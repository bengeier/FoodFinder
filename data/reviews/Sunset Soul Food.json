{"text":"Food is SO good, delivery driver was great. Only sad part, they forgot my strawberry cake ):"}
{"text":"These reviews are very mixed, I nervously ordered lunch take out.  The fish and shrimp were great, the mac and cheese was ok, we will definitely eat here more often"}
{"text":"Went last night and picked up a to-go order of fried chicken, fried okra, and white rice and gravy for my bf; I had grilled fish, Mac n cheese, mixed veggies and fried shrimp. My bf said the fried chicken and okra didn't have enough breading, he likes it crispier. I loved my tilapia ( best I've had)! Everything I had was seasoned perfectly! Would go back just for that!!! Even though it was packed, the customer service was excellent too!"}
{"text":"I stayed in North Charlotte for a conference and wondered where I should go to eat dinner. I looked on Yelp and saw the posting for Sunset. I noticed all of the great reviews and decided to go there. When I arrived, I was greeted with warm smiles and prompt attention. I ordered the fried catfish dinner with collard greens, potato salad and Mac and cheese. The food was outstanding. I enjoyed the tangy taste of the collards and the fish was seasoned perfectly. It was a great meal. The only thing I can complain about is the time it took to receive my meal. It wasn't an hour, but for the people there it seemed that it shouldn't have taken as long as it did. Overall though, a great place that I will revisit when I return to The Charlotte area."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try out this place on a Friday evening. We walked in and noticed there were about 10 people in there waiting for food there is no signs or anything so we just walked to the counter and looked over the paper menus and then ordered. I ordered the tilapia dinner with mac and cheese and collards with a roll. My boyfriend ordered the fried pork chops with mac and cheese and collards and cornbread. So we went to a table in the corner and waited for our food. After about 20 minutes the lady called out our order we got up got the order and headed home. We get home my boyfriend order was accurately fixed the pork chops were seasoned just right the mac and cheese was really good and the greens weren't so good. I opened my box to find that my order was wrong. instead of tilapia i received whiting, instead of the roll i ordered i got a piece of cornbread instead of collards i received mac and cheese so i have whiting with double sides of mac and cheese and a piece of cornbread. I'm actually glad they gave me double mac because after tasting my boyfriends collards yuck. The customer service is just ok and the food is decent next time i'll call in my order to avoid a long wait and i'll check my order before leaving. I will try again even though first impressions are usually good they deserve another chance to make me a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Good meal.  I had fried shrimp, crab cakes, greens, rice and peas.  I had intended to order grilled, but the fried shrimp were delicious - excellent quality shrimp and you could taste it.  The crab cakes were also delicious."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant of all times.  The food is awesome.  The sides are bananas."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! I went I this place on a whim. IM new to Charlotte and was stopped by the nearest UPS store on the map to ship a package. This place is a hidden gem! This is the best soul food I've had in a LONG time. I had the catfish and wings combo with Mac and cheese and collard greens. Delicious!!  Although the restaurant seemed popular and busy, I was able to get my food in 15 mins as a walk in. This is real comfort food. It's rich and well-seasoned. The service was pleasant. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"OK spot to visit if you are on that side of town.  I traveled approx. 18 miles to try this establishment and I don't think its worth 18miles.  However, I would visit again if I happen to be in the area and have a taste for some friend shrimp.  Their fried shrimp was (4)starts! I had fried crabcake, shrimp, fries & coleslaw.  I asked if the crabcake was lump meat and was told yes.  I believe it was, but it didn't cut it for me (too breaded).  Maybe my expectation is high in regards to crabcakes (me being a DC native).  Anyway the service was cool and I would visit again."}
{"text":"What a great menu. I have been two times, love it. crab legs and shrimp amazing. the whole family enjoyed."}
{"text":"I tried Sunset Soul Food for the first time today. I must say, I am very happy that I did. I ordered online through the Yelp app which is very very convenient. When I walked in, I was happy to see a Tyler Perry Cast behind the counter. Just good ole down home people laughing and enjoying what they do. Just the atmosphere let me know that I was in for a culinary treat.  I ordered the wing/whiting combo. For only $13.00 trying both their chicken and fish with two sides is a bit of a bargain really. I have to say, what I got was well worth it. They truly believe in giving you a down home country size portion for your money. I didn't expect the bag to be so heavy.  Now the flavor of the food was a welcomed surprise. Where most places are a bit heavy with the seasonings, I can gladly say that this was not. My chicken and fish were both fresh and delicately seasoned. The flavor of the meat stood out for me. This was a pleasant surprise. Hush puppies were crisp yet moist. Now the potato salad, was a slight disappointment. But when competing with my sister Lil'Bits potato salad, most others usually fall short. Yeah, I'm completely biased. Sue me. Now, Da MacNCheese is one of the best I have had here in Charlotte. Somebody's Grandmomma did a lip smack in good job with this batch. Remember what I said about portions, I got a double portion. I guess they don't believe in wasting plate space. That was a happy lil surprise for me. I also got a peach cobbler for dessert. Not the best I've had, but the crust is flaky, it isn't too sweet. In fact it is pretty good.  I took off one star only because of the dinning room. There is no real organization. For carry out, I HIGHLY recommend giving them a try. I know I will become a regular. But, I don't see myself dining in, at least not at this location."}
{"text":"Outstanding food!  Very nice people!  Awesome service. You need to try the Crab Legs, Mac Cheese and of course the hush puppies."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I've eaten here, and the whiting fish was soooo good! However, this visit was not good! The fish didn't taste like I remembered...I think the breading was different. AND THE HUSHPUPPIES WERE TOUGH!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Sunset Soul Food, I usually try to stop in at least every two weeks.  For some reason, I just can't get enough of their desserts.  The chocolate cake, peach cobbler and sweet potato pie are all to die for.  I'm not a huge fried seafood eater; so I can't really comment on their seafood, but to date I haven't been disappointed with anything I've eaten here.  I was even brave enough to give their chitterlings a try and I was pleasantly surprised :)  To my knowledge most of the fried items are cooked to order; so if you're getting something fried, I would plan on around a 20+ minute wait.  The overall restaurant is rather small; if memory serves me correctly they only have about 4 tables and a few seats along the wall near a pub shelf.  I typically get take out, and I wouldn't recommend taking a large group (5+) to dine in.  One interesting thing about this place, is that they also cook Thanksgiving and Christmas turkey dinners.  I've had them do my Thanksgiving dinner for 2 years in a row now and my friends have always been impressed with the meal.  The pricing is fairly reasonable to, if I remember correctly a turkey, with 3 sides, rolls, gravy and a pie run around $69.  Customer service wise, the staff is friendly and fairly attentive."}
{"text":"If you know what a \"fish fry\" is then this is your spot! Everything is good and made when you order. REAL seafood!  Primarily take out although they do have some limited seating."}
{"text":"So I'm sitting home alone, starving and hubby has the car. I find this place on yelp and I am skeptical. Now I'm fairly new to Charlotte and have been disappointed by a couple of places that have promised good soul food. This however, is not one of those places. I ordered the food though the Yelp app and it showed up way faster than they said!!! Delivery guy was very easy on the eye (Ijs) and the food was amazing!! I got the oxtails over rice and the Mac and cheese and the peach cobbler (whaaaat? It's a cheat day!!) and enjoyed all three. Remind me off great food my Nanny would cook when we were kids, and that peach cobbler was just... Idk, I'm still lost for words....I really think you will love this place, I know I do...."}
{"text":"Hey America, today  at Sunset soul food was a distasteful experience I've ever had in my life! Customer service was ok but the food was the worst! Nothing came with seasoning except the french fries. The mac n cheese  was a greasy cheese taste with no flavor at all. Me and my wife will not be wasteful anymore about spending hard earned money on a very distasteful restaurant. I feel that if im going to spend high menu prices then i need to be getting some spices in my food! For the people who would like to come and check this restaurant out always and remember to bring your season rack!!"}
{"text":"OM-Friggin G! This place did NOT disappoint. Totally satisfied this southern girl's taste buds! The seasoning of the catfish was on point. The collard greens, candied yams, & shrimp hands down were so good I promise you I thought I was enjoying a home cooked meal at my grandma's...& ya'll know grandma's can cook! Side note, they delivered quickly and the delivery guy was nice. Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Tried it on Sunday looking for a really good after church meal. It was okay. I ordered turkey wings, macaroni and cheese,  collard greens, and red velvet cake. The food was extremely salty and they forgot to give me my red velvet cake. The young lady at the register was unprofessional and pulled out the calculator to add up my food total. I probably will not be returning. I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Charlotte. The customer service can be pretty bad but the food is generally good."}
{"text":"Great great great food... Love the fish sandwich ... And my daughter had the chicken & waffles... Yum. Great food great service... A new favorite place!!!"}
{"text":"Even though I have passed by this restaurant for a few years now I always seemed to hear mixed reviews. As far as accessibility. It's not! If you have a wheelchair or a mobility scooter you will not be able to independently get through the \"maze\" of tall tables and chairs! I ordered that day a large order. A large whiting fish order. Tasteless. And a shrimp order with fries. The shrimp was great. I had many shrimp. And it was reasonably priced. I also tried lemonade and that was good. I had some kids with me. So we decided to order the children's meal. Chicken fingers and french fries which was accompanied with this I drink we thought. The drink that they give you is a small box drink and my kids we're not happy with that! I think for the money and small drink of lemonade or punch would have been nice. Overall the service was nice and the wait was adequate."}
{"text":"I've eaten there twice so far and both times were pretty good. I got the entree for 2 and the proportions are really nicely sized. They offer shrimp, wings, fish as well as two sides. I had Whiting for the first time and I'd have to say it was my favorite part of the meal. This is a go to spot if you have a taste of soul food."}
{"text":"Good food and plentiful portions. My first time ordering from them was a pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"I was lured into Sunset by a yelp coupon, and it was so good, I went like 4-5 times in the next three weeks. The collard greens are REALLY good. Not all porky, or vinegary, or salty. (no clue what they season them with, so I can't promise it isn't pork, just none in the greens.) Whatever it is, it's bangin. Same with the mac and cheese. Also the cornbread is sweet and good. I also endorse the yams.  That said, I have to knock off a star. The fried flounder is good, but not great. But the tarter sauce that comes with it however is disgusting. The mashed potatoes are only okay. The ambiance is lacking, BUT they always have Soul Train on from back in the day, which makes me nostalgic. But, I've picked up food maybe... 8 times, and my order has been wrong a couple of times. Once, I ordered and got home to find I had a roll (def not fresh) instead of their amazing fresh cornbread. People. I wanted my cornbread. (yes, it's that serious.) Not pleased. Apparently, they ran out and just gave me a roll instead but didn't tell me when I ordered or picked up. To their credit, I called and let them know I was disappointed, and the next time I got an \"extra\" cornbread. (woo!) Another time, I got green beans instead of collard greens. You know that's not okay, because I told you how I feel about the collard greens. I called and next time, I got my \"extra\" collard greens. But then the cornbread was wack. It was just mealy and thin, like it didn't rise. It's been the business every other time, so I'll just assume someone forgot the baking soda and move on. It happens to the best of us.  All around, good, and I recommend, but sometimes they make mistakes- unfortunately, a bit more often than they should. They do make it right but they lose a star because of it. Give them a try, but double check your order before you leave!"}
{"text":"Stop, don't read another review, just stay away from this place. I ordered a whole fried catfish, chitterlings, oxtail entree, and various sides. Total: $40.68 for two people. To start, the sides are mediocre and you will not remember them; just as I do not remember them. The catfish was okay, a lot of oil. The chitterlings are not chopped at all and resemble the texture of leather. I am from the country and I know there is no way they properly cleaned them. Now!!!, the whole reason I came were the oxtails... please do not make the same mistake. It was the worst oxtail meal I have ever had. They were tuff and  non-enjoyable. The meat literally would not come off the bone. They clearly did not allow proper cook time. All I can say is if you eat here order small and leave. And oh yea you can buy a fake purse from the guy standing outside the main door."}
{"text":"First off they say they open at 11..the cook was late so they ended up opening at 1120. Second my croaker I ordered tasted terrible like it was old fish. The lady at the front register has a terrible attitude and is not friendly at all. Won't return food is greasy and it taste like its fried in old oil."}
{"text":"I ordered on postmates. This was my 1st time using the app. I had a taste for fried ckn and  this place was closest at the time we ordered. Ordered the food, when it came we had 3 dinner rolls instead of cornbread like we ordered. So I called the store. The woman that answered seemed a little tudy but it was the end of the night so i let it pass. She said to call after I made my next order and she would give me 3 cornbread. The chicken I loved, the whiting not so much,the mac n ch was pretty good, didn't like the slaw. My family didn't like the food at all. The next day I just so happened to be in that area so I stopped in to get more ckn wings and the cornbread she said she would give me. The 2 women at the front weren't very welcoming at all. I ordered my ckn then mentioned the night before  (and it was her that  I spoke with). She just looked at me with this attitude like ok so! Then she said \"I'll put it in the bag\". She said 10-15 min so I sat in my car because it was really crowded. 15 min later I go back in, I'm standing in the front by the dessert fridge. I'm just watching and waiting for my food. I'm not the only one who got attitude, other customers were experiencing the same thing.   I must have stood there for about 10 or 15 more min. She looked at me a few times never said anything.  Then after she helps all the customers in line, she looks at me and says \"here you go, I called your number\". I took the bag and said thank you, got no response! I didn't appreciate the  service and then she only gave me 2 cornbread lol."}
{"text":"I found this place because of the good reviews on Yelp and I must admit, it did not disappoint!  I had the fried pork chops which were perfectly seasoned!  I had sides of mac-n-cheese and greens.  They were both good also.  I brought about 5 of my friends at later times and they've all loved it.  The shrimp was deliciously flavored and was one of my favorites as well.  The price was perfect.  I definitely recommend that you try it out.  The owner was very nice also and remembered who I was each time I came back.  Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Stayed at the Microtel While in Charlotte for the DigiTour concert.   While checking in I asked the associate  a lovely lady name Camie  where is the best place to get some Down Home Food , Ms. Camie highly recommended Sunset Soulfood  less than 1/2 from the hotel. This Soulfood is  Amazing I had the best fried boneless chicken I've ever eaten in my life and fried to absolute perfection , the collards like manna from heaven and the mashed potatoes and gravy too.  My husband had and love the bone in breast .  I miss my granny's cooking (Tarboro, NC) and Sunset Soulfood took me back there.  Sweet potato  pie was Yum yum .  I wish I could have stay longer in Charlotte just to try everything they make .  Thanks so much for the exceptional customer service , and the generous take out proportions ."}
{"text":"Excellent Food!!!! I'm going again today I will spread the word keep these folks in business!!!  Taste like they got big mama in the kitchen!!!"}
{"text":"If you eat Porgie this is the place to hit u, the crabcakes are large and full of crab meat.... Real crab meat..."}
{"text":"The chicken is excellent. The breading on the catfish and shrimp is good but the catfish itself seemed lost in the batter. I tasted more batter than the actual fish."}
{"text":"Rude and nasty! Customer service is -10 stars and food is at best 1 star. I imagine this restaurant wont last for many years to come unless it's just being supported friends and family bc I couldn't imagine to many people making multiple trips with all the amazing food options Charlotte has to offer."}
{"text":"I ordered the catfish combo with greens and okra, along with a slice of coconut cake. I requested that the catfish be fried hard. My catfish and okra were both lightly coated. Neither of these items had a crunch. My order was \"to go\", so it is possible that the steam from the greens may have created excess moisture. I absolutely hate soggy fried food!  My grandson loves fried pork chops and we ordered the fried pork chops with rice and candied yams. My grandson was unable to eat his fried pork chops. I think that the pork chops were oven fried (like a shake and bake texture)..anyway they too were not crispy and had a soggy texture to them. The candied yams were horrible and tasted as though they were served right out of the can. The greens and the coconut cake were average.  Service: When picking up my order the female behind the counter was not very personable.   I appreciated the fact that I had the ability to place my order online. I also commend the young man who answered the phone when I called to complain about the food.. He was very polite, professional and apologetic; unfortunately, this is not enough for me to ever want to go back and experience this disaster of a meal."}
{"text":"I ordered the fried perch fish sandwich.  I was pretty good.  Nothing spectacular, but not bad either.  I've had the fish sandwich a couple times but that's about it.  I do plan on trying the fried shrimp in the future. I've heard good things about it. I can only visit places like this on Saturday or Sunday as I try to \"eat healthy\" Monday through Friday.  However, I am looking forward to seeing what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"Placed takeout order online and it was ready upon my arrival. I had the croaker and wing dinner with cabbage and plantains. The croakers were excellent , however the wing we're fried too hard. The plantains were dried out and the cabbage wasn't that tasty at all. Not sure if I will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and this time was the last. Got home my food was wrong and cold. I always want to give them another chance because they are black owned but they let me down one to many times."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times now. I always get the pork trotters which are consistently good. I've had the collard greens & mac & cheese sides. Both of these were pretty good but I've had better.   The only dish that I really didn't care for was the fried fish. It was so bland. I don't even think I ended up eating the whole thing.   Overall the food is good & I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I loved it. I had the peach cobbler with was excellent and the perch was perfect. The greens had a little too much salt in them but they were still really good. I used to go to Bubba's BBQ but this will be my new spot when I'm on that side of town. I want to try everything.  It's a very small area so I'm not sure it would be the place for you if you have more than two or three in your party. The people were very friendly and down to earth. The cook even came out to talk to me. He's funny. I liked him a lot.  I think you should try it. It's real southern cooking."}
{"text":"The map pin is WRONG! Follow the actual address to 5009 Beatties Ford Road. Great food and service but the place is small ."}
{"text":"The food was seasoned in pure salt and lacked flavor. I ordered smothered turkey wings, collard greens and rice and peas. The turkey wings were overcooked. The gravy had no flavor. The collard greens were extremely salty and most likely canned. The rice and peas were excessively dry. I also ordered flounder (grilled) that was salty. I'm pretty sure it was Tilapia. Customer service was not the best. Definitely my first and last visit. I was looking forward to some authentic Charlotte food. Sadly, I'm left trying to get this salt taste out of my mouth."}
{"text":"Food always good, my favorite are the side. Sometimes amount of food is not worth the price. Have received different size of containers for same price for food. Sometimes larger."}
{"text":"This place has the best smothered pork chops in Charlotte. The customer service is great and the prices are not bad. I've also had the fried chicken wings and they are to die for.  I frequent this place often."}
{"text":"The pictures look great. I had fried pork chops, broccoli casserole and Mac n cheese. The pork chops were over cooked and dry. The broccoli and cheese casserole was mushy and tasteless. The Mac n cheese was ok but again tasteless. Big disappointment."}
{"text":"The food was tasty but cold after I ordered at 6:22 and the driver called to tell me he forgot the address and is lost. I then tell him where the apartments are then I had to stay on the phone with him. He was a nice guy but my food arrived at 7:51. The expected arrival time is 45mins to an hour. The manager did provide compensation of discount delivery fee."}
{"text":"So based on the reviews I was eager to give this place a try. I've been on a search for a good soul food restaurant in Charlotte and can't seem to find one. Sent my fiancé to pick up the food and when he got there, he texted me that the employees were rude. I was hoping to be able to overlook that if the food was good but I was disappointed. I had the beef stew which was tender but needed salt. The broccoli casserole was pretty good but the dressing was probably the worst dressing I've ever had in my life. My fiancé ordered barbecue and dressing as a side and he couldn't even finish it. My son was the only one who seemed to enjoy his food, he had barbecue ribs. With all stated, I'm not sure why there are so many good reviews. This was probably one of the worst soul food restaurants I've eaten from. Don't believe the hype. Sadly I'm still on my search for great soul food."}
{"text":"Well, had it not been for the BF I would have  never gone to this place. He is quite the \"Regular\" , so I trusted his judgement. If you go, definitely go for the food and not expectations of a fine/casual dining establishment. It's just what the name implies-- a gril and very limited space in a strip mall. There are a few tables if your small party decides to dine in.   I have to agree with other posters that the fried shrimp is deliciously prepared with just the right about of seasoning and breading, so were the okra. This is a big plus in my book where some places tend to go overboard. :)  The pintos did lack flavor, but again the fried shrimp stole the show. By the way, they do not stock fountain drinks, so if you want a soda it will be in a can--of course that means NO refills. They do also offer lemonade, half&half ( tea and lemonade) and water. Would go back again."}
{"text":"I have ordered from Postmates on about 3 occasions and this food is BOMB. Its the best soul food I've had in Charlotte thus far, however I've only been here 6 months. I've had the following items:  -Fried Chicken (10/10) The most amazing crust and seasoning and the meat is moist/seasoned. They aren't small portions either. -Baked Chicken (8/10) I thought it was a smidge salty and considering I ordered fried I was a bit disappointed. -Candied Yams (10/10) Best I've had so far, it wasn't drenched in corn syrup and the sweet potatoes weren't cooked to the point of being mashed. A generous amount of cinnamon. Just Yummy! -Mac and Cheese (10/10) My FAVORITE thing to get from this place. It's not the loose, liquidy type M&C (they serve @ NaNas Soul Food-GROSS). It's cheesy and has an awesome flavor. -Broccoli Casserole (3/10) Super bland and mushy, wont be having that again -Potato Salad (10/10) Man this potato salad is OUT OF THIS WORLD. Chunky,creamy,I believe it has relish, its just DELICIOUS. - Cornbread (10/10) Firm and moist , tastes fresh and not boxed (Like Soul Central Soul Food) -Fried Cat Fish (10/10) tastes bomb af   We did drive to the location one time with the intention of eating in, HOWEVER upon parking(which was limited and tight) we decided against it. It's small and there were what looked liked a bunch of guys just \"hanging out\". We weren't interested in what the vibe looked like. ORDER DELIVERY"}
{"text":"Okay I am brutally honest with my soul food and I gave this place 2 chances to meet my lowest expectations. Only because the best soul food comes out of my kitchen. The Mac n cheese needs cheese. My cabbage had been scorched. The fish was frozen I know its not fresh but it tasted frozen. These are the basics. I understand that this is the south but we need southern soul food to raise the bar and not accept anything. I am being generous with 2  stars."}
{"text":"There's a man who comes there every night for dinner and tells customers that if they don't like the food he'll pay for it. He hasn't had to pay for someone else food in 17 years!  Great food, generous portions, friendly people."}
{"text":"Legit. All you could want and more for true southern soul food. The dining room is nothing special, but all you really need is a chair and table to enjoy the meal. Heaping portions and everything is delicious. Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first time I went in and ordered. My food came out in a reasonable amount of time and it was very good. This time, I ordered through Yelp! I've used this feature before with another restaurant and I loved it. Although there was a little confusion when I called to follow-up, my order was ready! I didn't have to wait at all. This time, my food was GREAT! I remember enjoying it the first time, but this time...I could've inhaled the entire order. It was a feast for two, so that would've just made me a pig {insert oink here!}. But seriously, I have now put Sunset in my \"FAVORITES\" collection in my bookmarks and they are officially my go-to restaurant when I want fish, and shrimp. The cornbread is great too. Unfortunately I'm cutting back on carbs, so with every bite, there was a tinge of guilt. OH WELL!"}
{"text":"The food is great! A gem in terms of true southern cuisine. I felt like I was eating food from my grandmother's kitchen and was so excited to find this spot. Also if you have family members who like  southern delicacies such as chitterlings but you hate the way they make your house smell, this place has you covered!"}
{"text":"When I am anywhere on this side of town I eat here.  The food is always well prepared and delicious. I love the staff and their no-nonsense and genuine approach. Great seafood, soulfood and veggie options. They don't miss a thing! I've been coming since 2013. Look out for the daily specials. This place gets crowded eventhough most patrons place their orders to-go. If you are in a rush then call ahead to order."}
{"text":"At Sunset Soul Food (SSF) they serve up some really good, down-home, southern style Soul Food.    I've had the chance to try a few different things from Sunset - the Crab Cakes are what I usually run, and I have to say, they are better than you might expect.  I mean they aren't Baltimore Inner Harbor good, but they are Beatties Ford Road GREAT!  I've also tried the scallops, and the wings and would order both again without question.    But listen people, this place is worth going to for the SIDES alone.  You simply will not find Candied Yams any better in this city.  The Mac-n-Cheese?  What?!?!  Out of this world!  Cheesy, greasy and horrible for you, just as good mac-n-cheese should be!  Can't give this place 5-STARS however bc of the ordering process.  There are all sorts of rules and stipulations such as $5 delivery charges, minimum orders for delivery,  and you can't even place a pick-up order over the phone, I believe you have to do it all online now.  Then if you go and order in person, you are usually waiting due to the fact that business is always steady and that each meal is made to order.    Despite the quirks about the ordering process, SSF is a solid 4-stars and a must-try if you're in the area (or even if you're not).  Don't play with this spot, you won't find better soul food in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Was looking for best Mac n cheese charlotte and came across this place! And I will say I was totally impressed with their Mac n cheese!!! I ordered some fried chicken and it took 30 minutes!! But their chicken is made to order! And after eating it, it was worth the wait!"}
{"text":"You better call in your order first because it's going to take awhile. I've had the oxtails, shrimp, fish, & turkey ribs,  & mac n' cheese (not all that great). These california taste buds are spoiled with yummy soul food, but this place didn't quite make the cut. They should really work on some new recipes because the food tastes bland and basic, although the sweet tea and lemonade tastes wonderful.  Will not be revisiting."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here and I was impressed. The food had good seasoning on it. I had the meal for 2. It had fish, shrimp, chicken, cornbread and 2 sides(mac n cheese, coleslaw).I had it delivered and I thought it was going to be cold but I was wrong it was still warm. They gave me a lot of tartar sauce which I asked for. The cornbread was good because it was not too sweet. I got a good bit of food for what I paid. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, but they just haven't delivered for me on just my second visit.  I've tried the fish and chicken and a few sides and everything was just alright....perhaps my expectations are too high, but I will try them once more.  I think if they focused more on the seafood it would be a little better but they're basically a soul food restaurant that sells fish and shrimp."}
{"text":"I love soul food especially fish, chicken,  collards, and mac-n-cheese.  Huge let down here in light of those who love it at the 5 star level.  I ordered my meal at 11:35 am, and rang out 35 minutes later (-1 star).  I haven't even started eating, either.  I should've checked my order before leaving 'cause I got potato salad instead of mac-n-cheese (- 2nd star).  However, my server was the glaring, non-smiling church Aunt and not the happy-go-lucky, smiling, cheery guy (see other reviews), so I didn't really want to add another wrinkle to her furrowed brow, YKWIM?  The chicken was plentiful and the collards tasty, but they were very salty even for me who salts everything.  My chicken breast was so big it looks like the local cock fighting prize rooster finally lost and made it onto my plate.  Unfortunately, they butchered him a second time by frying away every last ounce of life.  Just a big, beautiful dry hunk of meat.  Sorry, champ (-3 stars).  For me, on this visit, it was just meh."}
{"text":"There are few places that I would drive 30 minutes out of my way to go to, but Sunset is one of them! I remember eating there about a year ago when passing through...so when I returned, I searched and searched until I found the place again. The fried chicken reminded me why I love the South so much! It was crispy and juicy and overall amazing. The mac and cheese will stick to your ribs...and you'll feel horrible about your life after...but while you're eating it, it will feel like the greatest decision you've ever made. You can't go wrong with this place. Do yourself a favor and make your way there."}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery so I don't have much to say about the aesthetic of the facility.  The delivery driver was so kind, if all of the staff has his sincere enthusiasm then I can't wait to be a dine-in guest. I ordered the wings dinner, with mac&cheese and potato salad and rice with gravy.  I didn't like the potato salad, the mac and cheese didn't quite meet my expectations, the gravy was great and the wings were nice and perfectly fried. I also got peach cobbler (my weakness) and it was yummy.  I heated it up and added some ice cream and it was perfection.   I will be eating here again!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here off and on since opening. I love their fried shrimp.  Their grilled seafood reminds me of seafood spots  in Harlem (love it).   I can't believe I was coming here so long and not getting anything grilled (seafood).  The specials posted on the wall and the daily specials posted behind register are different items from menu so def  check  those out.  My fiance loves their turkey ribs. Ordered grilled shrimp with peppers/onions over red rice (yahhhh i have been looking for this red rice since moving to NC 10 yrs ago lol) today. OMG....where has this dish been my entire life lol.  Grilled Tilapia w/ pepper and onions is great too."}
{"text":"First time at this eatery ... and the last!! First the order was wrong. We ordered wings and shrimp and whiting and shrimp. Guess what!  No shrimp in our order.  Couldn't find order because they hear Rochelle instead of Michelle.  Entire experience was a hot mess.  Called back to fix the situation.  They knew they messed up but offered no apology.  Mikala just said come back and get shrimp.  Finally, the food wasn't that good.  Won't go there again."}
{"text":"Received delivery out from here today for dinner for the family. It was good. I would recommend it. Looking forward to trying some other things too."}
{"text":"I'm not happy at all!!!!  It's bad enough that there aren't any soul food places on my side of town, I was hoping that this establishment would've been what I was looking for...missed the mark big time! First of all, the GPS wrong and you end up at the Food Lion across the street, so make sure you call and ask exactly where they're located and to give you a landmark.    I get there at 8:04 and place my order for a dark meat plate with Mac & Cheese and collard greens.  15 min goes by, then 20 min, then 30min and the guy finally comes out with my order.  He opens the styrofoam container and there are two dried out legs.  I looked at the guy and said sorry but, that's not what I ordered.  Then the girl that was at the register said oh yeah, they ran out of thighs and I forgot to tell you.  So after a few minutes of back and forth commentary, I asked the guy could substitute one of the legs with a few wings.  He said, let me ask and then he came back and said yeah, I could get two wings.    After waiting another 10 minutes, the girl pointed over to me and asked the guy at the counter...what happened to her, why is she still waiting?  I shrugged my shoulders and went back to watching tv.  After waiting another 10 min, I got so frustrated went to the register and asked for my money back and walked out.  I'll NEVER walk back into that place again.  I'd rather pay $10 and drive out of my way and go to Floyd's Soul Food on Graham Street or Nana's on Tyvola and Yorkmont Road.  Unfortunately since I wasted so much time, the other two resturant's were closed so I ended up with nothing."}
{"text":"I've ordered food from Sunset Soul Food more than 5 times. I absolutely love soul food period, I'm always happy! I recommend them!"}
{"text":"Excellent veggies and Mac&cheese. My mom had chicken livers and they were great too. The chicken tenders were moist and the yams were fresh not canned. This place is a must try. Definitely a hidden gem on Sunset Rd! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The fish and the side's were great The customer's service was great too Went back the next day to get sides"}
{"text":"I have never had southern food before. I had the Turkey Que with mac & cheese, collard greens and freshly baked cornbread. Everything was delicious! Hush puppies were good too! The servers were very friendly. This place has no ambience. This isn't the place to linger for hours over a meal."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to actually write about this place as the food was pretty good. Here is what got so many stars knocked off. I ordered the whiting sandwich. When the whiting sandwich came to me, it had 3 pieces of whiting. I'm guessing that the 2 on each side of the main piece was supposed to be a substitute for the bread. When my wife told me to just tell the waiter that the bread is missing I was skeptical because I said he knows.. when he bought the food out he stated whiting sandwich implying that we were on the same page and that was the food I had ordered. We were not on the same page at all and it seemed as if he was reading a different book entirely. I may not be a chef but I do know that the main staple food of ANY sandwich is the bread. The cashier seemed flustered that so much people was ordering during lunch that she couldn't keep up with the orders in a timely manner. I hate giving most places just a couple stars if the food was good but customer service and food management is a pretty big deal for me."}
{"text":"Macaroni and cheese is thick, five stars thick.  This side beat out my reigning champion by a sliver, but best is best.  The flavor was banging and the texture had me in hog heaven.  The fried fish is perfect.  I had the catfish and hubby hub hubs had the croaker.  He had to contend with bones throughout but a well prepared and plentiful portion of fish.  He liked his greenbeans and they quickly disappeared.  The croaker is not for the feint of heart because it is tricky not to get over anxious and end up with a mouth full of bones.  The catfish has no bones and plenty of crisp outside with moist tender insides.  I closed out with scrumptious candied yams that weren't too sweet and had a hint of cinnamon.  You got to taste the yams, thus avoiding a common candied yams mistake.  If dining in you have access to ketchup, hot sauce, and tartar sauce.  They are more than glad to have you dine with them.  Thete were only six tables, four of which had stools and high off the floor.  There is also a bar or counter with two seats available at it.  I am already planning my next trip.  Can't wait to try out more of the menu.  They have chicken livers!"}
{"text":"I heard the food was good. It's okay. The food was suppose to be delivered at a specific time and it wasn't. I waited about five minutes pass and called the restaurant. All the person could tell me was that there were no drivers at the store. I then got a call from the driver and I had to literally walk him to my home with verbal directions while he drove. I know I won't be ordering again for delivery and more than likely not takeout. It could be a one time issue but I don't think I'll eat here again."}
{"text":"The staff were nice with a great attitude.   The food was the worst. I ordered meatloaf, mashed potato with gravy and broccoli casserole. The mashed potatoes and broccoli casserole were okay. The meatloaf was DISGUSTING that I could not even finish the food. The whole plate went in the trash. I am so upset that I spend $15.00 on a meal that went straight into the garbage."}
{"text":"This was my first experience using the Eat24 app, and I loved it!  The service was fast and friendly and the prices were decent. I would encourage you not to order too much, just because the food is heavy! If a delicious food coma is in your agenda however, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"This Place is DISGUSTING...... I am located all the way in the Baltimore area However, I called to place an order for my elderly grandfather that is located in Charlotte. A woman answered the phone and started to place my order. She then proceeds to call me a SIR, mind you I am a 26 yo female with 2 kids. I corrected her and she then states YESSSS HONEY you sound like one of my friends. I find it utterly disgusting and a total lack of customer service skills. It's very upsetting that African American businesses lack the direction and intellectual capacity to interact with diversity. I'm not even what this woman implied yet she adamantly suggested different. I do NOT recommend this place and I'm filing a report to the BBB!"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to this establishment.  I was not disappointed.  I was allowed to taste the greens before I decided to order them. It was to die for. My entire dinner was delicious.  The fish was seasoned just right. The macaroni and cheese tasted like my grandmother's on thanksgiving day. The staff treated their customers like family. This place will be on my list of places to return when I come back to Charlotte."}
{"text":"I've eaten here once a month for nearly 2 years; let me tell you why: First, I can totally vouch for the fried whiting & croaker, mac&cheese, yams, and TURKEY RIBS WHICH ARE INSANELY WONDERFUL. I live 15 miles from the restaurant, and make the trip whenever I crave soul food & good company, which leads me to #2. The front counter staff (Dottie, Henrietta, and owner Ralph) treat you like family, which is really at the heart of a good soul food restaurant. Yes, it is located in a strip mall and is no where near \"upscale\". So what?!  What it IS is clean, well-lit with natural light, tiny & welcoming, and that's what REAL SOUL food is about! When I want upscale, I go upscale, but I have business & personal lunches here, and love to watch my guests enjoy the food & the staff despite the tiny modest set-up. It also sends a good message about the fundamentals of a good business. 70% of orders are for take-out, so there is much movement in & out the door, but there are about 8 tables of varying sizes to accommodate diners. As people wait for either their takeout or food to the table, strangers chat, and you discover who moved to Charlotte from where, and everything else beautiful about human interaction. For all you NYC transplants to Charlotte like myself, the owner Ralph is a native New Yorker, so the place has the authentic NYC soul-food 125th st vibe. Lastly, this is a small business putting out a great product every day ALONG with great customer care. They work hard together as a team, and it is really inspiring to watch, especially when that phone starts ringing non-stop with orders. They simply aim to treat you right, make sure you're comfortable, and make sure you're thrilled with your food. With the average meal with heavy portions setting you back a mere $10, how could anything be more perfect?"}
{"text":"True home cooked made to order fried chicken and whiting with a side of mac & cheese, collard greens, yams served piping hot.  5 stars to our waitress, Ms Bert, for delivering outstanding customer service with a spoonful of southern hospitality."}
{"text":"I just ordered to my hotel room using the app. The food is phenomenal, I'm only deducting one star because it took almost the whole 60min estimated time."}
{"text":"The food is consistently awesome. The Oxtails being my favorite. I hate cooking and the portions give me at least two meals so I'm happy!"}
{"text":"Dear God this food is amazing!!! Visited Charlotte from Baltimore and went on the prowl for some tasty soul food. Saw that this place received awesome ratings and it was only 10 minutes from hotel, so we went for it. A small storefront restaurant in a little shopping center. It is the last (or first) store and is in the corner. Upon walking in, it was pretty crowded but line moved quickly. Menu was great. Everything sounded delicious. Got the grilled shrimp and salmon with collard greens and macaroni and cheese. Talk about finger licking good...no leftovers from this meal and so well seasoned. Prolly wouldn't eat-in, but great food for carry out. Like really great."}
{"text":"I always have to stop by here to get my bangin peach cobbler! Delicious! Their Apple cobbler is good too."}
{"text":"I love giving my money to someone local. This place earned every penny I gave them. The catfish was phenomenal, fried squash and mac and cheese were great. Such a great local dive and a treasured place to get a bite."}
{"text":"Good is excellent when it's fresh. To many menu items can dilute the quality. The food choices need to be limited so they can make sure they serving fresh food all the time."}
{"text":"I'm giving the 2 stars based on the cake that I like & the 2 people I've encountered that were nice. I like the strawberry cake, but don't go here much because I don't know who I'll have to deal with when I'm there. The young lady that works the register with glasses is really nice. I talked with a young man on the phone to make sure they had strawberry cake before going & he was really nice also. He even volunteered to call me back & let me know when the lady that makes the cakes arrived, but the others...I just can't. After I paid for my cake the young lady told an older lady that was going from the front to back that she needed 2 slices of strawberry cake. She said we do have some right? The lady looks at me & says \"yes, but I wasn't planning on cutting it\". Then she proceeds to talk to a young man at the counter and after few seconds, says \"you want 2 pieces of strawberry cake\"? I mean mugged her just like she was looking me & said yes...silence...so I say thank you. She responds umhuh. I haven't been here in ~4 months because of scenes like this and that's normally how I space my visits. I don't have as much time to bake as I used to but I think I'm just going to figure out how to make a similar cake because I'm a stickler for good customer service. The food is ok but that's why I don't purchase it. I'm not giving them that much money. I don't understand this kind of service when I'm paying you. I work hard for my money & just prefer to spend it at places where they seem to appreciate my business."}
{"text":"This was my second trip there. The first was to get to know the place.  I was given a sample and it was delicious so I went ahead and ordered. not only for myself but my family as well.  We all enjoyed the food tremendously and we have no complaints.  My second time there we ordered Whiting Fish, Rice and Peas with Fried squash. We also ordered a Pork Chop sandwich. Once again we weren't disappointed.  Everything we ordered was delicious."}
{"text":"This place is very very small in a strip mall its half the size of most \"C\" stores . I saw the name and pulled in .As you walk in it was not a busy place at least when I was there and the workers where reading the newspaper I saw only 3. I had the fish sandwich now this place does not have yjr SQUARE FISH\" as does many chains that they put on their sandwiches. i mean Bojangles,Wendys, come on people you do not go to a place that is not true to their DNA in other words do not go to subway and get fried chicken. They actually use pieces of fish not the formed square fish I think it was haddock. Light breading toasted bun with home made tarter sauce good sandwich $6.00 and thats all you got. I hope their business picks up I know the rent at that location is very high. They also have other seafood shrimp calamari will stop again..."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely terrible and lady working the front was so rude. Fish extra salty & shrimp not seasoned I can't believe how terrible it was. I am in town visiting my best friend & never had such bad service and food in my life"}
{"text":"It's very rare for me to seek out Soul Food BUT, I found this place on Yelp a few days ago while search for top rating restaurants especially with favorites like mac and cheese.  This place stood out with the variety of choices and I like to support small businesses from time to time.  The servings were plentiful.  I Believe I had three pieces of catfish, about 4/5 pc of shrimp, mac n cheese, and mash potatoes.  It came with corn bread but I took a bite of it.  I definitely wanted to try the peach cobbler.  It was divine.  Plenty of spices and the crust was yummy good.  I would want to come back just for the peach cobbler and probably try a cake.  I had hope to get a free drink with my combination but that would have been unwanted extra."}
{"text":"This review is based on the food and delivery only as I've never been inside the restaurant... Food is amazing! I've had several things, fried wings, whiting and broiled flounder and all are soo good! Perfectly seasoned as you would expect. Sides: collards, mac n cheese, potato salad, rice n gravy are all delish. The loose corn I can do without, has some funky add ins with it that make it gross. Peach cobbler...yummy! Have it if u try this place out.  I get delivery from here bc there's not many places near me that deliver. The prices are good but there is a $5 delivery fee. Sign up thru grub hub and you'll get tons of coupons though. Timing of delivery sucks though! It's way longer than the estimated time given so be prepared. It's worth it though :))"}
{"text":"I am happy with the food that I ordered. I chose to get the catfish & chicken platter (with a side of collard greens, mac & cheese, and cornbread) for $14!!! That included two pieces of catfish and three chicken wings. The food was really tasty so I'm glad that I got more than my money's worth.   I placed my order online and went to go pick it up at the restaurant. The cashier did not acknowledge me upon arrival and I was the only one waiting in line, but several people that came in after me got helped before I did (and my order was sitting right at the counter). She didn't offer me any utensils, a straw for my drink, or napkins. She acted as if she did not want to be at work (an older lady). I was pissed by the pick-up experience which is why I gave them a 4 out of 5."}
{"text":"I came in on a Friday lunch hours thinking they would be busy but they were not. I ordered the crocker dinner with Mac n cheese and potatoes salad. While I was waiting 10 minutes for the fish to be cooked freshly I noticed the grade 92 and looked around the floors and tables were dirty. Anyway got my food to go. The fish was seasoned just right!!! The Mac and cheese was mushy with overcooked pasta and a offbrand cheap cheese not like I expected. The potato salad was cold and you could taste th garlic. Pretty goodn . it came with brick I mean cornbread.LOL it had no flavor and didn't taste like Jiffy cornbread. No sweet just tasted like a brick I took 1 bite and through it away. The coconut cake looked very appealing until I took the first bite. It was stale and taste like 2 day old cake not moisture at all. I was disappointed in the cake. If I come back again I will only.get fish!!! You can get it bake broiled or fried. Why was there no hour rush?!?! Oh now I know why."}
{"text":"I ordered food from their website (through Eat 24) about 6:30 pm, my order arrived at 8:05pm. I live 10 minutes from the restaurant! Smh! I had to call the restaurant 3 times to check and make sure they had my order. After the second call and waiting an hour, I called back and spoke with this rude man who yelled \"it will be there at 8:24\" . I will never go here again. Please know you may have good food but with poor customer service your growth will always be limited. I would prefer to drive across town to get some great soul food along with much more professional customer service."}
{"text":"Oh my where to be begin... Sunset was the absolute worst soul food I have had in my entire life! I'm not sure where the high stars have come from, but I can tell you they are completely false.  I Recently ordered a Leg & Thigh dinner with mac & cheese + yams with the additional sides of potato salad and dressing.   Simple breakdown-  The chicken, dry with an interesting twist of overly salty and flavorless. How can that be?  The yams, canned, dry, and no seasoning. I seriously feel as if they drained them from an expired store brand can and put them in my container. All bad!  The Mac and cheese... How does one mess up macaroni and cheese? Oh. By forgetting the cheese! I'm unsure how they were able to  turn the macaroni yellow because I can assure u there was NO cheese in it! I was baffled. I should probably give them two stars for being able to manufacture food that seemingly \"looks\" appealing but has completely no flavor. That's takes talent!   The dressing... OMG! As soon as it went in my mouth, it came out! It seriously tasted like month-old cornbread with a packet of ramen noodle seasoning on top. The gravy was just thick paste of no flavor!!  The potato salad.. They must have forgotten to add it to my order (although I paid for it) and  gave me canned greens instead.   If you're looking for decent soul food in the Queen City (lunch or dinner) try Luwans and/or Merts."}
{"text":"Food was excellent- I had the chitterlings with cole slaw and Lima beans - flavored to perfection and nice size portions.  My hubs had fried perch with Lima beans and corn and my daughter had chitterlings with Mac n cheese  and candied yams!!!! The sweet tea was like syrup wayyyyy to sweet for my taste.   Cornbread arrived hot moist and delicious.      My only complaint- not in the best part of town- and while there a gentleman came in and caused quite a disturbance with graphic language and physical threats toward the owners all over a 5 meal!!!    I will definitely return but only as a carry out customer!!"}
{"text":"Good food but service makes this place much less appealing. There are lots of other soul food options in Charlotte, but this place makes it seem like they are God's gift from soul food heaven. And the order was incorrect.   Ordered the shrimp, whiting, candied yams and baked beans. Whiting was a bit salty but it was all pretty good. Shrimp were fresh and large.  Candied yams were well seasoned and yummy."}
{"text":"I am usually ok with Sunset. I have ate here several times, i mainly enjoy their seafood. I like their clam strips, fried fish, shrimp, etc. And the prices are reasonable. the last time i went it took a long time, when i got there they asked me to pay and i already paid online, i asked for hot sauce and i order shrimp and fish they handed me 2 packets,so i was turned off. i get home they forgot my bread and i order rice with gravy and there was no gravy. Just rice. I was pretty furious lol. I wasn't going back for a cup of gravy. So i ended up going to the store by my house to buy some gravy so i could have it with my rice since it was closer. So that is why i am giving them a low rating this time around. Check your food on your own before you leave."}
{"text":"Stop in after reading yelp reviews. Place is very friendly. Food is excellent.  Had beef stew  cornbread. Collared greens. And new items fried plantains. All cook with pure soul of the owners positive energy.  Turns out owners was one of my customers from restaurant depot days.  So I know he buys qaulity."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Randomly found this restaurant and I'm glad i did. I ordered the fried oysters and it was amazing. Large portions - worth the price paid. Service on food was speedy. The cabbage and Mac and cheese was also well seasoned. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Decent soul food, not the best I ever had, but good. Takes a while to get your food, I get that the meats are cooked to order, but fish doesn't take 25 minutes to cook. I would go back , but only as a convenient last resort."}
{"text":"First time eating from here and the food was delish!  It was a last minute decision on a rainy night, so I read the reviews and saw I could order online.    I ordered for pick-up and the food was ready once I arrived.  The gentleman opened up each plate to show and ensure our order was correct; in which it was.  Once I made it home, I opened the box and began my feast.  The food was great overall and the portions were generous.  I will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"I ordered the wings and shrimp with mac and cheese, cabbage, and cornbread. The wings and shrimp was fried crisply. Great flavor not overbearing. Mac and cheese was good. Cabbage was below average. Cornbread was average. It was $15 and a lot of food so good value. Customer service was good and food prepared in great time. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"YALL. THIS. WAS. AMAZING. Literally sitting at my desk with the itis. I need a nap. This is a hole in the wall seafood and soul food joint and it did not disappoint. The food was very well seasoned and I didn't need to add anything besides hot sauce. I got fried chicken and 2 sides (Mac and cheese and greens). The Mac and cheese was delicious and reminded me of my god moms. I'll definitely be back! We waiting about 20-30 minutes but it was worth it just like the sign says in their restaurant. Be sure to call ahead!"}
{"text":"Ya'll are the reason why I can't lose weight lol! I've ordered from Sunset Soul Food about fifty leven times through Postmates (literally waiting on an order to be delivered as I type this) and have loved everything I've ordered. My favorites are the fried chicken, broccolli casserolle, mac and cheese, and ALL the desserts. I'm going to be so sad when I finally get it together and start eating healthier but I'll definitely still order every now and then on my cheat days."}
{"text":"Never again.  I placed an order at 6:30pm for takeout, with pickup at 7:30pm.  I drove twenty minutes out to the restaurant and showed up five minutes early.  I had to wait five minutes to even be acknowledged.  I was told the order wouldnt be ready for another ten minutes.  Thirty minutes later i asked about my order and the womab at the counter said let me check and went in the back.  She came out and didnt even look at me.  I left empty handed five minutes later.  I called and sat on hold for 15 minutes then they hung up on me.  Then i called back to find out my 6:30 order was ready at 8:20.  This wasnt on time, this wasnt ten minutes.  The utter lack of apology or any concern for lying to me.  The entire thing was a disaster.  The kitchen is disorganized, the staff are rude, and all this from a place that used to be great.  Dont go here ever, you will regret it."}
{"text":"This is a real hole-in-the-wall place, right by the UPS off of Sunset. The people here are always smiling, always friendly and always patient. They have a very varied menu and everything that we have tried here has been mind blowing.  We typically get the oysters (fried, of course), the shrimp po' boy sandwich and sides. All of their sides are yummy but we especially love the fried okra, baked beans and the mac n' cheese.  This one time we tried their crab legs which were delicious and so succulent too. Tried to reproduce them at home once when I was craving those legs but turned out pretty bad :) These guys must have magical powers to make everything taste so amazing. I wish they were closer to home or a little more on our way. But the drive here is worth it, every single time!"}
{"text":"Placed my order here on the yelp app, so i decided to call just to confirm that they recieved my order. The woman that answered the phone was very rude. I simply said \"Hi i ordered online and i just want to confirm that you have received my order.\" She said \"I have 6orders\" (thats not what i asked) i then said \"Ok, i am calling to confirm that you received MY order. I can give you the address & the name on the card i payed with.\" She says \"Ok. Yes it is here you will receive it within a half hour\" *CLICK* ARE YOU KIDDING ME????   Im sorry that I ordered online where i paid with my card and i want to confirm my order was received. Smh the nerve of that woman.   Ordered the crab cake dinner with collard greens and mac & cheese. Crab cakes were smushed thin and the batter used to fry then wasnt that great but the overall taste was decent. Also got the crabfish & shrimp combo which was good. No complaints about that. We also ordered 3 desserts a red velvet cake, peach cobbler, and a banana pudding. The only one that was good was the red velvet.   Ill have to give them 3stars. What was good was good and what wasnt wasnt."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a few times. Have the food delivered to our office for lunch. Very yummy!"}
{"text":"Chicken seasoned just right.  Everything was very good.  Definitely different."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for catfish, but live in California where there isn't much - so while visiting Charlotte, decided to take a trip out to Sunset Soul Food.  Was not disappointed.  Got the Catfish with the Mac and Cheese and Okra.  Catfish was delicious, Okra was cooked perfectly, not slimy like I've had in other places. Seasoning on everything was spot on.     This place is very busy as the phone rang constantly while we were there, it shows they are doing something right. I will be returning to Charlotte in May, and will definitely be stopping there again."}
{"text":"I got takeout her and thought it was pretty delish! The portions were large and I was able to make two meals out of it. I tried the catfish, greens and macaroni and cheese. The only thing I didnt care for much was the peach cobbler. It was passable but nothing too exciting."}
{"text":"Came here for take out lunch. Called ahead about 10-15 minutes in advance because that's what everyone who's eaten there told me to do to avoid the wait. When I arrived, they were still finishing up the order so it seemed like perfect timing.  I ordered the perch sandwich with fries, an Arnold palmer and the lemon pound cake.    The perch was well done and a nice healthy portion. The fries were perfectly cooked and nicely seasoned. The Arnold palmer was made from homemade sweet tea and lemonade and hit the spot.   The lack of a star is for the cake. Though touted as homemade, it tasted store bought and overly sweet and was served cold. It was the thing I was looking forward to the most and thing I was most disappointed by. The other let down was the value. It was a bit pricey for such a basic order, especially given that there are cheaper options of the same quality nearby (and with better cake).   The service was great and efficient. The staff are warm and friendly and willing to help. I would come back if someone in the office or friends were ordering from here. I was certainly intrigued by the fatback special on the menu (which I love but rarely get to enjoy) and the fried shrimp.  All in all a pretty good experience."}
{"text":"Great food (most of the time) but terrible customer service. I waited for over an hour for an order I called in after being told My order was coming out next. 20 or do orders later, I asked how much longer it'd be and the girl behind the counter (with half shaved Mohawk) turned and whispered to her coworker then said it'd be next (again). They proceeded to make it in that moment then had run out of a side that I order. The same cashier I mentioned before gave a free drink to man for his wait and he told her I'd been waiting longer and she said she knew and nothing else."}
{"text":"The food was really good. I had grilled shrimp with onions and peppers with a side of red rice. It came with a side salad as well for just under $11. You can't beat that and the food tasted home made. I've been back since then and will keep going back. Definitely added to my places to stop for lunch."}
{"text":"I was so happy I got this before I left Charlotte...the service was great and food even better! The half/half too...save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Today I had the fried pork chops with potato salad and collard greens.  Everything was seasoned nicely, nice sized portions, and a good price. I will definitely be back to try out more of this menu."}
{"text":"BEST SOUL FOOD IN CHARLOTTE HANDS DOWN! Every soul food place in Charlotte that I've tried seemed like a fast food based type place. I LOVE THIS PLACE! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I decided to order through one of the delivery apps. Food came fast, was fresh and delicious. The price was also very reasonable. What more could you ask for right."}
{"text":"I went with my family and we had a large order to go. My suggestion is that you call ahead for takeout and check your order before you leave. It took about 40 minutes to get our food and there were still some items missing. My parents said the oxtail was mediocre and I had the fried oysters which weren't too bad. Chicken livers were dry. Cabbage was salty and bland at the same dang time(???) And the cake tasted boxed but it wasn't bad. I would go again for comparison knowing what I know now but my one year old son didn't dance and hum while he was eating so I think he's over it."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Sunset awhile back when I visited Charlotte and am in town due to storm evacuation. I just called to see if they would be serving oxtails and chitlins today. The girl that answered the phone was very rude with a lackluster attitude. I kindly explained to her that because of this they will not get my business. I'm sure she doesn't care but I will not spend my money where it's not appreciated. I wish I could give them zero stars."}
{"text":"We placed a delivery order on yelpEats24 today  A large order  I'll first say after placing the order the restaurant called to let me know they didn't have grits today. Only weekends. So I got a sub ( perfectly fine with me )   Order arrived quicker then estimated time  Was hot and even being a large order it was correct   Everything was delicious !!!   The most friendly, down home service  (We are truck drivers and travel all 48 states)   When in the area we will for sure be ordering from here again !!!!"}
{"text":"You can use the Eat24 app to order food from this restaurant! It was my first time using the service and I really enjoyed the outcome. The downside for delivery is you have to spend at least $25 ($5 delivery charge not included) which was pretty difficult with the cheap prices!  The food was delivered to my hotel room in about 35 minutes and overall it was okay. The hot wings were amazing! The other food we got was mediocre, it wasn't the best, however, to feed a hungry stomach it did the trick. The gentlemen who delivered my food was also very polite and friendly!"}
{"text":"New to the Charlotte area from Connecticut and couldn't wait to try some Southern cooking. I first went La'Wans because of the reviews and I was so disappointed. The next day we found this gem. Scared of a repeat we ordered a variety of dishes in hopes of something tasting decent. But it was beyond that full of flavor, huge portions and hot food!! The best food I've had in the area so far!"}
{"text":"Sunset restaurant food was appetizing to me. I came here the day after Thanksgiving because I had to work and missed my family Thanksgiving dinner. The staff members were friendly and give you the space and time to order. I ordered rice, greens, and chitterlings. All my food came out hot and delicious. The store is not that big and small parking spots but other than that I give them Five stars in my book. Because they make you feel like your grandmas in the kitchen cooking."}
{"text":"Nice local spot offering a good variety of different fish species. The restaurant isn't exuberant or anything, just your average order at the counter place with many regulars on the weekends.   Batter is pretty tasty and fries and hushpuppies are okay. In addition to the traditional fish fry items they also offer snow crab legs, scallops and even salmon. Whiting fillets might come with skin and bones, so eat with care. A good sign of real fish though!"}
{"text":"Great food. Wonderful service. I love the sweet lady at the front! She reminds me of my mom! If you're looking for yummy fish and chicken dinners, mac n cheese, cabbage, rice n gravy and more...this is the spot to get that soul food fill from!"}
{"text":"Very casual atmosphere with excellent eats. I am hands down a fan of the fried shrimp here. They are a nice plump size and without all the bread crumbs on it instead they have light batter that they are fried in and they are simply delicious.   The mac and cheese is probably some of the best I have had since moving to Charlotte. The sweet potatoes surprised me. I typically enjoy them okay, mostly around holidays or in a pie or simply baked, but these bad boys right here - they were delicious and I couldn't stop eating them.  I really also enjoyed the cabbage but would pass on the greens.  The fish was pretty good, not the best I have ever had but it was pretty tasty none the less. And I really enjoyed their pig feet, trotters, whatever you want to call them. They were very tender and soft. The fried chicken wings were on point.  Definitely worth checking out if you are in the mood for soul food carry-out."}
{"text":"Ok let's start. The hubs and I have eaten here several times but make sure you prep your pockets first! To deliver, they have something close to a $30 minimum delivery charge so even on my worst days, I am hopping in my car, sweats on and hair tied to go pickup my food. The baked chicken isn't bad (I always need to ADD salt to it) but that's only if they give you the baked chicken you asked for. About 40% of the time I ordered baked chicken, I ended up with fried and with as long as it takes them to make your order (chicken is made to order, and I mean killing the chicken, plucking it and all based on the ridiculous time wasted sitting around) you will, listen to me...you WILL happily accept the fried chicken and be on your way. Next, the collards are some of the best I've ever had and the macaroni is good but mama and grandma do it better of course. The hubs always gets the tilapia and is slapping hot sauce on it and licking his lips before you can ask \"how does your food taste?\", needless to say, he loves it.  Now the service... If you get the men, they are great. The guys are friendly, talkative and professional but the women? Let me tell you about the women. There is this one woman in there who the hubs and I call Aunt Jackie because she seems like that mean aunt that used to \"give you that look in church\" when you were talking too much. I DREAD having to correct my order or asking for salt because of the looks she gives you; Oh and don't let it be busy pshhh. All I can say is the food is pretty good so we frequent the place but there are def. a few things that can be approved upon.   This is also more of a take your food and go kind of place, not really fancy or big enough to hang out with a large group and really enjoy a dinner."}
{"text":"Finally knocked Sunset Soul Food off my bookmarks list.  Got an order combo of fried shrimp and fried croaker with french fries and cole slaw.  First off, you order, then it gets cooked so, the fish, shrimp and fries were perfectly hot and crispy. Everything tasted good though the coleslaw was I tiny bit too sweet for me.  The only downer was pre-packaged tartar sauce vs. homemade but that's a minor irritation and would not at all be a reason not to eat here again."}
{"text":"The owner of this brand new restaurant has been catering for over 10 years. Incredibly friendly staff, with high quality BBQ. I recommend the pulled chicken sandwich."}
