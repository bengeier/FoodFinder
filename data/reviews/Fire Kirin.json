{"text":"Didn't get to taste the food. The service was so bad - as in, we were completely ignored - that we left. It was lunch hour. There was a large table getting attention from the one or two employees working on the floor - leaving customers at about 4 or 5 smaller tables twiddling their thumbs. When we left, a few of them did too. 

I'm not going back."}
{"text":"As a few other Yelpers have mentioned, this place has had many reincarnations. Its decor is nice and simple Its typical Asian and clean. 
To keep it short, the service was great, the ladies helping us very helpful. We were given an amazing red coconut curry soup. It was delicous, and not spicy (which is my preference). The Shanghai noodles with cabbage and chicken were also very well done. The cabbage wascrispy and the dish wasnt too heavy, like some noodle dishes tend to be. We werent as impressed with the Lemongrass Chicken, because it didnt have any lemongrass flavour, and the side of rice was dry. The red curry was not too bad, but again the side of rice dry.
Once we were done, we were given each a half of an orange, cut into fancy segements...maybe as a palate cleanser, which was nice because the oranges were perfectly sweet and tart. 
Overall, I would go back, if I wanted to stay in my area, and grab something quick."}
{"text":"Fire Kirin is a nice change from Royal Thai, especially given Royal Thai's demise in quality during its last few months of business. 

Other than a few slight changes to decor, and a couple of booths being ripped out, the interior is the same. What has been changed, and for the better, is the menu.  I could best describe it as a smattering of popular Asian dishes: Kimchi, Korean BBQ, pad thai, etc.,

For appetizers we tried the calamari and the tempura assorted plate. The calamari was fantastic, all four of us loved it. Very lightly battered and it came with a nice, spicy dipping sauce. The tempura was fine, nothing special, just normal tempura. Decent sized portions as well.

For mains, the table ordered pad thai, wasabi pepper chicken, and jumbo prawns. The pad thai was nothing to write home about, I have had better street pad thai in Thailand on styrofoam.  The wasabi chicken was good, came with rice and grilled peppers and onions, but again, didn't leave me wanting to come back to order it again. The jumbo prawns were indeed jumbo prawns. It came with five on the plate, rice, and some diced fried veg. 

For dessert we had the coconut ice cream, which had two scoops and was pretty good.

Service was okay, not out-of-this-world though. They restaurant ran out of menus and had to come and take two of our to give to another table. Once our food was served (quickly I might add), no one came back to ask us how it was and if we needed anything else, which we did.  But, for the most part, drinks and waters were refilled quickly, food came out quick and hot, bill was taken care of straight away, ever server was polite and smiling. 

Worth a visit, especially if you want to have something \"safe\" or have any picky eaters in the group, as the menu has enough choice for everyone. Prices are decent, helpings are enough to make you feel you received your fair share.

I will definitely give it a go one more time, hopefully I find the food a bit more inspiring. 

PS. They also deliver free of charge."}
{"text":"This place was not very impressive. It was flavourless and there was not very much sauce in the dishes. It is way to over priced for what you get. Probably wouldn't go to this place again."}
{"text":"Good food, excellent service, inexpensive -- what more could you ask for? Oh yeah, and a gluten free menu for me! Fantastic! We had Cajun Prawn Special for an appetizer, Kung Pao Chicken and Malaysian Curry Laksa. They were all very nicely presented and delicious! All dishes are MSG free.  I have eaten here twice now and both times it was very quiet, so my only fear is that if this place becomes popular, it will be hard to get a seat."}
{"text":"Over the last ten or so years, there have been at least three different restaurants at this location. I can see why they never stay because the restaurants are never really that good. Fire Kirin is no exception.

It's not a terrible restaurant by any means, it's just mediocre. Down in the south end, there are tons of mediocre restaurants struggling to make it big, and none ever seem to. Especially in this location, you really need to stand out to gain longevity like Newport Grill or Bill's. A random asian restaurant with no distinct identity is not going to cut it.

I came to this place expecting Thai. It was far from Thai. The menu consisted of many random stereotypical \"asian\" dishes.. and I mean \"asian\". The way I would describe this restaurant is a melting pot of different types of \"asian\" - Thai, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, and maybe add Malaysian in there for good measure. I realized after that they purposely did this to be some sort of contemporary \"asian\" restaurant. However, it was not really working with me. I wasn't getting anything authentic, and nothing I've never had before.

Since nothing was really standing out for me on the menu, I decided to order the Korean BBQ Beef, which I knew was not cut like you would get at a regular Korean restaurant. They gave you over-cooked slices of steak cooked in Bulgogi sauce. The steak wasn't very good, but I did like how they brought it out with some steamed rice, romaine lettuce, kimchi, and a condiment of some sort. Afterward, I ordered some coconut and green tea ice cream to end the meal. The green tea ice cream was actually very good. It was smooth and had a lot of green tea flavour. The coconut ice cream was more grainy in texture - often what happens when you make ice cream out of coconut milk - and it had real shaved coconuts in it. I think the ice cream and the complimentary oranges left me feeling pretty good about my meal. For that reason, I'm giving this place a 3. It's OK, but that's it.

{"text":"We ordered take out today. It was our first time trying Fire Kirin, and I've been desperate to find good Thai food in Calgary since moving from Seattle.

Well, the search continues. The service was quick and polite. What I saw of the interior was clean and well kept. Kenny G was inexplicably being piped into the dining area. 

We ordered Mongolian beef skewers, after we were promised they were super spicy. We also got pad Thai, no shrimp. No option was offered for a customized spice level but I requested spicy and they said they could accommodate. 

Portions were generous. In addition to the entr√©es we got a scoop of white rice and two green salads. The dressing looked suspect, so we didn't taste test it.

The beef skewers are so mild I would feed them to my 3 year old. They are unevenly cooked, some well done and some bordering on rare. The bell peppers and \"wok fried\" onions sat in a soy sauce based soup underneath the skewers and had a raw, crunchy taste that was tasty but not what was advertised.

The pad thai is awful. I'm sitting here staring at it, wondering if I can doctor it up to save it or if it's $13 in the trash. The rice noodles are over cooked and gummy. There is no taste whatsoever. The chicken is bland. The noodles are bland. The beam sprouts are bland. Just like the beef skewers, this is so mild you could feed it to a small child. There were no peanuts, no lime, no spice, no taste. I used easily 3 tablespoons of sriracha, trying to get some flavor or heat, but it would have been nice if the actual dish had had flavor to begin with.

We aren't coming back,  that's for sure. My hunt for decent Thai food in Calgary continues."}
{"text":"We had tried two Vietnamese restaurants in the area and both were closed so we headed to Fire Kirin for some Asian action. Previous experiences here had left us cold, literally. Just one more degree on the thermostat would possibly have me handing out another star. Nothing, however,had changed in this matter since our last visit.
We ordered a gyoza appetizer to begin. It was excellent and we were soon fighting over who should have the last one.
Next up came the Korean BBQ shared platter . It was served with four mini bowls of tofu, bean sprouts, Kimchi  and cubes of fried potato. Also, we received a small bowl of steamed rice each. The BBQ platter was a carnivore's manna. Chicken, beef and pork pieces rested on a bed of crisp lettuce. The meat was well flavoured and some dripped with tangy marinating sauce. I was happy, she was not. In no time she had polished off all of the lettuce as I gnawed contentedly on the protein. She seemed to be looking for vegetables but being that it was to be Korean BBQ,  it just didn't exist. To be even more authentic, however, the meat would not have been brought to us already cooked but rather with a small burner on the table for us to cook our own. 
We washed the meal down with a small glass of red and one beer. Total cost before tip, $67.00"}
{"text":"Outstanding!!! The Kung Pow Chicken and Pad Thai are delicious and elegant. Attentive  service. We love this place and have for years."}
{"text":"Walked in and was greeted instantly. When asked to review the menu women met my requests but gave a standoffish feelings. I would understand if I was dressed inappropriate for such an establishment."}
{"text":"I hate to put up this excellent review, but everything about the place deserves it - I just don't want lineups to start forming here - it's our favourite restaurant in the city. 

Excellent food that may be more appreciated by those with more of an international palate and at a bargain for the price with excellent service every time we have gone. Only once has it been louder than the usual below average sedate for the noise level."}
{"text":"Loved the food! We ordered three appies, two entrees, and dessert. All was wonderful! It is very beautiful and quiet inside and smells AMAZING - we were so excited to get our food.
We were a little concerned with how quiet it was for a Saturday night at 530, but we will definitely be returning with our friends for more."}
{"text":"Couldn't find anything wrong with this place.  atmosphere was not overstated .  Food is excellent, salmon was fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last night. Ordered one of their \"specials\" - a cashew nut chicken dish. The flavour seemed a little off to me and the chicken was... spongy? I thought nothing of it, perhaps this is just the way they prepare it. 

Turns out this is not the case. Myself and my entire family got food poisoning. I should have known the dish tasted off, but what can you do? My wife had a shrimp dish, my son shared from both of us. I'm writing this review because I was up all night violently vomiting while trying to manage a puking baby. 

Avoid this place. I'll be writing to the health and safety inspections folks next."}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout from here several times, and each time was disappointed. I would give the food a 4 out of 10"}
{"text":"Yayyy!

Finally a good go to hot spot to satisfy my craving of Asian cuisine, which is a rarity in SE Calgary.

There's ample room for seating. My favorite dish is their Ginger Classic Squid. I love my ginger beef, but this blows that out of the water. I look forward to ordering this every time I'm here. I don't know any other place that does this. I'm so glad the chef has introduced me to this little gem.

My other favorites include Kirin Jumbo Prawns, Golden Triangles (such a treat), and Laksa Noodle soup.

Their prices are hard to beat. 

Thank you Fire Kirin for serving fine, delicious Asian cuisine to SE Calgary. We need it badly!"}
{"text":"I've been to Fire Kirin on two different occasions. I agree with Carol K - the place serves 'Asian' food with no distinct identity. But that is not even the biggest problem with this place. 

The funny thing is, both times it came recommended by my coworkers of Chinese and Malaysian descent. The first time I went, I ordered the Kung pao chicken. Pretty good, pretty unoffensive, pretty Western dish. I would give it 3 stars.

The second time, I went with a Chinese coworker who expertly asked for the Chinese menu, and lo and behold the waitress brought over a separate menu. We ordered a bunch of dishes to share, and once again, they were pretty good. The fish hot pot was better than others.Still a 3 stars in my book at that point though, because one waitress was serving up 5 or 6 tables during lunch hour so service was extremely slow. We needed more rice and we had to wait for 10 minutes before the waitress saw us waving our arms frantically.

What brings this down to 2 stars is that near the end of my meal, I noticed a small hair on my plate. When the waitress finally came over, I politely showed it to her and asked her to \"just let the chef or staff know, because I am done my meal now anyway.\" She glanced at it and flipped off my comment with a \"Well, the chef is bald.\" I was surprised at her nonchalant behaviour and told her it was clearly not mine, because the short stubby black hair on the plate does not match my long hair. She just took the plate away saying she will let the kitchen know anyway, and sounded really annoyed that I pointed this out.

Did she apologize? No. Did she do anything at all to end the experience on a better note for me? No. Absolutely nothing. She gave us the bill, and went about her business.

I'm sorry Fire Kirin, but I dont think your food is THAT exquisite or one of a kind that I will be back despite this. Even if you DO have terrific food, in this day and age with so much competition, you need to train your staff better. I GET it that she may have been busy and overworked, but that is no excuse for flipping off a concern that the customer has, regarding something that was messed up in YOUR kitchen.

Bad form."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great friendly service. Love the oranges at the end to cleanse the palette. Try the emperors platter."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just decide to go out on a spur of the moment, not really expecting much, & then being vowed. Tonight was one of those nights!
The service was excellent. The staff were very attentive & polite. Always with a genuine smile. 
And then there is the food. We got the half portion platter for starters. It was so delicious, with variety of flavors & textures, and plenty for 4 people! 
Then came the entrees, which were just as good and portioned such that some had to ask for takeaway box. 
The dessert was not the best, but then again I'm not a big fan of Asian desserts. The green tea ice-cream was good. 
Would definitely go back there again. 
I forgot to mention that their ambience was very nice too!"}
{"text":"Excellent Crab Spring Roll appetizer, good pad Thai, excellent service (I was the only one in the restaurant for a time), good prices. This place was about what I expected and I'd return if I lived nearby."}
{"text":"My husband & I were planning to go to the Royal Thai which is now Fire Kirin. As we were already there we gave it a try and were more than pleasantly surprised. 

We were seated near the bar which looks into the exceptionally clean kitchen. All 3 servers were incredibly sweet & attentive. 

Bar prices were reasonable at $5 for an import beer. We started with the best Tom Yum Goong soup I'd ever had. It was so good my husband ordered a bowl after tasting mine. 

I had the Szechuan Fried Noodle and my husband the Singapore Fried Rice Noodle. Portions were generous and prices very reasonable. I would definitely recommend my dish. It was not too oily and just the right amount of spice. Vegetables were crunchy and the chicken lean. 

I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Some of the best contemporary Asian food I've had in calgary, especially the Kung Pow chicken, a personal favourite, and a few items from the alternative Chinese menu. Be sure to ask for it if you're feeling adventurous."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great prices why is this place empty on a Friday night.
People this place is great!"}
{"text":"So this building started out as Cannery Row, then it's been a couple other restaurants which included a Thai place. Now it's Asian fusion on the menu.

Everything about this place is a solid three stars. No more, no less. Except for the service, which is sub par. We were promptly greeted at the door and seated immediately in the almost empty restaurant. During our visit here the place started to fill up and by the time we left it was almost at capacity. There were three staff on the floor. A gentleman who seemed to be doing everything from greeting guests, seating them, taking orders, serving food, and ringing up bills. There was another gentleman who seemed to serve food sometimes and answered the phone, but not much else. Finally the woman working wasn't doing much other than filling the odd water glass, but only on one side of the restaurant. I felt bad for the guy doing everything, he was literally running back and forth between the tables and the kitchen.

We were never asked if we wanted drinks. After our order was placed we had to flag down the overworked server to get a beer (Sapporo) to the table. The appetizers came out in a reasonable amount of time. My mom and I split the calamari which was unremarkable, don't bother ordering this one. My dad had the pumpkin soup which he said was excellent.

After our appetizers we waited for a long time to get our meals. Too long. I went with the red curry. There was a healthy amount of chicken in the dish which was great to see. Unfortunately the dish as a whole was mediocre. I get better curry at the fast-food place by my office. There wasn't really anything wrong with it, a good three stars, it just wasn't anything above and beyond.

After our food arrived we never saw our sever again until about 15 minutes after we had finished eating. We felt that we had been forgotten about when he came back to the table to see if we wanted anything else. We just got the bill, paid, and left.

If this place is going to survive they need to sort out the roles for their service staff. The food is good enough, but I shudder at coming back because of the poor service."}
{"text":"Our family of seven went on a quiet Sunday evening.  I was worried that we might be getting the dregs of leftovers, but all our food was cooked fresh.  Wonderful aromas of garlic, spice and ginger were wafting from our plates.  The food was excellent and the service impeccable.  The prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Amazing. Excellent prices. I always get free soup or small salad when I ordered entree. Upscale relaxed atmosphere. I came back again twice while staying at hotel on business trip."}
