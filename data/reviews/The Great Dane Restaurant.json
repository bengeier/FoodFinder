{"text":"This place is the best....Great lunch specials and home made egg salad and sides.
The highlight of the visit is Maria and Nancy, they could not be more friendly, their smile will surely brighten your day."}
{"text":"This place is just great! I mean I usually get the Fire dog but their bratwurst's are good along with the polish sausage. If you are in the mood for a down right good hot dog, this is the place to be. If you want something a little more, they have different variations with all the proper Chicago style fixings. I hear that the Italian Beef sandwich is really good too. The owners are beyond friendly and the prices are totally reasonable. I also think the exterior is pretty cool!!

Definitely worth stopping in and grabbing a dog and a soda with crushed ice!!"}
{"text":"A real trip - back in time! The \"old world\" alpine chalet decor is honest enough to be cute in it's cheesy-ness, especially with the addition of the heavily-accented (Danish, I assume) ladies behind the counter. 
The dogs are excellent. A sign says you must request that your dog be grilled (I assumed that meant your dog is boiled otherwise), but I made no such request and my Jumbo came out perfectly grilled with just the right amount of crispiness on the outside, juiciness on the inside. The tuna salad-stuffed tomato was also tasty as was the potato salad. Nothing cut tinge edge or creative here - just good, solid, traditional tastiness."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD! Prices are good too and the atmosphere is good. I come here multiple times a week to grab lunch for me and my co-workers considering its in walking distance. We also always suggest eating here to anyone who comes in our store and needs to kill some time in the area. 

Everything is made fresh but is still pretty quick. 

Small and family owned and always has people in there so they must be doing something right!!! Would always keep them in mind if your in the area and need good cheap quick food!!"}
{"text":"Solid, fresh made to order Hot dogs. 
I'm a weekly diner at Dane's. $4.50 gets you a dog and choice of side. Fries, tater salad, potato chips. 
It's a simple little place, cooking their hot dogs hot and fresh. I love to support the little guys, and when they provide a serious, consistent product, that makes me like them even more. 
Recommended to anyone in the area who wants a hot dog, bratwurst or chili dog."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just want a hot dog, and Great Dane's is the perfect place for a hot dog fix.  The interior leaves much to be desired, but hey, it has been there since 1975!  The prices are cheap, the daily special is usually 2 hot dogs, fries and a drink for $5!  I like the dogs, they are Vienna Beef, but I do wish they were a bit thicker like the Costco dogs, but I did enjoy the poppy seed buns and traditional Chicago style fixings!"}
{"text":"Spectacular!
Great comfortable environment and delicious inexpensive food.  If you love hot dogs this is your place.  They have lots of variety but don't go overboard and mess up a simple delicious hot dog.  One thing i can never forget about this place is the soda.  Sounds peculiar I know but they mix it perfectly and shave the ice into almost powder mmmmmm.  Very nice owners who run a great business so if you like supporting local business im sure thy could use your business.   Only open for lunch but definintely beats stealing coworkers leftovers from the work fridge. I hear not so great things about their burgers but i go there for the hot dogs so I've never had that problem.  Highly Reccomended!

Recommend: footlong"}
{"text":"Ordered the tuna sandwich for lunch with a side of potato salad. Both tasted really fresh."}
{"text":"Mr. Hottie and I ventured over here today to check it out. Talk about a diet deviation!  I was a little nervous to disappoint him as he's from Illinois and Great Dane's claims to serve Chicago Style Dogs. I took a deep breath and went inside.

Great Dane's is an older building that could be designated as a charming little hole in the wall. The inside is covered with pictures of dogs, those you eat and those you pet. 

We went to the counter to order and were greeted warmly. The girl behind the counter was friendly and explained what the various types of dogs were. Mr. Hottie chose 2 Chicago Style dogs (Great Danes) and I chose the Hound Dog (a larger hot dog) with cheese, chili and sauerkraut (hey... don't knock it until you try it). All the dogs come with your choice of fries or coleslaw.

We grabbed a small table and waited for our order. It wasn't long before our food was brought to our table. My hot dog was delicious. The meat was all Vienna Beef and it wasn't at all greasy or mushy. My hot dog was actually \"meaty\" if you will. Mr. Hottie's dogs were good! (Sigh of relief). He said the same thing about his dog. A few observations he had was that he wished that they added more Sports peppers on the dog. It only came with one on each dog. He also wished for more tomato. The dogs automatically came with sauerkraut which, I learned, is not usually on a traditional Chicago dog unless you ask for it. 

Overall, we liked Great Dane's. It's a little old gem and I'm sure we'll visit it again whenever we're feeling naughty and craving wieners! HOT DOGS YOU PERVS! Go check it out. You'll see what I mean."}
{"text":"This place has been here since 1978ish - pretty sure it's all original decor from day one and that's what makes it unique- food is always good and the iced tea is excellent. The gals that work there are wonderful."}
{"text":"I've been going to this fine establishment since the mid-90's. The owners and staff are very friendly and they always know what I'm going to get. In the past I've stuck mainly to the footlong, great dane or the jumbo dog.  Now my regular is the lunch special with 2 dogs, fries and a drink. The fixin's are the perfect amount and the restaurant is old school, which I like quite a bit. I've had great memories in this place, and hope others give it a shot."}
{"text":"NOT IMPRESSED! I had a ham & cheese sandwich.  Easy right?  Nah! I think they put Italian dressing on accident and then tried to wipe it off, thinking I wouldn't notice.  Talk about ruining a good sandwich!  What a disappointment!  I used to go here for years when I was a kid. Not like it used to be...or maybe it was a lazy staff in the back.  Could have just gotten some new bread & new meat."}
{"text":"There is nothing special about this place. First of all, the girl working the counter was more interested in having a conversation with her girlfriend that was there waiting on food. The conversation was totally inappropriate and forced us to eat outside. They only have a few hot dogs to choose from and there's nothing special about them. My boyfriend ordered the coney cheese dog and they served him a short fat dog with cheese sauce all over the bun and a side of watery meat sauce. It looked terrible and they ended up remaking it with the appropriate dog and the meat and cheese in the bun rather than all on the outside of it. I had higher expectations from this place and will not be going back, ever."}
{"text":"Excellent little lunch spot. Very good Chicago dogs and superb beef combo sandwich. It's an Italian beef sandwich with an Italian sausage on the bottom. I enjoy it very much.
They also usually have nice lunch specials as well. Like today for example the special was 2 hotdogs with French fries or chips and a 16oz drink for 5.99$ very reasonable for quality beef hot dogs with a proper hotdog bun. Everything is always made fresh so you can always call in your order ahead of time if you don't want to wait. All in all its a fun clean friendly place give them a try."}
{"text":"Good hole in the wall place.  Friendly staff and clean surroundings.  Excellent chili dogs.  Would come back to support local business.  Really wished they offered Coke products, but I have no control over that...not a deal breaker."}
{"text":"Good but not great would be the way to sum up my experiences at Great Dane's.

Yes, they serve Chicago style, genuine Vienna Beef hotdogs, but despite what anyone claims, these are not rare and can be found almost everywhere. Plus, despite the fact that they may be \"Chicago\" style, they are kind of wimpy little dogs.

Unlike others, I've never had an issue with the service here, so they get credit for that.

But mostly, it's just the dated atmosphere that drives me batty. The building itself is built in that faux-Danish style that was popular in the 60's and 70's and this place feels like it hasn't been updated since. From the wood benches to the lousy AM radio station playing in the background, it feels like you've entered a time warp. In fact, if you wanted to turn this into a bar, it could be the Regal Beagle from Three's Company. 

What I'd love to see would be the owners either embracing the retro theme and including it in the menu, decorations, or overall atmosphere or just partnering up with local schools and becoming the hangout for junior high and high school kids in the area, like one of those classic malt shops or diners you see in TV shows.

For now though it's a decent place to get a hot dog, but nothing all that great."}
{"text":"I just moved here from Seattle and wanted to have a hotdog.  I saw this place one night when it was close and we decided to go back the next day when they opened.

The menu was intimadating at first, so I had to ask the girl what was what.  I ordered the quarter pound.  Yummy!  BF ordered the Reuben, which looked really good with the cheese sauce on it.

We will be back"}
{"text":"This is one cheap owner. Now he has downsized the soda, and raised the prices. He will eventually save himself out if a business. Poor value, ok quality."}
{"text":"Great Dane  is a Chicago styled mom and pop hot dog and burger joint.  They have a 5 dollar special that they update.  I had the chili dog with fries.  It came out to about 6 bucks with a tip.  It was good and what I was expecting.  Not mind blowing or anything creative or to write home about but still a solid chili dog.  The fries were also average.  Everything was made to order which is always nice.  I would go back and try something else if I was in the area."}
{"text":"The epitome of a classic \"Mom and Pop\" place. Great food and great prices! 
They have awesome Foot Long Hot Dogs!"}
{"text":"Great food great specials great service. The Italian beef is awesome and so is the fish sandwich"}
{"text":"Just happened to be on a Hot Dog marathon with my Dad from the Chicago area and had to check these guys out. Thanks to Bonnie E. for trying them out earlier and giving me the top secret thumbs up.

This is a really cool Mom and Pop restaurant that is located in an old building from the fifties. The owners are really nice and shared some of the long standing history of this joint as well as providing a unique and interesting atmosphere inside.

The menu here is very simple and has several of the hole in the wall favorites. Three different size Hot Dogs that can be dressed up in several ways. Cheese Burgers, Chicken Sandwiches, Italian Beef and Italian Sausage are just a few other choices. They even had a Fish and Chips special on our last trip.

Ordered a Chili Cheese Dog and a couple of Chi Dogs for yours truly. Had to get some Onion Rings to see if they were legit. My Dad went with a Jumbo Chicago Dog special which comes with a side and a drink.

Everything was very good and we both admitted that we would definitely come back again. Looking forward to trying out more of their other items and just kicking back and enjoying the laid back vibe. They even have an old AM radio cranking out some oldies in the background. Nice!

This is one of those places that is not brand spanking new with tons of flashing lights and TV's everywhere. Matter of fact, it reminded us both of going back in time and feeling like we were living happy moments from a past life.

Service is very friendly and the place is very clean and tidy. Food is cooked to order and there can be a small wait. Just kick back and enjoy the ride. Your foot will probably start tapping a tune. Radio just happened to be playing some Partridge Family when we were there. I THINK I LOVE YOU .... !!!

{"text":"I enjoyed this place.  It's a throwback to places you might have eaten at as a kid.

I got the lunch special which is 2 hot dogs, fries, and a drink for $5.99 ($6.55 inc. tax).  The dogs were great with the fixings.  The fries are the shoestring kind (not thick cut steak fries) which is what I like.  The food is served in a basket and the ketchup comes out of the old school squeeze bottles.

I was in and out in less than 20 minutes and spent less than $7.  Nice place to pop into if you want to go old school for a change."}
{"text":"This joint has it all. Footlongs that can fill you up or the daily special that covers all the bases. Rare to find a great place like this still alive in our mass produced chain days, but it's real hometown dogs at a great price. Try the special with fry's and go from there! 

I'm a member of an exclusive Hot Dog club and we visit great establishments every month. This has just been selected as our home restaurant and so for what it's worth, Coney Connoisseurs have rated this place very high."}
{"text":"Nothing special, to be honest.  I am a huge supporter of small business owners. Sadly, Sonic has better tasting hotdogs and buns. Also his lemonade offered with special (says machine is broken, awaiting repair) is disgusting, watered down. Sadly, after all these years driving by... I know why I have not ever stopped in....and never will again.  :/"}
{"text":"Great food, made to order with many choices. Love this central PHX favorite. Hate that it makes you add extra text to post. This is a great little place clean and yummy."}
{"text":"The Hot Dogs are delicious and prices are reasonable.  

I love their daily lunch special 2 Hot Dogs, Fries & Drink for $5 !"}
{"text":"I have actually never walked in the place, but my family, we all get take out there.  The potato salad is as if my sister in law made it, the only one that compares to hers, taste homemade.  It's a little heavy on the mayo, sometimes, but the flavor is amazing.  
I am mostly vegetarian, so I order that and the cole slaw, and am going to try the stuffed tomato with tuna.  (I occasionally eat certain kinds of fish.)
My sons get the dogs, which I tasted once, omg, the flavor (I'm from Chicago,) was much better than Portillo's. That's saying a lot.
Now, as far as criticism, i appreciate that they have \"soup of the day,\" since I love soup, but every single time I checked, it was the Split pea soup, which I love, but I ordered it once, and the texture was bad, and it was so flavorless, I could not eat more than a bite or two of it, waste of money. ($3.95) for one of those round cartons.
It would be quicker for me to drive down 12th street to Indian School and hang a left one block and go to that  Chicago style hotdog place (the guy is actually not from Chicago, and was very rude to us btw,) but, I don't like the food as much, and don't eat meat often anymore, and there are no vegetarian options, or fish, or soup, etc.  
  This just taste a little less like a restaurant take food, and a little more like home made fresh food, seems to have less salt, etc.  Hope this helps.
by the way, why not offer a \"smart dog,\" vegetarian dog or veggie burger, for those of us who need that?  You can sigh up on the app for Happy Cow, and get some free advertising that way, out in your neck of the woods there, near the \"art district,\" I think it would fly maybe.  Just saying.  
Oh, last but not least, they do have a fish sandwich, I don't know if it's all the time, it's cod though, and I don't eat that."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm visiting Phoenix from Southern California I always make a stop and get the lunch special!!! Two dogs,fries and a drink for around 6 bucks.  The dogs can be steamed or grilled depending on your preferences.  Usually I get kraut and mustard.  The photos are a good representation if you decide to do a dog with everything!  There menu also consists of a variety of other food items, burgers, sandwiches, salads.  I've never eaten anything besides the dogs, so I cannot comment on the other items.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.  If you go in at lunchtime expect to wait because it's very busy, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I live within walking distance and find myself here a couple times a month! I keep my hot dog basic (ketchup & red onion) but the chili dog is good, too. Yummy French fries."}
{"text":"I am not a hot dog connoisseur. I'll be honest. I mostly dislike hot dogs.

Growing up, our family tradition was to eat a hot dog on New Year's day. My mom (and grandmother before that) would say you'd be guaranteed to have money in your pocket year round (and that every meal after would be sure to be better). I ranked this \"tradition\" right up there with the mandatory liver and onions dinner once a year. 

Well, I must confess: since Dottsy Z. introduced me to Great Dane's I have craved and enjoyed a chili dog on my own volition on more than one occasion. 

The soft poppy seed bun provides a pillowy home for a the steamed dog (which could be grilled upon request) that offers a nice mild flavor with the famous snap. The chili is an excellent compliment providing a nice additional texture. All a this and yummy skinny fries for under $5? At that rate, I really do have a shot at money in my pocket all year!

So, my hat is off to Great Dane's for doing what my mother and grandmother were never able to do: eat a hot dog and enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Look, I'm not from Chicago but I try to get CHI dogs anywhere I can. The Great Dane is an excellent offering when you are in Uptown Phoenix. The service has always been friendly and the food right on the mark."}
{"text":"Wanted a hot dog before heading out to a Spring Training game.  We refuse to go to Chicago Hamburger Company even though it is close to our house so headed here after a bit of a  search.  Husband's hot dog was good & my polish dog was good.  Came back a week later because I remember seeing  a pastrami sandwich on the menu.  OMG - the pastrami was great!  Potato salad is also a hit.  Husband got a Chicago dog this time.  Less than $12.00 for my pastrami & his Chicago dog and drink and the food was good.  They also open at 10:00 for those of us that have early lunches.  There are also quite a few other things on the menu that I would like to try if I can bring myself to not order that wonderful pastrami sandwich.  Menu has a good variety and the staff was also friendly both times we were in."}
{"text":"My daughter and I have been coming here for many years....she turned me on to the place...and it's the best I've had!    Even better than Ted's!
      They'll do any dog or sandwich any way you want it....you want more pickles?  They'll do it!   And the buns are super, too!
      We're heading out this weekend to celebrate her birthday.  Great Dane's is the fare of the day!    Happy Birthday, Mimi!"}
{"text":"A reviewer stated their dogs are not big enough, however they offer three sizes, and I found the regular size to be sufficient.  
These dogs rock.  They are so tasty, And the toppings are extremely good as well.  The restaurant might seem a little ghetto but it is well worth going to."}
{"text":"Since this place is set up rather simpke, I'll make my review the same. Good deal for the money for dogs, beef, burger or, sausage.  The don't over do it with the toppings so enjoy it all.."}
{"text":"Such an unassuming little spot, the jumbo Chicago dog is excellent! Seems like a family owned operation which I totally dig, and the lady at the counter is as sweet as could be. Super glad I skipped the trendy place down the street in favor of grabbing lunch here!"}
{"text":"I have been ordering the #7 (chili dog) with fries and an ice tea for nearly 15 years from The Great Dane. 

I love this place! The owners are so great and friendly.

The food is simple, but I love it. 

This is a small establishment and at times can be kind of crowded and other times there isn't but one customer."}
{"text":"Five stars based on the menu items I had. I had the bulldog and potato salad. Hot dog was was perfectly cooked (snappy casing provides a nice texture) on a soft yummy fresh bun. Relish was fantastic and I have to give special props to their thin little pickle spears. If you like pickles, ask for extra! Husband had the brat and said it was great.

The potato salad is the old-fashioned mayo kind like mom used to make. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. They have a pretty big menu so I am excited to try their other items."}
{"text":"A cheesedog and chili dog, just good enough to fill an empty stomach. Somehow it was just average but definitely good stuff."}
{"text":"There's just something special about this place. It's been a fixture on 7th St for many years. It's not at all updated inside, but that is no bother at all. It's like stepping into a different time.

All the food is made to order, so it's hot and fresh. The Bulldog hotdog is the bomb! All sandwiches and hotdogs come with a side, so you get a ton of food without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about 15-20 years.  I used to alternate between here and Mr. Mort's until Mr. Mort died.  Now I eat all my hot dogs here.  Hildy is just the best.  The dogs are authentic (and I am from Chicago).  My health concious kids will only eat the turkey sandwiches which are not bad.  I've had the Italian beef several times and it is excellent.  The fries are cooked just right.    My only criticism would be that the drinks are loaded with crushed ice.  I think you can get free refills but I have always been too embarrassed to ask.  The outdoor seating (3 tables) is dog friendly too!"}
{"text":"Time warp to the 70's. I feel like a kid in this place. Quality dogs, fries, and drinks for cheap here. The lunch special is my go-to. 2 dogs, fries and a soda for 6 bucks. Sit back, relax, take in the amazing old-school wood interior, and enjoy your meal amongst the sun-faded pictures of dogs on the walls. No TV's and Arizona Gold oldies radio is always playing. Thanks for keeping it real, Great Dane."}
{"text":"Was looking for a quick place to get lunch while out of town. Looked up hot dogs and this was one of the first places to come up with good reviews. I'm glad the wife and i decided to try it out! I got the daily special of two hot dogs, fries and a drink. They were delicious, generally i dont care for seeds on my bun but it didn't detract here. It comes with a bunch of toppings like onions,relish,pickle wedge and other stuff u can pick i got everything minus sauerkraut. My wife got the other daily special which was the italian sausage sandwich both were $5.99 a piece. It was good but they could have cut the sausage in slices instead of cutting it in half length wise. the casing makes it difficult to eat. That's the only real negative on the food. The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is it was hot in there! Not a fan of eating somewhere thats as hot as my food. Overall nice place friendly staff and food cooked to order. We highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Closed?????

NOOOOOOOOOOOOO...........

How? Why? 

Crap.

Probably going to be back filled with one of the \"flash in the pan\" POS venues that are proliferating in the area and will be closed in 15 months........

The neighborhood/city can only support just so many restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Terrific prices and everything and more you would expect from a Vienna beef hotdog joint.  The owner and his wife a very sweet people, with a slight European accent but I have not asked what country they were originally from.  I am sure it was one with a passion for sausage, guessing Austria.  Anyway they do their dogs very well, great fries, everything comes with a side of your choice, cole slaw, potato salad, chips, fries, and more.  Hot dogs are constructed just like they should be and have that authentic taste, unlike those other chain reasturants that claim to serve Vienna beef, those chain Chicago style eateries with amazing decor and piss poor food, you know the ones.  This is an authentic unpretentious joint that deserves your business.  Great to take the kids to and like I said the prices are very fair, a great high quality low cost lunch is what to expect."}
{"text":"It's one of those days- wandering aimlessly looking for a simple quick lunch that's not \"fast food\". Spotted this little place as I drove by and thought I'd give it a try. Went simple since this is my first time and got the 2 hotdog special. They were really good. So were the fries that came with. Staff are really nice. I will come back to try their other dogs!"}

By far a Great dog an usually great meal deals, and will make any excuse to stop in and sit a spell.

{"text":"Great Dane has a good hot dog. nothing super fantastic but when your craving a hot dog and are in this neighborhood this is a good place to stop.

prices are a little meh, and the fries were so so.
i got the reuben hotdog and it was tasty...except for the cheeze wiz in it. i don't remember that being in a Reuben sandwich. otherwise it was a good dog.
