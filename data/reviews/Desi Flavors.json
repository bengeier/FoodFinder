{"text":"Awesome service. I catered for 20 people today and although they were closed they took my order and delivered to my door right on time. food was great, I had asked for extra meat on the veal pulao and was not disappointed. Chicken Karahi and the Tandoori naan was phenomenal. Thanks Desi flavors."}
{"text":"Good food at a reasonable price. The butter chicken could have used a bit more protein (I didn't count how many pieces but it didn't seem as abundant as other places). The samosas and pakoras are a little on the greasy side but I like it that way so no complaints here!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. Did delivery, and did not do any of the \"BBQ\" type dishes. Naan was actually just pitas, not true Naan, and the paneer had only 3 pieces of cheese. The rest was ok, with the highlights being the veggies and the biryani."}
{"text":"Seekh kababs not even made on site, they buy frozen, boxed seekh kabaabs from an indian grocery store and then nuke them and serve them.  The quality of the rest of the food was awful.  Go here if you want really bad food for very cheap, the prices are very cheap but alas, you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Good food and great quality. I tried its Biryani and kabobs, both items were delicious. Their kabobs are hot and fresh. I dont like beef kabobs so I ordered chicken seekh kabobs and they were very tasty."}
{"text":"Food quality has improved since I was there last.  Very delicious but the wait for take out was at least 45 minutes. The place is so poorly organized with orders I think it's just best to call your order in ahead of time.  No wait and no chaos. I do like the newly renovated eat in section but arrive before the rush periods because the food is very popular!"}
{"text":"Visited this place 2 times in 2 days, that's how good the food is. Small little restaurant which is sometimes hard to miss but I'm glad I found it."}
{"text":"Chicken Biryani special at  $3.99 each.  Tastes much better then Biryani King and all of the other biryani places I've tried in Brampton.  Very reasonable prices for catering as well. The owner Ali and his wife are very friendly people and will go out of their way to accommodate you. They recently moved here from the Bronx and love the quiet Canadian life in comparison. Although they are situated right next to a local Keltic bar and they get some crazy customers every once in a while, they love doing what they do and put their heart and soul into their restaurant.  Take-out only. No option to dine in."}
