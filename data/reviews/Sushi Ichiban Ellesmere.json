{"text":"We drive 20 km  in GTA traffic to go eat Sushi at this place - probably driving by at least 20 other sushi places. The quaility, selection and freshness of the sushi is really awesome. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The establishment is small, but clean and welcoming.   My wife and I recently found out about this sushi restaurant a couple months ago. After our first visit, we have come back approximately five to six times.  The food is very fresh and the portions are excellent. Among the different rolls, my favourite is the valentine roll due to its' unique contrast between crispy and spicy ingredients.    Service is very fast and the prices are competitive. If you order three specialty rolls, be prepared to spend $40 (after tax and tip). However compared to other fast food establishment, the ingredients are very top notch and a lot more nutritious. Also, compared to a wide range of other is sushi establishments in the GTA, this location produces excellent food."}
{"text":"Love this place.  It is my go to for special roll platters. :). They look fabulous and taste great too. I recently ordered their special roll combo, as well as, their large sashimi combo. The Special Roll combo has 10 special rolls that you can choose yourself and their rolls are relish. :). Great value as well. :) The large Sashimi combo was also amazingly presented and had very good quality choices for sashimi.  Great value too. I ordered these for a birthday party of 10 people (adults) with some other finger foods and everyone was very happy and full.  All really enjoyed the choices of rolls and had a wonderful time. The service was great and everything was ready to pick up on time when we got there."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and it was awesome! Everything was really fresh and it was reasonably priced. We had the mango roll (which is a chef special and was really yummy) and the sushi roll combo with Cali, dynamite and spicy salmon rolls. The service was really good and our food came fast. I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Love it. Clean, great taste and amazing service. The only sushi place with the owner and staff very friendly."}
{"text":"This place is tucked in a corner across from staples.  Went on a monday night, though I did not have trouble finding parking spots spaces seem to be very limited here.  As for the restaurant it is very cozy atmosphere and the service was very prompt and the waitress came several times to ask how we are doing and refilled our tea without requesting it.    The food itself was amazing for what you pay for.  We ordered a medium sushi boat which was plentiful for a party of 2. It came with a different variety of sushi and sashimi and they were very fresh. Also note that this does not come with a complimentary salad like most other Japanese restaurants.  Would love to give this 4 stars but just as I was about to leave however, we saw a HUGE bug that was crawling across the wall which questions the cleanliness of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the corner of a small strip mall, Sushi Ichiban Ellesmere is your average sushi joint in Scarborough.  Stopped in for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. It was our first time here.  There was a grand opening/under new management/newly renovated sign out front - not sure how recent it is. The atmosphere is good and decor is great. Staff were attentive and friendly. Seemed to have a constant flow of customers for a small place. No wait time though (at least when we were there).   There was a good selection on the menu. We were presently surprised that the lunch specials were not just for the weekdays (that's always a plus!). Having said that, we ordered a sashimi bento ($10.95) and salmon teriyaki bento ($11.95) from the lunch specials. We also ordered jap chae ($9.95) and spicy salmon/dynamite roll combo ($11.95). We also tried to order some toro but unfortunately they did not have any. Oh well, that was a bit much for two people anyway. Everything was presented nicely. The quality was ok and flavours were good. Nothing too over the top that needs mentioning. If you're looking for a quick fix to satisfy a craving and you're in the area, this could be the place."}
{"text":"Used to love this place but the new owner is horrible. Purchased take out and the owner was extremely rude. He wouldn't give any extra soy sauce, over charged on every item. (Items that ended in 95 cents were rounded to the nearest dollar...), charged me on an item that I didn't order and only noticed until after. Food was okay but with that service and horrible experience I will never go back with other great options nearby."}
{"text":"found this little, clean, newly renovated sushi place in Scarborough. ordered a medium sashimi boat (50pc). freshest sashmi you can find in Scarborough. beautifully presented. came with miso soup. head chef  gave us two extra pieces of uni. yumyum~~~ also ordered a sushi roll but rice was a bit dry.  will definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch, it was awesome, the only thing that may be 4/5 is the tempura batter could be more \"fluffy\". The service is great and the food came quickly. They promptly serve you tea as well. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing sushi place! We go here all the time for lunch and dinner. Nicest owners and sincere. It is a hidden gem. One of the best sushi places in the Toronto. I've never had shrimp tempera this good. The maki rolls are prepared just right. Not overly stuffed and correct size. If you know your sushi the price is a bargain considering the quality of the fish. A great review because I'm being honest."}
{"text":"The food was okay... service was good. I ordered Dragon Roll and my husband ordered Bulgogi Dinner. The portion was small. I felt I could have another two plates of dragon roll but I couldn't afford to."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out after the high yelp reviews. We ordered their \"medium assorted\" option with sashimi, rolls, and sushi and it was delicious. Everything was super fresh.   I originally wrote this post after finishing the main course with the intention of giving it a 5 start rating while waiting for my dessert. After the dessert came, that changed.   I ordered the green tea ice cream and when it came I was so excited for 2 huge scoops of ice cream. But when I turned it around I noticed that it was just an outline of a scoop and that it was basically hollow inside. The way they scooped the ice cream made it look bigger than it seemed. Pictures have been uploaded. This incident really upset me and unfortunately has left me with a negative memory of this restaurant. Would I come again...? Maybe. But for now, I have to leave this place with a 3 star review."}
{"text":"Small joint, located in an ethnicaly diverse   plaza  that includes Filipino and Middle   Eastern food shops. Always friendly  and prompt service. Seems to have a lot of regulars coming for pick-up orders. Consistently  good quality food at a fair price."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food! Beautiful restaurant, nice ambiance. All around great experience."}
{"text":"It's 3.5.  We had:  Bulgogi dinner($15.95): Comes with miso soup and salad. Sliced beef bulgogi on a sizzling plate.  Comes with rice.  This was okay.  Nothing special. Rating: 3/5  Chirashi Sushi ($14.95):  Comes with miso soup. Close to 20 pieces of assorted sashimi on bed of rice.  About 5-6 pieces of salmon, 2 pieces of white tuna, 2 pieces maguro, 2 pieces of red snapper, 2 pieces of tamago, 2 pieces of albacore tuna, 1 piece of unagi, 1 piece of surfclam, 1 piece of squid.  Very good sashimi and very good value for the price. Rating:4/5   Will return for the sashimi and sushi."}
{"text":"The sushi was really good. Fish was really fresh. Everybody was polite, excellent service. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This place is way over priced. I know it's unfair to expect downtown prices but really? Yam roll for $9.00?"}
{"text":"From the smell and decor when we walked in to the service and delicious food it was a great experience. Would definitely come back. Check it out :)"}
{"text":"New owners, new restaurant and new menu!!!!! Chefs/staff are very nice, renovation is beautiful and comfortable. Quality and taste of the food is amazing and very inexpensive. Highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I got take out from here but we were surprised to see that the whole concept of the previous restaurant was changed. It looks much better but we were going to be dining at home.  We ordered the small sashimi combo which was about 24 pieces that came up to be around ~27 dollars.   The fish was fresh, but the portions were incredibly small. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"So fresh, so good and hit the spot. The lunch comes with salad, soup and a mixture of rolls if you wish. All were great esp the spicy salmon. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little sushi place. Very clean, excellent service, and the food was great. This was our first time but it won't be our last, it's code to home so unite convenient"}
{"text":"So glad I found out about this place on Yelp! Clean, cute and friendly this little place is. The rolls are so fresh and good. It was my first time here and we got take out. They were also very friendly. Will definitely be back to dine in next time."}
{"text":"After the experience I had back in August, I needed some time to cool down. My opinion of the service hasn't changed since then. I had made Saturday reservations for my boyfriend's birthday during the week. The place was small but clean. Definitely not overcrowded during rush hour. The food was mediocre but priced on the high end as a few people have stated. I went in of course based on the more positive reviews on Yelp. The waitress was friendly and the service was prompt for the duration of the meal. In total I paid about $88 for the meal including tip. After the meal I thought to use prepaid Visa and credit. The lady cashing me out told me the prepaid Visa was declined when it had gone through. A full $37 had been charged and I was charged $88 on top. Easy enough mistake to reverse. I noticed on the online Visa statement that I had been over charged. I called the restaurant and they told me to come in. They had thrown away the receipt of what they thought was a voided transaction. Normally you give voided receipts to the customer but I figured I still had my statement as proof. I went in the following Saturday to show the statement to get my refund but was met with a lot of resistance. The owner took it to extremes by accusing me of fraud despite having proof of the overpayment. I had never been to this restaurant prior to the one day my boyfriend and I ate there but he told me he was good with \"faces\" and had seen me there before doing the exact same thing. I was flabbergasted. No one has ever accused me of fraud under any circumstances. And especially not after paying $88 for a meal. Needless to say the owner relented and gave me back my money, but this is not a place I would feel comfortable visiting again. The whole experience was bizarre to say the least. I received absolutely no apology from the owner for the accusation of fraud despite getting my money back. Worst service experience of my life."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi & service always! Been coming here for a long time!! Even my 6 yr old loves it!"}
{"text":"Service is still as lovely as ever - I would come here just for that alone. Everyone was just so sweet and the atmosphere definitely had that wonderful intimate and homely feel to it. Pretty standard in terms of taste and price point, but nothing to complain about either! :)"}
{"text":"Went in with a couple of coworkers today for lunch and here are the things I've noticed about my trip.  Service was good considering there was only one other table.   Food.... I have a problem with. I got a lunch roll combo and I was really really disappointed with the quality. The rice was really hard... Like I got it at the end of day sale from a grocery store.... I had to really chew and it just felt dry and hard. Really sad.  The miso soup doesn't have tofu or seaweed in it which I found kind of strange and sad. Maybe that's common? Strange to me though.  Salad dressing was dry and not flavorful. It kinda forms into a ball lol, not a fan personally.  Now price, it's not cheap, and for the quality, I don't think it's good enough. The value is also not too great, I was hungry after that lunch special and that never happens with me... I wonder why... Lol maybe portions are just smaller?  Personally I wouldn't come back here again, the above things are things I don't like from my food but again, this is my opinion. Maybe they cater better to others. I'm pretty spoiled by high quality and value sushi up in Richmond hill so maybe this just couldn't compare.   Sorry didn't get any pictures, was too hungry to wait!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal!!!!!!!!!! Service hands down the best. They are so friendly and soooooo nice. Food was great."}
{"text":"The rolls I got were delicious! (Spicy tuna, crispy crunch, firecracker, valentine). They were warm and packed with flavour. There were 3 of us women sharing this plate and it was enough! I'm planning on  coming back here to try all the items with a heart on it, as well as the Korean dishes!"}
{"text":"I'm finding it increasingly difficult to find a good Japanese restaurant in this area. We decided to give this place a try when our sushi craving hit and honestly, it was NOT great. We got the sushi and roll combo (small B) for $31.95 for the two of us. The quality was equivalent to that of an all-you-can-eat sushi meal. I want to say a little something was missing, but it felt like a lot of something was missing. Maybe it was freshness or quality of ingredients, but there was definitely a lack of flavour.   We will not be returning here as it truly fell flat of the average Japanese restaurant standards."}
{"text":"Nice friendly service Food is pretty average Prices are average  Parking can be a nightmare in the plaza but it's not too bad  Overall, it's alright"}
{"text":"I liked this place - the hussle of a business owner that cares what customers think and feel is important to me.  Stopped by this place for a quick lunch bite and although service was a little slow, the quality of the sushi made up for it.   we were served by the owner/chef and he answered all the questions we had and made two delicious recommendations. the fish was very fresh and the sushi was very flavourful.   it was decently priced and very nice and clean from the inside - which surprised me because of the location.   definitely would come by again, if in the area."}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant but seems to be popular. We went there for dinner on Sunday night. The restaurant was almost full but we got a table for 2 right away. We ordered 4 rolls (3 special rolls and 1 basic rolls),1 seaweed salad and 1 Ichiban sashimi. The sundae/Sunday rolls is my favorite, taste really good. Special dragon rolls and valentine rolls are good too. California rolls are just so so. The Itchiban sashimi is assorted and 15 pieces in total. We paid $88 after tax and tips. The price is more than I expected.Yelp shows $$ of this place but actually I will say it's a $$$ place. But overall it's worth try and food is fresh."}
{"text":"Wow, what a find. This restaurant has the best miso soup I have ever tasted. My partner and I came here for dinner and we were both blown away. We both eat a lot of sashimi and the fish here was beautiful and fresh. We also tried the crispy crunch roll, It was excellent. The service was quick and friendly, great customer service skills. We will be back, soon."}
{"text":"Food 8.5/10, Atmosphere 9/10, Service 9/10 (I went there on November 14, 2015) (Went again September 2016, still amazing)  One Word Conclusion: Fresh sushi, relatively affordable, wonderful ambience.   The food was so yummy. Another friend and I each got the sushi lunch special, while another friend got the veggie tempura set. The tempura was HUGE, and the sushi I had was fresh and really yummy.   Atmosphere was nice - it was simple but very clean, with nice wood decor. I loved the sunlight pouring into the restaurant. It was also not too loud or noisy. I saw many people getting takeout.  Service: Nice, there was not much service but it felt enough. It wasn't intrusive, we had our tea filled when we needed it and I think the waitress was the husband of the sushi chef. They are both sweet and absolutely adorable, as they joke a bit with you and always have huge smiles on their faces. I wanted to bust out some of my Japanese polite usages, but was too shy. I'll work up the courage next time I go, and I'm sure there will be a next time! :) (edit: apparently they're Korean, lol! I overheard them speaking at my second visit and thought, ah. typical of sushi restaurants in Toronto)"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!! Come here often for the lunch special (roll combo--so fresh!) for $8. Also tried a few of the special rolls one night for dinner: Valentine Roll and Hurricane Roll, DE.LISH. Everything here is worth its value. The owner is kind and hardworking and his staff are excellent!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I always find ourselves calling Sushi Itchiban for pick up when we are either (Exhibit A) lazy to make dinner or (Exhibit B) just came back home from the gym & can eat like a beast w/ a lot of yummy protein! We would normally order a medium platter load of sashimi & some appetizers such as the gyoza, vegetable & shrimp tempura.  The food is just phenomenal and worth every penny. Never was a fan of other fish sashimi other than salmon but when i stepped outta the box & tried the variety of fish sashimi's here @ Sushi Itchiban...I was on a whole new different level & never want to just stick to eating salmon only! The gyoza's were nice and crunchy on the outside w/ the perfect amount of meat & veggies stuffed on the inside. The best part of our order was that we asked for our tempuras to be lightly battered....& they easily complied to our request. As a result, the tempuras were perfect! Most tempuras made @ other japanese restaurants have the batter over powering the shrimp, thus having such a batter overload !   Overall,This nice little gem is just walking distance from our home and glad we are now regulars to this nice and newly managed restaurant. I definitely would like to dine in one time during lunch rush to catch their awesome specials!"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty sushi. We got the crispy crunchy roll, the super dragon roll and some gyozas.  Gyoza were pretty simple and flavourful, and also perfectly crispy.   Both rolls were great, crunchy roll had lots of tempura on top which was a nice touch, and there was a generous portion of unagi with the super dragon roll."}
{"text":"The best Sushi in Maryvale for sure, if not all of Scarborough. Family run place,  the owners are super friendly and remember you by name. Freshest ingredients, great, clean atmosphere for a tiny place. We order take out at least three times a month!"}
{"text":"The best place we had for sushi... they are only a small place and pricey but still overall the sushi/sashimi loveboat combo was amazing, my husband & I finished the large loveboat."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Scarborough hands down.  Food is tasty and service is friendly and fast.  Great prices and great selection"}
{"text":"Cozy neighborhood Japanese/Korean restaurant with excellent service. The sashimi pieces were fresh and the tempura were super tasty. Other than the slightly undercooked sushi rice, the food was excellent. Fair prices and a delightful meal."}
{"text":"I didn't know about this hidden gem until a coworker suggested it. It is indeed fairly hidden since it's in a fairly crowded plaza and the place must only be about 15 feet wide.  I'm not going to break down every roll I've eaten here, but they make excellent sushi by having excellent quality, fresh sushi. They've also mastered having the proper size and portion ratio in their preparation. Hell, I was even impressed by how flavourful their avocado was.  I think the only things that was only average was the bulgogi I ordered once, which is a bit surprising since I'm fairly sure this place is Korean-run.  Great place, and no doubt I'll be back often as long as I'm working in this side of town."}
{"text":"I'll get straight to the point: the sushi rolls are very small, over priced and made poorly.  Like literally the tiniest little sushi bites I've ever had. If it was normal sized or if it was priced in relative to what they're giving you -it might have been decent."}
{"text":"It doesn't have to be \"high end\" to be a 5 out of 5. Family run place with great value and delicious rolls. The mango roll is proper. Hard working honourable people.   Room for improvement: young waiter could use a bit more savvy with customers and knowledge of food.   Food is fresh."}
{"text":"This place is Ah-mazing!! I have been looking for a Sushi place around me for quite some time and luckily my trusty Yelp app directed me here. I have eaten in and ordered take out from this place and both instances have been phenomenal!!! The freshness of the fish goes a long way and you can definitely tell that the Master Chef/Owner puts love into every dish be serves.  We ordered the salmon roll, seaweed salad, xmas roll, shrimp tempura, and sushi and roll combo and topped it off with Green Tea Matcha ice cream.  EVERYTHING TASTED DELICIOUS and the Salmon was melt in your mouth freshness!!!  The rolls are like Goldilocks sizes... jjjuuussttt right!!! Not too big or too small. The fish to rice ratio is perfect and I felt fill but not full of useless carbs.  The staff here are all very friendly and it does get busy on friday and saturday nights so make sure you call ahead for some reservations.... I am definitely coming back for more fresh and delicious Sushi!!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in a while.  Got the hurricane roll and fire cracker roll.  Both were excellent, melt in your mouth. The service was kind and readily available.  Came to ask if we wanted tea even after we were done and were just there chatting. We had two chef special rolls and a small sushi sashimi combo, came out to be $52 including tax.   Definitely coming back again to try more!"}
{"text":"As another reviewer said, not sure why the reviews are so high. But I must say that the staff is very friendly.   The food on the other hand is alright and in my opinion many other sushi places I would have preferred to go to. I got the sushi bento which was $10.95 which isn't bad for 10 pieces + salad and miso soup but the fish all tasted the same to me and it didn't have that good fresh fishy taste for the different fish.   Also got the crispy crunch roll which is essentially a California roll with the tempura bits and the smallest bit of spicy salmon which I to be honest couldn't even taste.   The biggest thing that bothered me was the rice. It didn't have enough water while cooking so it was slightly not as soft as I would have liked it and also didn't have enough rice vinegar."}
{"text":"I try the \"Unagi donburi\", the rice and ell fish, cook time so long, make the taste \"not soft\"...It taste horrible!"}
{"text":"For my first review I would like to give this place 5 stars. But while the price is comparable to other sushi houses (which do not offer AYCE) I wish it were a little cheaper so I could eat here often!  So I've lived in the neighbourhood for nearly a decade. I'm not sure how long this place has been around, but it's def been around for 5 years. How have I, sushi lover extraordinaire, never been here before??! (Edit: this place was newly renovated and opened a month ago. It may have change ownership. I am not sure ATM, however, there was a Sushi Ichiban in the same spot in the years prior to this review).  It's a pretty little restaurant. When I walked in to purchase lunch to go, there was one other customer having lunch inside. It could fit 15-20 inside. The menu is pretty extensive, in terms of special rolls. So it took me a few mins to get through it and decide. I ordered the Cottage roll, a chef recommended roll, and the Crunch Spicy Salmon roll. They also have lunch specials but I do enjoy special rolls more than California rolls. I despise California rolls!  It took 10 mins to make my rolls. I walked home with a warm container, which promptly cooled off due to high winds. But these rolls still taste delicious! Pricey, which is why AYCE is the way to go. However, if I've got a deep sushi craving and no time to hit up an AYCE spot, this seems like a wonderful sushi house to go to. It's also a lovely little place to go to for lunch with a couple of friends. I look forward to trying out more special rolls!!"}
{"text":"I had the cottage roll and a second roll I forget what it was. But the cottage roll was very delicious. I remember the second roll was very good too.   It's a nice small restaurant and there's practically no good sushi places in the area so I'm extremely glad I stumbled on this place.   I plan to return often. I found the staff nice and service was prompt."}
{"text":"Let's just say that Scarborough has a lot of hidden gems and this one was surely a great find. I was looking for a decent sushi resto close to home so I decided to check on Yelp and came across Ichiban which I know that it's normally a franchised own business. The one I previously go to at Yonge and Sheppard does not compare to Ichiban Ellesmere! I've tried this place two times so far: take out and dine in and both have exceeded my expecatations. The fish is just so FRESH. Apparently this restaurant has been revamped with renovations, new owner and new menu. The Master Chef who works here is a top sushi chef from The Thompson Hotel. He brings not only superb quality and freshness to the rolls but the presentation is stunning! At today's dining experience, we ordered seaweed salad, mixed tempura, katsu sushi (14 pcs), xmas roll, salmon roll, and topped it off with their matcha green tea ice cream. I was so impressed with the freshness of their fish. The salmon literally melted in my mouth and rolls were just bursting in flavour.   The service was top notch. It was pretty busy on a Sunday night as the restaurant was full only able to accommodate 20 patrons so we decided to sit at the bar which we didn't mind at all. The chefs were so busy and forgot to make our sushi and roll set (katsu sushi) but it was ok. Immediately the master chef apologized and whipped up the platter in less than 5 mins. He even handed the finishes plate to us mentioning that he gave us 2 extra rolls. Overall, great service. All the servers and chefs were friendly and attentive.  I highly recommend this place if you're in the Scarb area but make sure you make reservations on a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"A quaint little shop in the city. We dropped by this restaurant a little off our beaten path for an impromptu sushi date. At first note, the restaurant is clean and typical looking. The staff were notably friendly, service was quite fast. The menu sported many special rolls that were signature to the chef; the offerings were heavily Korean influenced. We decided we wanted a simple mix of sashimi, and rolls. We forfeited any decision making by ordering the medium Sashimi and roll platter.   The platter was beautifully presented. Shared between two dinners, it was sufficient enough to fill us up (with the last few pieces pushed and shoved around-using petty bargaining to clear up the plate). The sashimi definitely aimed to please. The pieces were fresh and nicely portioned; a good mix of oily and lean fish pieces...texturally, there weren't much diversity, but it was good no less. The disappointment came down to the rolls; we received a set of spicy salmon roll and a set of California roll. We weren't expecting much, but a dollop of sriracha on top the spicy mayo was not exactly palate pleasing.   To keep things short, great service, good sashimi, decent experience, and priced reasonably average. I would come back if there was nothing else to be had. I would be more inclined to try some of their special roll offerings and their sashimi platters."}
{"text":"So glad I discovered this sushi place again.  I had gone to it years ago and it was amazing but I stopped going to it and forgot all about it.  Decided to go to it for lunch one day, and the interior was very cozy and pretty relaxing. The food came promptly and the portion was perfect. There was a lot of sashimi in my chirashi, and the display of the food was perfect. The fish tasted fresh, and the wasabi was amazing.   I definitely would recommend this place for sushi lovers."}
{"text":"We visited this sushi place for many years prior to new management. Portions were good, very generous chefs (gave extra pieces every Christmas cause of wait times) and fresh fish. We recently came back for a visit and everything seemed a bit different. Pieces were smaller and the fish wasn't fresh at all. The tuna had this pale pink to it, it looked so weird. For the same price, the sushi place by midland and ellesmere is much better. Comes with soup, salad and congee! This place only offered a soup, not even a salad."}
{"text":"Yummy! My partner and I were really excited to try this place. We came in around 3:30pm so we had the whole place to ourselves. Looking at the menu, there were many interesting items to choose from. It was about of fun to look through the menu and to see what we could get. The possibilities were endless!  We ordered the crazy roll, serpentine roll, and sashimi combo (15pc) and salmon sushi roll.  The ratio of rice and fish was great. There was just enough of rice. There was a good amount of fish in each roll. Each roll was fun to try. The sashimi plate had delicious tuna, butter fish, white tuna, and salmon. The sashimi was flavorful and we especially enjoyed the soft taste of white tuna.  We also noticed that the wasabi did not appear to taste old, it was fresh and very spicy! They gave plenty of wasabi and ginger.  I took off one star because their service wasn't more than expected."}
{"text":"Was in the area and decided to visit this place after reading all the highly rated reviews on Yelp. First impression: small, cozy, restaurant; friendly staff (Korean owned sushi joint). The menu is standard but quite extensive. They have nigiri, bentos, tempura, specialty rolls, and korean food such as bulgolgi.   Ordered 3 specialty rolls; salmon sashimi roll, rainbow roll, and hurricane roll. Presentation = 9/10. Sushi = fresh and yummy.   Something I wasn't too impressed about was the size of the mixed tempura. It cost $13.95 and the order included 4 shrimp tempura, 1 yam, 1 broccoli, and 1 cucumber. I feel like it was severely overpriced with each piece costing us almost $2 each. It just ain't that great of a deal.  Overall, 3.5 stars. But I'm giving it 3 stars. Will I be back? Maybe not. There are just so many restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Very clean I felt comfortable good looking food, tasty, fresh ,  fast service if you want some good sushi this is the place to go :"}
{"text":"First time here and it was great! First expectation after walking in was already 5 stars for me. The atmosphere, food and service was really good. The place is really small but you get service quickly and you get your food right away.  I got the salmon teriyaki bento lunch special and the crispy crunch roll. The quality was really good that I enjoyed every last bite of it. Definitely coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Small restaurant with a really friendly woman I assume is the proprietor and overall very attentive polite service. We ordered the chicken teriyaki which had a lot of very tender white meat with tummy teriyaki sauce on peppery cabbage, shrimp tempura which came with rice and 8 very delicately battered and fried shrimp.  Both were really good.  We also got the fresh sashimi (which is 9 slices of fish and you can even pick the salmon only option), a tempura roll and some nigiri.  The sashimi tasted just a slight bit frozen but the portions were good and generally all fresh. There was a steady flow of takeout sushi platters being prepared."}
{"text":"surprisingly good for a small place in this part of town. Had the special dragon roll which was very good. Friend had the chirashi bowl, the portion was very generous and the sashimi very fresh."}
{"text":"Came with the family for dinner last night. Ordered the medium sashimi platter ($44.95 for 46 pieces), a heart roll ($10.95), a hurricane roll ($12.95), and a cottage roll ($13.95). We also got an order of hamachi belly sashimi ($9.95 for 3 pieces).   Overall, the food was fresh and tasty. The medium platter could use a little variety. Lots of salmon. About four pieces each of red tuna, white tuna, hamachi, snapper?. Two octopus, I think. Also two to four surf clam. I forget. Feel free to look at the pictures for reference. For a platter that large, I was expecting some saba (mackerel) and perhaps some ika (squid), and perhaps two or so amaebi (sweet shrimp). I like salmon, but if I'm ordering a platter, I want variety, and that was a bit lacking.  The heart roll was cute, but more novelty in shape than in taste. There ends up being an uneven distribution of ingredients, so the first half of the roll will taste different than the second half.  The hurricane was very tasty. Love the different sauces on there. Ended up dipping my sashimi into the remaining sauce on the plate.  The cottage roll was fresh, and not so heavy on the stomach. For a soy paper wrapped roll, not particularly expensive either. I find that usually, soy paper wrapped rolls cost more than the average specialty roll, and also have fewer pieces. Each of these specialty rolls, including this one, came with 8 pieces.  The hamachi belly was nice and fatty. My first time having this particular cut, and I quite enjoyed it. Not cheap though, even if the pieces were a nice size (they were!).  It was my mom's birthday, and the chef made her some sashimi flowers! That was pretty. Three flowers - one red tuna, one white tuna, and one salmon, each topped with different colors of fish eggs.  My dad also mentioned that they should have thrown in one more piece of hamachi belly because there were four of us, and I guess they felt bad, because they ended up giving us four pieces of complimentary hamachi cheek sashimi. Way to go dad? The cheek sashimi was not quite as fatty as the belly, but tastier than their regular cut of hamachi.   Service was good. Place was clean. Free WiFi. I'll be back to have more of their specialty rolls. I'm a sucker for specialty rolls, and this place has a whole lot of them."}
{"text":"Been here three times now. I really enjoy it.  The first time I had no idea what I was ordering or what I would like. I loved the miso soup so much I ordered another one. I had a bento box and shared a California roll. Thoroughly enjoyed it so much I went back a week later and brought my Daughter.  The second time I was upset that the bento box was a lunch special and unfortunately we missed it. So I had the teriyaki chicken and yet again, very happy.  Third time, again a Cali roll but this time I had salmon teriyaki. I am not a big fan of salmon but really enjoyed this.  I can't wait to go back again to try something new. Maybe someone out there will give me a suggestion?"}
{"text":"Our go-to place in the area. Competitive prices and average quality. It just isn't as good as pretty much every place downtown."}
{"text":"Made the trip here after all these yelp reviews and have to say this is a great small sushi place!   I have not been to this place prior to their new re-opening but was impressed with their current operations: the place is bright, clean, and inviting  There are also many big screens with pictures of their food. We ordered the ichiban sashimi combo and three special rolls - the firecracker, special dragon roll, and the hurricane rolls.   The sashimi combo included red snapper, salmon, butterfish, and tuna. It was extremely fresh and delicious. On their website they say they use top quality fish from Norway/Scotland/Canada waters and not Japan. I was really impressed with their quality here but could have felt they could have included more than four types of sashimi here.   The special rolls were all awesome. They were warm and were the melt-in-your mouth kind of awesome, which I love!  The rolls were 8 pieces each but I felt they were on the small side though? So order up! If we had a bigger party, the 10 special rolls for $90 is an amazing deal. But it may only be for takeout?    Roll breakdown: - Firecracker - spicy tuna with tuna and crab meat on top drizzled with spicy mayo.  - Hurricane - lots going on here! It was a California with shrimp tempura topped off with tuna, tobico and various sauces. A Sriracha like hot sauce on top was a nice little kick of flavor. I don't like cream cheese in my sushi but here it was subtle and semi-melted so it was really good. - Special dragon - typical Cali + shrimp tempura topped with BBQ eel and unagi sauce. Good quality eel here.   Service was okay, there was just one lady serving the place though. All in all would definitely come back here for some great quality sushi."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb dot com - great quality/fresh sushi at a low price. I've had \"cheap\" sushi at many places in Scarborough and this place by far blows them away. If you want consistently great sushi and great service this place is it. Hidden gem for sure."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood sushi restaurant.  The sushi was fresh, service was fast and friendly, and the prices are reasonable.  Will come by again!"}
{"text":"A rare-for-the area good Japanese restaurant in a neighborhood that is dominated by Indian and other ethnic food. Though the owner is Korean, he uses good quality fresh fish and does not cut corners. Service could be slow sometimes but they try very hard to please."}
{"text":"Rating: more like a 3.5 but ¯\_(?)_/¯   TLDR: good service, average but fresh food with a fair/ average price. And a LOT of choices. But if you're one of those people who has high expectations for fish or eat sushi a lot, this probably isNT your new go to. If u want specifics read on.   Cute little place (maybe seat 20 people?) that was clean and bright, a big contrast to the street that it was on. Anyway, the people there were so nice, and service was really great.   We went there at around 8:30 and ordered the Chirashi rice (mixed fish with bed of rice), Valentine roll #39, if I remember correctly, and a veggie tempura: our total was about $38.   The fish on the Chirashi was fresh, but it wasn't cold enough. It was kind of... too soft and like room temp. I think if it was cold, the fish would've tasted better. But it might be bc we showed up like an hour before closing? But nonetheless I think it should've been colder no matter the time to keep the quality. The rice wasn't sour enough and a little too hard but overall this dish was fine, had a large variety of fish, and super filling.   The Valentine roll was interesting. There was this topping that was interesting (fried potato and fish egg). The roll itself was average though - Spicy salmon with California roll (i think). I think all the rolls were really Korean inspired because usually Korean sushi places are all quite extra with their sushi rolls (no hate tho it's all cool).   Veggie tempura was a yay with its 7 prices. Had Light and fluffy batter that was crunchy. The veggies inside were good. Overall no complaints with this dish.   Overall I think the price was fair and food was fresh. There were a lot of choices but probably won't be back very often."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I recently moved in the area and are amazed at the hidden gems in the area and Sushi Ichiban is one of them. Initially, we were drawn to this place because we were looking for good sushi close by and Sushi Ichiban had a near perfect 5 stars so why not?   You know you are going to a great sushi place when there are only a few tables serving quality, well prepared sushi. We got the Ichiban sashimi, valentine roll (must have!) and hurricane roll. The fish is extremely fresh and the sushi chef is extremely skilled at delivering sushi rolls as delicious as they are beautiful.   The salmon roe on the sushi rolls is not your typical ayce stuff, it's healthy red and feels luxurious. The service and people are extremely friendly and kind.   I am a regular takeout customer and have been back multiple times this month, just take my money!!! Lol"}
{"text":"First time here. Still exploring the neighbourhood for gems.  Very courteous service. Lovely fresh fish and clean.  Excited that they have Jap Chae, although Korean I kinda love it and had to get some take out.  I'll be back absolutely.  This was a lovely Sunday afternoon surprise adventure.  There are a lot of all you can eat buffet sushi places in the area, which don't necessarily dictate fresh or good service, so I was very pleased to find this place.  Will have to explore their menu. Today I stuck with my fave pieces of Nigiri and a hand roll to test the waters.  Generous portions of fish and as mentioned incredibly fresh.  Once I've been back a few times I'm hoping to change the rating to 5 stars."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp and was surprised by its high rating that I had to come here for lunch to see for myself!   Finding the restaurant was a bit difficult as it is located in the corner of a strip with Indian, Filipino, and Chinese food.   The menu prices have gone up a bit from the prices that I saw on the Yelp photos but regardless, it was still reasonable. We ordered the roll combo $9.95 and sushi and tempura combo $13.95. The rolls were decent but I wished the rice had a stronger rice vinegar flavour.  The service was impeccable as the waitress made sure our cups of tea were always full and came multiple times to refill for us. Also, the waitress was very polite in her greeting when we came as well as when we left.   Miscellaneous comment that I want to add is that the washroom is very clean; in fact, it is probably the best washroom I've been to at a sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Location: Sushi Ichiban is tucked away in a little plaza on Ellesmere that you would probably normally drive past. Put the address in your GPS to be lead to the most delicious sushi.  Parking: Limited parking spots - I have been during lunch a couple times, and have had to wait a few minutes for another car to leave. When I have come on the weekend, I was able to park no problem.  Food: FRESH! The fish is so fresh. And delicious. I have tried the sashimi, spicy tuna and spicy salmon rolls, and chicken teriyaki... Highly recommend it all, especially the sashimi.   Service: Always smiling faces who are ready to provide whatever you need!  Price: They have bento boxes that are only available at lunchtime, which are great value for your money. Outside of lunchtime, the prices are not cheap, but I do think it's worth it for the quality, freshness, and service.  I am glad I found this hidden gem! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One day last week while sitting on the couch the craving for sushi hit real hard.  Thankfully Yelp led me to the direction of this great find.  Now funny enough I have passed by this place a multitude of times.  It's in the plaza of my local Hakka place that I go to.  I've always said I would try it but I'm so mad that I never did because it's good!  And close by!  It's a small place - probably about 15-20 people can dine in, but that's ok b/c they do take out.    I ordered the crunchy spicy salmon and crunchy spicy tuna roll along with the butterfish sashimi and the tuna sashimi.  They were quick to prepare everything and it was fresh tasting.  The rolls had a lovely deep flavour (since they are deep fried!) and a lovely crunch to them.  They were about $6 each for the roll.   The sashimi pieces were light and fresh - I wish they were a little bit colder but then again since I took it as takeout maybe this caused it to warm up a bit on the way back.    The service is nice - all the staff were really polite and never made me feel rushed as I took my time trying to decide.  The ambiance of the place is nice but small.  Locate across from Parkway Mall you will probably have better luck if you either park at the mall or the plaza next to the sushi place and walk over.  The parking lot here is JAMMED always and narrow so just save yourself the aggravation and walk over from another lot.  I'm looking forward to going back and trying some of their other items and their lunch specials.  Too bad they are closed today (Good Friday) b/c I'm getting sushi regrets for not picking up some last night  :("}
{"text":"Service was great. Sashimi was good, sushi was great.  But their salad dressing could have been better. We ordered the sashimi lunch bento special and chicken teriyaki bento. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Not sure why the reviews are so high on yelp. The quality of the sushi were very ordinary and reminded me a lot to AYCE, except it's a lot cheaper for the latter.   I was here for a business lunch meeting with a client, who flew in from Alberta. The restaurant is definitely nice and clean, with a lot of natural lighting. Perfect place for a meeting (or a date) !  Sushi chef and hostess were very pleasant and welcoming. Our tea cups were always filled with green tea & we had abundant pickled ginger to clean our palate.   I would probably come back again to try out their bento boxes, just not the sushi. Prices seem reasonable.   TIP:  Skip the eel!! I ended up having an unusual stomachache! :O Not good for first impression!!"}
{"text":"Came here to try the salmon teriyaki bento box & the tempura /sushi bento, we were first served with a miso soup, and within 5 minutes later, the food was served. The salad dressing had a strange taste to it, and even my friend agreed, the salmon was pretty mediocre - until I found a strand of hair in it and my appetite was completely ruined. The soya sauce that the restaurant uses, is very salty, therefore be careful when you're eating the rolls. Overall, it was good to try, but probably won't be back. There are much better options in the area."}
{"text":"Just leave the restaurant less than one hour ,My family got bellyache and diarrhea , so sad :(  We got sushi sashimi boat , my Dad got a tempura   Meal and he didn't eat the raw fish , he was fine.  It was the second time been there, no more again"}
{"text":"So apparently, my first review of this place got flagged by Yelp probably because they thought I was spamming or advertising, which implied that I knew the owner (which I did not before eating here). So I guess I shall keep it short (to see the original, scroll down and click the \"Reviews that are not currently recommended\") and give an update on this place.   The renovations are very nice (though I've never been here before it was renovated). The service is absolutely fantastic as usual. The food is really good along with the price (if you get the sushi boat it is totally worth the money compared to other sushi places). I come here fairly often now and have gotten friends and family to come here too.   The portions are good too. This isn't an AYCE sushi joint where bigger is better. The bigger it is usually means the more rice there is. Quality over quantity. All in all I'll be going back, as I usually do."}
{"text":"Small location but great sushi. Beautiful plates and the quality was top notch. The tuna was very firm and fresh tasting. It was probably the best tuna sashimi I have had in Toronto. It is a tad expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"3.5 :)  Discovered this restaurant through the Yelp app and decided to try it as we were in the neighbourhood. When we first entered the restaurant, we were immediately greeted and seated.  The inside of the restaurant has been completely renovated and the restaurant looks modern and contemporary. The ambiance was awesome. The menu offers many different rolls however the recommended rolls were the most delicious. They have a star beside them. It was stated that the chef used to work at the Thompson Hotel and you see this within his dishes, his attention to detail and experience were highlighted. We tried the tuna tataki role and we were not disappointed. The sashimi was fresh and the rolls have wonderful flavour with a good balance of rice and filling. The prices are very affordable and they even provide combos for those who would like the typical roles like california roll or spicy salmon roll. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I avoided the regular lunch/dinner time to not give any biased judgement if they make a mistake due to a lot of customers.   1. Service: the serving lady was nice and friendly. She gives you a smile before she talks to you.   2. Quality vs Quantity vs Price: the quality is pretty high, sushi are handmade from their sushi bar after the customer order to keep the freshness. Sushi, lunch box and sashimi are a little bit over-priced, compare to their rolls(which are much more recommended since the portion is big and cheaper).   3. Atmosphere: the interior is clean and not overly decorated, and the music played in the background is relaxing. No complain on that.   In the end, Sushi Ichiban is a place for singles to enjoy some good food, couples to chill in their happy little world, and a group of friends to chow down authentic Japanese cuisine and have the time of their lives."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to come to this little gem in the neighbourhood to try some good quality sushi! When i say gem, this is truly a hidden one. The restaurant was located in a small strip plaza across from Parkway Mall. To be frank, there really isn't much there, except for this place of course! The restaurant is quite small, can only fit about 20 people or so, but ambience is nice, bright lights, very clean. Our party of 3 decided to order a medium platter of sushi, sashimi and rolls, and also ordered a hurricane roll on the side.  I must admit, i really loved the hurricane roll! To the point where I almost wished I ordered more than one to try. the Hurricane roll is delicious!  This roll contains avocado, crabmeat, shrimp tempura, cream cheese that is topped with 2 pc of fresh tuna, 2 pcs of white tuna, tobico and dressed with Louisiana hot sauce and mayo... this combo is exquisite! Never thought of using this type of hot sauce on sushi, but the flavour was amazing!  Their menu has some other 'chef favourites' marked with a heart; i really want to try some other rolls next time. next came the medium boat with sashimi, sushi and rolls. There was california rolls and also spicy salmon rolls with a dollop of hot sauce and mayo on it. for sushi there was a wide selection of salmon, tuna, white tuna, octopus, eel, shrimp, snapper. For sashimi there was tuna, snapper, white tuna, salmon, octopus and surf clam. The fish is definitely very fresh. My only comment would be that some of the sashimi i wished was cut a bit smaller, because when you eat giant pieces of sashimi you feel full super fast. otherwise eveyrthing was very fresh, and also presented beautifully. I would definitely say that this is now going to become a new favourite esp because the prices are more reasonable and I don't have to go all the way downtown to miku to get good quality sushi :)  All this food filled the 3 of us comfortably full :) I definitely would like to go back and have some of their dinner or lunch boxes, as well as some more of the specialty rolls. The chef/owner worked at one of the Toronto hotels many years previously. I also really like that they can tell you where their fish comes from. I would say the quality is definitely quite up there, and they don't use any of the Japan fish, which is good because we all know that the radiation effects unfortunately are still there.  Anyway beauitful place for some good quality sushi. Will definitely be going back, and may even order some party trays in the future!"}
{"text":"Recently we ordered a large takeout order. My friends have been here before and enjoyed the food. However, the service is quite a miss. Two times in a row they got the order wrong. First time they ordered the large party tray then charged them extra large tray. When they brought up the mistake the restaurant tried to blame the server and said it was an error because she was new. On our visit, they left out an item and tried to argue that it was not ordered. Also, they did give us any soy sauce for our sushi party tray order. Food is not bad, but be sure to check your bill before paying."}
{"text":"Delicious and memorable.   Delicious because the  sushi rolls were tasty and I was craving them.  Memorable because  we saw Jian Ghomeshi sitting at the corner table with a lady friend.   Parking is hard to find and it gets busy so fast!  But will defo go back again!"}
{"text":"I'm normally an AYCE sushi restaurant goer since I can get a lot more variety of food, but I've decided to give this a la cart restaurant a try to see if the quality of the fish would be better.   Environment: This is a small restaurant located at a small plaza near Ellesmere/Pharmacy. It's really easy to drive past the plaza and not notice anything if you're not specifically looking for this restaurant. Also, parking is very limited at this plaza. The restaurant itself is pretty small, which kinda reminds me of restaurants located downtown. I think the maximum they can seat is 6 people together, though coming in even smaller groups would be better, since the place is super small and you can basically hear the conversation of the table next to you.   Food: I agree with the some of the reviews here, the dishes are kinda pricey and you would need to order a bunch of stuff to get full. I went with my boyfriend and we each ordered a dish, they both came with miso soup. I was full from my 8 piece sushi roll, but I could tell he was still hungry after his meal. The dishes were delicious though and the fish was fresh and not soggy like some other AYCE sushi restaurants, but it just wasn't enough for one person.  Service: It's refreshing to go to a restaurant run by actual Japanese people. The sushi chefs and the servers are all Japanese. The service was good and the server came over multiple times to ask us how we're doing and how was the food. Even though her English wasn't so good she was really nice and welcoming.   After giving this place a try I feel AYCE is still more worth it in the end, not that this place is bad (the food is quite delicious actually), but I just prefer the variety of AYCE and the unlimited sashimi."}
{"text":"Fresh and quality come together and make a great experience. Good lunch special too. Service is on point here,  the lady who works here is very friendly."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Thursday. The place is very small and seats about 15 to 20 people max. The sushi was fresh and everything tasted good but nothing really stood out as being great. Everything was pretty average. And after spending $45 between two people I was not even close to full.  15 piece sashimi $15.95 Cottage roll $13.95 Seaweed salad with sliced cucumbers and assorted sashimi $5.95  Service was good. Not sure how this place gets 4.5 average review."}
{"text":"This restaurant now has new owners, and there was a renovation complete with sushi chef and a sit-up bar. Much better then previously. I really liked the dynamite roll!"}
{"text":"I've come here a few times & I've always been happy. It's the only good sushi place I've found in Scarborough. The prices are good to decent depending on what you get. My Mom always gets a noodles dish for like $10 & has like three meals out of it. The sushi is more but it's good."}
{"text":"The inside of the restaurant is cute and cozy, great for a date. The service is quick and attentive. I had a miso soup, the Salmon, tuna, and butterfish as sushi and sashimi for a total cost of $43, which includes tip. I found the sushi and sashimi not bad. It wasn't the best I've had, but it also wasn't the worst I've had. I will probably return and try something else."}
{"text":"Delicious and memorable experience! It was hard to find but was very memorable :) I hope this place doesn't get too overcrowded but I had to share it! (No relation to the owners) Ok, bye!"}
{"text":"I've ordered a takeout platter from here once and it tasted amazing, so I decided to come for dinner. We came at around 8 on a Friday night. The restaurant is very clean and quite small but there were many tables available. It seemed more like a takeout place as there weren't many people ordering and then sitting down at the restaurant.  We ordered the medium size for the sushi, sashimi, and roll combo which consists of 50 pieces for $49.99. The presentation of this dish is amazing! There was a good variety of sashimi. However, I found that the rice was warm for some of our rolls, and it lacked the flavour of vinegar.   Service was also very friendly as our server poured hot tea for us throughout the meal. This place is a solid option if you're not looking for AYCE and want to fill your belly with sushi alongside a few people!"}
{"text":"First time at this sushi joint...was not disappointed.  Sushi Ichiban is definitely a must for sushi lovers. The service was great. The hostess was really polite..oh and they take reservations. I'm happy I found this place. Will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I got take out from here and it's quite pricey but I suppose the quality is there.  I was most impressed by the presentation (even for take out). I opened the box at work and I immediately had to show my coworkers.  Taste wise, it was very standard. Everything tasted fresh and good.  I would come back here if I wanted some fancy quality sushi. However, it is a bit out of my price point (I'm used to Sushi Bong's price and quantity)."}
{"text":"I'm from Hawaii and it's our last few days in Canada with our Canadian family that lives here. Being from Hawaii there are so many sushi places to eat.  I just want t to thank our server who was gracious to seat seven of us on such a short notice.  Especially the Chefs that prepared our sushi.  The boat and all the sushi we had were superb and excellent. I wish you would open one in Hawaii. We really loved the Valentine roll.  I also liked the Sundae roll.  Mahalo(Thank you in Hawaiian)!!! One of the best sushi places I've ever had."}
{"text":"Very solid!! Really clean and fresh fish, no complaints whatsoever. Fast and very helpful and huge selection of signature rolls (over 40 to be exact). Well worth it if you're in Ellesmere and Vic Park hood."}
{"text":"Came in for quick bite with a friend.  Place is small and cozy. 1 sushi chef, 1 waitress, and 1 helper in the back.  Buddy ordered a mixed tempura with rice dinner combo, about $20 tax and tip in.   I ordered a futomaki, 3 pcs hototagai sashimi, and 2 pcs salmon belly sushi. About $28 tax and tip in.  Tempura batter was thick and therefore not crispy enough.  Futomaki portion was big, but the maki size was small. Didn't have enough neta (ingredients). Futomaki means big roll. Therefore chef didn't come across authentic.  Shari (rice) on the salmon belly was warm, salmon belly neta was nice portion.  Hototagai (giant scallop) was highlight, although it was only 2 pcs cut into 4.. menu said 3 pcs.. the sashimi felt fresh and satisfying.  Asked for toro, but it was unavailable. Would have been $30 for 2 pcs.. market rate would be 3 pcs.  Service was slow but expected for a small 3 person operation.  Nothing special, a bit over priced therefore slightly under par."}
{"text":"It is a small and cozy restaurant with good quality food. The workers checked up on is couple times, but not excessively. I ordered the tuna tataki rolls, it wasnt mind blowing but the price is good.  Food came with delicious miso soup that isnt too salty like many places.  A decent store located in a relatively sketchy area! Rare!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi. Basically ditto on the other reviews. Got the small b sushi and roll combo. Came with 2 rolls, including a dynamite roll. And a variety of nigiri sushi, including salmon, butter fish, shrimp, octopus, surf clam, unagi. Came with miso soup and tea. Fish was excellent. Rolls were delicious; rice was perfect. What really stood out was the surf clam and octopus. The stuff were used to is usually tough but this was tender. Service was very friendly and attentive. Can't wait to return! Will try the daily specials for lunch. And some of the large variety of specialty rolls. Slightly pricier than the usual Chinese run place but only slightly and therefore a great value for what you get!"}
{"text":"My sushi standard is not high but this place disappointed me greatly with service and the food. The prices weren't any better for the portion and quality.   We came for lunch and ordered your standard sashimi and a bento. The waitress wrote our order and recapped it and mid way into our sashimi we did not get our bento box and the waitress was quite to get the bill. My sister frequent last this place and I am not sure why but I certainty will not visit it again."}
{"text":"I heard many reviews about this location and decided to check it out. It did live up to its claim as this restaurant was very delicious and extraordinary. The food was good quality and one of the best sushi restaurants out there. The prices are mid ranged as a boat of assorted sushi for two people was 50$ before tax/tip.   The place was very small and compact. Although it was tight, the atmosphere was very comfortable and the service was great. The waiters were friendly and funny.   I would definitely come back and recommend this place to a friend! I would give this a 4.5 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Do not be fooled by the location. This is a great place for sushi!  Dined here twice and both times were a 5/5 experience.  Service: Is great. It is a family run business and you get the service you would expect from one. We ordered a lot of sushi but only one of us ordered soup (not included) our server asked if we all wanted soup on the house. I thought that was very generous of her.  Food: Great value. Ordered various rolls and all of them not only tasted great but was also well presented. Average about $20 a person.  Overall: Hidden gem and something worth trying but if you want to dine in I would recommend calling ahead of time for reservations. Seating is extremely limited. Parking is also limited and surprisingly busy (there are other businesses that share the parking space)."}
{"text":"This is kind of a hidden gem and I'm hoping not EVERYONE is going to go to. The price is kinda pricey but it is totally worth it. There's never a waiting line and the place is kind of small and cozy. I was here on a nice date and the service was absolutely amazing. Japanese people are the best!! The sushi was absolutely delicious. Almost above par because of how fresh the fish is.  Their lunch boxes are definitely affordable and we went to try their love boat which was around $70-80 for around (65 pcs). Isn't bad for a place like this. I loved their spicy salmon roll.   I'd come again (very soon actually)! ;)"}
{"text":"Very fresh sushi! The service was great! Place was clean and small. I would definitely come back again!  Strongly recommend the Sundae roll, Valentine roll, Dream roll and the cottage roll. Friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"I visited Ichiban based on the abundance of positive reviews on Yelp. The venue was small (5 tables and bar seats) but cozy and well-decorated. We ordered a large boat and the portion was just right for 4 adults. The sushi and sashimi were very fresh, but the maki were small and assembled poorly. The highlight of this restaurant is definitely its outstanding customer service and hospitality, which is expected from a venue of this size. Ice cream is not included even in the biggest of orders, which is uncommon for many sushi places. Unless you live in the local area, the overall experience does not warrant the gas and time spent on the commute. There are other hidden gems out there."}
{"text":"After a few visits this resturant and it has been become my favorite sushi resturant in Scarborough.  Small place with 5 tables that seat up to 4 people each but plenty of space so you don't feel like you are dining with the next table.  Food is always fresh and delicious, nicely presented like sushi should be.  Owners and staff very friendly.  I recommend this place to anyone looking for a good sushi experience while in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Sushi Ichiban is a solid neighbourhood Sushi Restaurant.  The interior has been newly renovated and the menu is all the traditional items plus a good selection of  rolls.   Lunch Special on weekday till 3 pm has various bento box if not there is some all day special at a reasonable price.  Sushi and Tempura Lunch Bento Box ($11.95) was A-OK.   Great if you are in the area and want to have some sushi.   Maybe dinner is much better? That will be another separate review."}
{"text":"Ehhhhh. A good neighbourhood local sushi joint. A bit on the pricier side for what you get, but overall not bad. The service was fast and friendly when we went for lunch during a weekday and they have a few tables for those who want to eat in. Would I come back? Sure, if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This is the freshest sushi I've ever had in Scarborough.  Don't second guess. Just go!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. Everything was so fresh, I had the sashimi bento which had like 9 pieces of sashimi and California roll with rice and miso soup and salad.  This is great for a group of 2 - 4. They don't really have seating for a group bigger then that.   They have lunch specials which was what I had. Though their regular menu looks spectacular as well. I would recommend their crispy roll as the other table ordered it and instantly I regret not getting it!"}
{"text":"From the beginning it was a bit frustrating because we came in a group of 5, and we decided to get the Special Roll Combo reg: 89.99, and took a while deciding which rolls we would get.... 15 minutes later ready to order our 10 rolls, the waitress tells us it's only a take-out item... And we keep getting pressured to order something.   After that it got a bit better, we ordered the extra large roll order reg:100, we received a beautifully presented boat full of sushi and sashimi. Plus a plate of rolls...  The plate of rolls was terrible to be honest, but the boat of sushi and sashimi was quite delicious and fresh!   Service overall was friendly, courteous and fast, except for the time wasted and miss understanding.  As a suggestion I would put a note that the special roll combo is a take-out item only."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and ambiance. Food is excellent and very reasonable. I would strongly recommend. Only hang up is the parking, which is small considering the number of services in the little plaza. Try to avoid lunch time rush."}
{"text":"A favourite Friday night treat. Eat in or take out the dishes are beautifully presented. Staff are welcoming and super friendly, food is delicious. Luckily this hidden treasure is very close to home!"}
{"text":"There is a cozy and family-vibe to this small Japanese restaurant tucked away in a plaza. I was pleased with all the tempura, udon w/ handroll, sashimi I ordered. They also serve some Korean dishes because the owners are Korean. They offer a wide variety of maki rolls and a la carte fish. I found the food reasonably fresh and presented well. The prices were justifiable with the portion and quality and on top of that, I had no complaints about the service. I do not see a reason why you wouldn't give this place a chance if you're in the neighbourhood. Solid 4.5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"This is my most favourite sushi joint in Scarborough! So good in fact I can forgive the fact that it's not AYCE which is my forte. It is a cute, quaint place that seats at most maybe 20 people.  The staff were super friendly. After looking at the menu we decided to order the medium sushi, sashimi, and roll combo (46 pieces, $44.95), firecracker roll ($12.95), and the valentine roll ($10.95) to split between the 5 of us. They gave us teas right after ordering and miso soup to start us off. I think about 15 minutes later they bring us the boat of sushi and wow were we impressed! Presentation was on point. The sushi tasted so fresh and everything was well prepared. My favourite had to be the valentine roll because it had shredded crunchy potato strings on top which gave the roll a little something extra.  The head chef was the one bringing out the orders and he was able to split our bill 5 ways which was nice of him. I recommend this place as the entire dining experience was wonderful and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"I had a hankering for some sushi so I whipped out my trusty yelp app to help satisfy my cravings. I noticed a spot around the corner from where I was with high ratings and decided to try it out. Long story short - I was extremely happy with my decision.  I came in around 6pm on a Friday evening and the place was packed. And by packed I mean there are literally only 6 tables and about 6 spots around the sushi bar and every single seat was filled. I suppose that was a good sign. As we entered a cheery waitress greeted us and said the wait wouldn't be too long. She was right as two tables were finishing up and we were seated within 10 minutes.   She brought us over two menus and was smiling ear to ear and super friendly. Right after bringing us the menus she returned with two cups of tea. I began sipping on the tea as we browsed the menus eying all the different rolls they had to offer. The tea was super delicious and had comforting flavours that I couldn't quite put my finger on. When the waitress came back to take our order I asked was kind of tea it was. She graciously explained it was a roasted corn and barley tea and it is a very common drink in every household in Korea.  Within a few short minutes our food started rolling out  Miso Soup- Adored there miso soup soo savoury and creamy not watered down at all!  Edamame - Simply prepared boiled and nicely salted - why mess with a good thing right?  Vegetable Tempura- 7 Huge pieces and light and crispy battered vegetables that were perfectly cooked and piping hot. The vegetables consisted of butternut squash, sweet potatoes, broccoli, and onion  Bulgogi Dinner - Korean style marinated sliced beef rib-eye on a sizzling plate comes with rice, salad, and miso soup. This was a hugeeee portion and came beautifully served on a sizzling hot plate. The beef was perfectly cooked super tender with the perfect combo of sweet and salty flavours. I also enjoyed the little bit of sweet potato noodles woven through out the meat.  Spicy Salmon and Spicy Tuna Roll - Good sized rolls, very fresh tasting, and super spicy as each roll had a lovely dollop of sriracha crowning it   Valentine Roll - Avocado, cucumber, crab meat, topped with spicy salmon, shredded crunch potato, and special sauce Humungous sized roll!!! This roll was unlike anything i've seen before; the top of the roll was draped with super crispy fried strings of potato that added another dimension to the already jam packed roll, the spicy fresh salmon salmon added a nice punch of heat and the creamy special sauce balanced everything out - Hands down one of the Best rolls i've ever had!  Green Tea Ice Cream - Nice matcha flavour, creamy, and not too sweet, perfect ending to a wonderful meal!  Overall a spectacular find! Thanks Yelp! Food came out super fast, great sized portions, and very flavourful. Service here is amazing! Our waitress was super friendly and efficient - she noticed how much I was enjoying my tea and constantly refilled it before it even got the chance to reach empty every single time. She was also the only waitress in the whole joint and was gracious and attentive to every patron. Also another bonus this place does take out and it seemed to be very popular - while we were dining I noticed many people coming in to pick up there orders. I will definitely be returning for both take out and dine in options!"}
