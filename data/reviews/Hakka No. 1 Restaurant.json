{"text":"Food is very flavourful and worth the money. You get your money's worth for what you pay, quantities are very large. Try the lunch specials, they're around 6.50 and 7.50 from 11am-4pm! I recommend the ginger chicken and honey garlic chicken! Customer service is average"}
{"text":"We chose go to this restaurant based on the great yelp reviews.  What a find!  We will definitely be back.  We chose our meal based on the recommendations of other reviewers and were really pleased!  As each dish came to the table we were greeted by a fabulous fragrance that made us even hungrier!  The Shanghai noodles with beef were very favourable and had a good amount of vegetables mixed in.  We couldn't get enough of the Thai Spicy Chicken Soup.  Fabulous flavours.  We decided that next time we could order a large bowl of the soup and be completely satisfied.  We also had the Chili Chicken Dry and Bok Choy.  Also great!  Service was fast and very polite.  Much appreciated.  And pleased to discover that there are a total of 4 locations to choose from!  The extensive menu beckons future visits."}
{"text":"This was the first time we used this restaurant. Nice little dining room but we had takeout that night. The Chili chicken and rice were fabulous. We also had a tasty beef and vegetable dish, but I can't recall the name of it. All the food was delicious. Prices were very reasonable . It's great to have another great restaurant in the neighbourhood. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Ate a late lunch @ 3:30 pm on a Sunday stumbled upon this place.  Had  chilly chicken dry on their lunch special for 5.95.  Incredible and now my 2nd favorite place to get chilly chicken!  Will come again to try out their manturian etcs!"}
{"text":"Such a great place! My boyfriend and I have found our new favourite spot for comfort food. Whenever we go there are a few customers for takeout and never really many seating. All in all the service is great, fast and friendly. We often get the Corn Soup (my fave), black bean beef and the chili fish. I do wish they had more tofu dishes."}
{"text":"Delicious food, generous portions and prepared quickly for pick up.  Our family favourite is 'chili gobi dry' from a different hakka restaurant but this is the first time we've ever ordered anything that compares - manchurian cauliflower - yummmm!  We ordered: manchurian cauliflower (double order), singapore chicken rice noodles, and curry chicken spring rolls.  It was all delicious.  I prefer singapore noodles to be a bit spicier so I will ask them to spice this dish up a bit the next time we order.  Yes, there will definitely be a 'next order'.  A nice new neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"We ordered the small Corn Soup, very good and plenty for 2 persons. Lemon Chicken w/steamed rice, sauce on the side. Spicy Garlic Beef/gravy w/steamed rice. Lemon was nice and sweet, beef was Spicy, have an extra napkin for your nose.  There are also condiments on the table, little sliced peppers which were very good, low spicy. Thick Red pepper sauce, tasty but very! Hot. Very nice on the sweet lemon chicken.  Highly recommended, would go back. Very reasonably priced. The two entrees were plenty for 2 adults and a hungry teenager."}
{"text":"Terrible food, expensive, extremely poor service. Spent $50+ there and received mediocre food at best. Would not recommend, worst decision ever to try out a new place. Many positive reviews are fake, or paid for by management to manipulate their ratings, the whole retaurant is a ghost town, see for your self."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Shanghai noodles were delicious and the chili chicken dry was the best I've had! And the spicy pepper shrimp appetizer was awesome! Oh ya don't forget the Thai spicy chicken soup was great although be aware there was tofu and peas but still delicious!   I'd come back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Great Hakka Resto in not the best locals of the city. I been there many times but didn't appreciate them asking me the last time if I had enough money to pay for my last meal.  But, it is in fairly Newly built open air mall with all shopping amenities eg. Many food shopping eg. A fairly large Food basics grocers, Shoppers drug mart, butcher m meats,  GNC vitamins, few eating franchise est.  A great size library on Lawrence. But, the local is a lower class subsidized housing complex  within rundown FLEE INFESTED MOTELS?!!! Some good vs. The bad- many beggars or psychos at night especially. BECAREFUL TRY TO BE WITH SOMEONE NOT ALone."}
{"text":"I lived close to this place for 8 years and never went to this gem of a restaurant. Its look a little sketchy but the food is unbelievable!! Even cops from division close by came here to eat lol!!! There's something for carnivores and herbivores. The staff was really nice and accommodative. The prices are also pretty good for the food you get. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We like the chilli chicken, pakora and the bombay is really good too. Great lunch special deals. Nothing fancy but hits the spot."}
{"text":"I've tried various different Hakka joints and normally they have a few dishes that are good. One of the best dishes I would say from this Hakka restaurant would be the Bombay chicken! I've had their beef dishes and it wasn't that great. It's nice and crisp and packed with flavour. (It's on their lunch special as well)"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem around UTSC. There are other competing Hakka restaurants like Frederick's around, but this one really tops them all.  The food isn't overly fried, so you will not be biting into chunks of oily, fried batter, but rather the meats are succulent and well-spiced. The portions are generous and they are meant to be shared.  Therefore, bring lots of friends and family members OR better yet pack up the leftovers for later. Just eat the food within the same day or the texture of many meats will change."}
{"text":"I like hakka Chinese. it is interesting because the whole story about in India and other regions with significant Indian populations, the locally known \"Hakka cuisine\" is actually an Indian adaptation of original Hakka dishes. This variation of Hakka cuisine is in reality, mostly Indian Taiwanese cuisine. It is called \"Hakka cuisine\" because in India many owners of restaurants that serve this cuisine are of Hakka origin. Typical dishes include 'chilli chicken' and 'Dong bei chow mein' (an Indianised version of real Dongbei cuisine), and these restaurants also serve traditional Indian dishes such as pakora.   I like it because it is Indian flavours in Chinese food. This place was pretty decent, I had the manchuria balls, and hakka noodles, i enjoyed eating it a lot, and might go here over Lucky Chinese which is farther and greasier."}
{"text":"Good waiter, friendly. Service was average. The food is so-so. I didn't enjoy the chicken much, but the fish was better. They do have a huge selection so it is possible that I chose the things that I didn't like, but both the items I chose had a \"star\" besides them which indicated a house specialty/famous item. Spacious restaurant and prices are good."}
{"text":"What to say .. WOW !! So fortunate to find another hidden gem from fellow Yelp reviewers. The menu selection is full of mouth watering dishes. Honestly I could have chosen a bevy of dishes.  The restaurant itself is spacious and has comfortable seating.  The Young Servers friendly and attentive. 5 Stars for the dishes we ordered. Soup:Hot and Sour Soup. Main: Bombay Tiger Prawns and Manchurian Chicken. For Dessert We had their deep fried banana w/honey and vanilla ice cream. (Which the cook changed the oil for and brought it back up to optimal temperature  ... Outstanding Service !!). Excellent!! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Hakka Chinese fare here. Smaller portions here compared to the Brampton location on Steeles but nicer plating and presentation. Usually have the Chilli Chicken Gravy or Black Pepper Beef. Have also had the fried chicken wings which were nice, batter wasn't too heavy. The food is consistent and tasty if you are looking for Hakka and/or something nice and spicy."}
{"text":"I order take out all the time and they put them in a big black container but this time I got them in half of the size I usually get. Did hakka no 1 cheap out and cut their portion size. Or is it because I use the 10%take out deal. Not sure if I would revisit them if I'm not fed properly due to the small portion size that they now change to for their take out box."}
{"text":"Would give 0 stars if it was an option. Whoever said this place was good obviously doesn't even know authentic hakka food. I was looking for a good place to try out near home and I found this place on the app, judging by the reviews I thought it would be good. I ordered pickup and bought chilli chicken, noodles, vegetables, chicken wings, beef and chicken fry rice almost 70 dollars for that. When I tried the food.. wasnt very tasty.. the fry rice was hard like stale rice , the chilli chicken which i was much excited to try was such a disappointment lack of seasoning , doesn't even taste like chilli chicken to be honest and they coat the chicken in a batter and fry it before cooking it into the sauce so your basically eating fried dough instead of chicken... nice way to cheap out on the meats. Definitely won't go back here again ! Horrible and expensive.   If you want the best hakka food in all of Scarborough I suggest going to Fredricks by Bellamy & ellesmere they've been there for years and no 1 can compare to their authentic hakka."}
{"text":"We ordered take out for a Saturday night family meal and it was disappointing.  We ordered chili chicken with gravy (so sad), ho fun with beef (doh!), medium sized hot and sour soup (too sweet), chicken wing appetizer (sigh...) and garlic stir fried bok choy (yay!).    I've always been a HUGE fan of chili chicken but have yet to find a really good option outside the downtown core (Yeh Tung still gets my vote.  10/10!).  Hakka No. 1's version was served up with salty gravy and dried out chicken pieces that screamed, \"I've been pre-cooked and sitting out for a while before I was made into this dish.\" Comparing it to my most recent chili chicken pick up from Fredericks (6/10 for Ellesmere location), this version was a solid 2/10 in the not very enjoyable category.    Beef ho fun received a sesame seed \"bomb\" treatment and it was just too bland and lacked any real flavour.  The beef they used were too chewy and tough, it made me wonder which cuts of \"beef\" they were using in the dish.  (3/10)  Hot and sour soup was so chunky which would normally not be a bad thing for me but this version had loads of imitation crab meat which made the soup sweeter than the way I like it.  (4/10)  Chicken wing appetizer donned heavier than preferred amount of batter but was a ok.  (5/10)  Garlic stir fried bok choy was the best dish of the night with over-blanched soft bok choy tips swimming in a garlicky stir fry sauce.  Normally, I prefer my veggies with more bite but for this dinner with the family (elderly and toddler), it was perfect.  The seasoning was spot on.  (8/10)  I don't think I'd venture out to Hakka no. 1 again.  It was one of those, 'once was enough' experiences.  Oh yes, and all this came to $54 and they give 10% discount if you pay cash."}
{"text":"It didn't feel like the most genuine Hakka menu, but it was still pretty good.  Staff: Friendly, nice and helpful. We did take out, but ordering was quick and so was the food.  Ambience: There is plenty of seating and tables, though it was a bit dark in terms of colour and lighting.  Food: I ordered the Black Bean Sauce Ho-Fun with Chicken. I found the sauce to be very thick and there was too much so I found it overwhelming. I'm used to a good balance, but the noodles were swimming in so much sauce and oil! Flavours were there, lots of veggies and noodles and chicken.  Overall, respectable but I wouldn't eat it often."}
{"text":"Not too impressed with Hakka No.1   Pretty expensive for the quantity they gave   we ordered Veggie Hakka Noodles with less oil  chili Chicken with gravy and Vegetable Pakoras  Hakka Noodles - super oily but tasted decent   Chili Chicken had a weird aftertaste   Veggie Pakoras were actually really good though"}
{"text":"I ordered flat rice noodles with beef. It was DARK but PALE in flavor, greasy, had eggs in it...who puts egg in ho fan noodles? The fact that there were only a few pieces meant it was left over from another dish....really disappointed. I couldn't even force myself to eat it and I was starving. No amount of hot sauce would fix this mess."}
{"text":"Extra happy about having this place so close to us. Haven't tried going there for lunch but the price seems right that I may be there tomorrow! It's not too spicy - but spicy enough. Bombay chicken is so good! And what made me really happy is that when we ordered take-out, they were very generous. I hope that keeps up. I hate places that make you pay a lot for so little. But this place seems fair for the price."}
{"text":"I have to appreciate that lunch goes until 4 p.m. . The food was okay and the quantity is plentiful. The quality, on the other hand, was just ok. Fish is fishy tasting... Shrimp is over breaded... Service it too laid back. The tables are never completely clean. Soy sauce always has an imprint.  What I totally love is the fish pakora! The sauce that comes with it is my favourite from any other Hakka restaurant! All lunch specials come with bottled water and a spring roll. They have a huge selection also."}
{"text":"The Chinese workers here do not smile or even say please or thank you. Even when you tell them thank you, they don't say you're welcome.  They have this weird policy that they only give fortune cookies to people dining in. So even if you spend like $50 or more with them on take out, they wont spare not even one fortune cookie. I want to know my damn Fortune!  They have this tiny ass bathroom with two stalls and little space for movement.  The chicken wings are beautifully light and crispy. They're tasty too. I'll give them that.  The sesame chicken is like a sweet flavor and so is the crispy ginger chicken. They were tasty enough. I don't know why, but their portions are 25% smaller than most hakka places with the same price.  The chicken on top of the Guyanese chow mein was dry as hell. It's like they had three day old chicken on the verge of spoiling and fried it to rid of the spoiled taste and threw it on top of the chow mein.  I can only recommend the chicken wings with confidence  at this point.  I would recommend this place because it's basically the only hakka spot in this area... but someone please call em out on their salty customer service."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner with a big craving for hood Hakka. The restaurant was completely empty except for some take out customers. It seemed like they were short staffed. Under the tables were leftover food and utensils from other customers. The restaurant was freezing like they didn't want to pay the heat bill. I gave it 4 stars because the majority of the food was great. Spicy shrimp on their appetizer list is amazing. General Tao is highly recommended. Singapore noodles were great but we got it with beef which was probably a bad choice. Chilli chicken was a little blah. Food came out hot and fast. I would give it another try if I end up in the area again."}
{"text":"4/5: Service charges were added for no good reason & tables were kinda sticky.   Came in with a group of 7 people for lunch. We all have had many types of Hakka around the Scarborough/East York area and thought we'd try a new spot.   When we walked in we weren't \"impressed\" or disappointed. Very plain spot with no ambiance or flow of decor... Maybe it's just in my mind.   We all ordered lunch specials (I have a picture posted for chilli chicken) and they were huge! Big portions that came with an egg roll & water. All of them were about $7-9CAD Ea. Also had a large corn soup to share between all of us.   Now the service charge thing... In my mind I feel a service charge is added to a table because you have to take care of \"X\" amount of people right? Well our sever didn't serve us our soups (pour in bowls) or didn't even care to see what entree he was putting where. Now of course a service charge isn't a considerable amount of money but still if you're gonna charge a \"party\" for doing it you should do it, right?"}
