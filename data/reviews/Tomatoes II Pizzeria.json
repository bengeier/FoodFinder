{"text":"Italian hoagie, no capicola, asked for banana peppers there were 5 of them on the whole hoagie. Basically ham cheese and bun. Overpriced and under flavored. I can't believe I gave them a 1.85 tip to pick this up. One and done."}
{"text":"Got 3 pizzas and antipasto salad delivered and it was excellent. The best part was the delivery guy was the most pleasant delivery person I've ever met. Food tastes better when the people who bring it to you are happy!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Ordered an XL chicken and spinach pizza with white sauce and was not disappointed. The pizza was everything I thought it would be. Huge pieces of chicken, crumbled bacon, wilted spinach, all covered with gooey melty cheese. 

Service was amazing. Ordered the XL online and when the driver showed up he informed me they had ran out of XL dough balls so they brought a large and a small! You don't see customer service like that very often anymore. 

All in all very satisfied 10/10 customer service and food quality both greatly exceeded my expectations. I will definitely be ordering from Tomatoes II again!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best marinara I've ever had. We ordered the meat lovers pizza and the toppings were high quality and quantity. The cheese sticks were outstanding of course with that marinara sauce. Garlic parmesan fries were also on point. Only disappointment was the super long delivery time. Would definitely eat there again but probably dine in rather than wait on delivery."}
{"text":"Tonight I placed an order for delivery with Josh. A simple order with an additional request for a side. Typically, I have been disappointed by local shops in time for the delivery and order miscues. However, I was beyond satisfied with what unfolded! My order arrived far earlier than expected, the order was correct to perfection and the delivery was made by Josh whom I placed the order with personally. He made cordial conversation describing the personal reflection that he and his family have placed into their operations, gave me the understanding of how much they believe in their philosophy. They have a new customer! Proudly!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza place in town. We get the steak and cheese sub and have tried pretty much everything else too.  Love the wings! Super awesome people. And great food."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Fresh ingredients! Grilled Chicken Salad, Appetizer Sampler Platter and Meat Lover's Pizza! Used the delivery app and it was great! Delivery man was polite and fast!"}
{"text":"The stars are for the wings and the delivery service. The driver was very nice and thanked us at least 10 times for ordering from them. I wish I liked it better.
The wings..although mild should be called hot..were delish. The Philly cheese steak had very little cheese or steak and the pizza was not good.  I would definitely order again if I was only in the mood for wings."}
{"text":"We got a medium four cheese Pizza and an order of breadsticks. We loved the breadsticks but the Pizza was amazing. The staff is very friendly and courteous. Highly recommended this place. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've never been to the restaurant, but I've ordered their food almost every week for the past two months. Delivery times vary, it's usually fast (less than an hour, usually 30-45 minutes), but there was a time it was almost a 2 hour wait. That said.... the food and prices are so good I couldn't even get mad enough to discontinue business.

The food is absolutely delicious! I love, love, LOVE their pizza. It's got some kind of spice going on that makes it different from every other pizza joint in Pittsburgh and keeps me coming back. The wings are pretty generous, the Cesar chicken wrap is delicious, and the hoagies never disappoint. But the French fries? They're the best. Greasey with real cheese, not cheese sauce, on top. 

You can tell the ingredients are fresh, and the food is well crafted."}
{"text":"Just got my first and most certainly last delivery from here. The gyro consisted of slimy lettuce and gyro meat that was dry and tasteless. The chicken Caesar wrap wasn't that good either. The wrap itself was stale, and overall it was a sloppy runny mess. Everything was cold, and was generally on par with something cooked in the microwave 30 mins before it got to my door. Oh and let's not forget no cucumber sauce or marinara (or other dipping sauce for that matter) to dip the poppers and fried mushrooms in. Maybe this was an isolated incident, but with not a single redeeming thing about the entire order, I feel I cannot trust this place go try them again...."}
{"text":"I have to say that not only is the food amazing, the employees are extremely friendly. They went as far to fulfill my request to draw John Snow from Game of Thrones (easily the best pizza place EVER!) Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Great customer service awesome tasting food I would recommend to anyone!! Awesome staff nicest people you can ask for!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in a long time; and I have pizza every Friday. 
Fresh hand tossed dough and delicious sauce. We ate in but delivery available. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Chose this place because it was close and they had a good selection on the menu.  I ordered a chicken salad and my boyfriend got a buffalo chicken sub. Both were delicious! Their prices seemed pretty good for the size too. We used online delivery, which was easy, but it might have been faster to just pick it up in store."}
{"text":"One star is for prompt delivery.   Otherwise, the food was awful. I ordered a small supreme pizza and 6 wings. The pizza crust was not fully cooked. The pizza sauce was barely there and had almost no flavor. They toppings used were as cheap as you could possibly get. I have never had a pizza the taste is so much like nothing. They also did not honor my request for no olives.

Disappointed, I decided to try the wings. When I open the box the wings were sitting in a third of an inch of oil. They were over saturated in oil and unpalatable.

I was excited to try a new place that had good reviews. I was shocked with how bad the food was. I will not be going there again."}
{"text":"Great pizza and hoagies with fresh toppings. Quick and convenient. Service is excellent"}
{"text":"Have ordered from here a few times and it's always been good. Chicken bacon ranch pizza is delicious!"}
{"text":"I placed a order through grubhub. I received a call from staff stating that they did not have chicken wings as they cannot find a distributor who has them available for order. The man who called me back was very kind and offered me a hoagie to replace the wings. I told him I would have to call back as my gf was the one who wanted the wings. After I confirmed with her I called back. I had asked for two appetizers. They did not have popcorn chicken as that was another item they could not order. I did not complain and understood. They let me order 3 appetizers and continued to apologize when they arrived to my house with the order. This was the first time I ordered from here and I will again. Food and customer service skills were on point"}
{"text":"Fresh garlic knots are crazy good and a reason to keep coming back.  Online ordering is real easy. Delivery is nice and staff courteous. No papers to sign. Food is packaged nicely."}
{"text":"Ok first: I ordered through Grub hub. Amazing! Second: I've never had tomatoes ll pizza. From the moment the delivery driver handed it to me, all the way to my kitchen counter, it smelled AMAZING! I opened the box and to my surprise it's real cheese! Not crappy oily fake cheese. Real cheese! I take a bite and it was as if the Pizza Gods were smiling upon me. I said, with a mouth full of pizza goodness, \"I need to leave a raving crazy mad super fan review\"!
Third: By Zeus's beard this Pizza is amazing! Pepperoni and a Margarita pizzas. #getinmybelly 
Fourth: why are you still reading this?! Go get one! Or two!"}
{"text":"They really are serving the best pizza in town, all of their portions are generous to say at the least. The wings are giant and crispy, the pizza dough is sweet and delectable. My favorite item would have to be the Italian sub, way more meat and cheese than you'll find on any subway sandwich. It's also a Pittsburgh family owned pizzeria and you can tell they use genuine fresh food. Won't ever stop coming here absolutely love it."}
{"text":"The best pizza around!  It's their sauce that makes the pizza so awesome, it tastes like homemade. We order food from here often and everything we've had, we've enjoyed. There was a problem with our most recent order. I called and spoke to the manager. He was very apologetic, replaced our pizza, and gave us 10% off our next order. We will continue to order here every time we get pizza."}
{"text":"I can only speak to the pizza but it's really good here! I like using the delivery app and the driver was right on time, very friendly. Their crust is delicious it has some sort of garlic butter cooked into it. Yum!"}
{"text":"I'm relatively new to Carnegie, so I've been on the hunt for great delivery. I've found the place with Tomatoes II. For starters, they are friendly and thank me for my business every time I call. And beyond that, the food is delicious. I highly recommend the Supremo pizza. The combo of toppings is perfect, and I especially enjoy the pepperoni. It's crisped a little from the oven, rather than collecting grease, which I love. Thanks to great food and service, Tomatoes II has a happy customer with me."}
{"text":"This place has been my go-to since I started Living in Carnegie. Can't tell you how many times I've ordered from them. All the menu options are great, I usually spring for the garlic knots every time! The staff is very polite, and personable. Always delivers faster than they say they will."}
{"text":"Got delivery for my hotel and it took a while, therefore it was not fresh --- the wings were pretty good and I could tell the Pizza would have been good had I been at the place live.  Oh Well --- at least I didnt have to fight the traffic and I got to watch New Girl on netflix while I ate."}
{"text":"I ordered a sausage calzone today and asked for a side is sauce (didn't get sauce). Order came promptly and driver was extremely nice! Calzone was small, burnt and so soggy I simply took a bite and trashed it. Very disappointed as a new resident to the community."}
{"text":"Men who work there called me sweetheart and honey, and they don't make their own crust. Not a pleasant experience"}
{"text":"This was a good, solid pizza. I am not a huge fan of that standard doughy pizza (think Vocelli's, Domino's) so that's why it doesn't get five stars. I prefer a thinner, more New York style pizza, but again, it's simply personal choice here.

That being said, this pizza had an excellent sauce with a subtle spice to it that really made it stand out. If I was ordering for a large group I'd go with this pizza place because I'm sure that it would please everyone. 

Also got a wedgie, that uniquely Pittsburgh mix between a calzone and a hoagie, and it was delicious. Definitely one of the better wedgies I've ever had.

Lastly, the delivery man was exceptionally nice. I didn't believe it from the reviews (after all, how can all of these people be getting the same GrubHub/Yelp guy) but Tomatoes II sends their own delivery person out for those orders as well, and he really is the kindest delivery person ever."}
{"text":"We live in Collier Township, and Tomatoes II and Serafina's are our go-to pizza and pasta delivery services. I prefer Tomatoes II's pasta over Serafina's, because all their pastas are home-made fresh. As they're made fresh, sometimes the wait can be a bit longer, but I don't mind the wait knowing that I'll be dining on a home-made style dinner. The service and staff are always super nice. You should check this place out next time you don't feel like cooking!"}
{"text":"Omg so freaking delicious! I order delivery which came really fast & the driver was really nice. It was my 1st time eating from here & they didn't disappoint! The steak hoagie was the best I had in a long while & the meat pizza so so good! I was full from the half hoagie but wanted to try the pizza in just yes yes yummy. I will most definitely be ordering again & recommending this place."}
{"text":"Best five cheese pizza in Pittsburgh!!! The white sauce & feta are scrumptious!! We love the delivery gentleman even more!!!"}
{"text":"There are times that warrant a review for customer service alone. This is that time. Not only was the service on point, the driver was the nicest man I think I've EVER MET and thanked me multiple times for my business. Points for gracious service. Extra points for super-fast delivery.

The food deserves recognition all its own. I didn't know the white pizza came with olives because I didn't read the menu but I was NOT SAD about them. It was delish. The breadsticks are to die for and the marinara has some kind of spice/heat to it that I've never had anywhere else. It really is the perfect balance of sweet/savory/spice and will have me going back for more. 

5 stars and a happy customer. I shall return."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for the first time last Friday -- pizza & hoagie. DELICIOUS!!!  I will definitely be a regular!  AMPLE portions and fabulous taste!"}
{"text":"Horrible pizza!! Don't waste your money. So many other places that are much better. I can't see how other people gave this 4 stars????"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza deliveries in the south hills. We ordered the spinach and feta pizza with white sauce and enjoyed it. What exceeded our expectations was the breaded zucchini planks and hot pepper cheese balls. Typically by the time it's delivered to your house, deep fried appetizers tend to lose their crispness and become soft but not Tomatoes! Our zucchini planks and cheese balls arrived super crisp and hot just like if would have been dining in. Big thumbs up for figuring that out!"}
{"text":"This is the first time that I've ever eaten their food and it was great. Really good pizza and a good Italian hoagie. I like that they put the Italian dressing on the side and they even wrap it in aluminum foil to prevent leakage.

I got delivery and I have to give the delivery guy a shout. He was probably one of the friendliest and most professional delivery guys that I've ever run into. 

I ordered off of Yelp, which I won't anymore since the delivery guy passed me a coupon to order direct off of their website. Yelp said that it would be about 40 minutes for delivery and my food came in 20.  


Definitely give them a try."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, wings and hoagies! They also have amazing customer service. I haven't seen such service since I lived out of state. Very impressed!"}
{"text":"I get takeout from Tomatoes II all the time.   The crust is on the softer side and is quite yummy.  I usually get medium size pizza to avoid a case of the droopies (is that a word - spell check say \"no\").   I just don't like droopy pizza.

My go-to favorites are the meat and taco.   The meat pizza is as you would expect, a carnivore's dream.  The taco pizza is topped with taco meat, cheddar cheese, followed by crushed tortilla chips, fresh  lettuce, and tomato.   The chips provide a texture change which I really like.

Small Pizza base price is under $10 so you can get a really good pizza at a great price.  Delivery is fast if you are in the area."}
{"text":"The worst customer services! Tired to order a pizza and the sent the wrong pizza. I called the manger and they hung up twice! He called blamed us but I have proof my order! They didn't offer to help and refused to accept their mistake. They yelled. And I will never again go there. So many other pizza places that care about you and your order. Safe your money!"}
{"text":"Great Food - love the meatball hoagie, pizza, and calzones!  Great ownership!"}
{"text":"The cinnamon puffs were very good but the main course of chicken tenders and fries was literally the worst delivery food I've ever experienced. Like burnt cardboard. I can't believe they think they can even pass this off as a form of food at all. Add to that the delivery guy called me honey and sweetie. Just bag this place. Total culinary fail."}
{"text":"I do have to say it was delicious, great pie, delivery was on time would definitely order again!"}
{"text":"My go to delivery when I'm just not in the mood for cooking. They make everything easy when deciding and ask all the right questions if I forgot something. I typically do their game time combo and it's a large pizza, whole sub, wings, and soda for under $30! This feeds me for about 4 days and man oh man is it delicious! Steak sub is always toasted fresh and perfect in flavor.... nice crust to topping ratio on the pizza which is what I enjoy, and the wings are always fully coated in the flavoring i picked which I'm personally a stickler for so I like that aspect!"}
{"text":"We eat at tomatoes pizza at least once a week.  It is my families, favorite pizza in Pittsburgh.  The staff is friendly and our order is always right.   Their subs are pretty good too.  If you're looking for a new pizza place, give tomatoes a try.  You'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"Ordered via Eat24 for pick-up and found that our pizza was on time and still looked fresh out of the oven.

We went for the chicken and spinach which also came with thinly sliced tomatoes and bacon. We also subbed white sauce since it seemed more apt for these toppings...

Great choice! Toppings weren't very heavy handed but we still found the flavors spot on. In regards to service, we found the staff to be very friendly when we walked in. When we asked for a few plates, the lady behind the counter neatly bagged us a few heavy duty plates and napkins. I actually only expected a few paper plates to be handed to me.

The only thing that could have been better was if the crust was just a bit more crisp."}
{"text":"Wings are not as I wanted from my special instructions from grubhub.com. Asked for extra crispy. No way to buy 30 wings for 18.00 like other wings shops. Ate half then the next day had to put in the oven. This was the second time. So will allow more time to cook if ordered again."}
{"text":"Their pizza is mouth watering! I would definitely recommend this place to everybody and I really like there margarita pizza , it has the perfect flavor and is cooked well , I also personally know the owner and he is very sweet and kind"}
{"text":"I found Tomatoes II on Eat 24. I never heard if it, but the reviews convinced me to try. 

The pizza was amazing. It arrive hot, which is hard for a 15 minute delivery. The sauce is what makes this pizza awesome. I have a thing for breadsticks, and their breadsticks are good, but the sauce...

Did I mention the marinara sauce? It. Is. So. Good. 

I'm hooked, and there is a big menu I can't wait to try."}
{"text":"Our families go to pizza place! We have only enjoyed delivery but are never disappointed! My all time fav is the cheese steak pizza with the white sauce! But let's be honest it's the best pizza place that delivers to dormont!"}
{"text":"Ordered the supreme pizza with a side of wings- both are amazing. Crust is delicious, the ingredients are fresh, and the wings are superb! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Just bought 2 gyro's here for lunch. They were a absolute worst gyros my husband and I have ever had. The pita was thick and doughy. The lamb was cold. I actually think the forgot to cook them. All I can say, if you're looking for a good lunch in Carnegie, move on, 'cause this joint ain't it."}
{"text":"Second Sunday we've ordered from here. After moving into the Waterford apartments we'd been trying to find good delivery and I think we find it! The delivery service is amazing. Can't get over how nice the delivery man was. Best service I've ever had. And the margarita pizza was beautiful just as he said. We're definitely making this our new Sunday pizza place! Thanks so much!!"}
{"text":"This place is always timely and the pizza is great just as I ordered! The man that delivers it is beyond kind. That's how service should be! You won't be disappointed with this place!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The wings are great, the hoagies are great, the salads are great, and the delivery is always on time and super friendly.

The wings are probably the best I've had of their type. They are pretty heavily breaded and fried (some like naked wings- these are not them!) and we got bourbon flavor and it was awesome.

The salads are always fresh with a good amount of toppings and dressing. I like the popcorn chicken salad.

My only reason for four stars and not five is the pizza. It's just not my favorite and for whatever reason seems to be undercooked. I like a doughy pizza, but this takes squishy to a new level. It TASTES okay, so if I order more I'd just ask for it to be well done.

The manager (owner maybe?) has delivered to our house on occasion, and he is the sweetest man with the best customer service. Glad a place like this delivers to my area!!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from Tomatoes II many times since moving to Carnegie a year and a half ago. Always very friendly service and delicious food! Tomatoes II never disappoints!"}
{"text":"The customer service is fantastic and the food is delicious. I just found my new favorite pizza place!"}
{"text":"Living in Scott Twp for the last 12 years and finally have found a great pizza joint. The pizza is the perfect balance of cheese and sauce. The crust doughy and delicious. I also ordered a garden salad and was pleasantly surprised at the size, freshness and variety of veggies/accoutrements on it. Hands down, best pizza place in the area!!"}
