{"text":"Met friends for dinner on the Ridgewood patio last night.  It's really nice back there.  The staff was very friendly and efficient.  I tried the fish & chips and my wife had the fish sandwich.  Both were very good and you can't beat a draught Guinness for $4 (happy hour price).  We definitely plan to return."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise in a little strip mall. The decor is very classy and includes hand-crafted wood designs. The food matches the level of the design. Very innovative, and high quality. Staff is friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Amber was great! Nick was awesome! Beautiful outdoor patio.  Pickle martini was spectacular as well as my Mexican Moscow Mule made with patron. House made dressings were to die for- loved the house and ranch. My boyfriend ordered the Caesar salad and it was was amazing too. Can't forget about our BBQ chicken Pizza! Bomb DOT COM! Thanks again guys!!"}
{"text":"Very nice decor.  Good service and the food was good.  Only negative was it was a little pricey."}
{"text":"I'm going to do something I rarely do & give Ridgewood Kitchen & Spirits five stars based solely on service. I am so tired of servers who are either pretentious (I'll be taking care of you this evening), want to be your friend (Let me sit down next to you while I take your order), foreign spies-in-training (I'm going to memorize each order for this party of 8 instead of writing it down), or just don't give a damn.  The food was good, the prices OK, & the decor was nice. But the service was quick, courteous, & attentive; a rare trifecta in this day & age. The same is true of the other servers working this evening because they also stopped at our table to check on us. None of that \"Sorry, not my section\" BS. The manager also stopped at our table. Remember when managers used to do that? It's been YEARS since I've experienced a restaurant manager doing that!  So go to Ridgewood Kitchen & Spirits for the service & stay for the food. ________  If you've read to this point, help keep me motivated by casting a vote for my review. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great improvements from beach club. The renovation is pretty. Our server was great! The food was wonderful. Nice addition to concord. The chicken sliders were delicious. Fish and Chips was a huge portion."}
{"text":"Really enjoy coming to Ridgewood since the new owners and renovations. It's much cleaner and smells better. I love the bright but warm environment. The manager is fantastic. He's very personable and cares about the customers full experience. He jumps in to assist his staff but the service is attentive as well.   The bar offers vast selections of beer, wine and liquors. The menu is decent bar food and I can't wait to taste more. Everything I've had so far has been fresh and priced well. My favorite is the fresh cut truffle fries with this goat cheese dip that I lick the bowl for every last bit! I can't help but order them every time I go."}
{"text":"Nice little place in a plaza, wasn't busy at all on a Friday night. Calamari was okay. The chicken and biscuit sliders were eh. The biscuits would not hold together so I ate it with a fork. The fried chicken was tasty. Friend got the portabella sandwich and loved it."}
