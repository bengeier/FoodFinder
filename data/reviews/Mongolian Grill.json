{"text":"Fine but wouldn't return. I went here with some girlfriends because one of them talked it up.  Buffet style, can pick anything to add into your bowl.  To expensive. I have a small stomach; I don't really eat much, for one bowl was still in the twenties price range. For a feast dinner (as many bowls as your tummy wants) is only a few dollars more than one bowl. Basically a rip off if you have a little tummy like me. Food was just fine.  Staff was fine. We had bowls piled up. ALL servers were together chatting. Didn't come to ask how it was or if we needed anything else.  No thank you bye."}
{"text":"Worst Asian food ever. If you like bland food at high prices by all means waste your food and money here. Our group of 6 decided mid meal to cut our losses and go to Denny's instead. We should have known better."}
{"text":"Location: In the Whitby Entertainment Centrum, ample parking space. The entrance is on the opposite side of the lot. Kind of an awkward place to get to.  Facility: Dated and small. Not much to say in terms of atmosphere and decor. If you've been to other Mongolian Grills in Toronto, you'll be very disappointed.  Food Quality & Price: $22 per person for all you can eat dinner. Do yourself a favour, drive down the 401, pay $3 more to go to the Genghis Khan Mongolian Grill. Skip this joke.  On the table, you get white rice and ... tortilla shells?! Wtf? Okay. Go up to the grill, you can't mix meats... okay, never heard of that rule. Selection is quite sparse. Includes lots of pasta, though. Sauces and spices left a lot to be desired, very underwhelming.   Alright, let's check out the appetizer bar. Where is it? Oh, just outside the washrooms... in the corner. Oh look, the creole soup and tomato ravioli is all canned quality and full of sodium.  Enjoy the wiff of the toilets as you go by. The salad bar looks like its been sitting there for days. No thanks. I don't want to get food poisoning.  Service: Wait staff were great. Friendly and chatty. No particularly fast or anything. Good enough. The \"chefs\" are like 20-something kids who look like they're working a fast food joint. No water is added to the heat, no showmanship, no mixing of meats. They were nice, though and greeted every patron with a smile.  Overall: Just a completely westernized version of \"Mongolian\". It's really just the Manchu-Wok of Mongolian Grills. They took the concept and made it just laughable. Came by invitation of friends that live in Whitby - LOL nice of them, but never again."}
{"text":"We've been eating here for years and have always loved the food. Our kids will eat here without complaints which is kind of rare for them anywhere outside of McDonalds!! The ambiance isn't the greatest and the service is somewhat lacking. This past visit we wanted to confirm how we would be charged for our 8 year old and 5 year old. We were originally told $9.95 each which didn't make me happy because neither of them eat a quantity of food to justify that price. The server reconfirmed for us that it would be $6.95 for our 8 year old and $2.50 for our 5 year old. I was much happier with that price based on what my kids can eat. We will definitely be back many more times!!"}
{"text":"The worst!!!! We only went to the Mongolian Grill in Whitby because every other place had a 1/2 hour wait, and I'd been to the MG on Don Mills many times. Let me just sy the MG on Don Mills and the one in Whitby are completely different. Don Mills has a full buffet, nice big bowls and CLEAN grill. The Whitby one... dirty disgusting grill, tiny little bowls, no buffet but the price was the same. And like the poster before me my meat was pulverized beyond recognition. Wraps?? Why? I was actually glad we managed to escape without a raging case of food poisoning. My favourite part was the tip jars at the grill... classy. I wish I could give this place negative stars."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about how bad this was.  I could pull a better \"salad bar\" out of my refrigerator without going to the store first. The selection of veggies for the stir fry was ok (pretty sure everything's straight out of a bag) and the sauces were pretty bland.  Guess we should have figured it out when we walked in and the place was nearly empty.  No way this was worth $45 for two people who only drank water."}
{"text":"Fabulous!  Love this place!  If you love stir fry, this is your place!  Pick your own ingredients and they cook it right in front of you.  If you just want one bowl, great - pay for one.  If you want more than one, go for the feast and it is endless.  Even when the place is packed, their system of cooking works well and is efficient."}
{"text":"Gross This has an All-You-can-eat buffet of mounds of noodles, meat, vegetables of all kinds, and soup. Its not all that great, and just about none of it is recognizable as Mongolian cuisine, no dumplings, horse or mutton  They serve all kinds of random crap, including a fair bit of mexican food, your \"mongolian grill\" bowl can have salsa, sour cream, pico de gallo - since I presume thats what Americans expect from ethnic food. I observed a number of seriously fat people at the restaurant, who are obviously drawn in by the All-you-can-eat.  I'd be up for trying Khorkog, but I would not go back here."}
{"text":"It's 25 bucks for a bowl of warm and noodly. That's it. The choices suck, the salad bar sucks, the desserts are good, the drinks are expensive and the novelty wears off instantly."}
{"text":"The food is always really good and they accommodated my mom's seafood allergy phenomenally but they had a lot of issues with their hostesses and servers.  When we arrived the hostess got our name and said a 10 minute wait, but there was a group who had arrived before us and they were not given a time and were not asked their names for the list so that they would be sat first. When we went to be seated, we had to tell the hostess that this family had been waiting before we arrived and they should be sat first. She was incredibly rude to us about this situation and then was rude to the family like it was their fault they had to wait.  Afterwards when we got our food we noticed that the same hostess had moved a family's belongings while they were getting food and had sat someone in their seats. The family had 2 small children with them who were confused as to where their things went as well as why they couldn't sit down and eat. The two hostesses ended up getting into an argument which made for an uncomfortable dining experience for anyone who saw what had happened.  I enjoyed the food at Mongolian Grill but I do not think I will be returning to this location any time soon."}
{"text":"It's definitely not authentic Mongolian. Lets start with that. It is a Western Stir Fry AYCE.  This place is located in a plaza with a movie theatre in Whitby, tons of parking so that was nice. There are also a ton of other places you can eat at in this plaza.  Came on a Wednesday night, the place was pretty dead, only one waiter waiting on tables but that was all they needed. The place did not look Mongolian at all so you wanted a Mongolian Grill experience this is not a place I would recommend. We came here because it was close to my friend and I didn't feel like pub food so I said why not.   They have the meal and feast option. Meal is one stir fry bowl or a feast is all you can eat for an extra $4. But the price of a meal was already $19 (which is not all that cheap considering...) The meal includes a salad, soup, and one stir fry. I loaded up my salad bowl was pretty much everything so I had enough to take home (because I like to make my dinner in lunch for the next day). The soup did not look appetizing to me... Salad bar was standard, they had one mix, 6 dressings, macaroni salad, potato salad, beets, pickles nothing mongolian once again.   Now the stir fry, we were told not to mix meat due to cooking time (which I understand, but that's also how they get you go for seconds!). But I mix sausage with pork because meh. The selection was not amazing, standard. Noodles with vegetables and an array of sauces and spices. The grilling part was quick because it was a slow night. The taste of everything at the end was once again meh. They gave us rice and tortillas, not sure why there were tortillas....but sure? I put some of my stir fry in the tortillas and not mad about it. Got my carbs in for the night LOL  This place is pretty much a Western version of stir fry. Overpriced. Would not return. Rather eat at a real Mongolian grill for that price.   The waiter was really nice though"}
{"text":"An entertaining novelty with poor service, but quality food.  I've been here about 6-8 times now, and always this location, although I am sure their are locations.  Mongolian Grill all but cries out that it is a chain restaurant.  Like the other reviews explained, you sit, order a drink, have a salad and/or soup, then go fill up a bowl of raw meat, vegetables, sauces and spices before giving it to the cooks as they prepare it in front of you with cooking swords.  When you return to your table,  a bowl of steamed white rice and flour tortillas will be waiting for you.  You have the choice of a meal (once) or a feast (unlimited visits to the grill).  I think the difference in price is about $3.00, although I always fill my initial bowl to the very top, I have never needed the feast.  The restaurant is not very big, and the staff tries to keep from opening the 2nd floor whenever possible, even if there is a wait at the front door, which is very inconvenient in the winter time.  VERY COLD!  The staff has always been friendly, but all they really do is bring you drinks, clear your plates, and bring you your bill, and it always seems that they are either too slow, or too understaffed.  Either way it has been a problem.  Earlier I mentioned that I have never had the \"feast\", just the \"meal\", yet I always seem to get charged for a \"feast\", so my biggest tip is to MAKE SURE YOU CHECK YOUR BILL.  Don't get charged for the wrong order.  Even though I love the food, and the ability to create and fine-tune my own dish, the service is not good enough.  I return because of the food, but unfortunately I know what I am getting myself into in regards to the service.  I'm curious to hear your responses on the service.  Is it just bad luck on my part?

{"text":"Love this place! I always go for semi special occasions like birthdays. Great food. Friendly service. I recommend to everyone. Could be better located."}
{"text":"Service really needs to improve here, as for the general cleanliness of the place. I also am not a fan of such concepts given that I credit chefs with the cuisine, whereas here it falls entirely up to you. Granted there are suggestions on the wall, which I did try. In terms of the food... Quantity was a disappointment. I had to opt for the feast rather than the meal, with unlimited bowls. The tortilla could have been cooked just a tad more. All in all, I give it the stars only because of the unique experience. Other than that, I'd much prefer fire and ice in Markham."}
{"text":"Big fan of the restaurant. Always enjoy new dining experiences and this is a great one for small groups."}
{"text":"Expensive Stir fry.  Food was okay, but nothing special.  More atmosphere rather and good eating.  Definitely worth going to once to experience."}
{"text":"Great concept for a restaurant experience. Thoroughly enjoyed the food and the experience!"}
{"text":"This is not fine dining or great food ... Its dining entertainment.  You are the chef as you fill your bowl with with veggies and raw meats then hand it to the kids who move it around with wooden sticks on a giant circular flattop grill. (btw- am I the only one who wonders about raw meat out with the public...)  While it is kinda fun to do, its not an ideal way to cook stirfry if you really want some depth of flavour, control the doneness of veggies or avoid burnt garlic etc.   Even with the large variety of sauces and spices available everything seems to taste the same or becomes dominated with spice or is a mix of cooked, undercooked, overcooked or burned.  For $18 pp at dinner I would rather have something prepared by a chef (or a line cook)  in a logical order with care and enjoy it,  rather than charred food slapped around with hockey sticks by minimum wage high school kids.  Is it fun and worth a chance?  - Yes but go for lunch and save some time and $  Is it worth going back to? Not really but everyone has different standards on food and it's preparation.."}
{"text":"You fill your bowl with anything you want, that is good thing to do ans try as you always experience with new mixes. The only thing is that you need to know what sauces to add to make it good."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place when we started going there but over time after they got an established clientele things have gone to the shitter. It went from the service being excellent and on the ball with drink refills etc to never getting any refills and the waitstaff make you feel like you're bothering them to do their jobs. One time we ordered a cheese pizza off the kids menu and didn't get it for 35 minutes. We were all eating off the grill and my son waited and waited, when the waitress was asked about it she was like OMG I FORGOT. Well OMG you didn't get a $20 tip. I haven't been or plan on being back again..I'd rather watch 2 dogs fuck in the parking lot than eat there again"}
{"text":"Out of the different Mongolian Grill's peppered around the GTA, all of which offer a different style, this one is my favourite. This restaurant is in a chain of Mongolian Grills with a J.B.'s in front of it. The difference from the Kahn Grills in Markham and Toronto is that this one doesn't have an Asian flair to it. I was thinking about what they have on their menu, and although they do have one, I don't think I've ever looked at it because everyone who goes there gets the buffet. For those who don't know, the setup of the place is to go up to the buffet, put in a bunch of raw meats, vegetables, sauces, and spices, give it to the cook who cooks it on this huge flat top grill, and in a few mins gives you a cooked meal. What makes it so awesome is that there are a wide variety of sauces and spices, so there are a plethora of possible meal combinations. The tastes of the meals can vary, depending on the consistency of building your bowls and how long the cooks cook the food (sometimes they cook it too long drying out the food). There is few selections of AYCE establishments if you don't want Japanese or Chinese. Dinner time at this place can get rammed, and may be a little frustrating when you build your bowl and have to wait in line to get it cooked. This is why I go around 3 on a Saturday; they have the exact same menu, its pretty dead, and instead of paying $20 for AYCE, its $14. There is also the option of only going up once and paying a much less price."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place, me and my daughters are usually there every Tuesday, it's our girls night and we choose to dine here. I like the fact that all the food is fresh, and you get to choose what goes into your dish, and it gets cooked right in front of you. You get a variety of meats you can choose from, a variety of veggies and a good variety of sauces. Then at the end are your choice of spices. It's a great experience and very decently priced. The staff is pleasant and friendly."}
