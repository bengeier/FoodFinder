{"text":"Amazing authentic Mexican food- a nice change from the stayed taco focus in Toronto right now. The portions are very generous and well priced, and the staff are lovely. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We had the most amazing food and the warmest service. We came to el rinconcito for a team dinner and felt like family. We were personally served by mom and pop. And each plate felt and tasted especially made for each one of us.  We plan on making it a weekly event for the length of the project.  Amazing and traditional. Beautiful food and beautiful people."}
{"text":"We went there on Friday night to celebrate cinco de mayo and were extremely disappointed.  When we arrived,  the server said they were full so it may be a bit of a wait for at able.  We pointed to an empty table which he didn't notice and he then said he would get it cleaned and seat us. While waiting to be seated,  I used the washroom which was probably the nastiest washroom I've ever been in at a sit down restaurant. The condition of the washroom made me wonder about the cleanliness of the rest of the restaurant not visible to the public.  After I returned from the washroom,  the table was cleaned,  but we continued to wait to be seated. .. someone then came over after about 5 additional minutes and simply pointed to the table and did not formally seat us or hand us a menu to look at while we waited to be attended to.  We sat at the table for about 10 minutes without being greeted,  offered water or drinks,  or provided with a menu to browse.  It was at this point we made the decision to simply get up and leave.  We had plenty of time to dine and enjoy drinks,  and all it would have taken is a simple getting from someone and we would have stayed.  Instead,  we could tell that our business was not important to them so we spent our money on dinner,  drinks,  and dessert at a restaurant that welcomed our business."}
{"text":"Guacala de pollo paisanos!  Hoy comi en este lugar y me arrepiento profundamente! Para empezar el menu no tiene nada de mexicano pero ademas es muy malo. Really really bad!!  The worst mexican in Toronto! I wish I could give them zero stars!"}
{"text":"Service was very kind and fast. The food was authentic! I had the \"Tacos de carnitas\". I recommend!!!  They have delicious (and cheap) lunch specials."}
{"text":"Gross food, the best part was the free chips and salsa. Waste of time and money. The place was empty and the price tag for a 3 tacos was dry steak, dry chicken and dry pork."}
{"text":"If my abuela wanted to get a fast divorce divorce from grandpa, she would cook for him like these amigos.  Disgusting washroom and cheap decor. For a moment I thought I was in the Jane-Finch area."}
{"text":"Soggy fried food. All the fried food tasted fishy. Very bland chicken. This place is in the middle of many office buildings, and beside our table was completely empty through the lunch period. I will never be returning. $3 for 200ml of soda. Hahahahahhahaha nope."}
{"text":"Decided to check out this place for lunch today with a work colleague. The food and service was great overall. The server was friendly and gave us some chips with pico de gallo while we waited for the signature special chicken chimichangas. The chimichanga is one of 5 (I think?) $10 lunch specials and is served with salad and refried beans. The chicken was tender and the tortillas were perfect. I could tell that the cheese was freshly grated and this really complemented the nice blend of flavours. Do check it out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"This new restaurant took the place of Indian Hut, which was an okay restaurant.  Pros:  -I really like the ambiance. It feels very homey yet sophisticated. -They have decent lunch specials for around $10.  Chimchangas, enchiladas and a few other things. -The servers are very nice.   -Free tortilla chips  Cons:  -They've only been open for a month, and they got a super busy lunch rush and service was slightly slow but still acceptable. -They have vegetarian options but no vegan options.  -No appetizers just mostly entrees.    I ordered a chimichanga and it was crispy and tasty.  The side salad that came with it was tasty too.    Verdict: This is more of a 3.5 star but I'm rounding up since they are new and to offset the one star from the other review because it's not really deserved considering that person never even went to the restaurant."}
{"text":"We love the food here!    Chimichanga is great, as are the tacos.   But their Guacamole is to die for!   So fresh!!!     The service is exceptional.    Family run business who bend over backwards to please.     When it comes to Mexican food,  I'm very picky,  but this place never dissapoints."}
{"text":"Great authentic food!   The (free) chips and salsa/hot sauce to start our meal were very delicious, freshly fried chips with just the right amount of salt.  Our server (owner of the business) was extremely kind and helpful with recommendations.  The nachos were superb (an awesome change from the standard Kelsey's/Jack Astor's/Boston Pizza nachos) and I would highly recommend the chimichanga!!!!  Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Oh my where to start...I am in Toronto for business and made a completely random decision to stop in for lunch. Instantly I began to regret my decision but since I only have an hour this would have to do. I had to walk up to the cash register to get someone's attention so I could be seated. Menu was a bit limited (however being from the US, I am unfamiliar with what would be normal for this type of cuisine) I placed my order at 1230 and at 110 I asked for the check having still not received my order. During my time sitting and waiting I witnessed the following: the server used his bare hands to take ice and put it in glasses to serve drinks; sodas do not receive ice as it is poured from a can and into a glass; if someone ordered a bottle if beer the server would open the bottle and would smell the beverage (I was blown away as I watched him do this multiple times). Perhaps not receiving my order was the best thing that could have happened for me."}
{"text":"You have to laugh at the service of this place.  We ordered our food and a server came 10mins later with menus.....  Then we waited about 25mins for our drinks, the corona was room temperature.  We then waited another 20mins for our food and they missed serving my friend his meal (it came 10 mins later).  We asked for cutlery 3 times before getting it.  When we got our bill they entered some of the items wrong.  Tequila shots were \"quesadillas\", our coronas were \"tecate\".    Wait there's more, that men's washroom is like a slip and slide of water, piss and dirt.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Toronto health inspectors just paid them a visit and gave them a red notice for gross unsanitary conditions which meant immediate closure until further notice.  It's probably safer to lick the toilet seat of a dive bar washroom  than to eat here ...me no gusto!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place has reviews with more than 1 star. They must be friends of the owners."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I have ever eaten. This is not TexMex, it is Mexican. The owners treat you like family each meal tastes like it was made just for you. Will make this a regular stop."}
{"text":"Um.... not good. Margaritas were basically lime juice. They only take cash which was a surprise and we had to go to an atm. Don't bother. Also, strange menu options."}
{"text":"I was hoping to see more reviews and pictures of this place, but there wasn't, so I decided to give it a try and share with everyone my findings.  I'm giving this place a 3.5, but leaning more to the lower end, hence the 3 stars. Here's a breakdown for my rating.  Restaurant Design/Interior - 3.5 stars The location of the store is pretty convenient, situated on Church St, just South of Bloor. At first, I thought this is one of those places where you go in, grab take out, and go, with maybe a few bar seats to sit and eat. However, to my surprise, this place was a full restaurant with maybe around 12-15 tables (40-50 people). It might be a bit confusing when you first walk in though, because I was. When you get through the front door, you're in a long hallway. If you go straight, it leads directly into the kitchen, but there's also no front desk/podium/kiosk, so you wouldn't know whether to keep walking straight or just grab a table yourself. A bar is half hidden, but still visible from dining area (see picture).  Service - 3 stars Maybe they were under staffed, or they're still hiring, but there was only one guy and he's always busy. I don't know if he was the one working the kitchen as well, maybe, maybe not. He's very friendly, however, he's just not around for anything, and you have to wait a while to ask for anything.   Food - 3.25 stars We get a free serving of nachos with salsa and hot sauce, as you'd expect from any Mexican restaurants. The nachos were pretty fresh, and the sauces all tasted pretty authentic. I ordered the Chimichanga, which is a flour tortilla filled with rice, your choice of chicken or veg, lots of marble cheese, sour cream on top, served with rice and refried beans (see picture). The chicken and rice is wrapped inside the tortilla, with the sour cream and marble cheese spread on top of it. A few nachos chips on the side for eating the refried beans, and a small portion of salad as well. The salad was pretty plain, with lots of oil in it (a little too much for my taste). The Chimichanga itself was pretty good, a pretty decent portion as well. It's almost the size of a 500 ml water bottle. The fillings were both chicken and rice, at about 60:40 ratio. I find that the flavour was a little lacking, as I compared it to some authentic Mexican food I had recently in Mexico. The taste is still good, but it's not as strong as I expected it to be."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  This new restaurant came to my attention from my Grabb app. It was a convenient way to take out and head back to the office. A bit on the pricier end of lunch specials in the area. But if you work near Bloor and Church, and wouldn't mind veering off the typical Salad Days give this a shot.  They have lunch specials! ($10-$12) Ordered: Signature chimichanga special ($12) Flour tortilla filled with rice, chicken and marbled cheese, deep fried and served with refried beans and small portion of mixed salad   Portion size was just right. Cheesy comfort food on a bed of savoury rice and the hot sauce is a must! However, the dish is missing a sour element to cut through the cheesy taste. Still yummy overall. The other lunch specials came with sour cream in the description but this one didn't.   Ordered through the app at 1pm on a Friday and it was ready within 8 mins.  It wasn't busy at all when I picked up my food. They deserve more business!"}
{"text":"Hours have been a bit unpredictable, but now that they seem fully open with a liquor license on the way, I'm looking forward to eating here again. The tacos were deliciously authentic, and they offered us free tortilla chips & Pico de gallo while we waited. It also doesn't hurt that I live in the area.  Try the Tortilla Soup and Tacos!"}
{"text":"Just don't. I'm not even done eating my food and I have to review this badly because I can't even. The table is dirty, the free chips that came came in a previously used basket (we realized this after when at the bottom we saw leftover sauce from the person before), the lady who served us carried one of the water glasses in her armpit, the guacamole was subpar, and the enchilada and tacos were worse than chipotle (and to me chipotle is considered edible and would go back.) I have no idea why it's given a 3 stars."}
