{"text":"The place is at the end of a small strip mall. Large indoor space with a few tables. The food was really good, and not what I would have expected. I had the fried shrimp which was very good, lightly breaded with the tails removed. Also had a loaded baked potato which was also very good. My wife had the chicken fingers, which were actual chicken breast meat, and not processed. Fresh cut fries also. Very good prices. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Thick, fresh cut fries are incredible. That's the only item I've tried so far since there aren't many vegetarian options. I've heard good things about the wings. People are very nice and portions are good."}
{"text":"Just moved into this area and wanted a quick bite for lunch.  Stopped in and this was one of the best burgers my husband and I have ever had.  The french fries were amazing and fresh cut.  I'm telling you, you need to go check this place out. The food is awesome!!!   The guy is the order taker, the cook and the server!!!  I don't know how he does it all.  We can't wait to try another item on his menu."}
{"text":"Nice little place, decor needs a little more inviting feel but I think they just opened. Very friendly and attentive. The food is very good. Hubby  had the wings and loved them. My burger and fries were so good, even though the temps out side were in the single digits the taste of my burger put me in an out side BBQ in the summer. Everything was also so fresh just look at how red the tomato on my burger is in January! The banana pudding is yumyumyum.. Can't wait to try everything."}
{"text":"Food is prepared when you make your order so I waited about 10-15 minutes for my food. I ordered a shrimp salad.

Shrimp is battered but it's possible they grille it too. Mine cake batter but they were delicious. Salad was basic, ice burg lettuce, onion m, cheese tomato. Nothing special as far as the salad ingredients. The ranch dressing was just how I like it.

I would definitely try them out again, they have 50Â¢ wings M-F FROM 11-2pm. I'm interested in how their burgers taste along with the fries."}
{"text":"After several months of driving by, I decided to stop by for lunch. The space is inviting- retro chic, bright, clean with a jazzy flare. On to the menu. I had the fried shrimp and fresh cut fries. My meal left me desiring more. No condiments needed on my fries and they were well seasoned, fresh and bursting with flavor(as were my shrimp). 

The menu offers the following options: seafood, poultry, beef, vegetarian, deserts and a host of options for sides. Definitely coming back for more of what they have to offer."}
