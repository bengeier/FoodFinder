{"text":"We were in the area to check out a certain store at the Shops at Don Mills. Since I don't like making single-purpose trips, we decided to have lunch here and try a restaurant that was exclusive to this area. After looking up restaurants here the previous night, we decided on Anthony's since the menu offerings looked good (description-wise) and prices seemed fair.

When we arrived, we were kindly greeted and promptly seated. Our server was very friendly and attentive. We definitely felt very welcomed.

While waiting for our food, we noticed the customer demographic (as mentioned in a previous review) was mostly elderly folks. \"Cool\" or \"hip\" would no doubt be the last words used to describe this place - but in the end, it's all about the food for me...

We ordered the Chicken Anthony's and Pork Schnitzel lunch menu special which included soup of the day (Tomato Basil), salad from the salad bar, and dessert. The soup was not that great and the salad was nothing spectacular, but not horrible either. However, the entrees were both very delicious and we definitely enjoyed our main course the most. For the dessert, I chose the Cr√®me Caramel which was okay but did not taste very fresh.

Aside from those negatives, I would definitely be back again. The Chicken Anthony's was the best of the two dishes we ordered so I would most likely order it again. It is just a shame this place is so out of the way for us out-of-towners. (If there is a next time, I would probably choose something different or just forgo the lunch special add-ons altogether. The main course was pretty filling as-is.)"}
{"text":"This place was convenient, so I planned to meet a friend here while we both in the area.  The friend didn't show up.

I'm bumpint Anthony's to 3 stars for the fresh mushrooms and real cheddar in the Mushroom Cheddar omelet.  Also for the actual grains in the whole wheat toast.  I didn't notice that last time.

My friend gets one star."}
{"text":"I can understand the poor reviews of this place. I think the \"younger\" generation might find this restaurant tired, old, and at times, grungy looking. But let me paint a picture for you of the kind of folks that do come here. 

I was having a glass of vino (which was a great Merlot by the way!) and the table beside me sat a very, very old couple. The man was in his absolute Sunday best, and had a cane and a curved back so his face always was to the ground. His wife, dressed to the nines, had a foldable walker. This lovely couple, who still had each other, sat down to have \"home style\" cooked Lasagna and Beef Soup. They didn't need theatrics or Momofuku or Frog Legs with Confit Star Anise dipped in butter from the Himalayas. They just wanted a place to go out in style and enjoy each other's company.

And this is what Anthony's mean for a lot of these elderly couples. I saw another lady who was grabbing food from the buffet and putting the plate on her walker. Service is homely. Everyone knows each other. When my parents and I left, the manager, who was sitting down having food himself, thanked us for dropping by.

The food is somewhat blah, and greasy, and not put together nicely. But it's food. And it's decent. Think diner stuff.

There are a lot of regulars, including my dad and his 83 year old friend. It's not a place I would go regularly, but I'm sure that lovely couple will continue to brave the cold to come here."}
{"text":"My friends and I wanted to go to a restaurant at the Shops at Don Mills. This one turned out to be located on the outside of the shops. As this is a family restaurant, it was not as cool and youthful as the other restaurants. 
First of all, it was filled with seniors. I wondered if it it was attached to a seniors home, for 100% of the other people were old.
Arriving in the restaurant, my friend and I stood there, and began to wonder if we seat ourselves in the restaurant. Finally someone came to greet us. We didn't get menues until 10 or 15 minutes after everyone in our group had arrived. The waiter finally got around to getting our orders, only to rush us into making decisions. Then meals didn't come for a long time. Those whose meals came with soups and salads went to the salad and soup bar. Which is where the waiter got a Caesar salad for my friend who only ordered that for dinner. After waiting a while my friends continued to get more soup and salad and even got some for the rest of us who were getting quite hungry. Finally entrees showed up, most at different times. 
The spinach tortellini was pretty good. Others found the shepherds pie to be only alright, and the lasagna to be okay. 
For the second half of the meal the waiter was inconsistent with filling our water glasses. 
If you're looking for something cool, youthful, and fun, this is probably not the place to go."}

this place is crap crap & more crap!!"}
{"text":"I've been a customer, along with my husband, to Anthony's Grill since I first moved into the Don Mills area about 7 years ago. And have loved almost every one of our visits.

This place has a wide variety of appetizers and entrees, with some vegetarian selections. It also has a few items that we've not been able to get anywhere else, such as the calf's liver and a grouper fish entree, two of my husband's favourites. My personal favourites are the turkey BLT, Pork Schnitzel, and souvlaki dinner. 

The staff really know us there, and we have taken friends there for lunch or dinner several times over the years. Even when we went there for a turkey dinner one Thanksgiving, when it was rather busy, the food was still perfectly cooked. 

We are usually able to get the seats we prefer, by the window, even when it's quite busy, which happens occasionally, mostly on weekends.

While it is a little on the pricier side, if you need a reasonably priced, but classy experience with a variety of food to serve different tastes, Anthony's is a place to eat at."}
{"text":"Been here a couple time only for breakfast. 
I always get the American breakfast on the menu. The toast here is super yummy; different from most. The eggs and hash are the same as any other places. This place always seem to have a lot of elderly couple that dine here. They do have a all you can eat breakfast as well. Overall, not bad price($10) good service and good breakfast."}
{"text":"This was definitely one of the worst places I have ever been.  It was late in the day and we were really hungry so we just stopped at the first place we could find.  When we walked in, everyone at the restaurant just kind of stared at us, as if they have never seen young adults.

We were placed in a corner and the server took forever to get to us.  He also didn't look to happy when we said that we just wanted water to drink.  When we finally got our order through and got our food, the food tasted as bad as it looked.  My boyfriend had the lamb dish and when it arrived, there was three slices of what I would assume is lamb covered in gravy.  It tasted horrible.  I got the turkey sandwich, the serving size was tiny and the turkey was so dry that I couldn't even finish it. 

This is the worst place I have ever been to.  Don't ever go here!"}
