{"text":"Very disappointed in this place.  Our waiter came across as bossy and pretty crusty in his attitude.  The food was subpar.  Undersalted carpaccio and oversalted risotto.  My wife's calamari and pasta were nothing special.  For meals that we could have done better at home, there's no reason to come here and spend $200.  Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Went to IL Posto for Winterlicious 2017.  There were 8 of us at 5:00 p.m. on a rainy Thursday night.  No other customers in the restaurant.  We ordered from the Winterlicious menu.  Expensive at $48.00.  The appetizer was OK, mushroom salad.  The entire flat iron steak was quite good.  The desert Tiramisu was not good.  The problem was that we asked for separate bills which was a problem for the waiter.  He finally provided the separate bills after 1/2 hour wait and added 18% tip on each bill.  He did not get our coats for us.  We had to find them ourselves.  Would not go there again."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant tonight and was surprised that they had their summerlicious tasting menu on for $45.  We sat outside in the wonderful patio but that's about where the positives ended.  The food was mediocre and the service was even worse.  We were visited more often by a server from another section (friendly and efficient younger Italian gentleman) than our own server (Sri Lankan fellow, only friendly and attentive when it came time to pay the bill).   Calamari appetizers were fairly good as was the beef carpaccio.  Veal Scallopini and Gnocchi mains were mediocre and cold.  Panna Cotto was good but their Banana Chocolate cake was only so-so.  With so many other restaurants in the area its no wonder Il Posto was half empty on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Went for Summerlicious and have never experienced such rude behaviour. Food was only average. To top it off, they automatically added an 18% tip without saying they would (we would have tipped but a reduced amount for such poor service). Had to argue extensively to have the automatic tip removed. They should not participate in Summerlicious if the waiter is going to be that grumpy.  Will not return"}
{"text":"I've walked by this restaurant on the way to Whole Foods fairly often, so I decided to give it a test drive during Winterlicious.

My dining companion and I went for lunch. I had the soup (Carrot Ginger), the veal and spinach ravioli. and the Banana Chocolate Meringue cake. My companion had the same, except that she started with the Mixed Greens.

When we sat down there was bread at the table. It was a reasonable offering, however the butter was fridge hard.

Starters:
The carrot ginger soup tasted overwhelmingly of ginger. It was bland and had no other flavour note than ginger and a faint taste of carrot. Unimpressed.
My companion reports that her mixed greens were soggy. They seemed to be the same run-of-the-mill mix greens with balsamic vinaigrette that everyone has had a thousand times, but soggy.

Entrees:
The veal and spinach ravioli was very soft, almost to the point of being overcooked. The filling was flavorless.

Dessert:
I love banana, chocolate, and meringue. I was hoping for something like Chunky Monkey ice cream, but a cake. Instead we got a soggy brown colored cake that tasted of overripe brown banana pieces with a misshapen and odd tasting meringue on the outside. The chocolate taste was weak at best. If I had bought this cake at a grocery store I would have returned it.

Service:
Extremely inattentive. There was no quality check on any of the courses. In addition, the time to deliver the bill was extremely long. And, after we paid they did not wait to give us our coats but rather they threw them over the back of a chair on a nearby empty table.

I'm not sure, given the other positive reviews, if this restaurant can be ok but for some reason made a really lazy Winterlicious menu. Regardless, I use Winterlicious to test out restaurants that I have been to before or haven't been to lately. That's what we did here and they failed. We would not return for a regular meal."}
{"text":"What a nice dinner!  Warm patio somehow quiet in the middle of Yorkville.  Great wines election.  Excellent grilled seafood. Try the octopus salad."}
{"text":"Tired Italian restaurant with no ambiance, the place smells funny (like a cellar). The food is expensive and bad, I had the special jumbo prawns and Safran risotto. The shrimps undercooked ( I had to spit it out, tasted raw) and the risotto was soggy. 
Never again."}
{"text":"Absolutely great food. The starter, insalata caprino, was a wonderful combination of subtle salt and sweet (greens, goat cheese, dried fruit, delicious balsamic vinaigrette). The salmon with tapenade and tomatoes ditto, with a generous assortment of vegetables - including summer squash, rapini, briccoli, green beans -- beautifully prepared. The grilled tiger shrimp ordered by my dinner companion were enormous, and the restaurant happily substituted a generous dollop of spaghettini with a very nice tomato sauce for the greens that ordinarily come with the dish (as we'd had the salad starter). No room for dessert, sadly; but superb Italian coffee. (Also, good selection of wine by the glass.) Far superior to the comparable places in the neighbourhood, blissfully quiet and pleasant place to sit, excellent obliging service. It is our new go-to place for an indulgent dinner where one can converse."}
{"text":"Service was great, food delicious and classic. Had the Caesar salad and short rib, both of which were wonderful. 

However, it was a Saturday night and the restaurant was less than half full, which was a little sad. 

Would come back in a heartbeat, but would love a little company!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here as part of a Living Social groupon. We had the antipasto appetizer which was delicious. Then moved onto the snapper (it was a special) for the main course. My dinner mate had the seared tuna which was also very nice. For dessert we had the warm tart with chocolate mousse. It was all very good. Wine list is good with wines by the glass, half bottle and full bottle with many price ranges to choose from. Ambiance was very nice. Price was pretty good for what you get. Our waiter was a bit grumpy which would be the only reason my rating isn't even higher. The owner was there as well. If I were to ask for anything more it would be better more personable service. But this is really being picky."}
{"text":"Toronto the food was disappointing. It was very Bland. Even more disappointing and aggravating was that the waiter was very arrogant and even hostile. We came for an early dinner and there was no one in the restaurant. It really didn't fill up at all while we were there. That's probably a sign of the mediocre food and the very poor quality service. I don't get it why waiters need to have such an attitude. Get another job if it's not working for you"}
{"text":"Great food and great service I love it here I would come back anytime and the wait staff that is so friendly"}
{"text":"It's been almost two decades since I've last been to Il Posto. Sad to say, my memories of how things use to be were much better. Food and decor were the two noticeable transformations. 

Presentation of our meal was good, but the food lacked pizzazz. Although I liked the spaghetti being done el dante. 

The seafood spaghetti I ordered was extremely weak in the sense that the few pieces of scallops were of the size of a green pea. The calamari, if I was able to fined them, were just as tiny. There were plenty of mussels; sadly to my disappointment there weren't any clams. 

Fortunately for me, my date ordered the clams with spaghetti. Sad to say, the clam pasta was extremely salty. Luckily, I had a persistent date and went through with dessert, as I would have just left because of the week appetizer and disappointing entrees. 

The tiramisu was the outstanding dish of the entire evening. The average of three stars is well deserved, but somewhat unbelievable given my experience a generation ago (as at that time, it was most definitely a 4 to even 5 stars). 

As an aside (as I'm not here to suggest how anyone runs a restaurant), I found it a little disturbing that the one waiter taking care of about 5 tables was also doing \"clean up\" work of bringing in table cloths from the empty patio. I understand the need for efficiency, but I just found this to be an awkward distraction."}
{"text":"We went as work gathering - early in the week and expectations were high.

The service was clumsy and lazy - drinks were confused and there was uncertainty of availability of various dishes. The starters were liked by some and others were not as happy....the surprise of all was when one of us ordered the mushroom soup and the kitchen made a substitution to carrot soup without consultation. A first for me...and to make matters worse it was simply an awful...not finished, indeed barely started.

When the entrees came out they were in a haphazard manner...spaced appreciably apart. The general consensus was ok for some and not up there for others....

A disappointing experience for those who take their food seriously."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this little hidden gem in yorkville, it can easily be missed. I've had dinner and lunch here many times.

Dinner is nice and romantic and the service is amazing.

Lunch is nice and quiet (there isn't many people that come here for lunch) you get most of the place to yourself and sitting beside the window on a nice day and enjoying good food, what more can you ask for. good for business lunches as it's nice and quite.

I've ate here so many times I don't even know which food to start describing, let's just say I really enjoy the food to come back here again and again."}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon for $40 for $70 worth of food. Our waiter was extremely friendly and attentive! Made sure we always had a refill of bread, butter and water at our table. He even had all of our dishes split (since we were sharing between two people). We were seated at the patio which is very spacious and a nice atmosphere. Very quiet, and in the heart of Yorkville which was nice! Felt so cozy! 

Food was spectacular! Everything came out in a timely manner. The mussels were absolutely amazing...one of the best mussels dishes I've had. They were so tender and the wine wine sauce was perfect! 

The salmon tartare was decent. Personally I'm not a fan of capers or sesame oil but it was still quite tasty. 

The clam spaghetti was very light. It was just a little bland, could have used a little bit more flavouring in the pasta sauce but it was still very good. 

Our total came out to about $59 taxes included. We didn't end up using the entire $70 Groupon credit as we were too full! Portion sizes were good. 

Great Italian food, service and atmosphere! Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Just off of Avenue Rd and just north of the Four Seasons is this little upscale Yorkville Italian restaurant. It's set back from the street, in a court yard but there's a sign on the street guiding your way. 

My two lady friends (chartered accountants so they're not ready to bear any cleavage for me) and I took Il Posto in for Winterlicious. We got a lunch setting. Three courses + bread for $20 (+tax 'n' tip). With coffee it came to about $30 a person. 

I had the calamari, fish of the day, and creme caramel for dessert. My friends opted for the Veal Scallopini and Carpaccio Di Manzo for the appetizer. 

The interior is a little small, nothing screams out at you in terms of decor but nothing is wrong. It's your basic intimate little Italian up market joint. The service was excellent. I gather some places sort of view Winterlicious diners as maybe unsophisticated cherry pickers looking to scarf down a cheap(er) meal but Il Posto lays on the service nicely and professionally.

I have to give high marks for everything I put in my mouth. The calamari was tender and a nice portion. The fish of the day was a nice sized piece of trout and a nice sized piece of red snapper. The trout was simply amazing. Some of the best prepared fish I've ever had. The snapper (tee hee) I kind of wish I ate first as after the trout it was almost a let down. But my taste buds recovered after 3 or 4 bites.

My friends felt the veal was a bit too salty. One friend  casually mentioned it and the waiter was quite apologetic. 

The creme caramel was hard to screw up. Based on some of the other deserts we eyeballed, everything looked quite scrumptious.

Anyway, I was highly impressed and I'd probably come back for their regular menu, especially if they're serving trout."}
{"text":"3.5/5

First $45 dinner place I tried for Winterlicious goes to Il Posto in Yorkville. The menu seemed interesting and I wanted to try an upscale Italian/Mediterranean restaurant.

The ambiance was very quiet and the restaurant was not busy at all. It looked like a place where you can choose for date night, as the environment, music and feel was there. Upon entry, you can choose to have your server hang your jacket at a secure place away from the dining area, or you can hang your jackets yourselves on your chair.

I selected the calamari alla griglia, spaghetti ai frutti di mare, and the tiramisu. Generally the pace of the food coming out was quite good, although the appetizer did take a while to come. The calamari was excellent and perfectly grilled and the olives were a great touch to the appetizer. It mentioned that the dish would be spicy, but I didn't feel any spice at all. The spaghetti ai frutti di mare was basically a seafood medley spaghetti, which had a nice garlic taste, but I felt underwhelmed by the seafood medley selection and tomatoes. For an upscale place, I somewhat expected some clams or better diced tomatoes. The tiramisu, in my opinion, was the highlight of the meal. If you've never had an authentic tiramisu, definitely order one from here. It's very creamy, cheese-filled, and the coffee taste was very strong.

I did not really like the service during my time eating here, as there were some regulars who were eating who got preferential treatment over us, including a stint where both employees (there were only two for dinner) were treating two regulars to some alcohol, while we were trying to get their attention in asking for the bill.

Overall, food was good, but a little bit below what the price standard would be for a $45 prix fixe dinner. Service was poor and definitely needs some improvement. For Yorkville standards, I would imagine there are better places, but I wouldn't say no to coming back if I so happen to be nearby and craving upscale dining."}
{"text":"went here for summerlocious. The veal main was great, as we're our starters. We sat outside which was nice. Only small complaint: it too a long time to get refilled with sparkling and tap water. we
had to ask several times. Other than that - a very nice meal."}
