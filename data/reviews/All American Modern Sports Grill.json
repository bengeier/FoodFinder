{"text":"Very cool, and clean. Good food, nice atmosphere. Patience is a virtue. But worth the wait."}
{"text":"We were told there was no tables available, even though place was half empty. When we turned to leave a table magically opened up. Service was poor. Food was below average. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant. Great sports bar with plenty of televisions and a great patio. Staff is very friendly however the food and drinks take WAY too long. We waited over an hour for wings and 40 minutes for drinks. Under staffed? Yes.   Hopefully they will work out the service issues because it's really a nice place."}
{"text":"Took my wife to All-American after another restsurant lost our reservations and it turned out to be the best thing that could have happened to us that evening. Food tasted fantastic and Sam, our server, was very knowledgeable about their menu and had and even better sense of humor to boot! We had all the ingredients for a sour night but it ended up being extra sweet! If you stop by ask for Sam!"}
{"text":"We eat there often. We have not had a bad meal yet. The atmosphere is nice and they have a lot of TVs for sports fans. We usually sit at the bar the bartenders are very friendly. And when we sat at a table, we have had great service too."}
{"text":"Bad experience and a snobby attitude from the hostess....both of them. She couldn't seat us regardless that the place was about a third full. She just smiled and said sorry and let us walk out the door. Wow! We were a party of four who would of easily spent plenty of money. We were in shock how they just let customers walk out the door. We won't be back!"}
{"text":"Upscale desperately needed sports bar in DC Ranch. A billion TVs in a very cool space paired with outstanding food and a great cocktail/beer list. It's buzzing and is a fun place to watch a college FB game."}
{"text":"Steven was a great waiter for us. Great food here for a family wedding would recommend for lunch. Going to try and come back for dinner before we go back to the Northeast."}
{"text":"5 Stars for server Curtis. He had great instincts as to when to talk with us and when to not interrupt us. He made good recommendations, too. Great experience on the patio. We kicked off the meal with drinks and cheese curds, had some good entrees including OMG Chicken and finished with Bananas Foster. I only wish I had time for a cigar and a scotch. Next time...."}
{"text":"We went to All American with a group of about 20 after a rehearsal dinner. We had a few drinks, and the maid of honor and a bridesmaid tried to order some food from the kitchen. When they found out the kitchen was closed they went next door to grab a pizza. Neither of them were aware of the policies for food after the kitchen was closed. Kat, the manager, was one of the rudest people we've ever encountered. She chastised and kicked them out. If she had asked them politely to take the food outside, that would without a doubt have been a reasonable response. Her response-definitely not. Tom, our waiter, was apologetic and kind-exactly what we'd expect from a respectable institution. I would only go here if there was no one else in town, and I didn't care about the quality of service. Needless to say I regret giving them any money for our drinks, especially for a group that size."}
{"text":"While the food was good, the portions were small. I ordered a salad with chicken and there was probably less than half a chicken breast. Given the price, we walked away hungry. Not sure if I'd go back."}
{"text":"The Bartender was perpetually distracted, on the phone, wrong order, never offered a second beer, just inane chatter.  All new faces, average to poor food. was one of my favorites."}
{"text":"The layout is a major improvement from West Addison and there are TVs everywhere which is great.  Slightly pricey for a sports bar, but they are obviously trying to go upscale which is expected for DC Ranch.  My only real gripe was the service, especially the bar manager Kat.  She gave off a rude vibe and it felt like she didn't really want to be there. We all have bad days, so hopefully this was just one for her although it looks like I'm not the first to have this experience based on some other reviews.  I'll be back again as they work the kinks out simply because the food, beer, tv combo is great."}
{"text":"Didn't promote happy hour specials, wings dry and lukewarm, rowdy patron was asked to leave then allowed to return. Sent email from website, no response"}
{"text":"Always great food.  Love the chicken dish! We come here quite a bit for the chili, chicken wings and burgers!"}
{"text":"We had a great time tonight! Food was awesome and our server Mieka was fabulous! Oh, and loved the live music."}
{"text":"Great Kiwi Martinis! Nice place to chill, get out of the heat. Listen to live music on the weekends. There is another location in Fountain Hills, fantastic owners!"}
{"text":"My second time there and only been opened 2 days!  The classic upscale atmosphere, friendly wait staff, TV central and the delicious food!  The steak salad was amazing, tasty burgers, buffalo shrimp very yummy!  A home run for DC Ranch Market Street - this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"We could add actual stars but the hostess told us all tables taken, we inquired about booths that were empty as we walked by, but no, not available.  Same booths still not occupied after we went to neighboring place, who were happy to see us, and dropped at least $100 for four adults.  Work on staff needed."}
{"text":"Sm was the best! Had all the wings so good & best was dessert & great wine selection will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to dinner. It looked like a very nice place. There are TV screens everywhere with different sports on. Really nice bar. Good menu! We shared a Caesar salad. We then had medium hot chicken wings and shrimp in pesto cream sauce.  Our server was Victoria and she was friendly, courteous and very helpful. Everything was timed correctly with each course coming out when it should. Overall it was very enjoyable and we will go back."}
{"text":"My new favorite place. Food was soooo good! Had the crab cakes and it was a home run. Server was attentive and made great food suggestions and plenty of TV's to watch any sporting event you'd like. I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"I have supported this business since it opened. The staff has always been kind and i have no complaints until yesterday Sunday January 24th. We arrived around 1:30 and the place was really busy. I very nicely waited over 3 hours by the bourbon bar for a seat to sit down and order some food. No problem. My server was the best....I go to sit down and some drunk woman that had been drinking since 11am grabs the chair from me, puts her handbag on it as says MY FRIEND IS ON HER WAY, AND IT IS HER CHAIR NOW!!!! Really? No!!!! She begins to shove me and starts cursing words i would never repeat. Then she threatens me by saying her group of friends are going to take me outside and attack me? I know she is drunk so i try to ignore this comment... She would not stop harrising me. The manager comes over, knowing nothing and says \" Is this a police matter?\" I said no over a bar chair? Finally told her there were cameras up above and she needed to stop!! Truth is the manager knew she was there for hours drinking and she should have been told to go home and sleep it off. He did nothing!!!  I expect an apology and for him to keep an eye on things going on in his restaurant!!!!  I am so upset as i really like this place but i will never be put in a situation like that again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Every time a Restaurant goes in this center we pray it will be good! This place is Not Good! If you want to watch a game they have Hundreds of T.V's. If you want good or even decent food this will not be your place. Everything is so bland! The quality of their food is very poor. You would be better off eating at In&Out Burger! Then go to this place for a beer and and a game!"}
{"text":"When is a sports bar not a sports bar? Or. When do you know it's a bad night at the sports bar?  When the hostess says game what game?  And people are dressed in flappers like the roaring 20s as 20s music is playing. She should have known every game, on every channel and what TV had it on. We left and went elsewhere."}
{"text":"Best place ever good good good enjoyed my cheese curds and all American burger and my cookie skillet best place I have ate at in long time great service good is fresh was the best will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Have a great all around meal. Service was really good. Accommodate kids very well. Were able to substitute French fries with veggie sticks from the buffalo wings. Dinner menu was very appealing and the food tasted wonderful. No complaints at all."}
{"text":"Service was slow. Waiter seemed distracted. It took him a solid 20 minutes to take our order. Ordered pulled pork...then told they were out. Once I was told that pulled pork was not available, I really sort of expected the manager to stop by. Nope. Paid for drinks and left. Maybe a snapshot in time...likely just shitty management."}
{"text":"This place is awful, do not go! I went with a friend and the water we drank tasted really bad only to find out it had bleach or some form of cleaner in it. How do we know? My friend spilled some on her dress and it bleached her blue dress white! Then the owners refused to reimburse her for the cost of her dress after she complained, instead they offered her a free meal. LOL Terrible customer service, bad water and bad management. Two thumbs down, find another pub."}
{"text":"Football season can't come fast enough! This is a sports bar with great food and comfortable seating / perfect for settling in to a lengthy sports game!  Their wine list is both extensive and high quality. They offer a good selection of bottle beers and some draft options. Their apps have something for everyone, from five flavors of hand crafted buffalo wings to a charcuterie board to grilled artichokes. The main menu consists of entree salads, burgers (the onion blue looks ahh-mazing), a few pasta selections (all which can be made gluten free), and about six choice entrees (pork tenderloin, salmon, steak, etc).  The waitstaff is phenomenal. The attention to detail and service with a smile is unsurpassed. We waited about five minutes while they diligently cleaned off our table. I overheard another family who similarly watched as three people prepped their booth comment during their brief wait how they will have the cleanest booth in America.   I don't want to fail to mention that their outdoor area is large, with misters and heaters depending on the weather. There are both standard tables/chairs as well as large couches outside.  I very seriously cannot wait to come back to this restaurant. It has instantly become a go-to place for our family."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food- some of the best ribs we've ever had! the Isabelle's chicken is to die for, in fact we've really never had a bad meal and we will be back many more times. there's a large outdoor courtyard with a fire place and the whiskey bar is a really unique touch. there's a bunch of TVs but isn't loud and obnoxious like your typical sports bar. Would highly suggest to anyone!"}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant for our family Easter lunch as I didn't want a set menu or all you can eat brunch.....booked a table for the 8 of us outside. We were 4 adults , 4 kids. I really was thinking it would be so-so and I was ok with that as it worked on many levels, including being in our hood. It wasn't busy, so I though oh-oh, not good! Wrong! From the time we sat at our perfect table outside, our service was outstanding, and the food very good! A big shout out to our amazing server Mieke, who was on point with everything! Thank you All American, and especially Mieke for making our family outing outstanding!"}
{"text":"They had a VEGGIE burger.!! I was thrilled. It wasn't on the menu but As a traveling vegetarian I always ask. Sometimes it pays off. They charbroiled it perfectly. It was great after a long day. My husband had the NY Strips and he was very happy. The prices are a little steep $14 for burger and $32 for the strips, but it IS Fountain Hills,  So ..... when in Rome, you have to pay Rome prices. Would definitely go back for the veggie burger."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a sports game. Good menu with a great variety of choices. Mieke was a great waitress who made our visit memorable! We'll be back ,,, with friends!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is good but we had slow poor service and it wasn't busy.... Tried to order dinner but took forever and then they were out of what we wanted.  Wine was good though..."}
{"text":"Food was a bit weak. Shishito Peppers were some of the most bland I've had. For my meal I had the baby back ribs but they were dry and overcooked. I also had asparagus on the side which was okay flavor but a bit bland. The atmosphere is cool but they seemed understaffed for the waiters to be able to manage the amount of people there. I would probably return here for a drink but not a meal."}
{"text":"We LOVE  this restaurant! Another revew said it's a  hidden gem and it IS! This isn't a family restaurant . Its a vibrant trendy and  full of energy! TV's everywhere! Our server was so freindly and there for us.My husband loved his cheese burger!  My Isabelle Mediterranean chicken was delicious! ."}
{"text":"I wanted to have high hopes for this place but I don't.  Service was on the food was mediocre.  Ordered the French dip and ribs. Au jus for the French dip was oregano based and not very good.  The ribs were dry as the desert we are in.  Some kind of weird smoked flavor was on them.  So needless to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"This place was really good! I went in determined to find good ribs and had the best half rack of dry rub, Carolina style ribs that I've had in a long time. Sat outside where I could see the main bar and side patio area with live entertainment, which sounded really nice. My food server's name was Sam and she was AWESOME! I'm kind of new to Scottsdale and she told me a little about the history of the restaurant and overall area. I was by myself and sat alone, as opposed to the bar, but I felt as if I was dining with others. Very nice night, very nice atmosphere, decor and immaculate bathrooms too. Will be back next week for sure. It is now on my short list of weekly go to places."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! Awesome atmosphere, amazing service, seriously impressive cocktails and upscale \"bar\" food.    The beet salad is insane, burgers you dream about and so much bourbon!!! Love it here!!!!"}
{"text":"not good.  ordered burger with frys, hold the pickles, burger comes smothered in pickles, frys came when almost finished burger.  waitress did not care one bit, then the bill arrives, totally wrong.  North Scottsdale, DC Ranch folks will not put up with this sort of poor and indifferent service very long.  we have so many choices for places similar to this place."}
{"text":"Happy hour with the Men'd group from church. The perfect excuse for a good glass of wine.  Looking at fhe American cheeseburgers to the right and left of me is a suggestion that I return when I am hungry"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sports bars in the city.  It's a great place to watch sports, very cool atmosphere with a separate bourbon bar, outdoor lounge and a dining patio.  They have a fantastic 6 dollar double burger on happy hour.  Bartenders are friendly and the crowd is social which seems rare these days.  I have sat at the bar several times and struck up conversations with strangers about business, sports, travel, and (shhhhh) even politics.  It's just a great place with a great crowd in a great neighborhood.  Doesn't get much better than that."}
{"text":"The worst service our waitress was busting her butt while three girls did nothing at the podium. I ordered a medium burger it was almost rare. Coleslaw was horrible and dry. They screwed up the bill and we sat forever wanting to pay. One in our party unloaded on a manager. $21 bucks for water and a burger which is robbery."}
{"text":"This time we came and had very poor service. We sat at the main bar and were ignored by the blonde female bartender who proceeded to give other patrons drinks who showed up well after we did. When she finally did come to take our order she waited on three other people before us and then totally forgot about us.    The food was marginal so we were a bit disappointed because we usually like this place.  Oh well"}
{"text":"All American Grill.  I have been coming here for 3 weeks.. We had a company event here the staff is very attentive, the food is awesome and the drinks are unreal.  I love this place so much and I will recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"The service is worth 5 stars but the food isn't good. So I gave this place three stars. Service is superb, great location, the food needs more work. We weren't happy with our food and the manager took care of it. He and our waitor were super nice. We wish the food was better so we could come back."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Food is okay, ambiance is good, however table placement is horrible.  Not enough tables and the ones that do exist are next to the door.  That means hot or cold air depending on how irbid outside.  Anyway, okay place - would recommend try it out but not a place I am drawn to on a regular basis."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here after watching the place be fitted out. The place is very nice. Casual. Big bar area. The food is expensive, but very good. We had the sliders and some other apps. the TV are well placed. it was not loud and especially on the patio it was very relaxing. The beer selection is amazing. We had a wonderful time and will be back."}
{"text":"I have been visiting this place on Fridays for happy hour. The food is excellent, the staff is friendly and I really enjoy the atmosphere. They also have live music starting at 9 pm on the weekends."}
{"text":"Nicer than your typical sports bar. Loved the variety of burger options! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in while my fiance was in the salon across the way getting her hair done. Nice, clean, modern atmosphere with a more classy feel than your typical sports bar. Not pretentious but definitely suited more for those who are accustomed to finer and classy establishments.  Had a Guinness and side of sweet potato fries which were both equally delicious. Good selection of food and drinks looking at the menu. This is my kind of place and definitely will return when in the area and the opportunity presents itself."}
{"text":"First weekend of FOOTBALL season and there were a couple of interesting FOOTBALL games simultaneously starting at 4:30 pm on the major (not cable) networks.  I thought - why not watch some FOOTBALL at the 'ALL-AMERICAN' SPORTS BAR?    Walked in a few minutes before kick-off.  Huge place - 30+ big screens.  Ratio of customers to workers = about 1 to 1.  Not ONE TV in the ALL-AMERICAN SPORTS BAR was tuned to a FOOTBALL game.  Loud music playing.  Nobody watching sports.  Asked if they would put on the FOOTBALL game in some corner somewhere (anywhere?) with sound.  Help agreeable ('we'll have to ask manager' if we can put sound on any TV) and they gave us a corner booth (but first we had to wait for it to be cleaned - despite a virtually empty restaurant and tons of bored employees they let dirty tables sit around) with two immediately overhead TVs.  These TVs were placed so high above the booth such that no human could keep their neck in 'watching' position for an entire game and not hurt himself/herself.  (I kid you not).  Were told FOOTBALL sound would be coming but it was complicated and would take a couple of minutes.  Meanwhile I order a beer... Takes help 10 minutes to figure out how to turn on FOOTBALL at their SPORTS BAR.  15 minutes pass with no FOOTBALL sound and no beer served despite my ordering such.  So finally 22 minutes after our arrival we left with no beer ever being served and no sound ever managing to be turned to FOOTBALL.  We watched the game at another place up the street.  I will not EVER come back here under ANY circumstances.  Poorly designed place with many TVs literally unwatchable as they are placed too high above the booths.  Not really a SPORTS BAR.  I was thinking since FOOTBALL is an ALL-AMERICAN SPORT going to the ALL-AMERICAN SPORTS BAR would be perfect.  Instead ALL-AMERICAN SPORTS BAR means a place where nobody watches sports, nobody knows what games are on, nobody knows how to work the TVs and sound system, and nobody can be bothered to do stuff like clean tables and timely bring $7 beers to patrons.    Went up the street to a pizza place and had a nice meal.  Ironically - we sat in the bar at the pizza place and they put the game on for us...  We had a great time watching FOOTBALL somewhere else!  I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"Excellent Service - ask for SAM - He's the BEST!!!  Food and atmosphere are great."}
{"text":"A happy hour go to for our family. Appetizers are great, drink specials good and tasty. Nice comfortable relaxed atmosphere. Love taking our bulldog and sitting on the patio. Dinner there is also very good. Service has always been great.   So, went here yesterday (Nov 1, 2017) with my daughter for lunch and was really disappointed in the service. It said seat yourself, so we did and the servers just kept walking past us and completely ignored us for 15 minutes, never greeted us, brought us menu or water, we just sat there. They were helping the table right next to us (so they saw us) but wouldn't even make eye contact. So I finally went up to one and asked for menus (he gave me one) he then begrudgingly helped us even thought I don't think he was not suppose to be the server for our table. It was terrible. I was pretty upset. It will definitely make me think twice about coming back."}
{"text":"High quality food, we always eat every bite, AND we still get to watch all the NFL GAMES!!! I recommend their Charcuterie Board, and the Spinach Artichoke Feta Dip at the bar with Austin's drinks;) Austin is our fave bar tender!!! When we  get a table, we ask for Sam or Tom's tables, because they are super attentive and funny, so the service is great. The restaurant is a higher end sports bar, and the atmosphere is fun, and totally belongs at DC Ranch."}
{"text":"Tom was great; attentive, funny and sweet. We sat by the fire, listened to a great live band. TVs, space heaters, fun date night!!"}
{"text":"Excellent dinner experience. Server was Ty. TVs everywhere and modern music. Recommend the cheese bites and my burger and fries was pretty good."}
{"text":"Was excited to try it out even though the reviews were mixed. My parents had been there before and really like it. I decided to meet my parents there on Friday night at 8pm and surprisingly it was pretty slow and it cleared out even more as we were there. I immediately liked the atmosphere, dim lighting, lots of bar and table seating and was impressed thinking it might be my new go-to place. The menu had good options and some great salads which is really hard to find at a sports bar. It reminded me a lot of the the Fox Sports Grill at the Scottsdale Promenade.  Now, the rest of the experience.  The server was nice and friendly. They brought water to the table (as all restaurants do) but it was awful. Tasted like it was straight out of your home faucet and we all know how great that is in AZ.  I had to have something else to drink and both my mom and I ordered the Mango Moscow Mule thinking it would be a slight twist on the refreshing taste of a Moscow Mule, but it was pretty bad and we had to force ourselves to drink it. I don't know what ginger beer they use (and I like ginger a lot) but every sip tasted like a mouthful of Gari sushi ginger.  There were 4 of us at dinner and only 2 of us ate.  We each ordered the Kale and Quinoa salad and 1 of them had chicken. The server stopped by 30 minutes later and said they were just waiting on the chicken??? The salad only has 4 slices of thin chicken breast on it so I'm not sure how that's what we were waiting on.  We even joked that they must have had to run to Safeway for the chicken. After a total 40 minute wait our salads finally came. The food was ok, but would be skeptical to return based on the incredibly slowwwwww service."}
{"text":"I have never been so disgusted with a restaurant. Food was great however the manager on duty was a complete jerk. We ordered drinks and did not like them and asked for something else, the manager then came to the table and scolded my party regarding the distasteful drinks. The managers attitude alone forced my party to leave. The restaurant went ahead and charged our cards and said too bad, literally stealing our money. When asked for an owners contact, the manager walked away never to return. One of the worst restaurant experiences I have had in Scottsdale and a poor representation of a newly established location."}
{"text":"Located in the D.C. Ranch commercial area, this is a great place to watch a game.  All tables and bar stools have a tv view, including the patio. The have a great craft beer selection, including Ballast Point on draft and in bottles! I have not tried the food yet but it looks good."}
{"text":"Service is great and food is tasty. I love that their appetizers are large enough to eat as a meal . The buffalo shrimp (hot) is delicious and it comes with fries, celery and carrots (appetizer) !!! The spinach dip is also very good and the tortilla chips are made fresh which I love ! We went here Saturday to grab lunch and watch college football and it was a great atmosphere! Other nights they play awesome music and the staff is upbeat and friendly! We are moving to the area of town soon and this place will likely be one of our regular faves!"}
{"text":"Food was actually pretty good.  But they encourage smoking on a patio and if you don't smoke .... it can easily ruin your meal as it did mine.  They sell cigars and I gotta be honest, I don't want that crap around my food.  Plenty of smoke free places for me to go."}
{"text":"Awesome food, especially the burger and wings. Try the cheese curds, they're awesome! The people are great, lots of TV's, and a great smoking section. try it!"}
{"text":"We stopped here out of convenience on our way home from touring the SWCC. I hadn't been to D.C. Ranch for years but any place with the word grill in its name could be expected to have kid essentials aka burgers, chicken, etc. We can work with that!  My son was starving so the waiter recommended the appetizer portion of chicken tenders and fries over the kid's meal. He was right, it was HUGE! Easily enough for 3 or 4 people to share as an app. My son pronounced them \"the BEST!\" and chowed down.  I ordered a Blue Moon and the OMG Chicken sandwich and was very happy with my decision. Our food arrived very quickly with simple, clean presentation.  I loved the sandwich bun - it was soft and slightly toasted, but it held up to the gooey wet toppings of green chiles, crunchy slaw, and an aoli type sauce. It was a messy bite with the thick breast of chicken but good enough to lick off your fingers. Personally, I would've thrown some jalapeños and siracha in there but it still had good flavor - just not spicy enough for this hot mama!  The service was fine and cordial, our plates were cleared efficiently and we never felt ignored. The prices were as expected for this area, but not ridiculous. The Masters was on dozens of large TVs all over the bar and patio. If I lived closer, I could see enjoying happy hour or a casual dinner here again."}
{"text":"Nice decor & above average bourban/whiskey list. I was also excited to discover they had cigars available, however, a few negatives: 1) They did not have my first two choices of cigars. They don't have a very extensive list and should know what is in stock. 2) their cheese curds appetizer are not curds but mini mozzarella sticks--very misleading description. 3) When I asked if they had something I could take my leftover cigar in, i.e. cigar case, our waitress was somewhat helpful, but another employee said no and the best place for it was \"between my teeth.\" Not the answer I was looking for, to say the least. It is a good concept but they need to work on training/educating the staff."}
{"text":"This is one of our local local \"go to\" spots based on consistent quality and good service. Loads of options on the menu and a terrific happy hour as well."}
{"text":"Have to say I love the food here but way over priced.  Even for Scottsdale. Why bother saying it's a happy hour item when it's $1 off your martinis?!  The spin artichoke dip is the best Ive ever had....ever! I would give them 4 stores for food but 3 stars for drinks and prices."}
{"text":"My husband Alan and I celebrated our 36th Wedding Anniversary at the All American Modern Sports Grill last night. It was our first time there but won't be our last.  We had wonderful food and great service. I loved the Moroccan Salmon and my husband had a meat and cheese board as an appetizer and the blackened salmon sandwich for an entree.  Everything was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Great spot!! Friendly servers, cold beer, outstanding food and every sporting event you would ever need to see.  Outside patio really fun in quaint setting.  Candace the bartender is great.  Always smiling and aims to assure a fun time is had by all. The shrimp fettuccini is spectacular.  Burgers and sandwiches are delicious with generous portions.  Fun Scottsdale spot and fun people watching"}
{"text":"Awesome All American whiskey drink. Bourbon bar is chill and great patio. We didn't eat here but menu looked good."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to hang out with friends on the beautiful patio overlooking Market Street in DC Ranch. This is not your typical sports bar. This menu has got some real depth. The atmosphere is hip and fun, and the food is fantastic. Try the wings, the buffalo shrimp, the burgers, the salads, the grilled artichoke, the Isabella's Chicken and the Moroccan Salmon...oh and don't miss the fries...bliss in each bite. The wine list rivals any 5 star restaurant. I had the ZD cab last night...fantastic! There's even a bourbon bar and a separate vented cigar patio. It's a sports bar, so a perfect place to watch a game...but if you're not into sports the TVs are just above your line of vision so you can concentrate on your friends if you prefer. The owners, Veronica and Michael, have infused this place with welcoming warmth. My fave new place in North Scottsdale! Update summer 2017: Check out the new summer menu! It's outstanding. The pork chop with a grilled peach and polenta cakes are out of this world. So is the shrimp cocktail and the watermelon salad! Yum!! Their new Rosé is the perfect accompaniment."}
{"text":"Unbelievable food for a sports bar! Great spot after work and with the family!"}
{"text":"First visit tonight.  Food was decent but the service was extremely poor.  It took 15 minutes to get all of our drinks and another 40 minutes to get food.  Our waitress didn't check on us and we even had to ask another server to find her for the check.  It wasn't busy either so would have expected the service to be much better."}
{"text":"Love this new place! I was there Thursday night for the asu/Oregon game. Great atmosphere, had an excellent time!  The food is excellent and had great service. Our server was Bryce and was very knowledgeable about wine pairings to go with our food.  We will be back for Sunday football."}
{"text":"Delicious! Also, how do you beat a summer happy hour that starts at 11 am??? We only ordered the meat & cheese board and the wings, but both were so filling and very good! We will definitely be going back so we can try more things."}
{"text":"Convenient area, cool space and lots of seating/TVs. I'd recommend for apps, drinks and watching games, but wouldn't go back for just lunch or dinner. Ordered the southwest burger and thought it was just \"Okay\"."}
{"text":"I love this bar.  The food is good. There must be a real chief in the kitchen. The French Dip and Cesar Salad are my favorite but my husband gets the sliders and burgers.  It's a great place to go and watch a game if your a foodie. Funny, I have not tried a mixed drink or wine but the wine list is long. It's clean and sophisticated but so is the area."}
{"text":"Good sports bar. One of the few if not the only one in the area. Food is great. The jerk wings might be the best wings I've ever had if you like that flavor. They are super spicy and crispy. Happy hour is pretty good with lots of beer on tap and good selection of apps. It goes from 11-6."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of sports bars myself, the usual loud TV's and no opportunity to have a conversation. So the ambiance killed it for me, in addition, we were seated right by the kitchen, and every few seconds a server would come out and yell \"order\", my rating however has nothing to do with the above, I just am not a big fan of sports bar and had to say that as a disclaimer.   Came in with my friend and his parents, we ordered a bottle of zin which was great and I ordered a turkey burger, my friend ordered a romaine wedge with grilled chicken, his parents ordered the lamb chops and Isabelle's chicken.   My turkey burger with sweet potato fries was amazing, from what I noticed of my friend's parents they liked their meals. My friend had the romaine salad with chicken. The chicken was most likely pre-made, and it was super dry. My friend asked for another and they were pretty fast and got him a side of chicken and it was newly made and good.   Server was nice and checked on us a couple of times. I will come back to this place only if I was to engage in some sports game viewing."}
{"text":"We were at this restaurant last night and had their Bourbon Bar B Que chicken wings.  We have been here many times and had their hamburgers and they were very good so we thought we would try something new.  That was our big mistake.  The wings were not very good and as I discovered today I have spent most of the day on the toilet.  Sorry for being blunt but that is just the way it was!  I am not sure if the cooks there wash their hands or not or if they do not keep their kitchen clean enough, but there are only a few options for the poor quality of food to cause this kind of situation.  It leaves me to pause whether to purchase food there again.  It is a nice place to hang out and have drinks with friends but I can't recommend their food.  Eat the wings at your own risk."}
{"text":"The very best sports bar, bar food, drinks and sports bar atmosphere in Arizona.  The service, ambiance and massive amount of TVs make this place a dream come true for sports fans, not to mention the beautiful outdoor seating.  Just make sure to come early during football season or you'll lose your spot."}
{"text":"This Sports Bar is FAR & AWAY the BEST!  How many spiders bars have you been to, where they have: A Great Wine List, a Full Bar, More tv's than I can count - inside and out; a great menu selection...Seriously? Oh - and try going to a Cardinals game there! The ONLY sound they turn on is THAT game - although a very few of the tv's are showing whatever, other games are on at the same time. (Very Few!) The crowd is delightful. People are talking football at the bar seats...Even families go - because the menu is priced right!  You can make a RESERVATION here, too... Now I am feeling slightly uncomfortable because if too many of you show up, I might not get my favorite seat!! It's not too big, and kind of feels like CHEERS after you've gone a few times and you notice lots of familiar faces. Once you've tried this spot, it will be your favorite, too. Just save room for me!"}
{"text":"Updated review:  much better! Last time got subpar service from the bartender. This time got excellent service. Good atmosphere.  Burger was slightly under my 'medium' request but delicious. My friend had the passion fruit margarita and loved it.  Overall a great place for a beer and some grub. Will return."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this sports bar & what a nice surprise! Great atmosphere, beautiful & clean. Food was fabulous & fast. Recommend the Isabella chicken & pomegranate margarita. Servers were all very friendly too. Next time we're back from Oregon, this will be a must stop."}
{"text":"The building itself is beautiful - both inside and out. The entrance is a large ornate wood door that leads into an open space with tall ceilings. There are booths, a modern bar with glass shelves, and rustic wood paneling on the walls. Even the bathrooms are beautiful! I honestly love how it is decorated. I guess I am mostly surprised that a sports bar is decorated in such a manner. Yes, it is a sports bar. It is probably the prettiest sports bar I have ever laid eyes on. It is also the only sports bar I've ever seen that has TVs lining every single wall. There are so many TVs, the place could save electricity by forgoing the use of lamps and simply light the place by the glow of the TVs.   Unfortunately, the food was just okay. Mainly it was bar fare - burgers, wings, etc. with some modern twists/flare. The soup of the day was asparagus soup - not typical bar fare but they did have chili on the menu. There were salads but nothing crazy. The burgers all sounded typical with some avocado thrown in. My husband ordered the chicken sandwich, I ordered the turkey burger, and my sister-in-law ordered the California burger. All three of us ordered sweet potato fries. The fries were good but nothing to write home about. I didn't try the chicken sandwich nor the CA burger but the overall verdict was just okay. My turkey burger was super thin and dry. The flavor was nice, but not something I'd order again. Since we all ordered burgers, as we ate our dinner, we wished we went to a burger joint instead.    Overall, I don't think I'll be back. The food quality isn't what I expected (yes, it is a sports bar but it is a high end sports bar) and for the quality of food, I don't want to pay high end prices. I do love the décor/design but I feel like it misses the mark as a sports bar and can't decide which way it wants to swing."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE Service. Not accommodating. I would not recommend to even my worst enemy. Also, would not put on requested games for numerous customers."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and always prompt on time. The have very young fit attractive food runners and occasionally lethargic busers. However, the service is always dodgy. Occasionally, you receive a great server and sometimes an awful one. Been coming here since they have opened. It's became a regular spot for my family and I. I have to recommend the Cajun chicken alfredo to all."}
{"text":"We had our rehearsal wedding dinner here on Friday June 17th and it was amazing! The food was great, the atmosphere and the service was AMAZING! Such a great patio! This place is awesome! All the food is wonderful, but I especially love the cheese curds and steak salad!!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and the service is top notch the manager could not be nicer I don't know who the other peoples reviews were talking about and they have a great selection of drinks they just got a bottle of Jack Daniels Sinatra century there are only 36 bottles in the state. I had the Isabel's chicken which is amazing.  The place was busy and the service was still pretty quick. It's a great place to go watch sports and also casual enough to go have a nice dinner with the family or maybe a date. The wine cellar is stunning and the patio area is super nice. All in all I will definitely be coming back and strongly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great place to hangout. The food is 20 times better than the Livingroom's food and there are actually places to sit.  The area is large open and very stylish.  Happy they opened and give us DC Ranch residence a nice place to be besides the Livingroom!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! We visited Phoenix for a graduation ceremony and came here for a few drinks and an appetizer. I absolutely loved the layout, decor and patio setup. It was super hot outside, but we were still about to enjoy the patio thanks to some well placed fans. The bartenders were incredibly knowledgeable about their bourbon selection and on top of our drink refills. We had chicken wings tossed in teriyaki sauce. They were crispy and had great flavor. The patio could use a few more tv's, but I am a brat and want them everywhere lol. All in all, this is a great place for an after work drink or to watch a game. I'm disappointed we didn't have dinner here."}
{"text":"Great Bartender (Shannon) friendly, helpful & attentive.  Food is very good; Happy Hour prices (11-6) m-f. Wings are flavorful,  Caprese Salad is delicious ,ask Shannon for suggestion about how tup get the salad ;) Pulled pork sliders are awesome, Buffalo Shrimp mouth watering.  Very chill place, check it out."}
{"text":"Love this place . Great food, great staff . The sliders are terrific and the large patio is perfect for football Sunday !"}
{"text":"Super place. Crab cakes, awesome!  Omg chicken sandwich, awesome!  The trio, awesome! I'm impressed with the layout, the service and awesome food! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars for quick service, friendly wait staff, good burgers and live music. Howerver, the live music was a tad too loud to hold any type of decent conversation if seated in the main restaurant. Sit on the patio or by the front entrance to avoid the loudness. This is a sports bar, so in all fairness, we expected it to be loud. The margarita was not the best I've ever had but wasn't the worst either. They make their own sweet sour mix so that is an issue that needs to be tweaked. The California burger was very tasty as was the mushroom burger. There are plenty of flat screens to enjoy different sports or bikini contests. Parking can be an issue in weekends during peak hours."}
{"text":"Great service Brock and our bartender, Izzy!  The happy hour was great. The burger was awesome! We will be back and bringing our friends."}
{"text":"Was there for the soft opening.  Atmosphere was amazing.  Staff not so much.  Bartender has no clue how to run a successful bar.  She needs serious training.  Your customers are more important than schmoozing with your staff.  Also, you never dip a glass in the ice to fill it.  Another server skill she lacks.  Other servers deliver there drinks holding the glass at the rim. Just another server violation.  The manager never came around to ask how things were, he was more in his own little world. I couldn't understand this place as they have another location in Fountain Hills that is top notch.  Someone dropped the ball! Items on the menu were not available, prices were ridiculous, staff were inadequate.  Too bad.  D C Ranch area is in need of a good reasonable hangout, but unless drastic measures are taken, this place will be a memory just like the last few. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Austin is a great bartender ! Nice atmosphere, decent food and great beer."}
{"text":"Food is ok, over priced. Service completely sucks. Food takes forever to get to you. There are so many other great options, skip this joint and head across the street for some great Mexican food."}
{"text":"This is a cohesive review from our party of four.  Cleanliness- 5 stars.   Atmosphere- 5 stars from the ones who like sports. There are tons of tvs; an outside seating area with booths, tables, and high tops, a smoking lounge, and fire place. We were able to sit outside on January first very comfortably.   Service- 5 stars. Our waitress was extremely personable and quick. She cleared our table in a timely manner so that the table wasn't cluttered. Drinks and apps within a reasonable time.   Food selection- tough... A person in our party is allergic to chicken. Aside from a burger he didn't have many options. However, for those of us that frequent sports bar.. The selection was on point. Wings, spinach artichoke dip, burgers, sandwiches, chili, salads. All dishes we love while watching a game. Draft Beer selection was disappointing. I wanted a simple light ale and there was only one option (which I liked) but would have loved to see more options. However, it is a bourbon bar so I realize that in this critique.   Food- 4 stars. Not overwhelmingly great. But not bad. Seemed a tad pricey for a casual sports bar but it is located in Scottsdale so no surprise there."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Its super laid back and its perfect for Sunday Football! They have tons of TVs & seating-- indoor & outdoors . The drinks were good and so was the service. Because this is a new place, I heard the food is iffy. Hopefully, it gets better cuz this place has great potential!"}
{"text":"This place was totally legit. Scottsdale's longest happy hour by a long shot. Daily happy hour specials from 11:00-9:00. Wings are pretty damn tasty. Good prices. Awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"Took my Father in-law. We both had a Caesar salad. He had it with Shrimp and I had mine with Grilled Chicken. Both were excellent !! Our server, Victoria was knowledgeable, friendly and efficient. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Awesome spot for NFL football on Sunday.  They have plenty of TVs to get all the morning games on.  Someone even mentioned that it was a Dallas Cowboys bar."}
{"text":"Ugh. They're new so I wouldn't write them off just yet but there's a lot of work to do here. Food is okay, service is deplorable, slow and confused. Even the greeter was dull. Great looking space but there are so many better choices close by unless these folks can get their act together."}
{"text":"The food is really good! I ordered the Moroccan Salmon, and it was fantastic! The spices were just the right amount, the salmon wasn't over cooked, the quinoa and salad was a great accompaniment. They have a great wine menu; especially for a sports bar.   Speaking of being a sports bar, there are TVs everywhere, and the noise level is fairly high. However, you still can hold on a conversation, which is nice. Our server was a little on the slow side, but it was pretty crowded this evening; so he had his hands full.   All in all, I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Best said, a very upscale sports bar..... ish, kinda feel like it could be a wine bar!  Food is good, not great.  Service was great.  Would certainly return especially when the weather permits a patio spot, great place!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing new upscale sports bar / restaurant at DC Ranch Market Street!  The food was great (I had the Southwest Burger and Mild Wings) and the staff was very friendly.  I'll be back every week!"}
{"text":"We used to love this place but the little girls who serve as hostesses aren't up to the task. They need some slightly older (maybe over 18??) hostesses or hosts there. The girls have been rude and unprofessional. We hope to see some higher caliber personnel at the front. If we hear of that happening, we will be back. Until then, they can giggle and whisper amongst themselves."}
{"text":"Second time here.  They are still working out the kinks.  Food is good, nice atmosphere.  Prices are a bit high.  Drinks are coming out slow.  They have to kill the smoking on the patio.  With the doors open all around, the whole restaurant smells bad.  My wife said she won't come back because of that.  I'm still optimistic, but they had better kill that smoking lounge!  Need a kids menu also...  Let's go guys.  We need you up here...  Update:  So we finished dining.  Here is the final review as we won't be back.  Food: Happy Hour sliders, HH quesadilla, kids meal, (2) cheap wines, (3) draft beers.  Total=$76.00 plus tip.  No thanks!  The service was slow.  Our server had tables at the back of the house and front door.  Sections anyone?  My beer sat at the bar for 10 minutes while I stared at it...  . We now have to wash our clothes when we get home for the first time since AZ passed the no smoking ban.  Whole restaurant reeked of cigarette and cigar smoke.  The place just seemed disorganized.  On the way out, two guys walking next to us said they sat at the bar and the prices were ridiculous.  They laughed and said they won't be back.  They went to The Living Room next door.  Too bad.  I had high hopes for the place.  The owner obviously thinks North Scottsdale will pay those prices, but he needs to understand that if they do, they expect a stellar experience and service.  They had better step it up.  They are a sports bar!"}
{"text":"Nice place to get some upscale pub fare.  Took some clients out to dinner here to watch the Sunday night NFL games, have a glass of wine, good conversation, and good food---all items were accomplished. The food was great. I ordered the pork loin with crispy sweet potatoes and asparagus along with a side salad. The side salad was a meal in and of itself (huge!) and they make their own salad dressings so it was a treat to enjoy. The pork loin was served over a sweet brown sugar sauce (don't remember what it was exactly) that paired well with the sweet potato. Everyone around the table enjoyed the burger, the Cajun pasta, and soups and salads. Great place to sit outside and enjoy the games on a Sunday night."}
{"text":"Tried to watch ASU vs UofA BBall Game and was told they couldn't put it on. Clue in, you are a sports bar. Support local teams! You'll need locals this summer...."}
{"text":"I know this is short but somethings can be described in one word. \"WOW\".  I digress...if you love a great hamburger this place has an amazingly flavorable, hit the spot, add to my favorite list, lip smacking cheeseburger. I am definitely coming back for seconds!"}
{"text":"DOG FRIENDLY PATIO! One of the main reasons we frequent this restaurant.  Our little princess is one the go with us.  We've been here without her as well, and since we are moving back to this neighborhood it's perfect,especially with football season on the approach!   This is one of the best sports bar/restaurants around.   LOTS of televisions and great bars!!  It's an upscale environment for all.  It's also on Open Table which we use quite frequently.  However, our experience on Saturday Sept 3 we were a bit disappointed in some areas.  It seems they were having a major training day for servers.  A lot of attention.  Too much.  Except when needed.  As I had to eventually get up from our wonderful and comfortable misters outside to go inside to ask to reduce the volume on the oh-so-loud tv's.  We were the only ones on the patio and the football games were very loud that we couldn't hear each other!  As I tried to get back into the booth, I knocked over my wine glass.  ( GASP ) we sat for a bit before our 'team' of servers arrived.  We asked for more napkins as ours were wet from the spill.  We informed them what happened.  The new server took the plate of wet napkins and brought new, but never asked to refill the spilled glass.  We later asked for another. ( there was a bit in the glass that didn't spill )  We had the chips/guac/salsa appetizer.  Since they were constantly hovering we opted to wait to order the main course.  The app came out very fast.  It was around 5-530pm when we arrived and not yet busy.  As a former server, I understand the concept of training, however too much is too much.  We finally ordered the salmon and split it.  There were a few female servers that came out and brought our princess a big bowl of water.  Several of the servers came out to greet our pup.  Very dog friendly.    The food was great as usual.  I had informed the servers  that we had an Open Table reservation for about 30 min later than we arrived.  Only to find out this morning that they canceled it instead of checking us in.  The $ 82.05 late lunch/early dinner for the ADDED glass of wine that was spilled did not thrill us.  We dine out 4-5 times a week, and never have we been charged for a spill.  We didn't challenge it, but will certainly mention it on our next trip in.  One added bonus was the \"Mike\" who was one of our favorite bar team members from another restaurant we use to frequent before it closed with only 24 hours notice to their staff ( boo to them.. ) is now a member of All American.  YAY.. he saw us from inside and came out to the patio to say hello.  We will be back, however they have a few things to work on here.  It's a wonderful place and perhaps this was an 'off' day.  Just glad it wasn't our first or second experience. It's an attractive, fun and energetic as well as  tasty place to dine.   We WILL be back.  They will be having breakfast/brunch on Sundays  in regular football season, however the servers didn't say the mimosas/bloody mary's would be on special or unlimited, like so many nearby restaurants.  Sunday is our 'funday' and we hope they change that idea here esp during football season."}
{"text":"Such a cute place with a variety on their menu. Always had great service but usually get same server over lunch hour (Kali works really hard and is friendly). Kind of pricey but that's what you get for market street (4 stars for price). I enjoy their salads and sandwiches for lunch."}
{"text":"I bet most people don't think of All American Modern Sports Grill as the place for great salads but it is. The Asian salad is amazingly healthy, delicious; I always add an avocado. The servers are very good and they have my favorite type of wine: Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand.  I watch Da Bears at this bar now since my Cave Creek bar remodeled in a way to let all of the cigarette smoke come inside.  Da Bears, healthy food and Down Under wine with no cigarette smoke.... Life is good in North Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"TV management is ran by cavemen. I dont want to rip this place apart. But after today I will never be back. Or recommend. Changed a game with two minutes left and refused to put it back on. Just 1 of 5 reasons. Mind blown"}
{"text":"I love this new sports bar in DC Ranch. I really like the whole DC Ranch vibe. I've been here twice for lunch now and both times I've had the burger and it has been fantastic. Once the weather warms up I would like to come back and sit at the patio. The only thing I would say it takes a bit to get your food even when there not that busy. Which I think they will overcome that since they just recently opened. Besides that the restaurant is beautiful."}
{"text":"Good variety of food if your looking for a bit of everything! Service was good and hostess was there ready to seat us the moment we walked in!"}
{"text":"So disappointed in my second visit here. No way was this visit worthy of 5 stars. First they serve tap water probably because they want you to pay for drinks but then their cocktails aren't great either. We ordered a Moscow Mule and the taste ginger beer was so over powering it was awful. I should have turned it back in; certainly not worth the money. Then I ordered the quinoa and kale salad nothing else on it and my daughter had the quinoa and kale salad with chicken and despite the fact that the restaurant was almost empty it took over 1/2 hour to get our food. Our server was pleasant but with all the restaurants in North Scottsdale there is no reason to return."}
{"text":"The worst for those that don't like smoke. The smoking area is dead center of patio. The venting made no difference couldn't escape the smoke. Awful experience :("}
{"text":"Best ever. Such a hidden gem, service was a 10. food amazing, hot and not microwaved.Service friendly to the point where you would want to be friends with them outside the restaurant. Love it. Love it. Love it!"}
