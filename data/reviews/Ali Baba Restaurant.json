{"text":"I visited this Lebanese Restaurant with a Vegetarian Meetup Group on May 19, 2012 and am just now getting around to doing this review. Ali Baba's owner and chef, Linda, host's this Meetup group about once a month. Ali Baba is a small place and does not accept credit or debit cards or have a web site. Ali Baba is an independent, family owned and run kind of operation, the best-kept culinary secret in town. It's as good a Lebanese place as you're going to find and the best I've ever had.  Don't let the location, exterior, and/or interior of the restaurant keep you from eating here. The food is great and it was a great deal. It was $15 for this Vegan meal which was served family style, passing the serving dishes down the table, and it included water or tea, tax, and tip. The menu for our dinner was chef's choice, which featured dishes which were prepared with produce from the owner's own garden from what I was told. The food here was absolutely delicious and I couldn't believe it was only fifteen bucks!  A few of my favorite and more memorable items were the Falafel and Early Summer Stew. I really didn't evaluate the service during this meal because it was served family style and the drinks were self-serve. I enjoyed the good conversational buzz punctuated with plenty of 'yums'.  This Meetup group meets once a month at this restaurant and is limited to 20 people. You may RSVP for the next one at the following link: http://www.meetup.com/vegetarian-367."}
{"text":"Picked up take out from here for the first time. I've known about this place for years and don't know what I waited for. I asked if there was a special and it was a stewed lamb with broad beans and tomatoes. Delicious! It came with steamed rice and a salad with an excellent dressing and pita bread, I can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
