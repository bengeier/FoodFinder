{"text":"Service is poor. Food is pathetic. A very small portion of pasta charged me for 20 dollars."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night.  The food was delicious the tortellini was amazing. The portion size needs to be bigger. The atmosphere was nice. Wait staff need to be more professional.I would definitely go back because it is still new and hopefully it will get better with time. It has a lot of potential."}
{"text":"Went to check out this place on a Saturday evening. Was blown away by the decor, thought it was an art gallery (and it used to be). Beautiful place, feels like you are somewhere in Paris or London. But that's where the good review ends. Our waiter came by, introduced himself and asked if we needed anything. So far so good. We ordered drinks and he went to get them. 20 mins later, he comes over (no drinks) and tell us that the bar is busy making drinks for a big table that just came in (um, I think we were first and the only drink that required making for our table was one cocktail - the rest were open a bottle and pour). So anyway, finally the drinks arrive and my glass of prosecco was a bit warm (I guess it was standing there for a while). The cocktail that my boyfriend ordered was tasty. Then we ordered the food and had to wait for that to arrive (except for the salad which arrived pretty fast and was good). The black ink pasta that we ordered was good, however the duck pizza was lacking in flavour big time! After we were done, we were sitting with empty plates for a while, even though there were lots of waiters in the restaurant who kept walking by us and not clearing the plates. Our waiter abandoned us because he was busy with the big table of guys. Finally a manager came by himself and cleared our table which was very nice of him. We wanted to get coffee but had to wait another 20 min! When our waiter showed up we asked for espresso and cappuccino.  When he came by with espresso he slipped and spilled it on my friend.  He felt very bad and tried to clean up the mess as quickly as he can and brought a new one right away. HOWEVER, they still charged my friend for it AND didn't offer to clean his jeans or even not charge him for a meal as the coffee was very hot and burned him a bit. WOW, I was blown away. We were so nice about him spilling the drink, but they didn't do anything about fixing the situation. For that reason will not be coming back! In summary, the place is beautiful, the food needs more work (keep in mind it's just another Italian restaurant so they should find a way to stand out), the service needs major make over! Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Went here with a girl friend on a Thursday night. We were greeted by the sleazy Italian owner with a hand shake - way too personal for my liking and just not necessary.  Our waiter was the WORST! Totally inappropriate, making jokes about boning his ex-boyfriends. Again, just not necessary. Every single time he came to our table he harped on about being so tired and stressed out as he was the only one working his section, which to be fair was half the restaurant. But seriously, we were just two girls out for a nice quiet dinner to catch up after a tough week at work and did we really need to hear all about how crap his night was? Well no we didn't. Food quality was good, but the whole sea bass was a bit of a nightmare, it came with an annoying amount of brown paper sticking out from the plate making it extremely difficult to eat. AND I had to wait 10 mins for the waiter to do a terrible job of deboning it, at our table, while my friend's dinner went cold.  If you're thinking about going here then just don't. Head to Reds Midtown, or Scaddabush, which are 5 mins away and have far better (professional) service, with no sleazy owners trying to shake your hand."}
{"text":"One star for ambiance and good service, but that's about it...you definitely pay a premium for it. $26 for a risotto that was tiny, undercooked, watery. Here's a tip: make sure you ask for sand on the side, instead of in your artichokes. Go to Tosto Quickfire down the road instead. Waaay better."}
{"text":"Typical, overpriced, pretentious downtown Toronto resto. Get the pizza because pasta servings are laughably tiny (think tinier than appetizer size...except $16). Salads come in heartier portions!   Service was also a little sad. Missing cutlery, empty water glasses, and spotty attention.   It's a new restaurant, but it made me miss Montreal's food scene."}
{"text":"I like to give restaurants a shot regardless of mixed reviews because it could be they just had an off night but I just confirmed what one review said. HORRIBLE SERVICE. The place was 75% empty and it took forever to get our food or even a refill of water. 45 minute wait From when we ordered until the apps came and another 45 between that and the main course. The waiter had me handing him my plates every time or him handing me my plates. The food was mediocre but the quality of service is what's going to be the end of this place. Never going back."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I've been here twice, and I am amazed both times. Looking from the outside?this place is like a mini art gallery. Dishes here are reeeally special and tasty, you must check out the beef cheeks pasta and the 38oz steak! The fried eggplants also worth a try! Last but not the least, the servers here provide quality assistance with our experience with a caring attitude. They are really sweet. Do not hesitate anymore! Walk in that place! Lolol"}
{"text":"Via Vai is absolutely beautiful and the food matches that. I had an outstanding dinner. Everything we had was very good and the services was amazing. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Order delivery through the app they promote:maegan Ordered a marinara pizza with prosciuto and parmesan, got a pizza with anchovies and no cheese- called Via Vau to tell them about the error, was told by Marie that she knew the app had an old menu, that they could not give me a new pizza and that i should contact the app customer service for a refund... Wtf? If you promote your business and the app and there is an error, it is no the customer's fault, really shameful and disrespectful."}
{"text":"I came in for dinner tonight with my boyfriend and we were thoroughly unimpressed. Service was inconsistent and had a hard time gaining our waitress' attention. My bf and I were halfway through our appetizers when we noticed our two entrees were cooked and sitting under a heat lamp. The food runner brought us the pizza and pasta but we told here we went ready for entrees and she looked stunned and turned around. Then the sous chef tried to bring us the food and we turned him away. Finally, our waitress came back again and we told her we wanted to get fresh entrees. Her immediate response was \"because it's been sitting out for three minutes?!\", when in actuality it had been well over 10 minutes. No restaurant should be serving customers dry cold food and not even acknowledging they made in error with timing."}
{"text":"Personally, I really enjoyed it. The chef came out and asked about the food. Service was great and food was tasty! They serve a Neapolitan pizza. The crust almost has a naan flavour to it. I really liked it.  Ordered: Italian breakfast: 4/5 Fried Eggplant cheese sandwich (can't remember the name): 3.5/5 Ndaja pizza: 4/5 Funghi pizza: 4.5/5 Pistachio cake: 5/5  It's great for a date night, really trendy decor."}
{"text":"We were turned away pretty abruptly for Sunday brunch as they were only offering a single option prix fix menu with no vegetarian alternative. In a city like Toronto, it's pretty astonishing that they wouldn't at least offer a salad or something. We asked the waitress if she could check with the chef about making the main without meat, to which he apparently refused."}
{"text":"A nice little place with fantastic ambiance. I love the art decor and long glass windows. They provide a nice clean contrast to the more rustic Italian cuisine they sell. The food is fantastic, with a decent-sized menu of various pizzas, pastas, meats, etc. The place is a little cramped (consequence of being in such a tight space), but the table's provide quite a bit of space for you and your friends/family/date/whoever you brought.   The only complaint would be the staff. I'm not sure if this is due to lack of staff or lack of training, but the service was sparse. After telling the staff to wait a little longer for the rest of the guests to arrive, they seem to take this as a cue to just not check on us for far too long. There weren't many tables to serve so I'm not sure why we only saw our server maybe three times throughout the evening.   The food is fantastic and the ambiance is on point. But the service needs a little work."}
{"text":"Simply loved the food! The pizza was amazing. The space was also great, with beautiful artwork hanging from the ceiling -- would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Great food and a well curated instagram don't make up for the dreadful service."}
{"text":"Okay service but terrible portions and bad overall cleanliness... After seeing the washrooms at the end of my visit, I would not want to eat here. Came in for lunch with a friend, 2 other tables in the restaurant had guests. I think the other table was a group of managers , as they didn't order anything but still took up most of the servers attentions. We ordered a pasta and pizza.... much too expensive for the pasta, and the pizza was burnt. Also , upon entering I noticed a terrible odour in the restaurant, thought maybe it was food and did not want to insult my friend who made the date.  The server did great, but I felt bad for him having to work in such a terrible smell! Overall I wont return."}
{"text":"Food: 6.5/10 Atmosphere: 8/10  Service: 7/10 Overall experience: 7/10  I had a really fantastic experience with Via Vai. I celebrated my birthday at the venue this past summer, and the team was amazingly accommodating. We went in a couple of times to taste the food and put together a custom cocktail for the event, really going above and beyond what other places would do (aka just taking your reservation and charging you a minimum of $50 a head!)  The day of the event ran really smoothly. Food came out promptly, and they were so kind as to provide a round of champagne on the house for a birthday toast.   I would tend to agree with other reviewers that the food is not the BEST (if you're looking to truly amazing Italian food, hit up Enoteca Sociale), however it is still generally good food and priced fairly. For me and my birthday experience, what they lacked in flavour, they more than made up for in service and overall experience.   THE BOTTOM LINE: though the food falls short of other very popular Italian spots, had a birthday experience that will keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday party of 16 and we had a price dice menu that the chef created for us. Kale salad to start was good but nothing to write home about. We were given 4 pizzas to share with the entire table and I quite liked it. They were good but I still prefer pizza libretto. The crusts were good and I usually hate crust. Gnocchi was a good texture but the sauce tasted like it came straight from the can. We had some butternut squash ravioli that another diner described as tasting like an \"old fashioned timbit\"- I did not like the ravioli at all. Dessert was tiramisu which was good but it was served with a berry compote which was strange but I didn't mind it.   The worst part of this place was the staff. Our server only had one machine and when I asked him for another machine for the rest of the table and he said something like how the other machine needed to be left free, which was ridiculous. And then when two friends asked to macgyver their bills, he basically didn't know how to use the POS and had to go back to the main computer to redo the bills for them. It took us forever to leave!  I think this place has a lot of potential but unfortunately just falls short."}
{"text":"Fancy on the outside, disappointment on the inside. Service was terrible. The waitress was completely absent for our entire meal. She brings our San Pellegrino bottle and proceed to pour it from a ridiculous height and angle and splashes water all over the table and onto our hands resting on the table. This was the last time she served us. Oh hey, it's been 45 mins, shouldn't our pizza be ready by now? Anyone? Anyone? Waitress? Beuller? It's not like I have a job to get back to at 12:45pm on a Tuesday. Let's just try and ask anyone that works here. Random waitress returns to let us know our pizza is in the oven now and should be out soon (i.e. we just put your order in, please wait a few more minutes). 10 minutes later, we took it to go, got a discount and will be the last time I step foot in this dive. It turns out even the food was mediocre. When compared to my go to Pizzeria Libretto, the pizza here is garbage. I'm pretty sure the sauce is straight from a can. If you're not close to Libretto (there's a new one at King/University!) and you want something a little better than Pizza Pizza, and you don't feel like waiting in line at Tosto (Bay/College), and you feel like overpaying for a disappointing meal, Via Vai is where you need to be right now. Oh hey, I heard the washrooms are nice. So... woo!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly disappointing.  It was between Via Vai or Tosto Quickfire down the street for a bite at lunch. Looks upscale and appealing, but it does not a reflect the poor service guests receive.   The moment I walked in with my company, servers/hosts were on their phones or busy behind the counter. The restaurant only had 3 other tables seated. There was no reason to have ignored us. I was ready to walk out at this point to go down to Tosto.  The menu is decent, but not anything that would WOW you or set it apart from other Italian eateries in TO. I ordered the carbonara and the Margarita pizza. Least to say - my pizza came out doughy, and soggy in the middle. It was incredibly salty for a pizza which was the saving grace for that dish. The carbonara pasta was soft, the pasta did not come out al dente, the sauce was flavourless, the only good about that dish was the pancetta. Overall, the food is 2/5.  Service 1.5/5 - unattentive service. Servers are on their phones in public, I had to try for 10 minutes to wave a server down to get our orders in.   Would not return. Don't let the look of the restaurant fool you."}
{"text":"Since seeing this GORGEOUS restaurant featured in Toronto Life, I had to try.  First off, Via Vai is a lovely designed restaurant: tall ceilings featuring glass walls all around and modern artwork. I kind of wish the cuisine matched the décor as Via Vai is listed as a pizzeria and the atmosphere, despite its expensive-looking interior, is casual.  I had made reservations on Open Table for 3 at 6:45, but my parents and I happened to be in the area for 5:50. We decided to go in and see if they had space.   WARNING!  Try and avoid the communal-like tables to the right of the restaurant (when you enter) with the back-less seats. First of all, the space between each seat and other tables are minimal, which means it would get very uncomfortable having people/waiters push behind you. We were initially brought to these tables, but my mom said her back wouldn't allow it and we got a table with regular chairs instead.   The menu is simple and we of course got the pizza's. Verdict is a-ok. Nothing to cry about, but certainly a notch up or two than Pizza Pizza. My Tortellini was so, so disappointing: the pasta skin was dry and hard. The waitress indicated to me that because of the complaints, all the pasta dishes (except the Tortellini which had 5 or 6 pieces) had been made bigger. We also ordered the fish which is brought whole to you; it can be deboned for you (but as a Chinese person, I know how to debone my own fish!). Fish was great - but again, it was simply steamed and at $22, I thought it was priced very reasonable.  Desserts again are few and simple: One Tiramisu (good), one dense chocolate cake of some sort (ok, but too heavy and rich for me), and the third item I forgot.  The Wine list is what you would expect for an Italian restaurant - our table ordered a lovely Valpolicella and because I was loving my wines so much, I ordered two glasses of other various Reds.  Service was great - by the time we left the restaurant, 7:30-8ish, the restaurant was full so reservations are recommended. I am glad we came to the restaurant early because no \"regular\" tables were available.  Overall, I am glad I tried this place out. I don't think I would necessarily make it a point to come back here for dinner: the food was really average. But, this is a great drinks place and the bar is lovely. Would definitely come here with my girls for a glass (or botella) di vino."}
{"text":"Even with Reds just a few short blocks away at Yonge & Gerrard, Via Vai will be my new go-to for a nicer dinner or after-dinner drinks in the Bay/College area. It's not \"fine dining\" by any means, and fits in the classic toronto \"casual fine dining\" genre, but lets just say I wouldn't be comfortable walking into there in sweatpants.   From the leather benches and table tops to the cutlery and wine shelf, the all-white decor takes a leaf out of Solange Knowles' wedding. On first glance, you'll find the space similar to the Momofuku complex on University. The restaurant is housed in a floor-to-ceiling glass box, a couple community tables, and bright sunlight streaming in during the day, it's a similar vibe to Shoto. Being said, there's a definite unique twist brought by the massive artwork installations, graffiti-ed cement (and noticeable lack of hipsters).  Cocktails are priced very reasonably ($10-15), and obviously there is an extensive wine list. On the cocktail front, there's nothing revolutionary going on here, but the \"Italian Garden\" was refreshing and tasted like spring. The \"Italian Breakfast\" was a twist on an Old Fashioned, but for what should have been a classic cocktail, fell a little flat.  The meat and cheese platter offered a great selection, and came with fried dough sticks, some apple, and fig slices, some pickles, and pureed accompaniments. We tried the Funghi pizza and pacceri pasta. The pizza was served hot, thin, and crispy, right out of the wood pizza oven, was topped with a great blend of various mushrooms, and had none of the greasiness that seems to plague white pizzas across Toronto. The pasta is the only reason why Via Vai isn't getting a five rating here. The sauce packed a spicy, garlicy punch, but the pacceri pasta itself seemed doughy and undercooked.  The service here is attentive and friendly, and as the evening progresses, the space naturally gets darker and becomes the perfect place to catch up with your girls over a glass of wine, or continue your date with some after-dinner drinks. Despite the undercooked pasta, I'll be looking forward to trying the branzino and the tirimisu at my next visit.   HHHH - four hedgehogs out of five bit.ly/1dIcPdw"}
{"text":"DONT GO!!! There's really nothing special about this restaurant. Portions were extremely small, pricy but not tasty. We had a large party of 20 and was ordering from their fixed price menu. The salmon came in different sizes, some were much smaller than the others. Their \"aged steak\" was totally average, something I can pull off in my own kitchen. It was the size of a deck of cards and was  cooked to \"well-done\" instead of medium rare, which we asked. When we complaint to sent it back, they said there was no more steak in the kitchen!   Their tiramisu was the biggest embarrassment. They dare to serve a tiramisu with the size of HALF a lady finger size. It was smaller than a bite-full and some were served toppled.  Their service was also very poor; one server spilt water all over the table and almost hit my friends face with the jug (and did not apologize). We were forced to pay 20% tip because of the size of our group on the account of poor food and services.   One star too much."}
{"text":"Very artsy ambiance. Love the high ceilings and the super tall tower of wine shelves! The service was so friendly and enthusiastic.  Squid Ink Risotto | Squid ink, shrimp, cuttlefish, octopus, duck egg and truffle salt - I've only been seeing Squid Ink Pasta in Toronto. Luckily, I found a place that does Squid Ink Risotto finally! It's a Secret though... sooo shhh!  It's not on their menu, but Chef Joe Friday will whip it up upon request.  The risotto was perfectly aldente. The seafood were cooked to perfection. The entire mix of it all with the duck egg was just unreal and takes me back to Italy.  Funghi Pizza | Oyster mushroom, fontina cream and sage - Loved this pizza! Have always been a big fan of Neapolitan Pizza so I'm happy I found another amazing place aside from Libretto.  Garden of Eden | Sponge cake base, blueberry balsamic panna cotta, 72-hr dehydrated chocolate, Apple puree, strawberry cream sauce, and lemon poppy seed chip  - Such a creative and artful dessert with very distinct mix of ingredients. Love that it reminds me of Molecular Gastronomy! On its own there's nothing much but mix it all around and you get something delicious and unique. You get something sweet, sour, bitter, crunchy and chewy."}
{"text":"Via Vai is an upscale yet casual restaurant in the heart of downtown Toronto. It is one of the most beautiful venues I have seen in the city. With very large ceilings the restaurant has incredible art pieces all along the wall with hanging art installations & a beautiful tall wine rack which nears the ceiling top. The menu is Italian food which is delicious, well priced, and tasty! The venue is very clean, spacious, can hold large groups, and is a great place for business lunches/dinners, events, or just for a classy dinner. The staff are great too! The Chef Joe Friday is especially good! Such a dedicated chef providing excellent food & a culinary experience.   A definite must!"}
{"text":"Stunning restaurant. The white / atmosphere very beautiful. The ceilings / hanging art - very cool. I came with my family on a saturday night. The waiters were attentive and the food was great - pizza / pasta / salads were all had. The pizza was actually top notch. The only downside was the wine list prices - a little on the steep side (no bottles under $50)."}
{"text":"The Pappardelle was the worse experience I've had with pasta. The texture was rough and watery base. It almost seems like the pasta was not drained properly. The ricotta was separate chucks on the top of the pasta, where it seems like you have to mix yourself. Presentation and taste was poorly done. The service was not pleasant. After I send it back, the waitress asked if I wanted to pack it to go? Very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Came here with my team at work. About 20 of us. Pizza was cold and meager toppings. Food took too long to come. Complete incompetence from the wait staff.  Our hour lunch turned into almost 3 hours... waiter didn't inform us of the 18% automatic gratuity. Bills were mixed up.  Food was less than mediocre. The spot is cool looking but that's where the positives stop. Would not recommend. Go to Tosto's right around the corner."}
{"text":"Really liked the look of the place. The chefs special octopus platter to share was amazing. Executive Chef Joe Friday actually came out and talked to us which just enhanced the restaurant experience. The food was delicious and reasonably priced for downtown Toronto. Will definitely come back. So many things I want to try :)"}
{"text":"The decor was stunning no doubt about that. Service was really good starting at the door to the table. Pizza was good, but not as good as I hoped for. The salad was good too. The Tiramisu desert was a bit too dry for my liking and not very flavourful (and this is coming from someone who has traveled to Italy and had the best Tiramisu). The menu is not large so you don't get overwhelmed trying to find something to eat. Definitely would go back and try something new."}
{"text":"Mixed reviews left me wondering what this stunning looking restaurant is all about. One way to find out - try it. I took advantage of Summerlicious $18 lunch deal and took the plunge.  As stated before, this is a gorgeous place architecturally. The service was excellent and attentive.  First course was salad and I tried \"Insalata Via Vai\". I was not disappointed. It was quite flavourful. For main course, I picked \"Marinara\" pizza. It was quite good but not spectacular. For dessert I had Tiramisu which was quite good but again nothing spectacular - perhaps a little dry. My wife found it terrible.  Overall, we left somewhat satisfied. We will most likely go back as the ambiance and space is relaxing and beautiful. Food is satisfying overall but I would say the main problem is that the menu is tiny. It's ok to have a small menu if the food is amazing but it's not amazing at Via Vai - however it is good - no doubt about it.  An interesting note regarding mens' wash room is that their urinal is right next to a door (opening to the outside hallway) that can not be locked because there's a stall next to the urinal. Taking a piss was quite an adventure not knowing if someone's going to open the door."}
{"text":"really enjoyed this place.  the noise level was great - barely there (early week night dinner).  loved the decor - felt like a modern art gallery.  loved the wine cabinet - reminded me of the guggenheim.  and, especially loved the food - delicious and reasonably priced.  sea bass (1 half side of a full fish) for $22 and rappini for under $10.  i'd go back for the ambience, the decor and the food again."}
{"text":"I've passed by here many times getting to/from work and have been looking forward to trying it out!   Atmosphere/space: It is absolutely gorgeous outside looking in, and I can now confirm that the interior is just as nice. We came for dinner without reservation and was seated on the long benches which was slightly awkward due to the bench length being almost as long as the table, but comfortable. Sound-wise: It wasn't too loud, and we could hear each other perfectly, which is a big plus considering acoustics in aren't always great in Toronto restaurants... other people's conversations were drowned out by the high ceilings. It was quite a bit warmer in the restaurant, perhaps due to the greenhouse effect of the large floor to ceiling windows; but it was quite airy and gorgeous inside, making it all-in-all a nice experience.   Drinks: The cocktails were only okay, with an abundance of ice, too watered down for our taste. Wouldn't order them again, but there was a massively high wine rack/library/wall/shelf so that might be a better option for future.  Pizza: We got the Marinara (prosciutto, arugula, fior di latte/mozarella?) and Funghi pizzas, which were better than expected considering the reviews on here! Marinara was a bit better in flavour. Portions were generous/comparable to other pizzas in Toronto, toppings seemed like good quality. Both were quite salty...  Service: Staff were super friendly and personable, but a bit understaffed/overworked. They topped up our water only at the beginning and after our meal was done despite the amount of salt in the meal. We didn't wait too long after our drinks to get our pizzas so the wait wasn't too bad, but as our meal progressed the restaurant had many more clients for the same number of staff. We were given the wrong bill and had to wait quite a long time to alert them, get the correct one before leaving.   Overall: Can't complain and would not mind coming back here, especially if they have some lunch deals. Price point was OK, but the food wasn't exceptional to blow you out of the water. Other than being new, and quite gorgeous inside, it wasn't particularly distinguishable to experiences at Via Mercanti on Elm or Mercatto on College just a couple minutes away, so it's just one more option in case one of them is too busy, or this one happens to be closer. Overall, a nice addition to the Bay/College/Hospital road area."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is hidden away on Bay surrounded by condos. You'd never imagine there would be a good restaurant tucked away here. This place has opened my eyes to other areas of Toronto that can offer great foods.  This place perfect for a date night, its high glass walls and intimate setting is the perfect place to take someone out on a date for drinks. They have a wide selection of cocktails and of course an extensive wine list. I'd recommend the Italiano Gardino, a gin based cocktail with cucumbers and crushed black peppers.   The staff were very kind and helpful if we ever needed anything and are quick to rectify any issues that we had. A friend of mine had ordered a pasta dish and had found a hair in her food. She told our waiter would quickly apologized and quickly got a new meal out for her. As an apology they offered her a dessert on the house.  Now, with that being said its time to turn to the big negative the food and prices. After eating here, I would have to say the prices for the food doesn't match up with the quality of the food. The value for money is the pizza. They have a good array of different pizzas for standard price, but I wouldn't say the food was spectacular. It was satisfying but  I've had better pizza in Toronto.  That pasta was the worst value for money. My friend had ordered the gnoochi to share with her date, but when the meal came it was only FOUR (Literally four because we counted)  gnoochi for the whole dish. I mean for $17 that is terrible. There is no way the restaurant could justify the prices, even if they were just made and the potatoes were imported for Ireland!  Overall, this is a great place to get a drink and go on a date 5/5. For food on the other hand, severely overpriced and for the quality of food not worth the money."}
{"text":"One Word: EMBARASSING.  A restaurant that has so much potential, but unfortunately in the wrong location. A beautiful wall mural spanning what seems to be 50 ft high with vibrant colours, and would probably attract the business investors in the financial district, sipping a glass of expensive wine, talking up a business deal.... However... I feel like this establishment is just going downhill.  Looking from the outside, the floor to ceiling glass windows will shOwcase the beautiful artwork, luring you in. You see that there are cocktail and wine deals from 4 -7, seeming attractive.... Both the reasons that I had to try this place.  I get here around 6pm.. The place is pretty much dead. We are seated and the waitor tells us that they are revamping the wine list so he is going to talk it out with us. We ask him what type of red wines there were and he starts describing them as \" leathery\" and \"jammy\".., I have no idea what the heck he is talking about nor do I have the slightest idea what type of wine it is. I tell him I'd like someone like a Malbec or a cab. He tells me I have two very different tastes yet cannot really compare it t the ones he listed earlier.  We get our wines.. They are fine. We try a second glass and I ask him to name the wine for me.. He starts to tell me about the sangiovese but stops halfway and apologizes that he cannot remember the full name... Sigh. He exclaims how bad everything is and that this is really embarrassing. No kidding,  We finally order food.. Well attempted to... I wanted to go straight to dessert and not to my surprise, the dessert option I selected is not available... Not really sure what type of establishment this is. I order the Brussels sprout salad... It is absolutely tasteless... No flavour, no acidity, just plain greens on a plate that look pretty.  The manager came by a couple times to see how things were going but not sincere at all... What was I really supposed to say... What type of restaurant are you running?  The bill is stupid expensive. Each five ounce glass came to $13 each.. So much for any wine deal, any service, anything to wow about.  I think the place should just be turned into an art gallery... Think there would be even more traffic and less expectations.  So wish I went somewhere else."}
{"text":"A group of us recently came here on a Friday night to give this place a try in hopes that our dining experience would simply be different from what the customers. After reading the number of dismaying 3 star rated reviews for Via Vai I was really debating on whether to join our dining group and had to make ample research of their menu to see if the offerings could get my curiosity going. In the end it was actually the pictures of the interior which looked like a wing of the AGO had been converted into a restaurant, that got me sold and I went for a meal here. Even walking up Bay St around 6:30pm when it is starting to get dim outside, that huge mural looming over the bar is not hard to miss. The ambiance is rather cozy and relaxing that whether you're here for an intimate (date) night out, just dining with friends or needing to unwind briefly after full day at work, you will probably feel re-energized while having just a drink or sharing some appetizers with your companions.  However, the positive experience at Via Vai seems to just halt after the overwhelming absorption this artfully swished-up ambiance. The group of us learnt this the hard way when our food came to the table. Each of our meals were brought over in a timely fashion, however, the presentation and quality of workmanship of each dish varied, which was noticeable when more than one order of the same dish was brought. The very best example of this inconsistency was the Nudja which is composed of Tomato, Rapini, Spicy Sausage and Caciacovallo. Three of us ordered this pizza and the difference in doneness between all three plates would leave people who seem them speechless with irritation, such as my pizza... So the first pizza Nudja that was brought to the table looks so well-presented and appetizing, and so did the second one that was brought over. Then the third pizza came looking so unrecognizable that I thought it was a different pizza from the menu. After a a few seconds of denial about this actually being my Nudja pizza I came to the acceptance that the top had been so over-cooked that it looked like the final stages of a solar flare on the sun. I decided not to make a complaint about it and because the pizza was thin enough that I folded each slice like a New York-style Pizza, starting with the most charred part (depicted in the pic) and just devored it as quickly as I could. And have you ever seen a pizza pie base that has been cooked to perfection ever flake up and fall onto your plate with each bite???? I have, and that's just what kept happening with my pizza.  And just when I thought I was the only one who was having this \"slight\" mishap did a few other members including the hostess for our dinner face similar issues with their pizzas. A Margarita pizza that was brought looked picture perfect on top; the tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese looked balanced in color with the basil leaves holding their raw form. But when the person tried it, he felt the dough was undercooked and had it returned. The person beside him also had her Margarita pizza brought over only find that it was just more baked than the first Margarita pizza. All around the edge of the pizza were splotches of charred spots that one would find on a naan or flat bread and the basil leaves on top were also cooked that they seemed to have shrunk from their original size.  The discord over the varying differences in which the pizzas were cooked spread through-out our table to the point where I could notice the people who had the well-made pizzas looking uncomfortable and embarrassed over the complaints made by those who had the fluke-out pizzas. I felt quite bad for the embarrassed members of the table because I also usually don't want to make a huge fuss over a dish if it doesn't look reasonably prepared. However, what occurred at our table the food was such an unnecessary mishap that could have been carefully prevented by the staff in the kitchen that it was unavoidable to hold one's disappointment in the quality of the meals.   Our server was really apologetic and tried her best to compensate by offering to ask the cooks to make something different that might positively change the appetites of the disappointed members of our table. I could really hear the sincerity in her voice when she was trying her best to lift the already settled discord among our group, and even when we made our way to the door after paying our bills she delivered the same sincere tone about the mishap over our dining experience.   The concept and formula at Via Vai makes for a very soothing fine-dining ambiance and I would not like to see that eye catching restaurant front disappear so suddenly if the reviews continue to be negative. Yes, 2.5 stars for the appealing interior design but I can't eat the walls or the wine bottle tower. Please get the quality of your dishes resolved and hopefully the current group of Yelpers will have a change of heart and give Via Vai favorable chance"}
{"text":"The place is gorgeous, with huge ceilings and glass windows and a wine rack that stretches into the ceiling. The food is pretty good too, and reasonably price. I would dock a star because the service was very slow, but I would recommend for a group celebration."}
{"text":"Via Vai seems like quite a controversial restaurant in the yelp-o-sphere. I was initially quite hesitant to visit because of their reviews, but I'm glad I gave them a try. Here's why:  The food is amazing from a culinary standpoint. There is a natural spontaneity and creativity in the way the chef has designed the recipes. Their ingredients are excellent, and they're executed beautifully. Their parchment baked sea bass was cooked absolutely perfectly on each occasion. Their octopus is slow-braised to be so tender. Their pastas are the cooked precisely and dressed with a truly perfect balance of flavors.  Given the expertise, ingredients, and effort that it takes to create the calibre that they are delivering, I strongly defend their numbers and the portions. (Yes, you might want to order a couple of dishes per person here.) There's nothing like this in the area. There's a time and place for good ol family sized pizzerias, and there's a very much a need for a concept and restaurant like Via Vai.  Having said all this, I will concede that I have experienced a lot of the frustrations others have voiced when it comes to the overall dining experience. In my eyes, I see a friendly, eager, and vibrant team that is very young. There is much ambition in the team, and that ambition can do great things with some focused direction. In any restaurant, the talent from the behind kitchen will always be tempered by the staff. There are a lot of kinks in the flow of service at the moment. Awareness, efficiency, and discipline are all a little lacking.  I do sincerely hope that the team at Via Vai finds their stride.  PS - Dear Via Vai, might want to reconsider calling yourself a \"Pizzeria.\" Your pizzas are good, but your other dishes are the stars."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner after hearing that it had opened. The environment is very nice, with a modern art gallery vibe and a ceiling so high that I wondered if it was expensive to keep the place air conditioned. The highlight by far, though, is the curving tower of wine bottles complete with a rolling ladder. The service was friendly and quick. We ordered pizzas (I got the Diavolo, which I recommend!) which were tasty with a chewy crust (in a good way). All in all a great dining experience!  The one caveat is the price. With a drink, your meal can quickly go over $30 per person, making this place less accessible on a student budget. Nevertheless, worth checking out if you're looking to spend a bit more on dinner for a cool and novel environment :P"}
{"text":"First of all, this place is GORGEOUS. The other reviewers are absolutely right in saying its a beautiful place - high ceilings, clean white space and a looming wine tower. The service is great, had absolutely no problems with the service here but the food..  The portions are tiny. Like really tiny. Especially the pasta. The pappardelle is a decent size (but definitely not for a hungry man!) but still on the smaller side. It was the tortellini that was absolutely tiny. It was around 6 pieces - barely even covering the bottom of the dish. Would definitely NOT recommend getting pasta here.  Instead, get the pizza which is a decent size for the price and is crispy thin. You can tell its very fresh and I love the charred bits from their stone oven. I liked it but didn't LOVE it enough to come back here...would choose Libretto over Via Vai any day!  We also got the charcuterie board ($25 for the salumi/fromaggi mixed board) which was really good but not enough to make me go back. The board itself had a variety of cheeses and cured meats, some apple, beets, fig slices, pickled vegetables  and purees. Heads up because the apple butter and the crostini at the top are freaking delicious!"}
{"text":"The Bad: House wine cost me $17.50 (tax in) for a GLASS!! HOW? I was so disgusted and so were the poor bartenders who were serving me. Don't go there for wine! Go to the LCBO and buy a decent bottle for the same price.   Otherwise was there for an event- food and apps were decent. Ambiance and location were good!  Best- the servers were very kind, friendly and understanding."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try out this place but was a bit discouraged to as a lot of the reviews on Yelp said the food is horrible unlike its beautiful decor. I decided to give it a shot anyway and was prepared to be disappointed.  I visited on a Friday afternoon (around 3pm) and it wasn't too packed. I got squid ink fettuccine ($13) and my friend got duck ragu pappardelle ($15). Long story short, we really enjoyed our food. The portion wasn't small at all as a lot of the reviews here said and it was delicious.  The waitresses serving us were so friendly, and the manager dropped by twice to check up on us and seemed genuinely attentive to any concerns we might have had.  The ambiance was great - very bright with glass walls and I do recommend going during the day so you can soak up the sun! Will be a great alternative to patio sitting.  Overall I had a great time and will definitely return."}
{"text":"4 thumbs up for ambiance, decor and lighting!  Great place to meet with friends and socializing.  Food is great but the service was a bit slow granted I went with 15 other gals for a birthday celebration. And the place was packed! Nice staff and friendly bartenders. We all tried a bit of everything and we all shared.  Appis were good. I highly recommend their pizzas!!! And oh my, the wine list is awesome!!! I'd go back again..."}
{"text":"Poor quality restaurant. Came with a group. They subbed the arugula on one pizza for mixed greens, and the basil on a margarita pizza consisted of 2 small leaves, and again, some chopped lettuce as a substitute. Also, wasn't informed they were out of anchovies, until after the anchovy pizza was made. The dough was so soggy it needed to be eaten with a fork and knife. All ingredients on every pizza we ordered, be it pineapples, prosciutto, sausage - anything that would have cost the restaurant money, was skimped out on. And finally, nothing came out in sync, so a couple of people were left waiting until everyone was done, and then when their pizza did finally arrive, the bottom was black, burnt, and tasted foul. Just a legitimately unpleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"3.5/5.  *The restaurant is gorgeous and perfect for a date night.  *Some of the dishes really needed some final touches to make them perfect. *A bit expensive for the portion that we received.  *Our server was friendly however she was pretty much overworked. The host was there just to look pretty and didn't bother to even check for our desserts when we asked (it arrived 45 minutes late!!!).   -Pappardelle Pasta (Lamb ragu, sweet peas, tomatoes, mint) - $16:  The pappardelle was slightly under-cooked for both of us and I wished there was more sauce as the lamb ragu was just perfect!! Very hearty with melted-in-your-mouth lamb pieces and seasoned perfectly, my favorite!  -Bavette (?) nero scoglio (Scallop, squid, clams, mussels) - $26:  On the menu this dish was actually made with fettucine pasta, however it was sold out that day so the server offered me a different type of pasta.   For $26 the portion was quite small, however the pasta was al dente and you can tell Via Vai make their own pasta in house! There were a decent amount of seafood for $26 and they were cooked perfectly. However the tomato sauce was lacking in flavor and the whole dish was bland, so it was quite disappointing as I was really looking forward to this dish :(.  -Honey Panna Cotta - $7:  It was pretty good. The panna cotta had the right texture and the tangy fruits helped to cut down the sweetness from the honey.  -Tiramisu - $7: I didn't like the biscotti as it was dry and tough to eat. The tiramisu had a strong espresso and chocolate flavor and the taste was just pure heaven. Surprisingly the base of the tiramisu was a sponge cake instead of lady fingers, which I didn't mind as I found the tiramisu still held up really well. I also liked how there wasn't too much mascarpone so the dessert wasn't too rich nor sweet, and I didn't think the raspberry sauce was needed"}
{"text":"The brunch is horrible. The Eggs Benedict was dreadful. Firstly its served in a bowl, so everything is sitting in the water that the eggs were poached in. Mmmmm....tepid egg water, just gross. The potatoes were cold, eggs were cold. It was a brown bland dish. There was only one other table dining for brunch so not sure why the food was cold. Considering how empty it was, the service wasn't great either. Won't return for brunch.  Unfortunate really because the look of this place is just great."}
{"text":"For a new restaurant, this place is on point.  My friend and I disregarded the weak reviews and gave Via Vai a try tonight since we both live so close.  Honestly, it's fantastic.  Obviously the restaurant is beautiful and loaded with gorgeous art, but we were truly impressed with the food.  Having both recently been to Italy, I actually don't like going out for Italian food because I find that I am often disappointed.  We both started with the Insalata Via Vai and it was delicious.  It was perfectly peppery arugula and I think a type of radicchio, with chunks of grapefruit and candied nuts, a generous portion of asiago and balsamic vinaigrette.  It was also a nice sized salad and definitely worth the price point of under $10!  Then my friend had the paccheri pasta, which had chili and was in a beautifully seasoned tomato sauce.  I went for the squid ink fettuccine with lots of squid and olive oil.  We actually were chatting with the manager, Jordan, who came to check on us, and I asked if I should get the margherita pizza or the fettuccine, and when he told me to get the fettuccine, I was skeptical.  I told him that I really only ever order pasta if it's outstanding, since my boyfriend makes his own fresh pasta at home.  Jordan assured me that their pasta was fresh and that he was confident I would love it.  He was right.  The squid was cooked perfectly and the portion was great (about 7-8 sizeable pieces of squid I think with one full mini octopus in there too).  The pasta was a deep purple colour and was drizzled with just the right amount of quality olive oil.  I asked for some chili flakes and added a bit of heat and it was honestly so so good that I had to write a review.  The only thing I would recommend is that if you're hungry, you definitely need to order an app and a pasta or pizza to be full.  We ended up trying the margherita pizza in the end as well (and obviously took some home cause we were stuffed), and it was fantastic.  I work in the financial district and am at the new Libretto down there regularly, and while I would say that Libretto has the Toronto market pretty much cornered on killer pizza, Via Vai's pizza is very, very good.  The crust was perfectly chewy, the sauce had just a hint of sweetness, and they used just the right amount of cheese and basil.  I think at $12 too it will definitely become my go-to spot for takeout pizza in the neighbourhood since North of Brooklyn's pies are so huge and therefore much more expensive.  The negative reviews are super unwarranted.  Definitely go check this place out cause whatever kinks they may have initially had when they opened are now non-existent.  This is a great date spot, and I will definitely bring my boyfriend next time!"}
{"text":"Wondeful dining experience, which I am not used to...since I have food allergies, including Celiac.  I am used to getting limited choice in meals and flavours,  with a side of attitude when I ask about ingredients.  Not here at all!  Both food and service were amazing!  I mentioned the food allergies to the manager, who was super helpful and pointed out a few things we could eat off the menu The manager even went to let the chef know, and as it wasn't too busy on a Monday night, the chef actually came out and asked about our allergies.  Then, he  prepared some dishes tha he said would be on the new menu.   Really, I  can't describe the food in a way that does it justice...there was a chopped Brussel sprout salad, a gluten free pasta with some mushroom sauce, and the most tender roasted tomato meatballs.   Really the best I've ever had.  My friends also enjoyed their Marguerita pizza, but I also had to fight them for some of my food once they tried it!   The  passion for not only preparing a special meal, but actually being hospitable to guests was really evident.  For once, instead of feeling like a pain, I felt welcome and could actually enjoy the meal, and the company, instead of worrying about ingredients.   Thank you so much everyone at Via Vai for making our night and inspiring a great evenging!   Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for Via Vai. I work across the street from Via Vai and when I heard that they were offering a $15 lunch menu, my first thought was, \"yeh! I don't have to make the trek to Pizzeria Libretto.\" Sure, I did not expect the pizza to be nearly as good as PL, but I was hopeful. When I asked my colleagues to check it out with me, they all told me - I am not exaggerating - all 6 that I had asked - told me that they had heard horrible things about this restaurant. So rather than listen to them, I figured that a new establishment should be given the opportunity to iron out their kinks.   This week I met a friend here for lunch, and the first thing we noticed when we sat down was how cold it was. Approximately 5 minutes later our waitress came by (btw, we were the only people in the restaurant at 11:30am). My friend does not drink coffee, so she asked for tea. She was told that they did not have any tea. So my friend asked for something else - can't remember what it was - and the waitress said, we only have what is in our menu. Hmmm.....tea IS on your menu! Any other service-oriented establishment would have gotten someone to run over to Sobey's located a block away to pick up some tea!  In the end I ordered a cappuccino and my friend ordered a decaf coffee. I then asked about the $15 lunch special and she looked at me like I had three heads. I then explained to her what the $15 lunch special was, and she admitted to not knowing what I was talking about. So I suggested that she ask her manager. She came back a few minutes later and told us that this special was only for when they first opened. Hmmm, odd, I have the menu and nowhere in the menu does it have an expiry date (I am attaching the menu). My friend did not want to make a fuss, so we ordered a pizza.   20 minutes later our pizza came out but still no sign of our coffees. We inquired about our coffee and we were told that they were fixing the machine - the bartender was not there and he was the only one that knew how to use the espresso machine. And you call yourself an Italian restaurant???!!! WOW! Every person on your payroll should know how to make espressos in their sleep! Then we wondered why they did not tell us about the delay 15 minutes before while we sat there wondering what the hell was going on! Almost 45 minutes after we made our drink order, our coffees came out, and my coffee tasted rancid. Worst coffee I have ever had. Something must have gone terribly wrong when they were learning how to use the machine.   So, as much as I hate admitting it; my colleagues were 100% right. I should have stuck to PL. If the service had been good, all the hiccups would have dramatically changed our experience. Though the pizza was tasty, when you put everything that happened together, this was a disastrous experience. So take it from me and my colleagues, you are better off making the trek to Pizzeria Libretto, or even give Tosto a try (keep in mind that Tosto gets insanely loud).   Two stars were given only because the pizza was decent."}
{"text":"Another pretender restaurant in the big smoke. What do I mean? Beautiful decor and attention to the artistic detail but fail on food.  I have been to too many good pizzerias in Europe and across North America to eat under cooked doughy pizza. Time to fire the pizza chef! Wait, wait, wait...Rewind!  Let's start from the beginning.  I walked in about an hour early ahead of my dinner group. I was greeted by a very nice bartender who took my order for a glass of Chianti. I realized something was 'off' on the taste, I have been to too many wineries and lessons to not notice. I did not think about it any further...I simply thought why bother? I just won't have it again. After all it is a wine bar there will be other wines.  After all it is what they do best, right?  When my group arrived I settled my bill at the bar thinking I had ordered the 3 ounce, but the bartender served me a 5 ounce. No big deal. I paid the $10 and gave her a nice $2 tip for her trouble. Of course somebody should change the price in the computer because the amount was $11 on the menu. Lax processes on the management side.  I joined my friends at their table and we ordered for ourselves and were dismayed that they would sit a table of 10 in the corner next to the giant wine shelf. Poor planning because when this was decided there was ample space available where the whole bench would not have to get up should someone needed to get in or out.  As we began to order the waitress did not know her product as she had to go back to the kitchen for her answer to which type of pasta came with one of the FOUR pasta dishes.  When another friend ordered wine they did not have two of her choices in stock.  This is supposed to be a wine bar right?   Now to the one food items.  When your specialty is pizza and you have invested in a brick oven and a beautiful restaurant location, your pizza better be good...I really wanted this to be good.  When my Margarita pizza arrived I was happy to see it was not overcooked like the others at the table.    Unfortunately, it was all too evident that my pizza was undercooked as the dough itself was not cooked through. The dough was chewy and doughy with a wet dough consistency.  I immediately asked for the waitress and returned the pizza.  Three other pizzas at the table were also inedible.  One was overcooked and burnt but the dough as well was undercooked.  The manager came by to apologize and asked the pizza chef to make her a pizza to test. She also took the affected items off the bill.  That is good management.  However, better management would be to rectify the issues before they sink the restaurant.    How is it that a pizzeria and wine bar serves inedible pizza and has questionable wine management issues like lack of stock and freshness issues. I hope for their sake it was just a Gremlin day; a fluke.  Probably not.  After six months open the kinks better be worked out.  Time to take steps toward a higher level or sink fast.  As for myself and the dining club, we will not be returning.  Overall rating: 1/5 Food: 1/5 Wine: 1/5 Service: 3/5 (as a courtesy to the hapless staff - they did try)"}
{"text":"Review based on their summerlicious.  Went with a pretty big group for dinner. On the cheaper side of summerlicious choices so didn't expect too much. How I think of summerlicious is for places to show case what they can offer so I will come or not come back. From what we got, I think consensus was don't ever come back.  Environment: Looked very nice and not many other tables there (1 other for the night) so it was like a place to ourselves. However it was super hot especially when the sun was still out. Don't think they had AC, we were sweating...  Service: Like some others have mentioned, really mediocre service. Only had 2 tables and they couldn't remember who ordered what. The plating was average to non existent. No one filled our glasses and we had to do it ourselves the first hour or two. Some sauce was spilled on someone's purse.  Food: Appetizer: Bison tartar wasn't too bad and plated decently but was chewy.                   Eggplant Parmesan portions had wide wide range but taste was pretty good.  Mains: Margaritta Pizza - Literally had 3 basil leaves for 6 slices... (Made me miss Levetto)             Veal something - Felt bad for the calves as how badly it was prepped. Pretty salty, hard and chewy. Some people actually said they got physically tired cutting it.  Dessert: Could only comment on the tiramisu, taste was there. Portion was of decent size I think so maybe they improved. But plating was just thrown on to a plate.  Wasn't too pricey, didn't expect much but still was disappointed. Left hungry."}
{"text":"Living nearby, this place seemed like a good place to check out. The space is definitely well designed; brightly lit and inviting, with a cool ladder for their shelves of wines. I ordered the pizza with anchovies, which was pretty delicious and unique, considered most gourmet pizza places don't have anchovies anymore. The crust is not as crisp as Tostos down the street, but that is not a bad thing. The pasta portions are kind of small."}
{"text":"I want to give this place at least a three star rating, but our waiter was just plain terrible. The rest of the staff that popped up here and there plus the hostess was fabulous. Our waiter in particular was not the best; cold and unapologetic when he didn't inform us that there's a typo on their menu. My husband ordered the Nduja pizza and on the menu it says \"tomato,\" but we only realized after the fact that the pizza came and there was no sauce (my husband thought he misread which is why we didn't send it back). Our realization came too late, so we mentioned it to our waiter and yet his reply was not apologetic, but that he forgot about it and because \"everyone\" knows about it, therefore he forgot. They're new, who's everyone other than the staff! We told another waiter when paying our bill and he apologized and offered a free espresso, but it was really too little too late. That said, the pizza itself was fairly bland.   The squid ink pasta on the other hand was quite good, and the pasta seemed freshly made.   Overall if we're looking for a pizza, we'd rather go to Libretto with better pizza and service."}
