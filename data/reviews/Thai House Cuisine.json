{"text":"Food is great SERVICE IS TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
been here several times, first time they had a waitress that was friendly nowadays only a male waiter that is so dumb like a donkey.
the food is really yummy so we decided to have them for takeaway at least we dont have 2 give tip for this awful attitude!!!
It was a joke when we went there at 6pm and we were the ONLY customer but their silly waiter told me to fold my child's stroller!!! I told him ''as you see you don't have any customer at all and I 'll fold it when it's busy in here or other option is that I leave and eat somewhere else! \" 
What a moron!!!  Eventually we told them we would just have it as take away... and what a relief it was to not pay tip :)))
that guy has a frown on his face and he thinks he is still in China, I am not interested in their communist customer service so I think I came to the point that we won't step feet there again no matter how good the food is"}
{"text":"Finally!!!! I have been searching and searching for a good Thai restaurant for the past few years! Thai house truly amazed me! The food was very flavorful, and fresh. The service was great as well. 2 thumbs up!!! I will surely return for more."}
{"text":"Love this place! 
Delicious food every time. Beautiful polite servers and a chef who actually takes the time to come out and see how you like the food. Our young family eats here all the time."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food in the neighbourhood, eat in or take away.  If the dishes were a tad spicier, I would give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this restaurant's ratings are so high. I eat thai food ALL.THE.TIME. And I can tell you the one meal I ate here was so brutal, I'll never return.
I ordered their Tom Yum Soup with Chicken. It was awful. It didn't taste like your typical Tom Yum, spicy with cilantro, lemongrass and a tart broth. It was thick and flavourless, jammed with mushrooms and not much else.
Their takeout service was extremely slow, it took almost 40 minutes for 2 soups. The portion size of the soup was incredibly small for the high price and they charged me for noodles which they didn't include. 
That doesn't even begin to describe the disgusting atmosphere of this restaurant. It's falling apart. The ceiling looks like it'll collapse any second. It's dark, dingy, dusty and dirty. 
There's another thai restaurant located close to this one - the food is so-so, but at least the atmosphere is clean, tidy and stylish. 
Don't eat here!"}
{"text":"I have no idea why the Thai House gets such high reviews!!!!  I ordered delivery based on the reviews here and can't disagree more.  We ordered spring rolls, green papaya salad, green curry, chicken with cashew nuts, and mango with sticky rice.  I have been to SE Asia, so I must disagree with the other reviewer who compares food found there.  The Green curry and papaya salad was not flavourful AT ALL, the cashew chicken was way too saucy and tasted . . . off.  Very disappointed and will not order again.  I can say that ordering online was convenient and they were very nice and polite.  The delivery drive was also very nice.  But I think it must have been busy as our food arrived cold.  Perhaps different if you eat in."}
{"text":"Nice kid friendly restaurant.  Doesn't look as appealing from the outside, but nice ambiance inside.  Mango salad very good!  Kids enjoyed the spring rolls.  Pad Thai chicken was decent.  Grilled beef was a bit chewy.  Wok cashew beef was very nice.  Bill was decently priced for four."}
{"text":"I honestly think that Thai House Cuisine is among the best Thai food in the city.  Even after moving away from the Beaches and far into the West end, I've often gone out of my way to return to the East for Thai House Cuisine.

They do great Cashew Nut Chicken, and their curry chicken and Pad Thai are also great.  Love their vegetable rice, and the vegetarian spring rolls.  I've always felt that the food here is fresh and of great quality, especially compared to other thai restaurants in the city.

The restaurant itself is clean, comfortable, and welcoming.  But you can also do take-out and they also deliver!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Thai House.  Having spent over a month in SE Asia last year I have shifted my expectations up a notch for Thai cuisine.  The flavour here and the ingredients were authentic.  The green curry was great with plenty of lemongrass mixed in.  It had also the right blend of spice - hot but not overpowering the flavours.  $7.50 for lunch incl. soup, roll and main...... umm $7.50!? come on you can't even get bacon and eggs in the Beach for that price!  Opens at 1230 so sleep in, don't worry about line ups and enjoy a great Thai meal."}
{"text":"The curry dish was tasty, as were the spring rolls. However, we order 2 dishes and 2 apps.. The price seemed expensive given the size of the containers that came. The price point seemed steep $46 plus tip to the driver.... probably will try someplace else next time."}
{"text":"The place was pleasant and the lunch specials were decently priced with a lot of selection to choose from.  Along with your lunch you get a spring roll and a choice of mango salad or soup of the day.  The restaurant was suitable for my 2yr old with a high chair and toddler friendly utensils and plates (from ikea).  My wife had the pad Thai and I had the tom yum noodle soup with chicken. It wasn't too bad but definitely had better. Overall this was a decent place and I give it a solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"I've been here an awful lot of times and some of those times the meals have been amazing. Other times they've merely been OK. And yet other times I've had to rethink my meal choice because they're simply out of ingredients.

I keep returning because the food is reliably OK and, about 75% of the time, amazing. Their noodle dishes are the biggest source of quality variability; sometimes the noodles are clearly overcooked (and thus challenging to separate from one another and eat because they're glued together) whereas in other cases they're done properly. The same with spicing: sometimes the 'hot' is super mild whereas in other instances it's appreciably warm in the back of your throat.

The staff are always friendly and accommodating, and have given me discounts when the cooks have been unable to fulfil an order. The servers are all quick with refills and provide helpful guidance to diners who are unsure of different items on the menu. 

In terms of ambiance, the restaurant is tastefully decorated. It also tends to be pretty quiet in the evening and so a nice place to go with a friend or loved one for a quiet meal.

All in all, Thai House Cuisine is worth visiting if you're looking for a regularly decent meal and are in the area. That said, don't come to the Beaches just to visit this particular location."}
{"text":"Great food .Real thai flavor !
Whatever you order, you can't go wrong.
They are doing very good job on food!

Their tom yum soup is really deep and flavourful.
Also I like their basil squid as well.

Good service!"}
{"text":"Solid, reliable, consistent Thai food.  Presentation is standard.  Lunch specials include spring roll and soup and are under $10 each."}
{"text":"Yuck. I wanted to like Thai House Cuisine but their spicy noodles (pad kee mao) were big time yuck. It may be that I misread the menu but the noodles weren't fried after they were boiled, jist doused with sauce which resulted in a slimy bowl full of wet sticky rice noodles. Hard pass for me."}
{"text":"Sweetest service, genuinely Thai. I always have the basil duck with an extra helping of prik nam pla. They always get it right. The massaman is a lamb lover's treat and the pad thai is a beautiful dish full of existential sweet sour conflict."}
{"text":"Arrived at the Thai House on Saturday evening, thinking it would be quite busy but we were luckily, able to get a table right by the window.

Server brought us waters and menus immediately. We ordered the green curry chicken ($11.99), pad thai ($10.99), and the basil beef ($11.99).  Food came very quickly, probably within 15 minutes. Flavours were all pretty standard but we found the servings to be smaller than usual.

As we were leaving, the restaurant became very busy and it took quite some time to get our bill and left overs wrapped up (understandable).

I'm sure we would return, but there are a few other thai places that are worth a try in this area."}
{"text":"The green curry with chicken is not that different from a bowl of oatmeal with milk and sugar. The basic palatable flavors are there - salty, sweet, mushy, and it is edible but beyond this, it's pretty much like eating paste. Not something you'd leave your house in the evening to go out and pay money for when you've already eaten essentially the same thing for breakfast on a Monday morning before rush hour to give you a high enough sugarcarb hit to make it to the office on time. Thai food? ...um nope."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, a great menu, and skilled preparation - I've never had better Thai.  

Particular favourites: spicy basil beef, ginger chicken, spring rolls, sticky rice with peanut sauce, mango salad, and their amazing pad thai!  Thai beers are reasonably priced and cold, and service is pleasant.  

In the summer they open early for lunch, and the combos are a great deal."}
{"text":"Okay, so to be fair, I defy anyone to name a restaurant in the east end that is worth traveling to the east end for from any location other than the east end!

That said, this is probably the best Thai restaurant in the east end, at least as far as I have found so far.  Compared to a number of other Thai restaurants in the city, this is no a 5 start place. 

The dishes are tasty and reliable though and well priced.  Two people can eat there for about $35 or so which is pretty hard to find these days unless you're eating crap.  The spring rolls are okay, the glass noodle is pretty good, but they put some kind of dark mushroom in it which I don't really think enhances the flavor and the load lots of dishes up with way to many peppers.  

Panang chicken curry, which is one of my favorite Thai dishes is awesome, and the restaurant itself is very pleasant and well designed.  Watch out for the Thai spicy chicken, it's a house specialty and it's really good, but it will make your scalp sweat it's so spicy."}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot; it's an authentic Thai place (the waiter, chefs and host were all Thai) so the food was quite legitimate! The place had a cozy family feel; it was nice and quiet inside, great for conversation or date night. Prices were agreeable and portions to quality was impressive. It was cheaper than the Thai food I've had in Financial District but just as good. Definitely recommend it if you're in the beaches area!"}
{"text":"i LOVE thai house cuisine! very accommodating towards vegans!! come here all the time"}
{"text":"This is my favourite thai restaurant in the beach.  Everything tastes fresh and authentic (although I haven't actually been to Thailand to test the validity of their authentic-ness) . The green curry had kafir leaves in the sauce, most thai restaurants don't have that."}
{"text":"I recently had that horrible cold that was going around this winter.  It would NOT END! Even for my birthday. The only saving grace was that I had the Green Chicken Curry and it was amazing and made up for the fact that I was sooooooo sick."}
{"text":"I order two dishes, one was yellow noodle vegetarian which was bland and mostly noodles with a few veggies thrown in and one was asparagus and shiitake mushrooms in oyster sauce which was disgusting, it was like they took all the woody ends from the asparagus, I would not be exaggerating when I say there was not one tip in the entire dish, I ended up throwing most of it away completely a waste of money.
I used to order from here all the time but like most places they obviously don't think they have to make an effort to keep customers, I will be going elsewhere next time I have a craving for Thai!!"}
{"text":"Good Thai food, prices are reasonable. Wish they gave free prawn crackers like some of the other restaurants. Really liked their curry pad Thai and they have good sauces. 

Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"great local thai place.  The seasonal mango sticky rice desert is literally to die for!"}
{"text":"I had take out and ordered the Cashew nut chicken with a bowl of steamed rice and 3 vegy spring rolls with dipping sauce.

OHHH MY, this was absolutely the best tasting food.
They had quarter slices of fruit, the spice was less then I like but next time I'll ask them to spice it up for me.
the whole bowl was just so well done and rice was perfect.

These Thai places I go to are incredible or the food is just incredible.

Came here to dine in one time with my girlfriend and the service was amazing, the sever was dressed in a Thai gown like you would think your in Thai land.
She always made sure our water was topped up and gave us a free desert not knowing we were going to order a dessert. :)

But I highly recommend this place, the seating is great and it's VERY clean and just looks so nice in there."}
{"text":"I want to give it more stars because for $10 lunch you get a daily soup and spring roll, a main and ice cream which is awesome any where in this city
I got the basil noodles and they were in a goupy soup instead of pan fried as I'd expected 
The ice cream was orange creamsicle flavour which didn't seem very Thai? I'd thought Mango or green tea or something. But hey it's free so whatever 
Next time I'd get one of the curries and then I'll update my review 
Good service this lady is the one working the entire room a pretty busy lunch crowd 
Lots of water refills and friendly
I will come back I just don't expect super amazing for a deal
Pattaya down the road is amazing and friendly Thai in Leslieville is terrible so this is a happy medium on a budget"}
{"text":"I had the vegetarian eggplant dish which was excellent. Service was friendly, location is nice and quiet. They were out of the fried bananas, but restaurants running out of things is usually a good sign."}
