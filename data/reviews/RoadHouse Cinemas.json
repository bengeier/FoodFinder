{"text":"What a gem! Went here for a date night and we absolutely loved it. Seating and viewing is top-notch. Wonderful staff and service. Loved the very large 'one size' popcorn bowl. No waste on paper cups and bowls like all the other theatres. Will be going here for all our movie going experiences."}
{"text":"I have been to the Road home 3 times now and will for sure continue to go Clean friendly cost effective. 6 dollar Tuesday are great. The food I have had has been great. Though my friends haven't been quite as lucky. One thing I haven't seen while there is manager or supervisor you see them all around HarkinsTheatres. But this staff has been helpful and respectful . Thank you for upgrading that old Theater and making it a welcoming place to enjoy."}
{"text":"The food is ok the seats are great. The stuff they run before the movies is awful. The production quality is horrible. The interviews for these movie are horrible. The guy pitching the popcorn should consider never doing a promo again.   Do yourself a favor if it says 11 start time show up at 11:15"}
{"text":"Best place to watch a movie! Reclining seats are excellent and especially love that they are loveseats with fold up armrests for when on a date. Love that they have a nice selection of local craft beers and bonus for the happy hour pricing. Can't believe all that you get for standard movie ticket prices. Props to the friendly and efficient staff. Will be visiting much more frequently now that I've discovered this jewel!"}
{"text":"This is, hands down, the best movie theatre I've ever been to. I almost didnt write this review because i dont want it getting too popular and all of the annoying people ruining it :P. There are so many aspects of this theatre that are amazing, I will surely forget something, so I'm just going to bullet point them.    *Very comfortable seating (electronic recliners)  *Great theatre and elevations (the wall heights make each row feel like you are the only ones in the theatre)  *Phenomenal food and drinks with a happy hour (great pricing especially when compared to other theatres like ipic). The adult root beer float is great.  *Awesome prices. I couldn't believe the ticket prices especially after walking in this place for the first time. (Seriously compare the ticket prices to other luxury theatres).  ***The staff at this place... wow... The owner should be proud. Every single staff member we walked by told us to enjoy our movie and ALL of them bid us a good night upon leaving.  Our servers were extremely friendly while also being professional and prompt.   Do yourself a favor and give this theatre a try. You are going to love it."}
{"text":"I love Roadhouse for  the experience they provide along with excellent food and comfortable seats.  Prices are reasonable and popcorn is the best in town."}
{"text":"I love this place! Free refills on the popcorn and soft drinks, and even a bag to take home more popcorn. I even purchased the Free 2017 Popcorn t-shirt. After 3 visits, it pays for it's self, and I've seen several movies already this year. I've been going here since it opened. The food is good. I really liked the bison/lamb? burger that they had for a limited time special. I usually go on Tuesday's. You can't beat the price of $6+tax tickets, good all day long. The staff is awesome, always very friendly, and they do their best to make sure you're enjoying your time there. I already have my ticket for tomorrow to see Wonder Woman, and I can't wait for the pre-purchase tickets go on sale for Star Wars, EP8!!!"}
{"text":"Imagine sitting down on your couch at home in front of your TV set to watch a movie. Now imagine a group of waiters and waitresses walking back and forth in front of you all through the movie to serve food to a large group of people. Back and forth. Forth and back. If your lucking to get seats in row 2, that's your destiny. Movie? What Movie? Awful experience! If you have any interest in actually seeing the show, I'd find an alternative cinema elsewhere that really cares about the \"movie experience\"."}
{"text":"The theater is very clean and new, has only been open three weeks.  Seats were very comfortable and the layout was quite nice.  Great menu selections. Tried the roadhouse munchies which was ok. It comes with a ton of fries, so when you order the main course don't bother ordering fries for an extra $4.  We were told that it was happy hour ( it wasn't, they don't do it on weekends) Food was ok. Server messed it up twice somehow, and there was a really long hair in my wrap. Don't like the concept of writing down on a piece of paper what you want. What is wrong with just telling the server??? Maybe we will be back in 6 months when they have worked out the kinks, but probably not. Will stick with SMG or AMC, or ipic. Overall this just was not a good experience."}
{"text":"Love this place!! It's clean and nice and the chairs are AWESOME!!! One of the nicest theaters I have been to and that includes Newport Beach. The gelato needs serious work but I still loved the place."}
{"text":"Loved it. Seriously half the price of Ipic and way cooler. I almost don't want to write a good review, because this place is going to get popular fast, and then we won't get our pick of seats! HUbs said the popcorn was the best he ever had. And its not regular movie popcorn. We didn't eat food, as we had already had dinner. But the drinks and popcorn are free refills... So its a bit pricier than a Harkins. We cannot wait bring the kids and try out a Tuesday $6 movie!! Or a happy hour!! Only thing that would have made this over the top luxury is if they would have included blankets like the Ipic. Otherwise, great job!!"}
{"text":"We uses a group-on for the venue. The movie and the movie experience was fine. However, the theater was a mess. We visited on a Monday evening which is one of their slowest evenings. The bathrooms were a mess, counters dirty and wet with trash cans overflowing (slow night). The bartender was fun and good natured. However the bar was messy. There floors in the front area had trash and popcorn all over. There was staff standing and not cleaning. \"If you have time to lean, you have time to clean'\" staff would walk by trash on the floor and not pickup.   The food was mediocre. Most of the food items were commercerly purchased and reheated. The pizza was mostly a mediocre pie crust with few toppings. The beer and drinks were cold and tasty.  I would pay more and go to a similar venue in Town."}
{"text":"Home away from home. Chairs are super comfy. Service is wonderful and HAPPY HOUR! Yippee"}
{"text":"The roadhouse is new, comfortable and reasonably priced. Easy access, great menu, friendly service."}
{"text":"Ok...so we were visiting our daughter, who lives in Phoenix , from the east coast. We wanted to catch a movie and thought this would be a nice treat. I will split this into two reviews...movie experience and food experience.  First the good..I would love to have this type of theater near us at home. Great seats,good sound,fantastic popcorn and the concept of getting food delivered to your seat is amazing. Now the bad..the food definitely does not live up to the standards it should at the prices charged. Our daughter ordered a pizza..just nasty. .my wife and I got salads..very basic and the chicken was almost nonexistent.  Also the food was delivered almost 45 mins after ordered. The movie was half over. If they upgrade the food it would definitely make it worth while. Maybe stick to drinks,popcorn and a movie in a comfortable environment."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!  We took advantage of the groupon which included 2 movie tickets, two beers, and a unlimited refill of their popcorn. Great deal when we looked into it. Basically all we paid for were the movie tickets themselves.  When we got there we were actually really hungry so we ended up getting some of their food items as well. Usually at these dine in theater options the food is pretty much over priced glorified concession food. Not here, their food is actually good! My boyfriend got a burger and it was quite tasty. I had the chicken tenders, they were dry but there was actual chicken in them and a good chicken to breading ratio-i'd eat them again.  For their popcorn they have a few different options and they even let you do half and half! The popcorn comes to you in a giant metal bowl. The staff was great. All very very very kind and friendly, probably the best service i've ever had at any theater of any kind and better than some restaurants.  Everything was also really clean and tidy, very well taken care of and well maintained. Overall GREAT experience and we will absolutely be back even without a groupon."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and a movie. Left very impressed! The place is beautiful and full of character, the seats are very comfortable, and we had excellent service. Everything was a great value. And I LOVED the popcorn, especially the fact that it comes in a bowl (not a bag like most theaters) and can be delivered right to your seat. I highly recommend Roadhouse Cinemas!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! My husband and I had a wonderful time! We got our tickets off a Groupon deal...two tickets and popcorn for $15. What a great deal! We then reserved our seats online which was cool that we could reserve where we wanted to sit before we got there. They recommend that you get there 30min early to look over the food menu so we did. We walked into the front door and saw they have a restaurant to the right and ticket desk and concession is off to the left. We went to the ticket desk and they scanned my phone that had our purchase code and we were off to find our seats. Easiest transaction ever. Once we got to our seats and settled in we pushed the call button for our waitress. She scanned one of our tickets to claim our Groupon popcorn. You could choose from 3 different kinds. We got regular popcorn with butter. It was not your run of the mill theater popcorn. It was some of the best popcorn we have ever had! The seats are super comfy and they have a full menu of yummy food. Our waitress was excellent and super nice. I have a gluten and soy allergy and she took it very seriously which I always appreciate. She even called the head  chef that wasn't there at the time to confirm if their homemade GF pizza crust had soy flour in it...it doesn't FYI. We got the GF pesto pizza and it was excellent! One of the best GF pizzas we have had. We also sampled their gelato which was sooo yummy! Over all the funniest movie night ever! Unfortunately this experience has spoiled us and any normal theater will just fail in comparison."}
{"text":"Went here twice while in Scottsdale. Every visit hit it out of the park!  Seats are super comfy.  The food was tasty and fast.  Go during the week for matinee tickets and from 3-6 half price munchies and drinks."}
{"text":"We checked this out for the first time yesterday and can confidently say we will be back!  The seats are fantastic - large leather recliners like iPic but a fraction of the price.  Adult ticket was $10.  In-seat service with a call button so you don't have to flag down a server when they walk by.  We had the goat cheese appetizer and wine and both were good.  Didn't try other food but seemed everyone around us was enjoying their gourmet popcorn.  Only area that could be improved was speed of service (both at outside bar and in seat), however it was a holiday and maybe they weren't fully staffed.  Either way, will definitely return.  Our new go-to theater!"}
{"text":"Have been to several movies there and it is a great experience.  Lush comfortable seating with in theater food service.  Tuesday has a great senior discount and Wednesday has an incredible discount before 4pm.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"We love this place! The concept is fantastic. We usually god early and sit at the bar and order an entree or app to share and a beer. The pizza is good and the burgers are delicious- although they are a little small to share. They did however split it for us on two plates. I love that the popcorn has different flavors. Last time we were in I was informed you can mix flavors- we tried jalapeño and white cheddar! Yum! We also love the roadhouse pretzel with cheese! Overall awesome movie theater with great prices and comfy seats!"}
{"text":"First time here, and Wow - they really elevated this style of business from the other players in the valley.  Prices were very good, Staff was extremely reasonable and polite (I had to change my pre-purchased tickets to a later time), food was good, seats were super comfortable.  Whole experience was top notch.  Lots of little details that just seem \"well thought out\" - example.... we had an aisle seat - there is a small wall that blocks people going up and down the aisle from your peripheral vision....  Staff during the movie was super attentive on refills of soda and popcorn.  And the popcorn - so good.  And they say its the best, which, everyone says about their own popcorn, but, the flavor was awesome and it wasn't greasy or oily at all.  It was really good.  The whole family asked when we were coming back, so, I'd say thats a hands down win for RoadHouse."}
{"text":"Very beautiful cinema with a relaxing environment. When you first walk in there's a restaurant for their full menu, drinks at the bar, four flavors of popcorn (regular, white cheddar, caramel, jalepeno), desserts, or gelato. Inside the theatre the menu service has always been smooth and not interrupted the movie. The car show in the parking lot on weekends is a bonus. Be sure to bring a jacket because it's pretty cold inside."}
{"text":"It was a good theater similar to ipic but the food is better than any movie theater I've been in . I advise u to go there"}
{"text":"Loved this theatre experience!  My friend and I visited the newly renovated theatre last week and absolutely loved it.  The staff were super friendly.  We didn't stop to enjoy the full restaurant lounge that has been added because we opted to enjoy our dinner at our seats.  You can buy and reserve your seats online.  The theatre seats are big and super comfy and recline. The new swinging trays make enjoying your dinner and drinks easy.  We enjoyed ice cold beer (they have a nice selection of craft beer) and split a sandwich so that we would have room for popcorn. They serve popcorn in a bowl instead of a bag so you have the feeling that you are at home watching a movie.   All food and beverage service is done right at your seat. No need to juggle your drinks and food while trying to find your seat in the dark. I can't wait to go to a movie at this location again!"}
{"text":"This theatre will change your life.  We live in the east valley and drive all the way here just to see a movie.  The food is excellent and the service is amazing.  Not to mention the most comfortable reclining seats ever!  Also, if you order popcorn they fill up a huge back to take home!"}
{"text":"My new favorite movie place! Got a great promotion in the mail for BOGO entree. Hung out and ate before our movie. Had the short rib tacos. Delish! Quick and friendly service.  Saw some other food coming out looked awesome. My only disappointment was the lack of knowledge from the bartender. Very sweet guy, good host. Love it!!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Roadhouse cinemas.  They say they want their customers to leave asking \"why would you see a movie anywhere else?\" And that is a question I haven't found an answer to yet.  They have a fantastic selection of local beers, wine, etc.  The food on their menu tastes good, and in my opinion is very fairly priced, especially considering you are in a theater.  A burger and fries will be about $12.  $2.50 for a soda with free refills is less than half the price of other theaters.  The only item I think is too expensive is their popcorn, but it is unlimited and they will bag up extra for you to take home.  Additionally, they sell shirts that, if you wear them to the show, gives you FREE popcorn.    On top of this, they have great happy hours ($2.50 for a beer?!) and every Tuesday ALL tickets are only $6.  Amazing value.  On top of this, you get reclining seats, reserved seating, top quality picture and sound.  Gelato for during or after the movie.  I have been to roadhouse numerous times, and plan to go many many more.  Roadhouse, you guys ROCK!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time to the Scottsdale Road House Cinemas and it tops the Tucson location. The food is the same and good but the theater had better sound and feels even more roomy. Loved it!  Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to like this place, it is close to house and I was pulling for it.  I had to convince the wife to not go to Harkins Camelview and to give this a chance.  The theater and the chairs were nice, it is clear they invested a lot of money to try to make it a good experience.  However I was SO pissed over my experience with the food that it took a full hour before I was able to relax.  Wife and I order each order a drink, she got the Freebird and I got the Rooster Cogburn.  Food comes out, turns out the bartender rung in the wrong thing, says don't worry we will get it fixed.  I'm not sweating it at this point, stuff happens.  We eventfully get the right food, mine is bleh her's is okay both of our fries are cold and gross, not even the catchup could save them.  So semi incompetent service, bleh food, we are disappointed but move on.  We are late for the movie so I get the check and pay quickly so we don't miss any of the movie.  While in the theater I review the tab.  The item he rung in incorrectly is $10 on a menu, he rung it in at $15.  My dish is $10 on the menu, rung in at $15.  He charged us for the dish he rung incorrectly, then gave us a credit $3 less than what he had charged.  Normally I would raise this with the manager but at this point I was just done.  Hopefully we will get a well run theater in there someday."}
{"text":"Love the seats, great food, great place!  With that said the repetitive unbelievably boring pre show is the equivalent of hammering a nail into my own skull!"}
{"text":"As I was walking out of the theatre (with my bag of free refill to go fresh popcorn), I turned to my sister and said, \"I have to write a Yelp review about this place!\" So here I am.  I had never been here before and my sister was visiting from out of town.  She picked this place because, and I quote, \"If I'm going to watch a movie that long, my a** is going to be in a leather recliner!\"  (The movie was 2h 15 min long, which is apparently above her threshold for normal theatre chairs.)  So, off we went.  Our ticket seller was very pleasant.  We started at the popcorn counter and were immediately offered assistance.  We decided to see what our seats were like first and come back, because we weren't sure of the set up, but thought it was one of those dine-in places (which it is).  When we sat down, we were greeted by our smiling server almost immediately.  He asked if we had been there before, which we had not. \"Great!\" he exclaimed and proceeded to give us the full tutorial.  He took our drink order and let us browse the menu.  When we had finally decided, we hit our button and he was there within a minute, still smiling, and took our order of popcorn and a sweet treat.  He thanked us, hoped we enjoyed the film, and went off to put in our requests.  The popcorn was delivered the second the lights went down - perfect timing in my opinion.  A few minutes before the movie, I walk out to find the restroom.  I'm sure I had the same look everyone has on their faces when they are looking around for the restroom, and a staff member immediately (also in full smiles) asked me if I was looking for the restroom and gave me directions, and hoped I enjoyed my film.  I thanked him and went in to the large, clean restrooms.  Bonus.    The staff was courteous and efficient delivering the cheques towards the end of the film so that they were never a distraction.  Every staff member I passed leaving was in full smiles, thanked me for coming, hoped I enjoyed the film.  I was standing outside the restroom after the film, holding popcorn bowls and waiting for my sister.  Two staff members were talking.  One said, in a pleasant tone, \"let me take care of this and I'll do that\" then walked over to me, concerned, and asked if she could help me, clearly thinking I needed a manager.  I said \"Oh, no! Just waiting on my sister!\" and she smiled and said \"Oh! Okay! Thank you for coming!\"  We decided to get refills of our popcorn to go, and the staff there was just as courteous as everyone else.  It was at this point that I said I was going to have to write this review.  This is the friendliest movie theatre I have ever been to.  I have never had any complaints about the service at Harkins, (I have multiple complaints about the service at AMC).  but this place has won over my heart.  They will now have a very regular customer."}
{"text":"Vintage western decor throughout the facility makes customers feel warm and at home. Full bar and concessions area as soon as you walk in, tickets available in store. Super comfortable recliner seats and and great leg room available!  Tonight's visit started out great, ticket sales employees were wonderful with redeeming our tickets that we purchased online. They let us know that we could order any food at concessions or at our seat once we sat down, we opted for the later.  We were greeted by a server (I think) who we could tell was new, but he had good feedback and knowledge of the menu. He brought out 3 of out 5 drinks (we only ordered soda). He said that another server would bring out the other two... But they didn't come... 15 minutes later (movie about to start) No worries, we will just hit our service button and order our food and make sure the drinks come out.  Food arrived within 20 minutes and was hot, fresh, and everyone thought it was delicious!! We definitely recommend their burgers and the RoadHouse 2 person special food platter.  Unfortunately, we kept having issues getting refills. We would hit our service button and a staff member would be there polite and proper, ready to help but once they put the drink order in, it just not showing up. Then randomly a single drink from our party would come out... At one point, my little brothers' drinks took 30 minutes to be delivered.  After the movie, Hailee (Hailey) and Erica helped us figure out what went wrong. We wanted to speak with someone who could tell us how to order or how to fix the issue of the drinks and Hailee was super sweet and helpful. She found her server manager Erica and we found out that since the theatre was super packed, they had to keep changing out the syrups for the soda. She assured us that she would get on top of the staff and make sure that the orders would be brought out together and in a quicker manner.  Overall, great place to dine and catch a flick, cool atmosphere, and a staff with GREAT customer service.  Thanks Hailey and Erica for being so understanding and helpful tonight.  - Jack (Theater 10; Seat 12; 6:00pm)"}
{"text":"It's heartbreaking because I loved the one in Tucson, but they also had issues with the logistics surrounding the serving and cooking. The team doesn't seem able to handle the whole theater leaving some with long waits or no food at all.  We got to the movie 15mins before it started, ordered 10 mins before it started, and out of the six of us only 4 had gotten food within the hour.  A waitstaff came out and asked (-after I told someone we were missing food) if we were missing food. They got their food with 40 mins left to spare. We were also given a coupon for free deserts before we ordered, and got 3 out of the 6 after 30 mins and the last three while the credits were rolling. Then they still tried to charge us after we were told we would be compensated for the food that took so long to get.   Idk, I'll probably wait awhile before trying again, see if they can get their act together and get over the grand opening hump"}
{"text":"The past two times I have been here I have had a terrible experience. We had purchased tickets online yesterday for Glass Castle and unfortunately had some complications arise and we're unable to attend the showing. We had called to see if we could reschedule to a different showing and the person on the phone informed us that there was nothing they could do about it and that the $30 we spent on the unused tickets was gone.   The other time we had seen The Dark Tower and the speakers in the theater were completely blown out. It was so bad that it was more distracting and annoying to watch the movie than it was worth. The popcorn we had ordered was also very stale tasting and disappointing for the price.   The seats are extremely comfortable but I prefer to take my money to Studio Movie Grill where I know I can get fresh food, properly working theater equipment, and excellent customer service. I will not be returning to this business in the future."}
{"text":"This is our favorite dinner and movie spot. The seating is very comfortable and the food is very good, with great selection.   We have been here several times and look forward to returning again soon!!!"}
{"text":"I feel really sad to knock this theatre down to 3 stars. 9 months ago I loved it, but in the last few months, we have seen a decline in the customer service. Either we don't get our food, or popcorn or the food is just wrong compared to what we ordered. The check is always inaccurate and the Servers are nowhere to be found. We go every Friday night with another couple and it looks like we might need to try another place. It's a shame because the food quality is good, the theaters are nice and the chairs are super comfy. Every week it's now a running joke that the service can't get any worse - and then it does."}
{"text":"This cinema is AWESOME! Great menu, great drink selection, organic, non-gmo popcorn (try finding that at a theater) and the nicest, personalized customer service! Always a great experience!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! We come here for date night and definitely with the kid, especially Tuesday when it's $6 a movie ticket. Super comfy seats, GREAT popcorn, and the food is really reasonable in price and taste. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Easily our favorite theater to go to - ever. We love to take advantage of the $6 Tuesdays when we can, but if we go to a movie over the weekend we try to go to Roadhouse, even though we have moved further away.  Take advantage of the Groupon while you can!!   The popcorn cannot be beat, and while the service sometimes can be slow depending on how busy it is, the drinks are great, the seats are great, and the overall vibe is just awesome. The desserts are all made in house and you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"RoadHouse Cinema in Tucson has spoiled me and my husband for any other movie theater.  We buy our T-Shirts every year which gets us unlimited free popcorn throughout the year.  We're over 55 so when we go on Wednesday's before 4pm, our tickets are $4 each; cheaper than any other theater in town.  The plush recliners, wait staff available to bring you anything you want during the movie, great food and drinks, and lots of space between seats are just some of the reasons we keep coming back.  Roadhouse Cinema is a great entertainment experience!"}
{"text":"Loved the seats and the movie. Great value with awesome unique popcorn and pizza. Try a popcorn mix you won't be disappointed. Way to go."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the food. I come here once a week with my father. We have our favorites on the menu so we always order the same thing. I get the nachos and my dad gets a burger. Let's start with the burger. It is usually good but sometimes a little dry and always overlooked so my dad orders it med rare to get medium plus. The nachos are very good, when made correctly. There is no consistency to them though. Sometimes there is a good amount of chips with enough cheese to cover them, other times there are a pathetic amount of chips and no cheese with them. Today, I got a good amount of chips and barely, I mean barely, enough cheese for 5 or 6 of those chips. They had a lite sprinkling of lettuce on them and a few jalapeños. Nachos are chips and cheese. They should have plenty of both. Lettuce and tomato and jalapeño are extras. For the love of God, get some consistency. Plenty of chips and cheese and you will be fine."}
{"text":"This theater has not been open very long and we have already seen a decline in service and quality. Our first experience was positive and that led us to return, however, we were disappointed in the quality of the food and service overall during that return visit."}
{"text":"They have a wide selection of food and drinks and the seats are super comfy. I came with my husband twice and we had one great experience and one terrible experience. Both times we used the Groupon with the popcorn, 2 tickets, and 2 beers included. The first time was perfect. I checked the menu ahead of time because I am allergic to beer and they even have two cider options. We got there with plenty of time before the movie to order dinner and get settled into our spots. The service was great, the food was delicious, and our overall experience was as good as it gets. We left more excited about the experience that we just had than we were about the movie we saw- and it was Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 so that's saying something.  We came back in hope of seeing Wonder Woman a week after opening weekend, but the theaters were packed days ahead of time and I'd rather wait a week or two than sit in a bad seat, so we decided to see Pirates 4. We got there 30 minutes early and ordered food. When ordering the popcorn, we hesitated and the waiter started telling us about a secret menu. There were a ton of options that I can't remember, but we ended up going with the Windy City popcorn (a mix of caramel and white cheddar). When ordering our drinks I asked for a cider, but they were out of both. I asked it I could sub in a wine, but they said no. I asked if they could make an exception as I am terribly allergic to beer and I explained the extent of my allergy (long story short it isn't pleasant). He needed supervisor permission, but he came back and said they could. I saw my favorite red wine on there, but it was a couple bucks more than beer so I offered to pay the difference which they said was not needed.   The food and drink came shortly after the film started and it was great. At the hour mark, my glass was empty and I wanted to switch to a sweeter wine for dessert so I wrote down my choice, flipped the order switch, and handed the paper to a waitress without a word. The movie is pretty good so I lose track of time until my water runs out and realize it's been 30 minutes. I scribble down a request for water and the wine again with a note on the bottom saying \" * I ordered the wine 30 minutes ago, but it never came. Can you check on it?\". 15 minutes later the water and wine came and I went back to enjoying the movie.   They bring your check at the end of the film and when I was getting up from my chair I noticed that I had been charged incorrectly. They charged me for three glasses (2 of the red wine -the more expensive of the two- and 1 of the sweet wine) and applied the discount to the cheaper of the three. I half expected them to charge me for 3 instead of 2 when they forgot my wine, so I flagged someone down in the theater and an asked them to fix the charge. My husband waited for the corrected copy while I was in the restroom. He met me outside and I checked the receipt just to be safe. This time I noticed that they put the two reds again and didn't apply the Groupon this time. So we go up to the front and I get a supervisor so that I can make sure it is done right on the third try.   I explain the situation and there must have been a shift change during our movie because she gets upset that someone let me get a wine instead of beer. I go through the long spiel about my allergy again and she is still unhappy, but she walks away to fix it. We wait for about 10 minutes and I watch as they not so discretely start asking employees about our order clearly suspicious of us. Unfortunately our original waiter is gone, but the waitress who forgot about my order for 45 minutes comes and starts talking about me saying that I never put in the first drink order and that I clearly drank the sweet white before the red because that's the correct order to drink wine (normally true, but I was craving a sweet wine for dessert, plus who dubbed her the theater sommelier?). She didn't even serve me the first glass so I don't know why she is fighting so hard on this.  They come back the third time and it is done almost correctly with the white wine gone completely and just the red wine on the receipt. Since the manager and I are reviewing it together I point out that the red was the one the Groupon applied to, but that I'm tired of sitting here so to just charge my card and be done with it. She goes to swipe my card and it declines which I wasn't surprised about since it has now been charged and refunded 3 times. I call my card company and explain the situation and they unfreeze my card. By the end of that call another manager has taken over . He came to our aid, finally got it right, and apologized for the inconvenience. We left stressed out and with about $150 waiting to be refunded back to us which took a couple days.  I think this place is just new and still learning from experience so I plan to come back, but I'm going to give them a few months to get their staffing in order before returning."}
{"text":"Service was friendly. Food was great. They did forget to bring us our check until the end of the movie but wasn't a big deal. Check it out. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Wow,  it smells like a fraternity house after a kegger.  I doubt if the place has been cleaned in the last month.  Try as the might,  and despite a good start after they remodeled,  this is NOT a premium theater."}
{"text":"Great seats, food, drink and most importantly the best popcorn in town. Staff is friendly and attentive. Easy to use website to book seats. All in all the best theatre to watch a movie at."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on Tuesday (great deal for $6) and I was super excited but was very disappointed with the food service it took 90min for a sandwich (the gyro on naan). My friend who ordered to trip for 2 got her good immediately. Guess this is what happens when the movie is only $6... I will come back for a movie and maybe wine but will not order food again due to the slow service."}
{"text":"Loved this theatre! I know it has gone through many changes of ownerships in the past but they got it right this time.   Everything was spotless, I loved the rustic western decor with elegant touches. There is a full bar when you walk in, lots of seating for dining so you can come for lunch and take advantage of their lunch specials.  They also have a decent Gelato selection and a lot of yummy selections to choose from on their menu. I'd recommend the Chili con Carne. And for popcorn, I'd suggest the white cheddar flavor.  The seats were super comfortable, spacious and they recline.   Tip- check Groupon, sometimes they have good deal on tickets with beer and popcorn"}
{"text":"Had a great movie night (date night).  We arrived early enough to had a drink before it was time to go inside the theater.  Then we went in and greeted by the helpful staff and we ordered soda. Just before the movie started ordered the food. I felt took a little longer than should have but do think that a lot of orders went in about that time. Also did have to ask 2 time to have a soda refill too. Will have try it again some time."}
{"text":"Very Disappointed!   We traveled from the west valley for an evening of dinner and a movie. We arrived 30 min early so that we could order and be prepared for the movie.  It took approximately 15 mins for someone to respond to our \"button push\". After we ordered it took over thirty mins to get a beer and just about the same to get our dinner.  When dinner did arrive it was not missing items that we requested.  The cantina bowl without chicken is not somthing to write home about.  The movie was the best part but the rest was very disappointing."}
{"text":"What a great theatre! Seats are more comfortable than iPic and a lot less money. Service is amazing and we were impressed with their menu. I had their new bowl, can't remember the name, but it was rice, black beans, chicken, etc. delish! My friend had the gyro with falafel and she loved it. We will definitely be back here! If you haven't been here, give it a try...well worth it."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went here on Tuesday because it was showing The Shape of Water which I had been wanting to see. We had been here once before. We did appreciate that the movie was $6 each prior to tax. Showtime has $5 movies on Tuesday & specials on drinks as well as foods all day long. Roadhouse specials only last until 6pm. We ordered margaritas which were weak, mostly mix. So we went to bar after movie & the friendly bartender made us Long Island I've Teas. I asked for top shelf hoping they'd be stronger than margaritas. Nope. They too were weak although price was not. The personnel here were nice on this day although first time the waiter was not friendly at all. Normally we go out to dinner prior to going to movies but we thought we'd take a chance on food & drink. I guess we go back to original plans."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here all the time! This is our number one movie spot! However the past few experiences haven't been the best. At our last recent movie, the theater wasn't even ready. We got to RoadHouse at around 9:10 (our movie started at 9:30) and went into the theater. Peaked in and nothing was clean. Whatever, fine..we just gave them the benefit of the doubt that they were running just a little behind so we went back to the main lobby as sat around and looked at the menu. Around 9:20, we came back to the theater and still, nothing was clean. We waited around outside the theater until another guest had to tell a worker that the theater wasn't clean. We could literally hear the previews playing while they were cleaning. I don't understand how anyone could forget to clean a theater, honestly. Or how no one had questioned why there's a bunch of people waiting around outside the theater. It was just so displeasing."}
{"text":"I LOVE this theater and really want it to last but the service is the WORST!!! I mean the worst!!! I work in the service industry and can't believe the way the servers treat you here. I am literally watching a movie here right now with a friend and am so disappointed.  I have brought at least 5 different friends and family members here and can say that only 1 time did we have a nice and competent server, and an enjoyable experiences. I hope the owners of this theater take a hard look at there service standards because there are plenty of other theaters out there to choose from and this theater could really be a great place.  I forgot to mention that the theater is freezing cold. Almost unbearable.  My friend had to ask for some hot water so she could hold onto it. (Which also took until halfway thru the movie)   We were very excited for the Carmel pop corn but they are \"out\". When we asked if they would make more they told us that the white cheddar is the most popular so they were just going to make that. Seriously? We ate dinner here so we could have the Carmel corn as our dessert and they were so rude about it. I don't understand how a theatre, on a Sunday afternoon, is fully stocked on their products and then snuffs a customs off for wanting Carmel corn. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Nice clean atmosphere and a true hidden gem. Business will pick up based on the service as word spreads about this place. The food was great and the prices all around were good. They do have happy hour here which I haven't tried but I intend to. The popcorn is delicious, the reclining seats were ultra comfortable, and the ticket prices are similar to what you'd pay at a Harkins, not a bit over the top like iPic. I had the nacho libre with carnitas and am likely going to try the chicken next time. This review is really unordered and all over the place and I apologize but trust me you need to go here for your movie experience."}
{"text":"They have improved on they're customer service so much. My fiance and I haven't been here in a long time because the service Was rude but I have to admit it's great. We watched Tag, it was hilarious and our server was Anthony, he was nice and on very attentive. And I love the pretzel!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! We have luxury theaters in Southern California and Roadhouse puts them to shame! The ticket prices are affordable, as is the food and beverage. The four of us went we're all impressed with our meals and drinks. The wait staff was excellent. The seats were comfortable. No complaints! 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! Real reclining loveseats. The food/drink menus and condiments are located on each side. They allow you to bring in a blanket, so try not to fall asleep! ;)  They have great food, ice cream, and beer selections. Decently priced and good portions, unlike your typical cinema.  So far, we've seen Fate of The Furious and Transformers here."}
{"text":"The price and amenities are much better than other dine in theaters. They have smaller theaters but the screen size or quality is not compromised. The concession  stand had a great selection. I definitely will be back to enjoy more movies here!"}
{"text":"They deserve zero stars! Discriminatory against families with younger children. Would not let our family see a movie because we had a 5 year old with us. Discrimination at its finest. Do not give them your business!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a place!  Incredibly comfortable seats, good food and an attractive environment.    This is the way to watch a movie!   I'm in!"}
{"text":"We saw the new Captain America tonight during their soft opening and despite wanting to keep this place my secret i have to rave about it! The inside is beautiful,  the food is best out of any theater around and their service is PERFECTION! The jalapeno popcorn is incredible and their cheese dip is amazing.    Overall the staff was attentive and kind and made us feel more than welcome.    We will no longer go anywhere else for movies!!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. We went on Sunday to check out this new place, I was a pretty regular customer of the old cinema here. It is decorated really cute, has a nice large bar and dining area in the old lobby. The food was really good too, with generous portions. We had the Nacho Libre, a burger and the Children of the Corn. P.S. Their food has clever names.  The seats were super comfortable!! Better than the ones at the new Harkins, even! You do get to pick your own seats and the staff will bring the food to you. Also, the staff were amazing, super friendly and helpful.  I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Loved it!!! A little pricy, but the service was excellent and the jalapeño Popcorn was to die for, going back tonight!!!"}
{"text":"Missed the mark today in theater 11.  Have been there 4x in the last month. We asked for hot tea soda, candy. Server said they had no candy. Seriously? A movie theater with no candy?  Hot tea came out halfway through movie. At the same time our friend started to get up to let them know that they forget to bring her Pelligrino. I motioned for her to press her call button which she did. No one came. I pressed mine. No one came. Finally our server came and my friend kindly reminded her that she was still waiting for her drink and the server let her know that they were out . Seriously? At one point the server did mention that she had only been working there a month. That seems enough time to me to get the routine down. The movie finally ends and no bill. We had to go out to the lobby to look for our bill with other people. When she found us she said they were just so busy with the other theaters. So bummed as this usually is my first choice for theaters but am disappointed because a minute after we sat down I turned to my friend who had never been there and said \" They are known for their service\".  Oh well I hope this was a one time thing!"}
{"text":"Great food for a reasonable price.  Love watching a movie in a laid back lounger with my food.  Great way to spend an evening with your better half."}
{"text":"This movie theater is our favorite place for a nice date. The feel is really western; rustic woods, western fonts and etc. You can buy tickets ahead of time online or at the theater, which are assigned seats. The seats themselves are so comfy. They are sold in love seats, so they're great for a couple, and they recline!!! The food selection is really varied, from pizza to fish and chips to chicken tenders. To burgers to gelato and everything I've had there is really good."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are pretty much regulars at this place. Their seats are so comfy. Their food is delicious. I recommend the hummus and the jalapeño popcorn. I always order the ghost burger (as a veggie burger). It's great. My girlfriend and I are addicted to this place."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite movie theater! Reclining seats, you can order food which was surprisingly good! Normally not a fan of movie theater food because it's super expensive and the quality is below par but this was very good and very affordable. Craft beers from local breweries, non GMO popcorn with several flavors to choose from. $6 movies on Tuesdays and happy hour Mon-Fri 3-6pm. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Great prices. Love how all the seats recline, unlike Ipic where only the expensive seats recline. Need to advertise more so more people know about this place!!!"}
{"text":"There are three movie/dinner places that I've gone to in the valley - Studio Movie Grill, Roadhouse Cinemas, and Alamo Drafthouse. I'll try to rate them by category.  PRICE (adults): SMG: $10, but you can find Groupons RH: $10 AL: $10.50, but more on weekend  SEATING: SMG: Flip up armrests but rows alternate between countertop and swing-in table. IMHO,  you want the chairs with the swing in tables. RH: By far the best. How can you beat a leather lazyboy recliner? There is also a little light that is kind of over your shoulder that is welcome so you aren't waiting to eat during bright scenes. Lol. AL: Seating is leather but is otherwise normal theater seating with flip up armrests.  FOOD: SMG: Good food and drink. RH: Good food and drink. AL: I think Alamo has the most variety of food by quite a bit. Many people are quite fond of the bottomless real-butter popcorn.  ORDERING: SMG: Press a button and it lights up. It alerts staff to tend to you. Seems to work very well and is my favorite of the three. RH: Staff just comes by every once in a while and checks on you. I don't remember any ordering mechanism. AL: You write what you want on a piece of paper and if a server sees the paper sticking up they come grab it and put your order in. I like the alternatives.  THEATER QUALITY: SMG: As it is the oldest of the three it shows its age. I was in one theater and it had a pole in front of one of the seats. Wtf? Had stadium seating. RH: I feel like the theater was the best sound and picture but this is pretty subjective and may be influenced by the nice seats. Lol. Had the lowest stadium seating grade but still plenty to not stare at someone in front of you. Overall smallest amount of seating.   AL: good to average. Had stadium seating.  I think this is the overall feeling: If you're after price,  then go to SMG If you're after good/variety of food, then go to AL. If you're after most comfortable seating or best picture then go to RH."}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVED this place!  We were so excited to see a new theater come in, and one with full service and recliners nonetheless... heaven!  We went to happy hour prior for snacks and drinks and then the movie.  Service was great, drinks were great and food was great.  not sure what one of the yelpers was complaining about below, but then heck, seems he has reviewed everyone else a one-star, so maybe he is just a grump. :-)  Long story short... you can go to iPic for double the price or come here for a great experience and super reasonable price! :-)"}
{"text":"My Daughter and her Husband recommend this place for dinner and a movie. Oh my god, this place is amazing. I loved it. we were able to order our tickets online and choose our seats.  once we got there a staff member came out and told us how the whole thing works.  The seats are amazing electric lazy boys with a table that moves around to be in front of you. We were able to order drinks and dinner from our seats in the theater. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and some popcorn.  the server asked if she should hold the popcorn for a bit to enjoy our dinner!  the service was amazing.  The sandwich was great, the fries were great!  the food was just amazing, and I got to watch a movie while I ate it!  I cannot find one bad thing to say about this place.  ordering food from your seat and never standing in line!  I'm coming back here, in Dec when we visit and I'll be back! go try this place out, super great environment."}
{"text":"I'm giving this theatre 2 stars because they froze me to death in here this past Saturday, Cold air was blowing in my ear and down my neck. Very uncomfortable! Couldn't even enjoy the movie because of it. I asked the server is maybe he could warm things up a little bit and he said he'll ask. I think he did because the air cut off but didn't last too long. Had to put a piece of a napkin in my ear to block the draft. This has been my go to theatre for the past year with my boyfriend. If I return.....I'll be sure to bring a blanket."}
{"text":"This is my husband's and I favorite place great comfortable loungers excellent food and staff"}
{"text":"My first time at Roadhouse was in late june 2016.  I was overwhelmed with the full bar, concession stand, and full restaurant.   My server, Chris Hollis, was very knowledgeable about the menu, and recommended me to try the flavors of popcorn and explained how the ordering process works.  I would also like to point out that there was an issue with my check.   The check came incorrect and was fixed however there were 2 charges on my account.  I called and spoke with management, who addressed the situation.   I believe the name was Theresa? or Brittany, the manager happily gave me some store credit so I could go back and see the purge: election year.   I used the store credit, which I had no problems obtaining at the ticket stand.  ( I was worried that I would have to explain the situation over and over and no one would know what the heck I was talking about).   This was not an issue and I made it to my movie on time with my date.  I cant wait to go back and see star trek, and Jason bourne!!!  thanks for being awesome roadhouse!  thanks again to chris hollis, and Brittany (manager)."}
{"text":"This place is awsome. You walk in and it looks like a bar / restraint with an old wester theme with class. I got the whiskey  shake and the blockbuster  burger. Both are amazing. The whiskey shake is sweet and has a punch of the whisky to it. I also got the Greek fries also a must! The bar tender Jamie was cool too ! I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Went on Tuesday 1/3/17 for a date night. Arrived at 6:30pm for a 7pm movie, ordered our food and drinks @ 6:40. It took till 8:20pm to get our food after my husband had to ask 2 times when they thought we would be getting our food, as we watched other people get food & drinks that had shown up a while after us or even as the movie was starting. Drinks took 30/40 mins to even show up. Then after the movie we had to hunt down the waiter to even pay our bill. Over all it seems like this place won't last long as they could careless to make things right. Wrote them on the company website & got no response from them so I am posting here to warn people. Going to McDonalds or any other restaurant we would have gotten better service & probably hot food. Completely ruined our date night! As a mom these are rare so it makes it even harder that this experience was so poor."}
{"text":"$6 Tuesday's  super comfy recliners best buttered popcorn ever  refillable and diff kinds glazed caramel was delicious.  Buttons to call waiter for food drinks refills or gelato.   Other days prices same as everywhere $$ but still great theatre"}
{"text":"The service tonight was.bad. So many people working but several things went wrong with our food order and then it was at least 30 minutes for someone to straighten out after the movie ended. Some of the food was not very good on top of that."}
{"text":"Unbelievable the movie starts in 20 minutes.  Place has not been clean. The trash behind seats from many days . Absolutely disgusting i will contact their corporatio and the health department."}
{"text":"Great food comfy seats and strong drinks. I love the setup here they have an outside patio with fire pits and sometimes will have  live music it was pretty cool"}
{"text":"Age policy is ridiculous. I understand not wanting babies in this type of theatre, however, if you are going to show kids movies, you should allow kids, especially on a Saturday and Sunday morning."}
{"text":"UPDATE: lunch specials are now $8.50 Also the Happy hour 1/2 Price deal does not include those great pretzels anymore. Still only $6 for Tuesday. Best deal anywhere.   Seems like they have built a winner over here with great prices, relaxing seats and good food and service. The matinee price was only $7.95 and you select your seats and your on the way. They do charge an extra $2 online to reserve seats, but no need to waste money on that for matinee's, which in this case had only four other people present. The seats were very comfortable in full recline mode and they also have lunch specials for $7.95. Tried the Fresh turkey, bacon, green chile half sandwich and you get a side salad as well. The poppyseed dressing was great as was the real turkey and smallish lunch sandwich. Service was smooth and overall it was a nice experience for this type of business."}
{"text":"This is a tricky one... overall I felt like it deserved a 3 or 3.5 star rating because the facility was kinda dirty... more like it just didn't feel clean... BUT the staff was truly amazing! Everyone was super friendly and nice and it looks like they all have fun working together. So that bumped my rating up to a 4. Their pleasantries outweighed the grimy feeling.  The ticket prices were lower than iPic or Harkins Camelview, but when you add on taxes and fees and it pretty much works out to be about the same price.   The one differentiator that I really liked with the seating was the love-seat recliners. You could lift the arm rest up and share the space, or leave it down if you don't want to snuggle. I don't know any other theater that has this kind of seating. Most of the time it's just a bunch of single recliners with bulky arm rests so you feel separated from others. So it was nice to have a little pod type thing so you could feel cozy and like you were actually sitting together.  The other feature I liked was there was a ton of space between rows. Other specialty seating theaters try to cram as many rows in as possible, but it was really nice to have that extra leg space. You didn't feel like you were sitting on top of other people.  We were in theater nine, which I think was one of the smaller rooms. Only 5 or 6 rows of seating. It's a really long room so the screen was kinda far. But the sound was really good!! Now sure if it's truly surround sound, but it was loud and I really liked that.   One of the annoying things about the room was the Exit signs were glaringly bright, very distracting. Not sure why they were green instead of red...??   We didn't end up ordering meals this time... but we had some soda and snacks. I had some of their gelato (super yummy!!!) and we shared the Carmel corn. Free refills on the popcorn and drinks!   Circling back to the cleanliness, dirty might not be the best word... it just felt used and that it hadn't been thoroughly cleaned between shows. My table top still had wet food crumbs and grease marks. So did the arm rests between seats. The bath room felt like a swamp and was just messy with toilet paper every where.   I hope they can step up the cleaning crews, then I'd be a raving fan. For now it was a alternative theater choice, but not my go-to."}
{"text":"Comfort, service, cleanliness, and feel are all perfect. A great place to truly enjoy the experience of watching movies.  The prices are great considering the level of service.  I have only eaten here twice, but the food was great and reasonably priced. There are choices for whatever the mood from salads to good old fashioned nachos to full meals.   Full bat includes local craft beers, top shelf alcohol, and a large wine selection. My wife is a big fan of the sangria, especially when it's hot out.   This is our top or first choice now when a movie is in order.   Cheers and good eating to you."}
{"text":"I've never yelped a movie theater and I just HAD to as the best experience in ALL categories . It was thanksgiving and employees were happy, best movie popcorn  with real butter( free refills ) we've ever had -  that recline and are comfortable - Great sound system and and screen ! Well done"}
{"text":"We go to  in movie dining frequently and this was by far the worst experience we have ever had. It took 1 hour to get our drinks after asking multiple times. The excuses by our server got lamer and lamer including we are still new and they haven't worked the issues out yet. A few minutes after the drinks we finally got the food which was very good but no excuse of the horrible service."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. You have recliners as chairs, alcohol, popcorn, food, etc... all with waiters. I will definitely be coming back. Oh and Tuesdays are $6!!"}
{"text":"Took my father (on his birthday), mother, and brother to see the new Star Wars film today. Unfortunately the service was not good. Even though we arrived at 10:30 and placed our orders while the theater was still mostly empty, our food didn't come out until well after the movie had already started at 11:10. And then they only brought 3 of the 4 dishes out, and none of our drinks. We had to hit the call button twice before we finally got our complete order. Our server Brandy was great but clearly stressed as it appeared they didn't have enough people working with her. I requested a refill of my mixed bowl of popcorn halfway through the film and got a cold bowl of only one of the flavors 25 minutes later. I would have expected to see a manager checking the theater or apologizing for the service but never saw one. Picture wise, the image on the screen was way too dark at times too, it seemed like there was nobody who had taken the time to view the film and adjust the picture prior to the viewing.  It made what should have been an enjoyable experience a bit less so. Extra surprising considering we were going to a matinee showing that was their first one of the day. It is otherwise a very nice theater though, with a nice food and drink selection. A bit overpriced, but that is perhaps to be expected."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite theater!  Food options are great!  Finally a dine theater with REAL food options.  The seats are awesome!  People are VERY nice and professional.  I wish there were more locations."}
{"text":"Great place to have a drink..little food ..great popcorn ..way comfortable seats..oh ya and see a movie!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed. I really like this theater and my family and I use it quite frequently. Yesterday I used their website to get tickets to a movie. I was charged a $3 service charge and then Roadhouse billed me twice for the same seats. When I arrived at the theater I spoke with the manager Haley and was told she could do nothing about it. I would have to take it up with corporate. I emailed them as instructed and did not hear back. I called my bank this morning to cancel the second transaction. This is a lot of extra work. My suggestion is don't use the website. I was told by the manager that it happens frequently. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"We might be spending too much time at this cinema, but hey its summer in AZ and we are loving everything about it. Great movies, a variety of drinks, quality snacks, comfy chairs, personal and prompt service, full bar, Gelato...need I say more. As a matter of fact we don't alway see a movie, sometimes we go for lunch, dinner or Gelato.  I ran into a neighbor there who was picking up Dinner (to go) to take home. Did I say they have Yummy salads:) They do!"}
{"text":"We have driven by this place multiple times before but never gave it a try since there are closer theaters to our home. We ultimately decided to come because we found a pretty awesome Groupon deal - $21 for two tickets, popcorn and 2 beers/soda.   Of course, we ordered 2 craft beers. We also decided to go with the white cheddar popcorn and I think they called it 'The Great White'. Supposedly, the popcorn is bottomless and non-GMO. I'm a fan of white cheddar but I wish it had come out warm. Ours was room temperature.   While there were many options for food, we decided to split the 'Road Trip for Two' which included two pieces of quesadilla (rice, beans & cheese inside), two chicken tenders, a soft pretzel shaped like the letter 'R' and cheese sause, ranch and salsa. With that and popcorn, it was enough to fill us and we did not order more. When my boyfriend went to the bathroom, he noticed some burgers and said they looked really good! So we'll have to try it next time!  Comfy reclining seat and tray tables that are large enough to hold everything you need. Looking forward to coming here again!"}
{"text":"The management here is horrible. My fiancee lost her engagement ring after falling asleep during the movie. The general manager refused to let her back into the movie to find the ring after her movie had finished. They made us wait after another whole movie had finished and after we called the cops before going in. By then the ring was obviously stolen. We just had an over $2000 engagement ring stolen because the management refused to let my girl back into the theater room after her movie had finished. Theresa is the name of the suppose general manager. This is an insane situation. I hope theresa gets fired and the theater gives us the money for our ring."}
{"text":"Why would you change your menu without letting people know on your site? I don't care about starwars. Maybe hire more people instead of making customers mad"}
{"text":"this movie theater is ass didn't let me see a movie cause i was 16 and not 17, do not recommend they are terrible people lol and it was a PG movie let me remind you, and after finally done arguing with them for 20 min they told us there isn't even any seats available"}
{"text":"I've been on the hunt for a new theater since the AMC Esplanade has gone so far downhill and this may be it.  Ordering tickets was easy and the seats were super comfy.  Service was great and I liked writing down additional orders as that causes less interruption overall for myself and the other patrons.  My adult milkshake was good but would have been better without the whipped cream vodka (made it taste a bit cheap)."}
{"text":"Food's not that great, drinks are alright. Service is bad. I came tonight with a friend, we both ordered drinks. No problem. Friend ordered food, bartender took his order, didn't bother to ask if I wanted anything and then became too busy to catch her attention. Ended up with a margarita, but not the one I ordered because they were out of blackberry & zero food. Do yourself a favor and go to the AMC Esplanade where the food & the service is better.  Post review note: I've now been sitting here 30 minutes while my friend has finished his meal & still no one has asked me if I want anything other than the margarita I ordered 35 min ago."}
{"text":"Maybe they were having an off night but we arrived early and put our food order in early, 1.5 hours later and the food still hasn't arrived, even after asking about it twice. With about 20 minutes left our food finally arrived after asking the manager about it the 3rd time. They also talk about their bottomless popcorn bowls which may be true if they ever actually bring the refill. Overall really poor experience and probably wouldn't return."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite movie theatre. My husband and I go once a week. We love the seats and the popcorn. The service is usually amazing, but we did have quite a few hiccups last night, but I think they might be training new staff. One time - I can forgive them. I just hope it doesn't become the norm.  I'm happy for them that they are so busy that they need more staff, but I'm sad for me bc I love this jewel and want it to myself. The popcorn : hubby loves the plain with butter. I love the cheese so you can do half and half. The food: I've had the burger, chicken fingers and fries, cantina bowl, nachos, and cool hand luke salad. The food is decent, but not gourmet. I'm OK with that though bc it is movie theatre after all. Their fries are really good! The drink: I hate that they have Pepsi vs coke, but they have tuscon blonde beer - love that.  For the price and experience I prefer roadhouse to ipic and all harkins."}
{"text":"Theme: Cowboy Saloon is excellent Food: opted for bottomless popcorn  Regular without butter=delicious Jalapeño= nice kick, with jalapeños on top (Jalapeños were a little weird tasting) Popcorn wasn't hot, which I personally don't enjoy. Service: prompt and friendly  Theater: sound was awesome! Nice and cool temperature!! Seats were comfy."}
{"text":"This is a review only for the ticket clerk \"Mercedes\"   Walk into movie theater at 615.  Ask for 2 tickets to a movie at 655  Sells us tickets for the 545   No big deal. Mistakes happen.   Another associate walks us back to the ticket taker who says \"i sold them the tickets they asked for. It isn't my fault they can't tell time\"   Really? You could have just silently reprinted the tickets for a different time but you had to insult us?!  You're lucky I wasn't wearing my \"let me speak to the manager\" pants and just wanted to see the movie.   Poor customer service Mercedes. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"Great place. Food is good and great variety. Pricing is unbelievable for a movie theater.  I would come for drinks and food the theater is also awesome."}
{"text":"Wow! great popcorn with jalapenos! really good service! the beer was around $5-$6 which i liked cause it wasnt over priced. very comfy seats!"}
{"text":"Place was awesome!!! Great seats, terrific food and wonderful service. Not to mention wayyyy cheaper than the other dine in movie theaters in Phoenix but still get the high quality experience. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I love this theater. I was in Scottsdale Az for corporate training and have an evening off. I chose right to spend it at The Roadhouse. The food was good, the beer was great, the service was the best. Why the 4 stars.  Unfortunately, I didn't get to see the movie I wanted. It is very limited and selective in what they will show. Overall I have a wonderful time."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service-- manager Selena obnoxious and condescending. Ugh! They advertise senior price before 4 pm and when I arrived at 3:45 pm the charged full price because the movie started at 4:05...what a crock. I won't be coming back. I hate deceptive advertising..."}
{"text":"I love going to the movies, and i love eating out.  This place combines both for a great experience!  The menu is small but i guess that keeps it fast. The food is above average and well prepared.  The service is very good, prompt and non intrusive so you can watch the movie in peace.  I love the recliners and the roominess in the theaters.  Good crowds and good management."}
{"text":"I love this theater.  What a concept!  The seats are high quality recliners and there is so much space between the rows that you aren't going to get kicked by someone's jerkoff kid, and you might even be far enough away from those people who eat their popcorn with their mouth open and who play with their Twizzlers wrapper the entire movie.  We've been here twice and enjoyed both visits.    The first time we had eaten before we got there, so we just ordered a beer.  I love that they have a good variety of local brews to choose from.  And the prices are what...$5.25 or $5.50 a pint?  Something like that.  Perfectly reasonable.  We saw some of the food go by and wanted to at least try a burger on our next visit.  One thing I also liked a lot about our first visit was that a server stopped by our seats before the movie and asked us if it was our first time.  When we told him it was, he went through a rundown on the ordering and check delivery process.  It was smooth sailing.  The only complaint I have is that it was kind of hot in the theater.  Usually I'm freezing my jumblies off in a movie theater, but it was a little warm on this visit.  The second time it was cool in the theater and we did try a burger.  We shared the Tombstone burger ($10.50) and enjoyed that very much in spite of the fact that they cook all the burgers medium well.  Come on now.  Let me have a medium or medium rare burger.  I can handle it.  The burger does not come with any fries.  You have to order those separately.  My husband had a beer and I tried their sangria which was very refreshing.  I could have had 3 or 4 of those but managed to control myself.    Overall I'm very impressed with the quality and variety of food & drink options, friendly staff, and comfortable seats.  We'll be back many times."}
{"text":"I am head over boots for this place! They completely re-did the entire theatre and it's cowboy chic. For someone who doesn't like spending time to watch movies, they've hooked me on wanting to see every film out just to get to go back.   For two student tickets on a Thursday night for a brand-new movie it was $18. We ordered beers and an appetizer platter for a grand total of about $50. The food was a little expensive, but that's expected at a movie theatre. It's definitely worth it. I really appreciate their multitude of vegetarian and vegan options! They have black bean burgers that you can replace any of the regular burgers with.   The seats were so comfy! You could fully recline and put the arm rest up to get cozy with your partner.   It's a great spot for a first date or a family outing. I'd recommend trying to go during lunch or happy hour to save money and still enjoy the full experience. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Can I say that this was the best movie experience I have ever had.  The theatre we were in was small - perhaps 32 - 40 seats in total.  The fact that the chairs fully recline is just amazing.  While we only ordered popcorn, and some drinks, the menu appears to offer a wide range of options at reasonable prices.  The movie ticket prices were on average $12 and included a $1 processing fee to execute an online reservation.  My only issue for improvement is that my coffee was cold when served.  The theatre seemed to be a bit empty on Saturday night so I worry about the ability to survive.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"*Beware Food Poisoning!!* Last night my boyfriend and I decided to go to RoadHouse, in all honesty we would have been better off going to a regular movie theater. It all began with poor service, one item of the food we ordered came out before our beers. We had to ask the server who brought out our food (not our original server) for the rest of our meal. We ordered the jalapeno popcorn, two beers, and a pizza. About 10 minutes later the rest of our order arrived. We just thought of it as a slight annoyance and nothing more. It was only after the movie was over is when we experience pure agony. As we were walking to the vehicle we noticed that our stomachs felt a little funky. We decided to take a couple Tums to help with the problem, sadly that did not work. For the rest of the night we suffered from food poisoning. It was the worst food poisoning I have ever encountered. Just save your money and go to a regular movie theater because this is not worth the food poisoning. **** This is the same review I left on Google."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite place to watch a movie. The seats are the new fancy recliners and it also has a slide table.  The menu is pretty good for a movie theater.  There are so many options and you can find something for everyone.  Even GELATO!!!  We have come here four times so far.  My only complain is that the last time I was there I had to go to the box office with my printed tickets.  I pay the extra money buying online to avoid standing in line to get my tickets.  I am not sure why they changed that.  None of the other theaters do that."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place, the seats are really nice! We didn't know what to think before we arrived and we're just planning on getting soda and candy and they do not have a large selection. Only 3 to be precise. The server scared the crap out of me when he dropped the check off to be signed. Wouldn't have been alarming if I knew! Overall I'd say check it out and come hungry, the menu looked yummy!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to catch a movie, drinks, dinner, snacks or munchies. I have never had a problem making reserving seats. Prices are reasonable. A little something for everyone on the menu. This time I had a salad and it was really good. Service was quick and efficient. The seats are clean and comfortable. I would recommend that they have more of a selection of movie type candy, snacks and more variety of desserts for those want a bit of a traditional movie experience or for kids expecting their favorite candy."}
{"text":"Trying to purchase tickets for Friday, it is Monday and still no movie times up for Friday, it's Monday..Seriously how are these people still in business, I'm sticking to Harkins."}
{"text":"Love the seats. Watched the The Post on a Sunday afternoon. $50 with popcorn and two beers.  Expensive for two hours.  We normally go on Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon for cheap seats and Happy Hour.  Same two hours $23. Wish they had independent films but still enjoy visiting Roadhouse a few times a year.  Popcorn is the best."}
{"text":"This is my favorite movie theater!!  Amazing service!! Today the manager help us with a gift card, and the system did not accepted, but he knew how to handle and made us arrive to our movie on time.. Good job Josh you are a Great manager C.S. oriented!!!"}
{"text":"I was so impressed with the staff.  Nearly all of them said hello as I entered and to have a good night when I left.    There is assigned seating with your own cup holder, swinging table, and reclinable leather chair.  I hadn't tried any of the entries, but the gelato I had was astounding.  I had dark chocolate and I swear it tasted like frozen chocolate mousse.  And then I sampled the strawberry cheesecake and it had the sweet tartness of actual cheesecake.  So good.    Final awesome thing, a $9.95 price tag for an after matinee movie.  It was all around an awesome experience."}
{"text":"We're back for $6 movie Tuesday.  Can't wait for a great beer and some delicious food with great hospitality!!!"}
{"text":"We usually go to Harkins Camelview but thought we would give this place a try. Strongly regretting it. The staff is incredibly slow and rude. Ordered a second drink about 45 mins into the movie.... it literally took over 45 minutes to get a second gin and tonic, the simplest drink to make. AND my boyfriend left the theater after half an hour to check on our drinks. They were not busy. After the movie he went to speak with a manager about how slow the drinks were. Went back into the theater thinking I was still there to get me and overheard the staff literally mocking him for checking on our incredibly slow drinks. I didn't even finish my last drink because I got it about 10 minutes before the movie was over. We won't be returning here (even though the manager gave us free movie tickets I don't even think it's worth that to come back here and get no service and to be made fun of) ... no thank you."}
{"text":"This is a great Movie house. The chairs we were in didn't work but they were able to move us to decent seats. The food was great. I had the pulled pork and fries. Delish. The staff was friendly and efficient. The downfall was how cold the theater was and the bathrooms weren't kept up and we went the at 11am. I recommend this place highly!"}
{"text":"Great place. Food is good however if you want strawberry sorbet don't hold your breath, always out."}
{"text":"Lets start with cleanliness. This place never even feels remotely clean. Whether its the seats in the theater or the nasty bathrooms. It makes you wonder what the kitchen looks like.  The food I can't say i have tried much but last time I tried to order a dessert, basically all the options on the menu were not actually available that evening. However the best was my last visit where I decided to order some Gummy Bears. We all know candy at any theater is a rip off but this was well lets say a surprising experience. So my gummy bears show up and all I can say is I wish I took a picture. They literally handed me a ziplock bag with some Gummy Bears in it. The bag didn't even look like a new ziplock bag like there is a possibility the reuse the bags.. LOL. I mean I was expecting a package of some obscure brand perhaps of Gummy Bears but a handful of Gummy Bears in a ziplock is laughable to try to pass off.   The other funny experience was sitting through the same set of previews twice for some reason. Like we sat through 20 minutes of previews only for them to start over and replay again before the movie started.   They really need to get things together at this place. Its a convenient location and the pricing is fair for a movie these days but this feels more like a dollar movie experience and often the crowd in there reflects the same."}
{"text":"Wow!! This place will have you dancing in your underroos. No joke I think tickets were around $9 for assigned seats with reclining and seat side service. Compare this to the new camelview at Harkins which offers reclining seats at a $14 flat rate to include the matinee. Needless to say I'll never be going to Harkins Camelview. Also the food was very delicious. Wouldn't hesitate to come back. Looking forward to spending lots of time here. It's really the best!"}
{"text":"Went here for a date night, it was our first time here. The service was awesome and food was amazing! We will definitely go back here for another date night!"}
{"text":"WORST movie experience ever. Yes the seats were nice  but it is not worth going to.  SEATS: yes they are plush power recliner love seat style, however my dads seat was broken and did not recline (theatre 2 seat F5).   MOVIE: Went to see a 7pm showing of Star Wars. This is a movie theatre which has in theatre dining which means you arrive early to sit in your reserved seats and order food and drinks.  This movie theatre was still being cleaned until 7:05p so so by the time someone was taking my dinner order (and my 6 other movie goers) it was 7:18 and the star wars movie had begun. The wait staff was then still taking orders for 10-15 more minutes. This was very disturbing.   FOOD: I ordered a burger and pub fries (that come with chipotle ranch), and my son ordered \"loaded fries\" with regular ranch. He got regular fries with no ranch, and I got a burger and fries with no ranch. My other attendees were missing similar items like utensils for food, or red pepper flakes for a pizza. At 8:05 the server came back and told me they were out of the fries topping because my son ordered loaded fries. I walked out of the movie and found a manager who I explained the situation to and she said she would take some $$ off our bill.  When our check came, no discount was given. We did find the manager who just said she was again sorry, she took 30% off our bill and we left swearing to never go back again.   I have been to MANY dine in luxury theaters and this has to have been the WORST movie experience."}
{"text":"Very comfortable seats with foot rests, good food, and attentive service at your seats.  Eat before in the front restaurant, hard to see food at your seats.  Only negatives was soggy popcorn (even after 2 replacements) and VERY loud movie sound (Rouge One).  Glad I had earplugs."}
{"text":"Downgrading my previous rating because Roadhouse can't seem to stock their full menu.  They seem to repeatedly be \"out of stock\" on multiple items from their menu.  They either need to update their menu removing items or fully stock their kitchen so that they can deliver on the menu as promised.  Also know they tend to keep the theater quite cold inside.  When it is 110 degrees outside this is great, but when it is 50 degrees outside it is uncalled for.  Complaints to wait staff about the temperature are ignored.  Similarly, some theaters at Roadhouse have the sound system turned up too loud.  The wait staff won't look into this when complaints are lodged.  I enjoy surround sound and movie sound effects as much as anyone, so for me to complain about this means the sound levels are at least 10dB above where they should be for  a proper movie experience."}
{"text":"Easily now our favorite theater in the area. This place is so clean and comfortable! Staff went out of their way answer any questions. In my opinion this is a slight upgrade over the AMC camelback esplanade theater & blows Studio Movie Grill out of the water. Will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"Love the separation between rows - great menu - local brews - and Dakota provided excellent service!  We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite movie theaters in the Phoenix area and I've been to recently.  While i've been a fan of all the new dine in theaters that have been popping up this one has slowly become my favorite.  AMC started with a great concept at their biltmore location but the corporate machine slowly took over and everything got an overhaul which meant smaller seats, more expensive food and worse quality.  Roadhouse on the other hand has large comfortable seats, great food at reasonable prices and a great bar!  As you walk inside Roadhouse you are greeted by a huge open space with wood beams and a cabin in the woods feel with a sprawling bar and large tv's.  I've come here hours early with friends before just to hang out before the movie for food and drinks.  Their prices are not bad at all, especially if you come during happy hour when Beer, Wine, and margs are all half off.  3 bucks a beer is a great deal no matter where you go let alone in a movie theater!    Tuesday's are 6 dollar movies all day all night which makes for another great value.  They also have a large patio section with comfortable patio chairs for hanging out.  Great place when the weather is nice.    The service in the theater is pretty standard.  You push your button and they come take your order.  Burgers are great and their fries are delicious.  They even have gelato and a whole slew of other great looking desserts. I hope Roadhouse is around for a long time to come as it's the only place i really go see movies now!"}
{"text":"I think I could go here everyday for the goat cheese brûlée. I am a cheese lover to the max and this creation makes me crave it when I am not eating it. Their specials seem to be on point (bison lamb burger was amazing) and the truffle fries are soooo yummy. Love the idea and being able to have a margarita while enjoying my movie is never a bad thing! My boyfriend raved about the candied jalapeños in the popcorn, and we both devoured the banana dolce gelato (we should stop sharing and get our own) honestly other than that the food was slightly disappointing with pretzels being stale and chicken fingers \"rubbery\" (IMO) and the cheese pizza isn't bad...and most of the time the service seems to fit the food, slightly sub par-besides the things stated above-until we met Marisa. What a doll and made us feel so welcome sitting at the bar. She had suggestions, made great conversation and really made us feel like regulars. We are starting to come even when we aren't going to see a movie- great happy hour and reverse happy hour!! Also all movie tickets $6 Tuesday's can't beat that!!!!"}
{"text":"The name kind of throws you off but we finally decided to try this place. It was literally a ghost town when we got there and we had the entire theater to ourselves. Literally. It's too bad because this place is hands down one of the best theater experiences. Better than Studio Movie Grill or iPic. The price is great and so is the food. Theaters are \"intimate\" but every seat is a recliner. I really hope this place sticks around."}
{"text":"Very comfortable theater with wide reclining chairs, very wide aisles between rows, and stadium seating. Add that to an unusually above par menu with wait service, and it's a winner! Currently, they offer these specials: $6 Tickets on Tuesday's all day for everyone; $4 Senior tickets before 4 pm, Monday through Friday; and they have a Groupon/Living Social coupon you could purchase that allows you to enjoy a $20 \"lunch for two\" for $13 (Choice of anything on the menu! We usually get two lunches and two drinks.) Great way to enjoy a first run movie, in a very comfortable setting, and a great lunch for $21-25, not including tip.)  And they also have great desserts crafted by their dessert chef, and 4 kinds of popcorn with free refills: plain or with REAL butter; caramel; cheese; or jalapeño. Like I said, it's a wonderfully unique experience!"}
{"text":"I think this place exceeded my expectations by far, I recently bought a groupon from them that included two movie tickets, a huge popcorn, and two beverages (all for 20 bucks!). The theater is a little difficult to find, and you don't purchase tickets outside, or show your voucher there, you go inside to the counter and have them redeem it. The seats are all really great, and the white cheddar popcorn was delicious. I like the quality of the chairs quite a bit as some of the places I've been they've been so-so. Service is great for drinks (I cannot vouch for food as I have never had anything but the popcorn) but it didn't look too awful. The one complaint I have is that depending on where you are in the theater the women's restroom is decently far away from the men's room. All in all I will definitely come back! On tuesdays they have $6 specials!"}
{"text":"Our group ate 3 times in Roadhouse Sctdl dining area with Groupon promos. Positives: servers were friendly and respectful and food was tasty.  However getting the food was another story. Service was consistently SLOW. it was fortunate that no one in our group had other commitments because each time it took a minimum of 45 -60 min before we got our orders. Tip: ask to have your soft drinks or water filled at the concession stand instead of the bar or else you'll receive drinks with a nasty chemical taste."}
{"text":"This is the only way to see a movie in theaters! You can't go wrong with the movies, food choices, and prices! I've been to this location three time and had wonderful experiences each time. The staff is very friendly and attentive. If at anytime you need something press the call button on your seat and they're there within minutes. The sofa like chairs recline and honestly it's like watching a movie on a bed they're super comfy. I without a doubt recommend this place for great meals and an awesome movie viewing experience!"}
{"text":"They got the goldie locks of margaritas. In my experience the ones at AMC desert ridge are too sour, and the ones at Studio Movie Grill are too watered, but theirs are just right. What I did not appreciate is that the sandwich I ordered took forever and then when it gets to me it was no longer at the right temperature. That means that it was most likely sitting on the counter and left there too get cold... And then they make an error on my card and get double charged. This is a problem I don't experience in any other similar theaters, but it got properly refunded, so I move on. There's definitely a lot of other food options I want to try, plus the ambiance is pretty cool as well, so I would definitely come right back."}
{"text":"Just left the Roadhouse Cinemas for the first movie experience and just loved it!!!! Prices are the same for the movies, margarita was very good and beer was excellent, bar food was great and prices for food are better than the regular theater and are much tastier!!!!! They even wait on you - way better than at home!!! I want to live there!!!! Highly recommend - check out their happy hour and weekly specials, they look great!!!!"}
{"text":"Ever dreamed of having your own reclining chair with a giant screen to watch your all time favorite super hero going across the screen, well, this place made my dream come true *sparkles*  This is a luxury dine in movie theater and out of all the ones i have been to across the valley, the food and chairs is all I care about.  All you gotta do is go online, reserve your favorite seats, come in abouttttt 10-15 minutes early. The server will greet you and you can flip through your menu or buzz them later... I always get their caramel popcorn (I like their jalapeño ones too) and then once the movie starts I recline the plushy chair back and I'm all settled in with my blankie.   The floor is carpet so you hardly hear any noise of people running up and down the aisle trying to take orders or leave for bathrooms. They're pretty fast on delivering your food. And the staff are always friendly and very quick to get the job done. You don't see people in front of you nor behind you.   Food is actually really good. I love their truffle fries and chicken tenders. My little brother loves their root beer float and pizzas. While the boyfriend loves their nachos and burgers. They haven't failed our tastebuds!  Overall, I believe the price is well worth it as you can reserve your seats without having to worry about where you'll be. No people kicking your chair. You're in a luxury plush reclining chair. The food is pretty good. The sound system is epic. And you don't have to worry about carrying your food and spilling your popcorn along the way. :)"}
{"text":"Love this theater! The theme is really fun. I gravitate towards the appetizer menu and I got to say the my favorites are the fries. There are other great options too. The only reasons I gave a 4 star review is because there are some simple housekeeping opportunities and the tea I got last visit tasted awful. I haven't had a problem before so I assume it was just a one time bad batch.  Otherwise, friendly staff, great atmosphere, and really comfortable viewing experience."}
{"text":"For the price this place is great, the tickets are around 10$. The seating and menu is good. They have a full bar and the place is never busy. The parking is easy too."}
{"text":"First time I've been here & it will not be my last. What an awesome theater. Excellent service! Waiters are fast when you hit the button. large variety on the menu to order from."}
{"text":"HappyHour during the week which includes some food. Popcorn with jalapeños is delicious. Seats are comfortable, huge assortment of treats. Food & drink (both alcoholic and nonalcoholic) service in the theatre without a ridiculous service fee was nice."}
{"text":"This place is a joke.  Reserved seating is so limited it's terrible.  They play the good movies in the smaller Theater and the lame movies in the bigger theater."}
{"text":"The staff here is extremely warm, friendly and courteous. As soon as we entered the venue, we were greeted and the cashier welcomed us and informed us on everything available to the guests.   Michael went out of his way to help out and provided excellent service.   The food selection, happy hour items/ prices, and the drinks are great.   The seats are soft reclining leather and super comfortable; Better than other dine in theaters I have visited.   Tuesdays they feature $6 films, and reverse happy hour (starts at 9)   Great first experience. Will be back frequently."}
{"text":"Roadhouse we're breaking up.  It was a nice relationship and so close to my house and while we have had some good times at the beginning it's time for me to move on.  I can't go anymore nor can I recommend you to friends ...and it's sad.  You got lazy and skimped on service.  Our nights together have been a series of mistakes lately.  You've closed the kitchen on us right when our movie started.  My kids were not pleased.  You've lost my gift cards twice and forgot to use them to pay my bill.  You gave my wife a 1/4 full glass of wine.  You forgot my food order multiple times.  You left ADA sound on for the entire Star Wars movie.  You've forgot to clean the hallways. You skimped down the menu during the holidays as you could not handle the people coming to your theater.   It's time that I admit to myself that I can't trust you anymore.  I liked so much of what you had to offer - the food and drink selection is the best. But sadly you just can't deliver consistently.  I'm open to getting back together but you need to admit you have a problem and fix things - or I'm afraid you won't be around much longer."}
{"text":"I just went to Roadhouse cinemas for the first time! I think the theater is awesome!! I love the unique menu and the half priced apps and drinks. I went to see a movie at 8:45 and unfortunately by the time we went to order food our server said \"everything is basically closed\".. in my opinion they should keep the kitchen open as long as they have movies playing. We don't control the movie times however they are able to adjust them if they're trying to close the kitchen at a certain time"}
{"text":"Worst service, food, drinks and customer service I've ever experienced. It took 30 minutes to receive our cold food, which showed before our drinks? I ordered a frozen margarita that came melted and when I explained to the server that I wasn't happy with the drink she advised me that it would be up to the manager if he would take it off the bill or not. I also requested to pay cash, they asked for a credit card and assured me it wouldn't be ran. They charged me for the margarita and ran my card. I talked to the manager after the movie and explained to him what happened and he told me he legally couldn't remove liquor from the bill. He accused me of drinking it even after I explained it had melted and that's why I wasn't happy. Needless to say at roadhouse the customer is wrong and I won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I are from out of town and wanted to see a movie after dinner. Roadhouse Theater came up on movie phone with the movie time we wanted. We didn't realize until we got there that it is a dine in theater, and it was opening day. The staff is friendly, the seats are comfortable and the theater is clean. This place is awesome!  Great date night place."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. We usually go to SMG and wanted to try something new.  Wow! It doesn't disappoint. Kids had gelato and we really enjoyed the bottomless popcorn.  Great selection of beers on tap and the bartender was super nice.  Loved the reclining chairs and service was good. Only downer were the nachos.  They weren't good."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this theater but it didn't happen.  The service was not good and the food was cold when it arrived.  Very disappointing and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Let me start with the positives. On Tuesday their movies are $5. They have a happy hour that includes some of their alcoholic beverages and a few appetizers. They have 4 different flavored popcorns and if you wear their popcorn shirt you get a free large popcorn that is refillable.   Negatives though, there are only 3 items on the happy hour appetizer menu. 2 of those items are very similar. Nachos and then chips and salsa. Not a big variety. Their buttered popcorn has absolutely no flavor. Their cheddar popcorn and caramel though is good. My server completely forgot about my drink and didn't know whether or not their root beer was caffeine free or not.   The chips for the chips and salsa didn't taste salty to me, which is good if you're on a low salt diet like me. Their regular buttered popcorn didn't taste salty either - which is good for my diet but it doesn't taste good. Bring fake salt to add to their popcorn if you want. Not sure how much salt their caramel corn or cheddar one had but based on what I know about those two flavors, the cheddar probably had tons.   The seats were comfortable and their desserts looked amazing. Thought about trying their gelato. If I come back again (only if someone else picks this place, wouldn't be my first choice) I'd try one of their desserts."}
{"text":"This is by far the nicest theater I've ever been to. The tickets are reasonable, the chairs are very comfy, service is great and the food is amazing. Not to mention the sound and picture quality... It's incredible. It's my go-to theatre."}
{"text":"What a great find! Visiting Scottsdale we decided to take in a movie and purchased reserved seats to view Sully. The theater has a restaurant, bar and gourmet snack shop. Theaters are small with perhaps five rows of fully reclining leather chairs. Each chair has a swing in table and button for service. Order gourmet flavored popcorn and it is served in a nice bowl. Hungry and want more, they offer unlimited refills as well as refills on their large soft drinks. The quality of the picture and sound are excellent as is the comfort of the seats. Our biggest surprise was the price. Two reserved tickets $15.90. Unlimited refills of soda and popcorn served to you in your seat amounted to less than $12.00. Once you experience a movie here you will not want to go anyplace else."}
{"text":"Such a cute movie theatre! On Tuesdays movies are only $6. After 9pm some alcoholic beverages and dippers are half off. I thought the food was priced pretty low compared to other movie theaters. The best part is the reclining seats and you get to choose where you want to sit!"}
{"text":"I will give it 5 stars for the comfort, but 1 star for food. I have eaten better meals from McDonald's.  I am not trying to be overly harsh, but no bueno.  the Carmel Corn looked tasty.  Great place to watch a movie, but for my Dine In Theater dollars, AMC Dine in at the Esplanade is a way better value."}
{"text":"My sister-in-law took me here yesterday for the first time and I was skeptical at first because I usually stick to iPic in Scottsdale Quarter. However, this place exceeded my expectations by far. The food is actually GOOD, not mediocre like other full service theaters I've been to and their prices are on point! They do \"Happy Hour\" every Tuesday so movie tickets are only $6 ALL DAY! Seats are clean, comfortable and fully recline as well."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great beer. Great servers.  Great seats.  Horrible customer service and website.  They update their site a day or 2 before, so there's no way to purchase tickets in advance.  I was also told by a kid on the phone they have an app that is more updated than the website, but I did not find an app on the apple App Store. I do recommend this theater over other dine in theaters, but they need to fix their website and step up the customer service."}
{"text":"I love this new place! I went today with two friends to see \"The Nice Guys\". I selected my tickets online and checked in at the box office and was surprised to be greeted by one of the owners, Vincent. We were given a tour of the facility including a peek into the kitchen, Vincent even took it upon himself to change our seats for optimum viewing. We ordered our food and it was delicious, Cuban sandwich, Greek salad and Angus Burger with Greek fries. The hospitality was insanely good, the facility was beautifully designed and the overall experience was fantastic! I will not spend another penny at Ipic now that this place is in business. I would highly recommend that you check it out!!! I forgot to mention that all of the theaters within have comfy leather recliners!!!  Still loving this place, now with $6.00 Tuesday's!!! We saw \"Ghostbusters\" and Victoria was our server. (She was awesome!) We split the \"Freebird\" sandwich with fries. This sandwich was so good that I would return to order it again, movie or no movie, and the spicy sauce for the fries....yummy! This place does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Visited this theater twice on a trip to Scottsdale last weekend. Loved it! Wish we had one of these in Salt Lake. The Greek fries were AMAZING. I'm still dreaming about them a week later. The strawberry cheesecake looked amazing and it tasted ok, but not worth $9. Just get the fries. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Tickets for two adults one child...$38 (side note, I should also mention they consider children to be over the age of 6 and don't allow children under the age of 6). The food bill came to $70...this was for 3 fountain drinks (which run about $4 or $5 each), two burgers, one of which was a plain cheese burger, two orders of fries (because EVERYTHING on the menu MUST be ordered a la carte) and a popcorn.  The popcorn ($8) I ordered was the jalapeño one. It was supposed to come with slices of jalapeños all over it. It did not. It also had a weird powder seasoning on it. I sent it back and opted for just the original popcorn with butter, Children of the Corn, I believe it was called. That also tasted awful so we didn't eat it.  We got one Blockbuster burger with a steak meat patty ($10), one plain Cheeseburger ($10) which they still charged us the price of the Blockbuster Burger), Pub fries ($6), Buffalo chicken sandwich ($10) and Southwest Loaded fries ($6). All the food was just edible, at best. Nothing special to warrant their prices.  We didn't bother to order a dessert because we didn't feel like paying $10 for a slice of cheesecake.  With prices like these and forced to pay for everything separately, our money could have been better spent elsewhere.  3 out of 10...would not recommend."}
{"text":"GREAT THEATRE!!  Serves food and spirits. Free refill on popcorn. Best movie theater ever."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here about a month ago on Tuesday for $6 date night Tuesdays. It was awesome to find a theater that had such a cheap admission price and even better that it was at a dine-in theater. There was even happy hour when we went and the deals were great! The food and drink selection was much better than other dine-in theaters in the Phoenix area. We enjoyed our beers and the food that we ordered. Our server was genuine and attentive to us and everyone she was serving. Though we were seeing the later movie on a Tuesday night, we did not get any negative response from any of the employees at the theater which was nice. The chair were comfortable and the theater was well-kept. When you first enter the theater, there is a large bar lounge area with a patio. Next time we visit I wouldn't mind spending in the bar prior to seeing the movie!"}
{"text":"I have loved every experience I have had here! Great movies, drinks and food!! I will keep coming back and referring all of my friends!!"}
{"text":"We've come here a few times and had a great experience. Today, not so much. I purchased tickets earlier this week for Despicable Me 3 knowing I could reserve seats for a new movie. I never received my email with my ticket confirmation. Not a huge deal as they could check me in with my debit card.   We ordered sodas and the caramel popcorn. (Popcorn is unlimited.)  Our drinks came and everyone around us is getting their meals, but still no popcorn for us. The movie has already started and we were in our seats 15 minutes before showtime. I pushed the call button and asked our server Garrett. He said they are out of the caramel popcorn and are making more. In the meantime he will bring us some other popcorn, what kind would I like. I say buttered. Then out comes some old burned caramel popcorn with tons of kernels in it. Shortly after comes a bowl of white popcorn (no butter). The kids inhale the caramel popcorn since it's a 5:15 show and we haven't had dinner. By the time the bowl starts getting low I asked for the popcorn refill. It never came. After a good while I hit the button to check on it. Garrett said it will be out in 8 minutes. Again lots of time passes and nothing. I push the button again. Another server comes and says he will check into it would I like another flavor if they're out? He heard they're making more. I said I heard that when the movie started, I don't want another flavor. Still nothing. At this point the movie is almost over. Garrett comes to bring our check and says he's sorry and will give us a popcorn voucher. Never did.   We ended up not leaving a tip and I NEVER do that. What was so hard? It was an entire movie and we never got a refill and what we got from the start was gross. Why even charge us for the popcorn?  It was $7.95 which is completely reasonable with refills. I just couldn't take all the excuses. No updates on anything unless I pushed the button and initiated it. Kind of ridiculous.   The movie was great, the seats are great, the service was lacking. It's a pretty decent drive for us, I don't think we'll bother anymore. Just hit the AMC at Desert Ridge instead."}
{"text":"Although I have not actually eaten a full meal here, I'm going to award my movie-going experience with the coveted 5th star.  I'm actually hesitant to write a review for fear everyone will know what I know, and I'll have to start buying tickets online and dealing with that nonsense.  But then again, if no one goes, I'll be out of luck in 6 months.  So what do I love?  1. Ticket prices are a very reasonable $12.50 for evening showings, and I believe they are $9.95 for weekdays.  Compare this to the new Harkins at Fashion Square which is a far less desirable theater in my opinion, yet is substantially more expensive. 2.  Popcorn is served in a bowl with butter, not butter flavoring.  Only one price $7 ($8 for specialty) and it's all you can eat.  In fact, you can bring your bowl back at the end and they will give you a giant bag to take home.  And I am not kidding when I say giant. 3.  Comfortable recliners and all seating is love seats (a pair with a moveable arm rest between them). And the pair next to you is spaced appropriately.  No shared cup holders.  You don't feel like you're lying in bed next to a stranger (again, Harkins missed this).  And the theaters are relatively small. 4.  Back to the food, or the drinks.  $3.95 for standard fountain drinks of 32-oz with unlimited refills. But I'm a fan of the keg root beer for $4.95 which includes only one refill, but is more than plenty.  And yes, never fear drunkards, a full bar is available. 5.  Other fun snacks like gelato creations, gourmet candies, soft pretzels (think pub, not kiosk), not to mention full blown meals.  And speaking of meals.  If you don't want to eat in your seat, the lobby has service and seating as does the patio.  What don't I love?  The popcorn is a double-edged sword.  I don't always get it because I know I will feel I must eat $7 worth.  I would LOVE if they offered a single serving option.  Take a couple bucks off and give me no refills.  Use a different colored bowl or a bag.  Something.  Don't make me sad that I have to say no."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I'm going to the Camelback Esplanade this weekend to compare the 2, as I've heard this is similar if not the same as the Esplanade, but I like to think that this offers something way more special.   The place is super clean, service is seriously 10/10 -- we had zero issues. The service is also really fast.   Let's talk about the popcorn. My god. It's so so so good and has that perfect nutty crunchiness of freshly made kettle-style (not in flavor just texture) that you love. Comes in a giant silver bowl for $7.95 and is bottomless. You can even leave with a giant bag of it. I feel like they might change that soon since it's such a crazy good deal.  The prices of the food and beverages were good. The ticket was $13.50 so I definitely want to try to go during their happy hour."}
{"text":"Oh RoadHouse Cinemas, what great deals you have! Oh RoadHouse Cinemas, what comfy seats you have! Oh RoadHouse Cinemas, what tasty popcorn you have!  All the better to watch movies, my dear!  We used a Groupon for two that included unlimited popcorn to see Wonder Woman on opening night. We even sat next to someone who was dressed up for the movie complete with tiara, bracelets, and lasso!  The auditorium sizes seem on the smaller side which I really enjoy and the seats were some of the comfiest recliners I have experienced. It feels like you are in someone's fancy living room rather than at a movie theater!   We got Roadhouse's white cheddar popcorn, The Great White. The popcorn was so good I couldn't stop snacking on it! And the portion-size is HUGE! So much so, that we didn't even use the free refill option. You can also order fun movie title foods like: My Big Fat Greek Salad, Sunset Strips Chicken Tenders, Tombstone Burger and Robert Brownie Jr. Sundae.  I really enjoyed myself despite the fact that having servers during a movie can be a little distracting. They do try their best to hunch over and be polite, but I found myself pulled out of the movie once by a rather bright electronic screen one server was carrying to another audience member towards the end of the film during \"last call\".   Ideally, you are probably going to want the seats furthest away from the aisle, in the rows closer to the screen to reduce having servers walk in front of you. But keep in mind if you like to push the call-button then you are responsible for causing the servers to walk in front of other guests.   I will definitely be back to Roadhouse Cinemas again to try their $6 Tuesdays, Way Back Wednesdays (with throwback movies for only $5), and Happy Hour (M-F from 3-6pm), which all sound like a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"Road House Cinemas gets a C when compared to other contemporaries in the area. For the price, its a better value than Ipic at the Quarter, but I'd still pick Studio Movie Grill for the overall experience, particularly the food. I generally take my kids to see a movie and eat. The menu and quality at Road House can use some improving. It also took me over 30 minutes during one our visits along with 2 reminders to get a coffee and popcorn."}
{"text":"CHAOS! This place does not have their stuff together. We get to the theatre at 8:15 for an 8:25 movie and the theatre hasn't even been cleaned yet!!! Not to mention, it looks like they are understaffed. I would rather pay the extra money and just go to iPic. Not to mention once the theatre was cleaned, it wasn't \"cleaned\" there was still popcorn on the floor, tray tables that haven't been wiped down, cups in cup holder. Overall disgusting.i definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"As avid moviegoers, we have really high expectations of the theater, staff members, and food. We hadn't known of this place previously but received a gift card from the holidays so we decided to give it a try.  Well. We were not thrilled with our experience at all.   We went yesterday for the opening wknd of Logan. The movie was going along just fine and then all of a sudden the lights came on. And not just dim yellow soft lighting, but the bright blinding lights that make it hard to see the screen. Ummm there was about 20 minutes of the movie left when this happened. When we asked about this to a staff member we were told management knows about it. Well management, fix it. This is a serious problem. This was opening wknd of a highly anticipated movie.   And while the food tasted amazing (gyro, chicken tenders, beef sandwich, and cheese fries) it was over priced. $11 for a small sandwich and then another $8 for fries. I've got no problem paying for good food, but it's over priced for the quality delivered. Wait staff was nice but service was slow. Save yourself time and money and get dinner before you go."}
{"text":"The air conditioning was not working had I been told it was 80 degrees in the theater I would have never gone in"}
{"text":"Decided to try out the new theatre recently on a Saturday night. We came in last minute about 10 minutes before the movie so the seat selection was very limited. We ended up in the front row but it actually wasn't too bad since the chairs recline. Our server/attendant promptly took our drink order which was just water and we had time to look over the menu. We each ordered the chicken tacos. While these were good they need to work on the corn shell. It was like they took it right out of the package so it was very tough. It needed to be heated up to soften it a bit or change it to a flour tortilla (or give the customer the option of flour or corn). Other than that they were not too bad.   The server had placed our check on our tray table before the end of the movie and he was so quite we didn't even notice! One thing they do, do is charge the debt/credit card you initally use when you purchase your ticket so be aware. Sometimes we will split a move/meals (one will buy dinner one will buy a movie) so I'm not sure how this would work here so I'd suggest asking when you purchase your ticket.   Overall the theatre was very nice and will be back."}
{"text":"Coolest Theater Experience!  This place was found on Groupon and we got a great deal in a 2 person package and thought, why not try it out!  The seating is excellent! Power reclining leather seats! Super cozy!  Staff comes to you with food or drinks while you relax and watch the movie.   The gelato was good, but not quite on the Frost Gelato level of flavor though....  They carry a line of Hess Brewery beers which is an Arizona brewery.   The popcorn is great and super well flavored with the bottomless bowl. However I don't know how you could eat more than 1 bowl since I didn't finish all of ours... lol...  All in all this was the first theater we have gone to in a long time and it's by far the best one so far!"}
{"text":"Love the renovations at the Roadhouse.  Great service and comfy recliners.  Look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Omg!! I can't believe I haven't left a review here yet! I thought I did a while ago.  I just LOVE this place! I'll even go just to dine in. It's the best movie experience ever! This place has ruined me and my family for other movie theaters - we are spoiled!  When you walk in, its like a western saloon theme. The decor is just beautifully done. You can tell a lot of thought, heart, and soul was put into this. You are greeted with a large bar, should you desire a drink well before the movie. I should add that they have a wonderful happy hour with half off drinks and munchies.  Anyway, there's another counter that you can view sweet treats/gelato (all of which is also available at your seat in the theater) and a window showcasing fancy desserts.  You make your way to your theater to your assigned seats which are these amazing, plush recliner chairs. I should say that they are more of a couple type of seating. So the menu - they have a menu with a great selection of foods and drinks from pizza to sandwiches and pasta dishes. Feel free to choose coffee or perhaps a beer or cocktail.  Appetizers come on time, before your meal, unlike other theaters (ahem, Studio Movie Grill). They always get orders correct and the food is good. The servers are excellent and attentive which is hard to find at dine in theaters (take note Studio Movie Grill).   Things I enjoy: nachos,  pulled pork sandwich, and cheeseburgers.  If you start coming here, you won't go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my Movie here. Service was good, popcorn was great. The atmosphere is what is worth reviewing. The theaters are small and intimate, seats are luxurious and automatic. Swivel trays with cup holder. Great experience. Good food drinks, fat price."}
{"text":"We've been there twice this month. Have no complaints. Both times service was excellent. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I seldom take to the internet to give a negative review to a local business, but I'll make an exception for Roadhouse Cinemas.  The seats are comfortable, I'll grant you that.  And I did love the recliner feature that allowed me to put my feet up.  However, the sound was so loud it was almost deafening.  The prices are a significant bump above our usual Harkins Theater and even Studio Movie Grill, which also has comfy seats and food service.  But the service was horrible!  A bevy of wait staff rush around before the show begins, take your credit card imprint, and promise free refills on drinks and popcorn.  However an hour into the movie we still hadn't received the popcorn we ordered.  We buzzed for our waiter, who appeared and promised popcorn, but never showed again.  My husband missed part of the movie to go out to the serving area to buy popcorn, and then when we got the bill we were charged for the popcorn we never received.  We're waiting to see if there is a problem with the credit card statement. . . .   Next time we'll save the money, skip the hassle, and see the movie."}
{"text":"Very nice, but I didn't care for the popcorn. It was white, and I prefer yellow. They had flavors like caramel and jalapeño, but the basic buttered popcorn was weak, and because of that I won't be back. The theatre itself is spacious and comfortable. They have many options for food and drink. Employees were nice."}
{"text":"Last night was my second time here but my first time ordering food from here. Got a gift card a few months ago and was excited to come try it out! This is such a nice theater, I love it. We bought our tickets last minute and first row was our only option, it wasn't bad at all though! The reclining chairs are amazing. For our food we shared the appetizer platter, I think called the road trip? It was a nice way to try a little bit of everything. Our favorite part was the soft pretzel and cheese. The fries were ok, the quesadilla was yummy!  My only reason for taking a star away was the service. I'm usually easy to please when it comes to service but we both noticed our server seemed grumpy and annoyed with us. First we asked if we could swap out something else for the chicken tenders (I'm a vegetarian), she didn't say no or yes just kinda seemed mad that we'd even ask so we said nevermind because my boyfriend could eat them. Then I asked if they could put the chicken tenders on a separate plate for us and she basically said no and served it all on the same plate. Not the biggest deal ever, I just feel like that's not much to ask to just have the chicken on a different plate and they wouldn't accommodate. Otherwise a great time though and I'd love to come back."}
{"text":"The worst place to see a movie if u are a non-eater. We couldn't enjoy the movie because half the people were making so much noise. They were burping and farting. Scraping their plates. Slurping and hiccuping. And u pay more!! Who needs this???"}
{"text":"So here's the deal. Atmosphere was fun, seats were really comfy, price for the tickets and food were reasonable, however you can tell the management is poor. This place was just remodeled and it is dirty. The floors were dirty, bathroom smelled like urine, the bathroom countertops were wet, the hand towel dispensers were both empty. While the wait staff was really friendly, we waited for 7 min. after the movie was over for someone to even take our credit card. We weren't the only ones either. There were 5 more couples waiting as well. I will go back but I'll wait a few months for them to get their act together."}
{"text":"Was awesome experience. And I am  ipic person. The food and service and the comfortable chairs blow ipic out of the water. Will go back. Oh yea. The PRICE."}
{"text":"This is the second or third theatre that's been in this place and finally someone has got it right!  As you walk in the bar is right up front and the ticket windows are off to the left.  The bar has a nice selection of craft beer, wine and spirits.  I chose my seat and walked down the long hallway to my theatre.  Most of the seating is set up for couples with armrests that fold up or down.  The thing I like the most about the leather seats is that even fully reclined there is plenty of room for the servers or other guests to walk in front of you.  However, good forbid you have to use the restroom during the movie.  Depending on what theatre you're in, it can be a looooong walk down and back."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to check out a movie, a tad slow on bringing what you order but hard to beat the prices during happy hour! Love the reclining seats!"}
{"text":"NOT impressed. Or maybe I just had super high expectations, as its in fufu Scottsdale. Came here on a groupon, since it was a smoking deal. Mind you, living downtown, we have a dine in theater on Camelback much closer. Thought I would give this place a try though just for the hell of it. Took the kiddo to see Cars 3. I will say, the actual theater itself is gorgeous. Nicely decorated, very clean. The seats get 5 starts. Very comfortable. The service though was horrific. Just terrible. The poor woman next to me (who I didn't come with) had to ask the girl 3 times for her sprite. This was a daytime movie showing it was NOT packed. THEN (the same waitress) told me that for part of the groupon (2 beers or 2 sodas included) that it had to be the same drink I couldn't do 1 beer and 1 soda. WHAT THE HELL. I said okay my 8 year old will take a beer then. What kind of rule is that, is it not common to have a minor with you at a movie theater? AND on top of that, I would think your cost for soda is MUCH cheaper than the fancy beers you serve. Needless to say, my child got gipped of his soda (sorry lol) and I got the 2 beers. I got 2 different kinds, don't ask me what ones. Both were good. The popcorn was ice cold. Didn't even bother complaining. It was just not a good experience. The groupon was a great deal, but I would not come back without one even if I was in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We've tried every dine in theatre in the phoenix area and this is our top choice! Good food, comfy seats, clean theatre and great service!"}
{"text":"Came by on Monday night to see how this place compares to all of the other dinner and a movie places in the valley.   Pros: really solid happy hour prices on drinks and appetizers Super friendly and attentive staff Comfortable seating - each seat includes a tray, multiple cup holders, napkins and condiments)  Beautiful atmosphere  Free refill on popcorn and soda  Cons: the movie times listed on their website are not correct. Be careful! We were lucky and ended up being early for our movie as opposed to missing it Food is fine. We paid happy hour price but it is def not worth the full price We ordered the standard popcorn which comes with butter. The popcorn was really soggy from the butter and it kind of grossed me out a bit :/  All in all we had a nice experience. It didn't blow me out of the water like iPic did, but I found the atmosphere more comfortable than harkins camelview. Would def come back for the $6 Tuesday's."}
{"text":"Seeing movies in the 21st century equals comfy seats, gourmet treats & booze. Whoever started that trend, thank you. We all thank you. The decor of this place is super cute and the overall atmosphere is great. We got there early to eat and drink prior to the show. The bar had a awesome selection of local beer on tap- score! The bartenders were busy and service was somewhat slow but they were super friendly. The menu is full of punny names for food items. We tried the road trip for two appetizer and the cool hand Luke salad. The appetizer was nothing spectacular but I enjoy the salad.  The highlight of the food was what we had in the theater which is served by a server when you put on a service light. The popcorn was amazing. They have fun favors to mix and match. The bowl is endless but I don't think you would ever need a refill. We also tried the mint chocolate chip gelato. Yum!  The seats are assigned. (you pick the seat at time of purchase based on availability) they are good sized brown automatic recliners with a moveable tray table. Unfortunately the tray table over my seat was not movable and stuck over the seat which made it somewhat difficult to get in and out of the chair.  I would pick this place over the updated AMC and Harkins theaters because of the popcorn and cheaper alcohol prices. The future of going to the movies is swell."}
{"text":"We frequent the car show at the Pavillions and usually like to grab a bite to eat while there.  A friend informed me this wasn't just a cinema and you can just go in for dinner.  The dining room is a decent size and the bar has lots of choices including craft beer.  Not the biggest menu you'll find but enough variety to suit most tastes. Then you also can have all the cinema regulars like candy and popcorn.   They also serve gelato which was needed in this shopping center. I had their Tombstone burger which had great flavor but they will only cook it medium well, and not medium.  They do charge extra for fries but the fries were really good and come with a spicy dipping sauce.  One additional negative is they have ribs on the menu but when a friend ordered them he was served tiny pieces of meat and not actual ribs so the menu listing is not accurate.  If judged by their food alone I would rate it a 3, but because of their choices and the great job our waiter did taking care of us they earned the extra star."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but the service has gone downhill.  We had to ask three times where our popcorn and drinks were then was told they threw away the popcorn because it was so late.  We were first to arrive, first to order and last to be served.  I have recommended Roadhouse to several people plus go at least three or four times a month, possibly more yet the last few times the customer service has been horrible.  Food coming out and finished before even getting drinks, waiting in line to get tickets while employees are just standing there watching you wait since it's \"not their job,\" employees talking and laughing about customers, having to wait over 15 minutes after call button was on just to wait another 15 on a slow night to get a water....... With more and more places changing to the same concept, it is going to be difficult to keep customers with this continued service.  I'm not sure if it's worth going back although it is comfortable and when we do get popcorn, it is the best!!"}
{"text":"I went to see the new Independence Day movie here and 20 minutes in the audio cut out so that all of the people's voices were very quiet and slightly higher pitched. When we asked the server about the audio all she said was that other people complained, we can't do anything more and you can talk to manager later. On top of all this the screen had a visible mark on it. The service was also very poor and we waited way too long for drinks. My recommendation if you want a dine in movie, go to studio movie grill."}
{"text":"Was taken care of by Simon who worked in concessions. Excellent man and had a beautiful time at the cinema. Thank you for a great time and wonderful service."}
{"text":"I waited til a second visit before writing the rave review. Finally a theatre that gets it. When you go to the movies, it's not just about the movie but the entire experience. With that said...  The overall look if this theatre was well done. Western decor and a great feel. 5 stars  The cleanliness was outstanding. I have to say your competitors need to buy a ticket and watch a movie and learn from you. Spotless every time. No garbage in my cup holder or on the floor by my feet. I cant say the same with other \"luxury\" theatres. Keep up the cleaning routine at your establishment..it shows. 5 stars  The drinks.. this might be my only mild negative critique. It was a little strong and if if wasnt ..i might have ordered a second. (Mudslide)  4 stars  The food that your serving is excellent.. also your pricing is fair.  I like the spin on the popcorns. 5 stars  We will continue to drive the extra 20mins and give you business. Just keep your standards high! Thank you."}
{"text":"Beautiful space. Very grand and impressive walking through the front doors.   This was our first visit and I feel that this building and concept deserve a better execution.   I agree with previous posts with regard to the cleanliness.  There was trash everywhere.  I sat waiting for my daughter in the restroom and watched half a dozen employees walk by trash on the floor without picking it up. They stood and chatted, but didn't seem to care about cleaning.   Our seats had popcorn on them and my table had a sticky spilled substance on it.  We went to a Saturday matinee. I can't imagine what this placed looked like before the saturday evening rush.   While the servers were super friendly, the actual service was off. We finished our food before we received our drinks.  Didn't receive out popcorn until half way thru the movie.   Black bean burger and iced tea were great. Enjoyed the flavor of the popcorn, it was fresh.  But, it was overshadowed by a business that was dirty. It was kind of scary eating food in the dark wondering how filthy the kitchen was..."}
{"text":"This place rocks. Dinner and a movie has never been this good.  I love the napkins and condiment between the seats. Full bar and food is great."}
{"text":"The best theater in south Scottsdale! Great food, amazing seats, always clean and easy parking! Not much more to ask for!"}
{"text":"Serious questions for the owners, as I think everyone eating here (especially me!) deserves to know that what they and their kids are eating is safe for consumption: 1. How do you control for food-borne illness? 2. What independent regulatory body monitors your policies and procedures for the health and safety of your customers? 3. Does this independent body conduct regular surprise inspections? 4. Where can I find the results of inspections, recommendations and/or health grades for your establishment?"}
{"text":"Horribly expensive. Jurassic Park movie with my family and the service was horrible. We had our waiter buttons on forever and they never came. Finally I had to get up to find someone. Only to see seven waiters standing BSing in the hall. I asked for our waitress and they said they couldn't find her. When she finally came she was super rude and started arguing with me about how long we waited.   I would avoid. If not for service then why would you go? Right?"}
{"text":"It's an inexpensive dine-in movie option, but you get what you pay for. Our drink at the bar before the movie was good. We then went into the theater to sit down, and ordered popcorn, drinks, and dinner 10 minutes before the movie started. The waters came immediately, which was a blessing, because the wait for the rest was unbearable. Had to push the button to not only ask where our drinks were, but halfway through the movie, our food still wasn't there, and had to summon the server to find out where our food was. No explanation, no apology.   The place boasts of making all of their food from scratch, but I absolutely do not believe it. My wife's fish tacos were horrible, and my burger was barely edible.   The best part of this place is the popcorn. It's bottomless and delicious. The bar and the popcorn are the only reason this place even got 2 stars."}
{"text":"The seating is nice, but the service is hit or miss at best.  It seems like depending on where you've been assigned to sit - you may or may not be serviced.    First visit was amazing.  Second visit was horrible.    No refills on drinks or popcorn.  Very unhelpful even when the signal light was illuminated.  If it wasn't for the Groupon deal...we wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I really like this new  cinema and the food is actually very tasty. The people are nice and the movies first run."}
{"text":"This is the second or third time I have gone to Roadhouse and they were out of a lot of items for snacks and desserts. And the popcorn which is usually really good was not fresh had no butter on it. Very disappointed. I go here A LOT!"}
{"text":"They were 5 stars at one time!!! Not sure what has happened, but they are becoming very sloppy, inconsistent and customer service is at an all time low. Disappointed. Will go back to AMC"}
{"text":"Food was good, could have been better. We ordered two of the platters for two on the happy hour special. Pricing was fair on the happy hour munchies, but don't know why popcorn runs the same price as a huge platter of food! It seems insane to pay the same price for popcorn as you do chicken fingers, quesadilla, fries and soft pretzels. I would love to see popcorn added to the happy hour menu. The one issue with the platters was the lack of sauce. The one came with sour cream, salsa and cheese sauce and the other came with salsa, cheese sauce and ranch.   I think they either shorted us ranch on one or sour cream on one since they were the same item (we didn't realize until after the server left and the movie was already going so we just made due). Needless to say without ranch dressing the chicken fingers were a little dry (but lots of chicken breast meat). I would honestly love to see even two packs of ranch on each platter because it was so good. The cheese sauce for the soft pretzel was amazing, I think the soft pretzel was my favorite, the chicken fingers probably would have been if it wasn't for the lack of sauce. The quesadillas were okay, a little cool by the time they came so not as good as they could have been. The fries were solid.   Drinks were reasonable at happy hour, and seems crazy a beer is nearly the same price as an Italian soda! Seats were comfortable, but should be cleaned between viewings as I had to wipe some oil off mine (assigned seats and all). Server was nice, wait for food was a little long, at least you have something to watch on the screen.  My biggest pet peeve would be the volume of the movie, it was a little too loud and some parts were just plain obnoxious. I think if they lowered the volume even 20% it would be perfect. I'm concerned the volume is close to almost causing hearing damage (yes it was that loud).   More ranch dressing, clean seats the first time, hot quesadillas, happy hour popcorn and slightly lower volume and this place would get a 5 star from me.  Update: Did a follow up visit for July 4th. They ran their Tuesday deal in spite of the holiday which was decent, service was still good, seats cleaner this time, volume just right.   On my way out, I witnessed an employee slamming doors and screaming at staff in the kitchen - this is totally not ok, nor professional. The women's bathroom happens to back on to the doors to the kitchen. Not a great last impression leaving the place."}
{"text":"This place is so great! Good food, awesome drinks, comfortable seats and first-run (current) movies? Yes, please! Plus, $6 Tuesdays, yay! All movies are $6 all day!"}
{"text":"Tonite I say for the first time roadhouse has failed. I walked in. Got my ticket. Sat at a table ...after 5 min I got my drink... wanted to ride food... guy never came back. Sat there half an hour. Turned my ticket in an left.  What has happened to this theatre?  Plus the parking sucks on sat bites cause of all the asshole car show people"}
{"text":"We went again last night to see Atomic Blond....it was so loud I could not stand it. I turned on my decimal reader app and was astounded.  Most of the movie was well into 70 - 90 decimal range ...way to loud.  The theatre has lights on all over the place so that the film reflects the fixtures and the black tones are more like grey tones. So, shitty sound and ruined cinematography  I already mentioned bad service. Now I must add terrible sound control...lighting, and the manager? When I complained she did nothing. She has ears.  I saw them on her head... Did she think I was complaining for fun?  It was painful. I had wadded up napkins in my ears the whole time.  I told hubby we're done with that theatre, he agrees. Hotter than hades. fried shitty food, slow service , lights on,  the theatre was empty.  They deserve no business.  The food is not good.  I take back what I said earlier. If you want to weigh 1,000 pounds it's okay...pure junk."}
{"text":"This movie theater has the best seats and food. What is great about the food is has choices unlike most movie theaters salads, pitas, fish and all so yummy. They also have different popcorn varieties!!! I tell everyone about this movie theater, it's deffianly a hidden gem Tuesday it's $6 for tickets!!"}
{"text":"My Husband and I come here every other Tuesday for a movie, happy hour and We are normally over impressed with the service and value. Last time we ordered popcorn and drink in the theater, we waited and waited, then found our waitress standing outside our movie movie on her phone \" oh, did you want your popcorn\"?....duh, do I need to get it myself? Tonight my 6 oz wine pour was 4 oz and the road trip for 2 was more like a road trip for 1 and we waited 45 minutes. What's up?"}
{"text":"Ugh.  Theaters are way too warm, and the sound was awful.  The food - what a mess - some burnt, some under-seasoned, and not worth the value."}
{"text":"The best theater I the seats there and food service there was great I will do that and I love you so I next time I visit Arizona that will fun."}
{"text":"Totally a great experience! Something different and amazing! They had a full menu with meals, munchies, popcorn, ice cream.... And very reasonably priced! You will never want to go to a regular theater again!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite movie theater in Arizona until last night. We went to dinner and a movie and my husband's wallet was stolen from the arm of his seat. We have NO DOUBT it was an employee, and we feel we know which one. We talked to the manager who talked to the employees and all said they didn't know anything about it...of course. The manager then checked the security cameras and saw nothing. Because we are not allowed to view their security camera film, he said, \"Feel free to call the police. They check our security cameras all the time.\"  All the time?  ALL THE TIME???? How often does this happen? I think quite a bit. We called the police, who were wonderful. They checked the security cameras and couldn't see anything either. Funny...dark corner of a dark theater, and the security cameras were inconclusive... While we sat in the lobby for 2 hours through all of this, we saw probably 10 people during that time come out of their theaters and complain to management that they were over-charged on their food bill. This has also happened to us on occasion. I think this place is a scam and has an underlying problem of thievery and dishonesty. We will never set foot in that theater again. I strongly warn you to stay away, but if you go, watch your belongings and CHECK YOUR BILL BEFORE PAYING!!!"}
{"text":"This is our second time to visit Roadhouse. What a great concept for a theater! You can reserve your seats online ahead of time, so no rush to get a good seat. My favorite part? They have $6 movies all day on Tuesday, and then happy hour from 3-6 M-F! The seats are true recliners and so comfy! And the popcorn  truly delicious. I've read some negative comments about the service, but honestly, everyone's experience is going to unique. I've personally been impressed with the bartenders and servers. This place is my new favorite Tuesday afternoon activity!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great food especially the jalapeño White Popcorn! Quick service with reasonable pricing! Roadhouse Cinema will definitely be our families new go to for movies!"}
{"text":"I've been to several different luxury theaters, this one is by far the best! Not quite as opulent as the Ipic in N. Scottsdale, but at almost a third the price, I'm ok with that. The food is really good too. Not too shi-shi like the Ipic, but way better than other theaters, on par (price and quality wise) with most family style restaurants.  Come early (or stay later) to hang out at the bar in the lobby. Mike pours a good drink, is helpful and friendly, and good company to chat with while you wait. I feel a little sorry for him though. I watch the tickets come in for drinks, he makes them asap, and then they die on the counter waiting for the short-handed staff to deliver them to people in the theater whom I can only assume are wasting away from thirst! Word to the wise: order your drinks early or just go out and get them directly from the bar. Another recommendation, order the grapefruit Mule and tell Mike the lady with the blond and blue hair said hi!"}
{"text":"Great movie theatre! The seating was so comfortable, surround sound was amazing! The food was awesome. The waiting service is fast and efficient--there is no distraction while watching the movie. We absolutely loved it! We are never going to another theatre besides this one!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great menu great service and the prices are very reasonable compared to places like IPic. Our new favorite date night spot"}
{"text":"Highlights:  -Jalapeño popcorn is so good  -Had the spicy burger which was huge and awesome. Better quality than red robin.  -soft pretzels was awesome -get your fries loaded!!! - staff was friendly even with the chaos of the open I'll be back when they are running current movies!"}
{"text":"Rave review for roadhouse cinema for the amazing past 3 hours of my life. From start to finish, I have nothing but good things to say. From the great and prompt food/drinks to the friendly and attentive service to the comfortable and inviting accommodations. This place is a home run and I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"My partner and I have been here more than a few times. What brings us back is the popcorn/seats and the great customer service from every employee. We visited yesterday 9/17/17 to watch IT the movie. We enjoyed the pizza and Buffalo Soldiers, both delicious. This morning, and lasting all day, we are both sick. Food Poisoning!!! Not cool, roadhouse Cinemas!! Not cool! I'm giving the employees and the ambience of this place a 4 star, but food wise I would give you 1 star."}
{"text":"We really enjoy this place! Great prices, good food, comfy seating and awesome movies! The staff are always friendly and attentive :)"}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite movie theater. We always watch movies here because their is free popcorn for a whole year if you buy a t-shirt. They also have an extensive menu of all tasty snacks and meals. The seats in the movie theater recline and have tons of space for food. My favorite thing to order is their great gelato."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical before going. Figure it was going to be over priced like the other movie theaters here.   We went, instantly welcomed with loud hellos and big smiles! I was blown away by the ticket prices, then we ordered drinks, then food that was delivered to our comfortable reclining seats! Then we got the freshly cooked amazing food! The best part was the drinks kept coming and when I got the bill I realized I would be going back just for happy hour!   It wasn't packed, our hostess was so nice and prompt!   I will never go to another movie theater and now look forward to going out to the movies!! I haven't been on a Wednesday yet. But I heard it was $4 movie night!   Best place in town"}
{"text":"The happy hour is such a good deal.   Seats are ultra comfortable and sound impeccable.   Very nice servers and theater staff.  One Trump hater bartender who speaks with a raspy voice was irritating but him and his ignorance spoke only for himself."}
{"text":"I love RoadHouse Cinemas. Ive been there now about 13 times in the last 3 months and not once have I been let down (other than by bad movies lol). The staff are excellent, friendly, and go above and beyond to make our stay awesome on every visit.  Every time we arrive to check out another movie we feel like part of the family. We look forward to another trip to the RoadHouse Cinema in a few more days. My favorite Cinema on the planet!"}
{"text":"As first timers, my friend & I came on Saturday night & planned on sitting at the bar for a couple of hours until our showtime. After at least 10 min of not being acknowledged (it was not a busy bar) I was ready to wave my hand & call for attention when two couples approached the bar beside us and the bartender immediately went over & took their order. I looked at the bar tender & said \"are you serous??\"  He still did not acknowledge nor look at us. Terrible service. Good popcorn though."}
{"text":"Hands down the best theatre/dining experience in the valley. Service was great. Food and drinks were delicious. Love the ambiance. If you haven't been to this one, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"I totally love this place!!! Clean, nice employees, service at your reclining seats, very well priced, and cute themed cinema..."}
{"text":"We saw Rampage here tonight... great movie. But the theater. Great service. I've never even heard of this place but were at the car show and stopped in! Very good surprise. Great service, reclining seats, service at your seat, free recipe on popcorn and drinks! The guys said food was good but I had gelato and oh my best ever. I reccomend. And our service was amazing Austin was out server. Great name lol but amazing service!"}
{"text":"I drive 6.5 hours from Orange County to go to this theater! The seats are comfy, the screens are perfect size, the food is delicious and the service is awesome and all for an amazing price can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Decided to take my family from out of town to this theater so we bought 3 tickets ahead of time on their online site. I did not receive the tickets in my email but I DID get charged for the 3 tickets so I called the theater to tell them I was charged but still had not received the tickets... The woman on the phone claimed the only way they could tell was if I came to the theater and they swiped my card... They couldn't pull it up with my first or last name OR take the card over the phone to see if the card number would show up. I was upset because I didn't want to drive 40 minutes away to see that it didn't work and that we lost our seats. The next movie wasn't showing until really late. Which WAS THE WHOLE POINT I BOUGHT THEM AHEAD OF TIME because I knew it would fill up quick. So my family and I drove there anyway hoping that it worked and sure enough they said my card wasn't on file.. Once again, IT CHARGED MY ACCOUNT! They said that their website has been having glitches and that they were very sorry and to call my bank and discuss the charge.. I then spoke to a co-worker who had the EXACT same problem and still hasn't gotten her money refunded. I will NOT be returning to this theater. They need figure out how to pull up people by their first and last name, OR better yet get their website fixed... If you do go to this theater DON'T buy them through their website!!"}
{"text":"Now this is the way to watch a movie.  Drinks, food awesome lounging seats.  Roadhouse knows what's up.  The fact that this place isn't 5 stars absolutely boggles me.  Came here tonight and they had live music in the lobby.  The bartenders were also super friendly.  Take my word for it people, this is the ultimate movie experience. P.S did I mention they have happy hour? Yep."}
{"text":"Great theater!  Love the reclining seats and semi private rows.  It gives you plenty of space to stretch out and relax while watching the movie.  Had the white cheddar popcorn and a root beer, both were very tasty!  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"So Bad!!! This place went downhill. Came to see a movie last night at 10:35. At 10:25 no one even realized the place needed to be cleaned. Finally after asking the sent 2 people to clean. We are still waiting and the previews start. Asked to speak with a manager who had one excuse after the next. Offered to pay for popcorn and drinks yet the bill came and the manager was nowhere to be found. Super disappointing. Enjoyed having a place like this near by. Not any more!"}
{"text":"I'd give this place a minus 5 if I could. So Fandango showed a 1:45 showing.  We arrived to be told there was no showing. Next movie at 4:30.. 6/17/17 at 13:45. We showed the woman the fandango showing. She torted in a snarky rude manner, \"You should've gone to the Roadhouse website. We're not affiliated with Fandango\". I told her that didn't even make sense and but everyone uses Fandango, she interrupted me saying, \"Not everyone.\"  I stated ALOT of people use it and she said \"Maybe you should call Fandango\". I was like \"Wow\"!  So rude!!! I'll NEVER go there again. So rude... wow."}
{"text":"Okay, so I had a better experience this time. Service was really fast and the food was good (Got the pretzel with cheese- how can you go wrong!) Staff was friendly and helpful. I was asked if I needed anything in the hallway to the movie which was curteous of them to do. A week later, I went to a late night showing of Arrival, (saw the times online) only to have someone behind the bar tell me and a couple in front of me that they weren't showing anymore movies that night. Not sure what the mishap was all about but it's right down the street from me so it wasn't really out of my way. I'm keeping it 4 stars because I had a good experience but heads up to management- times online need to mirror times in the theater box office. Thats a bad yelp review waiting to happen folks"}
{"text":"I really like RoadHouse cinemas. The prices are very competitive when comparing them to Old Town Scottsdale cinemas. Their HH prices are great: half-off after 3pm. There is no internet service, but I think this is a good thing considering the venue."}
{"text":"I am in awe that this place is still in business. Have a question? Good luck getting a live person on the phone. I've tried calling the number advertised on Google and the website and the number goes to a voice message saying you reached the wrong extension. Want to purchases eight tickets in advance for your party or group? This place does not sell tickets in advance like AMC, Harkins, or iPic. If you try calling and by some miracle receive a person, they can never tell you for sure when tickets will go on sale or what times. Sometimes for blockbusters, the showtime will be around 7 or around 10p.m., and maybe it will be around 8 p.m.  It's a surprise every time!   Once after trying three times to get a live person to see Spider Man Homecoming, I was told that the tickets will go on sale a week before opening night  (all other major theatres had went on sale a month before). The sale date from Roadhouse was a lie. AMC got my business instead.   The food is mediocre and the portions are small. Pricing is the same as most dine-in movie theatres.   All in all, I will only come to this theatre if I have to or do not need to purchase several tickets for my group. So frustrating."}
{"text":"We hoped for a much better experience then we received.  arrived 30mins ahead of the movie as asked and ordered our dinner as well as two drinks and the bottomless popcorn.  The dinner arrived fast and was good however nothing to drink and no popcorn.  30 mins & 4 button pushes later, getting out of my seat and asking were our drinks and popcorn were and then being promised we'll get it right to you they finally brought my wives drink and not mine.  20 mins later mine arrives.  6 more button pushes and 40 more mins with the server showing up each time and saying it isn't here yet?  we finally get some popcorn.  Of Course the movie is almost over. They seem to have no tracking or accounting for anyone's order or what has or hasn't arrived.  I would have enjoy a drink with my meal let alone couldn't even get my refill that was asked for.  The popcorn was terrible and kept me up all night with stomach problems.  I think they must have gotten me the bottom of the barrel or something because they messed up so much and just brought me what was left. Do they clean the popping container ever. Was sick until 9am the next morning when it wore off.  Felt great until eating that 75 min later popcorn.     I think I'll go to other places where I can enjoy a movie and not be getting up and down to find out where my meal is.  I would rather stand in line and get it then have to wait forever and keep getting \"can I help you\" \"oh you haven't gotten it yet, I'll bring it out\"    Really sucks to watch your entire row get seconds and you not even get one drink."}
{"text":"Wow! Such a fun place to watch a movie at. Really impressed with their theater for a great reasonable price. Also really loved the food, I ordered the dos shrimp tacos which was very good and their fries was awesome too as well! Only thing that annoyed us, was our waiter forgot one order and he forgot to split our check. At the end of it all, he did apologized and admitted fault right away, which i absolutely have respect for. I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Went to redeem my free popcorn coupon last night with my husband and AS ALWAYS, had a relaxing, above average time! We sat in the bar/restaurant area towards the end of the night and watched the sports games. Everything was clean and fresh. I just need to give a shoutout to Alex, behind the popcorn counter because he is ALWAYS fun, professional, and friendly. He knows his role at Roadhouse inside and out and has impeccable customer service skills. We look forward to running into him when we visit. Thanks to Roadhouse for having him on the team!"}
{"text":"I've been excited for this to open but didn't realize we were going to opening night when we purchased our tickets. They had a band playing outside and a good amount of people having a drink at the bar. We joined them for a drink before our movie. The drinks and food are affordable. The theater itself was awesome. I like it way better than Studio Movie Grill because there isn't a row of people right in front of you, which is less distracting. The seats fully recline and are super comfortable. Food was good, great service. We have found our new favorite movie theater!"}
{"text":"I am SUPER impressed with this place. Everyone is extra friendly and helpful, greeting you throughout your visit. The waiters that come to your seats are knowledgeable, friendly and thorough. The food is surprisingly good, Being a movie theater, I wasn't expecting much, but they do an excellent job with what I would describe as upscale bar food. As for the theater itself, the theater seats are very comfortable, like big recliners with electric controls. Projection and sound were great, and the ticket prices were the same as surrounding \"normal\" theaters.  We liked it so much we went back to see another movie a couple days later, to try some other menu items. The soft pretzel was delicious! We'll definitely be back, often.  I hope they continue their high level of service and food quality.  One tip - the recliner seats are more or less grouped in pairs. On the website, it's not clear which seats are together."}
{"text":"Always a fun time! Great service at the bar before the movie began - both bartenders were very energetic and talkative. Popcorn always hits the spot, too - especially the different variations. If you're looking for a relaxing time with a movie and a meal, this is definitely the place for you!"}
{"text":"Roadhouse is my favorite movie place to go to. I love the food, seats, and the $6 movie Tuesdays. There is nothing better then some jalapeno popcorn and a good movie! You need to go there!"}
{"text":"Ordered food, told server I'd pay cash he insisted I secure with credit card so I did, at end of show he gave me bill, I told him I'm paying cash he said ok....left a nice tip and 2 days later credit card was charged. Called theater asked to speak to general manager she has yet to return call.....DO NOT PAY CASH or SECURE WITH CREDIT CARD....rip off!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night.  A quick check in process, given we prepurchased tickets online.  A cool lil bar area, that we will probably try the next time.  We got to out seats, which were comfortable and convenient.  We liked the separate tables, and center armrest that folds up.  The food was good.  We got a burger and fries, as well as chicken strips.  We had to ask for ranch 2-3 times, which kinda sucked.  The chicken was cold by the time we got the ranch.  All in all, a good experience.  A much better value than Ipic in N. Scottsdale.  We will be back."}
{"text":"RoadHouse Cinemas is the place to be if you like recliner seats, large variety of food selections, and great service! If not, try your local dollar theater. But here at RoadHouse, you will find several amazing flavors of popcorn that are non-GMO. The burgers and shareables are very good and will definitely keep you satisfied while watching your movie. I would recommend getting your tickets early because in my experience they do sell out quickly, especially on Tuesdays for $6 movies. It's a good date night and is very reasonable as far as pricing."}
{"text":"The theaters are nice, and the seats are as comfy as they come, but expect it to take more than half a movie to get something as simple as a popcorn and iced tea.  Great space, but incredibly mismanaged."}
{"text":"The first RoadHouse Cinemas I visited was in Tucson. I actually had no idea they had a location in Phoenix! When I realized we could go to one in Scottsdale it was a huge relief. I had been looking for a more upscale movie theater where you can drink beer, grab a bite, recline your seat and not be around teenagers. I must be getting old!  We have now been here multiple times and it is our go-to movie theater. We always get our tickets a day or two in advance, and grab a beer beforehand. The food is pretty decent - portions can be small for the price, but it's a whole experience and I wouldn't expect it to be cheap. Try the flatbread and the jalapeño popcorn! But prepared to eat in the pitch dark, which can be challenging. Because of that, I'm thinking I might start eating elsewhere and just getting a drink or popcorn during the movie, but I will still come here for date nights because the overall experience is always positive.  Normal movie theaters are old news. I can't fathom going back to that and spending the same amount of money for a bad seat and loud people surrounding me. RoadHouse is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Went here with my friends yesterday. WOW! I'm not a fan of dine in cinemas as my experiences with places like Studio Movie Grill haven't been the best. So we went on $6 Tuesdays (awesome!) but we got stuck in traffic and I was thinking the $6 program would end at 6 PM as other theaters have matinee showings and the tickets go up in price. Nope! $6 for a movie at 8 PM! So far so good, went into the theater and sat down. The chairs were leather and reclined with the push of a button. They also had trays that swiveled for your food right over the chairs. The ones at SMG have tables and it's just not relaxing while watching a movie. This was different. I ordered their soft pretzel twists with cheese dip and a chocolate shake, the healthiest thing ever of course, and the server got it out to me super fast and they were very friendly! I pushed the recliner back and drank my shake as I watched Annabelle. The surround sound in these theaters is fantastic! Almost like something out of Universal Studios. It sounded like I was actually there! Gave a lot more effect to the movie itself. Overall, LOVE this theater. Food was moderately priced and the $6 Ticket Tuesday is just great! Will return to this movie theater!"}
{"text":"This is a luxurious movie theater. We always come here when a new movie comes out. The chairs lean back and there is a foot rest. The service is great, and when you ask for a drink, it's a big cup, so you gets lots of it. Their popcorn is healthy, and delicious. Don't eat too much of the popcorn though, because my daughter and I did, and we went out to eat, and we could barely eat because our stomachs hurt from eating too much."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST movie experience in Scottsdale & Phoenix.  Excellent food and service. Very spacious. Exceptionally crafted food and desserts with full wine, beer & liquor delivered right to your seat.  Homemade ice cream!!  Buy your tickets and pick your seats online or using their app.  I was a fan of Harkins for 20+ years. Now I won't even see a movie at a Harkins.  Night and day difference.  A++"}
{"text":"First time here!! They are really on top of it. Outstanding service. Food is amazing. Not over priced. Just wish the popcorn was hotter. It was kinda cold. We ate like fat kids that night. Chairs are reclining. Going back next week!"}
{"text":"I really want to give this five stars, this place is really awesome. Seriously, don't waste your money on harkins camelview when you can get the same seats here for a better price. But when it comes down to it, you're seeing a movie and the movie quality should be amazing. We'll be back, and hopefully they'll amp up their projector/sound system.  The food: 10/10 amazing selection and quality. Blows studio move grill and harkins camelview out of the water.   Ambience: Very Alamo Drafthouse like, pretty decor, and nice flow. The bathroom doors are a bit weird to open. The seats are like the ones at the Harkins camelview. Everything is pristine, and thoughtful. The staff is super friendly, like, Dutch brothers level.   Movie: No previews which feels strange. The blacks on the projector need to be calibrated. Really dark scenes, the blacks were almost blue (theater 10). Also, the projector in general was dark, as evidence by things that should've been bright white looked dimmed or blueish. Most people probably wouldn't notice-but working as a video editor, it's something that I found distracting. The sound was quiet in volume, and is not surround sound. When you see a movie, especially an action movie, I love to experience great sound and feel the booming bass. This theater does not have that. While the screen is large and the seats are good, the general movie experience was just okay.   So to sum it up, I really really loved roadhouse cinema but was disappointed in the sound and video quality. However, with such an overly friendly awesome staff, and potential, I have no doubt that they'll end up upping their video and sound quality."}
{"text":"The service here is absolutely horrid. The past two times our movie experience has been completely ruined by the poor, rude, and slow service that we have had to re watch the movie at another theater. The drinks are over priced, $22 for a Tito's double with club soda but alas they gave me a well and sprite and when I put the call button on it took 22 minuets for someone to come, 30 more minuets for them to bring a new drink and by then I was about ready to dump it on the rude girls head when I complained about the long wait for a drink and she gave me attitude. Told her to take it back that I didn't want it any longer and she did but it still appeared on the bill. The burger was overcooked to well when I asked for mid rare and the appetizer didn't show up till after the entrees. We will never go back. Interesting also that they have that great outdoor patio space in front that is always empty and never being utilized. It just looks like a ghost town and the service and food are second rate."}
{"text":"This could be the best movie theatre in Scottsdale/ phoenix.  The gourmet food and the amazing seats are just to die for.    The staff is super friendly and very respectful when they are in the theatre.    What more can I say except try it out and experience this place for yourself.  I can promise you that you will be thrilled with your experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I were staying in Scottsdale for a few days and, after days of exploring and adventuring, we were too tired to do anything but see a movie by the time the evenings rolled around. So we made our way to the RoadHouse Cinemas to catch up on some flicks. We liked it so much we went two nights in a row!  First, put your feet up in an incredibly comfy recliner chair. Then, order some eats. We recommend the \"children of the corn\" popcorn and the soft pretzel for starters. My husband wasn't the biggest fan of his chicken sandwich, but I really liked my burger. I thought it was great. Juicy and perfectly cooked. And the fries with the garlic aioli on the side are fantastic. I also had the brownie sundae one night. The gelato was great. I'd probably ditch the sundae portion of that in the future and just get that by itself.   The process is easy, they drop food off while you're watching the flick and your bill 30 minutes before the movie ends. We got their early enough both times that we were able to give our card before the film started so check out was a breeze.   The chairs are incredibly comfy and everything, from the lobby to the bathrooms, to the screening rooms, are clean and welcoming. It's not the cheapest night out (tickets were $13.50 plus food and drink if you're so inclined) but it's a really well-rounded night out and a really fun experience if you're a movie goer who likes all the bells and whistles."}
{"text":"SO happy with this new theater/bar/restaurant  all 5 star. We always went to AMC Esplanade but NO longer. We will be making this our new theater for sure.  Food and alcohol were priced great and the movie seat AWSOME!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Always love coming here! Seats are reclining and comfortable, servers are knowledgeable and kind (especially Stephen), food is great and the drinks are even better!   Favorite days to come are on Tuesday's, $6 for a movie! You can't beat it.   Will certainly return.  5/5"}
{"text":"My go to movie theater! The best way to see a movie is in a recliner with waitstaff to fill your popcorn bowl and replenish your beverage. Reserve your seats online ahead of time. There are a limited number of seats in each theater and not all are ideal for a great visual experience."}
{"text":"My favorite movie theater in Scottsdale. You can never go wrong with a beer and the children of the corn popcorn."}
{"text":"I was there to see The Accountant tonight with a friend. Beautiful theater. Loved the reclining seats. Andrew was an excellent server. So polite and courteous. The food was just ok, nothing special. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great experience! Food was delicious! I got the mint chocolate chip gelato as a milkshake and finished it before the movie even started. Seats are comfy and provides ample space between viewers. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I think one of the main reasons to go to a dine in movie theater, is to be able to enjoy a good meal, while watching a movie. We ordered a small pizza and a salad, it took about 1 hour to serve. Must of brought it out during the movie climax. Food was horrible, taste like a frozen pizza. Soggy salad, with very little meat. Will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Roadhouse Cinemas! The food is great with lots of variety (although my favorite item was taken off the menu) they have great desserts especially the shakes, they are a must have my my movie experience. I would recommend you buy them before your movie because a lot of cases, my drinks are forgotten about by the servers so to escape the hassle, just get them with your popcorn at concessions.          The seating is a comfortable recliner and perfect for date night. Honestly the only thing I would critique would be the servers and how often they forget things or get items out to the customers."}
{"text":"First timer and it was nice to enjoy a meal while watching a movie. The seats were recliners and very comfortable. I got a Cuban sandwich and it was was delicious made fresh, my husband got a Ghostbusters burger and it was to die for nice and juicy meat with a spicy flavor. I would go again and recommend you try it as well."}
{"text":"Great place , great popcorn, great ice-cream. Best movie place in a country . Love it"}
{"text":"This place is the best. Great food, good service and the most comfortable chairs ever! Other theaters don't compare."}
{"text":"First off, let me start off by saying: Wonderful customer service!! I was hands down impressed! Everyone went out of their way to make sure we had a good experience. They have {HAPPY HOUR!!} I mean, seriously??!! They have $6 Tuesday's and it was such a cheap date night! We got HH food and 2 rounds of drinks at the HH price! So awesome! They did a great job renovating it - I heard it was $3 million and it looks like it! Love the decor when you walk in! T heathers are small, sears are super comfy, it gives a very welcoming feeling. Will def be back!   If a manger reads this please know your staff is exceptional! We've been to lots of \"updated theaters\" and it because of your staffs service, great specials and food/drink offerings that we will be back. Very impressed."}
{"text":"This is a great theatre. I love the seats, so comfy. My first visit I was really impressed with it, and have gone back several times since. The staff has been really friendly. The popcorn and gelato are great. My only dissatisfaction was that I wanted to try the food, but I was ignored when we sat down to order. We had to leave and go elsewhere to eat. I let the theatre know through an email, but was never contacted back. This was disappointing to me. I will go back to see a movie, but not sure about eating there."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night! Blows all the other dinner/ theatre places away! Great food, service, and selections of movies. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was absolutely the best movie going experience I have had! Every single person was so accommodating, helpful and friendly. My friend and I came early to have an appetizer and drink before our show. All of the beers on tap are brewed locally in Arizona. Our server recommended the goat cheese appetizer and it did not disappoint. Topped with figs and pumpkin seed and with crostini for dipping- it was amazing.  Absolutely delicious!  On our way into the movie we eyed the concession stand and were offered samples of their fantastic gelato. They also have cookies, cheesecake, some candy and 4 different flavors of popcorn. You can order any of this from inside the movie, as well as drinks or anything off the main menu.   The theater chairs were super spacious and comfy, and you can use the recliner to put your feet up and relax. The attached table and drink holder swings comfortably for your food and drinks, or can be easily pushed out of your way when you're done eating.   Ticket prices were very reasonable and apparently Tuesdays are $6 movies all day. Food and drinks were also reasonable priced - I spent $10 on a drink and shared appetizer, and $10 on dinner. My friend got popcorn for $7 which was bottomless and on our way out they offered to bag it and top it off for her so she took home a big bag of popcorn!  I would highly recommend this theater!! Very fun evening out."}
{"text":"Went for the first time to see Girls trip. The movie was awesome! Service was excellent and the food was very good. The theatre was very clean and the seats are very cozy! We will be back to see more movies. They have a great happy hour."}
{"text":"Bummer to write this because I used to absolutely love this place. The food in the bar was terrible (they've taken all the best items off the menu) and the service was even worse (they did not have enough people working in the bar for the crowd). The very nice supervisor had us complete a review card after dinner about the food bc he agreed it has gone downhill. We then go to a movie where we were told in the middle of the movie that we had bought tickets at the box office for the wrong day and they were very rude about it (ticket issue was their fault, not ours). Then the air conditioning broke during the movie (in late May) and no one seemed to care or try to address it with the moviegoers after. I asked to speak with the General Manager and Manager afterwards where they were very unapologetic and had to demand an apology for the ticket situation and treatment and had to demand our money back. This place used to have great food and great service and it has totally tanked. So disappointed and won't be going back. The worst part about this is that, based on tonight's service, I don't think they will even read the review or care that the service has gone downhill.   Edited to include that we are happy to talk with someone about the service, but given that the person we talked to was supposedly the General Manager, I can't imagine it will change anything. But feel free to private message me."}
{"text":"This place is hit and miss. Sometimes I do like this place but today just sat down to this. \"see pic\" sometimes wonder if you do clean and I should bring my cleaning products.  Please take more care and pride You can compete with the big boys like Harkins but not like this."}
{"text":"What a fun day. Hubi and I were able to watch a back to back movie.  Food was delicious surprisingly for a theater, seats were comfortable and the workers were nice.  Because we were there for 2 movies we didn't want to close out the card on file so we asked if the server would be able to follow us to the next theater. I know each server is assigned to certain theaters rooms but they were nice enough to allow this.  Very customer friendly!  But Im guessing also it was a slow day too.  I only gave 4 starts because the 2nd theater room we went into the chairs were still messy with food.  My side table was also pretty sticky.  But luckily I carry face wipes so i just used that to wipe down everything."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Why don't we have this in California!!?!!  -Recliner chairs -Full (awesome) menu -Awesome bottomless popcorn for $7. You can even bring your bowl up at the end and bring a bag home.  -not the nasty yellow movie theater popcorn. Real fresh popped popcorn and you can get it flavored!! Caramel, jalapeño, white cheddar -Did I mention a full bar!? That delivers to your seat?? -In seat food and alcohol delivery -gelato!! Gelato!!  Adorable country western theme! I don't know if I can ever watch a movie in a theater again if it's not here!!"}
{"text":"They have special deals!  They have food and drinks! They have big comfy recliners!  They have Happy Hour!  They have great films!  They are located right next to Hwy 101!  They have plenty of parking available!  They have friendly, professional staff!   . . .  And you can buy your tickets ahead of time on their website!   I can't think of a single reason not to attend this theater.  Roadhouse Cinemas absolutely makes it easy and fun to attend."}
{"text":"Roadhouse Cinemas is a slightly better Studio Movie Grill. With a western theme that is slightly tacky and almost looks like it wasn't given a full effort. I came to this place for the first time due to a Groupon. 2 tickets, popcorn, and 2 beers for $21. The price is unbeatable and I will agree that it is an amazing deal.   The reason this place gets three stars is because it is still a great place to come and so far has been the best Dine-In Movie theater in Arizona I have visited, but the service here is truly lacking. Our drinks took much longer than an acceptable time to arrive. I had to press my call button to check on my drinks before they finally brought them. Server didn't really check on us unless we pressed the call button. I would've ordered more had they checked in.   The Roadtrip for two is supposed to come with two \"fully loaded quesadillas\" but what we truly got was about a half of a quesadilla to share. I understand it's happy hour, but at least be more transparent so that people know what to expect when they order.   The White Cheddar popcorn was a huge bowl of popcorn, I was pleased with it.   The restroom was decent, one out of order urinal but the urine cakes smelled like they hadn't been replaced in some time.    Overall, I will be coming back and will be recommending this place, but I hope management sees the large room for improvement here in the service of the wait staff. This place has a big potential to be five stars if their staff is held to a higher standard."}
{"text":"Probably the best movie going experience I've ever had... No joke.  The customer service, the food, the in movie service, the seats, the overall experience was top notch!  I had my first date at the pavillions movie theatres back when it was United Artists and I've seen many come and go (Regal, Ultra star, etc) Surprisingly I think Roadhouse Cinemas has it down. I hope and pray they stay.   Awesome new look! - let's face it. This place needed a new look. When I walked in I was blown away by the details, the new layout, the style and the feel. You gotta check it out especially if you were a lifelong pavillions movie goer.  The food - we ordered popcorn and it was amazing! Unlimited refills, freshly popped, real butter, spot on! That's all we got but the people next to us ordered milkshakes, French fries, sodas, entrees and more throughout the movie which all smelled and looked like they would be really good.  The service - extremely friendly, all the employees were very happy to be there and willing to help. Oh, and this is a first, as we were walking out atleast 2 staff members in the halls asked us if we needed anything else and gave us a sincere thank you for coming. Unlike most theatres were u get the 15 year old that opens the door for you at the end with the trash bucket telling you \"thanks\" like a zombie. Impeccable!  The movie seats... - this is where the \"new age\" theatres go wrong. They advertise recliners and stadium seating but you can't put your feet up in the new recliners and you are 6 feet away from your wife or girlfriend. Roadhouse nailed this one!!! - they have the best seats hands down. They are twosomes, fully recline and are super duper comfortable!!!! Way to go roadhouse!!!  The best part was the movie we went to see \"Independence Day 2\" was awful.... Horrific... Why, 20 years later, why?...  But... We had such a great time at the movie even though the movie was garbage, we are dying to go back, ha!  You gotta see this place, if your in from outa town or a local, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Loved this theater can wait to go back! It's super cute inside & very western like! The seats are recliner & super comfy! We ordered the chili queso! Great date night!"}
{"text":"I have been to this theater twice now and I can tell you it's been excellent service both times! The facility is clean, well cared for, the employees are genuinely friendly and helpful! I also enjoy the fact that they have extremely comfortable seating, you can book your seat all online and it's less expensive than other theaters. :)"}
{"text":"Not a great experience. Had to wait to buy a ticket when there was no line. Have to wait to get a drink when there was no line as the employee working behind the refreshment counter walked away from me and ignored me. And, no indication of any retribution when discussing with manager. And, they are 30% more expensive than Harkins. Go to Harkins Fashion Square. It's cheaper, better, more convenient, more everything."}
{"text":"I'm torn. I don't dwell on the \"negatives\" often and perhaps I've just been unlucky with the food I've received.   Pros :  -The service is AMAZING which keeps me coming back. Everyone is super attentive and incredibly accommodating. So I LOOOVE that about this place.  -Popcorn and drinks were great! (although a little pricey, but completely understandable for this type of establishment.  Cons:  -The food.... man... It's so incredibly lackluster. I had a wrap the first time and it is what I imagined a refrigerated wrap from Circle K would taste like. I decided to give the food another chance (As I don't believe it's fair to judge a place from a potential one off situation) but the salad I received was just as lackluster as the wrap. The portions aren't substantial so I was glad I filled up on popcorn.   Overall... Great place to see a movie and get some popcorn and drinks. Maybe get dinner somewhere else before or after."}
{"text":"A great place to catch a more in a great environment at a reasonable price. Staff and bartender have always been nice, popcorn and gelato are great. Fried food is typical fried food...greasy   The previous review has never left a good review in her 95 (lol). Just had to defend a place that does a great job and hate people that leave false negative reviews everywhere they visit to make themselves feel better about a miserable life."}
{"text":"The best place to see a movie. You get a full bar before as well as during as they will bring your beverage to your comfortable seat. Lots of food to choose from before, during and after.   A large area to dine is available. You can enjoy before or even hold your event there. I've been to two such events, it holds room for a lot of folks.   A popcorn bar as well as an ice cream are also available. In case you are wondering all the popular movies are showing.  Happy Hour starts at 3pm, Tuesdays is $6 all day, Seniors have Wednesday's specials. You will love it. Make sure you reserve a seat on line to get the best seats!"}
{"text":"I love this theatre and it was my very first time here. I had no idea what to expect. I purchased a Groupon for two tickets and popcorn. We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door. It was easy picking seats. They also have food and a bar which is cool. I think the part I liked most were the comfortable seats. Much more comfortable then most of the competition. Our waitress was attentive and the food we ordered came promptly and was good. I recommend Roadhouse highly and will be back soon since I am a movie buff."}
{"text":"This is one of my top Cinemas in town because it's usually private quiet and the food is good although I really must complain and I really must must insist that they bring back the date cake. They had a really good recipe and it was the closest thing this side of the pond to a sticky toffee pudding. My waiter and I both agreed that we really miss that cake."}
{"text":"We like going to Roadhouse.  My wife really likes it.  Food is good.   Nice and roomy.  The only issue for me is the last 2 times I have say at the bar I can't seem to get a beer.   The dishwasher keeps saying the bartender is coming the bartender is coming but they never seem to come. You can get a drink from your seat but I like sitting at the bar and watching the game before the movie."}
{"text":"Today was my first time at this fine establishment and I picked deadpool 2 for my viewing pleasure! I had a blast! There was like 6 people in total for the 225pm showing. So definitely slow. The servers at the bar were super friendly , and in general extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the beer on tap! The burgers were delicious.  The potstickers were tasty! Will definitely come back again to see the Halloween movie , and other movies without my kids, Much like Disneyland. Just kidding. I'm not a complete douche."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying I have had some good experiences at this theatre, but last night was so bad that I need to tell someone. I rarely even review anywhere.   My boyfriend and another couple joined me at the bar for one of the last showings (8:45) and we got a drink while we waited. The bar tender asked if I wanted a single or a double, we assumed, like most would, that this bar offered a discounted second shot in the double. The bar tender did not tell us any different so I got a two doubles and my boyfriend had two beers. When we got our bill for $53.00 I was pretty shocked and asked if I could see the print out of how much each item costed. Another bar tender rang it up and it turns out that a double of Titos at this bar costs $21.00! Woah. So that's fine, we pay, won't ever order a double again with out asking but the bartenders explanation was \"well that's Scottsdale for you\". No, because I can walk to Buffalo Wild Wings about 200 feet away and pay $11.00 for a double of the same alcohol! Or I could go to the grocery store and buy a bottle for the same price as a double here. But to make it worse the bartender at this theatre free poured the drinks, holding for only maybe 3 seconds, which is not going to be 3 ounces of alcohol. So we were short changed to be certain, buyer and drinkers beware.  Now to the movie, where we were never greeted by our server and had to call to get a refill and put our order in. Took about 10 minutes for her to come, and once we put everything in it took another 15-20 minutes for our drinks to come. The food was fine, no complaints. But, the drink I ordered was not very good so when someone with a very long pony tail came to drop off our food (the call button had been pressed for another 10 minutes) My boyfriend asked him if I could get a different drink and his response was \"you'll have to ask your server bro\" and walked away. Sick. There was all of our dirty glasses and dishes sitting everywhere, I think he could of at least bussed a little. Well when the waitress finally came, I asked if I could just get some lemon for my water and that I did not want my drink or even a different one at this point (didn't even ask if I did want something different anyway, just walked away). Well shocker, the lemons never came! All in all we paid about $150 (including the four tickets we bought for our friends) and I had nothing but bad things to say when walking out. Needless to say our friends had an identical experience. Don't know if we will be back and boy did we look like idiots for recommending this place when taking out our friends. Thanks."}
{"text":"Clean, welcoming atmosphere & nice seats. The negatives:  1. Stalls with no toilet paper. 2. Call buttons that might as well not be offered. Pushed two different times. Waited over 10 minutes both times and had to hunt someone down. 3. Food served cold. 4. Asked for drinks again after waiting til almost the middle of the movie with no delivery.  And asked for sweetener at the time of drink delivery. No sweetener was ever brought. 5. No offer of refills or were plates cleared at any point.  We will check out other dine-in theaters before returning here."}
{"text":"We have in the past enjoyed our experience at Roadhouse. This time didn't fare as well. Our server was pretty attentive and we did enjoy the popcorn. As always it was so so good. But our dinner experience deserves much less accolades. We didn't get our order for what seemed like a very long time, and when it did arrive our meals were at best luke warm. The chicken strips were described as being dipped in a beer batter. They were breaded. Not the end of the world, but they were overcooked and tough. The fries have been great in the past, but served cool are not. The Funguy pizza we ordered was served cool, and not enjoyable. In addition the bowl dinner we ordered was do-able; again luke warm.  I'm not sure who's job it is to deliver the entrees, so maybe there was some confusion with our delivery in a timely manner. But for the 120 dollar price tag for dinner and movie for 3 ( inclusive of 3 alcohol beverages) I really don't think it was worth it. (not inclusive of the 20 dollar tip)"}
{"text":"Our movie started at 7:45, so we got there at 6:50 to eat in the dining area first. We ordered at 7:00, and by 7:35 we asked if our food could be sent to our seats because it hadn't come yet. At our seats (super comfy), it took at least five minutes for someone to come to us, where we found out the kitchen was very backed up with only two cooks. We did not get our food until 8:10, with drinks taking a long time as well. Food is decent, but I'll probably eat somewhere else before the movie next time."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is my favorite. Western/country themed movie theatre with good pop corn and good drinks!  The reclining seats are really comfortable, so comfortable it makes you fall asleep.   They have happy hour on drinks and snacks Monday to Friday 3pm-6pm and cheaper movie tickets on Tuesday's I forgot how much exactly.  They have a variety of draft beers on happy hours to choose from. The popcorn is always tasty here too the cheddar is my favorite they also have caramel and jalapeño too.   Come check this place out. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"6/19: we are back! We love the beer and the popcorn - going for the cheddar + jalapeño mix.  We tried Lynch before the movie.  For $5 the pretzel is delicious except for a few bucks more at OHSO or Four Peaks you get 2 big pretzels. We also got the hummus. SUGGESTION: please take a nod from Pita Jungle and give more hummus. We got a tiny dollop of hummus but the sun dried tomatoes and roasted garlic were great.  We still are disappointed by the fact that the nachos we saw people ordered still look like the ones we got a few weeks ago and they don't look anything like the nachos in the menu.   HINT: make them like the ones in the menu picture! Go to Two Bothers in old town where for about the same price you get a huge plate of nachos with cheeses, beans, chimichurri save, etc.  I will happily continue to come for the beers and popcorn and unmatched chairs in the theater, but the regular food needs to be addressed still.    Let me be clear... This is a food and service review. When it comes to the comfort of the in-theater seating the experience is 5 stars. I do wish that the lighting was brought down a bit for the servers....  Everything else needs work.  Bar: Wife and I sat at the bar for snacks and beer before our movie started. We ordered jalapeño popcorn (really good but heavy on the seasoning) and nachos.  The picture in the menu - a delicious stack of cheese, beans, avocado, sour cream drizzle, and more - had no resemblance to the community pool nachos we got. Chips, cold cheese sauce, no beans, and lettuce and tomatoes tossed on top. We sent it back. HINT: if you are a new place and someone sends food back the. Dispatch a manager immediately to see why.  Here is the \"best part\". We asked for two beers. The bartender - straight face - asks if we want one fresh and then one that \"she poured earlier tonight by accident\". YOU DONT ASK SOMEONE IF THEY WANT AN OLD BEER THATS BEEN SITTING IN THE WINE FRIDGE!!!  Last thing... We carried out popcorn and beers down to the theater. One of the in-theater servers asked to not do this in the future, but to order from them for the \"full experience\". It was not very welcoming.  We want to really like this place but we are not motivated to eat there after the nachos. Will try again once they get their legs under them.  Incredible seats and all local AZ beers make it a 5 star establishment for beer and a move, though!"}
{"text":"My very favorite movie theater !!! The staff is incredibly.... friendly and will to do anything to make you happy  The popcorn is the best. Reclining Chairs ... awesome. \"Why would you go anywhere else to see a movie?\""}
{"text":"We have frequented this establishment a number of times over the last 6 months. Each time, a bit more disappointing. It's quite apparent they are having some financial difficulties. During this visit, they were out of their signature root beer. They were also out of chop salad. For a theatre less than 25% full, the service was mediocre and very slow. Their multi-page full-color menu was replaced with a single laminated sheet. However, a discussion with Manager Josh yielded little resolve, other than he was apologetic and professional. We probably won't be back! We love the dine-in theatre concept, and realize we have other choices in he valley."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! Super-cushy recliners, real butter popcorn, free refills, seat service, extra-friendly employees, beautiful interior. The list of awesome goes on! I can't wait to try more food when we go back."}
{"text":"I Was here today to see Blade Runner 2049 Our waiter Roger was awesome.  The food was delicious as usual.  I love this place.  I got to see my favorite waiter Austin.  Keep up the great work!!!  You will always have my business.  Dawn P Scottsdale    Have been many more times since last review.   the limited items on happy hour just pissed me off yesterday.  On line says one thing and the check another. We spent another $45.00 including tip!!! Never again.  So damn dark by the Table.  Husband stuck his finger in the sauce again. I don't think I can convince him to come back.  We got the wrong mixture of popcorn   Service was slow and we were seated 30 minutes before the show.   SABRINA AND ANDREW ARE GREAT!!!  Thanks for the !!!!   Dawn and Mark"}
{"text":"Wow, just had the most amazing time @ RoadHouse watching the Avenger's!  Not sure about the movie but I certainly know how kick ass the service was! We were greeted by the girls selling tickets and suggested another time frame for better seating, yessss! So we sit at the bar where Bryce and Zac serve our drinks and were both beyond welcoming! Not only did they go out of their way to pop jokes and pour us good drinks, Bryce went out of his way to grab our popcorn and get us ready for our movie.  Now after finishing the movie, we are right back at the bar enjoying great cocktails and an awesome bartender, Bryce! Thank you so much, I freaking love this place and I will 100% be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Movie experience was fine. We used a groupon, and got the popcorn, which was good. However, we did pay full price for the drinks, and they were watered down. Not sure why we paid #$3.50 for watered down pepsi. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Loved this place got a Groupon and it was a great deal !!!! Let's face it for those of us with kids trying to get a babysitter to go out for a dinner and a movie rarely happens for me , Now I have no excuse  we had drinks their mudslide is delicious, the popcorn is made with coconut oil and taste great the seats are so comfy and food is decent and nice selection of wines and IPAs & dessert. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and both times received great service. Food arrived fast and each thing we tried was good. Prices are all reasonable and I will be coming back again."}
{"text":"I would have given a 5 star rating accept this is my 2nd visit in 1 week. I was so excited to find such a wonderful place. Food is good, drinks are good and chairs are very comfy. The only issue is on both visits, upon 2nd order in the theatre, the waiter/waitress didn't put our order in & it was never delivered. They should really assign a couple of people to each theatre so the service is consistent. Until they do that, just go out and get your food/drinks yourself. It will save time and a headache."}
{"text":"MY HUSBAND AND I LOVED THIS THEATER. It tops the Studio Movie Grill with flying colors. The chairs are VERY comfortable, the service was excellent, and we enjoyed the entire experience. We will most definitely be back.    Oh and their popcorn and pretzels, ahhhhh! So delicious. DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THEIR ROOTBEER FROM TAP. Oh man. Great."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and see the newest movies full bar, why haven't i been here before? Full bar and great happy hour, I seriously need to get out more"}
{"text":"We used to always come here for the service, but today we got there only to find out our theater wasn't working. No one seemed to even care how inconvenient this was! They said we could wait an hour to see it in a different theater, where we wouldn't get the same seats so we opted for a refund only to find out they wouldn't refund us the service charge. The manager was totally unhelpful, basically wouldn't do anything for us. We went to harkens instead. The contrast was amazing, so much cleaner, better screens, sound and seats. I couldn't recommend roadhouse in good confidence to anyone, you could buy tickets only to find out it is all a big waste of time."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely wonderful!! It far surpasses the other local done-in theaters. In my opinion, iPic is too fancy and stuffy (and pricy!!) while Studio Movie Grill is more casual and the food is... Not good. This place is truly the best of both worlds! A fun, casual environment with fantastic food!! My one complaint is that I wasn't hungry enough to try more of the food!  One note, don't look up the show times on google because Google has them listed incorrectly!"}
{"text":"It's tough to not compare this one to Tucson's Roadhouse. It was great to see a flick here, but my chair was broken and sloping in, the theater was dirty, and our sole order of popcorn had to be re-ordered. I'll stick with Tucson guys."}
{"text":"Most uncomfortable chair!! My back hurt sitting in it.  Would rather get my own popcorn and have a reclining chair!    The service was excellent but hated the chair."}
{"text":"We come here often but won't be doing so again.   When things go well it is fine but a negative experience and ZERO customer service-is not ok. Movie went ok outside of the waiter sitting on the end of my recliner and dropping me to the floor. My husband paid and we left. Tab was $24.18 for a burger and tea. Burger special was $10. On the way home-hubby says I think we may have been overcharged. I called on my cell on the way home to talk with someone about it and was told we would need to drive back to have someone review our charges-\"it's policy!\" We live in Peoria so I asked to have a Mgr call me back. No call several days later, called and asked for GM, waited on hold 5 min and was told Azra would call me back. That was May 28th-still waiting.   In this day/age and people working hard for their money-lack of decent service and responding to concerns is a huge issue. It costs nothing to listen and hear feedback, lack of will cost plenty."}
{"text":"What a fun place!  Everyone was super friendly and the western theme is adorable. I love the popcorn too! The Great White (white cheddar) and Children of the Corn (regular buttered) is my favorite mixed together but my friend swears by mixing Glazed and Confused (caramel) with the Jalapeño popcorn. So many places have reclining chairs and even dine in services, but Roadhouse has a call button for your server which was really convenient. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great theater, super intimate, good food, great prices, incredibly comfortable seats, definitely my favorite theater in the valley."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  Best movie-going experience I've had...and we didn't even like the movie. Awesome popcorn, the most comfortable reclining seats with foot rest, and extremely helpful staff.   Can't wait to go back soon. My new favorite theater!"}
{"text":"Happy hour 3-5 is the best time to go. Have a few drinks. Eat some delicious food and watch a movie. Their desserts change and they don't always have it on the menu so be sure to ask. There is also a sign outside and on the website that says no kids under 6 permitted. Yet there is a changing table inside and I see toddlers often. I've been turned away once with my son but that was when it first opened. Now there are toddlers often. Especially with the summer children's movies. My advice is to buy tickets online because you get to choose your seat. Don't wait till the last minute because most shows do sell out. It's the best affordable movie theatre."}
{"text":"I've seen a few movies here and tonight will probably be the last. My friends and I saw Infinity War and picture was so washed out you could barely see anything. It's been like this the last few times I've gone. In comparison to a Harkins/AMC or even my tv the picture was poor, the audio was also pretty meh. Lastly the men's bathroom was pretty gross."}
{"text":"- $2 convenience Fee for offering tickets online.      Website is not good - can't see when you eat - salad dressing like ranch tastes like its out of a    packet at KFC - pizza is like cardboard - their thin crust is not thin crust, no flavor like a pizza at Chevron. If you want it crispy, tell em' to burn it.   Do yourself a favor, eat somewhere nearby, then go to the movie and drink there and bring your own snacks."}
{"text":"Simple put the best theater I've been to in all of Arizona.  The best theater seats, the best lay out, the best screens, the best sound system.  The food is descent and it has a great bar set up for those who want to hang out before or after a movie"}
{"text":"5 stars!!! I found a Groupon for this theatre in perfect timing.  I had been trying to think of a place to take my mom for her bday. This Groupon was about  $20 for both tickets, 2 drinks and popcorn. I loved the reclining seats. I also loved that it's semi private, you can't see the people behind you. The popcorn is flavored - we chose the cheddar popcorn.  So delicious.  Served to you in a bowl, not disposable. Makes you feel more at home.  For our meal we chose the burgers and truffle fries.... seriously do not pass up the truffle fries. To die for!!  The menu was super reasonably priced and really good. Not hiked up like you'd expect at a theatre. I wasn't interrupted during the movie. Not even by other ppl calling a server. There's a button you press if you need service.  I also really loved the courtyard they have and decor of the theatre. Classy place and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The reason for the 3 stars: -TERRIBLE nachos. Picture in the menu makes it look amazing. Thing that was delivered looked like it had been sitting in a snack bar window for about a week, complete with orange, pump nacho cheese. It was laughable the difference in what the menu presented versus what showed up. I'm mad we paid $8 for them. I would have been mad had they charged me $2 for them, that's how bad they were. It also made me really gun-shy to try other food.  -One of the bar tenders tried to serve us a flat, stale beer that she had accidentally poured about 30-45 prior to us ordering. She then put it in the wine fridge to apparently serve later and tried to give it to us when we ordered. I know it's their first week, but someone pouring/selling beer should know you can't pour it and save it for later. Kinda beer 101.  -We both sat for a while with our glasses empty and even though we were two of six whole people at the bar. We had to grab their attention when we wanted second beers and needed the check.  -Lighting in the theater was too bright during the movie. Definitely coulda taken it down a few notches and the servers could have easily seen their way around.   I will try it again because: -Theater seats were very comfortable. -All beers are from local AZ breweries and who doesn't like drinking good beer while watching movies? -Popcorn was good.   I'll probably just go straight to the theater to order and I'll steer clear of the food, with the exception of their popcorn. I know they are brand new so maybe in time things will get better. Although these things are a chain so I'm not sure why the food was so laughable- not their first rodeo."}
{"text":"This place started out great and you could see the staff was well trained. Recently had a problem not being able to close out our tab at the end and took about 15 minutes to find out our server was asked to cover other showings and unable to get back to us.  I'm hoping those are growing pains but the environment and food are top notch"}
{"text":"Website doesn't function. Can't get off the home page via mobile.   Also, you have to show up in person to refund tix. Weird. Nbd unless you've had a 10 hour exhausting day at work & make the simple mistake of buying tix  (3 days ahead) to the wrong theater, 90 minutes away. (Dumb. I know. It was a long day) I called immediately and had to sit on hold for 25 minutes after being told I had 3 days to make it to Tucson....what??? Finally elevated and demanded a refund which I got. Bizarre. In 2016 you should be able to call and exchange or refund at LEAST if not online.   Great theater, bizarre policies."}
{"text":"Country style building and decor, at the entrance there is the ticket counter along with a huge bar and an area for snacks which includes popcorn, gelato, sorbet, gourmet desserts, beverages and coffees.   All seats are recliners with a tray, Reserved seats, not too many seats total in the theatre. Our theatre had 5 rows of maybe 8 to 10 seats per row.  We ordered the Fish and Chips, Deep Dish Pizza called the Predator and the other the Rocky. The Fish and Chips came with about four small strip and average amount of fries. The pizzettes were filled with items but almost reminded me of a frozen totinos pizza. It was not bad but I have have better.  Would suggest purchasing a Groupon or getting the gift card at Costco $79 for $100 worth of food and snacks.  I liked the theatre and the seats that recline, the food was okay with a wide variety, would suggest shrinking down the menu and improving the quality of the food.  I liked the snack bar and the bar that was offered.   Our service was slow getting the food, but still received the popcorn quickly which almost made us full before we received the meals.  The Groupon has a couple different selections, one with drinks and popcorn and one with just popcorn, the website says they offer endless refills of popcorn with full purchase, not sure if that is with the Groupon purchase.   Would say the theatre and seats are superior to most dinner theatres, but the food quality is lacking.  Had a good time and will be back only with a Groupon and or the Gift Card from Costco."}
{"text":"Watched the new movie Den of Thieves (7/10). Searing was very comfortable. The food was so-so but what could one expect from a movie theater kitchen."}
