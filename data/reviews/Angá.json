{"text":"Went there to try the picanha but overall was not impressed.  The meat is better that your all you can eat Brazilian restaurants but not by that much and it is not all you can eat.  Just because you serve smaller portions doesn't mean that the food is fancier or better...got 6 sticks of fries for example when ordering that as a side and it was the same standard fries you get at double pizza.  The other cuts of meat were good but this barely three stars."}
{"text":"We came here with a Groupon coupon and though it was nice, we felt it was still quite overpriced. We took 2 different appetizers (the fried calamari & the manioc balls) and they were both very nice. We felt that the two entrees we took (the Moqueca and the Bobó de cámarão) were not outstanding. The passion fruit mousse, however, was delicious (although it was not included in the Groupon). Cozy atmosphere and nice service."}
{"text":"As a big fan of steak I was quite excited to try the food at Anga. However, it was quite a let down. Brazilian food is known for its meat, and a good Brazilian restaurant should be able to tell the difference between medium and medium rare-rare, which unfortunately this chef couldn't. We were a group of 4, and 2 of us liked medium, while the other 2 preferred Rare. However, in the end, all 4 of us got the same cuts of meat all cooked the same way. It was quite disappointing. The cuts that were cooked properly, however, did taste quite good. It is just disappointing to see a place that specializes in steak get it so wrong.

The portion sizes were  also quite small. Furthermore, while the waiter may spin the food and make it sound really exciting, they all tasted quite generic. The manicot aligot tasted like mashed potatoes- it was good, but nothing special.  The vinigarette is salsa with parsley, and the Shrimp flambe was essentially pan fried shrimp.  The dishes were ok, but not great.

The highlight was the coffee and chocolate cream, which was quite tasty. 

Overall, the ambiance was nice and we had a good dinner, just not quite as good as we hoped."}
