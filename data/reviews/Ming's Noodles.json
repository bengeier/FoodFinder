{"text":"I ordered the fried beef noodles and wonton soup through UberEATS and it was ok; more on the not-ok end. Everything was way too salty for me but it was still edible that's why I rated two star out of five. 

If you are in a pinch, this is cheap and fast so I guess go for it."}
{"text":"As a huge fan of noodles, this place fulfilled all my cravings. All handmade noodles, perfectly chewy and delicious variety of soups. Highly recommend to satisfy your belly."}
{"text":"Tried their pork with chili and pepper! So so good with rice, just perfect combo. Mapo tofu is solid as well, I'm sure their dumplings or wontons would rock as well."}
{"text":"Great value for a very specialized region on Chinese food.

Cash only though."}
{"text":"Great noodles!  Very spicy and tasty.  Definitely one of Mississauga's hidden gems!  Order the lamb noodle soup!"}
{"text":"Good food and prices, and plenty of parking. Beef noodle soup used hand-pulled noodles, which were firm and bouncy. Hot oil was plentiful. Will come back."}
{"text":"Firstly I have to say thank you once again to Yelp and the Yelpers for helping me find Mom and Pops close to home. How I never found this place before puzzles me. This totally unassuming place is a hole in the wall but the food was outstanding. I followed Ben O's tip and ordered the Chong Qing Noodles (Just so you know it's a soup dish(I didn't)) and was blown away by a dish I had never had before. I will most definitely be coming back. The food is tasty and cheap.  Keep in mind when you come here the staff doesn't speak much English and the place doesn't look like much but do they ever make up for it with the food."}
{"text":"Came for a steamy bowl of noodles not expecting much from here since in L.A. we have so many good eats.  We ordered 2 different dishes of beef, one stewed tendons with beef and one sliced beef.  And also ordered a veggies dish and 4 different kinds of noodle soup dish.  (4 of us...)  At first taste of the traditional beef with tendon noodles soup I realized we hit a home run in choosing this restaurant.   Real hand made  noodles, soaking up the juicy, meaty rich soup and the chewy noodles that are only that way because the owner made them fresh by hand...   Boy....how we wished this little hole in the wall restaurant was in our city in L.A.....   

The place is very simple.  Very simple, homey feel.  When it gets cold, this is the place you want to come and get a hot bowl of noodle soup.  Decent prices with huge serving sizes.  We could not finish the food and the waitress was nice in offering us microwaveable containers to take back to our hotel.  

  For those that do not like salty food, ask that they make the dishes with less salt."}
{"text":"Went in for grand opening. Have looked for an authentic Chinese noodle place in my part of town for forever and might have found it here! Had two bowls with a friend, and both were fantastic taste.

The ChongQing noodles were spicy and numbing (could've been more spicy!) like it should be! It was a little salty - will ask for less salt next time. The YunNan noodles were savoury and had yellow beans - a nice familiar touch. Soup was tasty.

Service was excellent. The staff were friendly and conversational and quick.

Cheap noodles, friendly service. I don't see why not! Will be back. Would recommend."}
{"text":"First off this place is in a (how do you say it nicely?) plaza. Like others say, don't let the exterior make that big an impact. Actually don't let the interior make a big impact as well. It isn't new, but when you go to eat, isn't the food the most important thing?

So the food, if you lika da noodles, this is the place to go for cheap eating. I ordered a sour pork noodle dish because I love pork and pickled things. My gf ordered some kind of noodles that had peanut sauce in it. Of course hers was much better than mine, because... peanut sauce.

A while back I would have been satisfied with my pork dish, but after eating so many dishes rich with flavour and taste, I am a bit spoiled now. We both couldn't finish our dishes and we usually eat a lot so the portion is definitely good. I think we spent around $20 for both of us to eat. So great value for money.

Great to have a somewhat local option without having to drive to Scarborough for noodles or Chinese. Check it out!"}
{"text":"cheap, fast and clean. 
had 21 and special noodle. 
21 was bit spicy but soup base was good
special noodle was bit of Singapore noodle."}
{"text":"Came here on a random Tuesday with some friends not expecting too much. We wanted a change from the Pho scene and stumbled upon this place. 

The moment I walked in, I felt like I was inside my grandmas kitchen. Chopsticks, napkins and some hot chilli oils. All you need when you head over to grandmas. 

The noodles are hand made by the owner every morning, their broths are very flavourful and their toppings all served a purpose to complement each bite (or slurp).

If your looking for ambience, decor, music go somewhere else. This place is about the food."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've tried a good amount of the noodles here and have liked all of them (my favorite is probably the spicy lamb noodles). I find their broth to be better than most other soup noodle places out there.

The service is pretty quick and price is good - I come here often and would definitely recommend if you like authentic Chinese noodles."}
