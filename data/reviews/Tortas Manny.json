{"text":"My wife had the carne asada fries and really liked them. She gave them 4 stars. My daughter had the quesadilla and my wife & I tried it and thought it was excellen! Definitely 5 stars! I had the carne asada burrito and it was delicious!!! It came with fries as well. I'm a big guy and it definitely filled me up. 5 stars for that as well. I wish I would've taken a picture, but we were to excited to get that food in our bellies to think about it until after the food was gone. The restaurant was very clean and the gentleman at the counter was super friendly and helpful. We will definitely be regular customers!"}
{"text":"Great Tortas! We had the Especial Manny and the Asada and both were delicious. The place is super clean pair with fantastic service. We will for sure be back for more. Highly recommend this spot!!"}
{"text":"Delightful experience. Food was fast, hot and delicious. We ordered one of each taco; the deshebrada was my favorite and my husband loved the cochinita pibil. We also split the deshebrada Torta and I would definitely order it again. Our kids split the quesadilla plate--which was also loved by all.  Everyone working there was so kind and accommodating. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Very sweet staff! Got the Torta Cubana with beans and it was DELICIOUS. Their salsa was really good. Best part was that their bread is freshly made! The entire family loved it. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time yesterday the carne asada tacos were great and the Jamaica was on point."}
{"text":"Best place ever, food is  excelente   , bread is freshly made every day , you can tell water is 100% made from scratch , quality is too good for the price , almost forgot  they have a good customer service"}
{"text":"Great service!! Super friendly, even offered us to try their different flavor aguas frescas. The restaurant was clean. Tortas were really good!! I've tried a few tortas in Phoenix and I gotta say this place is now on top of my list! We got the Especial Manny Torta & the Cubana torta & they were both so good! Will be coming back soon"}
{"text":"Some of the sweetest people I have ever met. The aguas frescas were deliscious and fresh! The torta bread was melt in your mouth. The tacos de carne asada had carmelized onions that gave it so much flavor. The salsas where spot on with the right amount of kick to them. Surpised I could not find them on Google Maps but definetly a gem for South Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great service food it's always fresh made and yummy is a perfect place very clean and peaceful"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, I tried the Manny Especial torta! OH MY GOSHHH its amazing! I've looked for good tortas in PHX and this place definitely tastes just like a torta in Mexico! Everything was delicious I'll definitely be back. Probably tomorrow"}
{"text":"What a GREAT place.  Killer tortas...and the bread!  Superb.  Exceptionally clean, friendly and a super value.  I would go there very frequently if I lived closer but will always stop by when in the area."}
{"text":"Food was good, but don't be in a hurry, took 20 minutes to get my burrito. Only two people working of which only one spoke English. I probably won't go back even though the food was good because I can't justify waiting that long for a burrito...."}
{"text":"Muy recomendado. El servicio brindado por Alejandra fue uno muy bueno, todo el tiempo estuvo al pendiente de nosotros y fue muy simpática en todo momento. Cuando el servicio es así a uno le dan deseos de regresar. La calidad de la comida también excelente. Yo pedí una quesadilla de carne asada y la carne estaba perfecta. Todos en la mesa quedamos satisfechos con nuestros plato. Me alegra saber que tengo un nuevo lugar para comer y lo mejor es que esta súper cerca de mi casa. Sigan con la misma calidad que tendrán mucho éxito!"}
{"text":"The food was decent and the establishment was clean they do not serve fountain drinks so you get a can drink no free refills. The reason I gave them 3 stars is they advertise ceviche and don't serve ceviche. Me and the kids ordered two cheese crisp and rice and beans and they kept suggesting French fries and I had to keep reiterating no they want rice and beans. I order two Asada tacos and two green chili tacos. We sat down and about 10 mins later two gentlemen walk in and order and they got their food and left and we were still sitting waiting for our food. The chef said hello to them and each person walking in but he never greeted me so I felt he may be a bit bias. But regardless the food was okay but not worth for us to keep coming back."}
{"text":"First time customer and was super impressed!! It's a cute spot too. The agua de limon was perfect! The staff that was working tonight was super nice and just made you feel welcome when you enter the restaurant! Definitely coming back again!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Tortas Manny. The restraunt is small. However, the staff is friendly and accomdating, and thats why I feel terriberible having to say the food just wasn't very good.  On this visit we ordered chips/salsa, beef flatas and tostitados preparados. The salsa/chips were okay. I was disappointed with the beef flatas,  the meat was somewhat dry and slightly overcooked, and the dish was covered with so much topping, it made the flatas soggy and the tostitado dish, I did not care forvat all.  The pricing is very wallet friendly, you can get a better Mexican meal, but you'll have a hard time getting more food for the price."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Got an order of tostilocos and wasn't disappointed. I imagine the food is just as good, because it smelled awesome while they were cooking some else's order as I waited. My family and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Some of the best Tortas (Chihuahua style) I've had in Phoenix. The bread is fresh baked in house and it's delicious.  Their natural fruit drinks are very good as well. I will definitely be returning here... The customer service was also great. =)"}
{"text":"We live in south phoenix and there is no shortage of great Mexican food out here. This place is among the best though.   We went here on a whim and were not disappointed. The family running the place has been in the restaurant industry for 25 years and about a year ago opened this location. Their bread is baked fresh every day and is some of the best bread I have had...pillowy soft, buttery and smooth and the perfect foundation for building an exceptional sandwich.   My wife had the pierna  and I had the cubana and strangely neither of us had order envy. They serve all their sandwiches with a house salsa that is absolutely amazing, a smokey, spicy sauce that just added a great depth to the sandwiches. My Cubana was a excellent, roasted pork with carnitas adobadas, avocado, mayo, jalapeño, tomato and lettuce...i have had Cubanas before, but never like this. The Mexican spin on the classic sandwich made for a spectacular surprise. The spicy with the creamy, the crunchy with the soft, the meats cooked to perfection. I will be dreaming about that sandwich until I go back and destroy another. Top the meal off with a medio litro of Coca-Cola Mexicana and you have the recipe for a happy boy.  The fact that the owners don't speak much English should not dissuade you, frankly it added to the authentic nature of the meal. So, take a drive to the south side and have one of the best sandwiches you can ever expect in your life. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was at the store next door and needed some food. The people were really friendly upon my arrival and they recommended the carne asada torta. For my first torta it was amazing. The bread was very good and they season their meat well. I had also got some tacos and they were just as good."}
{"text":"I got the Especial Manny torta and two tacos. The torta was on point. It was load! Fresh topping and bread. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at Tortas Manny for the 2nd time. I had the Carne Asada tacos and she had Carne Asada Torta. The tacos and the Torta were made fresh and tasted delicious. The interior of the restaurant is very clean and the staff is very courteous and kind. I would recommend Tortas Manny to anyone who likes Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I got the carne asada casadia and it was amazing. Tons of flavor in the carne. It comes with grilled onions, avacado, tomato and cheese. With fries or salad on the side. My girlfriend got the Torta Manny and she says it was delicious as well."}
{"text":"This was one of the best Tortas I've ever eaten. The bread is absolutely amazing, the meat was cooked perfectly, the sauce was just spicy enough. It was fast, clean and delicious. HIGHLY recommend!"}

{"text":"The food here is really tasty and reasonably priced. Located next to the Bank of America on  7th Ave and Southern.  Stopped by because I was curious and was so happy I did."}
{"text":"We recently moved to Phoenix and have not been able to find a good torta spot, but this place was amazing. Very clean and the food tasted amazing. We had tortas, tacos, and the agua frescas which  were super delicious! Will be back, everyone should give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Especial Manny... OMG BOMB!  PRICE IS GOOD, PORTIONS BIG, PLACE IS CLEAN!!!!!  I'm native Californian and tried so many places in AZ for TORTAs. Found the perfect place and not to far from my home. The people are so nice and know the true value of customer service \"family ran\". My whole family loved the TORTAs which were big in size.  Tacos I personally didn't care for, but my brother in law loved. We have been a couple times and will continue to go for food."}
