{"text":"The food is decent and the environment is nice and relaxing but the service is awful here. I've been here quite a few times and the service always sucks. The waiters/waitresses take way too long and you usually get served by 3-5 different people. I always see the waiters/waitresses standing around talking to each other instead of actually working."}
{"text":"I have been to JOEY @ Don Mills and Yorkdale. 
One of my favourite dishes from Joey is their cheese and meat board. Yesterday it was one of my gf's birhtday and we took her out to dinner @ JOEY Yorkdale. This is our usual spot when we get together. It has been awhile since we been here and they made some changes to their cheese and meat board. Not good very good changes. I was little disappointed. For my main, I ordered the 1/2 rack ribs and it was alright, I had better ribs else where. 

All in all this is the perfect for girls dinners and some drinks."}
{"text":"Love the food, spent over $100, told the waiter it was my birthday... And still no free birthday dessert? WILL NOT RETURN EVER AGAIN! #EmphasisAdded"}
{"text":"You are taken care upon entrance to exit.  Asked where we'd like to sit. Waitress knew her menu. Did not need to write the order. Asked if there were any allergies; if spicy sauce preferred on side. Water glasses were constantly filled. Asked many times over if everything is okay. Napkins constantly placed on the table. Asked by manager what our thoughts were on the food. Told him as above in addition to the food and presentation being excellent. Joey delivers it all.  It's the best place to eat in this mall. I guess they appreciated my comments they deducted the appetizer off the bill. Wow. Totally impressed. That's the way to do business in such a competitive industry. Bravo"}
{"text":"Average at best. Drinks are ok. Food is ok. Service is ok. They could definitely improve"}
{"text":"Food sometimes hits, sometimes misses.  I believe their tuna dishes are amazing and really define this restaurant.  Avoid the sushi and steak - neither is bad but given the price, one is better off going to a sushi/steak house for those.

Decor and service is excellent.  Very few places hit that premium casual look.

The chefs here cook better than the chefs in JOEY at Eaton Centre."}
{"text":"Shitty service garbage restaurant...don't waste ur time coming here they will lie and tell u the wait is 10 minutes and 45 minutes later u will still be waiting"}
{"text":"Management at JOEY should teach their staff manners. I called the Yorkdale location today as I saw someone online mentioning that JOEY has a birthday promotion so i wanted to call to verify.  The first time i called, they immediately hang up without giving an answer. I thought, ok, maybe they didn't hear my voice so they thought nobody is there so they hang up.  I immediately called again and asked the same question, again they just hang up.  I think that was rude that they do not have the decency and manner to answer a simple 'no' or whatever.  They were short-sighted to think that, even if there was a promotion, they don't know how it would bring more business to them as it's not just the person who has the birthday is coming...the person would bring other people too.  They have lost my business anyway and I would tell my friends my experience as I do not want to go to such places where acting arrogantly is the culture there."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here, had the tempura shrimp sushi cones in rice paper which were super tasty and also the lobster grilled cheese -though very good i found it to be have excess grease and had to blot it down with my napkin. Substituted the fries for yam frites w/ Garlic aolli. All in all the meal was great, server/service was good. Definitely a step above the other restaurants at Yorkdale.
Will be returning to try out some of the other items on the menu"}
{"text":"Went to Joeys yesterday for a birthday lunch. Food was absolutely delicious! I had the calamari fritto, which was to DIE FOR and the Ahi Tuna sandwich. The calamari was tender and crispy, the sauce a perfect complement. The Ahi Tuna sandwich was good as well - however the fish was cooked more than I expected. If you want just a sear, be sure to tell them that you want the fish raw in the middle. But all in all, delicious! We were to full for dessert but I will definitely be back to try their famous apple pie! Service was pretty good as well, food came very quickly and our waitresses were very nice."}
{"text":"(updated name only) Tonight's Joey experience was a mixed bag.... but thanks to their amazing staff Britney, it became a better experience because they proved that they truly cared about their customer feedback! kudo to Britney and thumbs down to our server. 

We decided to drop by Joeys to have an after work mall walking and impromptu date night. 
We were greeted by hostess with big smiles. Good customer service to start...

However, the experience went downhill from there. 
We could tell that there was a problem when it took almost 5 minutes before someone came by and asked us for our drink selection. After the water was delivered, our server came by. Ms. M (dont want her to get fired) is a somewhat shy server and we could tell that she was a bit inexperienced. When we ordered our steak dinners, she did not ask us how it should be done. So, we knew that she is a newbie. But hey, she needed to get experience and we went along and tried to give her our order without being too complicated or condescending.  We ordered an appetizer, and 2 steak dinners. There were some minor changes: substitute the vegetables to Cesar salad, remove onions from my order, and go light on the Cesar salad dressing on one order.   Otherwise, it was all good.  
When the sliders arrived, it had onions but i just picked it off, and did not complain. 
We were seated quite close to the open kitchen and therefore, it gave us a view of where our food was lining up under the heat lamp (yes, I had bad experience with my steak turning from medium rare to almost well done due to negligence) . 

Our slider sat for a bit but it was slider, it was already well done. We ate it and by then, our water was done... It was a min. 5 minute wait for water service. 

Then the steak dinners arrived. they were sitting pretty under the heat lamp for a few minutes. finally, our server got our steak which fortunately were still medium rare, getting closer to medium. 

Unfortunately, there was a mixed up of my food and it had onions all over my potato. Ms M noticed it and started to switch the food right on our plates.  In the repositioning, she spilled my partner's mushroom sauce on my plate and on the table.  She ran to get a towel to wipe it up.  I was actually surprised that she did not go back to the kitchen and re-arranged our food which would have avoided this mishap. 

But guess what, now my partner had half the sauce.  Instead of offering to replace the sauce, our server sort of disappeared for a while. After we found her, we asked for another sauce. Of course, my partner thought it was nice of her to do it. The sauce came after about 10 minutes which we were surprised but it did come fresh and hot.

Now we could finally start to enjoy our meals. Well, i realized that Joey's chef loved Salt. While the steaks were tasty, they were very salty and covered with 1/8 inch of steak spice. 
The special smashed potato looked a bit like Pig in a blanket. It was an unique concept as it was mashed potato wrapped in spring roll wrapper and deep fried, dripped with sour cream and cheese. Definitely different than your run of the mill mashed potato..

I managed to consumer the salty steak because i was quite hungry from waiting for my partner's mushroom sauce... (dont want to be a rude date and start eating).

After a while, I dug into my Cesar salad which i found out was dripping with salad dressing. It was definitely not lightly dressed. I tried to eat it but I could not.I decided to ask Ms M to see if my salad could be replaced. She said \"sure\" and went off to the kitchen order counter. 

well, that was the last time we saw Ms. M (20 minutes and counting) because we managed to finish our food and our plate was collected by another server, and our leftover steak was packaged by her as well. Ms M  came by and asked if we wanted coffee or dessert without mentioning about our salad.  By then, we had enough of salty food, missing salad and simply silly experience.  We asked for the bill and found out we had to pay for $3.50 for the extra sauce. We asked for it to be removed from the bill which she did. We gave Ms M the minimum tip of 10%  before tax which was not our usual tipping habit, because we knew that the server staff worked hard for their money. 

When we left Joeys, we swore that this will be our last visit... and while we were walking out, Britney approached us and asked us how was our experience tonight.  This was when I did the unusual thing and spilled my guts (not literally, the food was salty but fresh) about our experience. Britney pulled us aside and listened to the whole sordid details...then she apologized and asked if we minded waiting. Then she came back with a gift certificate and asked us to come back...She would also let the chef know that the food was over salted. 

NOW this is the saving grace for Joeys!  Attentive management and great recovery!

So they got our business back, and a 4 Star rating... Thank you Britney !  You are a the 4-Star!"}
{"text":"I've been to all of the Toronto locations and this is definitely my favorite one. The staff is very friendly and the food is always amazing! Best things to get there are the edamame, beach salad, and their chicken lettuce wraps. The edamame is so flavorful and a perfect appetizer that is not too filling before the main dish. The beach salad is amazing as well. It has a perfect mix of strawberries, avocado, candied pecans, and goat cheese. It is the perfect combination and the serving is huge! Lettuce wraps are great as well. Definitely will continue visiting this location!"}
{"text":"I had Chicken taglaliatelle and apple pie for dessert. I was not impressed by the flavor of any of the two. It has a good ambience and a good service."}
{"text":"One of the highest quality restaurants! 

The food here is one of the best food I've tasted. The only problem is that it's quite expensive. 

Service was a bit slow.

I would recommend as a place to go out with your date ;)"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant on my birthday and I must say I wasn't disappointed. Ambiance is nice, servers are courteous and the chefs are at the top of there game. I had always been a fan of there steak and burgers, very juicy and perfectly paired with complementing sides."}
{"text":"I had never been to this location before but the atmosphere was the typical JOEYS. 

My friend wanted to sit at a booth so we requested that to the hostess. You could tell that she had a bit of attitude as she sent us upstairs to be seated. I didn't see the hassle in it as we went at 5pm and there was a lot of empty tables. 

We got seated and ordered our food. I ordered the French Dip Sandwich and was quite impressed with it. The meat was cooked just right as it was really tender and moist.

Our waitress did not come around to check on us nor did she refill our water once we were done.   

The food was good but the service was so-so"}
{"text":"The decor is fabulous, quite dim lighting, the food was okay the ahi tuna tacos were good, had the steak and sushi entree...the steak was good but the sushi was mostly rice. The service was intense and made us uncomfortable. It felt like the waitress was right up our butts, coming back literally every 2 minutes to ask us if we were going to order more, some people may think thats a good thing but seriously it was way too intrusive...she had an antagonistic demeanor until we started pulling out cash when she gave us our bill. IF YOU ARE IN YORKDALE GO TO MOXIE'S INSTEAD."}
{"text":"The food was FANTASTIC!  I had the ribs and fries, FANTASTIC!, the GF had the fish tacos, FANTASTIC, her sister had Florentine Ravioli, CLEAR WINNER!  The server was super friendly and the atmosphere is great. I am finally impressed by the restaurant in yorkdale. Pickle barrel and moxies pay attention!"}
{"text":"Every time I come I order the steak and sushi is a great option if u want to eat a little and get full:)"}
{"text":"I have to say they figured out apple pie!! The mix of pecans and caramel with the apples and pastry made it one amazing dessert. We sat in the bar area upstairs, and it was a great spot. I would have given 5 stars however it could be the result of sitting in the bar area, but the service was a little slow. Maybe next time I will sit in the dinner area!!"}
{"text":"As a picky vegetarian that normally doesn't eat out in non-vegetarian establishments, I went to Joey's with girlfriends and was so impressed that I can't wait to go back. The customer service was the best I ever experienced in a restaurant. They were super busy and super booked but tried really hard to accommodate us, including my 8 month pregnant friend who could not sit on their high chairs limiting our seating capabilities further. As a strict vegetarian I had a million questions and didn't expect any answers (as I usually don't get any from servers)..they answered every single question. The servers are so knowledgeable about the food and the abilities of the kitchen staff to accommodate and to modify orders. Lastly, the food was sooo good. The prices are a little high for the portions which I found to be good for some dishes but lacking for others. My lettuce wraps left me hungry, but that could have also been because they were soooo yummy! The yam fries were so good as well. This is definitely going to be my next go to place to eat with my hubby who likes his meat. Finally somewhere we can both enjoy to eat at."}
{"text":"Service is always awesome

Ahi Tuna tacos are better than the other fish tacos 
Ahi Tuna sandwich is bomb as well
Love the chili chicken
Butternut squash soup was very light and tasty

Best restaurant in the mall for sure. Very good place to just take a friend to brunch to and catch up. Love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Many options at Yorkdale - Joey restaurant is a good one.  Packed on Friday nights - espicially with the Jays on tv at the bar.  So we opted to sit in the upstairs dining area.  The place is accessible to everyone. Don't want to walk the stairs then take the elevator. 
What's good - steak and the mash potato roll, key lime pie, servers
What's disappointing - nothing; good meal, good conversation and great ambience.
We picked a good night.  I will go back again."}
{"text":"The food is 5-star but the portions are so tiny and the prices so high, it is very hard for me to even give this 4-stars - so I just lowered it to 3-stars. But the food quality itself is 5-stars. If you are a skinny woman who eats like a bird then go here, you will have a fantastic time. Me: I leave hungry every time. I literally buy food right afterwards, which of course looks bad for my date but what can I do? That said: the food is oh-so-good. I've eaten here twice and the entrees ordered by my party have always been delicious - everyone thinks the tastes are incredible. In particular the chicken sandwich, pasta, roast chicken, ribs and salads are great. The Moroccan Chicken Soup in particular was to die for. Now for an organic transition: there have been shootings at this location (gunfire through the patio windows), so use caution when dining here. There seems to be an increased, visible police presence at the mall and Joey's in response, and it didn't stop me from eating here last week, though it did sway me away on several other occasions."}
{"text":"Fish taco's are great, friendly and efficient service. It's a plus when parking is available directly outside."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday late afternoon while on vacation and place was packed! We were a group of eight and didn't get to sit together at one table. We had to settle for two tables side by side. I had been looking forward to trying it here because I've heard many good things about it. I must say I thought there would be just a few more choices on the menu of things I might like but nonetheless I found something I really liked and boy, was it good! I had the crispy chicken sandwich with fries. It at different toppings and was very tasty! For a starter, our table got the yam fries which were cooked perfectly. Not burnt or soggy. We also got the chilli chicken. Again, really good and had some kick to it. Other dishes gotten by the tables were lettuce wraps, fish tacos and sushi. All were good and no complaints by anybody. Even though it was super busy, service was pretty prompt and waitresses were very friendly towards us. All in all, a good experience my first time here. Would like to try the Don Mills location as well."}
{"text":"Ordered their salad called \"The Beach\" and it was sooo good. 

Prices are a bit pricey but the portions were good and our waiter (Adam) was super friendly and provided great service!"}
{"text":"Went there on a busy Friday night. Bad idea. Had to wait for like an hour for a table. 
Food: better than a lot of other bar-type restaurants
Atmosphere & interior design are great as well. 
Some friends of mine go there all the time. 
Their servers are really friendly."}
{"text":"Canadian chain restaurant with the usual young female servers in short skirts.

 Food seems to be consistent with the other Joey's that I have frequented for dinner at Coal Harbour in Vancouver, Calgary location near their main shopping mall and this one in Yorkdale that is adjacent to the upscale Yorkdale Mall.

Came here on October 20th for dinner after walking the mall and ordered their cheeseburger with sautéed mushrooms with a sub of a Caesar salad instead of fries. Burger and salad were good and well executed despite the fact that Canada restaurants will not serve anything medium rare.  Like the other yelpers - $$ are slightly higher for what you get but then again this is a Joey's and after all this is Canada.

Like the other Joey's this place is causal and hip with a great vibe if you are dining alone or with a group. I ate at the 1st floor bar but noticed that they have a 2nd story bar as well which was not busy due to the fact that I arrived at 5:30 pm on that day."}
{"text":"Great location, spacious restaurant, delicious food but the service is always delayed because they are always busy. Been to this location 5 times but they've always been very busy so that's the reason to have some delay in their service, but the quality and the taste of food, salad and desert is always good"}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday night, and it was packed.  I'm not exactly sure why....    It's not that it's a bad place, but it certainly isn't anything special enough to seek out.  I suppose if one is at a mall then there aren't a lot of options, and so the shoppers flock here.

Food is OK, decor is OK, service is OK... the menu is all over the place, with sandwiches, sushi, steak, roast chicken, seafood....  not sure exactly what type of restaurant it is.  

Not a bad meal, but certainly not a great meal.   What can you expect if you're dining in a shopping mall?"}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes the servers are all very attractive.  It's the first thing you'll notice.  That and the stairway to heaven.  

So we're seated upstairs, and we order some drinks.  Mojito deserves 2 thumbs up.  Now we decide to share everything so we order the chicken lettuce wraps, the sushi rolls, and the grilled salmon.  For dessert, the donuts.  

*Chicken lettuce wraps--where's the chicken?  Hmm.  Lots of noodles and other crunchy things but no obvious chicken.  Also-way too sweet for my taste. 

*Sushi roll was alright.  Just what you'd expect.

*Grilled salmon was deeelish.  You could taste the fact that it was just grilled.  Smoky, slightly sweet, we were really surprised and happy that it tasted so fresh.  Just slightly overdone but forgiveable because the flavour was so good.  

*Donuts were quite large, you get 5 in an order.  Hot and fresh they were made even more tasty dunked into the lemon vanilla sauce that came with.  

So yeah, it's a nice option to Milestones and Moxie's.  But for sure it's along the same vein as those restaurants."}
{"text":"drinks are expensive and have barely any alcohol. food is pretty good. servers arent the greatest. lots of attitude."}
{"text":"Went there after work with friends and loved it!
The atmosphere is awesome, the place looks modern and fun. 

The service was fantastic, they were quick and had an amazing attitude even though you could tell they were busy. 

I ordered a steak with veggies everything was cooked perfectly. 

Loved it will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Well joeys use to be amazing but somehow they have changed the menu
Their portion size went smaller but there price which were already on the higher side went up ."}
{"text":"Visited JOEY for a business dinner with three guests from out of town. 

I hate to start off a review with a constructive criticism, but it is really one of few such remarks about my experience: Service at the hostess booth can be improved as the young ladies there look dazed and confused about what is going on and take a significant amount of time to recognize and greet customers. JOEY's weakest point would be our first interaction with their staff here. Otherwise our experience continued quite positively.

Ordered some drinks and beers that were on special -- all arrived rather quickly. 

Shared the yam fries and artichoke dip to start; both were quite delicious and we polished off the crumbs off the plates. 

I ordered the 12oz. New York -- cooked to perfection and accompanied by delicious sides. If you're hungry and a meat eater, you'll love this. (8/10)

Fellow diners ordered the Bombay Butter Chicken Bowl (guest said it was mediocre), Herb Crush Salmon (guest said it was excellent!) and the 7oz. CAB Sirloin (also excellent). 

Our server was incredibly friendly, helpful and fun!

We ended the meal with a shared molten lava cake which was amazing!

Dinner is on the expensive side for a chain restaurant, but the experience, quality and service are worth it."}
{"text":"Asked for my \"protein burger\" (meat on lettuce) to be brought back twice, as it was pink both times.  The waitress and manager were very polite, and offered me a refund, and I know some people prefer their burgers this way... but for a burger, I don't want to see pink."}
{"text":"The food is as delicious as ever, but the portions have reduced significantly over the years. I mentioned this to the server (I know it's not the server's fault, but the restaurant management needed to hear it). So the management did approach us and verified that the portions have not reduced in the slightest. My friend later found a picture of the herb crushed salmon she took years ago, and we were right, the portion had been reduced sneakily since when the restaurant first opened. One of my other girlfriends who normally eats a lot less than us was still hungry. Not worth my $25.50 anymore. It's a great restaurant, but we've decided to not return there.

Sorry, Joeys. Taste is important, but it's still more important to be satisfied with your meal."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere at this location, very open and comfortable setting. There food is pretty good but service is slow!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Rotisserie Chicken Bistro Plate and found a used Band-Aid in my food.

{"text":"As a fan of this chain of restaurant, which recently started popping up around Toronto, I wanted to have lunch there when I was shopping at Yorkdale Mall.  

The interior was definitely a lot bigger than the Eaton Centre location, with the bar, lounge and a few dining areas on the first floor and the main dining area on the second floor with an open kitchen. This is a very trendy place.

 Wild & Creamy Mushroom Soup - delicious, one of the best I've had! Not too thick, not too thin, it was jut right with the right amount of cream.  It was rich enough to feel bits of mushroom.

I also tried one of their signature 'JOEY Bursts', which is one of three flavours (lime, strawberry, raspberry) with soda water.  It' very concentrated and delicious to drink if you want to opt out of an alcoholic drink.

 Bacon Cheddar Burger with fries was high-stacked! I couldn't fit it in my mouth at once but had to squish it down.  The taste was very good, though.  The bread was fresh, soft and the burger was thick and well-seasoned.  The fries on the side was yummy too, although, it doesn't beat their sweet-potato fries.

Overall, if you're going for a date or a night out with your girlfriends, I recommend trying one of JOEY restaurants in the city for its chic environment, yummy drinks and delicious food."}
{"text":"The man-friend and I hit up Joey at Yorkdale on a busy Friday night. The restaurant is newly opened, and when we arrived at around 6:45 was super busy.

We put our names down for a table for two and then went off wandering through the new section of Yorkdale. I`m not sure why so many people were waiting in the entryway to the restaurant when the whole mall is there to enjoy. About thirty mintues later, which was the time we were quoted, we got a call saying that our table was ready.

We returned and pushed our way through the crowd to the host stand where we were promptly seated. Service was good and really fast - man-friend and I don`t need a super romantic drawn out dinner, we live together, but we were in and out in less than an hour.

We only ordered sodas to drink (I work Saturdays!) and didn`t order super fancy menu items, but the server never seemed annoyed that we wouldn`t necessarily be a big ticket table. She and the rest of the service team were always nice (and all so attractive.)

I can`t write this review without mentioning the decor - it`s straight up gorgeous. The huge windows upstairs deserve a better view than just the parking lot!"}
{"text":"Come into this particular location pretty often. The food and service is always phenomenal. However when my boyfriend and I came in yesterday i was extremely disappointed. I ordered a farmers market chicken salad and it was brought to my table without avocado, almonds, corn and radishes. When I explained to my server the items that were missing she brought them over to me in a small dish and once again forgot some of the items. Frustrated that my chicken was now cold and that some items were still missing i pushed the salad to the side. The sever never came back to check up on us. When she finally returned she asked if i was done with my salad. She took it away and then charged me for the salad. Being in the service industry i was extremely disappointed with the lack of care and service. I will never be back again."}
{"text":"Always make sure to ask for the secret mash potatoes spring rolls ! It's their best kept secret, so delicious that \"it doesn't even make sense\". Great service and food suggestions. Ordered a chocolate old style and loved it. Fish tacos tasted spectacular and was suggested by kwaqu the server. Definitely would like to return."}
{"text":"Always a fan! Great service be sure to call in ahead depending on the day/time. I'm a big time burger lover and Joey's Yorkdale location has the best burger in town. Be sure to try out their fires also good wine selection."}
{"text":"Joeys have been opening all over Ontario recently, and this is my first time here! 

They take very limited reservations (only if you book days in advance), and you'll be expecting to wait between 30-45 minutes if you just walk in. I came here on Black Friday, so checked in around 6:30pm to get a table at 7:30pm. I wouldn't have waited so long if there wasn't a mall right next door! I got a chance to do some early Christmas shopping! 

The hostesses were very friendly, and offered complimentary wine while we waited. They were also very knowledgeable of the menu and made suggestions, which is why I ordered the Florentine Ravioli. It was packed with spinach and cheese, covered lightly with cream sauce and four pieces of scallop that were larger than what I usually see at other restaurants. My boyfriend's baby back ribs were A-OK, he said he preferred the ones at Montanas, which are juicier. 

I LOVED the apple pie we had for dessert! It was freshly baked, crispy on the edges and topped with pecans and a scoop of hazelnut ice cream. Nom nom nom! 

Overall, a very nice experience at Joey, and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Can say after 2 visits here in the past month that this location does not hold a remotely close candle to the service in Alberta and BC.  

Would say,,, prolly never returning to Yorkdale location, been spoiled by the great service at Joey's Barlow in Calgary and Joey's Burnaby in BC."}
{"text":"Mannnnnnnn I went here yesterday with 5 friends and we had a blast. Our waitress was awesome and so attentive and very pretty too! 

We had: lettuce wraps, calamari, tandoori chicken flatbread, lobster and shrimp ravioli, veggie burger, curry bowl and everyone loved the food. 

I would definitely visit again and can honestly tell you some of their items hit it out of the park and some leave a little to be desire. So it really does matter what you order here."}
{"text":"Delicious food. I love the tuna salad and the steak. Almost everything is a safe bed here. Fun n nice atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before with co-workers during the workday, this time was my first weekend experience.  I can say with certainty that no matter which day of the week or what time of the day you choose to dine here, the service is always sub-par.  

Seating was quick, waitress also came quickly to take out drink order, but after that....not so much....
2 people at our table ordered burgers and they came out first, than about 10 mins later the 2 steak dishes followed.  Just poorly timed. 

But service aside, I pretty much had the best veggie burger I have ever had.   Mind blown.  
It was delicious!!! Veggie Patties tend to have the texture of, for lack of a better word, cardboard.  Usually flavorful, but rarely tender and juicy.  The veggie burger at Joey's is made in-house and was tender, juicy heaven.  Garnished with avocado, alfalfa, arugula, tomato and pickles. 
Yumm-O and no ketchup required! 

My side of Yam fries with garlic aioli and truffle oil was also really good, too bad I couldn't finish them..the burger was just so filling.  The others at my table helped out with finishing my yam fries (no complaints)!

Bonus points for this restaurant having a separate gluten-free and vegetarian menu."}
{"text":"Good:
- Atmosphere
- Food selection
- Location

Ok:
- Service 

Bad: 
- Drink selection (IE: no pitcher options)"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Good food, well-prepared drinks and excellent, upbeat service!"}
{"text":"The best thing about Joey Yorkdale is the food. It was really good! I went for lunch and had the rotisserie chicken with garlic bread, my friend had the spring salad and house soup. all of it was amazing! What wasn't so great was the service. Which was surprising since the prices are a bit steeper than competitors so we assumed the service would be A+, but that was not the case.

When I entered on the main floor they directed me to the upper level where someone would seat me. No staff were at the host stand (though the whole floor had only 1 table of customers)- and about 6-7 staff members were standing around chatting. after a few minutes someone came by and brought me to a table. The server we had was not knowledgeable at all.. we asked him about ingredients in the soup and he didn't know (which is ok), BUT when we asked him to describe a particular item on the dessert menu (some sort of chocolate cake or mouse- it wasn't clear) he said \"I don't know what it's like because noone ever orders it.\" (seriously? there are 4 items on the menu!) he didn't go ask anyone either, just left it at that- needless to say, we didn't get dessert. and left shocked that the server really didn't care at all. Again, this was lunch and it was a weekday and not busy at all (when we left maybe 4 tables of 2-4 in the upstairs dining area. 

If you actual want your servers to respect you and be decent- there are a number of other restaurants in the mall where you'll get this, but Joey isn't one of them"}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice but have visited various Joey's locations while living in Edmonton.  So my experience as compared to others would be a bit more biased.  

I would agree with Kris U that the service was lacking as after our late lunch was over, the staff was literally non existent.  Our server didn't mention his shift was over and the manager had to take care of our bill at the end.  

The food here is always good and it's literally the same menu at all locations.  The seating is pretty good whether you're in the dining area or the lounge.  

I like the new design of their website, especially the reservation section.  It gives you various options to be either put on a waiting list or make reservations, as long as your party is under six.  The waiting list is good for weekends because it gives you the opportunity to reserve long before you arrive instead of waiting for a long time upon arrival. 

It's just too bad that this was the location of two bad incidents a few months apart.  Torontonians would know this quite well."}
{"text":"Been here about 3 times now - so it's good enough for me to come back!

Pretty good, but not great... Never bad either. 
Some things on the menu are very good, some are just OK. 
Prices are pretty moderate, and decor/ambience is very nice though. 
All in all it's a decent place to go...  I still think it's the best restaurant in the mall though!"}
{"text":"This place my friends is not hidden and stands out within the area of the Yorkdale mall. I went their with my team during lunch time. The service was exceptional and our server was very pleasant and friendly. The service was good, food came out warm, we were greeted at the gate and were checked once the food was being eaten. The washrooms were phenomenal as were the chandeliers in the restaurant, I think that's the reason for high prices. 

I ordered their Herb Crush Salmon. The huge and heavy plate came with a very small portion of grilled Skuna Bay salmon, beurre blanc ( \"white butter\" ), a crispy mashed potato (in a spring roll), small vegetables. The food was presented very well and it was was quite enjoyable but you will have to go grab something light later on as it won't fill you up at all.

All I can say it was a pleasant experience and that what you pay for."}
{"text":"I have been to this Joey location many times and it was always good. Park underground for free. it is faster and easy to get to the restaurant. They have low calorie options (at least 3) which helps me keep my diet and enjoy too. I often order the their Maki roll without the creamy sauce on top. it is not a big guys portion but you can share an appetizer. The letus wrap is excellent but about 1000 calories. so, share it with two other people and you will be fine. The yam fries is always good. i have tried other dishes like Salmon rice bowl, tuna salad, etc. and everything was good. the service at the Joey Yorkdale and Joey Eaton are booth excellent."}
{"text":"Big fan of the Joey's Chain - each location I have been to offered great service, ambiance, and food.

I was at Yorkdale this past Saturday to take advantage of the Holt's %15 gift card promo, needless to say, it was an absolute zoo. After only about an hour at Holts, my parents and I were hungry. I wanted to try the new Joey's and so were lucky that when we arrived at the restaurant, there was a lovely corner table at the bar area. I actually prefer the bar/lounge area as you get advantage of high ceilings and it's a comfortable environment to be in.

The one thing that was different about this location was the hostess asked if were all above 19 because we would be seated in the bar area. My parents were really happy about that comment...

We had a very smiley waitress, and I was sad to see that Joey's no longer serves the Antinori red by the glass. 

Food was great - it hit the spot. My dad especially liked the sushi roll for his appetizer which is done fusion style. His main was a rich Spaghetti with meatballs (which I took home for lunch the next day!) I had the Salmon - you can get lunch portion or dinner portion - the difference being the sides that come with the plate.

Overall, great addition to Yorkdale. Better than Milestones and Pickle Barrel (is it even still there?) by FAR and because the food court is such a ZOO, Joey's brings a touch of tranquility."}
{"text":"There's just something about Joey's that keeps me coming back. Be it the atmosphere, the decor, the food or the service, I'm always impressed through and through.

It's become a staple for my friends and I when we want to celebrate a special occasion. The place itself is quite spacious with two floors, the lower being more of a bar dining area. 

I highly recommend the lettuce wraps. It's a great appetizer and absolutely scrumptious. The steak & sushi is terrific as well. 

More memories will be made here in the future, without a doubt.

When"}
{"text":"First time at Joeys Yorkdale
Sure it looks good.
Sure the staff are great looking and friendly.
Too bad the food is way below par.
Ordered calamari on waitress suggestion assuring us they were lightly battered
Au contrare, they were miniscule overly battered and tres greasy.
It was accompanied by battered asparagus. Too bad the kitchen staff don't know enough to cut off the woody end of the asparagus
Then had baja fish tacos thinking I would have a light healthy meal
The fish is more like a deepfried salty greasy sponge STAY AWAY
Save your hard earned dollars.
BTW wife came home with cramps after dinner."}
{"text":"If I am at Yorkdale Mall during the lunch or dinner hours, JOEY Yorkdale would be my number one spot to go to. It's strange how the restaurant does not have accessibility from inside the mall and is completely separated away since you have to walk outside. The bottom floor is where there bar and lounge seating is while the top floor is for dining seating. 

I usually order the Ahi Tuna Tacos to start and it never disappoints. The taco shells are very fragile and after one bite, everything was a complete mess as the hard shell taco that holds everything crumbles apart. The wasabi sauce goes very well with the tacos. Highly recommend these though.

For lunch, I usually get the California Chicken sandwich with fries. If you want salad or soup, you have to add on an extra $2. The texture of the bun for the sandwich was soft yet crispy. The chicken was quite moist and the cheese and other condiments complement the sandwich well. I felt that fries had good potato flavour. I usually need to ask the server for more ketchup because they usually don't give me enough.

From multiple visits, service is a hit or miss. Some servers provide great service while others lack a little bit as they would forget to get more hot water when we asked for it or take a long time to get the bill.

Overall, I would come back here for lunch as the setting is quite nice and there is adequate lighting on the second floor."}
{"text":"Love this place. Went there for a girls night so we just ordered lots of appetizers and some desserts.  We had the sweet potato fries amazing.  Also the flat bread which was tasteful and shrimp lettuce wraps.  All a ten.  We went at a busy time so the place was hopping.  We had a great time with great ambiance"}
{"text":"I was really excited to visit JOEY @ Yorkdale after hearing all the rave reviews about the place. Friends had vouched for it claiming it was the favourite place to visit since it opened with the new wing of Yorkdale Mall...

It's a shame they hire their staff solely on their looks and neglect the fact that server needs to be attentive, and customer focused. Their staff match the venue: aesthetically pleasing but lacking in any sort of content. 

You who read my reviews regularly know that for me to give a place a 1 star means two things: 1) Something must have gone terribly wrong, and 2) I will not return here (and will encourage others to do the same).

So what set me off? What event transpired that ruined my dining experience and relegated JOEY to the land of my rare 1 stars? Allow me to elaborate...

Meeting a friend for lunch we were seated in the lounge area. I ordered a water and my friend ordered a Pepsi. We were having a great conversation when I noticed that the side of the glass I have been sipping from was smeared with Lipstick. Not a huge deal. Gross. But easily fixable - so I thought.

Our server, who for the most part was un-attentive for the majority of our meal, finally stopped by to check in on us. At which point I referred to my glass and asked our server to switch it for a clean one. Her response after picking up the glass to inspect it over dramatically and close (as if to infer she didn't believe me) was \"Oh it's only Lipstick...it's not going to hurt you. But if it's that big a deal I can replace it.\"

I insisted, she rolled her eyes grabbed the glass with a curt impatience and walked off. Once she returned with my glass I noticed that it was not a NEW glass merely the same one with the same chip in the same spot - merely wiped down. Disgusted I figured to further this point would have earned me more of the same service, so I decided to drop it and go without my water. 

For my meal I ordered the Beach Salad which was made with several kinds of lettuce, goat cheese, strawberries, candied pecans and a grilled chicken breast. While the salad tasted fantastic and the chicken was grilled and seasoned to perfection... I now know what the1/2's on their menu mean, must have something to do with protein size because for $17 I received a 1/4 breast of excellently seasoned grilled chicken breast. 

Don't think I will return willingly, I hold a place like this to a higher standard and with staff like that working the floor I don't see any reason why this chain restaurant deserves any more of my business. 

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Excellent dumplings, sampled the steamwissle beer before ordering . Service excellent at the bar and staff very friendly.
Would return no problem."}
{"text":"I always have a good time here. Service and ambience can't be beat! Their food  is fantastic  and I've pretty much tried  their entire menu! Their  bacon cheddar burger is probably one of the best burgers I've ever had! Ahi tuna is also worth ordering.  Sometimes it gets busy and their is a wait but it's  worth  sticking  around"}
{"text":"Really great decor and ambiance, wait staff very knowledgeable in regards to the menu and food preparation. Food was really good, had the chicken fettuccine Alfredo and baked apple pie for dessert. I'm removing one star because I didn't get a pasta spoon with my meal, nor did they offer fresh ground pepper (pepper grinder on the table) or cheese. Overall though a great meal."}
{"text":"I came to Yorkdale last night for dinner with my friends. The service and food was perfect. Everyone loved their meal. I ordered the Cobb Salad and it was so good! Definitely will reorder this again.

The only things to take note was the lobster ravioli was small, the tacos don't come with a side, and the steak/sushi would be great with a side salad -  I would ordering a side salad or fries for these items."}
{"text":"Two stars for ambiance. Another hype trendy spot.  Good social spot especially if your already in the mall.  Food is not mind blowing. But if your gonna order get the baha tacos.  Side note: all the servers are hot girls. They won't hire you unless your a size triple zero.  And I must say, service was amazing!!!

July 19 2015
Went to joeys again. Same deal. Place is pretty and the girls are all a size zero in a tight dress with pretty faces. Appearances aren't everything. Food looked a little too picture perfect but lacks in flavour and authenticity. I got the rainbow sushi and shrimp lettuce rolls. Service wasn't consistent either."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at Joeys. First time had a great experience. Welcomed by Rachel. She recommended the fish tacos. They were amazing . Sampled the house wine ordered another glass. Great choices Rachel and Great service from Christian . We will be   back.  Thanks!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent!!! Nothing else to say. Just great service and food. I'm from Los Angeles and I wish we had this service and quality of food here."}
{"text":"Joey is my chain restaurant of choice. I have been to this location and the one by Eaton centre and they are both consistently good. 

I found the service at this location to be better. 

I like the dark wood decor. Rustic with a modern edge. 

The menu is interesting with well thought out flavour combinations. 

Today I had:
The chicken lettuce wraps with quinoa instead of crispy noodles - yum!
The 500 salad with tuna sashimi - this was outstanding! 
I paid extra for the tuna sashimi, it was well worth it. This salad is a combo of barley, quinoa, mint, parsley, fresh veggies and avocado. I had a balsamic dressing on the side, but it comes with a french vinaigrette. I was really happy to find a salad at a chain restaurant that wasn't loaded with cheese and bacon and other fattening ingredients. This was legit healthy and oh so tasty. 

Joey is a cut above the average chain restaurant. Try it!"}
{"text":"Just finished a bite to eat and glass of wine while waiting for a GO bus at Yorkdale. Very impressed with the standard and care of service from my bartender Joey. My french dip sandwich was also prepared well. I will definitely come back to sit at the bar!"}
{"text":"Arrived for lunch, after 5 minutes got seated. Service was good, waiting time for the food being served was pretty long, fries was already cold, baby back ribs was not juicy at all, burger was just ok, overall disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"I always wanted to try this place because everyone I know had a pretty good experience. I went here on a Thursday night with a friend. We did have approximately a 40 minute wait, but being located beside a mall ... 40 minutes swung by. I was impressed by our waitress Alexndra more than anything. It was a busy night but she checked up on us regularly.  She also gave me some samples of beer because I wasn't sure what I wanted to have. She spent time explaining the steaks to my friend who was indecisive about what she would want. Having a waitress that spent her time on us although it was busy, definitely made it a positive experience.  

Our food was pretty good as well. Large portions for a reasonable price. I got a chicken burger that was quite juicy and delicious. My friend got the blue cheese steak medium rare, the bite I had tasted pretty good. 

Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"I was a big fan of Joey. I picked Joey for most of my gathering, date night and even my wedding after party. 
However I just spent my very first Valentine's  Day with my husband after our recent marriage and I got very disappointed. Salmon was my favourite dish from the menu before. However the waitress didn't even mention the menu has been changed since the new year. The new herb crush salmon is not what I had before and it's not what I expected at all. Salmon is lack of favour and the sauce is way too sour. I am very upset.
For the dessert, can you believe it used to be 7.5 dollar and now it's 9.5 dollars?! I was shocked.

I guess only good side is burger still tastes as awesome as before.
As a regular customer of Joey, I would expect the waitress at least can explain what has been changed in the menu or in the dish. 
What a awful Valentine's dinner"}
{"text":"This place is super pretentious.  To be honest, the more I come here, the more this restaurant disappoints me... The only reason I keep returning must be for birthday celebrations, anniversaries... by people who don't know of better restaurants in the city and who want to keep it local.

The last time I visited JOEY I ordered their Calamari Fritti, which was less than impressive.  Soggy and OILY to say the least... and for the price, we barely got any calamari.

On to the Baja fish tacos-- these bad boys could be behind the awful illness (and puking) I experienced that very night after my meal.  Too floury, no taste, very bland (and probably salmonella?)

I will say that their Chicken Lettuce Wraps are not bad.. a little on the saltier side, but nevertheless, edible.

I think the next time I visit JOEY, it will be strictly for the wine."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday at around 8.30pm and they are about 3/4 full, we are seated upstairs but we kind of have to shift the tables together to accommodate out party of 6 with no assistance from the staff.

We sit down and are greeted by a young lad who takes our drink orders of 6 x glasses of water, a Coor's light, a peach vodka and tonic and a Mill St Organic. The waters came, then the drinks (brought by somebody else) and they were a Mill St Amber, a weird cocktail and the Coor's. We sent back the wrong drinks and got something else.

Somebody else then came to take our food order, she was nice, big smiles, seemed happy to be serving us. We ordered. I had the steak and sushi, the steak was great and the sushi was just OK but 2 of the girls at the table ordered the beach salad which was supposed to have goat cheese but didn't so we had to get a side of that and my fiancé had the French dip which she really enjoyed. Unfortunately, nobody asked us how our meal was until I had finished mine and my late was taken away shortly after.

All in all, it was an average experience, nothing stood out as being really bad nor did anything make me want to go back, or recommend it. The staff are nice, but are either not too bright or not trained very well.
There are too many people serving each table which creates a distinct lack of communication.

Food 6/10 
Drinks 7/10 - it's hard to get 2 beers wrong
Service 4/10 - they did get 2 beers wrong"}
{"text":"ended up here on a total whim w/ my bf last night. we had the yam fries to share and ordered our respective entrees. he had the steak & sushi and i had the ravioli w/ crispy proscuitto, shrimp & tomatoes (without the capers, as i'm not a massive fan of them). 
suffice to say that we LOVED everything we ordered and we were amazed at how well all the flavours just blended so perfectly together. the portion size is actually perfect for our liking and for us, it was money well spent. 
i think it's safe to say we definitely look forward to returning to JOEY (whether at Don Mills or Yorkdale) at sometime in the near future."}
{"text":"This space is my favourite of all their Toronto area locations. Two great floors, patio and lots of windows to let the sunshine in. 

The food is typical chain restaurant fair, but better than most. Love how they've started to feature craft beers at reasonable prices. I had the Muskoka Detour on tap and enjoyed it. 

Our table ordered the following: 

Fish taco: Presented and tasted well. 

Blackened chicken sandwich: Decent portion size. Meh! Not bad but didn't blow anyone away. 

Steak and Sushi: great presentation. Sushi was delicious. Be warned, the steak was cut into strips and presented in a bowl with a wasabi based coating. We thought we were getting a 4oz piece of meat. Steak was meh. 

Overall, it's a great place to hang out after work or rest after a busy day of shopping at Yorkdale."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night around 7 pm, and had to wait 2 hours to get a table. 

Other than the long line though, everything else went smoothly. Service was good and we got out food shortly after ordering. All the workers made some great recommendations and was definitely working hard despite the busy night. Some of the things we wanted however finished.  Alot of items were more on the pricey side, I would say around 20-30$. Not a lot of vegetarian options but alot of customization was available.

The food we got was delicious and filling. The portion size was great. They gave the best ratios in terms of sides and mains.

At Joey's, their menu is super customizable for anyone with a vegetarian diet. This dish actually comes with chicken, however they customized it for me to add soy instead, and honestly I couldn't taste the difference. The dish itself was wonderful. The curry was both sweet with a bit of spice, and not too thick. It had a mix of soy chicken, peppers and zuchinni. It made it perfect to dip with the provided soft naan bread and the delicious baslma rice. 

Their Vege burger was ridiculously good. Super comforting. Filling. The vege bun is crisp to perfection. I would skip the fries though, wasn't the biggest fan"}
{"text":"After swearing off JOEY Yorkdale, SURPRISE, we went back.  This time our experience was much better.  We were seated promptly and our waiter was extremely nice.  Our food came REALLY quickly and it was quite good.

I ordered the same sandwich as last time, and I swear it was bigger.  My boyfriend had a burger and also enjoyed it.  The only downfall this time was that he was never given cutlery or a napkin and we had to steal it from another table.

Maybe it was growing pains or maybe I had an off time, but this time around it was fairly good and we left content."}
{"text":"Nice place to have a break after shopping crazily in Yorkdale=?

Superfood 500 is the very good choice if you like quinoa and rotisserie chicken. And the salad is only 500 calories

Steak and sushi is quite an excellent fusion dish mixed with prime steak and oriental sushi. Ponzu sauce tastes surprisingly matched with the steak. Good to try!

My favorite is Pan-roasted Mushroom Pasta. It is double smoked bacon, peas, crispy shallots, garlic cream sauce. It is a little bit salty but very flavorful. I like the double smoked bacon as well as the mushroom.

I think Joey did a very great job in making fusion dishes."}
{"text":"I went to this place last night and it was super busy. I was meeting a friend and she had waited almost an hour for our table prior to me getting there. The service was good, the waiter checked in with us a lot but I think they were maybe trying to get us out quicker because it was so busy. The food was really awful in my opinion. I had the Chili chicken app and it was nothing special, just ok. I've had better food at the keg or even moxies for sure. Also my entree came and I ordered the chicken fettuccine Alfredo. The portion size was ok but the pasta was bland and I found the noodles were undercooked and I've had way better pasta at east side marios. I also ordered the jack and Coke drink with lime slush and it was mediocre and way over priced. This place isn't worth the wait, go to the keg or moxies instead."}
{"text":"Hit or Miss depending on how busy they are!

I have been there before when they are overwhelmingly busy and the servers are all over the place and sometimes have a bad attitude. I even had to call the manager once on a girl who rolled her eyes at me.

However last night, their service was exceptional. Since we were waiting to be served, the bartender came over and offered beverage samples before we ordered our drinks. Then the server came and described the item on the menu so well that I almost knew what it tasted like. Royalty treatment.

I ordered the tandoori flatbread. OMG. It tasted like BBQ..it tasted like indian food...it tasted like pizza....it tasted like a sandwich....ummm...what is this sorcery???The flat bread had a similar texture as a pizza hut crust but however it was way more flakey. Almost like a fritter.

I think I found my go to item when I come to Joey's. 

P.S - The benilli wasn't bad in between the big choice of premium beers they had!

I will go on nights when it is not busy!!!"}
{"text":"This place is really really nice! I came here for a drink and had their rotissiere chicken special that came with veggies and potatoes.  It was delicious and WORTH crossing the road for!  You can definitely bet that the chicken is moist and juicy! Service was wonderful and we sat in the 500 section upstairs and the booze were flowing perfectly!

Make sure you park near the spot as the entrance is outside and not connected to the mall. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I'm really stuck between a 3 and 4 star review but for the reasons you'll see below, I'll leave it at a 4 for amazing customer service. 

Since the last time I came in November, I believe that the menu had slightly changed. 

When we first got upstairs, we got our water immediately but took a while for someone to come take our order which is understandable because it seemed as if they were short staffed but I believe the managers were helping out. She noticed that I was a bit irritated looking for someone to take our order so she came and took our order and gave us exceptional service giving us a breakdown of what was in the dishes and making sure we didn't have allergies and would be okay with the flavours in the dishes. 

We had the calamari to start, which from what I remember was a lot smaller portion than before which is a little disappointing but still tasted good. 

I initially got the ahi tuna club which was described to be seared and rare in the menu (as it should be) but as I took a bite out of it, the tuna was definitely over cooked. I brought it up to one of the servers and maybe that's just how JOEY cooks their tuna and so he said he'd ask the chef for me. He then came back to tell me it was supposed to be like this and then shined his flashlight saying that it was probably just too dark but as someone who eats a lot of sushi and fish, there was barely any pink to the tuna. I really didn't want to keep eating that dish and I ended up just asking if I could get a new dish which they allowed. 

I ended up getting the ravioli with lobster cream and prawns which was delicious. A lot better than the ahi tuna. Multiple people including a manager I believe then came up to me asking if this was a lot better, asking if I needed anything else. At the end, the server that showed the dish to the chef was then making small talk with me and agreed that the tuna was a bit over cooked and was very friendly. 

Usually when something like this happens, the service tends to go down as it causes more work to them which I totally understand but Kudos to JOEY for treating their customers well."}
{"text":"I have to admit I was a bit nervous coming here because of it's reputation for poor service, but I was pleasantly surprised how good my experience here was. 

The ambiance is nice, the service was great, and the food came out crazy fast. 

I had the butter chicken and my GF had the roast chicken, and both were really good! They also had key lime pie which I don't see very much in Toronto, and it was awesome too! The pie was a good portion, thick crust, and tons of whipped cream. It was perfect. 

The dining options at Yorkdale kind of disappoint me, even Jamie's was not very good. I now consider this the best place to eat at Yorkdale and even in the immediate neighbourhood(tied with burger priest down the street). I would come back just for the Key lime pie."}
{"text":"Had a really horrible experience at the Yorkdale Joey last night.  Let me start off by saying that I'd been to the Don Mills Joey last summer and had a very pleasant time with good food and great service.  Last night's dining experience at Yorkdale was the worst I have ever experienced.  I'll just sum up.

First, we asked our server specifically about the condiments on the burger, and we both said we did not want pickles and wanted blue cheese.  Both burgers came with pickles, and one came with cheddar instead of blue cheese.

The only utensils offered to us was a lonely fork given to my daughter, who ordered fettuchine.  Oh, we had one napkin for all of us, and I had to ask for napkins.

Not once did our server come by and offer us a drink refill.  We had to flag down another server to ask for refills.

When dinner was over, the server whisked away our dishes, and our napkins.  We ordered dessert, and it took fully 30 minutes for the two desserts to arrive.  With the desserts, we got 4 spoons and  . . . one napkin.  Ok, we had to ask for more napkins . . . again.

Probably the worst service I've had in my history of dining.  Food was ok but certainly not worth the wait or the poor service.  

I recommend not going to Joey Yorkdale."}
{"text":"Love this place 
The crowd is always good , upstairs in great 
Food is fantastic 

For appetizer i normally will either get calamari anywhere, but here the tandoori chicken flatbread is so so good and flavourful, its a must try. 

Joeys is my go to place normally for sudden steak cravings specially because its the only place that cooks the veggies half decent and not dry, and the CRISPY MASHED POTATO in the spring roll is everything 

I have another favourite , being the pan roasted mushroom pasta. SO GOOD! many say its a tad salty but ive always loved my food salty and this just has all the right flavours in it. Love love love. 

Drinks r great and from what i can remember our servers have always been very attentive and friendly. 

Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I went there with my friends for dinner. The food was great, but the server wasn't. As i work in the food industry I have a higher standard when it comes to hospitality. The server was too distracted with the girls sitting on another table, it got to the point of him sitting down with them and having a good time. We ended up having someone else taking care of us for a while until the people from the other table left."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to Joey's Yorkdale, and both times my expectations for the food and service were exceeded. Actually, the service this time was fantastic. Our server was extremely attentive, paid close attention to allergies and offered to let us sample our cocktails before actually purchasing a glass, just to be sure we would be happy with the drinks. When a friend unexpectedly arrived to join us for drinks they quickly accommodated us at a larger table mid-meal. 
We ordered fried calamari to start (super crispy and delicious with a spicy aioli sauce), I had the Steak Frites, which was perfectly cooked, though slightly small at 5ounces. My companion had the salmon bowl which she absolutely loved and was happy she had ordered in place of the grilled salmon. For desert we had the apple pie, which me easily shared between the three if us. The meal was heavy yet satisfying. 
The only thing that bothers me is sitting upstairs next to the open concept kitchen means you have a lot of good odours to accompany your meal. My dress smelled like food as well. 
They have a bar area, dining room and lounge area, and had various games playing on big screens around the restaurant. 
Overall a great place for a chic, yet casual night out."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Joey's (more so their Eaton Centre location, not so much the Don Mills one).  I'm a fan of the food, and usually the staff. I've been to this location maybe 4 or 5 times, and most of them were pleasant ones. The only not-so-nice experience was the one (and only) time I went for lunch with some girlfriends. Our server was really nice, but was helped out a few times by another server (who was not friendly at all). This server didn't like a girl at our table (because she asked a question that I can't remember, but it wasn't rude - just maybe a little dumb?) and would very obviously go over to the bartenders and talk about her while looking at our table.

The food also wasn't as good as it usually is... so I guess my whole point is: don't go for lunch?

Dinner has always been great - honorable dinner mentions:
Apps:
- ahi tuna tacos
- calamari
- yam fries
- spinach dip
- gyoza

Mains
- butter chicken
- filet mignon (the fully-loaded crispy mash is amazing!)
- grilled salmon

Desserts (these change from time to time)
- italian donuts
- apple pie"}
{"text":"I had the steak and frites, and I ate everything on the plate. It was so good!
The combination between the salty fries, the juicy steak with parsley butter, and arugula was just perfect. I'm not a picky eater and the bartender (I was seated at bar area) was kind enough to ask if I would like to take the arugula or the parsley off my order, but I didn't. One thing though, the steak size may be a little bit too small.
I asked for the bartender recommendation for the wine pairing and he recommended Malbec to me. It was a good wine by itself but I guess the arugula after taste sort of mess with the taste afterwards.
Nevertheless, it was still a good experience. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Slowest service ever. Other locations ive been to were way better!  We waited to order for 30 min and waited another 45 min for the order to arrive. Then waited for our dessert order for another 20 min. And the bill took forever to arrive!"}
{"text":"Me and my Dad went for lunch and we ordered the pressed sushi and the classic burgers. The service was great! The food has always been great everytime we go. We had never been to this location and the inside looked stunning. I would 100% reccommend the pressed sushi and to try the burgers."}
{"text":"Food is average.Too many waitresses but service is slow took almost 30 minutes to refill our drinks.To make my story short,i think the place is overrated ."}
{"text":"Went to Joey for a girls get together and didn't love it.  Had sliders for an appetizer and lettuce wraps for the main.  The chicken lettuce wraps were great, the girls that ordered the shrimp lettuce wraps were disappointed over the small shrimp.  The sliders were really good.  It was so loud that it was hard to have a conversation.  They seated us right in front of the open kitchen which made it extra loud and by the end of our meal we felt we needed to go scrub down from the smell of the kitchen."}
{"text":"I had the spinach and artichoke ravioli with prawns during a fairly busy Wednesday evening. I dined alone, as I usually do on business trips, but I found the atmosphere pretty chill. The food was fantastic. Very rich, but not overly so. Kind of pricey if you're hoping for large portions, but if you can make a meal out of a small handful of bites, you won't notice. I would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, I think Joey's is one of the few that is quite good. It's what Milestones strived to be back in the early 00's. It's classy, great customer service, an all round all times good dining experience for all ages, with good quality food and value.  For a mall restaurant, I would definitely choose Joey's over any of the other choices at Yorkdale (Casey's, Pickle Barrel (why is this even still around), Milestones). 

I dislike chain restaurants, but this one I would come back to again. 

I've been to both the Yorkdale and Eaton Centre locations, and both times, was surprised at the attentiveness, and smiley shiny faces that constantly asked me \"how was the food\" and \"thank you for dining with us\" to the point it got annoying but I fully appreciated it, and would rather this than the opposite.

Lots on the menu to choose and portion size is good. Lobster Grilled Cheese is my favourite. 

The atmosphere is classy enough to bring your parents, but down to earth enough to share a meal with your friends. It's perfect for the location."}
{"text":"So this Joey location was the first one I ever visited a few years ago. I was not a fan of the food or service. I came back a few weeks ago to meet with an old friend only because I gave Joey Sherway a chance and I loved their baja fish tacos. This time around the waitress almost spilled my sangria and her fingers ended up in the drink and then asked me if I wanted another one. Obviously! You guys still need improvement"}
{"text":"I've been to Joey Yorkdale half a dozen times. I've visited Eaton Centre and Shops On Don Mills locations at least a dozen times. I have to applaud the consistency, especially of the food. This time we had the Dragon Roll, Sushi Cones, Tandoori Chicken Flatbread, Tuna Sashimi Salad and a side of Crispy Mashed Potatoes (a must have and my ultimate favourite comfort food!). Only a few minor gripes.  Our table was sticky and had stains on it and we had to ask the server to wipe it. The Tuna Sashimi Salad was a touch too acidic for my liking but the under-ripe mangoes may have contributed to it and the flatbread was barely Luke warm.  Service was great and spot on, good timing for the arrival of the food and the the food tasted great as usual. Only item I would advise steering away from is the Lobster Grilled Cheese. Sounds great but lacks lobster flavour. All in all, Joey usually provides a consistent food and service experience and never disappoints."}
{"text":"Well I went to this restaurant just for a nice casual dinner. My father decided for an appetizer to order chicken wings. Well I have eaten at the best wing places in the world and believe it or not, aside from their size they were amazing. They were as good as duffs wings house in buffalo if not better. The one complaint that I have towards this restaurant is we paid and extra 1$ for the sweet potato fries. Sadly the size of the froze you for was smaller than regular. I was practically paying money for less. Overall really good nothing got sent back to the kitchen and everything was to my liking."}
{"text":"I quite liked this location. I recently completed the feedback via a link I received on the receipt of my last visit and I explained that I was a bit unhappy that I was charged for a birthday dessert, and client relations invited me to come back to try once more with some incentive so I did so today. Beautiful light fixtures  
and the hostess took the time to explain them to me including the artist and where they came from. She was knowledgeable and very friendly and took the time to start a conversation which I really enjoyed. The food was delicious and fresh and came quite quickly. The atmosphere on a Wednesday night was not busy or crowded, tables have ample space between them and you don't feel like you're dining with your neighbour, and the lighting is dimmed which is so much easier on the eyes in my opinion. We got appetizers (hot wings - delicious), drinks (Caesar and blueberry mojito - refreshingly simple and taste great), entrées (veg burger and rotisserie chicken entrée - fresh and delicious) and of course dessert (chocolate soufflé - beautiful combinations of complimentary flavours and temperature). Overall, our server Renée was lovely and quick, and we had a great experience tonight. Always a favourite"}
{"text":"Joey's shoud not permit adults to offload their children to a separate table (10 of them) to misbehave and disrupt the lunch of the other patrons in the restaurant. In the Western world, we don't eat because we're starving, and we don't eat in restaurants because we can't find food anywhere else. We're paying over the top prices for the restaurant ambience...

And, they should have responsed faster to our request to move tables away from this horde, before we had to insisit upon it"}
{"text":"First time here and we're very impressed!
The restaurant decor was stunning and the size was massive! We were impressed! 
All of the staff was really on the ball, as we watched them work their butts off serving, going up and down the stairs....
The food was absolutely delicious!
And the presentation was wonderful.
The only loss of star was due to OUR waiter who was very forgetful, didn't visit us, we had to wave him down a few times (which we don't like doing) our wine arrived AFTER DINNER WAS SERVED... 
and he forgot to bring the bill which again we sat and waited for and eventually eaves him down again..."}
{"text":"I celebrated my belated bday with two of my closest friends. It was a last minute decision so we didn't make any reservations beforehand so the wait was 45mins, no big deal, we just roamed the mall until it was time. 
We ordered a round of drinks, lettuce wraps as appetizer, and steak frites, Spanish paella, and ravioli as our main. I prefer my steak medium but last time I was at Joey, it was over cooked so this time I asked for medium rare thinking that it would be over cooked again and to my surprise, it was cooked to a perfect medium rare! 
The food was great but the service was lacking. We barely saw our server and she forgot our lettuce wrap. We asked someone else about it and he apologized and said he would look into it but he never came back lol. 

Overall, decent place. I'll probably come back when someone suggests it otherwise I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. If I want non existent service, I can just go to the food court."}
{"text":"Very nice design
Nice and cozy seting
Do not order the steak
It is expensive, not sophisticated and does not taste like it should be with it's price tag.
The chicken was a bit to salty for my daughter's taste.
Overall pricey restaurant that does not deliver."}
{"text":"I absolutely enjoyed dining here on my last visit.  I always wish that my work meetings are held here.  The food is most excellent for a chain restaurant.  I had the salmon, lobster ravioli pasta and it was so scrumptious.  I could not decide on what to order and asked the server what her preference is.  She then provided me with the entire ingredients and explained the taste.  Wow, was I impressed!  She then proceeded to provide a brief summary of each dish ordered by the entire table!  One of my companions could not decide on what type of beer to order, so the server brought beer tasting glasses to the table.  Nice.  I am giving this place a 4.5, because the highlight was the very knowledgeable server.  Altough, i must admit, if I did not get her as a server, I would not have written this raving review (I would give it a four).  The food is delicious, but what stands out in my mind is this very knowledgeable and pleasant server!"}
{"text":"Great food but poor service. 3 different times I revived poor service at this Yorkdake location. I brought my parents and friends and they were very disappointed, it was that bad ..... 

The time I went with my parents our waters and drinks took forever, food came late, order was wrong & on top of that we realized it wasn't just our table that was getting screwed over, it was the whole damn section !!!  How does that happen in an upscale restaurant that's suppose to have a good rep!? I was embarrassed that i brought  my parents here lol ...

Anyways, only the male servers were serious about their job meaning they provided good customer service. On the other hand, a handful of the girls that got hired was CLEARLY for looks and not skill :) 

So sad. But I'll rate this a 3, even though it should be 2, only because the food and drinks were on point."}
{"text":"Joey has some delicious food and this location is no exception. Come before the mall closes (everyone will rush here after shopping) they will get your phone number and you can continue shopping around until they call you (great idea)

The place has a great amount of seats, the decor is nice and chic, enough parking at the new parking lot inside yorkdale mall. 

I tried most of the dishes already and there isn't one that I did not enjoy. I really like the yam fries, tuna salad and dessert! The dessert menu is limited but each and everyone of them is so good that they don't even need a bigger dessert menu. For drinks, the blueberry mojito is two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Im giving Joeys at yorkdale a 3/5 stars for a few relevant reasons. Had these things have transpired differently I would have given it a 5 stars for sure.
Sweet and simple.
The atmosphere is pretty laid back and the vibe upstairs is more high end dining when compared to the average mall eatery. That being said, the table that we had selected in the back wasn't cleaned as yet and so we were more so compelled to sit at another,  not so interpersonal table (this was a business lunch so seclusion would have been ideal). Although that may seem simple, the hostess just brushed it off and didn't bother to apologize for the inconvenience.  

The server who  1st took our orders was just as clueless about the dishes on the menu. She never bothered to introduce herself either. I ended up having to go on yelp to see pictures other patrons had uploaded. Again, no helpful information,  or an apology from the servers.

The food took forever to come out. About 30 mins and the house wasnt even 40% occupied.  

I ordered the steak and sushi. The presentation was 100% sublime. I almost didnt want to ruin it. I also had a 6 oz glass of reisling to top it off. Steak was salty but perfectly cooked. The sushi, although the fish was so fresh it was springy to touch, was bland. 
Portion sizes are great based on other dishes I saw being served as well as the one I got. 

The server cleared away my board and snatched my husband's drink away and he wasnt even done.  No questions asked.  The whole time the three or so different people serving us were just zombies. It was awkward. 

We even had to ask for waters. Crying shame.

I probably would give this place another shot but I dont know if it would be my first choice. Prices are reasonable as well so perhaps that may determine how soon I conclude my decision to get a sophomore meal here.
Ceasar starter
6 oz reisling
Steak and sushi platter
Iced tea
$50 after tax :)"}
{"text":"Most of the times a very long wait is expected but it's well worth it. Atmosphere and decor is pretty good but their choice of music so not suitable for the style of restaurant they are trying to prompt. 
Food never disappoints. It's always fresh and tasty. 
Service is always good and professional. 
Recommended!

{"text":"top two dishes:
- ahi tuna tacos
- crispy mashed potatoes
SOO good and unique. 

Service is good, attentive and quick. Their reservation system online is quite useful, make sure you book ahead on the site or call in before you go, they can save you seats.

The portion size is average, the food is consistent, never really had a bad experience with Joey's. The price is a little above average."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Joey that I've been to in Toronto - simply because the service is excellent (the food is great all around)! I had the New York Steak which comes with seasonal vegetables and crispy mash. Honestly this is one of my favourite meals ever!!!! The steak here is sooo tasty. The restaurant is two levels and absolutely stunning inside! Definitely recommend :)"}
{"text":"Good Food and service! I had the roasted chicken with the daily sauce. I believe it was a mushroom based sauce, and although I do not like mushroom, I very much liked this sauce."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch yesterday with old friends.  Everyone was happy with what they ordered. Service was great! We tried the lettuce wrap with crispy chicken for starters and it was tasty. I ate the burger with fries and that was also good. My friend liked her paella. Servings were generous.  We shared raspberry mousse for dessert and that was good. My friend ordered this watermelon drink for $10, he said it was delicious but way too much ice in it."}
{"text":"All in all i was very pleasantly surprised. Ive been to this franchise a couple of times before and it was just ok and felt overpriced and stuffy for what it was.  But the few dishes we had over the weekend were quite tasty and worth considering another visit. 

The Baja fish tacos were alright. Nothing to really write home about, but i thoroughly enjoyed the yam fries (good dip!), lobster ravioli, and mushroom pasta. 

Although we arrived for prime time Saturday night dinner, they were able to seat us (table for 6) at the social section, and then moved us to a table that happened to just open up. Maybe we just got lucky. Service was very good too... Just HATE HATE HATE parking at this mall."}
{"text":"1. Fried calamari - soggy and under season.  Felt like they left it sitting 
--- RATE: 4/10 


2. mushroom soup - water down. Bland 
--- RATE 3/10


3. ravioli artichoke with bacon - Ok.  Warm... should be served hot.  It had spicy sauce  coating the tomato OR i wouldn't order it. Should mention THAT in the menu
--- RATE: 6.5/10

My friends were served FLAT coke. Free refills gee... I wonder why since there no fizz

Will I go back? Nope.  One time is enough

Overall:

Food: 4.5/10
Service: 5/ 10 (they forgot our drinks and did not place the plate properly.  You don't hand plate across the table and expect the customer to take it by hand.....  )

Drinks: 3/10  Flat soda, over priced kills the deal"}
{"text":"came here again to give it a second chance, really liked the fish taco, calamari is good too! i like the atmosphere so i guess just have to stick to the few foods i like. 

hubby wasn't too impressed with his steak, burgers are kind of blah as well. 

very attractive waiting staff. fun environment over-all."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and lay out. High end decor and service. Got their lettuce burger and sushi and tasted good. Not the best but definitely worth a try. Will go back to try more stuff on their menu."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place gets a bad rap. I have been here twice with family and enjoyed our appetizers and my meal. I have to be honest the prices are a bit steep but it is really to be expected given the location (Yorkdale).

Last Sunday, my mom and step dad treated me to lunch while I was at work (shh! don't tell anyone I work at the mall lol). 

We ordered the calamari and the artichoke dip to start. The calamari was tasty, not too greasy and not overcooked at all - yay! I personally was not a fan of the artichoke dip and would normally never order that anyway so perhaps I am a bit biased. I just didn't really enjoy the consistency of the dip, too homogenous. I prefer to be able to identify the little chunks of veggies, etc. I did enjoy the tiny salsa that came with the app.

For my main I ordered the herbed salmon with beurre blanc (which I asked for on the side) and it was awesome! The fish was perfectly cooked and I love their little spring roll potato invention. Only tiny issue was that the herb pesto on top was way way too salty, it was like the chef prepared it but did not taste before plating. Luckily I was able to just scrape it off to the side (I didn't really have time to send it back anyway as I was only on a one hour lunch break). My parents both ordered different steaks and were very happy with their meals.

To end we ordered coffees, key lime pie, and a molten chocolate lava cake to share - so good!! I highly recommend ordering the key lime dessert, it was heaven!

Special thanks to our server, Sam, she was very sweet and also very good about rushing the food a bit due to my time constraints.

If you are going to a sit down restaurant at Yorkdale, Joey's is by far your best bet!"}
{"text":"Giving any chain restaurant 5 stars...is a big deal for me. Perfect patio for summer. Got a place on it = 
Order: Ahi tuna salad. Was concerned that it would just be lying on a bed of spring greens, but this was exceptionally well presented and flavored. Ginger, cilantro, crispy noodles, mango chunks mixed with spring greens and artfully presented. A flavor bomb is the only way I can describe this. The Tuna was seared to perfection, and a generous portion to accompany the greens. andOceanWise, a huge deal for me personally.
Key Lime Pie: my dinner partner and I agreed it's the best we've ever had. And I've had Key Lime Pie in the Florida Keys. The filling was fluffy like whipped cream, the texture of custard infused AIR. Absolutely divine. No sticking to the plate, every forkful came apart perfectly from the huge slice."}
{"text":"A great place before, in between or after shopping.  A whole separate gluten free menu.  Beautiful decor.  Elevator for the second floor.  Nice seating.  A little loud but they don't rush u out the door.  Nice bar and dining area.  A great location, a must visit"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Large, attractive, Hip & trendy. Sporty & sheek.
Cleanliness: excellent
Constructive criticism: needs better cleaning near the bar area. The bar equipment gives off a foul smell. Not appealing while you're eating. 
Cuisine: from asian to american to italian
Facilities: great condition. very clean.
Food: excellent! every item on their menu is performed with the highest quality of ingredients and the presentation is very appealing.
Likeliness of returning or recommending to others: will return, will reccomend.
Parking: tedious. in Yorkdale Mall, so be patient and allow extra time.

{"text":"such a letdown. my folks were in town this weekend and wanted a suggestion on where to go for a family dinner (my parents, myself, sister and brother inlaw). We were going to do some shopping in the new addition of Yorkdale so I suggested what seemed like the natural option, the new restaurant in the mall, Joey.
We arrived at 5:30 and were seated promptly. The décor is modern and sharp, and the general atmosphere seemed high end but the attitude of the wait staff contradict that with sub sub par service and generally dull personalities. 
A bar tender came to take our drink orders, which I didn't think odd since she was nice and quick. We waited over 30 minutes before our actual waitress made an appearance to take our orders, then she changes with another girl by the time our food came out. My dad ordered a steak medium well, it came out entirely pink, they got the 2nd round of drinks messed up and each time we wanted a refill or something else, it took about 15 minutes and we had to ask a 2nd time for almost everything.
Before we left I went to the men's room. It was very nice and as with the washrooms in yorkdale mall, the toilet stalls have a small shelf/ledge behind the toilet. It was obvious that a recent patron (perhaps staff) had just done a line of cocaine here because there was residue all over the ledge and you could tell it had been \"chopped\" with a straight edge (nice place for a family dinner)!
Won't be going back, what a shame since this mall deserves a high end eatery. Get the college kids out and the real service in."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here at Joey's, and for good reason.

Amanda at the bar is tops, she knows the menu backwards and forwards, and is
helpful with recommendations, regardless of how busy she is,.

The other staff are equally helpful, and take good care of their clients.

The chef's are on top of their game here.  I have enjoyed many dishes, some that 
I might not have tried, and was pleasantly surprised.

It can get busy most nights, especially if a sports game is on,
so if you don't want to wait an hour or more for a table,
get there early."}
{"text":"Finally tried eating at a JOEY restaurant. I had heard good things about the food and happened to be nearby Yorkdale so my friend and I decided to give it a try for dinner. The place is located right at the corner of the mall, with only an external entrance, which we found odd since it's attached to the mall. The restaurant is very nicely decorated with a gorgeous chandelier and wall fixtures. 

The atmosphere was extremely busy from the moment we stepped into the restaurant. The two front hostesses were busy but one looked up and helped us. She directed us to make our way to the upper dining area. We were greeted right away on the second floor by another hostess who seated us at a 4 seater table by a wall that had large lightbulb decor. We were given menus right away, which I appreciated since we could look it over before our server came to our table. 

Our server did not stop by our table for quite a while. We could see that it was extremely busy, so we mentally prepared ourselves to wait a while to a) place our order and b) to get the food we order. Almost 10 minutes later, a sever named Linda dropped by and take our order, since by then we had already looked over the menu and decided what to get. My friend ordered a coke, since he was very thirsty but our drinks took quite a while to arrive. Despite the initial wait to order and receive our drinks, our server was polite and friendly. We were not too hungry so we split a sushi item and a main dish. We were also pleasantly surprised when the food was brought to our table so quickly, in about 10 minutes, which is the same amount of time it took waiting to place the food order and get our drinks. 

The Hawaiian Sushi Tacos ($13) consisted of 3 tacos made of ahi tuna, fresh avocado, and chili miso sauce on top of sushi rice on a crispy tortilla shell. Initially, we were really surprised as to the size of the dish but realized it was indeed a sushi item and also an appetizer so the small size made sense. What it lacked in size, it made up in flavour. The tacos were very tasty and we loved the contrast in texture between the soft tuna and rice with the crispy taco shell. The Steak & Sushi ($26.50) was a Japanase style surf and turf, with Tataki-style cut steak in a bowl of ponzu sauce and a rainbow roll with ahi tuna, salmon and crab. The rainbow roll was very good and flavourful. The steak was too salty, likely due to the sauce it was marinated with. The texture of the meat was cooked perfectly and was tasty and juicy despite the saltiness. 

The man who delivered our food dishes from the kitchen appeared to be a manager or supervisor. We didn't catch his name but he was very friendly and he also came by later to remove our empty plates. Since he was around and we didn't see our server anywhere, we asked him for our bill. Our server returned to our table with the bill 5 minutes later. We were greeted on the way out by another server and the same manager/supervisor from before, who nicely thanked us for eating at JOEY and wished us a good night. 

My friend was less impressed by the small portion sizes of our food and the overly salty steak, along with the high end prices on the menu. He felt it lacked the flavour and quality to warrant such pricing, though the presentation of food was great. On the other hand, I found the food to be very good and full of flavour but somewhat agreed with his comment about the pricing. Comparable restaurants have bigger portions for the same price or lower. Overall, I'm glad that I got to try the food at JOEY Yorkdale and will be back to try other items, hopefully with a bigger appetite next time."}
{"text":"Joey never disappoints. I love the sushi cone for appetizer and the ahi tuna club is amazing. For those who don't like raw fish, you can ask to have the tuna cooked. For a healthier selection, you can order the ahi tuna salad which is just as delicious. They have crispy mashed potatoes as a side and it's really good. It is basically a spring roll with mashed potatoes and little pieces of bacon and cheddar sprinkled at the top.

It gets extremely busy on the weekends so I would recommend that a reservation is made to avoid having to wait an hour."}
{"text":"I ordered the ahi tuna club and my boyfriend ordered the steak and prawn. We were both very happy and satisfied with our food. The tuna with the sweet relish and the salty and crunchy onion rings and bacon combination in my club was so delicious, the flavours were perfectly combined. The steak was ordered as medium rare but came more on the rare side. It also came with mashed potato spring rolls with sour cream and cheese which was absolutely heavenly! The food is a bit on the pricier side our bill, including 2 drinks, came up to $83."}
{"text":"Boy oh boy. I cannot looks at myself in the mirror after what I did to myself last nite. Once again, Joey disappoints with their menu. I have a strange fixation for veggie burgers in restaurants all thanks to Jack Astors a few years ago. BAM! They were good. Anyhooo....I have to say that if you like the taste of soy flavored sand dripping out from between the buns, go for it. All for the pleasure of $15. The fries were one step up from McCain's quality so congrats to them for that. I give them an extra star because they serve Kronenburg Blanc. Way to go way to go."}
{"text":"You know what, I didn't want to like this place as I'm not a big fan of overly corporate restaurants, but Joey wasn't bad at all. The host at the door was very friendly and seated us within five minutes, our servers were friendly and efficient, and I know that at least the food I had was very enjoyable. Peering right into the kitchen (we were seated on the upper level) was quite neat. I ordered the 500 salad which was suuuper tasty...not sure how they combined such simple, unassuming ingredients as raw cauliflower, mixed greens, quinoa and peacans (as well as a few other ingredients I don't recall) into such an engaging dish! My friend had the chicken alfredo, which he made short work of so I take it that he was pleased with his food as well. The servers were helpful in recommending a drink for me and adjusting it to my preferred level of sweetness. All in all it was a good meal and positive experience, but I guess I'm a bit of a snob for authenticity as I wouldn't come back unless I was struck by crippling hunger mid-shopping trip. I prefer restaurants that aren't moulded to a formula and would rather spend my money at those."}
{"text":"Joeys is hands down my favorite restaurant at Yorkdale Mall! Surrounded by nice decor, a cozy patio, great customer service, and remarkable food - it's not a surprise this spot gets extremely busy on weekends and for lunch. 

They definitely get busy so reservations are recommended if coming in a big group. I have been here several times and been seated in the bar area and patio. I've actually never sat upstairs, but I am sure it's just as wonderful as downstairs. The customer service has also been amazing and they are quick to address any questions/concerns. Joeys is definitely on the finer end spectrum on the list of restaurants in the area and it definitely lives up to that expectation in all aspects. 

Food: the tandoori chicken flatbread is heavenly!!!!! And I have no words to describe the \"steak & sushi\" dish, it is something that just needs to be tried! I'm not a steak fan but I can have this perfectly seasoned Japanese style dish everyday. For drinks, I've tried the classic mojito and peach belinnis - both different and delicious!

Check out this spot if you haven't already and definitely try the steak and sushi!"}
{"text":"Joey in Yorkdale has a great patio section for a mall. There bar has a good selection of beer on tap and the have a good menu. I had the bacon cheese burger and it was one of be the better burgers I've had in the area. With prices similar to Moxies, I would pick this place all the time."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Had to look for a waitress twice and poured my own bottle of wine the entire meal and no one came over to ask how our meal was or if we needed anything else like water!"}
{"text":"My first time to Joeys Yorkdale was a pretty good experience.  Though it was approximately a 30 min wait I received a text advising our table was finally ready.  Firstly this place is busy, and quite spacious due to its popularity. 
The atmosphere has an open concept appeal,  open kitchen on the second floor, plenty of lighting with spacious tables and comfy seating. 

For food we ordered a line up of appetizers:
Schezuan edamame: seasoned lightly and pan-fried  with schezuan seeds 4/5
Pesto shrimp Flatbread: lightly seasoned/ toasted with an aoili topped off grilled shrimp. 4.5/5
Trio dip: smoked cream cheese, hummus & fish patte creme served with toasted Flatbread. 4/5
the service was friendly and efficient in the midst of this crazy foodie environment! 

Would I come back, yes!!!!!!! also its great to see that restaurants are using the new waiting system where they'd take down your cell# and notify you when your table is ready.  good are those days of carrying around that vibrating device that had a 500 metre radius.. hahaha..good job!"}
{"text":"I come to Joey's ALL the time. All my friends have really grown to love Joey's, whether its Joey Yorkdale or Joey Eaton Centre. But there's something special about the Yorkdale location. 
The service is friendly and pretty fast too.
Food is excellent. I'm craving it right now!
I'll make sure we come back soon."}
{"text":"I'm conflicted by Joeys. 

I've been to their first Toronto location at Shops at Don Mills many times, I even hosted a birthday for someone else there.  I remember the first time I went, I was immediately drawn in by the trendy, hip atmosphere. It was a place to be seen at and the place to see all of the hot, model-like waitresses and hostesses. 
This formula is repeated now in two additional locations in the GTA (downtown Toronto, and Markville Mall).  

The following is about the Yorkdale location.  Located in the most upscale mall this side of Canada, Joeys Yorkdale was the sight of a non-fatal shooting back in May of 2013.  Has it discouraged diners from eating here? Not at all.

On any given evening weekday or weekends, there is always a queue as frantic shoppers look for a decent place to dine other than the food court or the other restaurants inside the mall. (Not surprisingly, Moxies and Milestones, like Joeys originated from the West coast of Canada...)

The highlights of what I've had at Joeys over the years are:

1. The butter chicken, with a side of garlic naan flat bread, basmati rice, and green peas.  The butter sauce is not authentic of course, as it's a bit watered down with sour cream as to minimize that spicy kick, invoking a fusion feel to it while retaining some of the flavors that makes a butter chicken.  It's my default dish whenenever I am at Joeys.  

2. Another is the tuna ahi sandwich.  Now this is quickly replacing my butter chicken as the default choice.  It's basically a hamburger without the beef patty, replaced by a piece of fried ahi tuna patty, topped with a crispy onion ring between sweet pepper relish.  The flavors are marvellous for tuna lovers everywhere when it comes to this sandwich and quite worthy of the commanding price of $17 for a sandwich. However, I have a problem with the size of this sandwich, but more on that later.

3. Joeys also offers a steak and sushi combination, which I found rather disappointing. I've only had it once out of curiosity.  The issue with this dish is the rice used in the maki Rainbow roll is not vinegar rice. It is plain white rice that tasted very dry, reminiscent of Uncle Ben's. It just does not have the same texture and flavor one finds in vinegar rice that is at most if not all sushi restaurants.  The steak is fine on its own, albeit small as its a 6oz striploin. I would not recommend it to sushi lovers.

4. Finally, another highlight for myself would be the Baja fish tacos. Comes in 3 tacos, with basa catfish, guacamole, lime, shrimp pieces.  Hardly worthy as a filling meal, should be more of a appetizer despite it being located on the menu under sandwiches.  The balance of all three main ingredients comes through in this fish tacos, very refreshing on a summer's day, enjoyed very well with a mojito.  I specifically like the crispy corn tortillas that they use in this dish.  But, I do wish the portions were bigger. You can order an additional taco or two above the aforementioned 3 pieces at $3.50 each however. 

I've never had a problem with service here, the waitresses are nice and accommodating, as long as your requests aren't too over the top.  Your assigned waitress can be hard to flag down during busy times, however, there are an abundance of them so even if you flag down the one that wasn't assigned to you, she will find your waitress for service.

I want to give Joeys 4 star review but the \"upscale\" price for middle-class, mass produced quality, small portions of food in their entrees prevents me from doing so.  It is as though the inflated pricing is paying for their rent, the ambience and the trendy locations that Joeys restaurants are located at.  For patrons who want the best of ambience and aesthetics with decent food, Joeys offers what they're looking for. 

I'm a fan of Joeys, despite their shortcomings in portion control.  It just means I won't frequent their restaurants as often as they would want me to.

In closing, Joeys Yorkdale repeats the same formula that Earls/Moxies/Milestones has done before.  What separates them from the others ultimately comes down to location, convenience, choice of food offerings, and for some - how much money is left in their wallet after a shopping spree, because Joeys Restaurants in the GTA are all attached to a nearby shopping center!

(The washrooms at this location is located the opposite end of the place, up a long flight of stairs on the 2nd floor.  Very, very inconvenient if you sit at the lower floor bar area.  Whoever thought this was a good interior design? Questionable credentials.)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Joey. The decor is beautiful and modern and the dining room is large and spacious. I had the ahi tuna salad and grilled cheese lobster sandwich with mushroom soup and enjoyed all dishes immensely. Our server was really nice and the gringo beer and Caesar I had were awesome. Totally recommend!!! (also great to people watch at)

(PS: this resto has an elevator to the 2nd floor so it's accessible for anyone with walking difficulties or who may be in a wheelchair!!)"}
{"text":"Great space. Great atmosphere. Servers are attentive but the food is just ok. You dont come here for the culinary experience. Menu could be a bit inventive. Overall, this is better than Moxies or Milestones."}
{"text":"I love the Steak & Sushi (perfect meal combo in my opinion ). I have ordered this dish at other locations but this one prepared it best (the steak was in a soy-based sauce instead of being served on its own). Nice staff and atmosphere."}
{"text":"The 500 salad with chicken was sooo good. Quinoa, barley, mint, parsley , radish, almond,  other veggies.
Great service."}
{"text":"I think Joey is one of my favourite chain restaurants, mainly due to the consistency in both their food and their service. I've been to three of their restaurants in the Vancouver area, and now this location at Yorkdale Mall. 

I work not too far from here, and there are not very many \"good\" restaurants in the area. I had a meeting with some out-of-town business associates this past Friday and they wanted to take a few of us for lunch as a \"Thank you\". Joey was the first place that popped in my head, as I know they really have something for everyone. 

I am guilty of ordering the same thing almost every time I go to Joey, (Tuna Sashimi Salad) so this time I decided to try something new. However, I caved and ordered something I've had before - the Herb Crush Salmon. It's been a while since I'd had it, though, I was just hoping it was as good as I remembered. (It was!) 

We started out with some appies for the table - the sliders and the chili chicken. Both very much enjoyed by everyone. The most popular dish with our group was the Steak + Sushi, with four out of six of us choosing that! I've had it before and it's an excellent choice. The other main was the Rotisserie Chicken, and the person who ordered it couldn't stop raving about how good it was. So tender and moist - of course I had to have a bite! Delicious! 

Their apple pie is a long time favourite of mine, served warm with Maple ice cream (wow!) but this time, we were all too full to get dessert. 

The servers are all very knowledgeable about the food and drinks, and they make a point of explaining each dish as it's ordered. Bonus points for remembering all those details! 

My only complaint about this location is that the music is incredibly loud. We asked to have it turned down, which they did - but just a fraction. For lunchtime, this is really annoying and very difficult to hold a conversation at the table, as there was a  speaker right above us. I do hope they change this. It might be fine for later in the evening, but not great for business lunches. Everything else is top notch!"}
{"text":"Joeys was fantastic! I had their steak frites which was well portioned and tasted great too! I ordered a medium rare and that's exactly the way it was cooked! I think they could use more vinagrette on the arugala salad though because mine was very dry and very bitter.

I also love that they played an on going video of their chefs learning how to cook different dishes in different countries. That was very unique and it show cases their chef's talents. 

Service was great and I love the look of this place. However, I feel very bad for their servers having to go up and down the stairs to get the food around and all. Those girls must be fit!"}
{"text":"5 star for amazing service! 

We had about 3 different servers ask us the moment we sat if we needed anything to drink to get started. Granted it was a shift change (according to the lady),  but way better than being ignored during the change. During the actual meal, another person dropped by to ask about our experience. He went through tables and asked everyone. I guess they're in charge of the actual experience, than serving. I thought that was cool. Throughout, Linda checked in with us to make sure we were OK. She was on top of it! 

Food wise, I enjoyed by butter chicken. I feel like it was more of a soup because it didn't have much meat, but still good portion. I've had better butter chicken. Ive also never had butter chicken with veggies in it. It's usually just chicken for me so this one kinda threw me off... But, still great tasting overall. 

This is probably my second or third time being here and overall, very impressed with quality of service and delicious food."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday night, it was quite busy but we got a table for 4 within 15 minutes. 

We were there mainly for drinks but I was pretty hungry and thought to try something on the menu. I had ordered a lobster grilled cheese sandwich with fries. The sauce that came with it tasted really odd to me, almost like a cocktail-ketchup. The sandwich itself was VERY greasy and I could only finish half of the sandwich. 

Although I did enjoy the ambience and drinks, perhaps next time I will try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Overrated and overpriced.

The 500 salad was tasty though.

I can't believe how gross the house wine on special was (red and white!!)."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a group of 6 on a Saturday night. They had happy hour still in effect on Saturdays until 6pm, so we all ordered two rounds of drinks-- I had the sangria, which was made with red wine and came garnished with an orange slice. Decent sangria for only $4! 

For mains, I ordered the Yellowfin Tuna salad (which is my favourite at Joeys!!). The slaw is dressed with a delicious zesty dressing, and there was decent proportion of the tuna. 

One of the fries and steaks we ordered arrived cold, so we informed our server. She took the dishes back to the kitchen and the manager, Matteo, came over to the table to apologize. He was very nice and offered us additional sides of fries and sweet potato fries on the house while the kitchen redid the steak entree. Furthermore, because one member of the group had to eat her entree after everyone else had finished eating, Matteo told us that the steak entree would be removed from the bill because of the inconvenience. 

We received great service from the staff tonight, and I am impressed! Nice ambiance as well, dim lit with cool lighting accents, perfect for couples or a group!"}
{"text":"It's my first time to try Joeys, i think it has Great food and beer selections!! Super busy and kinda loud.  Very nice ambience.. Love it!"}
{"text":"I went there this evening for the first time. I really expected more since all my friends said it was amazing. The restaurant is beautiful and looks so fancy. To drink i had the peach bellini and it was delicious, my husband had the Muskoka something beer, it was horrible, and extremely bitter so we told the waitress and she was kind enough to exchange his beer for something he liked. We ordered yam fries to start and they were good, just really salty. For our mains I had the Steak and sushi which was really good, except I found the steak to be really tiny, and cooked medium, i asked for medium rare... it was tasty, especially the sushi, but again i found everything waaaayyyy too salty, i couldn't even bare the soy sauce on the sushi... I'm feeling extremely bloated because of all the sodium I ingested at that place. My husband had the hand pressed burger, and he was very disappointed, the meat was very dry and flavourless, and as a burger lover he still thinks Moxies burger is the best out of these chain reataurants. However, the best thing of the night was the lava molten cake!!! It was so delicious!!! Ooey gooey and just perfect for anyone and everyone who loves chocolate. I definitely would come back just for the dessert. Overall, JOEY is a pretty decent place to eat. Not cheap but not too pricey...and the service was good... We waited a while for our food to get to us, but it was good to have some time to chit chat."}
{"text":"First time at Joey
With for my sister's bday last Saturday.
1st time I experienced H-anger.

Waited over 25minutes on my virgin caesar while my sister and her friends had they appetizer come
Out.

I Ask the waitress 3times and 2different person what happen to my drink?
I lost my appetite. I Order cab sirloin $26 it looks like a fillet mignon look like someone cut it in half 7oz is small for this dish.
My bf got a New York streak for $30
The streak looks much bigger n double the size of my streak.

Fancy but not worth the money.

Sorry wont be going there again even if"}
{"text":"Great food options for any taste. This location is my favourite amongst all. Servers are always more professional and nicer compared to Don Mills location. My favourite dishes are : Tandoori chicken flatbread, lettuce wraps with crispy noodles, Peppercorn steak with their signature mashed potato. The interior is so nice and if you face the windows you can see the sunset in the evening."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the lobster grilled cheese. Good cheese blend and chunks of lobster. We also tried the ahi tuna salad and that was amazing as well"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal at this location or any Joey. Food is very consistent and I haven't tried anything I didn't like. 

I'm not a huge fish person but surprisingly the only thing I now order is the ahi tuna club. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Love! Love! Love!

I had an amazing experience here at Joey's Yorkdale.

We were welcomed upon arrival and they scurry to find us seats as the place was super busy.

Our server was awesome. She quickly took our order and kept update with us during the whole dining experience.

Our food came out quickly. I got the lettuce wraps, the sushi and steak and as well, the pasta. They were all perfectly prepared to my liking. I may or may not have ordered with my stomach and my eyes, took most of it to go. The boyfriend ordered the tuna salad (it's his favourite), he didn't go all out as I may have did. He knew."}
{"text":"Have been to Joeys many times as it is my favourite restaurant. Food, drinks, and service never fails to disappoint! I have never had a complaint at any location but Yorkdale is by far my favourite. Love the atmosphere as well and it's great that it's right next to the malls entrance."}
{"text":"From our inital visit to inquire about services, to well after the conclusion of our anniversary lunch, the service at Joey Yorkdale was exceptional.  Nathalie worked with us on every detail from specific drink requests such as holding bottles to offering child-friendly menu options.  Even when our guest list fluctuated, staff were at the ready and everyone was friendly, approachable and utterly professional.  

Our guest list o ~35 friends and family couldn't say anything negative about the experience (service, ambiance and food).  Staff were so courteous that the general manager pulled us aside to mention that the waitresses had a \"moral dilemma\" in which they felt that they were being over-tipped (we as the hosts were covering the gratuity, desserts and drinks for our guests, while they covered their entrees, thus creating a possibility where they received additional tips).  Their concern was a pleasant surprise as this type of attitude is typically non-existent elsewhere. 

My partner and I couldn't be happier with how the event unfolded.  We, along with many of our guests, would be happy to return as repeat diners.

You have excellent staff at this location.  They deserve recognition for their outstanding work ethic as they showcase exactly what quality customer service is all about.

Thanks for making our anniversary memorable!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place as you can tell from my 5 star rating. There are not many places that fill up my water in a timely manner compared to the fast pace I tend to drink mine. I tend to drink a good 5 glasses of water with my dinners, not sure why it just ends up that way. But our server, oh shoot I forgot her name, either Julie or Marie for sure, kept up very nicely. She was very sweet and knew the menu very well. Also, the food came out at a great pace. I ordered the Ahi Tuna club  with Yam fries and my boyfriend ordered the Mushroom and Cheddar Burger with skinny fries. My oh My. My ahi tuna club was just to die for, I certainly enjoyed that lemon tartar sauce that comes with it. Decent portions, as someone who comes from an Italian background and knows the full extent to how much filling a plate really is I can say that it's good enough. I always love a little extra to go however. Our dessert was the Apple Pie with Maple Ice cream. It took a tad bit longer than the dinner did to come out, which actually was better. It gave my stomach a chance to settle and get ready for an amazing fresh apple pie. I had a great time and am looking forward to getting a cheese plate with some wine next time around."}
{"text":"Huge thank you to Thaddeus my server! He was a delight! Always love going here, food is always great, though this time when I got my chicken fettuccine alfredo it was a very small portion (I've ordered before) and it wasn't as good as it normally was. But the Korean cauliflower was BOMB and the key lime pie was FANTASTIC."}
{"text":"My first experience here was perfect. The server and the manager made sure everything was perfect from start to finish. My meal was customized according to my shellfish & dairy allergies. Each dish was brought out and presented by the manager himself.  I've returned several times after and the service is very consistent and will definitely return and recommend to all my family and friends."}
{"text":"I consider the Yorkdale area a culinary slum. Apart from the mall, there really isn't anything worth eating within a 15-minute radius of the place. With the mall being filled with many major chain restaurants serving up pretty uninspired food, Joey comes along and stands as a lone beacon of hope.

It's hard to classify the type of cuisine they serve. There is definitely a strong Japanese influence with a lot of dishes integrating sashimi cleverly. There's also a bit of Mexican and Indian, along with your standard Canadian/North American fare.

But as bizarre as the menu is, everything works together quite nicely. The dishes are creative and fun, but most importantly, they taste good.

We had the lettuce wraps (better than PF Chang's), ahi tuna tacos (on point), rotisserie chicken (executed well), a steak (cooked perfectly), and the butter chicken (surprisingly pretty good as long as you keep an open mind and aren't an 'authentic cuisine snob').

Our server was great. Very courteous and professional. They missed/forgot the lettuce wraps originally, and when I informed them of that, they apologized and offered it to us on the house.

Did I also mention that they have a vegetarian and gluten-free menu?

Great experience and definitely my go-to spot around Yorkdale."}
{"text":"I returned to Joey Yorkdale in November 2013 and was pleasantly surprised at the improvement over my last visit.  Our server was very friendly, attentive and nice.  Food was excellent - we had cheeseburgers and split the spicy beans as an app.  Amazing how much difference a good server can make to a visit!"}
{"text":"If you love sushi, you HAVE to try the sushi cones. I come out of my way for it when I'm having cravings. A little pricey at $4.75 but so good! I also love crispy mashed potatoes. Haven't found anything like it. The prawns on our ravioli didn't taste fresh, hence the 4 stars. Other then that? Great service and vibes! Been coming back for years and will keep doing so until I try the entire menu!"}
{"text":"Insanely busy but food is great staf is great highly recommended for a shopping mall restaurant lol"}
{"text":"Super busy on a Thursday night but service was very friendly and efficient. 

Ravioli with shrimp $21 - very nice and light cream sauce. A good portion of shrimps and they were also quite large in size. 

Beach salad $17.50 - very good combination of ingredients that went well with each other (Grilled chicken, goat cheese, walnuts, avacado, strawberries and  variety of leafy greens)

Very pricy in my opinion but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Sushi cone was amazing but the last bite, to my surprise was a ball of wasabi. Thia could be killer for someone who can't handle it. 
There should be a warning on the menu

Icetea was watery. 
Never offered for a refill.

I ordered the prawn and lobster ravioli and it was amazing. So good. So creamy.
The portion was just so bad.
For $22, the portion should be double what it is.

Lava cake is a must"}
{"text":"This might be a bias review. The lobster grilled cheese was my favourite burger of all times. However after looking at the menu I was uber disappointed to find out that they have discontinued it. I continued to order the ahi tuna burger which was still good but not lobster grilled cheese good. Also ordered the lava cake which was same as other joeys.

The service and ambiance was really good thought just disappointed that they no longer have my favourite thing on the menu"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting service especially how Wesley 800$ here last week ! The managers are rude ! And not accommodating whatsoever ! In such  an economy they should not be treating ppl who spend money like this ! Especially st this location! Seriously disgusted !"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to go here for a while now. I was not disappointed. The atmosphere is outstanding, I love the wooden tables and the nice view. The service was really good, our servers were very friendly and efficient. I enjoyed the food as well. I got the sushi and steak and i thought for a non sushi restaurant, the sushi was pretty good. I also liked the steak also. Overall very good experience and will come back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Super happy with my impromptu visit here when everything was closed on Easter Sunday. Ended up sitting at the bar and greeted but Nikki the bartender, she basically made the night (on top of the great food). The restaurant is gorgeous with modern loft like decoration and a huge screen to watch the NBA playoff games. Nice wine list,
I selected a $19 local Niagara Pinot (9 ounce glass) that was light & delicious. I had zero clue what I felt like eating and there is a LOT of varieties of food to choose from. I ended up choosing the rotisserie since it is one of their specialties and Nikki recommended and I was not disappointed! The chicken was a generous portion of succulent roasted chicken with a divine gravy on the side. Nikki told me I should sub out the fries for the \"crispy mash\"... best advice ever! The crispy mash was basically a loaded mastitis filled egg full of goodness... def recommend. I finished off with the apple pie and vanilla ice cream that was to die for, no wonder it's been on the menu since the place opened... I liked this place so much I kinda want to figure out a way to return before my vacation is over in a day and a half! Great service, ambience and food. Two words: Do it!"}
{"text":"I will give credit here for the awesome decor, good customer service and amazing ahi tuna club sandwich...the fish taco was kind of weak and not worth the $14.75, fish was too battered and not enough guacamole....to be honest this place is quite pricy but worth it for the atmosphere if you and your friends are going on a night out, they've got a lot of neat cocktails"}
{"text":"I've only been once but the salads and sangria were awesome, great presentation and atmosphere. I'll for sure be going back. :)"}
{"text":"The hub and I went to check out the new area in Yorkdale a few weeks before Christmas and we just had to eat at Joey (I must go to all of them). As I have mentioned before, Joey is what chain restaurants should be like (and so many of them are just not!!). It was a Friday night, so we were worried knowing from experience the crazy line-ups Joeys normally has. However when I finally managed to get to the front of the hostess counter I was told it would only be a half an hour wait (for Joey that's nothing). They so conveniently take down your number, and will call you once your table is ready. So off we went to the Microsoft Store!
It was around the half hour when I decided to call just to make sure I hadn't given them the wrong number. My name appeared to have disappeared from the list, even though I saw the girl writing it down! How is this possible I said!!! Anyway, it appears they have 2 hostess areas: one upstairs and one downstairs, and whomever picked up the phone was upstairs!!! They were immediately apologetic and said to come in right away and they would seat us (and they did).
This Joey is very large with dining areas on both floors. The staff as usual is very friendly and good-looking. The menu is essentially the same as in the other locations with a few variations; there is something for everyone. We had to order water twice before it finally came. For dinner we had the Sicilian Prawn with Linguini, and the Florentine Ravioli with scallops and prosciutto. The linguini, as the hub said, was not good, too many things going on at once made for terrible \"flavour confusion\". My ravioli were delicious. For dessert we ordered a Happy Ending (decadent chocolate cake, with sea salt, and dulce de leche), this is the best dessert they have, and it's just the perfect size.
When the bill came the waitress asked how everything had been and the hub responded with a \"MeH\". To which she asked for some details. He gave some constructive criticism about the linguini. She called the manager, the manager asked if he wanted something else, but we had just finished dinner!! So the hub said that he had already eaten it because he does not like to waste food. She did not offer anything else. I guess these are some of their growing pains. Still I look forward to the next time we meet!"}
{"text":"Joey has a great thing going. Very similar to Moxy's mantra of elevated cuisine and instead of dim interior, Joey elects for loft like ambience. 

Anna is nailing it behind the bar with professional and approachable service to ensure all of her patrons are well taken care of. Really enjoyed the BBQ Salmon Bowl with brown rice - perfect portion and nutrients for lunch!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my girl and it was just so disappointing. By the time we got seated it wasn't so busy anymore but our server had her attention elsewhere. Took about 15 minutes for her to come back to take our order, because she was chatting up a table where her friends were seated. We had both ordered steaks but when I had a taste of mine it was like I was downing a bottle of seasoning and the steak was also super chewy. Our water was never refilled and it took 10 minutes for our waitress to ask us how our meal was. We spoke to the manager who took care of the issue with the steak. The salad that came with the steak originally had no dressing but the one that the manager brought had dressing.. Inconsistent dishes! 
When we got our bill the server gave us a 5 and 20 dollar bill with a couple of quarters and she seemed confused when we asked for it to be broken up. She still ended up giving the wrong change and took the quarters, not that we cared about the quarters but she had no clue what she was doing. Would've given this place one star but the hosts were nice, the second steak was much better and the lettuce wrap appetizer was pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is always busy no matter what day of the week it is. There food is good and there service is too. The only problem I've had was receiving my appetizer food cold which sucked. Other than that this place is defiantly worth a try!"}
{"text":"Their appetizers are sooo good that I usually just end up getting that. I've had a few of their mains and there pretty good as well. But the rainbow rolls and gyoza here are sooo good, I haven't been able to find anything that comes close to it at any other spot I've went to. I end up ordering multiple rounds of those 2 apps. Environment is dope, really good couples place to eat. Prices are a little high. But as I've mentioned the appetizers will keep bringing me back. The flatbread is pretty good too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Everyone's dish looked and tasted phenomenal. I had a shaved steak au jus sandwich which was cooked absolutely perfect. The mashed potatoes were amazing looking. They were mixed with sour cream bacon and chives, but what made them even better was they were wrapped in an egg roll coating and deep fried"}
{"text":"I can see why everyone would love this place, but to me it's nothing special. I am a vegetarian and I am happy they have a vegetarian menu which makes it easier for my self to narrow down my options. I had the lettuce wraps with soy protein, and Korean cauliflower to start. Both tasty, but not a fan of the under cooked noodles in the lettuce wraps. As an entree I had the veggie burger with fries. The patty was good, bun was to thick but overall enjoyable. I should have replaced the fries with something else, they were cold and thin; reminded me of McDonalds fries. The reason for the 3 stars is not entirely because of the food, but also the service which is mediocre. Takes a while to get drinks, and not an attentive server. 

It was not a bad experience, I will probably visit again next time I am at Yorkdale, I heard their salads are good."}
{"text":"I love Joey's in general, a frequent customer at the Markville and Eaton center location. Came here once (first and last time) and the service was terrible. By terrible I mean they never refilled our water, asked for ketchup and it never came, our waitress disappeared too. Asked a difference waitress for it and she told me to ask our own waitress. When we asked for the bill, well, it came in less than 1 minute... And the restaurant was probably 70% empty.
On a side note, they changed their menu and took away my favourite dish - the tuna club :("}
{"text":"The staff was phenomenal!

However, our waitress took 20 mins to bring our second round of drinks and also forgot to give my friend the special on her summer sangria on the bill.

Regardless, my friend ordered the rainbow roll and loved it and I tried the beach salad and i fell in love.

Overall, it's a little pricey but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure eating here! I was extremely impressed with the management this evening. I specifically asked for no bacon in my dish and unfortunately when it came to the table there was bacon. The waiter apologized and then offered me a salad as I waited for my meal to be re made. This was handled very well. 

My table started with the calamari and baja fish tacos. Both were very delicious however overly fried. Too deep fried I felt like I took a bath in oil after eating them. 

My main meal the Ahi-Tuna sandwich was divine!!! Perfect flavour and texture. 

For dessert we shared the maple apple pie and ice cream, it was burnt and not the best/ perhaps it was just a bit over done. I've had it before and it was great. 

I really enjoy how you can get a taster of an alcoholic beverage before ordering the full size to make sure you like it. The frozé is a staple!"}
{"text":"I've been travelling for some time so I didn't know about joeys when I got back to Toronto. I was a little hesitant at first because we walked in after the colour run 5k. We were filthy.. And colourful... And the place looked classy. But. The staff didn't even flinch. They were all smiles and really friendly. It did take a little time to get our order at first, but once we explained that we were trying to catch a movie, things moved quick. Food came out practically instantly and bills came promptly, to the point where we had extra time to kill. 

They also let us clean up in the bathroom and plug in our iPhones. Not to mention the staff had a great sense of humour. 

Now, the big part. I said it in my tip and I'll say it again. GET THE TUNA! the salad is great and the sandwich is godly. I would defriend 90% of my Facebook friends for lifetime tuna dishes at joeys. And I love my friends. That's how much I love this tuna. Don't expect some flakey could be from a can tuna. Oh hell no. This is mouth watering seared tuna steak baby. The tuna is so good, I befriended a server from downtown in hopes to find myself to more tuna. 

Get the tuna. .... ....... Servers are all easy on the eyes as well."}
{"text":"I thought the food was really good here.

I had a burger and fries and it was legit like a superior version of a Mc Donalds Quarter Pounder and fries.

The servers are very friendly and sociable.

If i had one complaint, its really loud."}
{"text":"Wheelchaired mom-in-law in the front door and up the elevator for lunch with her nephew from London UK. Madison our server and her team made the visit memorable. This was the beginning of November and I wanted to try the Fish Tacos but that day the Crispy Chicken spoke to me and I loved it  I must have cause it's three weeks later and I remembered it. Or was it Madison or maybe the rest of the staff WOW! Even m-I-law was comfortable and important to her she was able to hear(loud but not too loud). No complaints and that is something. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed with my most recent visit. We waited for long time, but no one came to help us order. We ordered some dishes we used to order, they didn't taste as good as before. Also during our lunch, a fly was flying around us."}
{"text":"You go to one Joey's (or Moxies, or Milestones, or Earl's, or the Landings) and you've gone to them all.  (Sorry to y'all who frequent chain restaurants). 
Nothing incredibly special about Joey Yorkdale. Service was fantastic on a busy Sunday afternoon. Our server, Rachel, was very friendly despite the hectic, buzzy atmosphere. 
The grilled chicken sandwich was delicious - bacon, a spicy mayo and cheddar cheese did the trick. We were served less than 10 minutes after placing our orders. Impressive."}
{"text":"Very convenient if you're already at Yorkdale Mall and want to avoid the food court.

Last time we came here, it was during their peak lunch hours. Upon entering, we actually waited a good 8-10 minutes for the hostess to finish her phone call before she greeted us and found a table. We also had 3 different waitresses during that one seating. We were both not impressed especially since it was our first time at this location. 

Our second time at this Joey's location. We got better service this time around - but we also came in at 3pm on a Sunday. Food is always delicious!! I'm a huge fan of their tuna!! Ahi Tuna Club and the Sashimi Tuna Salad are always a great try.

... Sadly they burnt the bun for the spicy-bar-b-q chicken sandwich. But still great!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on a sunny but cold Saturday at 1pm in February with a couple of friends. Tough time to get parking so I walked through the mall only to find that you do need to be outside to get into the restaurant. No access from the mall. No biggie...just good to know for a first timer. 

Staff was friendly and we were seated promptly. One of the friends dining with me had been to Joey's several times and I consider her to be an excellent judge of good quality food. She swears by the Baja fish tacos and decided to go for this ($14.50) while she also recommended the mushroom cheddar burger ($18) that my other friend enjoyed. 

I decided to go for the 500 salad with dressing on the side. Organic quinoa, barley, raw veggies, watermelon radish, almonds, mint, parsley, avocado for $14. You could also add chicken for $3. They claim it is 500 calories (hence the name!) I enjoyed it very much and even packed up some to take home as it was quite filling. The presentation was quite pretty with the watermelon radish. 

Note: Bathrooms are upstairs but you could also take an elevator. 

It seems there are mixed reviews of this restaurant but my experience was a pleasant one. Food and service were great. I would come back. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Joeys leaves a lot of Tables for walk ins.  Don't worry about making a reservation. They are at a prime location in Yorkdale mall, so it's always busy.  Good selection with focus to a variety of cuisines."}
{"text":"I was excited to visit Joey at Yorkdale as I had heard they had a gluten free menu, which they do - it is quite small, but still nice to see when many restaurants still don't have one. 
I ordered the beach salad - I believe the only different was mine didn't have the candied pecans. It had cabbage, strawberries, goat cheese, chicken, some quinoa on top and probably a few things I'm forgetting. It was dressed is a pretty tasty lemon poppy seed dressing (a flavor I generally dislike but thought I'd try out this time - delish!)
I really liked the green cabbage in the salad. It really added to the taste of texture. Probably something I will now do at home! 

The server was decent. We were seated in the lounge but didn't have to wait long for (the only) booth (left) to be cleaned. I don't understand these places that basically strong arm you into sitting in the lounge. I always prefer the dining room. 
The server wasn't overly attentive and I think only stopped by the table 4x when we were there. To take the order, drop off the food, ask how it was once and bring the bill. I don't like being constantly asked how my food is while I'm eating, so I was okay with this. 

Overall it was a good experience, but very expensive for what it was. I don't think I would make the active choice to return, but wouldn't mind stopping in if I was in yorkdale. $17 is quite a bit for a salad that doesn't leave you feeling quite full."}
{"text":"Joeys is a franchise from the west coast serving up American, comfort food. I like their menu and the service is quite consistent but I have one beef with Joeys...the location of their restrooms. Why do they build all their washrooms on the second floor???? It's really a inconvenience for the elderly, pregnant or someone who with a small bladder.  

I am a frequent visitor of Joeys and have always liked their menu. They make changes to the menu occasionally but not for the better. First they took away my favourite sandwich, the kitsilano chicken and now the beach salad.  So I ended up ordering the farmer market chicken salad which is mixed greens with beets and kale.  Healthy and refreshing but not quite as tasty as beach salad.  My friend ordered the ahi tuna sandwich and she thought it was delicious."}
{"text":"I've always tended to shy away from burgers at chains that aren't burger-specific...what a dumb move! I guess I'd just been burned so many times in the past with dry meat pucks that I'd all but given up...well, the Hand-pressed burger at JOEY definitely has given me hope! I think the hand-pressed-ness is the key...maybe it's the greasier option when it comes to burgers, but I'll be damned if the grease isn't the key to the wonderful taste. 
Great location, decor is super nice, and the service was good. 
I see down below someone mentioned that they discontinued the Lobster grilled cheese...that's a bummer, but I will not fret since now I have a new fave menu item! 
My colleague got the veggie burger, and while it kinda fell apart once the sticks were removed (they must have been load-bearing support beams) - he thoroughly enjoyed it. I might give it a shot next time...but who am I kidding? Hand-pressed burger all the way for me! 4 EVA!"}
{"text":"I love JOEY Yorkdale!  The staff is by far the best part, super attentive and overly friendly (don't find that in Toronto too often)..The menu has all different types of food and everything I have tried over my past visits has been awesome. A little pricey but you get what you pay for here."}
{"text":"Sunday morning visit and it was pretty great.  Got the full attention if the serving staff and the upstairs ambience is pretty neat.  Food was great and consistent (my second time there) - a great place to hang with friends and chat - although I'm not sure how busy it may get during rush hours given it's right next to Yorkdale Mall.  

Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"When i first went to Joey's i was very happy with everything from the food, service to the atmosphere and it hasn't changed :)

I really like the fact that there it has multi-faceted seating, so whether your a small group that just wants to lounge in a booth, or a couple friends looking to sit at a bar and drink all night, or a having a family function with a large number, the place accommodates everyone very smoothly. Mind you there was that one time when four 10 year old kids tied up the elevator for a good 15 minutes lol

Aside from everything though if the food isn't good it doesn't matter how much emphasis they put on service or ambiance, but in Joey's case the food gets 4-5 stars. I especially loved the fried potato..which at first was looking at it thinking to myself, \"i didn't order a canoli\" lol..and was greatly surprised :)

If your in the Yorkdale area, or not...try Joey's out, you'll have a good time whether your going on a date or having a night out with friends."}
{"text":"Finally, Joey's close to home!
It's new, it's super trendy, it's fun and exciting...the food is great and it is sure to become super popular in the upcoming weeks, so hurry up before it gets crazy packed.
Decor is nice and modern, without overkill. There are two floors which means lots of seating.
Food is awesome, love their sushi cones, artichoke dip and BBQ ribs, flat breads are A-OK, but my friends all seem to like them a lot.

I struggle somewhat with their drink menu, since I'm not a cocktail person I find their wine list very limiting and their beer list is too ordinary for the theme of the whole resto. Whoever is the sommelier for Joey's, our tastes do not match for a second

Overall, it is a nice place to relax after work or long hours of shopping at Yorkdale."}
{"text":"FOOD:

CON: Same as my review with Joey Eaton Centre. The food and drinks are not good, tastes ordinary to me. I expected more from it honestly coz it looks like a fancy restaurant with good food. They just make the food look good through it's presentation.

PRICE: 

CON: It's expensive and you don't get the value from what you paid for.

AMBIANCE:

PRO: Restaurant inside and out looks amazing, fancy indeed. It is also big, with two floors and big washrooms separate men and women."}
{"text":"I know I am a bit late BUT there are no Joey's in the 'burbs. My aunt and I have been meaning to check it out so we decided to make our way to yorkdale to see what to hoopla is all about. I read reviews and looked at pictures and the general consensus seemed to be good food, small portions and sometimes lacking in service. So I was mentally prepared for all of the above. Everyone was ranting and raving about the ahi tuna options so I know I would order something with Ahi Tuna. I'm a lover of sushi so I don't mind raw/rare fish.

When I walked in, it was exactly as I expected. The décor was beautiful, you could tell that they paid a lot of attention to detail from the fixture hanging from the ceiling to the bathrooms it was tastefully done. I kept reading about HOT waitresses and they did not disappoint, although young they were all slim, fresh face, beauties. So the overall atmosphere definitely lived up to the hype.

We ordered ahi tuna tacos, shrimp pesto flatbread, chicken souvlaki 
(side fries and gravy), lobster grilled cheese (side fries and gravy) and peach Bellini's. Everything tasted good but some things obviously tasted better than others.
  
ahi tuna tacos: I had extremely high expectations for this because of all of the buzz surrounding the ahi tuna. It was good but it didn't knock my socks off. You get a solid, fresh, chunk of ahi tuna on top of a ginger dressed slaw inside of a hard taco with a side sauce. The flavours paired perfectly but I would prefer that the tuna be cut up finely and place into the taco so that you enjoy the tuna and slaw with every bite and it needs a kick, perhaps siracha.

Shrimp Pesto flatbread: This was the highlight of our night. When my aunt ordered it I thought \"how good could a flatbread really be?\" well this flatbread was the bomb dot com! I didn't even want to share her own appetizer with her. It is a garlic flatbread topped with shrimp, pesto, sundried tomatoes (which actually tasted like roasted peppers), mozzarella and chipotle aioli which gives it a nice kick. Next time I am ordering both of their flatbreads because I experience a foodgasm.

Chicken souvlaki: exceeded my expectations. It was rammed packed with fresh ingredients, perfectly seasoned meat and enveloped in a warm fluffy pita. I would definitely have this again.

Lobster grilled cheese: delicious but too rich for me. A chunk of lobster and brie grilled in a sandwich is divine but I would prefer it as an appetizer to share instead of a meal. It was very smart to pair it with cocktail sauce because you definitely need the acidity with the richness of the sandwich but it was really good.

Fries and gravy: The fries are skinny fries which I don't mind but they were far too salty for my taste buds. The gravy is the actual gravy they use in their meals. You will see chunks of onions, tomatoes and seasoning. It's not the thick, faked package stuff (I don't mind that either). I liked it. 

Peach Bellini's: Get it! That's all I have to say. You can't go wrong with a peach Bellini and this one was easily one of the best I've had.  

Fortunate for us we arrived before the after work rush so there was no wait for a table. I definitely believe that played a factor in our speedy service. Our drinks came immediately, appetizers out in ten minutes and entrée ten minutes after. We were so hungry we were literally out of there within the hour. When we left we saw a huge crowd in the front of the restaurant waiting for a table. The servers said they have an online reso/waitlist system that cuts your wait time, so I would definitely recommend that during peak hours. 

Overall, the food is excellent, depending on what you order the portions can be small, the prices are a bit higher and the service was efficient but nothing memorable. I would definitely come back as a treat but I wouldn't regularly dine here because you can find food just as good for a better bang for your buck. This is the perspective of a money conscious student."}
{"text":"Apps are the best here :) beef sliders and wings also the pesto shrimp flat bread is amazing but the best thing at joeys is the chocolate soufflé you must try this weather you like chocolate or not you will like this."}
{"text":"Horrible experience with my vegetarian dish. I would not recommend you go here if you have dietary restrictions. Absolutely disappointed with the service I had. I asked for the pan-roasted mushroom pasta without the bacon. The first bite I had I tasted bacon. I thought okay maybe that is just how the pasta dish tastes and it's not bacon, because I haven't had bacon since I turned vegetarian 16 years ago. I then found a big bacon piece which my boyfriend then tasted to confirm if it was bacon, and a second piece. When we told the waitress she then started looking through my pasta with the fork in front of me to verify! I was expecting the dish to be taken away immediately and an apology right away. I've been to other restaurants, for example Moxies, where if they make a mistake on my vegetarian meal they had a manager come and apologize and ask if I was okay, and made sure the dish was taken away. Even at the Joey location at the Eaton Centre they took the vegetarian restriction very seriously. The experience here was emotionally upsetting and I was extremely disappointed with the customer service."}
{"text":"One of the nicest/largest Locations of Joey,
Being at Yorkdale mall, it's typically more trendy/higher end..
Service is top notch at this location? Again, to match everything else..
The food I find it more flavourful, which is strange considering that it's a chain of franchised restaurants.

Weekends are extremely busy, it's very important to call for reservations ahead of time, otherwise, be prepared to wait an average of 45mins-1 hour. However, as a nice touch, you're most likely to be offered with a glass of wine or champaign on the house while you wait.
If you're in Yorkdale and finding it hard to choose where to eat, choose Joey, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, no matter what location (Don mills being the original favorite location).. The Food Is Always Good! Drinks are good too, I was here yesterday and I will keep going back as long as they keep up with the good food, drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"This place was extremely good, I love how the host all had the same dress on for uniform and the wait staff. I had the shrimp flat bread ( the very best ever) and my man had the veggie burger which he really enjoyed!!! The white wine and maple ice cream was the best in the world!!!!! Would defiantly eat here always when I visit Toronto..."}
{"text":"Very rarely do I give 5-star reviews for chain restaurants, but my experience at JOEY Yorkdale last night was exceptional. Firstly, we were able to get a table for 8 at 5 PM without a reservation (this was just good ol' luck.) Then, our server, I believe her name was Danielle, was an absolute gem! We had people coming late, and she was very accommodating in taking our orders first, and came back periodically to check on the new arrivals and also those of us who were taking longer to decide what we wanted to eat. We told her we were in a bit of a rush (had to leave at 6:30) and she was so helpful and went above and beyond to make sure our dinner went as smoothly and efficiently as possible. She told us right off the bat which entrees would take longer to prepare (mostly pasta) so that there would be no surprises for us or additional waiting. One of my friends arrived at 6 PM, placed her order within 5 minutes, and then had her sandwich arrive less than 10 minutes later. Amazing! Our waitress also offered to start preparing our bills early, so as soon as we were done, she came around with multiple machines to expedite the payment process. 

This was my second time at this JOEY, and I've also been to the one at the Eaton Centre once. Every time I've been impressed with the food. This time I had the steak and sushi - both components were good; nothing meant to blow you out of the water, but very enjoyable nonetheless. The steak was perfectly cooked to medium rare and very tender. Their fries are the delicious, thin, crispy kind, and always hit the spot.

Thanks to JOEY and Danielle for making my birthday dinner run as smoothly as possible and for saving me from a ton of stress! Maybe I wouldn't expect to get this level of service all the time, but either way, I was very impressed last night and it left a very memorable impression on me."}
{"text":"Went here on Valentines Day. Tried making a reservation day of, but it was fully booked (I'll take that, I tried). This location is pretty popular given how busy Yorkdale Mall can be.

Ordered the same thing I do every time I go, the Lobster Grilled Cheese sandwich. Always on point, a must have. It usually comes with fries & cocktail sauce, but I substituted for a ceaser salad for $2 more. 

The service was great, our waitress Ashley was never too far even though they had a full house. Would definitely recommend this location, just call ahead to reserve if you're going for dinner."}
{"text":"First recommendation is to sit up stairs. The floor to ceiling windows and decor is impressive.
I ordered the 500 salad, it was tasty, but nothing special. 
Joey's does have an expansive menu however not many items really caught my eye. I do consider it to be slightly overpriced but service was good and so was the food so I can't really complain."}
{"text":"Very good place to go! Food is very tasty!! The best \"sushi tacos\" I've ever had! The hamburguer is also amazing! Really recommend it!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my boyfriend, and damn I must say this is by far the best location I've been to! We sat upstairs near the bar, and the staff were kind and really helpful. The atmosphere itself is amazing.

The food? AMAZING! We were def. satisfied with what we ordered. So instead of having a meal each, we decided to try some appetizers. We got the hot wings, tandoori chicken flatbread, and the Japanese gyoza. All three of them tasted amazing. 

Def. will be back here :)"}
{"text":"Dropped in for dinner with a friend on a Monday night at around 7:30. 
We were greeted upon arriving and escorted to a table.
My dining companion ordered a Roast Beef Dip with a soup, I ordered the same, but with fries. Each of us ordered a beer.
When our meal arrived shortly thereafter, we ordered another beer. While my friend ate her soup, I launched into the beef dip. It was good but the beef was cold...which I thought odd but then thought this might be how they serve it here. The dip (au jus) was hot, so I didn't give it a second thought.
When my dining companion bit into hers, she said her meat was cold....not sitting on the counter kind of cold, but just taken out of a fridge kinda cold.
When the server dropped by to see how the meal was, she questioned if the roast beef was supposed to be cold and was told that it should be hot. She explained the situation and was offered a replacement. The server asked about mine and although it was cold as well, I had finished off half of it and wouldn't be able to finish off another one.
Replacement meal for my friend came out shortly thereafter and was hot.
They did comp. her dinner portion and several people dropped by the table to apolgize.
She will not be going back, I might but will try something else.
We both found it to be a bit on the pricey side, but it's in Yorkdale Mall so ya gotta think it'll be a tad pricier."}
{"text":"I had gone to other restaurants under the 'Joey' brand but this was the first time I visited the Yorkdale location. Overall, it was a really good experience! 

Ambiance is nice, we were seated in the bar area which although was a bit loud, still central to everything. Our waitress was very polite and attentive. As for food, everything I tried was delicious. I would definitely return and try more things on this menu. 

Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Ive been here a couple of times now. Good food. Great vibe. Nothing really special of note with any of the tastings Ive had.
Disappointed a couple of times with the staff being a little uneducated both in menu and drink knowledge."}
{"text":"Tastey food. Liked the baja fish tacos. Their fries for some reason are so good! The salmon dish was also good. Service was pretty prompt too. Definitely would come back here again soon."}
{"text":"Yorkdale is a bit out of the way from where I live and I tend to grimace whenever I have to come here, but I was meeting up with some girlfriends and this was the perfect halfway point for all of us being spread across the GTA. 

This place has vibes that remind of Earl's, save for the more expansive dining area with two floors available. (With the most ridiculous set of stairs I've ever had the displeasure of climbing because I am hella lazy.) After having to wait 15 minutes or so to get into a booth, we were finally seated and we were greeted by a bubbly waitress who swiftly took our drink and appetizer orders - the sliders and the gyoza. Both of which were phenomenal. 

While musing over my options for my main, I kept returning back to the butter chicken. Everything in me was screaming, 'DON'T DO IT. YOU'RE GONNA BE DISAPPOINTED.' But I decided to throw caution to the wind and go for it -- and am I ever glad I did. I'm almost ashamed to admit this, but that was probably the best butter chicken I've ever had. It was creamy, with the perfect balance of heat. The naan was fresh, the rice was perfectly cooked. This dish was completely ram packed with flavour. I had had every intention of saving half for lunch the next day, but I could not stop until that plate was clean. 

I would 100% come here again just to have that butter chicken again."}
{"text":"Joey is probably my favourite restaurant chain in Canada, so I was delighted to learn that the newest location opened as part of Yorkdale Mall's expansion. Naturally, when I stopped by the mall to check out the new expansion, I had to have dinner here! 

We arrived at 6 pm (on a Friday), thinking that there wouldn't be a wait at that time. Wrong! The restaurant was already packed with people, but luckily the wait wasn't painful at all, as the mall was conveniently located a few steps away. We waited for around 25 minutes before we were seated.

If you choose to remain in the waiting area, there are constantly food and wine samples offered. On this particular day, I sampled the Ahi tuna sashimi with watermelon and chili chicken. Honestly, I can just sit there and get full from eating samples! Even as I was heading out after dinner, they were still offering me samples. 

Now onto the food!

Lobster grilled cheese ($16) is an old favourite that I've had many times. Who can resist buttery, cheesy goodness with lobster? I substituted the default fries to a market salad (+$2) with shaved vegetables, feta, whole almonds, wild rice, chickpea and fresh herb vinaigrette. This was the first time I've had this salad and it was surprisingly delicious! I loved all the textural components, especially the crunch from the almonds and chickpeas. The dressing was light, tangy and awakened my palate. One small complaint was that the greens might have been just a tinge over-dressed. 

I was so excited to see the backyard barbeque ribs ($20 for half rack, $26 for full rack) on this menu! I absolutely loved the ribs from the other Joey locations until they took it off the menu (please bring it back!) The smokey, tangy BBQ sauce was finger-licking good and the pork ribs were beautifully caramelized. Believe me, I was gnawing on the bones like a cave woman. Even my mom, who generally does not enjoy ribs, liked this version very much. I definitely regretted getting a half rack, as a full rack was only $6 more! Best of all, this version is served with crispy yam fries (awesome!) and dill coleslaw. I will be definitely coming back for this again!    

For desserts, we shared an individually baked apple pie ($8) with toasted almonds, hand-folded puff pastry, caramel sauce with maple ice cream. After all these years eating at Joey, I can't believe I've never tried this dessert! It was - in one word - divine! 

Next time I shop at Yorkdale, I'll be sure to stop by for dinner!"}
{"text":"So tried this place yet again mostly for convenience sake rather than menu and atmosphere. I was meeting up with some girls from out of town and this location was a half way point for us and in a location with which we all were familiar. 

The wait was overstated. I called in advance and they said they don't take reservations same day and they only reserve 10%of their restaurant - like how inconvenient is that?? So once we arrived we put our names on the wait list and they quoted us 1 hour but we needed up waiting 1.5 hours. 

We finally got a table upstairs which was a decent booth. Our sever was great - the best feature of the night. His name was Mateo and he was super friendly and understanding. He made us laugh and really tried to make our night enjoyable. Darah the manager was also super great! He checked on us from time to time to make sure we were enjoying our meals. These 2 employees were the highlight of our night and the reason I'm giving 2 stars. 

The downside is the food and atmosphere. The food is always garbage here. The wings came out cold and looked super lame. They were tiny and didn't even taste great. We also ordered a gin edenflower drink that had no gin it. Seriously disappointing. For our mains we ordered the beach salad, the mushroom steak with mashed potato and the chicken sandwich with onion rings. All 3 meals were seriously lacking flavour. The atmosphere is too busy for me and the other servers did not look like there were enjoying working there on the Friday night we went. We especially remember this one server who dropped off our wings - she looked like she just rolled out of bed. Not an ounce of makeup, her hair was so messy and she didn't even smile or make eye contact. That kind of turned me off from eating. This place is a huge disappointment. It was the first time my girls went to this Joey and it was my second time. This visit was just as underwhelming as much as the first.  I think we will have to just give it a rest and try another restaurant in Yorkdale if we need to meet there again."}
{"text":"I don't give 5 stars but this place is 4 plus for sure. Had the steak and sushi, and it was amazing. Sat at the bar by myself. Good responsive service from the bartenders who are also mixing drinks for 10 wait staff. Not a quiet place so if you want that don't come. 15 foot big screen for sports down stairs; more intimate upstairs. 2 bars - one up stairs one down. Outside seating in good weather and walls open to the Outside gives the place a very open atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, even when they're busy. There's a good selection of draft beers, including a few from smaller breweries you might not see at a typical bar.

The menu is varied, but not too overwhelming. I had a burger and fries, which was actually a very juicy and tasty burger, but the fries were bland, and too skinny for my liking. They weren't bad, but not as crispy as I prefer for such thinly cut fries.

Overall, I would certainly come here again if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing! They have a great selection of food from sushi to pasta and ribs. Great service. My family and I went for my birthday and they had forgotten to bring my Mums's meal/took it to the wrong table so to compensate for the mistake/wait they gave us her meal for free and 2 desserts an apple pie and a chocolate lava cake with ice cream. The food was amazing, great quality, great customer service, good atmosphere, we all enjoyed it very much."}
{"text":"Refer to my other reviews of mini-skirts and brews.  Same place, same service, same food, same drink.

The formula for putting in high ceilings, lots of booze, cool food creations all served by tightly clothed - and minimally at times - attractive people continues to work.  By the way, the high ceilings means one heck of a climb to get to the bathrooms - which are usually needed when high amounts of BEvERages are being consumed.  More consumption during their Super Happy Hour - lots of specials.

This location is a welcomed addition since the Moxies is in an underground dungeon near the cinemas.  I like Moxies but the natural lights and large windows makes this place more inviting.

If you are coming here for great service...check it at the door.  They hire on looks, not service.  Too Bad.  

With that said, and the fact I have reviewed places like this before, I am teetering on 3.5 stars for this location.  Markville is better for service.  Eaton Centre rocks overall.

Cheers."}
{"text":"My food experience here at this was not that great however the customer service we received was amazing. I ordered the chicken enchilada with the side salad. I asked for the dressing on the side. When I got the salad, dressing wasn't on the side. The chicken enchilada was covered in hot sauce (if ever ordering this, order not so much hot sauce) therefore it was too vinegary and spicy. To top it off, as I'm eating I find a long chicken bone in the enchilada itself. Not good. I was turned off and returned the dish as I couldn't eat any more. My friend ordered a Caesar and it tasted like pickle juice. Now the customer service we received after our bad food/drink experience and understanding. I have always loved joeys and will still continue to go. Just thought I'd share the info so u r aware...happy eats!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Thursday night; prompt service. Food was decent but that's standard for a chain restaurant. At least the washroom wasnt as much of a pain to get to as the one at Eaton Centre."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, but getting beer in a dirty glass by an exhausted server; really unpleasant. This is one franchise that is losing the personal touch of their beginnings."}
