{"text":"Passed by numerous times, lot is always empty, decided to stop in and quickly learned why the lot is typically empty.  The guy working, I presume the owner, could use a webinar on customer service.  I'm at the age where I simply can't tolerate poor attitudes, therefore, I will never patronize this place again.  Went to Handle's in Twinsburg last week and the ice cream and service were impeccable!  Why did I tempt fate and try a joint that is always empty?"}
{"text":"If you want a delicious and phenomenal burger for a great price this is the place for you! Their burgers are hand pressed daily and incredibly juicy! The service is great and you can end your meal with ice cream if you so choose!"}
{"text":"Great little stop either for ice cream or for a quick bite. Burger is fresh every day, better than five guys or a fast food place and much more affordable. Owner is friendly and the setting is pleasant. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The owner has the worst attitude towards customers, complained about their orders, the help, his venders.  I asked a simple question about his pita bread and  told me he was too busy to answer.  I will never darken his counter again."}
{"text":"I would not reccomand giibg there. The burgers are so bad and doesn't worth the price. The fries are tasteless and i threw up after I left the place. Do not go there."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE. The food is good, but the owner is not a nice man. My friends' daughters have worked there and that guy is bad news. Take your money to a shop that deserves it. Try Rosati's or Handles'."}
{"text":"When it comes to desserts, Danny's is everything that Dairy Queen aspires to be, only better, and charming as heck, to boot! 

Also, fyi, a \"small\" dipped cone is the size of a large at DQ. Totally awesome!"}
{"text":"Gave Danny's another try - everybody is allowed a bad day.  It could not have been a more different experience.  Quick service. The one person working was engaging and quick.  The food we got was excellent.  I am glad we gave it another shot.  We'll be going back again."}
{"text":"Danny is a bit of a character but the food is good.  We get the Big Danny's burger and fries when we do go.  Every once in awhile we grab a cone.  My mother-in-law freaking loves this place when she visits in the summer she makes us stop at Danny's.

I recommend it if you need your greasy burger fix."}
{"text":"Danny was convicted of asking a young girl who was applying for a job to give him a sexual favor.  I've lived in this neighborhood for 2o years.  Since the conviction, he is not supposed to be alone at the shop with minors.  I've not been to the shop since the incident, that involved a neighborhood girl.  I'd go to the Dairy Queen in Twinsburg or Rosati's in Northfield."}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs.  Owner is piece of garbage who yells at children AND has sexually harassed female patrons.  I would recommend eating from the trash before supporting this disgusting subhuman ' s business."}
{"text":"Not a fan at all.  Poor customer service and yucky ice cream."}
{"text":"I love the food at Danny's. The burgers are fantastic.  The fries are delicious.  I'm addicted to them.  I'm not as crazy about the ice cream, but it's not bad.
You definitely go to Danny's for the food vs. the service."}
{"text":"Couldn't have been a better experience!  Great burger, great owner. Danny visited with us while we ate. Awesome American living his dream! Great burger, great shakes!"}
{"text":"Good burgers. Good ice cream. Can't do better for a roadside lunch or snack or summer treat. Definitely worth the stop."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing vintage vibe. The burger is delicious- I recommend the Danny's burger and onion rings. I've also had excellent ice cream there. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"What a great stop along on our trip to Niagra! We had a late lunch and were so pleased with Danny and his burgers!  Loved The Danny, Swiss, and Big Swiss. Fries were fresh cut and delicious. Whether you're passing through or local - make sure pop by!"}
{"text":"The guy who owns this place is MEAN!  He shrieked at my 7 year old grandson for getting a few pieces of gravel on his precious cement pad and made a big show of sweeping it up.  When he saw the shocked look on my face he yelled \"Hey kid, go pick up a stone and scratch your grandmother's car!\" Them he asked me how I'd feel if my grandson actually did that.  He sort of apologized for his attitude but by that time the damage was done. NO ONE YELLS AT MY GRANDSON!!!  He was upset and didn't know what he did. It's not like he was wildly kicking tons of gravel around. I would NOT have let him do that!We won't ever go back there again.  And I have talked to other people who feel the same way. Rosati's here we come!"}
{"text":"I had driven by this stand on a regular basis, seeing the gyro sign tempting me.  I finally stop by and tried the gyro for lunch today.  So very good!!  What a find!! Unfortunately, he's getting ready to close for the season.  I will certainly make this a regular lunch stop next season as I hear the burgers are certainly worth a try."}
{"text":"What an awesome accidental find on the 4th of July! Vintage feel, pristine, outdoor bar seating, and an adorable mascot dog walking around. They claimed they had the best burgers and boy, was it ever! My husband & I shared the 1/4 lb with swiss, mushrooms & special sauce. We should have gotten the 1/2 lb. Hand cut french fries were finger licking good as well! We'll be back for the ice cream."}
{"text":"Interesting visit. I thought everyone else on here was being too hard on the owner, but I was wrong! The food is good and the ice cream is average. The owner, on the other hand, what a piece of work. It's really surprised people still come here. If customer service is important to you, stay away from this place. I witnessed the owner shame a customer at the window then scream at his own employees as we sat and ate our ice cream. Someone needs to send this guy a message and stop buying from his business. I'll never come back"}
{"text":"I never have eaten a Danny's ice cream and burgers until
 tonight. It was his  first night that he was opened for the season. I had a burger with onion and mushroom and French fries. It was a great meal at a great price . While I was eating my dinner at the cute counter I had a lot of great conversation with customers that were regular customers they were excited that he was open again. You know when a ice cream and burger place has customers that are excited that a place is open again it is great place."}
{"text":"I feel lucky having Danny's a quick drive from work.  Pulling up to it, Danny's is tiny, but full of character.  Barstools or picnic table (concrete and wood) are the seating arrangements.  On a sunny day, they might a well be thrones to lavish yourself in sunshine, or sit in the shade of the many large trees around the place.  Overall I find myself in a comforting relaxed state at Danny's.

\"Nice, but how's the food sun boy?\"  Surprisingly good.  Cheap burger, but the meat is not a preformed paddy.  Just a  pound ice cream scoop of ground beef.  Many different variety of toppings also, rarely getting above 5 bucks.  Danny's also has  1/2 pound kielbasa and foot long hot dogs.  Get that kielbasa in a polish boy if you wish.  Danny's also boast flavor burst ice cream.  Ice cream with streams of flavor syrup through it.

To sum up Danny's is a nice place for a relaxing lunch break or a special trip for the family dinner.  Side note: You are not supposed to feed Danny's dog."}
{"text":"Danny's makes a great hamburgers! As a connoisseur, I should know! Good as anything the fancy chains are up to, and actually much better. The prices are sweet as well! Lucky to have him here, as the construction on 82 is seeming to last for years. I'm going every week until close for the summer. Promise. (PokeStop nearby? Is that still a thing?)"}
{"text":"Danny's. A one man operation serving scoops and greasy eats out of a tiny roadside shack. The shiny silver trim, aqua blue color scheme and hamburgs sizzling on the flat top grill harkens back to Happy Days era diners. 

While take-out only, this place offers a variety of al fresco dining options. Exterior barstools that overlook the open-air kitchen or a well manicured lawn boasting stone tables underneath umbrellas. 

For a quick ice cream, shake, float, burger, dog or fries, you can't go wrong with Danny's. Quick and friendly service at a modest price served in a charming atmosphere. This is what other roadside eateries strive for, but fall short. Danny's though somehow manages to get it right."}
{"text":"My family loves this place! Bring cash and a empty belly! Ice cream is great and so are the burgers and fries! Nice picnic area"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best flat grill burgers I've tasted... and I had a lot.  The fries and onion rings are also great.  There's a nice grassy area in the back that the kids can run around in and play.  Just make sure to bring cash as credit cards are a no go."}
