{"text":"It was our first visit to Amp 150 since the departure of Ellis Cooley and the entry of Jeffrey Jarrett from Palate. We really enjoyed the tasty intricacies and unexpected combinations at Palate, so we had high hopes for our meal!  Right away, the staff was very attentive and accommodating. We had a small issue with our first starter, and it was quickly rectified without us even asking. Sous-Chef Melissa Khoury delivered up a bevy of salads and small plates, each fresh and flavorful with beautiful presentation.  Some of the things we tried over the course of the evening:  Pasta Al Ceppo - Fantastic! Perfectly cooked al dente pasta, with eggplant confit, roasted red peppers, arugula, and pine nuts. The eggplant, chopped so fine and reduced to a thick consistency, had such intense flavor. It clung to every noodle, making every bite equally tasty.  He enjoyed the Seared Scallops which were cooked perfectly.  Broccolini with chili paste and sesame seeds, had just the right amount of heat and sweetness and crunchiness of the broccoli.  Panzanella Salad - Can't beat the fresh tomatoes right now!  Beet Salad - I am not a fan of beets, but was floored when I tasted, and ended up enjoying this salad. The beets were mild in flavor and just worked with the other ingredients, especially the goat cheese fondue.  There were lots of vegetarian options on the menu - I had a hard time picking. I'll have to go back to try the rest!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Amp 150 with Jeff Jarrett as chef. I must say it was the same space, which I do not love because you definately feel like you are in a hotel lobby unless you are seated way in the back. Also it was the same average service. There were four of us and we tried the four course tasting menu which was a really nice variety of food for the price. Since there were four of us we each got a different dish per course, giving us the chance to try many menu items. We started with the mushroom flatbread that was not the most flavorful. We had four different salads which looked lovely but the dressings needed more seasoning. We had the golden squash soup which was lovely but also could have used a bit more seasoning, loved the homemade marshmallow on top! We had the lamb, the beef sirloin, the walu and the roasted chicken as our entree course.  The chicken was the clear winner, it was tender and delicious. Out of all our desserts the chocolate pana cotta was melt in your mouth chocolate deliciousness and the brownies were not far behind. Overall good value for all the dishes you get to try. With that many they can't all be winners."}
{"text":"In the spirit of tl;dr (too long; didn't read), I am going to give this place a te; de (too expensive; didn't eat).  Before anybody goes off on me, hear me out.  My wife and I were staying in a different hotel nearby.  We read the many positive reviews and ventured forth to give it a try.  When we arrived, the front lot of the hotel was full.  The side and rear lots were gated.  It was going to cost $8.00 to park.  It's a pity.  The menu and reviews looked good, but an $8.00 surcharge just to show up?  Sorry.  Not gonna happen."}
{"text":"The Double Bacon Cheeseburger at AMP 150 is a great looking burger. Ohio Cheddar, Benton's Bacon, truffle aioli, house pickles, and an onion bun. The rich flavors of the bacon, cheddar, pickles, and aioli make for a great burger. This burger had some smart flavors, however its shortcoming was the fact that the two beef patties were overly cooked and dry. This led to a very dry profile for the entire burger. I found myself chasing each bite with my drink. If you get a juicy one this burger might be quite a bit better!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to AMP 150. The first time was for an event in the spring and I only had appetizers which were quite impressive. The one that comes to mind was the artichoke shooter. I knew right then I had to go back.  Friday night I finally had the chance to go have a meal.   Shrimp and grits was outstanding. Sauce was very tasty.  Pumpkin panzanella sounded a little odd to my friend, but I was in an autumn kind of mood. It was perfect melding of flavors. A great creation.   I know others have not liked the location since it is in a hotel, but I thought it created a real sense of energy around the place. I must say my friend and I enjoyed chatting it up with some out-of-towners on a Friday night.   Oh, and I've heard about out-of-towners creatively getting there by taking a shuttle to the airport and then taking the Marriott shuttle to the restaurant. Hint, hint.   Overall, great quality ingredients, great flavors and a great value.   Needs improvement:  The CURRENT menu should be posted on their website. It says to refer to the \"social media\" site, but I couldn't find it there either. Just update your site. Please."}
{"text":"Very good place- a real hidden gem (let's hear it for good hotel lobby food).  3.5 would be my truest number."}
{"text":"Who would have ever thought there'd be a great restaurant right in a Marriott? I certainly wouldn't, but I was wrong.  AMP 150 serves grass-fed beef, free-range chicken, and a wide variety of locally grown produce for all its dishes. The menu changes periodically, but everything on it looks amazing. I can't recommend the mushroom soup enough, it was amazing!  The big drawback is that since it is attached right to the lobby of the Marriott, it can be a little noise when a group comes through, but other than that, it's well worth it."}
{"text":"An update, just had my weekly lunch here. Ordered a brand new item, Soft Mozzerella. It has a big hunk of fresh Mozzerella that's soft in the middle so it's spreadable. They drizzle the mozzerella with saba(basalmic vinegar before it's vinegar basically) and basil oil. On the side are slices of heirloom tomato, and a tower of grilled bread.  It's basically a build your own Caprese crustini, and done wonderfully. Plenty large for a lunch, and a great option for a vegetarian(which I am not)."}
{"text":"It was a love hate relationship...The ambiance was a hotel lobby, the wine list was excellent, the bus girl was fantastic and more attentive than our waitress, short rib flatbread was tiny and the meat was dry, sheppards pie was outstanding and so was the complimentary pana cotta. I would return, but maybe next time I will sit at the bar and not get the flatbread. The chef seems passionate about cooking because the menu had a lot of great items I would still like to try."}
{"text":"I am giving my review an extra star solely for the service I received from Stephanie, the hostess and the busser on 12/3/2013.  Not only were they attentive but they were very sweet and extremely hospitable.   I only had the apple salad and the hand cut fries so I can't say how excellent the cooking skills are but both dishes were tasty and hit the spot."}
{"text":"Almost always great!  Yesterday, the evening staff was less than attentive until we got their attention.  Food is always good if not great!  We eat dinner early and while the dining room doesn't open until 5:00, we can usually get dinner service in the lounge. Drinks are always great in the afternoon when Scott is tending bar."}
{"text":"Terrific small plates menu that offers an interesting variety. Very comfortable dining at the bar on weekends when the business travelers are at home. Have been to Amp150 numerous times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  But if you are looking for a quiet dinning experience this is not the place.  It is in lobby of a large hotel. I am still giving it five stars because of the tremendous reasonably priced food"}
{"text":"We have been there twice already.  The food was good.  The pork belly and the sea salt hand cut fries are my favorites.  Both of the times I think we ordered too much food.  The Entrees was okay / average.  (Braised Lamb, Short Rib, Hangar Steak, DB Burger) However, the service was very good the first time and the second time was so so.  I have been to many different Marriott Hotel's restaurants while I am out of state for work, and this one is not bad at all.  I hope their service can catch up with their food."}
{"text":"First Experience here - Underwhelmed. I have been wanting to try the this restaurant for at least a year or so. So when I finally had a chance to go I wanted to try different items off the menu since many of the items on the menu looked interesting and tasty like the chicken liver mousse, braised rabbit, quail, etc.   My husband and I asked about the chef's 4 and 6 course meals, and the waitress, said that you had to be open to all types of food. I thought great! We'll be surprised with some interesting things. So we decided to have the 4 course meal and decided we could always order more, if we weren't full.    I will have to say that the food was OK, but not outstanding and I was rather underwhelmed with the choices. That being said this is what we had.  The Mushroom Bisque soup with truffle oil.  This was a very good palette cleanser  1st course - An arugula salad, with prosciutto and an herb dressing. - Pretty standard fare, nothing special.  2nd - Apple smoked chicken drumstick over some navy beans with apple foam drizzled over the chicken and beans. - It was moist, but flavor wise nothing spectacular.   3rd course - Pork loin slices over a risotto - The pork tasted fine but was a little tough and the risotto was ok flavor wise.  4th course - Dessert - Milk chocolate Panna Cotta - was a tasty for an Ice Cream.  Overall it was an OK meal, but I didn't finish my meal wanting to try anything else.  I think one of things that impacted my rating as well, was the service. Our waitress really wasn't overly helpful. I told her this was our first time here and all she could tell us that it was a farm to table restaurant.  It be nice to see someone a little more enthusiastic about the menu and explain some items.  We ordered cocktails at the beginning of our meal and they took a really long time. When I say long, I mean the man at a table next to us, sat down after we did, had his soup and was well into his entree, by the time we received our cocktails.  Also, we wanted to have a different wine with each course so we ask her a couple of questions, about what we should pair it with. She was semi helpful, but didn't want to ruin the \"Surprise\" of the course so gave us, a, yes that would go ok. After ordering our 2nd glass, we recommended maybe a wine pairings to go with the courses like some other restaurants have.  and she was like, oh yeah, we have that...  Really? Thanks for letting us know...  Not sure if I'll be coming back. I would like to say I would like to try some of the less standard fares like the Bison Strip Tatar or their black mussels, but I'm not sure if it's worth going back for the less than stellar service and not being overly impressed the food the first round."}
{"text":"Great bar and food. Vegetarian friendly. Squash blossoms, chili asparagus, mushroom risotto. Great beer selection. Who knew Cleveland rocked the food scene?"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Went in for dinner on a Sunday night with the girlfriend and had a pretty excellent time. Waitress was well informed and accomodating to dietary restrictions. Started with the black mussels which were out of this world good; the broth for them could be served as a soup and we kept going back to it. Also had the seared sea scallops which came with an arugula salad with a citrus vinaigrette, shaved fennel and blood orange supremes. The scallops were cooked and seasoned nicely. After that we had a spinach salad with a nicely fried egg on top, but the flavors for the salad paired strangely; vanilla vinaigrette with smokey bacon... just seemed like a strange combination, although more interesting than bad. We then had the fried brussel sprouts with speck and red onion, the sauteed brocollini with chili paste, and the pork osso buco (One of my favorite things in the world) with roasted root vegetables. The brussels were the highlight with a sweet sauce and the crispy salty speck. The broccolini was good, but just seemed so out of place... perhaps it was my fault for ordering classic brussel sprouts with classic osso buco with a vietnamese or thai preparation on broccolini. Still good, just didn't merry well with everything else. The osso buco was by far the disappointment of the evening; it was tough and dry and underseasoned, the poor execution trifecta. The root vegetables were nicely season but undercooked even for me, and I intentionally undercook my veg a little.  Overall we enjoyed the atmosphere and the menu was really interesting, and seems to change often. We were digging the decor though I could see how it could be perceived as cheesy, and the service was excellent throughout the meal. A few execution errors will not deter us from returning because the highlights of the meal were so high. We look forward to returning."}
{"text":"We went to Amp 150 for my birthday yesterday and was excited to try the restaurant since i've heard so many good things about it.   While the location of the restaurant itself was odd (it was in a hotel lobby), it didn't bother me too much. Susan, our server, was terrific and very helpful. The crispy calamari salad was amazing. The calamari was fresh and sweet, the salad, very fresh.   My friend had the sea bass as well as the risotto and I had the smoked in pork chop. Both the sea bass and pork chop were divine. However, the risotto was very bland. i really wanted to like the risotto because everything else tasted wonderful but it was just too...blah. we couldn't finish it.  dessert was this chocolate mousse covered in caramel  with banana ice cream and toasted coconut laid on top of a honey au jus. I was afraid that the mousse  and caramel would be too sweet but it was just right. it was a good way to end a good meal. They also have a decent wine  and beer list.      So why 3 stars? well, to be honest, the risotto was to blame. a dish that tasted like that could very well have ruined the meal.   I'd go back again but I'll make sure to stay away from the risotto."}
{"text":"It has been a few years since I visited AMP 150.  Drinks were strong, which is good.  Service was pretty good too.  Ordered the humus appetizer and salad.  They were both good, although I'm not sure I'd make the drive specifically to go back. If I'm in the area, I'll stop again."}
{"text":"Pork Chop as under cooked, very pink inside. Had to send it back. When they brought it back to me, it appeared to have been placed in a microwave to finish cooking but it was still pink in the middle. The server told me it's ok now days to have pork pink. Needless  to say, I could not eat the under cooked pork so I ordered a dessert. Servers were nice and attentive."}
{"text":"It's a lobby, people.   Having been in the Marriott for a seminar I decided to have lunch and do a bit of work. No Wi-fi signal available made me check my calendar to see if we were in the 1990's.   Was presented with a cloying menu. I can tolerate a bit of this for a dinner menu, however a lunch menu that waxes poetic is tedious.   When I looked up as my server appeared to present me with my order I thought at first the plate must be a salad, or a butter dish....it was so small. Yes, \"small plate\" taken to the edge of just plain tiny.   If the menu had listed multi ingredients there might have been one of each....the fingerling potatoes were just small slices looking as pathetic as three limp pickle slices on a fast food hamburger.   It lacked nothing in flavor and if I were a toddler it would have been a fine lunch. Adding a $4.00 coffee to the bill noting it was \"Starbucks\" to justify on the tab....only added to my wish to seek a satisfying lunch minus the theatrics somewhere else."}
{"text":"We have been to AMP 150 many times for dinner and they always make us happy that we stopped by. The food has always been great with Ellis and Melissa and I expect it to be the same with Jeff there as well. Stephanie gives us impeccable service and we always ask for her section when we eat there. The last time we went the risotto w/ peas was one of the best tasting that I have ever had. We also tried stuffed squash blossoms and they were very delicious. If you haven't been to AMP 150 you owe it to yourself to go for dinner."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place. By far, the best hotel restaurant that I've experienced. This is my second time staying at the hotel and eating at the restaurant. The food is outstanding. I started with a beet salad and then had the braised lamb. They also have good local draft beer."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch, and it was good.  I have been here for brunch, and the buffett was pedestrian at best.    Lunch was full of flavor.  Corned beef and swiss on rye is always a great combo.  The breakfast buffett was full of the normal drab.  Runny eggs, flavorless bacon, dried breakfast potatoes.  The only redeeming quality is that the menu options look promising.  If you want breakfast, stay away from the buffett."}
{"text":"What's that smell?  I ended up at AMP 150, in the lobby of the Airport Marriott not by chance, but by necessity. Most of the hotels were full downtown and I elected to stay here.  I was headed out to some Irish pub that I found on Yelp when the staff at this buzzing, open-air bar/restaurant showed me tonight's menu.  Even the chef came over and gave personal recommendations....what the heck...I'll eat here tonight....no driving, no waiting.  The beer selection is decent.   I went with a a German Pils called Six Point...5.2 and smooth.  Good start.  Then I smelled it.   Good god, whats that smell?  A mixture of sewer gas and stale beer.  It passed and I hoped it was from the large table behind me.  I ordered the seafood bouillabaisse...recommended by the chef.  Very tomatoey...very nice.  I devoured this yummy dish and ordered my third beer.  Then the smell again.  Damn.  It's bad now.  Why does it smell so bad?  Houston, we have a problem.  I was just trying to get through this meal and head back up to my room.  The beer was cold, the meal was good...the smell in this area...next to the bar....unbearable."}
{"text":"Love it. Stick with small plates. Suggest chicken soup and mussels. Seasonal changes are always good. Pork Belly- WOW. The salads are always great too."}
{"text":"I was really undecided on my rating for this place, but went with a 4 instead of a 3. There really isn't much that this place does wrong and I think the faults that I have found are out of Amp 150's control and more in the hotel's realm.   The atmosphere was really weird here. We were seated on the edge of the restaurant area and were getting a lot of weird lighting from both the lobby and dining space. It was bright, almost fluorescent and we felt as if we were on stage and a spotlight was cast on us. It was definitely the furthest thing from mood lighting you can get. This also meant you could see your dining neighbors in all of their glory...or un-glory...as well. One woman kept making the most outrageous faces at her date...I didn't really expect conditions to be quite ideal since it is located in a hotel lobby, but I guess I didn't expect what I found either. The decor and desired atmosphere obviously points to something other than what they're achieving. On the same token, the music choice was very uncharacteristic of a restaurant such as this. Classic rock was not what I expected to hear here and it really took away from the already struggling atmosphere.   As far as the food goes, everything was fantastic! I had the beet salad, which was one of the best I've ever had. The beets were tender and plentiful; the goat cheese was warm and perfect. I also had the grilled jumbo shrimp. Jumbo is not an overstatement at all! These shrimp were huge! The accompanying flavors were great, though the shrimp felt a little over seasoned. This did not stop me from eating as much of my dish as possible, though, because it really was fantastic. My fiance had a salad as well, though I don't remember what it was, and the braised beef short rib minus the ravioli. He had dietary concerns and our waitress and chef were very accommodating, so that no unwelcome carbs were on our table.   For dessert, we were talked into the goat cheese cornbread, which, though unusual seemed like it wasn't executed to its fullest potential. The flavors were all very rich and worked well together, but something just didn't seem right.   Really, this place is a light-dimmer-switch (or better division from the hotel lobby) and a new Pandora station away from 5 stars."}
{"text":"Got into town a bit late and was looking for a bite to eat.  Checked Yelp from the Marriot and was delighted to find a nearby option... only 0.02 miles away?  Was surprised to find a decent restaurant in this hotel.  It was a little on the expensive side, but for the convenience it was totally worth it. $25 bought us a huge appetizer of house-made chips, and two appetizers of tacos (beef brisket and shredded pork).  Both were tasty, but a bit dry.  However, the accompanying sour cream and green salsa were a perfect compliment. May need to visit here again if nothing else but for the convenience."}
{"text":"Had multiple visits to this place App was the edamame - cant complain, tasty enough Main dish was the scallops, delish, but lacked additional substance Desert was key lime pie - disappointing must try harder, i expected more"}
{"text":"rating based on its location and surrounding restaurants in the area, which were far less appetizing. this is definitely a gem in the area. definitely a must try if you want some great food in ohio! this is what we ordered: pate mushroom soup beet salad scallops striped bass sauteed squash"}
{"text":"I had this amazing Sea Bass entree with Roasted Chic Peas and something else. The beer is good too ;) and therefore I cannot remember it precisely. But I can tell you it was absolutely delicious and different.  Also the Caesar Salad, with the anchovies! (Come on now, keep it real) is a must.  You'll probably never have had one like it before. Finally, Shari was one of the nicest servers ever and a great conversationalist that truly loves her work and environment."}
{"text":"douglas trattner wrote that amp 150 was among \"the 25 restaurants cleveland can't live without\" this week in the cleveland scene. hearing other buzz, we decided to try amp 150 because it's right down the street from our house. this was a mistake. this place is not good. i left feeling confused and hungry. the best description of our entire experience would be \"bizarre.\" first, yes, this is a LOBBY. the management would do well by creating some screens, separators, or curtains to segment the bar and dining room off from the lobby, otherwise you are staring at all the hotel folks coming in and out. it's not pretty. the two-tops are ridiculously small, cannot comfortably suit diners, and are bizarrely laid out. there is absolutely no ambiance. the service was also very strange beginning with a magic trick. our server/bartender was an odd one, overly enthusiastic, yet somehow condescending. we were actually asked for a credit card to begin our \"tab!\" there was barely anyone there, we were clearly there to eat dinner, and did they really think we were going to walk out? this doesn't happen at the taphouse or the beer engine, i don't know why it should happen at the airport marriott! ok, so the food. bizaarrrro. we started with the killbuck mushroom, celery leaves and goat cheese flat bread and risotto. flatbread was probably the best option for our entire meal, but nothing really special. the celery leaves seemed an odd touch as they added really nothing to the overall taste profile. the risotto was not risotto. it was rice in beef broth with some spinach (or was it arugula) and onions. the risotto was undercooked and overly brothy and did not have any hint of creaminess as you expect in a risotto. finally we had the baby scallops and shrimp bok choy and the wedge burger. the scallops and shrimp were unremarkable and seemed a little chewier than i expected. the burger was just odd. it came open-faced on a piece of toasted white bread with a wedge salad on top, covered in crispy onions and ranch dressing. i don't know anyone, with the exception of those on the atkins diet, who wish to eat their burger with a fork and knife, so i recommend offering at least another piece of bread on the side to assist in the overall burger-eating experience. the burger itself was overcooked and nothing spectacular. after our plates were cleared, we sat for another ten minutes without being approached for coffee, tea, or dessert. we asked for our check and the server asked, \"aren't you going to have any dessert?\" well, if you'd asked me ten minutes ago, maybe i would have. at that point, we really just wanted to get the hell out of there. the only saving grace was the extensive beer list, but for better service, beer, food, and ambiance, you can hit up the beer engine, taphouse, or greenhouse for much better bang for your buck. i suppose if you're a business travel stuck at the airport, this will do, and at least will give you a HINT that cleveland knows SOMETHING about food/beer. but much better options are just a short cab ride away."}
{"text":"Took my wife there for her birthday and was pleasantly surprised. The food was amazing and the service was very good. I would highly recommend the Delmonico Steak.  Great place for a specialist out."}
{"text":"We went to Amp 150 with a couple who had been there for the chef's tasting menu before. They raved about it so we got the six courses for $50/person. This turned out to be way overpriced. The mushroom bisque was just okay, my husband enjoyed the mussels (2 bowls since I hate mussels), the salad was also just okay, the flounder was good and the chicken with sweet potato risotto was tasty. The other couple even said it wasn't as good as their first time there. We won't be back but I'm glad we had the experience."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in the Cleveland area. If you haven't been there yet then you're missing out on some truly amazing food. Every dish is prepared with great thought and care. Every flavor is thoughtfully considered and every menu item is scrutinized. Don't get too attached to anything on the menu, though, because it changes constantly for seasonality.   The \"small bites\" dishes are really nice for sharing (we usually order two a piece), but the \"big bites\" are fantastic full entrees that provide more than enough for one to eat.  I had some friends go there and complain that the dishes were too small. The \"small bites\" are meant to be small portions that you share in order to experience a variety of food. The prices do reflect the portion sizes. If you want more, order another one. It's as simple as that. Also, note that this is not a place for meat and potatoes people. Eat at AMP 150 and be adventurous! Try new things like rabbit meat and quail eggs. If you want a plain grilled steak then this just isn't the place for you.  My single piece of advice for anyone considering going to AMP 150 is just to mentally get over the location. The restaurant is perfectly nice and refined with a contemporary, upbeat vibe, but it is in an area that's a bit run down. It's also in a Marriott that doesn't look too great on the outside (and parking can be a bit scarce) but that's quite nice inside. I've never thought that the adjoining lobby is a big deal at all. I don't know why Yelpers are so stuck on that. In my opinion, the TVs in dining areas at other restaurants are much more annoying.   I've always had great service at AMP 150 and the food consistently amazes me. Please try it if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"This place is golden. One of the things I dread when traveling for business is getting out of the hotel to find a place to eat. The fact that this really good restaurant is in the lobby is a super plus. Ate the Pasta al Ceppo, the fried Brussels Sprouts, the risotto, the crab cake and the date cake. Everything was super good. Way better than some free standing restaurants I've eaten before. Service is pretty good too and staff is pretty friendly."}
{"text":"I'll second the review about the tasting menu--it's a staggering amount of food, and it's wonderful. Each person gets six DIFFERENT courses, so we got to try 18, but I'm definitely going next with a party of four so I can try 24 of them!  By Cleveland standards it's pricey (and the excellent mojitos were not cheap) but totally worthwhile.  I got to try lots of different things.  I will say, though, as a person who is not crazy about meat or most shellfish, I had fewer options, but my omnivorous tablemates were very pleased, and I filled up with the salad and dessert courses.  my tablemates loved the mussels, scallops, lamb, pork and beans, and rabbit.  My favorites were the shrimp and sweet corn risotto, mushroom pappardelle pasta, peach turnovers, and gaspacho.  the waitress was very friendly and helpful, and we had a great chat with the sous chef.  I'd recommend getting a table near the back, though - - otherwise it's way too clear you're eating in a hotel lobby!"}
{"text":"First off- the location is odd.  That being said, our group had a grand ol' time at Amp 150.  Overall, the ingredients were impeccable- all local and fresh.  Preparation of those ingredients could have been slightly more refined (my steak lacked a crust, shrimp slightly overcooked in shrimp in grits, etc.), but the great flavors were there!   My ball n' chain and I hung out at the bar before the rest of our party arrived- our main bartender (Tom Petty) made some great mixed drinks and actually provided a lot of entertainment since he knew a bunch of magic tricks (he literally has a bag of tricks).  The other bartender, ACDC was also a bunch of fun and was able to give some stellar beer selections and provide some good conversation.  The beer list is extensive and had some new choices.  Not quite as extensive as Bar Symon etc., but still large.  Im not much of a wine drinker so can't comment on that.    Plan to go back and try some more dishes, the menu is interesting since it lends itself to sharing Tapas sized portions but also has traditional entree sized portions if interested.  As mentioned earlier, it sticks with local fresh ingredients and one can't go wrong with that.  The prices are very reasonable, our group of 5 had a LOT of drinks and food and I think the bill came back at $160.00."}
{"text":"Does AMP 150 have an identity crisis? Is it a.) a hotel restaurant, b.) a beer lover's paradise c.) a foodie destination.....The correct answer is d.) all of the above.   3 couples descended upon AMP 150 on Saturday night to see if there really was a quality restaurant in the Airport Marriott. There were many skeptics among us.  Atmosphere:  Keep in mind that you are entering a hotel and with that, you are always going to see all types of people. There was a class reunion going on in the banquet area of the hotel and there must have been a hockey tournament in town as well due to the oversized bags and kids everywhere. We slowly approached the bar area and had to ask if this was AMP 150 or not. The nice bartender informed us that, yes, we were in the right place and that she could take our order. For those that remember Jack's at this location, burn it out of your memory, it's gone. The whole restaurant is open to the lobby, which might confuse people when they're looking for AMP 150  Bar: The bartender was nice, although she needs some education around the long beer list that's offered.  It was good to see some of the normal suspects, GLBC & Flying Dog on the menu, but it was also a pleasant surprise to see some more unique beers listed. The beer offering is outstanding and rather large. If you like beer, you'll definitely like their list and be able to find something you like. Their \"house\" drinks were also the rave of the ladies in attendance. The manager was kind enough to offer them a few samples; among them was the Bloody Mary, which was fabulous. They are making all of their own mixers and the quality of the ingredients shows.  Food: As a group we decided that we'd order up a few appetizers and split them amongst us. We tasted the Flat Bread, Oyster Mushroom appetizer, Pig Feet Tamale, & Tamarind Pork Belly. Yes, these were all appetizers offered in a \"hotel restaurant\" All appetizers were very tasty and unique. The Mixed Green Salad and Chicken soup were also ordered.  The soup came out just a little on the chilly side, but the taste overrode the temperature. The mixed green salad I was told was also well prepared and very good. For main courses, we again tried to spread out and cover the menu, Skirt Steak, Pork Chop Schnitzel, Rigatoncini, and Beef Tenderloin were all tried. Again a temperature issue arose with a few of the items, but nothing to overpower the overall taste of the item. My guess is that they are still trying to get the timing down on some of the items and some may have sat a little longer than they intended.  We weren't done yet, dessert was ordered. We ordered the Milk Chocolate Pana Cotta and the Warm Chocolate cake. The Pana Cotta was by far the big winner here.  The warm chocolate cake was good, but the creaminess of the Pana Cotta far outweighed the moistness of the cake.   Service:  Service was very good, but I'm not sure if this was because she was attentive or if it was due to the lack of patrons. Water glasses were always full and she stopped back multiple times during and between courses to make sure that the meal was moving along at the right pace. It was.    Price:  We decided that we'd split the bill amongst the 3 couples, the grand total per couple was $120, inclusive of tax + tip and alcohol. Every person at the table had at least two drinks at the table.  An excellent meal for a good value. Check it out if you get the chance.  Overall:  Would we go again? Sure, although I do have some recommendations. Save spaces out front or offer valet service for restaurant patrons, as I stated there was a reunion in the hotel that night and parking was at a premium, we therefore had to enter from the back parking lot and work our way through the reunion crowd. Kick the kids away from the bar, if you are trying to be a little more than a hotel restaurant, act like it."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this place, the menu intrigued me and I've heard good reviews. So my experience goes a little something like this: made reservations several weeks before Valentine's Day, arrived at our designated reservation time, was told we would have to wait 30-40 minutes for our table. Headed to the bar to get a drink while we waited, stood at the bar for 10 minutes, no acknowledgment whatsoever by bar staff. Boyfriend asks bartender if we can order drinks from him or if we have to go to the other end of the bar, bartender replies \"yeah, but you're going to have to wait a minute, as you can see we are pretty slammed\". Boyfriend and I promptly walk out disgusted with the complete and utter lack of professionalism and service and head to one of our stand by favorite restaurants.   I know, I know, going to a restaurant on Valentine's Day and expecting great food, prompt and courteous service and nice ambiance may be asking a bit much. However, it is my opinion that outstanding and friendly service can redeem mediocre food, a longer wait or lacking ambiance.  It's all a shame because the menu items really piqued my interest and I couldn't wait to try several of them. Perhaps we will go back again to give them another chance, in the meantime, hopefully the staff is taking a \"Working in the Service Industry 101\" class!"}
{"text":"Amp 150 was totally fine.  It was really weird to feel like you're having dinner in a hotel bar, but the service was great.  The food was good, just not spectacular.  Overall, fine.  Not outstanding, just fine."}
{"text":"Definition of a pork schnitzel:   A schnitzel is meat, THINNED by pounding with a meat tenderizer, coated with flour, beaten eggs and bread crumbs, and then fried.  What I got: a thick fried tuff pork chop. I mean it was obvious it was your run of the meal pork chop, coated and fried. It was disappointing   So if you're going to call it a schnitzel, make it a schnitzel.   I also had the AVACADO toast. The AVACADO was so thinly spread on the toast I couldn't even taste it. Also on the toast was a huge overpowering over easy egg, and a very chewy piece of ham. With AVACADO being the first word I would expect to have a decent amount on my toast. The ham was so chewy I couldn't finish 1 of the two pieces and sent it back.   Good news the chocolate, bacon & pretzel desert was pretty decent.   Good concept, could use better execution. Also, service was not very friendly."}
{"text":"Located in Cleveland Airport Marriott, Amp 150 was described as rated 5th restaurant in... Cleveland? No, Ohio? No, the US? No, Marriott's? Yes. Not sure that is a good thing and maybe setting the bar rather low. The service is okay, the bar is convenient, but is not very private. We only had drinks and bar food so maybe my review would be more encouraging, if I had ate in the dining area. I had the pulled pork tacos. $10, expecting 3 mini tacos, but no just two, $5 each was a little much. They were over stuffed, but the pork was dry making them less tasty. Less meat and a little drippings would have made them much more flavorful. As I say with many places I've reviewed \"live, learn and move on\", there are more places to experience and only go back if they are good to great!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good hotel food with fresh ingredients, creative flavor pairings, and friendly service. I enjoyed lunch here before a work conference and ordered the rabbit parpadelle and roasted cauliflower. The rabbit was a little dry, but the sauce was delicious and the pasta also wasn't overdone. Cauliflower was okay (I would have liked a little less cheese). The truffled mushroom soup looked and smelled good but I didn't get a chance to sample. Colleagues also got large salads which looked delish and I heard the chocolate caramel dessert is fantastic. Service was fast enough for a quiet afternoon. I wouldn't mind eating it again and considering the other options in the area, this is probably a winner. Ambiance is a little upscale, with lots of nooks for more private conversations and to forget you're in the hotel lobby. They also offer a very afforadable tasting menu."}
{"text":"Not very impressed at all.  The prices are very high which matches the upscale atmosphere. The dining area is very nice.  A lot of the food is not good. I ordered the pomegranate salad ($13) and the coconut chicken curry soup ($6). The soup was a very small portion, had dark meat chicken, and an unpleasing amount of green onions. There was also very little to no seasoning in the soup. It tasted like a watered down chicken noodle soup. I had to add a pile of black pepper and salt to taste anything. It was almost a put off. My cousin ordered the soup as well and only had a few spoonfuls.  The pomegranate salad was not a very large portion of salad. It was alright, the goat cheese was good but the dressing was not in my opinion. I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone. It might be better with chicken or meat in it.  From what I've seen of the dishes that my family ordered, the portions and the tastes do not match the prices. The sirloin was $24 and it was a portion about only 3/4 the size of my fist.  Overall I would not recommend this restaurant, especially for a family outing."}
{"text":"great beer selection. Only one problem, they give you the same fluted glass regardless of beer style. I know not a big deal but why not be serious about the beer?   The food was great. Fries, beef rib and gumbo were standouts. Friendly staff right in the hotel."}
{"text":"Well, the old \"Jacks\" (or whatever it was called) is long gone and this new place is really !!! worth staying in-house for dinner.  The chef focuses on high-quality food that is locally farm-fresh.  What you get depends on what is in season and available.  We scarfed up the delicious mussels, enjoyed the two flatbreads we tried, thought the fried pork belly was pretty good, and my marinated hangar steak was outstanding.  Anybody staying at the hotel can save themselves the taxi ride elsewhere to eat, this is definitely one of the better dining options in Cleveland (and I've tried a lot of them)."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Over priced. I think they walked next door to Denny's to fill my order. Calamari was straight out of a freezer bag, the bottom to be exact, with tons of bread crumb shakings at the bottom. Scallops were 7 or 8 tiny llittle things. I can't believe I paid this much for such crap. Never again."}
{"text":"Shed the airport hotel stereotype. This restaurant is excellent. We ate here because of  the good reviews and closeness to where we were staying. The food was great and the service was excellent. Stephanie (server #35 per receipt)  was awesome. I cant think of one negative with her service. That's so refreshing. We all enjoyed our dining experience here very much.  Note: To Tim E from Columbus OH who slammed them with one star for the $8 parking. If you were smart enough to let the server know like I did. They happily gave me a token to exit without charge. You foolishly assumed and hurt unnecessarily."}
{"text":"Perhaps I ordered wrong, but I really don't see where all the high ratings come from. $10 for a bacon cheeseburger with no fries and not even lettuce and tomato? I live in Manhattan and this is expensive for NYC standards! The burger was ok, certainly nothing special. I should've gone to the cheapo diner (Canarys?) I found on yelp down the road... at least if the food is only ok, your wallet is still full. Also, my wine was priced at $7 on the menu but I was charged 7.75. Didn't feel like arguing over 75 cents but I can't say that I am impressed. This is a typical hotel restaurant in my opinion, and I stay at a lot of them!!!! Certainly adequate, but overpriced. Check in on Foursquare for 5% discount."}
{"text":"Come to the palace of magic and your enjoyment will be wonderful.  Food, drink, and entertainment is magical.  Dream a little dream about me and turn into a unicorn with potato chip and mussels. Don't stop won't stop uh huh uh huh"}
{"text":"Our experience started off slow, but it got better. My boyfriend and I sat at the bar. He asked about draft beers and the bartender didn't know. Her service overall just lacked. She was cold, unfriendly and unknowledgeable. Her shift must have been ending though, because halfway through service we received a male bartender that was 100 times better. We started with the mussels which were great and moved on to the truffle Mac and cheese and braised lamb. The truffle Mac and cheese was phenomenal, the braised lamb itself was excellent, but the side of beans were boring and bland and didn't match the dish.  I think serving the lamb with some vegetable would be better, but that's just me. The atmosphere was a little off. The restaurant is located in a hotel lobby, but my boyfriend and I warmed up to it after a couple drinks."}
{"text":"I think I've got mixed feelings about this place. I went in with some fairly high expectations and my experience just didn't live up to them. The atmosphere is your typical \"restaurant in a hotel\" with a bit of cheesy lounge thrown in. There are a couple of huge rounded banquettes with gold bead curtains and the tables are surrounded by cushy red vinyl armchairs. There's a bar toward the front of the space and the whole area spills out into the hotel lobby. I didn't think it had much of a restaurant feel.  We had reservations at 6pm on a Wednesday. We approached the hostess stand and were greeted and seated immediately. We were given a four-top toward the rear of the restaurant. Since we're normally seated at two-tops whenever we dine out it was nice to have the extra space. Our server was OK. While she was friendly and attentive she seemed distracted every time she was over at our table, constantly looking around or over her shoulder at other tables. Hello, we're over here...  The beer list is pretty extensive for a hotel restaurant and quite well organized. Presented on its own full page the brews are organized by type with plenty of info to help you with your selection. Don't come here looking for a large draught selection because you won't find it. Almost all of the beers are available in bottle only with a very short (six taps?) draught list. On the positive side, there are tons of unique craft beers and they are reasonably priced. I opted for the Laughing Dog Sneaky Pete imperial IPA. At 10% it might have been a tad heavy to start but it got me through the dinner.  Here's the grub rundown:  House Made Potato Chips - Nothing suprising here. A large portion, plenty for two people to nosh) of crispy chips served with a duo of dips (Dortmunder aioli and onion). The chips were seasoned and the dips were tasty.  Chicken Soup - Watch out if you order this one, it packs a punch. The heat hits you in the back of the throat almost immediately. The soup was filled with avocado, radish slices, jalepenos, diced peppers and tomatoes and came served with a lime slice. The broth was tasty but I thought the level of heat was a bit much.  Zucchini Latka - These were probably the biggest disappointment of the meal. More like two traditional pancakes with some zucchini in them they were pretty dry and bland. Even the schmear of sour cream that came with them didn't help. Pass on these.  Ohio-Raised Beef Sirloin - Locally sourced cow, nice. The dish had a nice-sized steak, pre-sliced, laid atop a bed of yellow beans, spinach and fresh gnocchi.  I ordered the steak medium and it arrived mid-rare. No surprise. It was well seasoned otherwise and the gnocchi were awesome little pillows of potato goodness. I'm not a huge fan of spinach but it wasn't bad. The beans were a bit crispy for my taste.  Seared Scallops - Two large bay scallops seared golden brown with cubes of pork belly topped with what I believe was kimchi (or some kind of cabbage). My wife really liked the dish but I thought the pork belly was way overcooked verging on tough and dry, the scallops were over salted and the kimchi was just not for me.  Amp 150 is definitely a step up when it comes to hotel lobby dining. The menu has a focus on local (yeah, but who doesn't anymore?) and the beer selection is strong but I just expected more, especially given all of the glowing reviews. There were quite a few business folk in suits seated around us and I left wondering if they were feeling the same way. Normally Yelpers tend to get it right. This time I think they missed the mark.  P.S. Update your online menu for cryin out loud. There were several menu items that were the main reason for our visit and none of them were available."}
{"text":"AVOID GOIG TO ANY OF THEIR HOLIDAY BRUNCH BUFFETS. I went their this year for their Easter Brunch because someone recommended it. I didn't bother to ask how much it was upon arriving, but I had eaten dinner there before and knew their dinner prices were reasonable. The buffet was not impressive. It had a carver that was carving ham and pork tenderloin. Grilled chicken in a mushroom Demi glaze was very dry, green bean casserole, carrots, mashed potatoes and gravy( the best part of the buffet). They had a basic omelette station with nothin extraordinary to select from to add to your omelette. A small breakfast buffet with scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, and potatoes. And finally a small salad station with your basic salad toppings and some orzo and deviled eggs, along with a desert table (the cake and brownies were definitely not made in house, both very dry.   Now giving the description above, and what they were offering, it's very clear that this did not have anything off the hook. Absolutely no seafood at all, and the meat they were serving was not expensive prime cuts of beef. When I received the bill I was shocked. For two people it was $90.35 before tip! It also included a $14.00 convenience fee that was not explained at all. Now, drinks(tea, water, pop, coffee) were included, but a brunch buffet for two being $100.00 is insane. The buffet made Golden Coral or Ryan's look like a five star buffet.  I will not be returning anytime soon because of this. Also,since this is pretty popular and fits nicely with people who don't like to cook, there were a lot of large groups of people and a lot of kids running around and screaming. I was constantly being asked to move my chair in so kids can pass by or get through."}
{"text":"If you order a sandwich or burger you will be very happy but if you order a 7 ounce sirloin you will be very disappointed! Although the menu says it come with mushrooms you will be lucky to find one. The charred leeks amounted to one razor thin piece of leek not leeks! The potatoes were tiny rounds of baby potatoes! Had I known better I would have ordered a side of veggies. The little bit of food I received for the price was good but left me wanting for a real portion given the price."}
{"text":"This is the typically Marriott food, but with a little upscale flare.  The menu is different in terms that is almost like a tapas like offering.  I wouldn't say that there is anything to try that would \"blow\" your mind, but for Marriott food its not bad and does the job when you are wanting something to eat.  They offer a lot of beers and full bar, which is nice."}
{"text":"AMP 150 has been a favorite of mine for awhile. We often go there when we want a nice meal but don't feel like going to one of the trendy neighborhoods in town.  They do not have many vegetarian options, but what they do have is delicious.  I\"  My favorite is the chopped salad, which is large enough to be a meal itself.  The dressing is divine (white balsamic I believe) and they put it in perfectly, not too much not too little.  I learned the value of avocado in a salad after having this salad a few years ago!  The saltiness of the kalamata olives blends in perfectly with your other salad staples - carrots, grape tomatoes, romaine lettuce.  I've also enjoyed the cauliflower goat cheese side dish in the past and the tomato soup.  At my last visit, I got the ricotta gnocci with kale and beets.  I have recently learned that I love beets, and I always try to like kale.  I didn't have to try hard this time - the bitterness that generally accompanies kale was completely gone. The ricotta gnocci was like biting into a pasta pillow.  The restaurant itself is strange because it opens up into the lobby of the Marriott.  It feels like you're dining in the middle of a hotel if you're not seated in the back. However, it's also generally much quieter than other restaurants since it's not in the busier restaurant districts."}
{"text":"This restaurant exceeded my expectation.   The server Stephanie was very personable and helpful w the menu.  The starter plates of brussel sprouts and cauliflower were so tasty along w the brisket tacos."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem, in a hotel away from all the action of Cleveland. I have had the six course tasting menu twice now and what a bargain at $50 per person. They also have a four course tasting menu for $35 per person. The menu itself is pretty reasonable for the quality of food you get. I have not had anything that I didn't like with most of the food being outstanding, 5 out 5 stars on food. Some of the highlights that I have had are the light and foamy Velvet Mushroom Bisque with truffle oil, Edamame Falafel, Braised Lamb, Fried Pork Belly with Hoisin Glaze and Pan Seared Bronzini with Sunchoke Puree. They have a very large domestic  beer selection with some great Midwest finds. The wine list is adequate but not great. Service has always been very good, with attentive  knowledgeable servers. the downside of the restaurant is its location I'm sure it would be busier if the location was different. Some of the things I don't care for is that you may have to park some distances away from the front door if the hotel is full and the atmosphere, you feel pretty much like you are eating in a lobby of a hotel. I think a upgrade on the server uniform would not hurt either."}
{"text":"Had a recent late dinner at AMP 150--the second time I've been to the restaurant.  First off, I still can't help but be impressed by the renovations to the Cleveland Airport Marriott, and it's doubly impressive to have such a quality restaurant in the lobby.  On the downside, a lot of the parking in the front was taken up by hotel guests (or perhaps other restaurant patrons, though it didn't seem that crowded), so we ended up parking in the back.  AMP 150 continues to impress with its food offerings.  The Oyster Mushroom and Goat Cheese Flat Bread was a good starter, and we followed that up with the Chicken & Apple Croquette and Rabbit and Ricotta Cavatelli.  Unfortunately, I didn't get a good read on the croquette but the cavatelli was, again, a pretty good dish and something you won't usually find in nearby restaurants.    For my main dish, I had the Smoked Bone-In Pork Chop, which has a persimmon glaze and sits on top a layer of black eyed peas and next to some collard greens.  Again, the dish was pretty good, but I think I was expecting a little bit more \"wow.\"  As for other items ordered, the Chicken Soup was very well received and the Crispy Calamari Salad looked pretty good.  A downer was the Wedge Burger, an open-faced burger topped with a lettuce wedge covered in blue cheese dressing.  The burger part of the dish was served a little cold--evidencing timing problems in getting the food out.  Service was very friendly but a little slow (although they may have simply been short-handed for the Friday after Thanksgiving).  As for the general atmosphere, you are constantly reminded that you are in a hotel restaurant because of the lobby and the hotel patrons at the bar.  On the other hand, there's no reason a hotel restaurant--and even a restaurant in a hotel lobby--cannot be a great experience (The Lobby in the Peninsula Chicago comes to mind).  The reason I hold back on more stars (or even why I wouldn't consider it a solid three star place) is that while I like the direction AMP 150 is going--a menu of surprising items wrapped inside an entirely surprising hotel--I think the tastes need a little more refinement before AMP 150 is competing amongst some of the downtown eateries where folks tend to walk in with higher expectations."}
{"text":"I've been to two Yelp Elite events at Amp that were AWESOME. I decided to come back with a friend to try their happy hour. The lighting is soft and low, space is cool and comfortable with a chill vibe, I'd say it would be a great place to relax after work or meet up with a date.   Bartenders are friendly and attentive. No issues at all with the staff.   Drinks of course are on the strong side. Food was just okay this time around. I went with the deviled eggs and I'm not sure those ever give off a \"hell yeah get in my mouth\" taste. I also went with this baked, creamy, gnocchi & cheese dish with toasted bread crumbs on top. This was pretty good! Heavy, but good. My friend went with the fried pickles which I thought were overwhelmed by the breading. Two are okay, but I didn't want to eat anymore. They also got the tacos and enjoyed them, I had a bite and thought they seemed regular.   I'd like to go back and give them another try, I might have just been a sourpuss the night I went."}
{"text":"Alright so the company had a training session in Cleveland and shipped a ton of us from all over the country. We were not allowed to rent cars and I was feeling lazy a few nights this week and decide to order from AMP 150 downstairs in the lobby. Now yes I know that hotel food is usually no bueno but I had eaten here last year and remember it being very solid.   Now let me start by saying that they have an awesome beer selection here. A ton of microbrews which is surprising for a hotel restaurant as that is not usually the case. Now over the course of the week I ordered the, Duck Confit Nuggets, Pork Belly, Pear Salad, French fries, mushroom flatbread, and the wings. Honestly I am not going to go into much depth because it's pretty straightforward. All of the food is very bland here with not much flavoring. Even the pork belly which looked awesome but ended up being very bland and found myself unable to finish the food. The bbq pork flatbread was just terrible and was not able to have even more than one bite of it which was unfortunate because I was pretty stoked about it.  The folks here are really nice and the alcohol selection is great which is what holds this joint together but I will definitely find other options to actually each food. Such a shame because I felt that food was very good last year so this decline is disappointing. Hope they can change it up to get back to where they were!"}
{"text":"I hesitated before rating this place-I think it has the potential for a 4 or 5 star restaurant, but our experience was only a 3 star.  We had a restaurants.com coupon for the place, so we certainly got a good value for our money, however, if we had paid full price, I would have been disappointed.  We decided to do the tasting menu, and it was the wrong choice.  In doing the tasting menu, your various courses are chosen for you.  As such, we got the very standard appetizers and entrees, and missed out on trying the more adventurous choices.  The food was all very good, but we felt like for the price we paid for the tasting menu, we could have just made our own choices from the menu and paid about the same price.  So to those reading this review I would DEFINITELY recommend not doing the tasting menu.  The highlight of the meal food-wise was dessert-We were treated to little mini apple tarts with butterscotch ice cream, homemade nut bars, and little mini Irish Carbomb cupcakes (they were in the process of adding those to the menu, they should be on there now: ORDER THESE! They were amazing.)  Our server was a total flake.  She would come and ask us about things, leave right in the middle of talking to us, say she'd be right back and then not come back.  She was terrible.  The chef did bring our dessert out and talked to us about what the dessert included, so we liked that.  We really liked the ambiance of the place, kind of a studio 54 glam vintage sort of feel.  My fiance and I agreed we'd try this place again, and with a different server, and making our own selections from the menu, we think this could be a great experience."}
{"text":"Yes, I know you just walked into the Airport Marriott. You'll forget that very quickly once you start your dining experience. The happy hour specials are better than the usual beers, wings and flatbreads. The assortment of menu choices will make everyone in your party happy. I've been pleased with all of my choices here. Staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. Make sure to end your meal with the panna cotta - worth every calorie!"}
{"text":"The chefs tasting menu is incredible! Must try!"}
{"text":"Went to the Easter Brunch.  Feeling used and abused.  Added a $15.00 service charge on top of a gratuity for a buffet.  For a very average buffet, with some over cooked meat.  They did have plenty of servers and were very polite."}
{"text":"4 and 3/4 stars.  This is the the kind of place I love to find. Mostly unknown, motivated chef and delicious, innovative fare.   Work (once again) landed me somewhere that I never expected to be. This time was Cleveland, OH,  My hotel that the company booked for me was pretty close to the airport so my culinary expectations for the area were pretty low. Fortunately for me, there was an outstanding restaurant in my hotel. Now, I know what you're thinking, \"Hotel restaurants suck!\" Generally, I agree. However AMP 150 is an exception to the rule.  Being that I'd never been here before, I wanted to maximize my experience so I chose to order 3 of the small plates. I went with the Squash blossoms, miso glazed cod and the brazed veal breast. I matched these plates with a nice Spanish Alberino.  The blossoms were outstanding! Stuffed with homemade ricotta and goat cheese then fried in a tempura batter. Yum!  The miso glazed cod could have been another top notch plate. However, I found it to be too salty and masked a lot of the flavors that were in the dish. A little lighter on the salt and this plate will be 5 stars.  Finally, the braised veal breast. I must admit that I have never had a veal breast before and was not ready for the amount of fat in the cut. Don't get me wrong, it was really good just not what I was expecting. To me it tasted similar to a pork belly. The cool thing was that Chef Ellis came out of the kitchen to explain the cut and preparation to me. This was especially cool because I was able to see how passionate he is about his work. Also, he sent me out another plate of veal, this time with a much leaner cut.  Clevelandites! Check this place out. You would pay 3 times for the same quality meal in LA or NY."}
{"text":"This place was located in the lobby of the hotel we stayed at. We were in town just for the Indians game and could not get into any downtown hotels, so stayed out at the airport.  My husband and I popped in in the middle of the afternoon to watch some football before we headed downtown. We were both very pleased at the large beer selection that they had and each selected a beer of our choosing. We split a burger and an order of fries for lunch and left feeling full but not overstuffed and the food was delicious!  Came back here with friends later on the same night for a nightcap. They were also impressed with the extensive beer list.  Overall, we had a wonderful experience at Amp 150."}
{"text":"So after hearing my friends talk about this restaurant and getting a coupon off of restaurants.com, i decided i HAD to try this restaurant out.   My bf and i decided to ordered their 4 course meal. The total meal came with 2 quick tasting dishes, and then the actual 4 course.   Overall (4): I love this restaurant for the decor, the atmosphere, the service, friendliness of waiter/hostee, and then their SOUP (the best part), their appetizers (mussels), and their dessert.  First Dish(5): Sweet Onion Soup and Chicken Soup Since I don't eat onions, my boyfriend got their classic sweet onion soup while they made me their chicken soup. As my bf would say, the onion soup was \"reminiscence of all the best parts of a French Onion soup while the soggy bread and with a thick creamy base.\" As for the chicken soup, the broth had such strong chicken base that you could tell they really spent time creating the broth. The soup was by far the BEST part of our entire meal.  Second Dish(4): Chicken Liver Bruschetta I'm not the most daring eater and i've never had chicken liver. At first taste, the chicken liver had a texture I didn't like, but with the apricot sauce on the bruschetta, it really made this dish stand out!! It was a dish I never would've tried that I ended up enjoying.  Third Dish(4): Rabbit Meat & Lemongrass Ginger Mussels Rabbit meat... pretty interesting to have 2 consecutive dishes where I had to try something i've never had. The rabbit meat was mixed with Spaetzle and the spaetzle gave it alitle oompf. This dish was delicious and tasted nice-- not too salty, but not too subtle. The lemongrass mussels was a big contrast to it. The sauce with the mussels were so good and to match it with chinese sausage-- YUM, perfection!  Fourth Dish(2): Beet Salad and Greens Salad The beet was really delicious. It had a hint of dill in it so i loved it. The greens salad had cabbage/lettuce with cheese on it and there wasn't much of a flavor to it. It was good, but there just wasn't anything too special about it.  Fifth Dish(3): Roasted Chicken and Pork As the main entree of the night, I wasn't really WOWed by the cooking. The roasted chicken was served with Carolina rice. The carolina rice was amazing although I thought it was a bit undercooked (my boyfriend didn't think so though). The chicken though, was way overcooked and for white meat to be overcooked, it was hard to eat. The pork thought was amazing. It was cooked like a steak and so delicious and juicy. It was served with a little salad like cole slaw and meh, the salad didn't have much flavor.  Sixth Dish(5): Funnel Cake and Cherry Pie WOW! The desserts were amazing! Such a good ending to a good night. THe funnel cake wasn't too sweet and to top of it, they paired it with a flaun that had a tint of lavender flavor. The cherry pie came with a scoop of amorado ice cream. The fruit was fresh and the pie crust was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best hotel food you're gonna get.  Had the heirloom tomato salad with buratta and it was excellent. The scallops were also very good- perfectly cooked.   The only negative I'd say is they are a little heavy handed with the pepper."}
{"text":"If you can get over the location this is a great place.  If Tremont has become the litmus of trendy places to go, this establishment would feel right at home in there.  The menu is very creative.  I have tried many of the dishes and everything is done with a level of creativity that doesn't overwhelm the dish but enhances it.  Looking back at it, this is one of the more creative restaurants in Cleveland.  Shrimp and Grits is a MUST!!!!!!!!  Flatbread can be boring and predictable but the Mushroom one is decadent.  Now to take care of that hotel thingy..."}
{"text":"Debated between a 3 and a 4, but ended up giving this place 3 stars because some of the dishes I just didn't like, even though the menu is innovative and generally tasty-sounding.  I got a variety of dishes starting with the sweet corn soup, which was REALLY good.  Really sweet, creamy with chunks of corn.  I would get this again.  I also got their chicken wings, which tasted like greasy buffalo wings I could get anywhere- nothing special about it, in fact, I only ate 1 or 2 wings.  The roasted cauliflower was a bit dry and could have used a little more roasting I think, served with pinenuts, chunks of goat cheese, and drizzled with a red radish sauce.    The main dish of tongue and cheek, which is pieces of fish, with potato hash and beef on the bottom, was really good.  The potato hash was the best part- really crispy with chunks of flavorful beef.  The fish was just OK, a bit chewy for my tastes.  The milk chocolate panna cotta was good, especially the salted caramel with the hazelnuts- perfect combination.  The panna cotta flavor was good, but I thought the texture was not as soft and creamy as I've had before, it was a bit too gelatinous and rubbery.  Overall, great selection and menu, with some good dishes and some not so good."}
{"text":"Super impressed with AMP 150.  My friend and I started with their chicken wings, which were amazing. The sauce was delicious and they were perfectly cooked.  I had their chicken veggie soup and chicken sandwich. The soup was very impressive, but the sandwich was nothing special.  My friend had their zucchini patties and burger. She said both were amazing.  The prices were very reasonable and the service was really great.  The location leaves a lot to be desired. The Marriott is not attractive, especially from the outside, and the restaurant itself has an odd formal feeling in the decor that isn't really appropriate given the menu and location.  Check it out though for sure! Especially for their small plates and appetizers."}
{"text":"It looks very unassuming but is a pretty good place! The food is good, the staff is friendly and portion sizes will satisfy the ones who like to have a full plate in front of them. The wine and liquor selection is nice, too! Also it has always been clean when I was there."}
{"text":"I don't know if it was an off night or if this is the new AMP 150 but my experience fell so short of the last time I was there that I'm taking away a star.  The service was still great and our server couldn't have been nicer or sweeter but the food just fell short.  We started with the monkey bread and the chicken pate.  The pate was still amazing and came with grilled french bread which was good but the monkey bread was a bit stale.  It had just started to get that hardened edge that comes from either sitting out of the bag or being microwaved and then sitting too long.  The butters that came with it were ok but were still cold and not easy to spread which may have taken away from the flavor.  The garlic oil was good.  The calamari salad was great and Lake Erie Creamery feta may be my new favorite cheese.  I had the pork sandwich (don't remember the full name and it's new for spring/summer)  The bread was a larger version of the monkey bread and really overwhelming.  I couldn't really taste anything else.  The roasted cauliflower was good and the goat cheese gave it a nice texture.  My dad ordered the wedge burger done medium rare.  It came out really charred and was done close to medium/well done.  The fries were crispy and hand-cut.  They tasted great.  My mom had the pasta al ceppo which had an amazing flavor but was a bit greasy. We mentioned that the monkey bread was a bit stale and that was removed from the bill without asking but didn't mention anything else.  I didn't want them to think we wanted a free meal or anything.   I'll definitely be back and we may have just ordered the wrong menu items (someone walked by with a steak and it looked awesome) but compared to the awesome experience we had last time I was just a little sad."}
{"text":"Service is all askew.   Lost in space.   15 people in the bar and restaurant and people are waiting to be talked to. Much less order. Crazy bad. System to bar tending is nonexistent.  One lady bartender is trying but when the weeds are high it's hard to see the bar.  Feel bad.  Ownership should fire the managers.  Even if the managers are the owners.  They're losing business as I sit here.  Sad. But great music on the speakers.  Hence the 2 stars."}
{"text":"We stayed at the CLE Airport Marriott and the lounge was closed se we were offered  a breakfast buffet in the restaurant which featured an omelette station and more.  We also had the opportunity to order dessert.  The food and service were solid and slightly better than expected from a hotel restaurant of this type."}
{"text":"I don't understand the lower ratings I see here?  This place is spectacular!  Great food, great service and great atmosphere!.  Waitress was awesome and the food was fantastic.  We tried a number of dishes and one was better than the rest.  Price was reasonable for the quality of food.  Tons of REAL beer selections and wine as well.  Maybe the folks in Cleveland don't appreciate fine dinning?"}
{"text":"The food here was surprisingly good..not just for a hotel resto, but overall.  I carried out for dinner so I can't say anything about the ambiance or wait-staff service, but I definitely appreciated the food that they prepared. Carry out orders are taken at the bar, so if you're staying in the hotel..it'll save you a bit of time. They even offered to call me when the order was ready..thought that was pretty nice.  I ordered: 1. Braised short rib with warm potato salad and carrots: The carrots were on the undercooked side because they were still pretty hard. I didn't mind it too much since the less cooked the veggie, the more nutrients are left in it. The warm potato salad was SOOO good with big chunks of potato. Nothing irks me more than when they say a dish comes with potato and it comes with 1 smear of mashed potato and thats it. rawr. and finally, the beef...it was done perfectly. Tender, moist and fell apart in my mouth. Yummm..  2. Flat bread with mushrooms, goat cheese, and celery leaves - This flat bread was $10 and i was like..it BETTER be good. and it WAS. It was a little on the oily side, but it was still so flavorful with the different textures wrapped up in the flatbread. LOVED the mushrooms and celery leaves together..who ever thought up this one was definitely a genius. The portion was enough for a meal on its own for 1 person.   I would definitely eat here again when I come back to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"The menu is extensive and have some great options! The food taste is OK! For this type of restaurant I was expecting a lot more. I am not saying it is bad, it is not that at all, but in comparison to other upscale restaurants that I have been to, this one is on the low end. I had the chicken soup, the papardelle pasta and the pana cotta. The soup and the pasta came in at the exact same time, which was kind of disappointing. They took it back to the kitchen but I am sure it was sitting on a heat lamp until I was done with the appetizer. The pasta tasted great, fresh ingredients, fresh pasta. The pana cotta was disappointing. Service also lacked in quality too, although it was friendly, it could have been more efficient."}
{"text":"don't understand the low reviews... i had a fantastic dinner here!  got the mushroom papperdelle, panzanella salad and they were so tasty and fresh! i love how they use seasonal, local ingredients.   for dessert, had french pressed coffee and got to try all the desserts.  the chocolate cake was amazing, as was the creme fraiche donuts and chocolate panna cotta. wasn't a fan of the lemon verbena flan.  solid, tasty place!!! definitely deserving of high marks"}
{"text":"I'm a Cleveland local and come here often just for the food and drinks, and its a cool hotel bar for a, well, Marriot. Quite unexpected. Farm to table. Local ingredients. Nice variety of menu items. Wings are great. Tonight I finished with the Date Cake. Hot, vanilla, butter rum. A great finish."}
{"text":"For a restaurant in a hotel, the food is surprising good.   We came on a week day lunch time. There was only one other table occupied. Half of the restaurant seating is closed. We ordered beef cheek tacos, mussels in plum wine, and panna cotta full size.   The mussels has a real kick to it, if you are not one for spicy food, I'd tell the kitchen up front. It's very flavorful with surprising elements. I enjoyed it.  Panna cotta was very good as well. The hazel nuts on top on the ice cream, plus the texture of the Cocoa panna cotta concluded the meal well.  Previous reviewers commented the seating or atmosphere might be kind of weird being in the middle of the lobby - it didn't bother me. I'm here for the food. As long as the food is good, the little things I can overlook."}
{"text":"I'm a total fan of AMP150! I love the farm to table philosophy and everything I've had for dinner here has always been super fresh and flavorful with beautiful presentation.  The booths are perfect for a romantic evening out, a girl's night out or there are plenty of tables for a larger crowd. I must say I'm absolutely amazed this restaurant is in the Airport Marriott!  Last evening I had the Atlantic Char for dinner and the Pana Cotta for dessert. The Atlantic Char was perfectly done on a bed of fingerling potatoes and golden beets with a red beet puree. The Pana Cotta was a milk chocolate pana cotta with house made caramel and honey vanilla ice cream - absolutely amazing!!! The caramel truly makes this dessert. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Getting stranded in Cleveland by the airline was not on my list of things to do the day I was there, but the airline found us a discounted rate at the Marriott, which is where this hotel is located. The shuttle driver was super friendly and informed us that out of the 343 Marriott restaurants, this one is ranked 4th. Um, ok, really? I was having a hard time believing him, but I was tired so I went with it. Low and behold, that guy was right. The food was wonderful, farm to table and everything else you would want your meal to be. The server was super helpful, let me sample the wine before I chose it and made deciding on what to get easy. I went with the seared scallops with risotto and butternut squash and was not disappointed. The squash is enough for two people! I ended with the date cake and it was perfect. By the end of the meal, I was almost happy that I got stuck in Cleveland so I had the opportunity to try this little gem."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Marriott on W 150th and thought we would try the new restaurant downstairs.  I was a little aprehensive given it was a hotel restaurant but was I blown away.  Our server was exceptional and explained that the chef is into buying local fresh ingredients and implementing them into the menu.  Everything is very reasonably priced so you can pick and choose a variety of things to sample.   We had the mussels...they were sooooo delicious!  The homemade kettle chips were awesome as well.  They were warm and crisp and the creamy dipping sauce was fantastic.  I also sampled the perch sandwich and broccolini.  The broccolin was fresh and delicious but a little basic.  The perch sandwich was really good.  The portion was more than enough to share.  Overall I was extremely impressed.  I hope they keep it up and that more people enjoy the dining experience rather than just hotel guests."}
{"text":"I would have easily given this AMP 150 five stars if they hadn't run out of the first two items I wanted to order. We had the chips with Aoli. The chips were awesome. I had the rabbit pot pie. It was exceptional. I could have eaten twice the amount they served. The apple pie ice cream received rave reviews from everyone in our party. The Pana Cotta was beyond tasty. The churros weren't really churros as I know them. They were more like slender donuts. The chocolate sauce also got mixed reviews. I was the only one out of our party of 5 that liked it. Thankfully, I ordered caramel sauce with the churros and we all agreed that it should be added as an option."}
{"text":"Wowza. I have been to AMP 150 a handful of times now, and it never, ever disappoints.   Located inside the Airport Marriott, AMP 150 is worth the journey, whether you stay at the hotel or not. To begin, the food is just good. G-o-o-d. Farm-to-table concepts can get lost on me sometimes, but I can taste the difference here. Its so clear AMP 150 cares deeply about their menu and the quality of their food.  The seating in the restaurant is open concept with a very modern vibe. They have small rooms to accommodate larger reservations, booths that can physically turn directions, and plentiful tables. They also have a full bar, and even infuse their own vodkas in house. The cocktail menu is so inventive and fun, and just to forewarn, you'll want one of everything.   AMP 150 might have the best panna cotta in Cleveland. The portion is HUGE and served in a deep glass. The flavor is so rich and fluffy with a sweet caramel undertone, and i'm pretty sure its what dreams are made of. Everything on the menu is excellent, and I also recommend getting several appetizers to share (the fried brussel sprouts and roasted cauliflower really stand out). Everyone can find a menu choice they'll love, and AMP 100% lives up their motto: America's Modern Palate."}
{"text":"Believe the hype, my friends. This hidden treasure on the West Side is simply outstanding. Superb food, friendly and knowledgeable service, and a wine/beer list filled with crap I've never heard of add up to one of the best dining experiences I've had...well, anywhere in the states. No kidding. I hate the word \"foodie,\" but if embracing it means I'll eat at more places like this, bring it on.  (Note to bachelor dudes like myself: If you bring a date here, she will be crazy impressed and may actually pay attention to the bullshit you usually talk about.)"}
{"text":"I had breakfast here twice - and dinner twice.  Dinner #1:  Chicken soup: consisted of Avocado, Radish, Spicy Pepper, Corn Spaetzle, Tomato, Cilantro, and Lime. The soup was rather average. It sounded better than it actually was. I ended up adding a good bit of black pepper and hot sauce to make the soup interesting.  Spinach Salad: Consisted of course of Spinach, Benton's Lardons, Shaved Fennel, Mustard Vinaigrette, and Manchebo cheese. The Spinach salad was very tasty, the crunchy bacon (Lardons) on the salad really elevated it.  Breakfast #1:  Went with the buffet and had them make me a custom omelette: Spinach, mushrooms, onions, and two kinds of cheese. Plus some bacon and smoked salmon on the side. I added some chopped red onions and capers on the smoked salmon. The omelette was really good. Also had a glass of V-8 juice, coffee, and water. Coffee was strong and good.  Dinner #2:  Had dinner in room. Ordered the Truffle Mac & Cheese (Marscapone, Chive, Parmesan Crisp), an order of the Hand Cut Salt Salt Fries (served with a Malt Vinegar Aioli), and the Natural Free Range Chicken Wings (ordered extra crispy) (served with Buffalo Sauce, Celery Leaves, and Pickled Carrots).  The Truffle Mac & Cheese was very creamy and oh so good! I did add some black pepper and some hot sauce to it - as that is how I roll. The fries were hot and crispy, and the wings were cooked extra crispy as I requested.  Breakfast #2:  Again - went with the buffet and had them make me another custom omelette: Spinach, mushrooms, onions, and fresh jalapeños. They pulled out some pickled jalapeños - which are not very good in an omelette. So they went and got some fresh ones to add - and two kinds of cheese. Plus some bacon and biscuits and sausage gravy on the side.  Omelette was awesome, bacon was tasty. But the biscuits were hard, they had been on the buffet to long, and the sausage gravy, while tasty, had been out a bit to long.  Also had a glass of V-8 juice, coffee, and water. Coffee was strong and good.  Service was very good each time."}
{"text":"The quality-to-price ratio is lower than I would have expected. The food isn't bad quality, but honestly, if there's a place open that delivers or you can go pick food up from somewhere else, it's easy to find a better option. This place is really best if you're just looking for a meal before bed at the Marriott and don't much care about the dollars-and-cents of it."}
{"text":"6 of us dined there on Saturday night. All of the food we ordered was terrific. Everything from the fries to the double pork chop were excellent. Very large and diverse beer list. This is a hidden gem, too bad it's in a cheesy hotel. This restaurant needs to be in a hip location and would be one of the top restaurants in Cleveland"}
{"text":"In the past couple of months, I can honestly say that I have eaten here too many times to count or even care to check-in. The concept of the restaurant is fresh farm to table so the menu changes with the seasons. When compared to other Marriott restaurants, it does have a nice variety. The food is can be hit and miss.   If you are in a hurry, I would recommend that you sit in the actual restaurant and not in the bar, as depending on how crowed it can get, you can wait awhile. The nice thing about the menu is that they can make a hand full of the dishes Gluten Free. The bar is pretty well stocked with a variety of beers and hard liquors. One of the downsides to AMP is that it closes exactly at midnight, including the bar.  Service can be hit and miss as well. If you are in a hurry, I would recommend sitting in the actual restaurant and not the bar as it can get crowded.   Overall, if you are staying at the hotel and don't have a car or want to drive for food, AMP is pretty much your only sit down restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"We are staying at the Marriot and how lucky to have this delicious restaurant here! We've enjoyed many breakfast and dinner and all have been amazing! The service is also very nice and would definitely recommend it. The egg white omelette is really good and their english muffins are delicious."}
{"text":"The pana cotta was the best dessert I've ever ordered in a restaurant."}
{"text":"I had not been since Chef Cooley left, so I had to go do some investigative eating. I'm delighted to report that the quality of the food is just as good and wonderfully imaginative under Chef Jarrett. There were some tweaks: two entrees north of $30 have been added (a ribeye and a halibut, presumably for the expense account set), and the tasting menus have been upped by $5 (but are still a good value). I had the flatbread with with goat cheese and mushrooms, the celery root soup, and a mahi mahi entree, and I was really happy with everything. I'm relieved that not much has changed here."}
{"text":"My family and I are here for lunch and dinner...  We all ordered different things and  everything was great!  Chicken curry soup is very good and the chicken on the salad was nice and juicy."}
{"text":"I've come to believe that when a chef skillfully combines his talent with his passion, truly amazing food is made.  I loved my evening at AMP 150, not only because of how well our meal was executed, but because Chef Ellis Cooley loves what he does and shares his passion.  It's in his conversation and it's on his plates.  I started with a mushroom soup.  It was velvety and complex in flavor.  I could have sworn there was a heart attack of butter in it, but the chef explained his method which included whipping for texture and a combination of stocks for flavor without making the soup heavy with butters and creams.  My main was grilled lamb.  Served over a robust white bean and margeze ragout, the lamb was tender with the perfect amount of pink. By this point in the meal I had been entirely sated.  Then came dessert.  Lemongrass crème brulee.   The crème brulee itself was delicate in flavor and consistency, but was paired with a knock-you-down strong lemon sorbet.  The chef took the time to make rounds in the dining room.  He spoke about cost saving (my entire three courses totaled $21.00), ordering seafood not served elsewhere in Cleveland, and his quest for the perfect cut of lamb.  The chef spoke of this plans for the future - brunch, experiments with house cured meats, and vegetables grown on site.  And as he spoke, I came to understand the smile I had had on my face since my first spoonful of soup.  This man is passionate about what he is doing.  It shows in the long hours he works, the huge smile on his face as the talks about his craft, and the food - it really is exquisite."}
{"text":"Based on a number of positive reviews, I'm guessing we just had a bad luck day. Went here for breakfast on a Saturday morning. We were seated immediately, checked out the buffet and decided to order off the menu instead. Hubby was disappointed that the corned beef hash listed online wasn't available, but he ordered something else so all was ok. I ordered eggs Benedict and my son ordered the short rib hash. After about 15 minutes the waiter stopped by and said our food would be out momentarily. 5 minutes later he came out to inform us that they didn't actually have any short rib hash...seriously? Took them 20 minutes to realize this? So, my son had to order something else and we all waited again for our food. We were glad to finally receive it, although the two that were done earlier were pretty cold by this point. I will say our waiter was very gracious and our meals were comped, so for a free meal it wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Pleasant. Surprise.  Normally I reject anything in a hotel, as I'm big on character and atmosphere of a restaurant. But I'm glad I gave this place a chance. The atmosphere is very modern, loungey (hotel-y) and stylish with these crazy curtained booths in the middle of the room (I really wish we had sat in one of those).   Well they had one of my very favorite wines (Dornfelder - a must if you like sweet reds), so that was a grand start. My boyfriend ordered the short rib ('twas baller), and I ordered the watermelon salad (holy crap; baller), and the mussels (a unique, flavorful alternative to your run-of-the-mill lemon butter mussels). The menu is REALLY masterfully designed, such that you can pretty much eat well here on any budget and any appetite, by mixing-and-matching menu items to try several of the many interesting plates. While they did what they could, I don't love the hotel location, or the hotel-feel of the restaurant itself, hence the 4 stars. But I've already recommended the place and I'm so glad we found it!"}
{"text":"This is my second visit in one day. This place is amazing and our server is extremely attentive to our needs. Thank you Susan for your excellent service."}
{"text":"pleasantly surprised by Amp 150. my mom and I pick a restaurant every two weeks and try it out. we walked in and it was slow. we were going to try the chefs tasting menu bit wanted to try an.array of things so we just dove in and ordered.   all of out selections were very good. the rabbit stew.was very homey but needed something to take it to the next level. The pork belly was cooked perfectly(I am a.sucker for the belly!) and the whole plate.was delicious. the ideas are there just AMP up the flavor a bit and it will be amazing!   our server was great and was patient and explained all of our dishes t us as they came out, we will definitely go back to try some.of the other selections because the prices allow you to do so."}
{"text":"The decor: very middle eastern; could have been an Indian restaurant but it was done well.  I sat in a wonderful circular booth that provided a lot of privacy.    The food: very good with different flavor profiles.  The menu is similar to farm to table restaurants but they don't combine the flavors as well as other places have.  This is my only complaint.  All of the dishes taste great if you get a small amount of everything on your plate into one bite.  However, the ingrediants are not evenly distributed to be able to do so.  for instance, the squash soup was delicious with a marshmallow on the spoon, but there were only two tiny marshmallows... and it was mediocre without the marshmallows.   The service was quick and it was not very crowded. We went on a weekend and got seated quickly.  The winter martini had almost no alcohol in it, so I had to get two drinks that evening.  That was the only other thing I can say that I would have changed.  Overall it was a nice atmosphere and the prices were very affordable.  However, I think Deagens was better for the price."}
{"text":"One server and a bunch of guests waiting everywhere. Not a convenient place for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"Pretty damn good place.  Especially for a hotel restaurant .  I had 2 appetizers and a salad and it was about right.  Service was good and friendly.  Also the place was staffed appropriately, given that I'm here for a convention.    Bar has a decent selection of liquor.  I didnt check out the beers or wines but they have a list so the selection must be good."}
{"text":"As much as people may disagree with me on this review, I give AMP 150 a five star rating. I'm not sure how much my review will change with the new chef that supposedly is taking over (or already has taken over?), but nonetheless, five stars.  My foodie co-workers and I ventured out to AMP 150 one night for dinner. After looking over the menu at work, we all commented \"let's get the tasting menu!\" and off we went.  I love the tasting menu here. 45 bucks for 6 courses? What a steal. Even better, everyone who orders a tasting menu at your table, each gets a DIFFERENT 6 courses. All in all? We got 18 different plates, with 2 extra plates for added plus. Jeesh. We were stuffed by the end of the meal.  Free tastings: Chicken liver pate with green mint jam: Interesting concept, as it came on toasted bread. I....thought the mint jam was too much. But, my co-worker loved it?  Mushroom vegetable soup: AMAZING. Not too salty, super flavorful, and very heartwarming. It came in this itty bitty cup....but man, it was packed with flavors. I always hate trying soups (due to the overload of salt), but this was just right.   Courses 2: Salads- bib lettuce, calamari salad, and edamame falafel salad. Of course I liked the falafel the best. The rest were good as well.  Courses 3: Mussels in plum wine and coconut milk, baby bok choy,and rabbit. All of them were flavorful and tasty. I really liked the mussels (you would think plum wine+coconut milk would be extremely weird...but actually was quite good). The bok choy...I could have made. haha. But the rabbit was super tender and flavorful as well.  Course 4: Hak fish with sweet potato, Cod in clam chowder sauce, and scallops in squid ink. I loved the fish and the scallops. My co-worker loved the clam chowder.  Course 5: Lamb, flank steak, and chicken. All of these were GIGANTIC portions. The lamb was pretty amazing- super tender.....as well as the flank steak. The chicken was a little bit on the dry side...but still good.  Course 6:  Milk chocolate panne cotta, sweet potato trifle cake, and a berry tart with amaretto ice cream. My favorite was definitely the panne cotta- oh so light and good. But really....the guys were full by the end of the meal, leaving me the dessert. Why yes, I'll finish those off for you....  Definitely a yum-licious meal. I'm not sure how the restaurant will change with the new chef, but hey, when I went, it was definitely superb."}
{"text":"A very nice place to relax. After a sweaty disgusting run, I wasn't sure if it was worth it to go through the effort of putting on my pants again to go down stairs, but I was very glad I did. The seating is spacious, open, and comfortable.   I can't speak to the drinks but the food is good. Menu has an appropriate number of options, and I've enjoyed each thing I've eaten as I've stayed here. I don't know that it's a draw for me if I'm not staying in the hotel, but if you're already here, no need to go off-campus. You've got a terrific option just steps away from your room."}
{"text":"So I went to Amp 150 very wary about the \"eating in a lobby\" situation. Turns out that I had nothing to worry about! Had a great experience.  It started with wonderful service from our server. You could tell she was excited about the farm to table concept.  We started out with some cocktails. The strawberry basil martini and the carmel apple martini were delectable. My fiancee was very impressed with the beer list that even includes the hard to find German smoked beer Aecht Schlenkerla (although $10 IS a bit pricey for a beer even if it is a big one!)  The mussels were very tasty and came in a huge portion. My only complaint would be that their homemade Chinese sausage was barely like Chinese sausage at all. Don't get me wrong, it was good, just not similar to Chinese sausage.  We tried both a pumpkin panzanella (scrumptious!) and the chopped salad. Both portions were again huge!  I can't remember all the small bites we tried, but they were all tasty. The cod came with a great sauce (certainly not healthy!) - the edamame falafel was nice and crispy on the outside and tasty on the inside - the scallops were perfectly cooked.  The person that ordered the braised lamb was a little surprised at the amount of fat on the piece of meat, but I believe that's mandatory to achieve tenderness. The meal was also huge as it contained two good sized cuts of meat.  Can't complain about desert either. The baked apple provided just the touch of fall I needed. My friends loved the panna cotta, although I wasn't too sure about it. Personal palate issue I guess. :)  And really, by the end of the evening, I had no idea that I was sitting in the Marriott lobby. Who cares with all that good food to try!!"}
{"text":"Decent little place for an airport hotel.  I was unexpectedly delayed here and got stuck in Cleveland for the night.   Their food was very good.. i had a cuban sandwich with spaghetti squash.  It was all cooked well and flavored really well.  They also had 21st Amendment Hell or High Watermelon available... this was nice as we don't have it in Indiana.  Only complain was that my side of squash was something absurd like $7.. but good thing for me is that American Airlines gave me a voucher for dinner.. so they were sorta free since the voucher was for $7.    The service was good and they got the food out quickly.. was happy to see this as it had been too long of a day."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to dining here, and really wanted to like it more than I did, but...  First of all, we had reservations, arrived early, and despite the restaurant being significantly empty on a Saturday night, we waited almost half an hour to be seated.    Our server was informative but also a bit curt, which made our group feel a bit uncomfortable.    The food was a mixed bag.  The bread (from Breadsmith) and spreads were excellent.  I really enjoyed the rabbit cavetelli, and another member of our party loved the pork loin.  The Chicken flatbread was inconsistent.  Some bites were good, and others were overpowered with rosemary.  The other member of our party just didn't care for the cod.  The honey vanilla ice cream was wonderful, but also provided by and outside source (Jeni's in Columbus).   So as far as the actual food, the experience was really a 50/50.  If I were travelling and staying at the hotel with no other options, I would be very happy to have access to a place like this.   Based on the rest of the experience, and the number of other great places in town, I don't think we'll be going back.    One suggestion:  The restaurant is not very clearly deliniated from the hotel lobby.  This REALLY took away from the ambience as far as our group was concerned.  Perhaps if we had been seated toward the rear it would have been better, but our table was only separated from the lobby by a chest high wall.  It made the place feel less special than it should."}
{"text":"There was nothing wrong with AMP 150, I was just very underwhelmed. We had the four course Valentine's Day dinner. My boyfriend had the red pepper soup and enjoyed it very much, but there were no standouts after that. There was a general sense of blandness and a lack of salt in everything. We had the surf and turf with heirloom carrots, arugula salad, pork belly with mustard green ragout, and crab ravioli and they didn't live up to expectations. My boyfriend did enjoy his banana split dessert, featuring bananas foster ice cream.  I will say that the server went above and beyond to ensure my dietary restrictions were met. A big plus for anyone doing whole 30 or paleo, or suffering from food allergies.  Other than that the courses came out very slowly and the ambiance was thrown off by kids running through the lobby and patrons in the connected bar watching a hockey game.   I've heard great things about the tasting menu and food, so I may try again, but I'm not rushing back anytime soon.  My boyfriends input \"I thought it was okay, sweetie.\" No other edits from the ball and chain."}
{"text":"The restaurant decor and layout is very cool. There are tables designed just for large groups. The staff was friendly and attentive. It wasn't very busy so the kitchen service was quick. The food was cooked well; simply. I got the Squash Soup and the Swordfish. They were both good, but the fish was nothing that knocked my socks off. If you don't find something you like check back later as their menu changes often. Which brings me to my only con. I had seen Hanger Steak online on the menu but it wasn't on the menu in the restaurant anymore... Note this restaurant is in the Marriott Hotel just off the highway so is very easy to get to. It is right in the main hotel doors to the right - the bar blends right into the lobby."}
{"text":"If tonight was any indication, don't believe the hype. The service was excellent - no problems there. Started with the bread. Nothing spectacular, the bread was similar to Portuguese sweet bread. And it got worse as it cooled and began to taste stale.  For the main course, I got the flank steak with a red wine reduction. It was presented stacked on cold mashers. The meat was cooked med rare, but was much tougher than it should have been.  My guest had the seared hake, with clams and shrimp. The hake was ok, but no interesting flavor. The clams and shrimp were overcooked and bland. Finished with a churro with spiced chocolate and a chocolate sauce. Well it had flavor, which was a change from the main course. Unfortunately, it wasn't a good one.  I really wanted to like this place. The reviews got me pumped for a great experience. Then I spent half the dinner explaining away the disappointment to my guest. But eventually ran out of excuses and the disappointment set in.  Perhaps others are beginning to agree with me based on the empty restaurant (lobby) on a friday night."}
{"text":"Food: Very good, and not just because it's in the Cleveland Hopkins restaurant desert. My table did the bajillion course tasting menu. The menu changes seasonally, but my favorites were the fried squash blossoms, chicken liver pate with blueberry jam, rabbit with spatzle, and the seafood soup (coconutty broth).  Service: We had late reservations, and by the time we were done eating, the restaurant was closed. Despite that, the service was very good. Our server was helpful and every time a new course came out, a chef came to explain each dish to us.  Price: Really unbelievably cheap for the tasting menu. Definitely worth it.  Cleanliness & Ambiance: The restaurant was clean. UGH! HOTEL THO! WHYYYY. I hate eating in hotels, you know? It's kinda awkward. Especially on W. 150th. But the location is really the only semi-bad thing about Amp 150."}
{"text":"Yes, this restaurant is in a hotel, a Marriott hotel, but don't let that sway your opinion in the least bit.   There is nothing about AMP 150 that makes you think run of the mill hotel restaurant.  Amp goes way beyond bar food and provides you with a great and ever changing seasonal menu utilizing only that which is fresh.  Nothing in their restaurant comes out of a can or box. In the summer they even have a garden out back from which they harvest  most of the vegetables they use in their dishes at that time. I've been to AMP 150 well over a dozen times whether it was a drink and a bite to eat at the bar waiting before picking a friend up at the airport or a dinner in their private dining room the food is always outstanding.  Since the menu changes on a very regular basis I won't bother giving you specific menu recommendations because that will only leave you disappointed if they aren't on the menu.  So what do I suggest you order then you might ask? The Chef's Tasting.  Amp offers a 4 and 6 course tasting menu chosen by the chef.  They do however let you give some input if you must but I suggest let the chef surprise you.  Every time I've done the chef's tasting I always feel I'm getting the best of the best based on what's in season.   If you are slightly less adventurous, I'd suggest giving a try to the appetizer and soup sections along with the small plates.  That's not to say their large plates aren't good but I tend to prefer variety to quantity.  The small plates just allow you to try two different dishes of good portion size at the same price as one of the larger plates.  They have a nice variety in the appetizer section and the soups always taste as fresh as the vegetables in them.  As far as the desserts go, I'd highly suggest saving room.  While they change as often as the regular menu it always keeps me trying something new and more often then not I'm happy with it. The other nice thing about Amp 150 is their beer selection.  They have a fairly extensive beer selection and while not the best in the city it is much better than most restaurants. My only complaint about Amp 150 would be the service. While the experiences are not always bad, I have had some less than stellar service from time to time but it doesn't stop me from going and it shouldn't stop you from trying it. After all, really good food can make up for just about anything in my book and Chef Ellis Cooley has come through every time. In closing, if you haven't been to AMP 150 yet, YOU MUST GO. Not next month, tomorrow. It is what I'd consider one of the Top 10 restaurants in Cleveland and the best food for the value for sure."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in the West Park neighborhood. The staff has consistently been friendly and attentive. The menu changes often to incorporate seasonal flavors and ingredients, so it's hard to give a recommendation on what to order. It's always fun to try the Chef's Tasting, but make sure to bring your appetite."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner on a quieter Monday night where the four of us sat very comfortably at a round booth.  Our server and busser were both VERY nice but a little doting and too-present, occasionally.  The manager, Peter was delightful to chat with and even shared with us a lovely Greek wine, the 2009 Domaine Tselepos Mantinia Moschofilero which we all enjoyed tremendously.  Definitely on my radar as a top-notch Cleveland restaurant.  Adventurous menu that encourages tastings of many small dishes."}
{"text":"For being in a hotel I was surprised at how good the food was. We were staying in the hotel and didn't feel like going far so simply went downstairs. Waitress was super sweet, can't say enough about her, sadly don't remember her name. I'd consider myself a picky eater but I am a meat fanatic so I of course got the steak, 17 oz filet mignon,  medium. Came out a bit on the rarer side but that doesn't bother me just as long as it's not over cooked! The mashed potatoes literally might be the best I've ever had, and I eat a lot of mashed potatoes. I was actually sad when I finished them. Salad portions are huge and not too expensive. The music was great, being in Cleveland it was mostly rock over the speakers, pleasantly surprised to hear Fleetwood Mac playing lol. There were people on buisness there in suits all the way to people in jeans and leggings, so dress code is not a huge deal at all. Just wish the menu was a little bigger but what they did have all sounded great. Would eat here again if I came back! I should add that their menu is seasonal, i was here very early April, so I can only go off that seasons menu."}
{"text":"I have been to AMP many times but I am focusing on an often overlooked dining category.  AMP 150's kids meals are the best I have ever seen. Ordered the kids mac n cheese and it was definitely chef made with lots of cheesy goodness.  They do not serve the instant blue box stuff like some other places do.  Also came with a drink, and large servings of fresh cut fruit and a vegetable medley.  Wow!  If I could, I would order the kid's meal for lunch :) Definitely plenty to take home and eat the next day."}
{"text":"Overpriced and very little flavor. Portion sizes are also extremely small. The only thing I enjoyed was their salad.  During my stay I had the Salmon ($22) and the Half Roasted Chicken ($22). The salmon was decent but the chicken had NO flavoring. The plate was also smeared with what tasted like my son's baby food squash. Do not recommend!"}
{"text":"We arrived to the hotel a little after 8pm following a 6 hour drive with hungry bellies and low expectations for dinner at this restaurant (only because in my experience restaurants in hotels rarely deliver). BUT, this place was a pleasant surprise and I would highly recommend not overlooking it, whether you are staying at the Marriott or not.  The staff was all very nice (i.e. the host who sat us, our server, and the food runners who brought us our grub). Everything was very clean and comfortable, decorated just as an upscale restaurant would be (note: we were *not* dressed upscale and it was aOK). Most importantly though, everything we had was good and tasted fresh.   They offered a variety of things for sharing (and as entrees), all of which I wanted in my mouth. So, we got an eclectic mix: the watermelon salad, a cup of coconut curry chicken soup, deviled eggs, fried pickles and beef cheek pierogis. The watermelon salad was my favorite, though I thought the dehydrated olives (while tasty) were a bit misplaced. The pierogis were great, as were the deviled eggs, but I'd probably not get the pickles again...not that there was anything wrong with them per se; they were just not my jam. My Dad also enjoyed the flavors of his soup, but thought they lent themselves more to a cream base, which this was not...maybe just a preference thing. Overall though, everything on the menu looked excellent and I would definitely return to try other things.   High fives, elevated expectations & full bellies all around!"}
{"text":"Great food and local beer selection.   The employees are extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and Cleveland in general.  Worth the stop if you are in the area or staying at the Marriott."}
