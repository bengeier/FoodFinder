{"text":"Best selection of solid craft beers I have seen in a long time!

The owner was extremely friendly and helpful!  
They have really great taste in the beer selection they have!"}
{"text":"Bravo! The perfect little shop to pick up amazing craft beer! I'm so impressed with this place and will be coming here as often as I can to stock up on delicious brews! Great job!"}
{"text":"My new favorite neighbor in downtown Phoenix. A small but well edited beer and wine shop, with particular focus on beer and a growing focus on ciders. They offer many of their selections by both the bottle and pack, and they have an eight-handle growler fill station.

A fantastic addition the neighborhood and one who will be getting a good chunk of the money I would be giving to the big box chain stores."}
{"text":"Came here for a follow up after I saw they added a deli to this place.  There's no seating inside so if you're coming here for a sandwich, you're getting it to go.  I got the All Americano.  Turkey, Roast Beef, American Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Mayo, Mustard, Oil and Vinegar on white bread.  Came with a pickle.  Total cost including tax, about $10.  Pretty solid sandwich.  Generous qualities of turkey and roast beef and a good clean taste profile.  Would love to have the option to toast my sandwich along with seating, but its a good start.  And as with last time, the beer and wine selection inside is quite impressive despite the relatively small size of the space.  And now, a good spot to get a sandwich to go for lunch, dinner, or late night."}
{"text":"Alright - seems everyone is reviewing this place on the basis of their awesome arsenal of beer & wine and other fine beverages. But let's pause for a second and recognize just how amazing this spot is on the Deli front. Let me expand:

This short tale begins on a pleasant (read: not brutally hot) evening in Phoenix. I'm a Cali-kid at heart, and being new to AZ, I was excited to check out this \"First Friday\" hype. Cool stuff. Fast forward to me sliding by Flowers and bumping into this dope dude named Mike, allegedly the resident sandwich slanger and fellow sandwich connoisseur. 

Let me bring this amazing adventure to a screeching halt and clarify a few crucial points. Me? I'm a sandwich guy. Take the dude you know who loves sandwiches more than any other dude you know, multiple by 11ty, and you have me. With that out of the way, let's continue...

Anyway, Mike and I; being Sandwich-loving-homies and all (yes, I capitalized Sandwich), dove into a full fledged sandy oriented convo which ultimately led to me having the opportunity to try one of his ultimate concoctions. I ended up wandering off into the crowd and chaos while simultaneously devouring this epic SANDWICH. Notice the all CAPS? That's how epic. 

As I lingered through the crowd eating this delicious beast like a rabid animal, I almost bumped into or knocked over several innocent bystanders.

To sum things up, Mike is the man, Flowers is the spot, and yeah, I now have a new favorite deli. Yee!"}
{"text":"Great selection of craft beer and wine in the Roosevelt Row neighborhood!  Great atmosphere inside and the staff was really helpful with making recommendations based on our preferences."}
{"text":"We had heard about this place for months and it lived up to the hype. They have a ton of great selections of beer and wine to take home. They have several options on tap to fill up bombers or growlers. Besides that, they have hundreds of beer options with everything from bombers to six packs. It was so hard to make a decision and we look forward to returning and picking out some more great brews! It is expensive and the total adds up very quickly, but they have beers you won't find anywhere else downtown. I highly recommend a stop in here, even just to check it out. Also, a big bonus is the great and friendly service."}
{"text":"I was waiting for this place to open and Iam glad they did! I live around the corner and they have a huge selection of craft/microbrews and they have growlers witch makes a few spots in the area that I can fill'er up at. The service is what you would expect from a local owned shop. I guess they will be selling flowers soon? I could care less. hahahaha!!! great addition to the ROW."}
{"text":"Great specialty beer and wine shop in downtown. Staff is friendly and enthusiastic about where the business is going. I hear they will be opening up a deli soon so you can go in for a nice sandwich and craft beer- what more could you want?! Looking forward to seeing this place grow!"}
{"text":"The perfect place to scoop up a gift for the beer connesiur in your life.  A bit pricey,  but the cost reflects the quality. 

I've been meaning to stop in here,  but I finally had a legitimate excuse to blow cash on booze with Christmas right around the corner - so glad I did! 

The dude at the counter was super friendly and gave me several recommendations to point me in the right direction. 

A much needed addition to downtown, will gladly be returning soon. Support Local my dudes!"}
{"text":"Stopped by while biking home. I have been anticipating their opening since I first saw a feature  in the Phoenix New Times. The moment I walked in, I knew I'd love it. They have an extensive selection of craft brews, an exceptionally friendly staff who clearly loves their beer, cool DIY-style decor, and a good lineup of taps. Pricing may be a bit higher than your local supermarket or Total Wine, but it is absolutely worth supporting your local downtown business. Downtown Phoenix is booming and this store is a very welcome addition to our growing city. 

I will be going back and filling my growler with some Bell's Two-Hearted."}
{"text":"If you are like me, choice is mind-shatteringly overwhelming. One choice permanently leads life through one particular sequence of events. Simultaneously, with that choice, dozens of other unique sequences are effectively deleted from this world. The act of choosing one form of enlightenment leads to the ignorance of all other forms at that particular moment for that particular shape of that particular universe. A hallway of open doors, all slamming shut as I walk through one. Forever banished from the taste of their truths.

With stakes so colossal, analysis paralysis takes hold. 

Thats what was happening to me in Flowers today. Like Neo, I had a choice to make. A choice that would forever change my life, my perception, my sanity.
 
What beer do I want?

A stout? An amber? An IPA? A Wheat Beer? A Pale Ale? 

Each beer coming with its own unique, irreversible sequence to forever alter my life

Lucky, the guy was super helpful. I told him what I like generally and he made a suggestion. That suggestion made sense to me, so I bought it. Now I am at home drinking it and it feels good.

Love this Anderson Valley Holy Gose Ale

Love this Sun Up White Russian Imperial Coffee Stout

What the other paths held, I will never know.

But I am okay not knowing for now. Because I am happy

He saved me.

Thanks."}
