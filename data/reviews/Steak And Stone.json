{"text":"Great place place for food, conversation, and views. If you want to relax with family or friends THIS IS THE PLACE! The concept is great and the server Ashley made the experience even better. Great choices of steaks and it was fun cooking on the rock on our table. My wife wanted to touch the rock we cooked on but our sever did no recommend it as it is 500 Plus degrees. I can't wait to bring all of my friends and some of my family to enjoy good food and the experience. I love introducing people to a new and exciting food experience. I will be back next week with my friends."}
{"text":"We just had our first dinner at this restaurant and both my date and I were amazed!  Not quite sure what we had run into with this cook your own steak at the table on a rock, but we loved it.  This unique system allowed her to cook small strips of her filet to the perfect \" medium rare \" that she prefers and it all stayed piping hot.  It was a Friday and since they had prime rib available that was my choice.  It was a great cut of meat and smoked with a wonderful flavor through and though.  The staff took exceptional care of us and the owner came by several times to check on our meal and chat with us.  We had a great experience and will be back very soon.  I don't think I have ever given 5 stars to any place but this one is as close as it gets!  Definitely give them a try....you won't regret it...and their prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Good concept, bad execution!   This place used to be good, but the clientele, the atmosphere, and service has been terrible the past 3 times ive been here. For starters, oh wait...you'll have to wait 15+ minutes to see a waiter for a glass of water. They yelled at my friend for having his water bottle at the table as we waited for any sort of service.   Secondly, the menu is so poorly designed. You have no idea what are sides and what actually comes with the meal. The salad/side bar is so sad, its a open buffet style.   Thirdly, the atmosphere is pretty lame considering its on a airport tarmac which could be cool in theory. Also, no one is younger than 55 here.   Last but not least, the hostess took my friends phone number from our reservation and contacted him personally a few days later. Not professional and an invasion of privacy, speaking on their behalf.   Its a shame because cooking steak on a stone is delicious, but they need help here to make it less of a mess. Also, why are children allowed around 800+ degree stones?!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the experience, but it was a bit on the pricy side. The tri-tip came out cooked (smoked beforehand?), so putting it on the rock made the cook more than my husband wanted. Will go back."}
{"text":"I'm not sure they were prepared in the kitchen for a packed house. The food took well over an hour, but we were a large group. The food is good and the concept is interesting, especially if you eat beef which I don't. But they have salmon and it was delicious. The waitstaff were working very hard and the highlight of the evening was James\" who I believe was a busser. What a cool young man! He's a keeper :)"}
{"text":"WOW! My family and I just had dinner here and I can't express what a truly awesome time we had. Outstanding service and a sweet view of the sunset over Falcon Field. My son and I ordered the filet mignon on a slab of stone as large as his torso. A super unique idea, you cant complain about how your steak is done because you ARE the chef! Really just a rustic, fun and lively atmosphere. We will return after my Crestor prescription gets refilled. Seriously folks, if you like meat this is THE place. I cant seem to get that opening line...Flintstones meet the Flintstones... out of my mind. Well I'm going go drift off into a food coma now.........."}
{"text":"Fun concept!  Nice addition to the area. A bit overpriced compare to some other hidden gems in the area, but overall very happy with the experience."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Big mistake. There were 3 tables going and the service sucked.  Salad bar needs work. Cucumbers and lettuce just sitting in water. They don't even have regular Italian or simple vinegar and oil.  No bread offered and asked for parmesan cheese for zucchini appetizer and never got it. We will try it once more for dinner and hope i won't be unsatisfied a second time.."}
{"text":"Made reservations for a belated Father's Day, excellent service, excellent food, I hope to come back soon!!!  Anissa was a excellent server. Very patient, knowledgeable and sweet. The service you can only hope for!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed first visit so much couldn't wait to come back. Excellent Service and Great Food!  Hamburger is best we've had in a long time. Didn't try the steak but will come back for that. Steaks brought out on 500 degree stone and you cook it at your table. Very neat experience. Also nice to watch planes come in."}
{"text":"Love the services and the atmosphere is wonderful. Love it! Can't wait to come back. Kerri was a great waitress! We will ask for her again!"}
{"text":"I think me and boyfriend found our new favorite steak restaurant! Tony was so nice and patient with us, being it was our first time!  Definitely will be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"I just started working in this side of town and I rely on Yelp for good reviews. I am a foodie. After reading the reviews I thought I should try this place. What a disappointment. I ordered the build your own burger, and I must say it was the least appetizing burger I have had in a long time. I won't be back."}
{"text":"The Gilbert location is much nicer and has a better salad bar than the Mesa location.  You can't beat the price of a good 6 ounce sirloin with a side and salad bar for 12.99.  And you get to cook it how you want it with the added options of lemon butter or bourbon glaze.  Add the rolls with honey butter and a full bar makes this a pretty good choice."}
{"text":"Great place with a novel concept to cooking your own steak Very helpful servers One of the real great places to eat"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great service and the most amazing food. Cooking a steak on a stone just feels manly."}
{"text":"First time here. Enjoyed it very much. My friend and I split the rib eye. You cook it on a hot stone to your liking.  They have seasonings for you to use at the table. They brought out a bourbon glaze to sample with the steak, it was sooo good. I used the rest on my half of the steak. I highly recommend trying it. :-) The salad bar is good. They have an option to use the hot bar for a side item instead of something from the kitchen, but there weren't many toppings at the hot bar for the baked potato, if you choose to go that route. The atmosphere is nice but casual. Would be a good place for a family dinner celebration. Erica was our server and she was great!  Go out and give this new business a shot. It's a different concept so come prepared for a new experience. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A couple of colleagues and I stopped in by chance for lunch the other day.  The place is really cool.  The front door isn't clearly marked but you eventually find your way in.  I never thought that a place where you cook your meat at the table on a large stone would ever be opened in the US - too much risk having a 600 F stone at the table - but I'm glad they did.  While I did not have the opportunity to try a steak, the lunch buffet was well worth it as well.  For $12.95, they offer an all you can eat salad, soup, pasta and taco buffet.  My colleagues spoke well of the soup (I'm just not a soup guy), and the salad bar and taco bar were excellent.  The salad had crisp lettuce, and all three buffets (salad, pasta and taco) had a ton of options to choose from.  The taco meat was juicy and tasty, and they had shredded cabbage in the taco bar - doing it right.  There was a lot of good food.  My only complaint would be that it was kind of slow getting out of there - getting the check took forever.  With most people getting the lunch buffet, there's just not a need to have a lot of staff, so I get it.  My next trip I will plan accordingly and ask earlier."}
{"text":"Great concept. Cook your own steak, your way. Perfect. Every bite is hot and tasty. Eight in are party on christmas eve, all had a different cut of meat. All very tasty. Baked potato, cream corn, sweet potatoes, salads all very good. Servers were very attentive. I would recommend trying this experience. Prices very reasonable"}
{"text":"Overall, we were disappointed with the service, but the food was good. We came here for a casual dinner on a Wednesday night. We arrived at 5:20 and left at 6:50. We were sat immediately, but waited 20 minutes for someone to bring water and take our order. The food arrived about 20 minutes after that, but no drinks. We got the 6 oz filet and 12 oz New York strip, with salad bar, sweet potato fries, sweet cream corn, and garlic mashed potatoes. The food was good, and the instruction we received to cook it ourselves was good. The stone was immensely hot; I can't imagine coming here in the summer time. We realized after a while that our waitress was also assigned the party room which had a group of about 30 people who say down just after us. It took another 20-25 minutes to get our bill after we finished eating. In fact, 3 bus boys approached us at 3 different times asking what we were waiting for. They needed the table for waiting guests. The manager approached us, and I told him we were disappointed in the service. He offered us a free dessert which we declined. When I mentioned I never received the Coke I ordered, he said their Coke machine was down. Nobody told us that earlier, and they never offered to bring different drinks. When we were finally able to pay the bill, we stood up to leave, and realized we were blocked in by a serving cart. After about 4 minutes of standing there waiting, another server moved the cart so we could leave. For $65, even though it's a unique experience, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!!!  Went here on a Monday night, 40 minute wait eased by beers at Desert Eagle Brewing that's attached.  The wait was worth it.  Beautiful cuts of beef, melt in your mouth tenderness, cooked your own way on a stone right in front of you.  There are non-steak options, but why would you?!?! Attentive, but not annoying staff, even the owner came out multiple times going around tables genuinely wanting to know how everything was.  We will be coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"The monsoon storm brought us here and in so glad it did. I had the Molcajete Lava bowl with beef and it was so good. I highly recommend it if you love hot and spicy. I will be back to try their other menu items."}
{"text":"Not good.  Cafeteria food at best.  Canned gravy on mashed potatoes, overcooked vegetables that were mostly potatoes, side dish served in plastic bowl in food truck type basket, slow service, wine served in champagne glass, no atmosphere... Concept is interesting but very disappointing for the price.  I really wanted to like it."}
{"text":"Hey great steak, atmosphere.  The server Stephanie was really great, she explained how to sear for best results....**** GOOD IDEA GREAT MEAL reasonably priced."}
{"text":"My new favorite place! The atmosphere is great! Everything is good. The sweet potato fries and coleslaw are the best one ever had. I also like that you get to cook your steak on a stone to the degree you want. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed eating here tonight.  We had steak and chicken and both were  very good.  It is unique cooking your own meat on a rock!   Our waitress was very helpful.  It is a fun atmosphere.  We sat inside due to windy conditions but will try the patio next time.  After our delicious meal we went to the bar for a drink. Mike B. Served us and gave us a great deal on Colorado Bulldogs ( happy hour).   Definitely will take our friends and family to this restaurant!  Oh and there is a great view of mountains and planes landing at Falcon Fields."}
{"text":"We were really excited to have a new restaurant in Mesa. It was a huge disappointment. We knew it was a \"concept\" restaurant-cooking your own steak on a hot stone at the table, but figured we would give it a try.  We were seated and it took our server 20 minutes to acknowledge us. It was busy, so we decided to order drinks and our meal at the same time.   We were brought bread while we waited. It's a good thing as it took 45 minutes for our raw steak to arrive.  The server brought our steaks and stones to the table. He proceeded to cut (butcher) our steaks into strips to facilitate the cooking. He wasn't even using a steak knife. When we asked why it took so long to be served he said it was because they didn't have enough hot sones because they were so busy.  After about 15 minutes it was clear our stones were not hot enough to cook our steaks appropriately. We flagged down our server and asked for to go boxes. He didn't ask why, but we told him our stones weren't hot enough and we would take the steaks home to cook them there. He did say he could bring us new hotter stones. We declined.  The steaks were pricey-$28 each. We wouldn't have minded had the service been better.   We won't be back."}
{"text":"Had a date night dinner with my wife. Never been here before. What a great experience. Cooked our own steaks at the table, steaks were very tender. Had the peach cobbler for dessert, AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Had a great visit at Steak & Stone at Falcon Field in Mesa!!!  Great atmosphere and our waiter, M Burlingame, made it even more enjoyable with his fun and low-key service!!  Great food and cooked on a stone at your table so you can cook it to the temperature and state of being done to your taste!!  Salad bar was lacking options and it was not kept up and stocked very well but overall a great fun and different dining option in Mesa/Scottsdale!!"}
{"text":"Super cool concept. The steak was amazing, and it was fun that I got to cook it on the lava stone. Their creamed corn was AMAZING!  Their cobbler and lava cake was amazing!  I guess what I am trying to say is:  this place is AMAZING!! Oh yeah.... and I was surprised to see that everything was so reasonably priced."}
{"text":"First time there. Called ahead but was told there was not many people there. Got there at 6 and she was right. Only about 20 people there. Bread and salad bar came with meal and was very good.  Was surprised by the concept of having a steak cooked on a red hot stone right in front of me. I cooked to my liking although the menu said we could request the kitchen to do it. Might be a good idea for small children as the stone is very hot. The hot bar consisted of a side of your choice. I had a huge baked potato. The service was just fine. Not a fancy place so wear your shorts and flip flops. When we left the place was packed. Noticed there was a separate room for a small private gathering.  Good to know."}
{"text":"Steak and Stone was one fun experience. The food here is great, but just a bit overpriced. The place can get pretty packed but that's because the food here is so delicious!   The steak here is really good, really really good. The service was great and our waiter was more than friendly. Love how sanitary it is and a great family place too !"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers. Steaks smelled awesome. Big salad bar and taco\rib\pasta bar. Jenna our waitress was wonderful. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I was sceptical at first, but it was actually a pretty cool and fun concept. I had the filet, which was so tender and delicious (minus the bourbon glaze that the waitress poured onto it. I was NOT happy about that at all!). The mac and cheese wasn't very good and we didn't get any bread because it apparently was cooking the entire time we were there. They still have a few kinks to work out and the ventilation needs work in there too. I came out smelling like the place. I would go back in a few months after they have their full menu going and give it another try."}
{"text":"Great idea steak cooked on lava rock very tender high quality meat quite a unique experience loved it."}
{"text":"Cool concept, decent food, horrendous service.    We were thrilled to try a new place in East Mesa but the hostesses were dreadful and overshadowed the experience of the actual meal.  Quoting us 45 minutes for two on a Saturday night was no big deal; but that turned into a 75 minute wait that allowed us to hear all the back and forth they told every guest.  Although, any guest who complained got seated within 5 minutes, regardless of their quoted wait time.  One of the managers must have sensed the general frustration and sent out plates of (COLD) appetizers to help fill the void. The most entertaining part was watching the hostesses write down a list of other restaurants and sending 3 guests to spend their money elsewhere!  The final impression was watching the two immature snarky hostesses talk trash about us in the reflection of the glass door as we finally left."}
{"text":"This is a great steakhouse, I love the concept, we have been here a couple of times, and every time has been amazing.  We came her tonight for our daughter's birthday, and it couldn't have been better. Brady was a wonderful waitress and Samantha loved that she could cook her own steak.  The prime rib was thick and tasty, my son loved watching the planes takeoff and land  The general manager was very gracious and interested in making sure we had a great experience... We will be back often"}
{"text":"Food was ok but could have been better if we knew how to cook. Didn't realize we had to cook our own food. The staff was helpful, but made for a stressful dinner. It was a new and unique experience and looking back now, it was kind of fun. I didn't appreciate the waiter referring to my wife as \"my daughter\". We are both 47 years old, and it was such a bullshit remark it was almost laughable, but very uncalled for."}
{"text":"The service and staff were incredible! The food was as good as advertised! Kerri was spectacular! Such a gem! I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it. I never would have believed a steak could be better than off of the grill, but this place proved me wrong. Our waiter Tony was fantastic, and our steaks were perfect. I went in thinking i was just going to enjoy a dinner with a gimmick (\"cooking your own steak\"), but it is much more than that. We will definitely be going back. The only downside was that my wife tried the dinner roll, the mushrooms, and the vegetables, and didn't care for any of them (hence the 4 stars), but Tony was extremely apologetic and offered samples of anything other sides she was interested in. We look forward to going back, and will be sure to ask for Tony when we do!"}
{"text":"Went shortly after they opened. Service was slow and the food overpriced and overrated."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food is super-fresh and served on a hot stone. What a great concept! I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"This was by far the best experience I have had at a Steak House.  The little loaf of bread that they give you to start off the meal with the cinnamon honey butter is the one thing you have to be careful of.  If you eat the whole thing as I did, you will end up being full before your meal is over, which is the one thing you don't want to do with how good this food is.  Do not under estimate the filling power of the little bread loaf.   For my order I got The Sliders & Philly Cheese Steak w/extra crispy fries.  The sliders happen to use the same bread as the loaf you start off with in the beginning.  So needless to say I was stuffed and only managed a few bites out of the awesome Philly Cheese Steak.  The staff is very friendly and on the ball in order to make sure everything about your meal is perfect.  The fact that you are able to cook your awesome cut of steak on a 500 degree stone is awesome.  If you like your steak blue rare, then you can cook it to blue rare.  If you like it charred you can cook it charred.  Needless to say this is a restaurant you will not regret."}
{"text":"The steak on the stone--awesome. Everything else... not so much. Worst bread at a steak place I've ever had, no exaggeration. And it didn't come out til we were almost done with our salad. We had to ask for refills several times. My husband ordered prime rib which had such a smokey flavor, he couldn't wait to smother it in horse radish. But we asked three times and waited 15 min to get it. Sides were average. My mil looked forward to key lime pie--they were out at 6 pm. On the other hand, they had bread pudding too and it was very yummy!! All in all good steak and dessert, awful service and other things were a disappointment. Not worth the ambiance of the sunset mountains and planes (but the beer next door was fab)."}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to try a new place for dinner we have been to a variety of steak houses in Sccottsdale but this place really blew us away. Last night we were celebrating her promotion and decided to try Steak and Stone due to reviews we had read.The  food was excellent. Our server Norah  was very pleasant and provided excellent service.Over all my wife and I agreed that this was one of the best dinners we have had in a long time ."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite steak houses in Arizona.  The experience is a lot of fun and the food is amazing!  Cooking your own steak on a stone...how fun!! Kacey was our server and she took great care of us.  They have a great salad bar and a hot bar with homemade sides.  The prices are good and the sunset views are amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent all around! Cooking your own steak is cool, brownie dessert was amazing! Great waitress and owners. View was amazing as well."}
{"text":"Hey it was fun to go here. Decent price for good food. Salad bar was a bit lackluster, but i wasn't there for the salad. Great waitstaff made for a pleasant time. Simple is better sort of place-did it well too. Bread was to die for."}
{"text":"Someone explain to me why it tasks 20 minutes to get raw steak to the table? I don't understand... Besides waiting for over to be able to cook my own food the restaurant needs to be update more, it felt like a cafeteria. Had high hopes for a nice steak house in north Mesa but honestly this was disappointing."}
{"text":"I was skeptical when I found out I'd be cooking my own steak, but O M G!!! Everything was so delicious and it didn't take long for my tri-tip to be well done  (the way I like it). My love got their smoked meat platter and won't stop raving. The veggies were cooked well, still a little crunch and not soggy. The meats were so smokey delicious. And the bread...just like mom used to make, with apple cinnamon butter.   Delicious doesn't even do justice to this place. You've got to give it a try!"}
{"text":"Looks Great! Simple menu. Out of burgers. Appetizers only on dinner menu. Good drink menu. Taxi up and park in front of the restaurant ."}
{"text":"Staff member Justin had a very welcoming personality  and excellent hospitality. Whoever is in charge of staffing at steak and stone is doing a great job! My wife is a very picky with her steaks but she loved her ribeye Justin helped cook for us ! I would highly recommend steak and stone to my friends and family. Awesome experience! Thanks Justin."}
{"text":"Me and my husband came in for dinner a few days ago and Kristi was our server, she was the most polite, helpful server I've had in a long time. She showed us how to properly cook our steaks and suggested some delicious drinks. She definitely made our night a great one!"}
{"text":"Was in AZ for the weekend and was looking for a steak place when I found this place on Yelp!  Arrived close to closing but the staff said it was no problem to come in and order. Very unique cooking on a hot stone at the table but it was really neat and a lot of fun. The sides were awesome! The cuts we were brought were very good quality. If in the area again, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great concept but food overall was ok in taste. Restaurant def does not have the feel for the pricey plates. In need of updates. Good experience for a one time event."}
{"text":"I love the concept they have here, bringing hot stones to place the steak or meat you order to cook. Very ingenious idea that they've executed well.  The only downside to the place is the decor is dated and it does attract a most geriatric crowd. But if you can get past those things you won't be disappointed in the food."}
{"text":"Go to Maestro's/Flemings for Quality experience to be served quality food and treated with respect for the same $$$ as you would spend at Steak & Stone to cook your own food and help your self salad bar....???With filthy dirty floors-filthy chairs, Goodwill silverware, mason chair glasses-under construction, joke of a bar $$$-- $11 for a single shot of house whiskey. Terrible serve yourself salad bar, poor quality meat with no flavor that you have to hack at to cook the flavorless blobs. Charging an additional $2 for \"loaded\" overcooked miniature potato, The unqualified servers-worst experience from a server-ever--- knowing that at least one of our parties steak was sub par -- too thin and overcooked before delivered to the table - looked like a cheap cut of meat from a cafeteria with NO Flavor/ not a $38 ribeye....told the customer \"next time\" you should tell the kitchen to cook it. Save yourself from this mistake of a \"restaurant\"-Sick as I write this from either the food or the smoke that was not filtering out of the building. All of our clothes reak of smoke, our car on short drive home now smells of smoke. We all have headaches and upset stomaches. We had taken clients here to celebrate closing on their new home.  NEVER AGAIN! Last ditch effort from manager was to offer their token joke 10% off \"next time\" visit. There is NO WAY this place will make it through the season with these outrageous price tags for cooking your own food in a filthy setting."}
{"text":"Loved this place. The steak is awesome and the concept is great. Don't wear a nice shirt though..."}
{"text":"Best every, excellent experience.  Tina was our waitress who was a joy to interact with.  Steaks were excellent.  Bring family and friends for great food, great atmosphere, right on Falcon Field Airport."}
{"text":"Just finished and I have to say the experience was Very Cool. The Ribs are definitely Average, but the TRI Tip and house cut steak were a Home Run.  If your coming here I would stick with the Stone cooked meats and not order meats they have prepared....it takes away from the experience.  Service was okay on a Wednesday night with the restaurant about 3/4 full.  I will definitely return.....Great Steaks and Fun atmosphere.  Steaks Steaks Steaks."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Highly recommend it!!! Great food and concept to go along with great pricing as well."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. I guess after an hour and a half of waiting after we ordered everything tastes good. Meat and sides came out 20 min apart. Great place if you have 3 hours for dinner."}
{"text":"We visited a while ago and found the concept of the restaurant to be fantastic but the actual execution to be lacking. It's like the melting pot but for steak! The food was good but our server was forgetful and didn't explain the process of the meal. We had no room on our table to fit plates and felt rushed to eat our steak before it was completely cooked through. The server told us after the meal that we should have asked them to take the stones away once our food was cooked to our liking.  It would have been great to know this information beforehand since it was our first time. We had to ask to get two of our sides that we had ordered that were forgotten and asked multiple times for drink refills."}
{"text":"This review is based on my second time dining at Steak and Stone.  My dinner partners and I were offered the option to be seated indoors or outside and we chose outside as the inside was pretty crowded and smelled strongly of cooking steak (which in small doses can really stimulate ones appetite, but in overwhelming doses is nasty).    Our waitress was very pleasant, taking our order and explaining to one dinner guest how one cooks their steak on a searing hot stone.  But once she orbited by one or twice we found ourselves waiting... for bread.... for bread plates and silverware...for the entrees to arrive...for dinner plates and cutlery... for the bill....    We all also found the salad bar acceptable,  not great, but completely lacking a 'start' and 'finish', resulting in new arrivals having to wedge their way into the circular ring of people working their way around it.    The steaks were of high quality and the prices were acceptable, though not inexpensive.  So overall - a 2 star rating.  The steak quality and price raised this from a 1 star rating.  YMMV."}
{"text":"It's a fun concept but falls short of expectations. Waitstaff was too busy to provide acceptable service. Steak was not as high of quality as I would think and the sides are pitiful. I really wanted to like it."}
{"text":"A wonderful place to grab a steak!  We have been waiting over a year to come to this restaurant and it exceeded all of our expectations.  Tony, our server was awesome.  He knew this was our first time in, but we could easily tell he was always genuine and accommodating.  He took the time to explain the menu, the process, had the manager make a cocktail to our specification (where she took the time to come over after I got my drink to ask how it was and spent a minute talking to us).  Worth an 80 mile round trip, just make sure to save room for the brownie dessert while watching the planes at Falcon Airport from inside the restaurtant."}
{"text":"Stopped in a few days ago for lunch, 1:30 ish. The only vehicle in the front of the restaurant was a commercial pickup. We went in, the salad bar is right in front and since no one was around to greet us, we checked out the salad bar. There was a decent sized bowl of lettuce and some side veggies, 3 covered skillets and containers that might have had soup. Sounded like people in the back but since no one came to greet us we left. $15 for a so so salad bar didn't seem to be worth it. Don't think they can do better than Sweet Tomatoes. Don't know if we'll stop back. One star only because we had to enter something."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. I don't think I fully understood how unique of an experience this was before I got here and saw other orders coming out uncooked and sizzling on a 500° lava stone.   Whether you are a novice steak enthusiast or grill master and connoisseur, the experience of being able to cook each bite to the perfect temperature is something that will keep you coming back. And what is even better is that you can have a hot meal no matter how long you sit and enjoy the rustic atmosphere. Take your steak off the stone before it is cooked all the way and add a strip at a time so that it doesn't get overcooked or cold. I even added my sweet potato fries at the end of the night to reheat on the stone.   Oh yeah, and it was delicious. Our server brought out some bourbon glaze which I recommend.    And, as clumsy as I am, I didn't even burn myself. Our server demonstrated that they were okay to quickly touch you just wouldn't want to leave your hand on it (duh!). I can't wait to come back and bring new people and only wish I lived closer but it is worth the drive."}
{"text":"What can I say but excellent.  I had the ribeye and my wife had a fillet mignon. If you appreciate great beef similar to the Midwest, you are going to have lip smacking enjoyment. Don't even think to ask for some steak sauce to ruin this meat.  It does not need it. It is that good. Slipped my veggies on the rock with the steak and they came out awesome too. I think I'm getting hungry again....."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an interactive dining experience this place makes for a fun evening. The steaks come raw and you can cook to your liking on a 600 degree stone. They have steak prices for all pocketbooks which also includes salad bar or potato. If you have a chance to be seated in Liz's section at the Mesa location you will be completely charmed. She provides delightful service."}
{"text":"Tony was an awesome server & the food was delish! Great salad bar too."}
{"text":"Excellent steak, excellent service. This is our second time around and our only complaint is they change the flat stones to round stones. Rounded stones are much difficult to handle. This was discussed with one of the managers,and we,were told they are fixing this issue."}
{"text":"Ok, this place was awesome. The smell of the cedar slabs mixing with the filet and the volcanic rock was amazing. Never smelled a better tasting steak. Watching the steak cook right in front of you was great. I'm a control freak so i was able to get the steak exactly how i liked it. One of my complaints is that the meat is hot on the first bite and cold on the last bite. Not here, every bite is piping hot! Secondary comments, salad was great, fresh dark greens. The bread needs improvement as well as the brats. The brats were lower than expected. The tri-tip was just as good as the filet. Well worth the visit."}
{"text":"Think Mexican barbecue. First time here, good service and decent food. Quality was not amazing but decent nonetheless. We had the BBQ plate, stone plate sirloin steak and lava bowl. Lava bowl tastes great and very unique. Overall nice place and recommend a visit."}
{"text":"I had business travel in the area.  I had the 12 oz Filet. Awesome!! extremely tender with tons of flavor.  One of the best steaks I've had."}
{"text":"First of all, if you ever visited Anzio's landing which was in this location previously, change your expectations.  It was upscale, but tired, so I wasn't terribly surprised that it had closed.  But don't feel the need to dress up nearly as much at this new steakhouse.  It's significantly cheaper and people wear whatever they feel like wearing, which is fine, just manage your expectations.  So I REALLY like the concept of this place.  I love being able to cook each bite of my steak to exactly how I want it.  The bread is delicious and tastes homemade compared to other restaurant breads like outback, texas roadhouse or the like.  The steaks are seasoned well.  The sides leave a bit to be desired but I'm not coming here for the sides!  The concept is unique and I really hope the business takes off.  But I doubt it will and it's entirely because of the way it's managed.  I hope they can hire in a consultant to help fix these weird issues that have come up.   I've been here several times and noticed some reoccurring issues.    First there is no dedicated host staff to seat you, so especially if it is busy you just hope a staff member (or manager) walking through the lobby will seat you.  Once someone said they would prepare a table, and then while they were preparing it, 2 or 3 more people asked if we had been helped which just sets a disorganized and frankly weird vibe already.  So if one or two people took ownership of seating people it would make all the difference.   Second, I feel like it goes without saying that the tables by the runway are really cool, so they should be constantly full if possible.  I once went towards the end of the day (so it seems improbable they would've have other reservations), and was seated next to the aisle and got to deal with carts rolling by and other traffic, while several tables right by the windows were empty when we were seated and sat open, but dirty, for our entire dinner (the large booth in the corner was extremely dirty which in some weird way affected our dinner).  So maybe a busser to help turn around those prime tables faster? I realize they are sometimes now having a sign that says seat yourself, but that doesn't seem like great management either.  But I just roll with it. Third, sadly most of the staff don't seem especially sharp.  Most of the servers seem timid, but on this most recent visit the server was refreshingly assertive and friendly so that was nice.  The manager/ owner kind of lurks around tables in an uncomfortable way as well but this seems to be lessening as time goes by.  I appreciate a quick check in but the execution is wrong...  Fourth, as mentioned in other reviews, the service is a little slow by normal restaurant standards, but exceptionally slow when you consider your steak is arriving uncooked.  So something needs to be done to expedite this, (although again things seemed faster on this last visit with the assertive, friendly server sorry I can't remember her name!).   These are the glaring issues I've noticed and we've actually imagined Gordon Ramsay coming in and really helping them run the place right and the things he would say in the process!  But really this place would be great (and could charge more) if it was managed right."}
{"text":"Unique idea and novel experience! It was fun to cook your own steak and choose the seasonings. Portions were very filling. Staff were friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Incredible steak served on a hot stone that cooks right in front of you, you cook it to your liking.  Incredible smells permeate the restaurant, makes you salivate right on the spot. Salad bar is amazingly fresh with fresh hot sides too!  Plus the service is awesome.     This is our fourth visit and we plan to continue returning.  The food will not disappoint but you must like meat. Views of Falcon field airport,taxiing airplanes to boot. Psst....Get the Molcajete bowl"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for some steak, I was pleasantly surprised with the large menu selection and great service. The food portions are huge and well worth the money. It's definitely a unique experience and a must try! I always have a problem with restaurants not refilling my water glass, but these ladies were on top of things and my water cup was never empty. I will be back"}
{"text":"Went there for my first time tonight with my grandparents. The service was phenomenal. The food was absolutely delicious. We had Justin as our server, probably the best server I have ever had. Wonderful experience I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone! Ask for Justin!"}
{"text":"Service was slow. We didn't get our drinks for 20 mins and it was same time we got our meat delivered. Waited a long time to get our check too. Server could tell we were frustrated and didn't do anything. Food was just ok, not great. Sweet potatoes seemed like they were from a can. Bread was not good, had weird taste. It's hard to cook your food from the booth seating because you're lower. I was so afraid of burning myself. I may go back for lunch and atmosphere but I'm not running out to tell all my friends to try it."}
{"text":"I'm giving them four stars for the food. Food taste good, but that's all I can say good about this place. First they are out of control and they get up tight if you say something negative, such as it took our waitress 20 minutes to take our order, then ask if we need anything, we said yes would like a refill on drink, well that took 15 mins and our dinner from the time we ordered it finally got to our table it was 90 minutes. They only say sorry we got really busy, well this was the third time we have gone there.overall they don't know how to run a restaurant. Pretty sad. Only go here if you have Three plus hours to waste. If they could get a person who knows how to manage this place nightly and have it run smoothly, they would be a successful place."}
{"text":"A gimmick restaurant for people who don't understand steak. If you want a chef prepared steak, this is not the place for you. If you want to overcook your self-seasoned steak on a rock, this is the place for you. However, go into the experience knowing that you could have bought a steak for a third of the price at a butcher shop and then cooked it yourself at home."}
{"text":"Last night was our first time at the restaurant.  We were greeted by a friendly staff. We went early and were seated pretty quickly.  I would advise going early as they fill up fast. Our waiter was helpful and friendly.  The salad bar was good but nothing exceptional.  I had the sirloin steak and my husband had the filet. Both were great and it was fun to cook your own steak. I like my steak rare & didn't have to cook it long. I also had some ribs and they had a nice smokey flavor. We had a great experience and will be going back. They do take reservations for 6 or more."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff they were very helpful for us first timers. Our son enjoyed the experience of cooking on the stone and the added flavoring made it delicious. My husband had the ribs and they were moist and tasty. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not impressed.      You enter the restaurant in full view of the rear end of the building.   A garbage container and various carboard boxes strewn about.    We arrived for a late lunch (3pm).   The floor was dirty.   The  sneeze gaurds on the salad bar dirty as well.  The chairs and tables are old.   My chair was unstable and in need of repair.  They use mason jars for glasses and mine had an unidentifiable \"goober\" stuck to the inside rim.  My mother's chicken fingers were disgusting, store bought and previously frozen.     I ordered the pulled pork tacos.   No salso, No cilantro, No pico de gallo.    Just 3 limes and cabbage and a bullet of BBQ SAUCE! in what was basically a pulled pork sandwich without the bread (substitute soft tortillas).    The pork was not hot and I did not eat it with confidence.     If I get sick tonight I'll be updating this review.    Our waitress, friendly but with only 2 tables in her station managed to keep us hostage waiting for our check for nearly 10 minutes.  Never once checked back to ask us how our food was or if we needed anything.   I finally had to raise my hand to interrupt her loud obnoxious and lengthy conversation she was having with her other table 5 tables down.   \"Check Please!\".      The steak and stone idea sounds intriguing but we won't be back to find out how that works."}
{"text":"I love this place! The steak is very tender and delicious. It's great being able to make it how you want and great selection of size. The price is fantastic."}
{"text":"A little underwhelmed by this place. The experience of cooking your entree over a hot stone is cool. We each tried a different side to be able to share. But the sides that were ordered with the meat were underseasoned and lacked flavor. Be it the fries, or the mashed potatoes or the mushrooms, they were all not good. The meat was great... but then, that's compliments to us for cooking it just right on the hot stone. It was enough to experience it once. Probably won't come here again."}
{"text":"Concept is very dated.   Salad bar options are poor.   Service was very slow however Bartender was very nice. Menu is limited and bland."}
{"text":"This place sticks to the basics of serving quality meat. I very well enjoyed my 12oz ribeye steak... the lava stone concept is quite unique in the area. Delicious dining in a nice airport-setting!"}
{"text":"Worst experience, walked out last night! After waiting for 10 mins just to be seated and no one at the hostess stand, we were finally seated and 10 mins not even a water or the waiter to come back, we left! Wasn't even that busy! Yelp reviews are deceiving for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Our meal started off with some bad news (out of a couple items) but luckily our server Brady turned the night around for us! She was ultra attentive and made sure we had everything we needed to help us enjoy our first experience at Steak and Stone. My husband highly recommends the tri-tip!"}
{"text":"This a very unique and tasty restaurant. The sides were outstanding. I got the fried pickles and sweet creamed corn. One word: awesome! Great steaks too. I got to cook it myself on the 500 degree stone and it turned out perfect. Friendly staff and relaxed environment. Carolyn was our server and she was very polite and prompt. Try this place out of you already haven't."}
{"text":"Pros: Great cut of meat. Cool concept. Cons: Poor steak seasoning options, inexperienced staff (unable to give recommendations on what to order or how to season the meat), the restaurant has bright lights and no ambiance, salad bar and sides were the quality of a mediocre all you can eat buffet, mostly senior citizen crowd, don't expect anything to be \"made to order\" other than the meat and even that is questionable; definitely overpriced for what we experienced."}
{"text":"My husband loves the steaks and sides.  They have gluten free options and are awesome about modifications"}
{"text":"Our server Grant was a big help in selecting the right steak.   This was a fantastic restaurant to eat at.  Being able to cook your own food is wonderful.  I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant I have ever been too. Every side was cold. I couldn't get a refill on my drinks because the server was busy with other things. If you enjoy cafeteria style bowls and a paper napkin then you will feel right at home. Lastly, the stone was never hot enough to cook my meat. It took forever. I will never go back. There are many other steak houses that would blow this one away."}
{"text":"We loved this place and came here often, even had our wedding rehearsal dinner here! Went last night for the first time in a couple months and we were extremely disappointed with the menu change. Not only did they raise their prices and take off some of the items like the 6oz tri-tip, now a salad isn't even included with your meal?! $10 for a side salad? I understand that price if it's unlimited but when you previously could get a salad and a side with your meal it seems excessive. Still love the food and atmosphere, just a huge bummer about the menu change and price increases."}
{"text":"Grant, our server, was awesome. Very attentive. Food was awesome.  Fun dining, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"House Steak 16oz - amazing. Will definitely coming back! Has another location in Utah that I am excited to visit as well! Boom."}
{"text":"This place is way over priced with decent food that you have to cook yourself. The service and scenery is good."}
{"text":"Really let down. I was expecting so much more. The rib eye was awful. Almost all grizzle and fat. The seasonings were below average in taste, uniqueness and imagination. The house wine was exactly that, a weak offering. Overall, $157.00 for an ok salad bar. Much better value all over Mesa."}
{"text":"Do NOT waste your money. Just spent 70.00 for 2 people for a Steak I could have gotten at Walmart and a salad bar?!?!?  1 trip too don't you dare eat more salad because your still hungry. I can't remember a time I left a restaurant feeling like I was just robbed. They have food that is all premade, nothing actually cooked in their kitchen. We thought this would be more like a Melting Pot type experience. Turned out to be a cafeteria with a hot rock on your table and some salad from a bag. I could have just gone to the Keg and actually gotten the food and quality I was paying for."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this new Mesa restaurant- my kids specifically asked to eat there in celebration of both of their straight A's. We made reservations for 730 on a Friday night and arrived at the specified time but waited about 10 minutes for the table to open up- it was busy.  After being seated we were greeted fairly quick for our drink orders, and the drinks came out in customary time. (We were told bread would soon come but it didn't arrive until about 30 mins after sitting.) Our appetizers came in 15 mins and we ordered main dishes after. After ordering we didn't get much in the way of drink refills for quite some time as we waited for our food. And we waited. And we waited. And then we waited some more. At about 10 mins after 9 pm we were told that half my sons order would be unavailable - they were \"out of it.\" Lol- ok. We ordered something different. At about 915 our food finally came. I don't say his often: It was WORTH the wait. I had their prime rib which was smoked for about 6-7 hours and had an incredible flavor to it. Best I have ever had, which is saying something because I've had a lot of prime rib. My wife ordered the Molcajete Lava Bowl- basically a fajita dish served in a hot Indian stone bowl- outstanding. My boys had the chicken served on hot stones. Easily some of the most moist and tender and flavorful chicken we've had. They had a blast cooking it themselves.  We topped it all off with their single serving chocolate cake, cheese cake, and coconut cream pie cup. Cheese cake was subpar but the other 2 were very good- coconut cream pie was the best overall. We got out of there at 10 pm, literally. It was a 2.5 hour meal- waaaay too long. (Good thing the food was awesome right??)  Bottom line: You better try this restaurant out quickly because they won't be in business long if everyone has to wait that long for food. I do hope they figure it out because they know what they're doing in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place since they opened. Great customer service. This restaurant is getting better every time. I have brought people from out of town, and all of my family. Not once have I had a bad experience. Love the new hot bar and salad bars. Owner is always coming around and checking in, awesome date night also."}
{"text":"This place is an interesting take on a steak house. It was really fun to be able to cook my own steak to perfection. The sauce they give you was great! It adds a little bit of an extra zing. The sides we got were the garlic mashed potatoes and the creamed corn both were great! The steaks were seasoned perfectly and an overall good experience on the food, the only reason it's getting a 4 star is because there were 3 other tables with people during lunch and it took about 10 minutes minutes longer than expected to get our food after we ordered. I don't know it just seemed like a long time to bring us a raw piece of meat and some sides"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try Steak & Stone Out for the evening. It was a good experience but there is something you should be aware of. They serve your meat raw on a very hot stone. You are expected to season and cook your own meat to your liking. The meat quality and cut are excellent however at the prices they are asking, I expect them to cook it. I read reviews about the cheese platter and cream corn side dish and decided to try them. It was good but nothing to rave about. I don't think we would do the meat and cheese platter again. We would possibly come back and try their other choices. Their WiFi was a little confusing to connect to as well. The reason is the had a Steak & Stone WiFi, a Steak & Stone Guest Wifi and a Steak & Stone free guest WiFi which non of those gets you to their WiFi. You have to connect to the Yelp Wifi to connect. Should be clear as mud. The ambience was modern rustic and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the service was great. We came for our friends birthday and we had a great time, there was always a server around us taking care of everything we needed and when the food was served there were like 5 servers to make sure that the food was in everybody's plate, will totally come back."}
{"text":"Fun unique experience! No room to complain how your steak is prepared since you cook them yourself.   Servers were very efficient, polite and friendly. Karlie was fantastic  Would recommend not sitting at a round table as the food, stones and sides take up a lot of space and makes it more difficult to reach and move things around."}
{"text":"Ok I've been going to steak n stone since they opened. Loved the concept loved the food and loved the price. Each time we come back they change the menu, meat cuts and price. Kinda disappointing but for the price the experience it can't be beat. We will continue to visit but wish it was the original way. Also they are connected to a brewery which is really nice!!   All in all a cool experience and our family loves coming!!"}
{"text":"From the minute you walk in the door and smell the wonderful aroma, and hear all the happy customers you know you're in the right place. Cooking the steak on the stone was a novel idea enjoyed it very much. And after all if you overcook it it's your fault not the chefs."}
{"text":"This is a unique way to have dinner. The service was bad. After waiting over an hour (because our order was lost) we had to ask for 2 new stones to cook our meat. The manager did come over and apologize. She also made it right. Would I go again No.  It's pretty much self serve. For the price it's just not that great. We may have hit it on a bad day. But, it was in the middle of the week and they weren't that busy. So, if you go just be ready to wait."}
{"text":"Loved the concept but the customer service was the best I have had anywhere in a long time!"}
{"text":"Fun dining experience.  Went for lunch with A Groupon that I purchased. Will definitely return with friends!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience from the time we talked to the front lady to our food and waiter Tony We did use a Groupon but I will tell you the price was even wonderful without that. The steak was fun to cook and the taste was so yummy and melted  in my mouth. The lunch also included a salad bar that had wonderful selection and a pick of one side. We topped lunch of with a brownie and though we had a little trouble walking out it was so worth the pain.. will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"OMG!! Just had a great dinner and experience at Steak and Stone. We have never heard of a place that cooks the steak on a stone at the table. It was awesome. Our waitress, Hilary was awesome. Very nice and friendly. The  entire experience was great. Thanks to everyone."}
{"text":"We just had the most fabulous experience!! Sat 12 people on a Saturday night and got in and out in 1 1/2 hours after having the best steak and the best service. Our server was JUNE and she was fabulous!!!! Steak was amazing and the kids loved cooking it!! Young to old this place will be on our repeat list"}
{"text":"Let me just say how fun and exciting plus delicious.  You get to cook your own steak on a heated stone.  You get to season it yourself.  The buffet bar is delicious as well.  I have going on Sundays after Church with family.  We really enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Went here with a large group so minus one star for the crazy long wait time for parties over 6 on a Thursday night. That being said, food was awesome, service was great once we were seated and the bread pudding was phenomenal. Bartender was super friendly and held out bottle of wine until we got seated. Steak was excellent and ribs were fall off the bone. Bread was great and apple butter was super good. Would go back again if in town but just be prepared for a long wait with a party over 6 people.  Kids menu was great and even our picky eaters were happy."}
{"text":"A great experience that I wish I could give more than 5 stars!!! The food was awesome & our server (Tina) was beyond amazing & totally made the experience a blast!!! She has a wonderful singing voice so if you have a birthday - I recommend you enjoy a dinner at this restaurant. My picture is what I took half way through the meal, however you are able to cook the meat to your liking!!"}
{"text":"You have a steak and a stone and you cook your steak on the stone. Any questions. Yes it was good cause I cooked it to the perfect med rotate."}
{"text":"I've eaten good meat before from D.C. throughout the Southeast. With that said, after eating my filet tonight at Steak & Stone, I can honestly state no other steak in the past has come anywhere close! The entire dining experience from the very friendly and knowledgeable waitstaff/owners/staff to the attractive decor to the sublime meal was perfect in every way. I highly recommend this restaurant to locals and visitors alike. Believe me, the price fades into insignificance when coupled with one of the best meals one would ever enjoy!"}
{"text":"Heard about the Steak and Stone from a friend. Tried it and was impressed.  Very friendly staff, great service and a really good steak!  Really loved the novelty of cooking at the table on a hot stone.  A fun and fulfilling evening.  Went back to Steak and Stone again and was sorely disappointed.  We were seated promptly but it took 20 minutes to get someone to the table to order drinks.  Then when we tried to order, they were Out of almost everything.  Service was horrible.  Kept apologising and saying they were busy!!  NOT MY PROBLEM!!  Also prices increased over 50% over our last visit and service wad 100% worse.  Will probably not return."}
{"text":"Our first time at Steak in a Stone and we were unsure about the idea of cooking steaks on a literal stone but wow were we in for a treat.   We ordered the sirloins and were surprised by how easy and simple they make it here they provide good tasting seasonings and explain what to do and you are off to the races metaphorically speaking.  The steaks were insanely juicy and cooked to perfection at a nice medium. The seasonings were great and truly brought out the steaks potential. I want to say that the stone adds something to the steak because these really tasted unlike other steaks.   These guys blow out the competition !   P.S. Make sure to get your table with Stephanie, she's awesome and brings personality to your dining experience!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed being a part of opening week here! Figuring out their kinks very quickly, was very pleased with what a great new restaurant this is! Our waitress's service was impeccable! Kind, attentive, and patient--I'll come back based on service! Fun sides add a delight to a protein filled menu. The sauce will keep you coming back. Great to have steak and stone for a night out."}
{"text":"Steak N Stone is simply the best!! Steak is phenomenal and service is by far the best . Mike was our server and extremely attentive and friendly. Let's not forget Nora and Brady- these two lady's always remember our name and our orders. Mike, Nora and Brady are money in the bank!!!This place feels like home with a loving family. Thank you for the great experience!"}
{"text":"Good steak but the \"sides\" bar is really cruddy and buffet like. Don't want to pay $30 bucks for a steak and have to go get sides from a buffet line! Steak was excellent but if they improve the sides this could be a high snd establishment."}
{"text":"Best steak in town. And you can cook it just the way YOU LIKE IT!!  Sides were great as well!!  Finally Mesa has a great place to eat out!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! We had a wonderfully flavorful family meal and they helped my 10 year old cook his steak. The ribs fell off the bone and it was a true half-rack. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came across this hidden gem while out driving. Surprised by husband with a date night dinner here last Friday night.  We loved it.  We sat by the window, loved seeing the small planes flying in and out. We hot the lava bowl thing as an appetizer... Soo yummy!! My husband ordered the tri tip and loved it.  I got the sirloin and loved it. They bring the raw meat out on a 500+ degree stone, you heat/cook to your liking right in front of you!!!! Their beef is one level below prime. Very tender. The bread is delicious too. Fun, unique Restaurant!! Must try!! We will be back. Great place to take visitors to! Excited to go back soon."}
{"text":"Such a great environment at SUCH a great price!! The owner came by the table twice to check on us, and the waiters & waitresses were so friendly and involved. The food was incredible, and we watched the sunset as planes landed next to us. I cannot wait to come back. It's the perfect place for anyone-families, dates, or birthdays."}
{"text":"In the mood for Steak & Stone, try Gilbert location They have the experienced staff. 3rd disappointment at Mesa. \"a place is only as good as its staff\", they can make it or break it. Not fair for staff or customers. Employees don't know what they don't know! Please add some training to your schedules."}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me here for my bday, first time for both, great service by both Brady and Mike the bartender.   Mike created amazing drinks at the bar, you have to take advantage of the happy hour!   Brady was attentive and made sure we were satisfied with the way our steaks turned out.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"This was my wife and I, first visit to this establishment and we decide to go during the lunch.  I wish I could remember the gentleman's name who waited on us and seated us in the booth, he was very upstanding to our first visit and very professional.  My wife chose the salad bar and the soup bar I ordered the thin sliced prime rib sandwich and the soup bar. We both had multiple bowls of the fantastic potato soup also tried the rice soup and the chili. We were told that all the soups were made in house from scratch. The statement had to be true because I've never had such a fantastic bowl of potato soup and being from the upper Midwest we know our potato soups.   My sandwich was fantastic and my wife made two trips to the salad bar also multiple bowls of soup.  Do yourself a favor and go to this place before the snowbirds get back in town."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with steak and stone after our last visit. First of all, when we walked in we stood by the hostess table for about 15 minutes before we decided to walk into the bar and ask for some help. When we walked in there all the employees were in there talking. One noticed that we were trying to get their attention and just kept talking. We finally got some help after a few minutes of waiting for their conversation to be over. After we were seated I noticed that they changed their menu and pricing since we went the first time. They increased prices by at least 30%. That made me a little upset because we went again expecting the same price range. The waitress was very rude and seemed inconvenienced anytime we needed something. We ordered two appetizers, mozzarella sticks and fried zucchini. I thought both were very good but the mozzarella sticks were served with ranch not marinara. For dinner I ordered a 6 oz steak, potatoes and a side salad. The salad was decent. The steak was tiny definitely not 6 oz and the potatoes tasted old, almost like they have been sitting in the kitchen all day. My mother in law order the peach cobbler for dessert and was very disappointed. It was not cobbler.. It was yellow cake with peaches underneath it. I don't think my husband and I will be visiting Steak and Stone again!"}
{"text":"Great experience! Awesome staff, Anissa was our server and she was on top of it all! Great food as well!"}
{"text":"Our party of 10 came in for dinner last week for my birthday. Several of us arrived at  7:30 and sat in the bar (by the hostess), who was also the bartender, until the rest of our party arrived. We were then taken to our table by the hostess/bartender, who then became our waitress.  This restaurant concept is fabulous, BUT THE DETAILS NEED TO BE SERIOUSLY REFINED, or you'll be out of business in 6 -12 months. We ordered a sirloin, several 6oz & 12oz filets, a ribeye, a porterhouse and a sirloin and shrimp. The steaks were incredible! The cuts were so tender. The process & presentation of the steaks coming out on the hot stones, was really fun. The cooking of the steaks was fun, and much less \"work\" than I thought it would be. One person in our party didn't even want to cook her own steak because she thought she would ruin it. but she even enjoyed it. The salad bar is HOKEY! Get RID of the \"salad bar.\" The salad comes FREE with the steaks, but only TWO out of TEN in our group opted for FREE salad.That salad bar concept is so unappetizing. I tried the salad bar, It was totally cheesy, 1980's sizzler style, BUT the cucumber, onion and tomato salad was good.  TIP #1; REMOVE salad bars, replace with 4/5 vintage, leather chairs in a circle, center with a large coffee table, have it anchored with a fabulous chandelier, &serve cocktails, &appetizers while guests are waiting on a table. This place COULD be all the RAGE!  Going back to the salad bar; It was be so much classier to have simple, prepared salads, chilled in a kitchen fridge, presented to guests after their order is placed. It takes the service up a notch and doesn't turn guests off. I read a response from the owner, in another review, where he states; \"They don't  want to be known as an upscale steak house\".  \"WTH!\" You have an amazing, authentic concept, you have a gold mine at your fingertips! As a self -dubbed \"professional eater\" who eats out 5 nights a week, almost everyday for lunch, with an occasional Sunday Brunch, mostly all in Scottsdale or other areas where they have great restaurants,  I am telling you, you are TOTALLY missing the mark on your vision and concept.    The devil is in the details. It's almost like there is a bi-polar, DIY crafter, entrepreneur taking a swing at owning a restaurant. You have this amazing Concept, yet you serve condiments in plastic, IN and OUT ketchup cups. You give cheap, picnic rolled napkins with a $40 steak. At dinner you should use black linen napkins. If You want me to spend my money in your restaurant, you have to spend money to get me there.  Get rid of the nasty yams in syrup & unappetizing petrified baked potatoes. Go to CHARLESTONS, on Stapley (In Mesa) order a loaded baked potato, you'll see what the PERFECT baked potato looks like. (I do not work for Charlestons)  but they are the epitome of quality, style and consistency, that your brand is lacking.  Also, we were charged an EXTRA $8 for the butter for our petrified baked potatoes. RIDICULOUS!  DIM THE LIGHTS. AMBIENCE AMBIENCE AMBIENCE! LIGHTING is imperative to every aspect of the dining experience. Play music, or louder music. We walked in, it was SO QUIET, we felt like we had to whisper so we wouldn't make a scene.There were a handful of tables in the restaurant, all middle-age, professionals, and everyone was trying to be quiet as to not be overheard. Your guests should never feel on display or be self conscious about having conversations, and no one likes sitting under bright can lights. Also, if you are going to have battery operated candles, displayed in DIY mason jars lining your walls, YOU NEED TO HAVE THEM LIT . If they are not lit, Why have them? It  makes me think either somebody didn't care enough to light them, too lazy to light them, or forgot to light them, whatever the reason, it shows a lack of excitement & preparation on the part of the owner, management & employees.  Scale back the festive,seasonal decor. This is not Crackers pancake house. That large obtrusive cooler by the entrance, that you unplug for dinner service, If you use it for lunch pick up during your lunch service, then figure out another way to use it at night.Have choice cuts of meat displayed in there, or have your simple lunch options on display at night, so people know you are excited about your lunch service. OR roll it out of the way so dinner guests don't feel like you don't care about the details.Have a designated hostess. Hang heavy, rich, stationary drapes flanking the windows for warmth and richness. There's so many lacking details, but I have no more space to write. I want you to do well. But no one who appreciates eating out of paper condiment holders, is going to pay $40 for a steak with petrified potato, while seated in a brightly lit, library, more than once. :("}
{"text":"The food was good and our steaks were quite good.  It was loads of fun seasoning and then searing each bite. However,  it would be better if shrimp came out off the stone so my daughter could season it before it became over done.  The service was not good.  We didn't have anyone take our order for a long time. Drink orders didn't come.  We didn't get enough plates  (only 5 of us) waters weren't filled.  It just seems some training would be a benefit"}
{"text":"Absolutely an amazing experience not only the food but the service was excellent. Our server Nolan was outgoing and on top of it.  Thank you for the wonderful experience and will definitely be back. Jennifer"}
{"text":"Steak and Stone is my go-to Steak place. Their customer service is as amazing as their food."}
{"text":"Best pulled pork I've ever had. My friend got a steak and he loved it. Will definitely be back. Bartender was also great. Overall it's an awesome  restaurant. They have chicken options as well if you're not into red meat. 5/5."}
{"text":"Neat concept and totally different from anywhere else I've been. They have options of Steak to chicken, to even fish that you can cook on the stone. They also had other options if cooking on the stone isn't that important too ya.  You could also add a salad bar, to your meal, for $7 more.    The main problem that we had was the stone cooled down too quickly so we had to wait for a couple more stones to be available, too finish cooking our steaks. Also, our steaks didn't have much taste but they did offer seasonings on the side, that you could add to your steaks. Nothing big    It was a fun experience trying it out but not sure if it would be one of our regular places to go. I do recommend at least trying it out. It is a little pricey for what you get  but it's a cool concept."}
{"text":"Excellent service the cook did a great job. Would recommend to friends! Say hi to Karlie for us!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  Great food absolutely the best customer service possible.  They will treat you like family. The manager Nolan will take care of you and treat you with respect. He represents Steak and Stone with his heart and soul !"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came here for Valentine's Day. It was our first time here and I must say I was very disappointed with the service.   My fiancé called on Monday (two days before Valentine's Day) to find out if they do reservations on Valentine's Day for 8:30pm. He was told that he can call 45 mins ahead of time to place our name on the list. So he did just that... he called around 7:30pm to put our name on the list and the lady over the phone said that they can only take names 15 mins before arrival. My fiancé explained to her that, that's not what he was told and told him to call at 8pm. He called at 8pm and was put on hold for almost FIFTEEN MINUTES!!!!!   We arrived around 8:30 and we still had to wait about 10-15 mins for our table. Fast forward, we got ordered our meal and our waitress forgot our drink!! I had one Tri Tip steak left and I gave it to my fiancé, the waitress was very nice enough to offer a new stone so the steak could cook faster, which was really nice of her.   As for the food, it wasn't bad! The prices are pretty reasonable. I love the concept of cooking your steak just they way you like it!   All in all, for a busy day like Valentine's Day, they should have been more prepared and organized.. The food wasn't bad, but the service made our first experience here not worth it. Maybe I'll give this place another shot."}
{"text":"Steak and stone is s gray experience with great ambiance! Please don't paint over any of the planes. History is here."}
{"text":"The idea of this place is kind of fun. I am just not a fan of paying a lot of money to cook and season my own food. Service was good and if you out for something different I would deffenitly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous dinner. Ribeye was tender and salad bar well stocked. Excellent magareta."}
{"text":"Came into this location for lunch with three others in my party. The restaurant was quiet, had two tables of 6 seated and eating. There was no hostess and we waited approximately 5 minutes for service. Our waitress, Brady, was very knowledgeable and helpful in explaining the menu (which was a bit more complicated than at face value). I chose to do the \"Steak and Stone Hot Lunch Bar\", others in our party selected the \"Sirloin Steak on Stone\" and the \"Smoked Tri Tip on Stone\". All of us enjoyed our food, but the stand out item was definitely the creamed corn. The novelty of cooking your own food on a hot stone is worth the trip, but I can grill a better steak at home.   While our service was adequate, it was clear that prompt attention to patrons is not a priority for the staff. Throughout our time, another party walked in and back out again after receiving no service. Brady seemed to be running the entire front of the house on her own with extremely limited assistance from other staff members who made an appearance, but offered little or no help to her at all.  The food would rate a 4. The service, sadly, a 1 (and only because Brady was an angel). Definitely room for improvement, but this place has excellent potential."}
{"text":"Fun eating atmosphere in the shadow of Red Mountain. Had deliciously smoky Tri Tip steak seared to taste on a stone. Great food, good service. Can't wait to come again!"}
{"text":"We went Thursday night for the first time and I was very pleased, we ordered our food at five twenty and everyone was served by five forty. There were no mistakes in the orders and all the food was great. I had the steak and shrimp which was superb the steak being very tasty and tender and the shrimp was seasoned to perfection. If you have never been there it is a unique experience and one of the best steak houses in the area."}
{"text":"So good! Pricier than some other places. BUT IT IS WORTH IT!!! I love my red meats, and before I came here, I had never even heard of cooking up a steak this way. I gotta frights our how to do this at home LOL until then, I will be back as often as possible. Also, I'm definitely bringing my family and friends along."}
{"text":"A fun and different restaurant experience! It was really cool to cook our steaks on the large and extremely hot stones, but you leave completely smelling like meat and smoke! Probably not a good lunch stop in the middle of a work day."}
{"text":"Outstanding first experience, delicious food I got the ribeye 16 ounce steak on a rock huge meal really worth it absolutely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Had friends coming from out of town, they saw Facebook pictures of us eating here at Stake and Stone and wanted to try. They haven't stopped singing the accolades of the restaurant. What a fun place great great wait staff, and awesome food."}
{"text":"I haven't been this motivated to post a Yelp review in quite a while, frankly.   Planning an all-too-rare opportunity to spend time with a good friend from out of town, I searched for an establishment which wouldn't be a chain eatery (I possess no tremendous bias against such), but would instead provide a unique and local atmosphere for my guest.   Given that rather unusual criteria, I was willing and prepared to compromise on quality.    Instead, despite being somewhat prepared by the overwhelmingly glowing Yelp reviews, my expectations were greatly exceeded.   Food:  I love steak and am pretty picky.  The grade of the meat (filet mignon) was outstanding; and despite my lack of experience with cooking a steak on stone (watch out, though, if I can grill it) the final product was as good as if the expert chef had done it.  The pricing is reasonable.  I think you actually get what you pay for here.   Service:  Top notch. (Disclaimer: I apologize in advance for any spelling errors as I recall your names).  Servers Anissa (trainer) and Jenna (trainee) were psychic--they anticipated our needs (water, steak sauce, etc.) before we even asked.  Juliet not only delivered the steaks, but patiently explained the cooking process for us (far more pleasantly and just as expertly than/as Gordon Ramsey).  Kudos to that team, and manager Levon.  Mismanaged employees cannot provide excellent customer service, and he understands that to the benefit of staff and customers alike.   Just west of Higley and highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food is good! Service, minimal at best. They should step it up a notch or three. Practically finished my steak medallions before someone came back over and I needed to remind them about the baked potato I had ordered."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre,  service wasn't fantastic. All the hype around the experience was not help up.  I went once to see what all the hype was about and haven't been back since. The buffet atmosphere vs steak house atmosphere is lacking."}
{"text":"First time here with our family. Our food was delicious and flavorful. The service was awesome and fast! Shrimp cocktail and steak was fantastic!"}
{"text":"This was a fun modern take on a \"fondue\" experience! Our server Anissa was very good. You get to cook your steak on a 500 degree lava rock. Recommendation from a steak couple, salt and pepper and butter from the \"hot bar\". Don't use the seasoning on the beef. It is better for chicken. It is a really fun night and you aren't pressured to get out of your table quickly."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the customer service I received from Brittany! I called to make a reservation and she was so friendly, helpful and a joy to speak with! It is so refreshing to speak to someone who cares! I will update this review after I've tried their lunch! Thanks Brittany! Your boss should know u are an asset to the place!"}
{"text":"Just looked at the AA Advantage Dining site and your menu still has salad bar included with the cost of an entree.  Since this is a touchy point with many people  please update your info.  I do see that many people are amazed at your prices and what  is not included.  We averaged every 3 weeks with 6 to 8 people average check size was around 250 to 275   since Dec 2017 have not returned  and will not"}
{"text":"So...Steak & Stone just recently opened in Gilbert, Arizona. It's a pretty interesting concept. You choose your meats and they bring out a 600 degree stone l, and you actually cook your meat right at the table. So when you're eating, it's hot off the stone, and doesn't get any more fresh. The salad bar was incredibly good... very fresh. Then,  there's a hot bar with mac & cheese, baked potatoes, mashed potatoes, and vegetables with all the toppings you can imagine. That was fantastic as well...so all in all, it was great! The service was really great, and the food was incredible. Going back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend had a terrific birthday lunch today.   The smoke pork loin was so juicy and melted in our mouths.  We shared our 2 choices of meat to inculude the beef tips.  They were both so delicious along with the garlic mushrooms that were just perfect.  The added salad bar just makes this restaurant the best.  Can't think of any other restaurant that lets you cook your meat to perfection."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! I will never grill a steak again! Hot stone all the way! I was reserved on having to cook my own meal for my anniversary but the Hubs wanted to try something different. Worth it!! Pros -Prime Filet -Excellent Service - Explained how to cook and wasn't rushed  - Good wine selection and price  - Yummy desert menu  Why I didn't give  5 stars ? Honestly bring me a salad. I felt like I was at the sizzler . I'm not kidding it was soooo sooo good but I hate salad bars, also it's not all you can eat so why? Probably because the servers are busy bringing steaks but then make salad an options. BTW to be fair the website does say salad bar, I guess I did not realize what an impact one little item could matter. Also maybe a napkin service and not cheap napkins.  Did I mention why they earned 4 stars because the food is really that fantastic! We will be back, just not for an anniversary."}
{"text":"Got the filet mignon it was amazing! Creamed corn, potatoes skins, and the molcajete lava bowl was so good! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Visited last night with 2 other couples. Service and servers were outstanding. One of out guests has a health problem, and the server helped him cook the steak and cut it for him. I did discus the saltiness of our steaks with the owner, and he states he take care of the problem. overall a great place for dinner"}
{"text":"Very cool concept. I saw the pics online and had to go experience it for myself. They literally bring out the raw meat and you cook it on a stone right in front of you. Most meals come with a side and salad bar that you get to get up and get yourself. We had a issue with our piece of meat and how it cooked but they were very kind to bring out another piece of meat and assist us in cutting and cooking it correctly! I really appreciated their efforts to fix the situation and make us happy guests. I was able to see a beautiful sunset from my table. The restaurant is very family oriented. I'll definitely be back to show my friends & fam this cool experience!"}
{"text":"Amazing dinner.  Great service and a unique dining experience. The Ribeye came out on a hot lava rock. I got to eat each bite like it was just coming off the pan. Coming back for sure! Loved it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it! Cooking the steak yourself is such an awesome fun concept. The staff was so polite and helpful with everything. They make sure you know what you're doing so you don't over cook anything. Our server was so sweet and friendly. I had the surf and turf and it was absolutely delicious. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"We had a superb lunch. Fun way to grill your dinner yourself and the waitress was great. Great place. Going back for dinner soon!"}
{"text":"This place was meh...honestly I expected more. The atmosphere was blah...the server was nice enough answered any questions I had but was not always good at explaining... I used the check in offer and the app of smoked meat and cheese was ok. The cheese was the best part. The steak on a stone is a readily cool concept but for those of us who know how to cook a steak properly this id's rough... my steak would have been a perfect medium however the center was raw so I cut it up and put it back on which then bc it's smaller pieces over cooked.  I would rather someone cook my steak for me.  My husband pointed out the meat quality was not super great either specially on the appetizer.  Most steak houses you can get 2 sides and all on items...this place you could do salad bar which was the best part of the visit as everything was fresh and crisp OR you could do a side...However!!! You CANNOT get a baked potato at lunch time!! Baked potato is my fave part of steakhouse! So, over all 2 stars for the niceness of the server regardless of the laxidazily explained concept...and bc of the salad bar..."}
{"text":"Great place for any special occasion. So much fun to cook your own steak just the way you like it. We went with a group and had so much fun."}
{"text":"Boy where do I start.... first time here and unfortunately my experience left me yearning for so much more.   My review is solely based on personal preference and by experience at Steak and Stone last night.  It came recommended by some friends and yelp did have it at four stars so I decided to give it a try.   First let me preface this by saying that I was there with a party of 8. We were celebrating two birthdays and Father's Day for my Dad and myself. All very special occasions that we did not get to fully enjoy.   I tried to make reservations elsewhere but a lot of places were booked. Capital grille had availability but we thought why spend so much more when we can maybe find a place for a bit cheaper. At this point I wish I would have stuck with capital grille.   First thing I noticed was that the decor was ok and felt more like a Outback Steakhouse. The tables were giant. And because of that it did not feel cozy. They had live music and the music was so loud that we literally could not hear each other and were yelling across this giant table. Even our waitress was not able to hear us and vice versa. If I could make any suggestion about the live loud music it would be to stop. This is not whiskey row.   Second the place was not that busy and when we ordered the drinks the waitress forgot about them. Half an hour went by and still no drinks or waitress. I finally got fed up and went to the bar myself and got the drinks within 5 minutes.    On to the food. I got the New York Strip and honestly was the worst piece of meat I have eaten. I am not exaggerating this because the week prior I had the same cut from firebirds steakhouse and wow what a difference. This cut had so much fat and cartridge on it that I could not even cut through it with the knife that was provided to me. Half way through I gave up on trying and did not finish the steak. For $37 dollars I expected way more.   I will not go on to describe what everyone else had because it is much of the same. But I will say no one left satisfied.    When I thought about writing a review for steak and stone I certainly did not think it would be this. I hope that this place turns it around if it plans to remain in business."}
{"text":"Love the concept but the execution was terribly lacking.  First, the inside of the restaurant has a major ventilation problem.  There was a white cloud hanging over the entire space and by the time our dinner was done all 4 of us were chocking on the smoke.  Next, the hot lava rock while cooking my steak was right in front of me with my small plate off to the side and there was no room for me to move anything.  Larger tables with room to move the cooking off to the side would be highly desirable.  Finally, the steak.  I don't mind paying $28 for a 12 oz. Ribeye, but they have to go long and thin with the steak to make sure it cooks.  This gives you little skinny pieces of meat rather than a nice piece of steak.  Baked potato was underdone.  The Bourbon Beans - MAGNIFICENT. House salad dressing was quite tasty but again presentation in bowls used to serve was under impressive.  Small loaf of bread for 4 people.  Bring out 2 instead.  Our waiter was a very nice guy and did his best.  Bottom line, won't be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent concept and filet mignon was so amazing! Great restaurant and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So I've been here before and the food is definitely good and I really did like them until today. Today is Valentine's day and I know things get busy, so I had called earlier this week to make a reservation. I was told that they don't do reservations, but the wait should only be around 20 minutes when we come on Valentine's day. So we get here and we're told that the wait is 2 hours and that we needed to call ahead to put our name down. This place is very poorly run and they've definitely lost my business."}
{"text":"We love this place!  The food is delicious!  The service is outstanding! Come hungry!  A lot of food!  Our server was Kristie and was awesome!!! She brought us a BIG piece of Peach Cobbler!  And the experience.....cook your own steak!"}
{"text":"I will definitely be going back. The service was impeccable and the food was to die for!  There would be no excuse of how the steak was prepared because it was cooking right in front of me."}
{"text":"The portion sizes are huge and the concept is so cool! Everywhere in the restaurant there's sizzling stones with cooking meat. The flavor of the ribs was perfect and the molcajete was extremely flavorful and an interesting Mexican meal I've never had before. I'd say the vibe of the restaurant is trendy country with a full bar on one side."}
{"text":"What a fun evening to cook steak on stones.  The manager came and sat at the table with our party of six to ask us for comments.  Good food and good management.  Go you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food Contamination is the reason we won't be back. We went in for lunch after many months of flyers at our home right up the hill in N. Mesa.  We watched a very righteous person wander the dining room on his phone. Help himself to the salad bar. Lick his fingers, get more food, while standing there. The kicker was when he scooped something from a previous patron up off the food line, with bare licked fingers and threw it back in the food on the line. I called later, and the manager on the phone said it was 'one of the owners'.  The person didn't appear to behave like an owner of a food establishment. But that was all we needed to hear. Good smokey ribs but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Myself and a friend dined here on a busy Saturday night!  I love the concept etc, and will most definitely come back! The star deduction is for the mediocre waiter we had who doesn't seem to like his job all that much, and the Toughness of the Tri-Tip I ordered.  The Molcajete Bowl is interesting and I thought it was pretty good.  Sally bar is pretty basic and boring!  I do believe I would come back and splurge and do the 16oz Filet Mignon or try the smoked prime rib on the weekend!  The Smokey Flavor of the Tri Tip was good, but the extreme toughness will definitely make me steer clear of it a future return!  Curious to try a dessert there as well.  Love the concept and wish them nothing but greatness!"}
{"text":"Wow! I stopped in here for the first time last night and was super impressed. I am a big fan of their 8 oz steak and potatoes as well as all the appetizers we ordered. However, the key to me coming back to this restaurant was our waitress, Kim. Kim was super nice and very outgoing! She was very knowledgeable about the restaurant but also seemed well traveled. We honestly wanted her to stop working and just come hang out with us at the table!   Customer service is crucial and Kim has it fo"}
{"text":"I read the previous reviews before coming and agree with all the negative comments. While it is an interesting concept, the wait staff needs help. We arrived at 5 pm and there were about 6 tables taken up but only 1 waitress, and people started piling in. Another waiter and waitress came in around 530 but by then they were already backed up. My husband's drink was never refilled and our used plates were never taken from our table. It's a good thing we did arrive early, because by the time our meal was finished, the whole restaurant was filled with smoke it was unbearable, I could not wait to get out of there. My husband did say his steak was good, and I had the lava bowl which was fair, though pieces of the steak were pure fat and no meat. My husband also couldn't get over how dirty and stained the carpet was considering this place just opened--they should have been replaced. We expected more, and don't think we will be returning."}
{"text":"If you like spicy you must try the bowl here! So so good! Fun atmosphere being at the airport and watching the planes take off plus the view when the sun sets is amazing. The filet is my favorite and I love that every bite is hot off of the stone."}
{"text":"This is my favorite steak place. My new favorite is the tenderloin medalians. Every bite of steak off the stone is hot. Their steaks are tendor and have great flavor. They also have smoked meat. My wife had the smoked ribs and loved them.  Grant was our waiter, he did a great job and was very friendly, he also made a great Elder Beer drink for my wife (gin and ginger beer based drink)"}
{"text":"Beautiful view of Red Mountain and panoramic view of falcon field. You can see a steady stream of planes departing and landing.  The food is sizzling and tasty. In particular, cooking meats on the stone is a fun twist and you can cook the meat exactly to your liking.   Atmosphere is nice and cozy with a warm country tone to it. Plenty of seats for large parties."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! The food is delicious, service is good, and the salad bar is a great option"}
{"text":"This was a really fun experience! How can you go wrong with cooking your own steak an a 500 degrees stone while drinking a glass of nice wine?! They have a great salad bar with lots of hot dish options if you don't want the standard baked potato or veggies.  We will definitely be back to do this again with friends."}
{"text":"We loved the steak and the experience of cooking it on a stone! The only problem we had was with some of the staff. While waiting at the bar for our table, 2 waitresses were standing at the bar waiting for their drinks for their tables and I heard them talking badly about their customers. They had poor attitudes and it was obvious that they didn't want to be there. I don't think any employee should ever talk negatively in front of customers and that made me feel uncomfortable like hopefully I don't have you as my server and you talk about me too (we ended up sitting next to the table she was talking about but luckily didn't have her as a server). After we had been waiting for quite a while at the bar, the bartender went to the hostess to check since we had been waiting for longer than we had been told and it seemed that they forgot about us. We end up sitting at a table for 6 and it was just my boyfriend and I, which wasn't a big deal we were just glad the bartender noticed and took care of it for us. Our waitress was ok but definitely not the best. The managers were amazing and very helpful with tips on how to cook the steak and kept checking back on us. We will definitely be back, just think that the waitresses need a bit of work and professionalism!"}
{"text":"First trip here during lunch time in late February. I actually live rather close to this restaurant, drove past hundreds of times and finally took the time to go try the food. I have heard from other people that have been here also having a good experience.  Inside the decor is bare wood and hardware-esq. The dining area was well maintained and the staff were always professional. One entire wall is glass allowing you to watch the east end of the runway at Falcon Field and the airplane parking for the pilot school near the restaurant. I had no idea just how busy that airport is during the day but there's always something to watch out the windows.  If you look at their menu online please note this is the dinner menu, the lunch menu has different stuff so you cannot rely on the online menu to always be accurate, just an FYI. The dinner menu is larger.  I got a steak (of course) salad bar and sides. In a restaurant I prefer to let the people who know what they're doing cook the steak so I opted to let them do it rather than do it myself on one of those big cooking stones at the table, although watching other customers cook theirs I may try it next time I just didn't want to risk ruining my own reason for coming there in the first place. It took them about 27 minutes to deliver my steak but I repeatedly told them I was in no hurry.  My steak was cooked textbook perfect to order, the sides were adequate and well seasoned. The salad bar was nice but don't expect to see something like Sweet Tomatoes for a salad bar here, its not like that. They also had taco fillings and shells at the salad bar if you wanted to make one of those in addition to a salad. All in all the salad bar was nice, also clean and well maintained. The sides I ordered were sauteed mushrooms and garlic mashed potatoes, both were adequate but I think I could have made better at home so I doubt I will re-order them again, but there are plenty of others to try. Again, the lunch menu has different sides from the dinner menu.  So my first visit made a favorable impression and since this restaurant is literally up the street from my home I will certainly go back, perhaps next time for dinner.  If you want a table with a view of the airport I'm not sure how to time your arrival or if you can reserve one by phone but it wouldn't hurt to call and ask but it would be a nice touch if you're into the airport traffic thing. 480-830-6100 is the number from their web site.  I don't give too many restaurants a 5-star rating so 4 stars is about as high as you get from me for a meal under sixty dollars a person. To sum up my first visit here: the food was cooked correctly, tasted great, the wait service was top-notch, the dining area was clean and well maintained. Parking is easy in a private lot, simple short walk to the front door, which is near all the handicap parking spots. I think people tend to walk to the wrong part of the building expecting to see the front door closer to Higley but it's actually facing the west.   With food and tip I spent $40 for lunch and probably wont need to eat again today!"}
{"text":"First time here & we are all impressed!  Even my very picky husband!  Salad bar was wonderful!  We will return. Look forward to the one opening in Gilbert."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal at Steak and Stone (this is my second visit). I had the 10 oz sirloin, which I cooked to a very nice medium rare. My mother had the tri-tip which was really good. It is fun cooking on the stone and watching the planes land at the airport out the window. It didn't hurt that they serve beers from the brewery next door...the Wheat Beer was very good...and Hannah (our beautiful waitress) was great"}
{"text":"Great happy hour.   Our server, Tina was very helpful. Food was very good too.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"OK so I guess I have decided that if I'm going out to dinner I want somebody else to cook my food.   I ordered the smoked tri-tip and  I was told that it was smoke to medium rare and that I could heated up on the stone to bring it to whatever doneness I wanted.  When it arrived it was more than medium rare it was well done and there was no point in cooking an already over cooked meat so putting it on the stone just warmed it, for the most part I had cold meet for dinner and it was seasoned so much that my mouth was burning from the salt and the seasoning that I couldn't even taste the meat.   Just kind of a sad experience when I was trying to have a nice night out with my husband."}
{"text":"Heard some good things about this chain so I thought I would give a try. Overall very disappointing. Quality of meat wasn't inline with price.  Salad/hot food bar was disappointing as well. Service was ok, but waiter didn't inform us of the upcharges or lack of items they had on hand. So they substituted garnishes on mum moms burger without even asking what we wanted to do. Will not go back. Too many other quality places in this price range."}
{"text":"We ate here opening night and had a great experience.  I felt like a caveman cooking and eating off of a slab of smoldering stone.  The salad bar was delicious too and its awesome to find another place where one can eat a healthy no/low carb dinner that tastes great!  The prices were no more expensive than any other steakhouse, and cooking my own steak on a stone was something I'll definitely be back to do again."}
{"text":"Decent food. Decent ambiance   Great service from Tony. Would return to this restaurant wth friends in town as it's a fun one time place.  Make sure to go after sunset so windows are open to flightline."}
{"text":"We live nearby and were hoping for a good steak house. I should start by saying we did not do our research and did not realize what the \"stone\" in \"steak and stone\" was referring to until we were seated. To be honest we agreed that if we wanted to cook our own steak we would stay home and throw them on the grill and save a lot of money. Clearly the decorator has a Pinterest page for decorating with pallets. Once you get past the wooden walls things fall apart. The floor was dated and filthy. The waitress explained that we could have our steaks cooked in the kitchen which we did, but both of our steaks were way under cooked and cold. When I sent it back the manager visited. The vegetable \"medley\" were green beans, greasy and cold with poor flavor. The steak when cooked was tender. The cost was too high. 65 dollar bill for two steak dinners, no appetizers, cocktails or dessert. We have not found our steakhouse."}
{"text":"Great steaks, great service! Our server Brady was very attentive to our large party, she really took care of us. Thanks!"}
{"text":"What a fun and delicious place to eat! Kimberly provided great service and made our dinner experience even better. And the view of the mountains...love it!"}
{"text":"My family ate at Steak & Stone for dinner about a month ago. Six hours later 2 members of my family were treated in hospital with suspected food poisoning!  Hosts of nasty flies everywhere in this restaurant, a big no-no in an eating establishment! Beware!"}
{"text":"Probably the best steak I have ever had. Soooo much flavor and the bourbon sauce they have to go with it is sooo smooth. And you get to cook your steak the exact way you want it. Like no other steak you have ever had."}
{"text":"Excellent steaks, Excellent Experience, staff was awesome. But... avoid salad bar. It's a total joke, cost $8 extra and has about 12 items. I recommend you go just expect a salad!"}
{"text":"The side orders came out cold.  The 500 degree stone that you cook your filet on was not at 500 degrees so the filet mignon would not cook and would not sear. We were here for well over an hour waiting to be served and when finally served the sides weren't even at room temp. So I had the complete meal returned!!!  Not one person asked if our drinks could be refilled. Felt like I was rock in the corner!!   Will not be returning!  The manager was nice enough to pick the meal. Did make an attempt to satisfy the situation and make it better, but at 9:11 pm at night I'm way past the hour where I don't care to eat.  All I know is if Restaurant food inspector would have shown up, this place would have been shut down purely based on the temp. of the food."}
{"text":"We loved our steaks. Service was great. A very fun place. Fun experience to grill your steak at your table. Love that it was by Falcon Field!"}
{"text":"Wasn't bad but wasn't good either..  We came with in with a semi large party and everyone was just \"ok\" with their meals.  My stone went cold half way through cooking and I had to get another.  Service was slow i thought and for the price I would of rather have gone elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food was great but service was a little slow. We would have had more drinks but weren't asked. Their salad bar was good but expensive - $10 is high when already paying $25-40 for a steak."}
{"text":"Had a great birthday meal here. The steak was amazing and the service was awesome. Mike, our server, was amazing. Definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"This is a very cool concepts and fun experience for a date night. More importantly, dollar for dollar this is one of the best steaks I have had, a really good value; and the sweet cream corn side dish and honey bread are awesome. Far and away the best meal I have had in the east valley!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, seated at the bar and liked the friendly and knowledgeable personal service. Very cool concept using the hot stone. Live music was a plus. Made fore a nice evening!"}
{"text":"Got there early and sat next to the windows which was really cool watching the airplanes take off and land. The food was really good except the flies thought so also. We spent a great deal of the time swatting the flies away from our food."}
{"text":"My first visit and as soon as you walk in you can smell deliciousness right away! Got the 16 ounce ribeye. It was amazing. Service was very good. It's a bit pricey, but worth it. Try this place for sure."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our anniversary dinner here.  Fresh cut meats, neat casual atmosphere, go at your own pace and you cook exactly how you want it. Our waitress Tina made the evening perfect. She gave us the inside on tricks of cooking, pairings and made the time very fun."}
{"text":"Loved the view and the food was good.    The concept of finishing cooking your food on the table was awesome but I don't cook so I didn't hit the target like the chef would. My only other concern was I specifically asked for something when I placed my order. Food came but it didn't. Had to ask again two times and it finally showed up when asking for the doggie bag. I would definitely recommend you to check it out for a new experience"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and food! It is a really neat experience and you can cook the steak however you want. If you'd like them to cook the steak they can (especially helpful for kids)."}
{"text":"First visit with a Groupon. Got seated immediately with table near window. DON'T SIT THERE!! The tables are packed far too close to the next one making it nearly impossible to get up to go to the salad bar and hot bar. Forgot to get a soup spoon so ate my chili with a fork. Salad bar and hot bar for sides very good. Steak on the stone was really great. We had one ribeye, one New York, one filet and one sirloin and shrimp. All were very pleased with meat and had fun cooking them. Wife disappointed with HARD butter for her baked potato. Felt Zack or others could have been more attentive to our needs since we could not get up to return to salad or hot bar. Will probably return but will not sit at table near the window."}
{"text":"Very great atmosphere, long wait, WAY too loud live music (the waitress couldn't even hear me)!I literally  found chunks or ice in my salad. The staff was friendly and accommodating - but the sides (which used to be my favorite part) are now only available a la carte!"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant yesterday, I ordered the ribeye  on stone with salad/soup and my wife got the prime rib phily sandwich with fries.  There was to much salt on the sandwich and the fries were tastless, the ribeye meat quality is not good compare to its price and the onion soup wasn't good as well.  Service was good and fast, the restroom had bad smell and there wasn't toilet sheet.  I don't think we will go there again, as we could go to way better places for same cost (for two person paid $72)"}
{"text":"The concept is innovative and creative! Great atmosphere for family dinner. The steak ends up just the way you want it since you are in control of the cooking process, and not to mention is vey tender and juicy! We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"This place is great. We brought a huge group in and they accommodated us brilliantly. Our waitress \"Miller, B\" was so great. She kept our drinks refilled, brought our food out as fast at they could, and continually asked how everything was tasting. The atmosphere of this restaurant is stunning. It overlooks the airport. Your food gets delivered on a hot stone and you get to cook it to your liking. The prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"To sum it up:   Ruth Chris prices but no longer Logan's food quality / ambiance.  I give it two stars for the nice fun server.  Way over priced for what you get.  Steak(s) quality was just okay but roughly $50 for a steak it needs to be very good to great.  Sides were poor. Spent $300 (4 of us) for a maybe $175 meal. I'll be surprised if it lasts but prove me wrong.  For those prices I'd rather see a Flemings, Ruth Chris, Chart House, Maestros in Gilbert."}
{"text":"The Steak and Stone restaurant in Mesa is definitely the most amazing  place to experience gourmet steaks prepared on a hot lava stone. The ambience is a very special one too because you can enjoy breathtaking sunsets falling down  the runways at the the Falcon Field airport. You will be pampered by upbeat and very caring professional staff. Some evenings you may listen to guitar music or sim ilar. My husband and I have been here many times and were thrilled by entire, exceptional, enchanting experience. The best place to celebrate any special occasion with your loved ones. Jitka *********"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the food is delicious,the staff is friendly and there is a front row seat to Mesa airports runway right out the wall of windows..it is a little hidden gem of a resturant, and did i mention the food is amazing...the food is amazing...go....today."}
{"text":"Came here with family on last weekend. At first we have to wait a bit for big table near window because my uncle want to see the airport nearby. It was a majestic experience, steak was amazing and my family loved cooking it.!! Will come back soon"}
{"text":"This was great food and service. Wine prices for the Month of March are happy hour price for the time. The salad bar was good and the wait staff is wonderful."}
{"text":"The service here is one of the best we have experienced in a while. All of the wait staff help eachother out and are prompt, attentive and proficient. I had the steak & shrimp on a stone, my husband had the 12 oz. sirloin on a stone and they were fresh as well as good quality. The brews were flavorful as well. Desert Eagle Brewing is next door & I had the blonde, husband had the red.  Both were great! The Bourbon baked beans were fantastic! Prices points were decent, but on the higher end. The glazed chicken wings as an app were fantasticly seasoned as well. And we enjoyed the view of the airport at sunset. Overall, there is nothing i would change."}
{"text":"This will probably be a lengthy review, but I feel like it's warranted here. I bought a Groupon for a $30 lunch certificate in which I paid $18 for. It was the best $18 I've spent in a long time. The lunch menu looks much like the dinner menu but that's okay; the prices were a little less expensive and that's okay too.  First let me start off by saying any local or people that are semi native to the area would know this place as soon as they drove up. Steak and stone is located in the old Anzio's Landing space. One of my absolute favorite restaurants as a child growing up and the last time I visited anzio's Landing I was going to prom more than 20 years ago. That being said, it was very nostalgic walking into the place. I will say that the restaurant front needs a bit of work. I realize they haven't been open that long but where you park is the front of the restaurant and it looks like it's also the loading dock or restaurant supplies. I do know however, that there is a landing strip on the back side of the restaurant so it's kind of hard to unload anywhere else. The front door wasn't very clearly marked either and hopefully something like that will be in the works soon. I dined for lunch today with my 18 month old daughter and 7 year old son. We seated ourselves (because that's what the sign said) and of course we chose a window table because it's right on the landing strip of Falcon Field. We watched planes take off and watched an Army helicopter being towed and parked right outside our window. Me being sort of an aviation nerd, it was a great opportunity to share my love of airplanes with my son. Our server who, in her defense, had just gotten seated with a table of about 15 women and us at the very sametime, did take most of the meal to warm up to us. I did realize however, she was VERY busy. We were ready to order right after we got there. I had peeked at the menu before we had even arrived because I knew I was going with 2 kids that would surely die if not fed soon after our arrival. The salad bar was available to us immediately. It was a well stocked salad bar with fruit salad and a few different pasta/potato salads to choose from. I did notice someone had said something in a previous review about the faded labels. They are gone now and while it's not labeled at all, it was easy enough to decipher what was what. Fresh fruit would be a lovely addition to the salad bar. I ordered a 12 ounce ribeye with garlic mashed potatoes and my kids shared a 6-ounce steak bites meal with steak fries. This was more than enough for lunch. Of course, the meat came out on a hot stone. What a novel idea and wonderful concept. The steak was tender, juicy and totally worth the fact that I had to \"make my own meal\". My son absolutely enjoyed flipping the steak with his Fork. I will say however, it would have been really nice to have a small set of tongs to flip the steak instead of using a fork and knife. It was a little clumsy.   Our waitress did advise me at the beginning of our steak cooking, to cut the ribeye into smaller pieces. She said I would probably be there all day cooking the steak if I left it whole. I'm glad I didn't, I left the steak whole and got a wonderful medium temperature in about 12 minutes. It may have taken me a little bit longer but I don't believe in cutting steak while cooking. I think it's a cardinal sin. The steak was absolutely delicious with the exception of the fact that I think in the spices they use nutmeg. Which I'm not a big fan of, but none the less, the steak was still delicious. I would have been totally fine with just salt and pepper. A nice touch to the stone is that they add flaked salt to it. My son even added that the experience was magical or something to that effect! All in all we had a really good meal the only thing I could say that I was actually missing... like truly missing was a dinner roll or a small warm bread loaf when we sat down. None of these tiny tiny mishaps would lead me to leave anything but 5 stars. On a side-note the general manager is an absolute gem. He will be what keeps this place open for many years to come. We will be going back and will be going back often."}
{"text":"You either love the concept or don't  Staff will bring out a large safe platter on top sits a hot stone, you proceed to cook your steak to your desired level.  Our family absolutely loved it! Seasonings are on the table Once you select your protein then you can chose one buffet visit or the all you can eat option  Fresh food, decent salad bar.  helpful advice drop a dab of butter on Your stone before you lay the meat down for maximum flavor.  Thank you Phil for explaining everything and making our experience fun!"}
{"text":"Really good first experience here!  I had the molcajeta bowl and it was amazing blend of flavors. Lots of meat in mine. I opted to have all three proteins. Hubs had the steak bites. Very tender. Salad bar was fresh and had great options too!  We will be back. Nolan was very knowledgeable!"}
{"text":"I expected way better food for the price I was paying.  The service was terrible. Ordered simple drinks that took forever to reach our table and the server was not great in explaining how the whole process worked. The others dining with us ordered the prime rib and sent it back as it was cold and the meat was so tough they bent their fork. Having a hot stone sit in front of me the entire time I was trying to dine was an awful experience especially since the table was barely big enough for the four of us that were dining. The salad bar and the view were the only things that were good. I think the prices are ridiculous and have had way better at other steakhouses where my food was prepared for me. Will not be returning to this one that is for sure."}
{"text":"This place was so much fun! Dinner after working a BUSY Saturday for a treat! I had the 12 oz ribeye, hubs had the 16 oz. You cook your own steak on a 500 degree stone here...doesn't take but a moment. If you like it rare to medium rare, take the steak off the stone while you are nibbling or you will have a medium steak In seconds. Our server was Hilary, and she was absolutely outstanding! Lovely place for a date!"}
{"text":"This place has the best happy hour in town!  $1.50 for pints of beer and well drinks.  Wine is only $3.00.  And it's 7 days a week from 3-7!  The food is served in a unique way, you cook the meat yourself on a stone that's hot as hell.  They have a great salad bar and hot bar.  The servers and managers are great too.  Go there now!"}
{"text":"This place was definitely a different experience. But the food and drinks where great. Service and price was not 100% of what I was expecting. Coming back would only probably be with someone that hasn't experienced it... To let them try out the difference of cooking on a stone at your own table. ( the room of dinning was not ventilated very well which made it very Smokey well lots of bodies in the restaurant)"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and EXCELLENT service. Friendly staff and and an all around great experience.  Highly recommend you experience the unique approach to this phenomenal food experience. The manager,  Nolan the manager is super friendly and attentive to his guests ! Best dining experience I've had in Arizona in quite s while !!"}
{"text":"The steak was tender and juicy and of course cooked to perfection as I was doing the cooking! Interesting concept but when I go out Its to have my food cooked for me! The vegetables were good and garlic mash ok. The only real downside is I still smell like the place. We may or may not go back. Our server was amazing though and really walked us through it! Definitely worth going just for the experience."}
{"text":"Response was predictable, but you can't put lipstick on a pig and take her to the dance. We'll go to bob's burger barn before we will be back. 10's of thousands of one time visitors!"}
{"text":"Best experience! Brady was the best help for or first time. Celebrated a family birthday dinner and we will be back!"}
{"text":"It a trip eating your steak cooking your meat on a hot rock awesome concept. But the bread and the mushroom  in garlic and butter to die for. I got to go back here soon"}
{"text":"This is our third time to Steak and Stone and it does not disappoint. The steaks are wonderful! Yes, you have to cook your own steak, if you choose, but that's what makes the experience fun and different. Besides EVERY bite is hot and juicy. Pamela took excellent care of us this evening. We will be back and bring more family!"}
{"text":"I'd give Steak & Stone 3 & 1/2 stars.   When I found it on Yelp I was very excited to try something unique and new. It was a fun experience for sure and we loved cooking our own steaks at the table. The chef can't get your steak wrong if you're the chef right?   First impression was that the restaurant was very smokey. This makes sense because of the cooking happening in the dining room, however some better ventilation might be nice. After we left our clothing smelled of smoke and beef. Some might like that side effect   They started with bringing us bread and honey cinnamon butter. The butter was great.... But the bread disappointed as it seems someone forgot to add salt to the bread dough. If that wasn't the case then they should rethink the bread recipe as it was very obviously missing salt. The bread itself though was warm and chewy.   We tried several dishes. Sides were the creamed corn which had OK flavor, but was more runny that creamy. Sweet potato fries and the sauce served with them were fabulous. The house salad was OK, but not anything to write home about. The steaks were wonderful. We had the 12oz house and the 12oz new york. They were seasoned wonderfully,  the bourbon sauce was delicious and the steak cooked perfectly because we cooked it the way we like it. The other dish tried was the Lava Bowl. Think fajita bowl. It was flavorful and served with flour tortillas.   Over all it was a fun time. It's so unique and I will return once they've been open longer, but the first impression was that the sides are hit or miss. I'm hoping the bread was just a mistake with that batch of dough."}
{"text":"Great cuts of meat with a good salad bar.  Need I say more?  The waitress was friendly and kind. The service was quick and efficient.  The location however was kind of out of place for a casual steak place, but I do not know much about AZ so I can't really say.  I found this place with a Groupon deal and I want to add that I was not disappointed.   Thanks Steak and Stone."}
{"text":"We went here on a week night in Feb 2016 for my mom's birthday.  Unfortunately, the experience was horrible.  There was a big party in the restaurant at the same time as us; however none of the staff mentioned that our order would be delayed because of the large party.  We were there for over 2 hours and waited a good 1.5 hours before our food was served...uncooked mind you.    We were considering coming here again  when there wasn't a large party to give it another shot, but the food was not worth coming back for. The steak was unseasoned and had awful texture. It is understood that you cook the meat yourself on the stone at your table; which is why we were perplexed when it took so long to get out to us.   The manager took almost no responsibility for the situation.  I like to see local owned restaurants flourish and unfortunately this one will not earn our business again."}
{"text":"This place was just ok. I had to change out my stone because the waitress said that it wasn't hot... in my head I was thinking \"uhhh isn't this your speciality?\"   Expensive for having to cook it yourself. Outdated and smelly..."}
{"text":"Great service, great food! A lot for your buck! Nolans personality was perfect for his position! Was a neat experience, will def be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Our new go to steak place. Pricey if you get into fancy cuts but good lower price options. The steaks were amazing, great salad and side selections, and the sunset view is to die for."}
{"text":"Great new steakhouse that just opened up in Gilbert. Cooking the meat at the table on a huge hot stone was awesome. The prices were reasonable and the salad/side bar was ample. Overall, a great experience. Our server, Tina was fantastic. She made us feel welcome and made the experience a pleasurable one. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a really cool concept!  They bring out your steak on a hot stone and you finish cooking it yourself.  They also offer a very wide variety of steaks, even a 16 ounce Filet.  The service was great and the views were spectacular at sunset over the airport with the mountains in the backdrop.  They have some local brews on tap here too.  Overall a great experience.  I'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"After my last visit I didn't think I would ever go back, even though I live in the area. The manager emailed me and offered to make it right with a free meal. I've made it my personal policy to never take a discount or anything free when it comes to restaurant food or service issues. I think it's a nice offer but I want my thoughts to be free of that influence.  I stopped in a week ago and have to admit that the service and food had changed dramatically. My steak was lean and delicious, the staff was much more on top of giving world class service.  I'm glad they have stepped up to the challenge. We will be back again."}
{"text":"Best Steakhouse in northeast Mesa! However, I must remind you, we are talking about Mesa here where the competition is Outback Steakhouse and Applebee's. I think this place actually has a lot of potential.   Our night started off by calling in to see if we needed a reservation, which after having to call 3 times to get someone to answer, finally we were told the average wait time on a Saturday was 30-45 minutes. No problem, so we'll get a reservation. Not so fast, they only take reservations for parties greater than 6 people. Instead of getting discouraged we decided to drive down there and wait. The quoted wait time was accurate, and we waited 45 minutes. As we walked past the 8 open tables, we were shown to our booth.   The waitress was very nice and overly apologetic. I would like to say this was nice of her to do, but we didn't even complain. I overheard her apologize to the booths next to us, just the same as she had done to us. Overall, she did the best she could considering the circumstances.   The food itself, which was a little slow to come out was good. Cooking the steak yourself was interesting, but a unique concept. The steak itself had good flavor, and be sure to add their sauce when you cook it. The sides I would say we're decent, my wife enjoyed them more than I did.   The ambiance was very nice overlooking the runway at Falcon Field. The only complaint that some might have is that it does get a little smoky in there with everyone cooking their food at their tables. We left the restaurant smelling like we had just left the campsite. Not a big deal, just realize what you are getting yourself into.   Overall, like I had mentioned in my first paragraph, I think this place has great potential. I think bringing onboard the right manager quick would be the best money the owner could spend. Cool concept, lack of competition, in an area with the right demographics. The only thing lacking I'd say would be organization and consistency."}
{"text":"Great family dining experience. The salad bar was just I needed (fresh veggies) and the steak was very tender. It was really cool watching it sizzle on the stone. It was my first time here but not my last. Service was excellent and everyone here took great care of us."}
{"text":"The best steaks in town! Loved the experience we had cooking our own steak on a hot stone! The sides they offer are fabulous! It's something you need to experience! Every time we go it's great!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool way to have your meal. My filet mignon was absolutely tasty and tender. Did not need a knife to cut. We went on valentine's Day for lunch and they were a little short staffed. Will try again to see if they normally have better service. The waiter was too busy and didn't really have time to explain the cooking method to us as it was our first time there. But will give it another try."}
{"text":"Come try this place out. Everyone is very nice and the food is great. Stay tuned for the grand opening, January 8, 2016."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic, had the salad bar and although I usually don't eat the buffett, the ribs smelled sooo good I had to try them. Fantastic!! My wife's prime rib sandwich was excellent too.  We plan to eat there again before we leave town. Plus you can taxi your plane right up to the backdoor. Large lot with several tiedowns."}
{"text":"Came here right when the place opened. It reminded me of Germany when I first had my steak on stone there. We got offered A1 steak sauce along with other sauces. Steak was ok nothing too exciting. I think getting offered A1 steak sauce was a no go for me."}
{"text":"This place is the former location of Anzios Landing. The service was awful and for what you are paying(very expensive), you deserve better. The salad/meat bar adds $10 to your mealand the plates are tiny. The \"heated stone at your table\" is nothing more than a gimmick. My wifes steak never did cook correctly, so she took it home to our Shiba-Inu. I had the barbecue short ribs which were extremely sour and salty. Things went bad the minute we walked in. The wait- staff appeared to be millenials(lots of piercings and tattoos). Did I mention I was wearing a Donald Trump t-shirt my wife bought me? I must have triggered someone. I guess what they say is true: you can't go back again.......sad."}
{"text":"We went for lunch service and Nolan was our waiter. The food was awesome and Nolan provided outstanding service for us!  If you're looking to have a great dinning experience and eat some of the best steak and ribs you can find in the valley, you need to go here and ask to be seated in Nolan's section!  Five Stars for the food and the employees  at Steak and Stone!!! You ROCK!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great! Loved the experience. I gave them a four because they don't have good butter. Yes, it matters.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the customer service, value, quality of food, and atmosphere. The owner introduced himself and checked in with us throughout the dinner and my water was never half empty. I ordered the tritip and it was one of the most tender tritips I've had. They also give you some bourbon sauce to cook with which adds a pretty rich flavor to the meat. It's a fun experience cooking with the stone. It was a nice homey, yet classy atmosphere with great views of the airport landing strip. I can't wait to try the lunch menu and both dinner and lunch are very affordable (great value for the unique experience cooking with the rocks and the quality of food). The chocolate coconut pie in a mason jar was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Steak and stone is a very nice restaurant. You cook your steak or chicken on a super heated stone(500 degrees). The tri-tip is already cooked and steak bites are cooked quickly. Salad bar was great and numerous side dishes are available. Wait staff are very helpful. Children need to be watched as not to touch the stones. Come early because it fills up fast."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome and unique!! Awesome view of the air strip. Outside seating was cool even though it was dark and we couldn't see too much! Meat and cheese plate was super cool (and free thanks to Yelp!). Wait staff was helpful and friendly. I got filet medallions and I think hubby got the filet. It was yummy and a pretty awesome experience! The Mac and cheese wasn't my fav but I am a Mac & cheese connoisseur so.... overall super awesome place that I recommend to everyone I know here (sadly that isn't many)"}
{"text":"Steak was good, service was excellent. Hot bar was not good at all.  Salad bar was OK.  For the price it should have been alot better."}
{"text":"This restaurant is way out of our usual drive area, but I always did like this part of Mesa and if you jaunt around on the 202 you get a pretty good view of the mountains.  The concept sounded like something that would be fun to try and when they had a Groupon, I thought \"Why not?\"   As I was reading a few of the recent reviews, I have to agree with a lot of what Valerie M. said, with a few additions.  First, I am not a fan of salad wagons/bars and this one was pretty generic with basic lettuce and vegs and 3 or 4 mayo-based salads.  As we settled in with our beers and app, I noticed it just became a full circle of people inching around trying to stack up their plates.  If I do a salad bar, I always end up behind that person who is either trying to make it a work of art, is completely indecisive, or who, like my dad, is trying to pile 15 pounds of food on a small plate.  Takes forever.  Not interested in that mess.  I've got beer to drink and fried zucchini to eat.  I'd rather relax and enjoy looking out at the airport.  The good:  the fried zucchini, the garlic mash, the Founders Porter, and the ribeye.  Although, when the young man brought out our steak on the stone and then started cutting it into strips, my husband and I were both like, \"Whoa!  We've both worked a grill, I think we can handle a 500-degree rock.  I don't want to take a $34 ribeye and make it look like fajita meat\".  Good Lord.  I didn't like how he just took over and basically cooked it for us.  Calm down.  The cut and flavor was fine, but I wouldn't spend that much again and have it cut into strips.  Get a cheaper cut of meat.  The not so good:  the bbq baked beans, which smelled and tasted like those cheap Van de Camp's beans my mom would dump BBQ sauce in when we were kids and try to get us to eat them.  They tasted like that too.  No.  Also, I love supporting local breweries and with Desert Eagle right next door, the restaurant has a few of their beers on tap.  They had a porter that was ok, not as good as Founders, but ok.  Then we decided to try their blonde ale or lager, can't remember exactly what they called it, but that was terrible.  It tasted like the inside of a grain bin after harvest.  No.  Just no.     The GREAT: the smoked meat platter.  At $12.99 this is the best deal on the menu.  All the meats were delicious.    We really enjoyed that and decided that if we are back in that area we could see stopping in for a couple of cold beers and that platter.    Our server was friendly and efficient and all in with the drinks, apps, and dinner the total before the $50 Groupon was $68.48.  I could see bringing out-of-town guests here for the experience.  With a group this could be a fun time."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! I just wish they had one in So. Cal. Those place ruined steaks for me because I haven't been able to find a place that has even a fraction of the quality of steaks they do."}
{"text":"Took my mom there for her birthday.  We enjoyed the unique atmosphere.  Seemed short staffed that's why I'm giving 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is definitely a place to come back to. The atmosphere is very nice the servers are amazing and the food is second to none. Brittney and Jake where our servers and they were fantastic. Cooking the food on a 500° stone was pretty cool too. Make sure you use some of the seasonings provided on the table and cook your steak to order"}
{"text":"My husband and I found this restaurant last year and are dedicated customers.  The staff knows us and the manager makes it a point to visit every table to make sure your dining experience is up to par.  They have a large selection of steaks to choose from, we have has the filet, the sirloin and steak bites.  The cuts of meat never have excess fat or stringy parts.    the steaks are served with a large lava stone heated to 500 degrees, and you cook your steak on the stone to your liking.  They have many nice side dishes including sweet potato fries, baked beans, and steak fries to name a few.  They serve homemade bread after 4:00pm.   We have never had a bad meal here and the staff has always been awesome.  They have a nice dessert menu as well.  The non-alcoholic drinks are served in large mason jars so you don't have to keep asking for refills.   Our daughter enjoys cooking her own steak on her own stone.  They also provide sauces that can be placed on the stone to cook with your steak.  Would highly recommend Steak and Stone to anyone who wants a great steak and fun way to cook it."}
{"text":"The food was awesome. My wife and I shared the smoke meat sampler and the six ounce sirloin. The garlic mashed potatoes are wonderful. The service, by Tess, was great. The concept of cooking your steak at the table makes for a fun/interesting experience. Sat immediately at 5 PM on a Saturday. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here with a group of friends, we all thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The food was excellent, the atmosphere was inviting, we enjoyed watching the activity on the airfield and the wait staff was very attentive and friendly. We are looking forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"Overall our experience was positive. I would go again. The view was nice, we were there at sunset. I'd recommend reservations, especially if you'd like patio seating. Food was OK. I loved the creamed corn and homemade bread. The steak was not as amazing as I had hoped. For the money I'd probably pick Flemmings. But the experience was fun. Cooking steak on a stone, where else can you do that? They were extremely busy while we were there and we waited quite a while for our steak, but they were very kind about it and acknowledged our waiting even before we could mention it. Extended a nice discount for our inconvenience. Good people, good food, great view."}
{"text":"I strongly suggest this place to everyone. I took my girlfriend, my best friend, and his fiance to-be to \"steak and stone\" because I've been there once before and I really enjoyed my first experience. This time I really needed the experience to be extra special. Jenna helped me organize the whole experience so my friend could propose to his fiance. Our server Tony was in on it too. The whole staff made the experience a night to remember. The steak was amazing and the beer was awesome too. Tonys' service was nothing short of first-class. Everything about the night was perfect! Thank you again Jenna  for all of your help. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My wife ordered the Filet Mignon with garlic mashed potatoes. This place served her POWDERED potatoes with a friggin' filet mignon. Is there even a need for further explanation? Gordon Ramsay's colorful vocabulary can't come close to describing how moronic this is."}
{"text":"So.... Interesting concept.... You cook your own steak on a hot f#*king rock. The sweet cream corn side is awesome. The steak was very flavorful. Good place."}
{"text":"This was our first experience to Steak & Stone.  The \"stone cooked\" steak was fantastic.  Service was exceptional and the food was excellent.  We tried the peach cobbler for dessert...we will return just for the cobbler if necessary!"}
{"text":"Best way to describe this place is an overpriced sizzler where you cook your own food. Salad bar was basic normal salad bar. Nothing special, nothing to write home about. Lettuce, a few topping, and some dressing. The beans from the hot side tasted like they were fresh out of a can. Everything on the salad bar was like that, no special care or prep, just normal stuff. The steaks were decent, but for $34 each I could have just gone to Frys, got a Ribeye just as good or better for $8, and cooked it myself at home. The cooking your food yourself is a neat concept, just poorly executed. The stones took up a huge amount of space and made it tough to get to the sides. The bread was the hands down the worst bread of any place I've had, ever. Stale, cold, and no flavor. My steak was at least 30% inedible being gristle and fat, but my wife's was not.   Service was good. Only thing I could complain about service was the \"loaded baked potato\" was $2 extra, when baked potatoes, cheese, sour cream are all available as part of the salad bar. I didn't see the $2 extra on the menu, and paying $2 for chives and some bacon bits is a bit extreme considering the rest is all included as part of the salad bar.   Dinner for 2 was $107 after tax/tip. For $107 I'll goto the Keg or just spend the extra for  Steak 44, Maestros, Ruth Chris and actually get a good steak, not a cook it your self grocery store steak. For 1/2 as much you can get a nice meal at Texas Roadhouse.   It was extremely noisey inside too,  so if you are looking for nice, or romantic, or good date place, skip it.  Besides the $2 potato charge there is nothing the server can do about the business model or poor pricing. No way I would return unless prices were cut in at least half. This is coming from someone that spends good money on steaks. $250 on a Wagyu tomahawk at steak 44 is   a normal nice meal and worth it for the steak you get but $33+ for what is worse than a $5 grocery store steak is basically robbery."}
{"text":"Top notch service.  Top notch food.  Today was the first day myself and my daughters came to Steak and Stone.  Upon being seated we felt like home.  Brandy our server was amazing.  Her personality was over the top amazing like a sister.  Other servers followed suit and every single one equally amazing.  I have never been to a place that felt the warmth and love as here.  Since being first times Brady explained the menu very clearly with so much enthusiasm.  You can tell all the servers are treated well.  Kudos to the owner.  I had the Mocajete which was exceptional.  My girls had a great time cooking their own rib eyes on a stone.  The uniqueness brought to the table made the overall experience fun and comfortable.  And to be checked on throughout your meal placed a right little bow on a very pretty gift.  I was not in the best mood prior to arriving.  Thank you for putting a smile on my face with great service and great food.  Definitely coming back to being my boyfriend"}
{"text":"We always have a great time here. Pam and Tony are the best servers EVER. The steaks are never frozen and they are always fresh. The food is always on point. This place is a must go for date night or just because. The owner even speaks and makes us feel like family!"}
{"text":"Great food!  Really fun to cook on the stone.  The environment is more casual than I would have thought but overall the experience was good."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It is a great concept, you cook the steak to your liking! I definitely will be recommending it!"}
{"text":"While the location and concept was promising the service and experience fell short.  The location, formerly Anzio's Landing sits just off the taxi way of Mesa's Falcon Field Airport and is a great place to watch planes take off and land.  The interior is very dated and looks like it has not been kept up well. Walking through the restaurant the vibe felt like a cheep buffet rather than a steak house. This was reinforced by the salad bar and our hosts seemingly constant reinforcement that you are only entitled to one trip to the salad bar.   While we were informed there was a wait, we ended up sitting at the table for 75 minutes before our food arrived. A table that was seated at the same time as out party had finished their meals and was on their way out as our food was arriving.   The liquor selection is typical of 'east mesa', nothing noteworthy. It would seem the definition of 'neat' here, means with ice. Disappointing.   The service was doing their best, however clearly not experienced in dinning or the service industry.  By the end of the evening, my eyes were extremely irritated by the 'smoke' from the table grilling process. The establishment does not seem to have given any thought in to cycling fresh air in to the building. The smell reminds me of a typical greasy spoon diner and that smell stays in your clothing for the ride home.   The steak was good and the concept is good, however for the money spent, you would sadly get a better meal and experience down the road at a Chilies."}
{"text":"Wow!! Just wow!  What a fantastic place.  My husband and I went not really knowing what to expect, we were pleasantly surprised.  Our waitress and another waiter made us feel like we have been going there for years.   The manager came over to make sure everything was okay and was soooo friendly.  Now let's talk about the food, so delicious!  Truly a unique experience, I highly recommend this amazing restaurant."}
{"text":"Stephanie was our server. She was awesome! Made sure everything was perfect and what a smile! The food as usual was yummy! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Enjoyable experience and great food. We had fun with the Mojicate bowls, basically a fajita bowl. It was also cool to watch the planes take off from Falcon Field."}
{"text":"Went here on a date night! The location was great and we enjoyed the food and service. However felt this restaurant could use a few minor improvements. The environment feels a little more upscale than the details. Adding more things like a draft list and cloth napkins would help improve the overall atmosphere."}
{"text":"The meat was fantastic. The atmosphere amazing. Great experience. I mean grilling a steak on a hot stone isn't something you get at just any restaurant. I highly recommend giving this place a go!   On the down side, the food at the hot bar was not very tasty. I wish I had just gone with a side potato. And I wouldn't recommend this place for families. I'd hate to see a toddler or infant get his hand on one of those stones."}
{"text":"This is a fun, and delicious place to go for dinner. We were a little unsure at first, but after trying it - it has become our go-to steak place. Their prices are affordable and their cuts of meat are very good! Glad that there is finally a good restaurant in this location!"}
{"text":"I had been told to have a meal at this restaurant for a few months.  I was expecting a real dining experience.  The restaurant is spare in decore. The table is thick wood and very rustic and uneven. The chairs were uncomfortable. We were offered a \"special \" salad bar. The items were very minimal. The soup was tasty but cold. Our sirloin arrived on the stone for us to cook. The pieces were of the quality I would categorize as trim. It was fatty and grizzled. We can understand the fun of the concept but it is expensive and the quality is poor. On the bright side, our server was great."}
{"text":"Great place! Delicious food and atmosphere. The view at sunset is amazing. Must try \"the bowl\"!"}
{"text":"Great Concept, Great Food   The evening we went it was a silent opening.   The staff needed some more time to train with customers.   Wished the liquor license was ready.  I would of loved a glass of wine with my DELICIOUS steak.  The bourbon sauce is 'the bomb' .   Met the owners and they are very nice and accommodating to your needs.    Will definitely go back.  East Mesa needed this."}
{"text":"Total 5 star place!! If we could, it would be a 5 plus!  We have had this bookmarked to try for a long time....we should have come sooner!! Taste bud heaven!  We had steak tips and filet mignon as our entrees with  cream corn and steak fries as our sides. The salad bar came with the meal. We also partook of the yelp check in offer and chose the fried zucchini and pickles. Literally everything we ate was fantastic.   It was great to be able to cook the meat to our liking and fun too. They suggested cutting the steak as it cooked to get medium well. That worked really well.    We left stuffed and had leftovers... but couldn't pass up trying the desserts since everything else was so good. We have the brownie and peach pie packed away to eat as soon as my tummy has room!  Service was friendly, informative and overall amazing (Thank you Brady!).  I'm so glad a new one is opening in Gilbert, closer to where we live. It sounds like it's arriving just in time for our 27th anniversary too!"}
{"text":"First time here. Was looking forward to an early Mother's Day dinner. Upon sliding into the booth, I sunk into a hole where there was no foam and hit the board beneath. So that's where I had to sit because there were six of us.     This entire place stinks of rotten smoke. It's a very off putting smell. The carpet under the tables is GROSS. Everything in there just seems dirty and ill kempt. Right down to the shades on the window which were dirty and crooked by our table.  I ordered the salad bar because, honestly? The steaks were ridiculously over priced. I think the 16 oz was 42 bucks if I remember right. My husband got the tri tip and some mashed potatoes. The tri tip was pre smoked and came in five small slices. He didn't mind it but didn't think it was worth the price.  My nephew got the steak tips but his stone got cold before the meat was cooked and our waitress was nowhere to be found.  Everyone else in our party was MEH about their food at best.  The salad bar has some soups/chili and a pathetic offering of actual salad items. The chili was ok,  but the beef stroganoff was basically just smushed noodles and a few pieces of hamburger. It was absolutely DISGUSTING. I paid for the \"endless\" salad bar but the plates were so small that I would have had to go back four times just to get a decent meal. I'm sure that's by design. You wouldn't want someone actually eating 15 dollars worth of your cheap salad bar crap, right? I'm sure they make a lot of money with those tiny plates.   Bottom line, it's really smoky and not a good smell. It's way way overpriced for what you get. The place is in dire need of a good cleaning, a better air filtration system, and some remodeling. At least fix the booth with the hole in it?  Instead of being happy about our Mother's Day celebration, I feel kinda dirty, hungry and annoyed. I think they need an overhaul or they're gonna be out of business soon. I'm always very skeptical of bad reviews because I know there are a lot of picky, unhappy people in this world. I am none of those things and I don't get offended easily. So this one star review means a lot from me.    UPDATE:  I got an answer on this review from the CEO of the company. He is basically blaming all their problems on being popular.  So I guess being popular keeps you from cleaning -  and fixing broken items?  It keeps you from making better food?  It keeps you from proactively finding ways to reduce the acrid/rotten smell of smoke?   Look, I rarely go out to eat. When I do, my expectations are not high. I absolutely prefer my own cooking and I am a good cook. For instance, my beef stroganoff would put this place's to shame. How is that possible?  I have no training. I am not a chef. The tri tip, hamburgers, beef tips and ribs that I've cooked at home would put this place to shame. Again, how is that possible?    I'm asking in earnest.  Do you guys need a better chef? I'd be more than willing to put your food to shame. I can bring a dish of stroganoff, a rack of smoked ribs, etc.     I'm not trying to be mean. I just want you to understand  - your food is NOT THAT GOOD and your restaurant is dirty and ill kempt.  I feel I'm doing you a favor by holding you to a higher standard than you hold yourselves.   My advice:   1. Hire a new head chef.  2. Spend a good portion of the morning, before opening, cleaning.  3. Spend a good portion of each week doing touch up paint, fixing broken items, etc.  4. Eat every piece of your food on a daily basis.  5. Hold your staff accountable.  6. Fix your price issues. Of course you need to make money, but (for instance) give salad bar customers a bigger plate and more delicious, fresh choices! 7. Install an air filter. If you already have one, get a better one.   That's a start.  I also wanted to add that we have many friends who've told us (since our dinner there and after I wrote my review) that this place was great when it first opened. They say it's gone downhill quickly.   They all complain of the same issues - nasty rotten smoke smell, dirty, sub par food, absent staff."}
{"text":"Overpriced for average steak, and I found cooking it yourself on a stone to be more inconvenient and annoying than unique. Just alright."}
{"text":"Just okay describes everyone's entree in our party of 5.  Cooked on a stone concept is unique but the steak lacks flavor.  Questionable whether it was even seasoned.  We ordered a barbecue sampler platter to share and that was just okay as well.  I was really hoping it would be awesome because the concept is so cool that it would be great to take guests.  While the inside of the restaurant was old and nothing impressive, the view of the airplanes outside was cool."}
{"text":"We will definitely try it again next time we are in the area because the steak was so good."}
{"text":"Fun concept, our waiter Tony was very friendly.  I will say for $35 my steak shouldnt have had the amount of fat that it did but, the meat was tasty.  The side is VERY SMALL but I wasnt there for the sides... the bread and honey butter were tasty.  The hot rock and raw meat did take 40 minutes to come out (This was 7pm on a TUESDAY) not sure why it takes that long if theyre not cooking it (If they do cook it its an additional 25 minutes- WOW)The desert he said was homemade (Restaurant made) we got the brownie and ice cream... honestly it was dry and Ive made better at home... save the money on desert. The salad bar was out of at least 1/3 of the stuff both times I went to check it out... I made do with what was there again wasnt there for salad either.  4star just due to the little stuff... I will be back"}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time at Steak & Stone and we all had a great experience.  Not only was the food superior, but the whole concept was as well.  On top of that, the service was very pleasing. Not sure if it's standard to pretty much get 2 servers at once or if my busser (think his name was Ben) was just on top of his game as much as he was tonight. He helped grabbed our sides from the hot bar, he refilled our water glasses, and he made sure we had to go boxes all night he checked on us constantly. With all that being said,  Steak & Stone will now one of my regular spots and Ben will be requested by me as much as possible."}
{"text":"Oh golly pleas if you want to actually go home the nite you mistakenly come here to have dinner you have to get on your hand and knees to have your order taken and your bill. We asked the owner for our bill that did not work but thank goodness after an hr trying to get our bill the waitress came by and we asked again for our bill and she said oh did you eat already. REALLY!!!!!! If you absolutely have to go here pls bring a sleeping bag. I  not going to even mention them raising the rates and lessening the food You have been warned.  Also now to have the salad bar you have to forfeit your side and pay an extra 7.00"}
{"text":"Well this was the worst restaurant experience of my life. The hostess was nonexistent for at least five minutes when we walked in, so things didn't start off well.  She told us we would have a 15 minute wait, there were many open tables in both the regular seating area the bar and outside, and she didn't even come back to seat us so we waited longer than the original wait time. She was working multiple jobs and was not available. When we were finally seated at a table that was in a very awkward placement,  our waitress brought our water glasses as requested but forgot the lemon. One of the glasses was absolutely filthy when I went to take my first drink. The menu selection and the sides situation was extremely confusing half of the salad bar was open for self serve, the other half, the baked potato half, was only for servers. So when we went to the salad bar, half of the items were empty or frozen because they were at the bottom of the container. I am paying the same price for a salad bar as people that come at 5:30 PM. All of the containers should have plenty of vegetables in them and not to be frozen. So once we got our salads, we were enjoying them. The blue cheese was very tasty. I mentioned to the waitress that I was upset about needing to pay full price for a salad bar that was not at full service. She let the manager know and he came over and told us he would comp our salads and asked if I wanted any sides. I said mushrooms would be great. One waiter brought out our steaks at the same time. The waiter started to give us directions for our steaks the first of which was using our steak knives to flip the steak. We had no steak knives.  He said \"oh you don't? I will have to go to the back and wash them.\" Seriously! He went back and washed steak knives! Meanwhile the steaks are cooking away on two of the stones, my stone wasn't hot enough to even cook my steak.  At this point I was done. I mean done! The waiter came by that had initially served our steaks and the most unbelievable thing happened, he started saying yes you should complain to the manager and yes you should complain to yelp because that's how changes will happen. At this point I told him to walk away because he was just making it worse. AND the baked potatoes and mushrooms never came! Then the manager comes back and does everything he can to make us stay, he offers to re-cook the steaks, at this point none of us have any appetite for anything that is served from the steak and stone. He did the right thing and comped our meal but we will never go back!  So we went to the Hub on Stapley road because we ALWAYS get great food and great service!"}
{"text":"We love Steak and Stone! I've tried the kabobs and a couple of the steaks on the stone and by far prefer the steak on a stone. They're SO GOOD!! The bad part is we usually eat some from the salad bar too and are too stuffed to eat it all. Someday I plan on trying chicken or one of the other options... but I love the steak so much it's hard to do!  Service has been friendly and informative too! PS: garlic mushrooms are REALLY garlicky"}
{"text":"The food was good but our service was absolutely amazing! Liz J was one of the very best servers we have ever had! She was great with the kids, explained everything (it was our first time) and was completely on the ball! If you go to this location definitely ask for her! You will. It be disappointed!! We loved her!"}
{"text":"Loved this steakhouse!! Sooo much fun! Worth every penny!  Love the whole idea of steak cooking on a stone! The waiters, hosts and general manager  were nothing short of amazing! Food was delicious! We had the ribeye and the sauce they gave us was to die for. We decided to do all the sides for 12 and I think it's worth it. Also love that they have salad bar. And the view is fun since it's right next to falcon field.  Excited to go back again"}
{"text":"This is the second time going to dinner for date nite with my wife. The atmosphere is comfortable and inviting. The service and friendliness is outstanding. Grant and Mike did a fantastic job."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to steak and stone for the first time to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. It was an amazing experience from the moment we walked in. We ordered the fillet mignon, they brought it to our table on a stone. It only took a few minutes to cook our steak it was absolutely delicious. The salad bar, and the sidebar had a great selection to choose from. The staff was very attentive towards us. Especially this awesome server name Nora.we are so excited we found a new place to eat. We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in our last visit on Saturday. Had been here on two other occasions and it was wonderful. Apparently beginning the first of this year the structure changed and so did the prices! Prior to 2018, there were two wonderful food bars; a hot bar and a cold bar which were included in the price of your meal. Now there is a $7 up-charge. The hot bar had six or seven choices of what I will call mush! I was expecting to get a baked potato from the hot bar as I did the previous two visits; wrong! We were fortunate enough to get one from a manager though, so we lucked out. You do get a choice of one aide when you order, and we could have gotten the potato as that side, but if you wanted anything else you had to pay the $7. The 12oz fillet went up to $66!!! WHAT! That's right $66! I've been to upscale steak houses in Scottsdale and didn't pay that. The manager used the minimum wage hike as an excuse. That may be a factor in rising prices, but that was a large increase over last visit; around a $15 hike! I will say in all fairness that the steak was good, but now I will probably think harder about eating here again. There are nicer places to eat steak for lower prices."}
{"text":"Service was so, so. Steaks were decent but overall way overpriced for what you get. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"We dined at the Gilbert location tonight and I think some of the kinks still need to be worked out at that newer location.  We were hoping for a leisurely dinner, a few drinks, and we were rushed in and out in under an hour.    My husband and I ordered the salad bar - but we had to wait for our salad plates and got them only after asking about them.  Once we returned to the table, we then had to ask for napkins and silverware.   Then once we had our silverware, our steaks arrived a couple of minutes later.  We did not have steak knives at that point - however, the steaks were so tender, we were able to cut them with our butter knives!    We also had to ask the waiter for our waters that we ordered with our wine initially.   The steaks were excellent, but the process was so rushed we did not enjoy ourselves.  My son ordered a quesadilla from the kids menu and it was so overcooked, the tortilla was black.  They did make a new one for him - that my husband had to finish cooking on his stone because the cheese was not melted.    In our opinion, there is nothing that special about the salad bar, customers should be able to swap that out as a side and not be charged an extra $7 to do so.  We had dined at the Mesa location several months ago and very much enjoyed our experience.  It will be awhile before we return to the Gilbert location."}
{"text":"The concept of serving steak on a stone is a cool idea.  The food was great and so was the service.  I recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for the first time and absolutely loved it. I feel like it is very hard to find a place that has good steak but the steak here is amazing. I loved being able to cut up each piece and cook them individually. Every bite was hot unlike all the other steak house restaurants. You could actually enjoy a dinner conversation without the worry of your food getting too cold. If anything (including my cream corn or baked potato) got too cold, I just threw it back on the stone and it warmed right up. You simply can't compare this place to anything. I would highly recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"This was an awesome experience!! Great for someone who wants to cook steak at their own temperature and Tina is the best birthday singer and waitress!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Food is fantastic and the service is top notch! We did the lunch and salad bar! Great deal and unlimited! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is so fun! Completely different than anything we have experienced before. For those of you that haven't been, you chose the steak portion and cut you'd like. Then you chose either the hot bar that has a variety of options, or sides from the salad bar. Our server was Sonja, she was great, friendly and answered all our questions. Nolan was even more so wonderful. He checked on us frequently and ensured our visit was amazing. We will be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here. My wife got a groupon a while ago. I was not sure what to expect. The steak was one of the best I have had in a while. I got the New York strip. It was a lot of fun cutting and cooking the steak to my desire. The building is a little dated but overall it was good and I would return even without having a groupon. They have a new location in Gilbert I would like to try next."}
{"text":"This place was great, I have been wanting to come for awhile, but out of habit we end up always going to our normal restaurant. I am glad we went, service was great and fast. Tony our server was the best. He was super helpful and he explain and showed us how the process worked of cooking you steak on a stone. We will go back again and recommend this place to our friends and family."}
{"text":"An interesting take on having a steak done truly your way. I was curious about how they would handle a super hot cook stone at the table. It was kinda cool and fun. The steak was good and side bars were ok too."}
{"text":"Between the trip to the salad bar, bread, steak and a side...it was A LOT of food. My husband and I tried all the different rubs for the steaks and they were all flavorful. The staff was attentive and the manager came over 2x just to see how we were doing since this was our first time. Fun experience... gonna bring the kids back next time...!"}
{"text":"This place was a surprise. We were here from vacation and tried it out due to the other reviews.   The place was spacious and the service was good. Now the best thing: the food.  The steaks were great.  We got the filet migon, and two rib eyes.  It came out over the sizzling rock plates and it was delicious.      They have their own seasoning but to be honest, it doesn't need it.  The steaks were great on its own.  This was a nice find during our stay."}
{"text":"This place is awesome... Cooking on a stone and helicopters in the background taking off... What more could you ask for? Oh yeah the food is delish too!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Your steak comes out on a hot stone, you season it and cook it to your liking. Delicious! We got there just before 5pm on a Saturday night and definitely beat the rush. By the time we were done, people were lining up. Great addition to gilbert road. Everybody young and old cleaned their plates. Steaks, sides, drinks were delicious!"}
{"text":"Cool ambience of grilling steak on a hot stone!  Smells awesome!  Good sides and salad bar."}
{"text":"Service was painfully slow. Our server was very friendly but they looked short staffed. I'm not the type to rush through a meal and I'll wait a long time for some good food but this place didn't deliver on that, either. Three of us got the molcajete bowl and not one of us liked it. I don't think it ever cooled down enough to be able to taste. The shrimp over cooked in the bowl and by the time it got to the table it was tough. I don't think anyone who got the bowl came close to finishing it. It just wasn't good, especially having waited so long to get it. My boyfriend had the steak bites and described them as \"meh\". My parents had actually eaten there a few weeks prior and said it was a similar experience.  This place just isn't for us, I suppose"}
{"text":"This was a great experience but mostly for the novelty factor. Cooking your steak on a hot stone was really cool. The sides were all pretty average, no stand outs. I tasted the garlic mushrooms, mashed potatoes, cream corn, and mac n cheese. They were all ok.   I don't think the price is quite worth it. To me, one of the reasons steakhouse prices are so high is because of how well they cook the steaks. When you put that kind of responsibility in the hands of the people, the result is disappointing. This was the case for me, I let my steak stay on the stone too long and it was too well done. But of course there's no one to blame but me; and therein lies the beauty of this restaurant.  Even though I messed up my steak I definitely still enjoyed it, and the entire experience. I'll most likely be back here."}
{"text":"The most amazing place to eat!! Great experience and super tender and flavorful steak You cook it to your liking on your own stone. The service from Jennifer and Nolan was the best!! Highly recommend the food and service"}
{"text":"Terrible service, worst waiter ever and marginal food for a big price tag. Never b back"}
{"text":"This was our first experience to Steak and Stone.  The restaurant was clean and very well staffed.  We sat at the bar at first.   Kris, was our server and extremely knowledgeable and helpful.  The salad bar was exceptional and extremely fresh!  Our steaks were superb and the Mac and cheese was delicious!!! Highly recommend this restaurant.  Perfect for a first date!"}
{"text":"I work across the street from this restaurant and I can't believe it took me so long to give it a try! I stopped in for lunch with two coworkers and was pleasantly surprised at the great service and ample lunch entrée choices. I ordered the cut up in strips, tri-tip on a stone that came with a side as well as access to the salad bar. The salad bar was definitely the star of the show! There were tons of toppings to choose from as well as various macaroni, potato and pasta salad options. Service was great and they continually checked on us which was nice. My only complaint was how long it took for our meat to come out of the kitchen. I mean you cook it at you're table so it shouldn't take long to throw a raw piece of meat on a hot stone. Overall, great place and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful experience! I have nothing bad to say about any part of this restaurant from the serving staff to the food everything was better than I could've asked for. First of all our server, Anissa, was one of the most cheerful, helpful, and best servers I've ever had. On top of that the rest of the staff were happy and cheerful which reflects greatly on the management. The manager checked on us as well as the owner. I love that the owner was in house with his staff, you can tell he really cares about his restaurant as well as his staff. Not only was the environment friendly and inviting but the food was amazing. Being able to cook your own food on a 500 degree stone was amazing. I would definitely recommend this restaurant, in fact my mother in law is visiting this weekend and we already know where to take her. Great place to eat, if you haven't been here, get off your butts and go!"}
{"text":"Got first cut of Filet Mignon, didn't taste right.  The chef replaced it with an excellent cut.   Good service, I would recommend it."}
{"text":"If you don't mind having to remind your waiter that you're still waiting for your drinks, your entree while others in your party have been served, your steak knives, the side you had ordered, etc then you might like this place. Very poor service. Had to get up and carve our own prime rib since no one would bring it! (and it wasn't self service). Then the food: Stone was not hot enough to cook the meat properly. So instead of nice, browned steak you get grey meat that tastes like it has been boiled or simmered, making the meat too tough. The $50 prime rib was terrible: one thing is medium rare and one thing is a cold, partially cooked prime rib with solid white (raw) fat on it. Had to cook it on my husband's semi hot stone. Nope, won't be back."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. Not impressed at all! The food was just ok. The prices are very high considering you have to flavor and cook your own meat. The coffee was horrendous. The only reason they even get one star is because the wait staff was friendly and tried their best."}
{"text":"We first went to Steak and Stones in a remote town of Myton UT.  We were wondering how such a fabulous Steakhouse would be out in the middle of no-where!   Well, when we saw it move into the old Anzio's Landing Restaurant in Mesa, we just had to go!   We took friends and enjoyed it very much!   Every bite was yummy and nothing gets cold by cooking on your own stone - nor does your steak get over or under cooked!  It's perfect.   Fabulous!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place and it was one of our favorite places. The past couple times we have gone, we have been less and less impressed. Increased prices and lack of service. If I am paying for a sit down restaurant, I want my water to be filled when its empty. I shouldn't have to wave down the waiter hanging out in the back to get some water. When my steak was brought out on the stone, it was cold. The people I was with were done with their food before my steak started cooking. They finally brought me out a hot stone and the server wasn't very polite."}
{"text":"My lady and I decided on a date night at Steak & Stone. We arrived shortly before 5 pm on Wednesday evening and pleasantly, to our surprise, we discovered we were among the first customers.   We were warmly welcomed by the front entrance staff and we were seated at a table near the front of the restaurant where the extensive salad and hot food bars are located.   Kristine was our server and I have to say, she was absolutely amazing with her high level of attentiveness and service. Kristine and he colleague Daniel checked on with us multiple times during our enjoyable meal.  Additionally, the entire staff at Steak and Stone act as an overall team as we had multiple (this was in addition to our main and wonderful server, Kristine) team members check to ensure we were enjoying our experience. Thank you ALL for your kind and attentive service.  When I checked in here on YELP, a free starter offer was presented to me to be used immediately.  We gratefully used the coupon. I showed our digital coupon to Kristine who applied it and brought us our selection of nachos with chicken added.  My lady and I thoroughly enjoyed them. Please see attached photos taken during this evening's dinning experience.  We had Sirloin Steak Bites & the 6 oz Top Sirloin Steak, each were priced $12.99. We also enjoyed sauteed mushrooms and sweet potatoes as our sides. We also very much enjoyed our visit to the extensive salad and hot bars.  When our beef selections were brought out to our table on sizzling 3-4 inch thick natural stones, Kristine showed my lady how to cook her selection on one of the sizzling stones. One small suggestion, as my lady does not enjoy too much salt, for those that are watching your sodium consumption, you may wish to inform the staff not to sprinkle the coarse ground salt on their meat selection and serving platter.   Additionally. we enjoyed some wine ($10 per glass) to accompany our meals.   I've included a selection of photos from our overall experience here at Steak & Stone this evening. My fellow Yelpers I hope these photos will provide a glimpse of what you can expect should you decide to dine at Steak & Stone. As for my lady and myself, we'll definitely return again.   One tip,  I'd recommend to arrive early or a bit latter in the evening as it became crowded (mind you, this is during the off season for our snowbird vistors) about 20 minutes after our arrival, so we just beat the proverbial crowd. I imagine that there's a wait on weekends and during the Winter when our snowbird visitors have returned.  Lastly,  our bill was exactly $50 and that included Kristine backing off our appetizer/starter and did not include our tip that we presented to our excellent server, Kristine.    Overall, my lady and and I enjoyed our date night at Steak & Stone. Thanks to the wonderful staff for a memorable dining experience!  Hook 'em!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't come here again but it was just ok. We waited over 1.5 hours for our food. We did have a party of 20 with kids. We all had to take shifts taking screaming kids outside cause they didn't even bring the kids food out early. The view is amazing. The restaurant is really quiet even though it was full. My husband ordered the steak on the stone and he says it was just ok. He said it was kind of tough. I got pork tacos. They were alright. They were only $9. It was just smoked pork with some cabbage and bbq sauce. I wish it had some kind of a kick to it. The sauce was good. I might add some sour cream and some spice to it. The steamed veggies were good. It just seemed odd that we waited over 1.5 hours for our food and then we still had to cook it when it came. It felt like we were there forever. People we went with had been there before and said the bread was terrible but when it came it was really good so I think they fixed their terrible bread issue (although, the recipe needs salt). I would say try this place once. They are new so maybe they will get their act together soon."}
{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE, This is not my first time at steak and stoned. A handful of times I had great service but the service was AWFUL and what is up with this new menu!? I am not pleased with what they are doing to steak and stone"}
{"text":"Great food.   Cook to your own perfection.  First time for friends and they loved it.   We'll all be back."}
{"text":"We were going to try out your restaurant until we saw that you give discounts to Boeing, Waxies, and Falcon field.  We have lived in this area for many years and always feel slighted for never getting  discounts. I am sure other residents that don't work at those locations feel the same way. We will not come to your restaurant  because of this."}
{"text":"I had read about this place and always wanted to try it....so glad we did!   Yummy!!!! Such a unique idea!!! Food is delicious! Service is excellent! The view is tremendous.  Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"The absolute BEST steak I've ever experienced. So tasty, tender and flavorful. Such a neat, unique dining experience. I would definitely love to come back."}
{"text":"This review is solely for the atmosphere, staff interactions, and 1 1/2 hour wait time to be seated after being advised twice it was initially a 15-20 minute wait. Restaurant was severely understaffed, employees were complaining to each other. After being seated it was 15 additional minutes before the waiter said he would be right with us. After taking our food order (he did NOT ask us if we wanted anything to drink or start with an appetizer). This consequently ruined what was suppose to be a special evening, and no consideration or even acknowledgement from manager. We got up and left after dealing with the unpleasant waiter and after being told it would take an additional 35 minutes to prepare the food, this was at 8pm and they close at 9pm. I would NOT recommend this place to colleagues at Boeing unless they have staff to support busy weekend dinner service. Extremely disappointed in Steak and Stone. Would have loved to try their food. Another suggested place was like a cheesy, lower end Sizzlers. I would have to agree. And the way they have their bar setup, one bartender making drinks for the entire restaurant, and having to wait on two tables!!! I'm not sure who owns this fine establishment, but they should take serious consideration into applying for a spot on Gordon Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares! Solely for the help on how to effectively manage dinner service and customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"The inside is nice but not what I expect for a $40 a person restaurant. A little country, think Texas Roadhouse. However the quality of steak is that of a high end steakhouse. It has a neat gimmick where you cook your steak at your table on a hot stone. It actually worked very well and I enjoyed the perfect med rare rib eye. Good selection of on tap craft beers and excellent service! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We really enjoy this place. Cooking your steak on the stone at your table is a lot of fun and you can get it exactly how you like it. We also really enjoy their excellent salad bar. Everything is always very fresh and the salad bar is very clean and well maintained. We will continue to go here, it's fun and the food is good."}
{"text":"The steak here is great and it so much fun to cook on the big lava stone. We also loved the salad bar and creamed corn. The lava bowl was a little skimpy on meat and very spicy. I love really spicy food and this was almost too hot to eat. The owner also stopped by to check on everything which was a nice touch. We also love watching all the airplanes land and take off. So happy to have this place near our home. We have been several times and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great date night place! Our server in the bar was very friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the food. Cooking your own meat is fun and plus the desserts are the best. Will come back."}
{"text":"Request Tony or Pam for your server. Their both AWESOME . The food is amazing. The sweet corn  is to die for. The sirloin is so tender and the best part is that you get to cook it on a stone that's 500 degrees. A great experience!!!"}
{"text":"I posted a review on a different account (Facebook ) This is a wonderful restaurant, Brady was exceptional, made the entire experience better, we were there for our daughter's birthday, and she absolutely loves it.  The general manager made us feel welcome and was really interested in making our dining the best possible experience, great steaks, great concept, great atmosphere... We have found our steakhouse"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place something different because they bring your steak out on a lava rock that you cook to your liking it had wonderful flavor. Kind of a rustic up BBQ place has a nice outdoor seating area. I found this place to be pretty darn clean.. (whoop,whoop gotta love that)great place to bring your family. Full bar with 12 taps."}
{"text":"A fun atmosphere. Delicious steaks and a great experience. Had the sirloin steak on a hot stone ($14) and subbed my side for the salad/hot bar ($7). Reasonable prices for what i got, even though there are much higher options. Definitely will come back, makes a great date night."}
{"text":"Sizzling steak that melts in your mouth!  Our party enjoyed steak and seafood and we all loved the flavor and tenderness of our entrees"}
{"text":"Pretty cool concept.  Came here on a Friday night at about 5pm. Was seated right away with no wait.   You cook your steak on a stone slab which was fun to do.  Definitely worth checking out for the novelty of it. Your meal comes with two sides (one of which is a salad bar that you can opt out of).   I am assuming the owner or manager came out with our steaks and chatted with us on the best ways to prepare them and different options to do. He offered us a bourbon glaze that was really great.   Bill was very reasonable priced."}
{"text":"Delicious, quick, and such a fun experience! Our server, Nora, was super nice and very accommodating. We each had the sirloin, which we got to cook and season to our liking on a hot stone right at our table!"}
{"text":"Great place. Upcoming future for the business. Ryan was the server and very upbeat. The chef stopped and told us how their fresh beef came from Tolleson and it had a great taste. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I cane here based on good reviews and am impressed. 15% Veteran discount is cool and so is beer selection at the bar. I ordered a steak takeaway and drank a couple Nitrogen Oatmeal beers while I checked my sales on EBay. Bartender was on point and food was eventually done. I ordered 12 oz Filet Mignon Well and it was butterfly style and I got home and it was still tender. It was a expensive but high quality steak and went great with horseradish.  I recommend Steak and Stone."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this restaurant and we found it to be a nice change from a usual steak restaurant. They bring out 500F stones and you can cook your steak at your own table if you desire. We really liked the rustic environment and the views of the planes taking off and landing at Falcon field were amazing. Our server was very nice and helpful. We found it fun to cook our steak bites on the stone and they had different seasonings to choose from. The steak fries were super good and we almost ordered more. The philly prime rib sandwich was good and had a lot of flavor. They have a nice salad bar and the hot bar was a wonderful addition. The brownie ice cream desert was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Amazing Food!! Great Service! Absolutely coming back! We came here not knowing much about the restaurant but we were not dissapointed! Where else do you watch your steak cook in front of you on a 500 degree stone? So Cool!!!"}
{"text":"What a novel concept, not only do you get to cook your own steak but you get to season it as well, so the only Chef you can complain about is yourself. The cuts of meat are well-trimmed and great quality. The salad bar is lacking in nothing but bacon, how can you have a salad bar without bacon? And the desserts are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Fun and delicious. This is an experience u will love. U cook ur own steak on a ROCK. Yes a rock. They gave us the instructions and let u loose.  Not only is it delicious, great service, a very big selection of great cuts of meat. We ordered rib eye, filet and strip steak.  Had a blast. With friends in Mesa Az. Larry an Kathy and we have really enjoyed the food and experience. Fun and great food. Very friendly staff. Came over and helped with seasoning and sauces. A glaze that is outstanding. Huge salad bar and hot bar. U leave full and laughing. We will b talking about this experience for a while. A+ to our server Karlie was really a pleasure an informative. Great experience. Thanks."}
{"text":"The food from the taco bar tasted old. Their wasn't much of a variety on it. The restaurant smelled musty"}
{"text":"Steak and stone did not disappoint! Awesome experience cooking our own steak on a stone. Drinks and hospitality were amazing - be sure to ask for Mike!"}
{"text":"Place has declined since we visited last summer.  Meat was tough, server was less than friendly and ladies room was filthy.  Not returning"}
{"text":"Can I give this 6 stars?  Love the concept of your steak coming out on stone that is 500-1000 degrees and the steak cooks in front of you! Even though I didn't get the timing quite perfect on the steak it was still amazing - next time we cut the steak up first - if you don't it takes some time (duh....). There was rock bowl thing called molcajete bowl (lava bowl) my wife ordered that was amazing as well, nice and spicy with tortillas. Staff was good. When they open number two they will upgrade the decor I'm sure - but this place is about the food and it is awesome.  Not cheap, but what really great steak is?"}
{"text":"This was my third visit to Steak and Stone.  My first visit was about a year ago and it was for a friends birthday party.  I thought the concept was interesting, but the service was VERY slow.  I chalked that up to us having a large group, even though we came in at staggered times and we had all had to pre-order what we wanted.  I was willing to try again with just my wife and I.  We live close by and went back a few months later.  The service was a bit faster, but not very friendly, and the cleanliness of the place left a lot to be desired.  Over the weekend, I had a business associate in town with his wife.  They wanted to try something different and I, (unfortunately), suggested Steak and Stone.  they thought the idea sounded great, but once again, the service was very slow, the place was to very clean, the staff seem like they want to be anywhere but at work and this time, the steak was not a very good cut for myself or my associates wife.  We all left disappointed and commenting that \"Well, it sounded like a nice place, but we don't need to go back.\"  So disappointing."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a date, we sat outside in the patio around 6:30pm. The service was great. The ambiance was very nice and relaxing because there was live music. I ordered the tri-tip 12 oz, a fully loaded baked potato and garlic mushrooms. My steak was good not necessarily great for the price we paid. My baked potato was lukewarm when it got to our table. Probably won't go back for a while but it is definitely a nice place to go for a special occasion like a date, birthday or Anniversary."}
{"text":"Excellent experience! If you order \"off the stone,\" which I recommend, they bring your meat out on a hot stone and give you some instruction on the best way to cook your meat. The seasonings are on the table, so you can decide the level and type of flavor to add to your masterpiece. There are many options for sides, including a salad bar, complementary bread for the table, and friendly staff. When I was there, live music was also playing (at a reasonable volume for the restaurant) which added nice ambiance. Four stars because when it gets busy in the evening, they may assume you're familiar with cooking steak and give minimal instruction. Make sure to ask questions about cooking your meal if you're not sure."}
{"text":"Amazing concept for a steakhouse. The steak and the ribs just melted in my mouth. It was the best birthday dinner I have had in years. The service was a little slow for that time of day, maybe they were just understaffed at that time. Overall, the meat was just incredible."}
{"text":"My in-laws brought me to this rustic restaurant to celebrate my birthday in a unique way. Steak and Stone is such a cool experience and I highly recommend checking it out!  Pick your cut and size of meat and it will come out served raw on a sizzling hot stone atop a large (think wider than your shoulder width) metal plate. They'll serve a loaf of bread with honey butter for the table and you'll get one trip to a cold salad bar with several pasta salad choices in addition to a traditional build-your-own house salad. You'll also get a hot side dish with your meal - I highly recommend the garlic mashed potatoes. Delish!  Make sure you try the key lime pie for dessert. Omg. Soooo good and it's a healthy portion. Really, everything is healthy portions!   Great staff, delicious food, and fun dining experience!"}
{"text":"Thought we would try something new, and it was close to home.  Have to say we were pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed our meals.  Very unique concept and the staff was exceptionally helpful."}
{"text":"Excellent service and fantastic cut of beef.  the whole cook it on the stone thing was awesome, as I love my food hot from beginning to end.  Smoked meat and cheese tray was out of this world!  Definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great ability to cook your own steak on a large stone. I will be back  just north of mccellips and higly"}
{"text":"First time here...ask for June as your waitress. She was friendly, fun & helpful!  Awesome food. Was a little skeptical about cooking my filet, but it turned out perfect!  Highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"This was amazing! Took my wife here for her birthday, Tony was our waiter and I couldn't have been more happy. Tony is great and made sure we had everything we needed and had all questions answered. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Came in for our first time today to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. I really love the concept of this place. It reminds me of this amazing restaurant in Boise, Idaho called Barbacoa Grill and I was excited to have something like that locally. But after our first visit I'm not sure if we'll be coming back again.     Our server was so busy taking care of other tables he completely forgot our drinks. We had to ask a couple times just to get them. All the servers seemed to be selling off the ribeye saying it was their favorite because it was the most flavorful & tender so that leaded me to order the 12oz ribeye while my boyfriend got the New York strip. When our order came out I was really disappointed to see my cut of meat. It was mostly all FAT. I'm not usually someone to complain at a restaurant but I'm paying for meat not inedible fat. I felt really cheated with my meal.     Our server told me he'd replace my cut but by that time my boyfriend was almost done eating & I didn't want to waste the actual meat I could eat. I decided to just eat what I could and one of the managers settled it by taking a % off our bill. The whole experience was just a little off... Getting our drinks was a burden, dealing with my fatty ribeye, boyfriend asked for steak sauce & it never came. Disappointed with tonight for sure."}
{"text":"Our first time here. Interesting way to cook your steak at the table. Every bite was hot and fresh. Quality meat. Great service. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and fun, different concept cooking your own steak at the table! All the waitresses were outgoing and fun!"}
{"text":"Even though it was slow to start, our hostess Judy was very friendly, going out her way to ensure we didn't feel missed.  We arrived at 11am just as restaurant was opening,  one hostess to wait on 4 large parties including us and other random patrons at the same time.  Once the other waitress arrived it was smooth sailing. For the type of restaurant the food was good, salad bar had a lot of variety and the desserts yummy. We tried all of them btw, the peach cobbler was good, different.. using an Angel Food cake as crust.  Zagat and Yelp were right on with the ratings...."}
{"text":"This was our third visit in four months. Steak and Stone has become my most favorite restaurant in the valley. It's definitely worth the drive. Be prepared to wait for a seat and enjoy a cocktail or beer next door at Desert Eagle Brewing. For the 2nd time in a row we had Christie as our server. She's fun, energetic, and very accommodating! You know a restaurant offers great service with a good product when the manager comes around to make sure you are satisfied. Thank you once again to the 25 staff that make this restaurant hop."}
{"text":"The food is excellent! The steak is very tender and flavorful. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because there are a few issues with the service that need to be worked out. Our server was very slow with refills and forgot to refill several drinks at the table. Maybe they should invest in bigger cups. Our server also seemed a little frazzled. As they have been open only a short time, I am sure our next experience will be 5 stars."}
{"text":"First time here. Food was amazing, fun environment, staff was amazing. Highly recommend, will be back again!"}
{"text":"Erica was great!  Her service was fantastic.  She knew when to bring drink refills etc.  She was professional and the food was great!  The steak was good and the sides as well.  I've been to both locations and they are equally as good! We will be back.   Our waitress was good with our kids."}
{"text":"Not worth a second visit. Steaks brought to table on super hot stones. I had to cut up the steak into small pieces to cook on the hot stone. I prefer not to have to cook when I go out."}
{"text":"Fun experience to cook your steak on a stone.  Hint: put your filet on a side plate and cook the slices at you leasure.  The stone will stay hot throughout your meal."}
{"text":"Excellent steaks good customer service even tho we had to wait an extra hour but well worth it  we will be coming back with the whole family"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a business lunch.  The waiter strongly recommended the ribeye (of course not because it's the most expensive thing on their menu), so being a steak lover, I ordered the ribeye.  I am still shocked at what a nasty cut of meat the \"ribeye\" was.  It was 75% slimy chunky fat.  Now I know ribeye is naturally a fattier steak, but this was just nasty.  I asked the waiter about it, and he casually said \"ribeye is a fatty steak\".  These guys have no idea what they're doing.  If you're looking for a good steak avoid this place!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our visit to steak and stone, this place is like a minute away from my house and I had been wanting to try it for a while, well today is Easter and we finally decided to give it a try, I ordered a molcajete with shrimp and steak and my mom ordered the shrimp molcajete , my husband had the tri-tip steak and he really enjoyed it, i have to say the sauce in the molcajete was very delicious! I also think their patio setting is very unique and in general it was a very good experience with very friendly service ! Also their happy hour is amazing ! I'm glad this place is so close to me ! We will be returning soon !"}
{"text":"A little rough around the edges but the steaks are good and the service is unique. Go to the one in Gilbert for your birthday and the operatic waitress will be happy to belt you out her rendition of the traditional tune"}
{"text":"Great lunch menu plenty of food. We got the lava bowl and taco lunch special.. tortilla need to be fresher."}
{"text":"This is a neat idea and the place has a nice atmosphere. The tables at the booths are a bit tall, which makes it awkward to raise your arms enough while sitting to cook your steak on the stone. I recommend you get a table instead. The tables are much lower than the booths.  The bread they bring out is hot and fresh, but very bland. It's as if the place is anti-sodium. The bread needed salt. The bread is served with a ramekin of cinnamon-honey butter. It was just okay.  I ordered the Rib Eye steak and my wife had the Molcajete Lava Bowl. The lava bowl is simply served way too hot. It bubbles and boils over at your table, which is fantastic to look at, but not so much to eat. They should bring out a ladle and a small bowl, so the person trying to eat it has a chance for it to cool down much faster than it ever will in the stone bowl they serve it in. The taste was just okay. It comes with tortillas.  Cooking steak on the stone was fairly simple, but the Rib Eye was so big, it was hard to keep pieces of it from falling into the coals. It would be nice if they put a grate under stone to catch any meat that falls.  You simply cut the steak into thin pieces if you want to make it well-done, or cut it thicker to cook it more rare. Pretty simple process. The steak has NO seasoning and there is a tiny drizzle of kosher salt on the stone. I was not offered any steak sauce nor did I see any other diners with it. Once I added table salt and pepper, the steak had much better flavor.  The fries are a steak-fry (thick cut) and have a weird seasoning that tastes like cinnamon. I wish they would have used salt and pepper instead. I think the fry's would have tasted better if they would have left them alone and let the customer use the salt and pepper at the table, which we needed to do for the bread and the steak anyway.  The salad bar is just a typical salad bar - nothing to write home about.  There is a 50% off coupon in the free New Times magazine, which they accepted for one entree. Therefore, my Rib Eye was only $17. Pretty good deal!  We drove from Glendale to eat here and it was quite a drive. The location used to be an Italian restaurant and its located at Falcon Field airport in Mesa. Looking out the windows of the restaurant you can watch planes taking off and landing.   I also like that all the servers were in their 20's and 30's. No young teens working here. So there was a level of maturity of the servers that is appropriate for this atmosphere.  This may be a great place to take family and friends who like fondue or Teppanyaki-style restaurants where you do your own cooking and have time to enjoy a conversation while you're doing it. This is not a place you go if you are in a hurry.  Overall, I think the food was very bland as a result of no seasoning, and the things they did season should NOT have been seasoned.   They serve Coke (not Pepsi, yay!) and its served in a large mason jar, so there was never a time where my drink needed to be refilled, which is good, because our server, while very friendly, disappeared for most of our meal.  Hence 3 stars out of 5.  It's worth it to go for the experience, but I wish I could say it was also worth it to go for the food."}
{"text":"Just walked in and I am sold already! Decor comfortable....can't wait to try the 500 degree stone to cook my own steak....I will be back! Today I will have the hamburger with sweet potatoes!!!"}
{"text":"WOW!!! My son and I went to get a beef fill and celebrate my birthday :) early!  I ordered the prime rib, served on the weekends only, and YUM YUM YUM!!! My son had the Rib Eye, he loved it, the meat stays the temperature you wish, because the stone stays at the table if you wish, to warm up the food as you wish!. So much fun cooking ones own meat to satisfaction.. like fondue only heartier! Haven't had a perfect meal like that with attention to detail (so sweet) in a long time. This Steakhouse aims to please! Thank you Steak & Stone, U ROCK Steak!!! ;))) And the server, Mario, Very Nice, Respectable and Attentive.  We have gone again to eat here and just like before, delicious!!. We really like this place :)"}
{"text":"AWFUL.  A thousand times awful.  Service was slow. Took at least 10 minutes to get a drink after ordering.  The waitress was trying so hard to leave we could barely season the steak before she flipped it and ran.   I made the mistake of going to the bathroom. I nearly busted my entire booty due to the massive leak. I mentioned that I thought that there may be a leak to the waitress.  She just says, ya, we know... So I paid $42 for a poorly seasoned steak that I had to cook myself in a loud restaurant with a leaky bathroom that almost took me out. Good times.   They offer a free dessert if you leave a good review. Not today sir! I'm not lying for free peach cobbler. Now if they had chocolate cake things may be different.  But alas, there was nothing on the dessert menu worthy of selling my Yelp soul."}
{"text":"The food was very good , as was the service. Wife had house steak , I had the prime rib. Prime Rib was just that,,, Prime.. Very good!!  Sides were good as well, baked beans, Melody vegetables, prices are reasonable . I will be back..."}
{"text":"We've now been there 4 times in 2 weeks.   The food is AWESOME, the staff is super friendly but we're looking forward to their new mixologist's Caribbean drinks.   Can't wait!   I need a Bushwacker,  a  Painkiller and maybe a walk the plank. Yum!"}
{"text":"What a lovely surprise. Service was very helpful and friendly. Mountain view with an occasional plane landing. I got the steak pieces, my husband got the sirloin strip.  Great flavor and we enjoyed being able to control the cooking. Big lunch hot bar and salad bar were available. Maybe we'll try that next time because we'll be back."}
{"text":"A vegetarian/vegan will find choices limited.  We were able to purchase the salad bar with hot side dishes so it wasn't totally horrid. Those who are meat eaters were very satisfied with their choices. They loved the cooking rocks, said the meat was very tender and flavorful.  Short people will find their chins on their plates. Maybe lowering the table would be an idea. The waiter was friendly and knowledgeable. For what it is, a steakhouse, they do a great job."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The service was great the food was delicious. The prices where really reasonable. Our server Callie treated us amazing. It was really fun atmosphere. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"As a Chicagoan, I take my steak seriously. And there's a lot of pressure here to prepare my own filet on my hot stone. But with the expert guidance of Hannah, my spunky server/sommelier;) , I managed to make a delicious meal. The cut was excellent- a tender and flavorful filet mignon - and, while the bevy of seasonings provided were lovely, I found that the simple rock salt preparation that came with the stone was more than enough to complement the meat. The steak fries dabbed in the \"barbacoa\" seasoning and the garlic mushrooms were excellent companions to the steak. The bottle of Meiomi was steady as ever.  While not a local, I plan on revisiting this place on my next trip SW."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. The restaurant is on the east end of falcon field. They allow you to cook your own steaks on a hot stone. The rest of the food is also good."}
{"text":"Four stars for the steak.  It was delicious.  A few things they need to fix though: - The cheap Salad bar labels, made with an office-file label maker.  All the labels are faded.  Probably wouldn't have noticed, except I assumed the only white creamy dressing was ranch.  Nope.  Blue cheese.  I don't mind blue cheese, but you need to be expecting it to enjoy it.  Couldn't tell, because the cheap labels are so faded.  They need to invest in engraved labels. - The boring salad bar.  Not much to write about.  Lettuce, 5 or 6 standard toppings, a few dressings.  Boring.  If the salad bar is one part of a three part dinner package (steak, side, salad bar), it should include something noteworthy or a lot of staples. - The weird way they restock the Salad bar - one side at a time, very slowly.  Half the (already limited) options were empty.  I thought I'd wait for them to restock it.  I watched this waiter bring one item out every few minutes before I gave up and went with what they had. - The mushroom side.  Very tasty, but they should be whole mushrooms.  Hard to navigate finely sliced mushrooms on a fork over a hot rock and a tray of pumice.  Might work if all the food was on one plate, but it's not. - A staff issue I observed.  A waitress was speaking off-puttingly to the hostess when I arrived about another staffer, saying he had no right to approve whatever they were talking about.  She was probably right about whatever point she was trying to make, but she was rude and loud and that shit needs to stay behind kitchen walls.  It was my first impression of the restaurant.  When the waitress left, the hostess said \"I'm sorry about that.\"  I felt sorry for her.  I avoid places where I pitty the staff. I'll go back because the steak was very good.  Eating it from a sizzling rock was awesome.  I'm a convert.  But if the salad bar isn't better on my return, I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I gotta say, the steak is pretty good and it's pretty cool to cook your meat on the stone. Though, it does take quite some time for food to come out. Overall though, food tasted pretty good. Wasn't anything out of this world.   What really got me downgrading on the stars for this review is the fact that their customer service is poor. The server who served our food was downright rude. It was unnecessary. We dont mind if he's had a long day and had a bad day, but don't take it out on us. He had no enthusiasm and did not care. We asked him simple questions as to what are the different seasonings for the steaks and he just had his hand on his hip and looked at us like we were stupid and to top it off didn't even answer the simple questions. All we wanted to know was what was in them, geez. I thought it was so rude. We told our waitress, and she gave us a brownie for a bday we were celebrating and just a 10% discount for our bill. They checked on us here and there which I thought was confusing because it wasn't even busy at all. Not sure if I'll come back here or even recommend this place to anyone else if the service is going to be this rude. Wish I had a better experience than I did tonight."}
{"text":"This is a great place. Tina is very friendly and helpful. Happy hour has awesome prices and food tastes great."}
{"text":"Mike our bartender/waiter was super awesome! Attentive and always had everything we needed. Great food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"And this location is way more upscale than the Mesa location. We will come back again. The salad bar is fresh and the service was great, the only down side was not an updated happy hour menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I are originally from NJ and we moved here two years ago. We have been to plenty of restaurants in that time and we have not found \"the place\" until tonight.  For us \"the place\" will be our go to restaurant for excellent food at a very fair price. Great steaks, salad bar and a hot bar included! Our waitress Anissa was truly awesome and attentive too! I'm in love with this place :)!"}
{"text":"Cool experience, good quality steak. We were a party of 6 and all got the filet. I'm not a buffet person but the buffet style salad and fixings is just fine - kept VERY clean at our visit which was a busy Saturday night. Only complaint was that it took 30 minutes (no exaggeration) to get our drink tab from the bartender who was running all over the place."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place. There is one in Mesa and one in Gilbert on Gilbert Road. The food was awesome and it was fun to have it sizzling cutting it up and having some awesome steak. I thought it might be distracting while enjoying a great meal but it was so easy and fun!  Definitely recommend it!!"}
{"text":"We went to Steak and Stone for the first time tonight and we enjoyed the experience. I got the filet. I loved the Stone they brought the steak out on. The flavor of the steak was great.   We started with smoked meat, cheese, and veggies. It was a great app to start with."}
{"text":"The service was great, salad bar very good and the cut of meat average.  We were a group of six with 1 stone on the cool side.  Took a long time to cook one of the two 6 oz filets.  For me, they are over priced especially when you think about having to cook your own steak."}
{"text":"Awesome view and great food. Great place to take a hot date.   Kimberly was a wonderful host. We were suggested the bourbon sauce that was on the secret menu. Always looking for an opportunity to enjoy this place."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place with delicious food, friendly service and a great atmosphere come to Steak & Stone. The meat is top quality, salad bar with the freshest ingredients and refreshing ice tea. Topped off with amazing deserts! We loved the peach cobbler! The view of planes coming in and out of the quaint Falcon Field airport is beautiful! This is one of Mesa's best spots for sure!"}
{"text":"We tried this place after reading all of the positive reviews online. Unfortunately, our service was not stellar. Once drinks had been brought and our order placed, we didn't see our server again until AFTER the manager walked by and asked how we were doing. By this time, we'd sat with empty cups for more than a half hour and our steak was already half cooked with no seasoning other than the kosher salt they add in the back. Don't get me wrong, the steak was all right, but the salad bar and the hot bar were just ok. The manager offered dessert, wine & cocktails (which we took none of) to make up for it and was super apologetic (I appreciated her concern) however when the bill came and we were asked to pay full price for literally no service, I was shocked especially after such acknowledged lousy service. I'm sure the waitress was busy & just having an off night, and as a former waitress I totally empathize. But management was aware of the situation and not because we were making a stink but because she just walked by and noticed us. I feel like management should have comped part of our meal or offered a gift certificate to try them again. I give this place 2 stars because not only was the service not great but the food was just meh I'd say the best part was the presentation of the steak, but that's why you're gonna try it, right?   I don't have any desire to go spend anymore money there but cheers to you having a better experience if you give it a try!"}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch as we were passing through the area. What a neat experience. I had the steak bites that I cooked on the salt rock at my table. It was cooked it just right! My husband had the smoked pork platter and really liked it. Our entrees came with the salad bar which has some different items on it which is always nice. The side items that came our meals garlic mash potatoes & fried zucchini were not good at all. Service was ok."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch there today. We both ordered the pulled pork sandwich. It came with coleslaw. We waited for 40 minutes after we ordered to get these two big buns and about 2 bites of meat on them, the coleslaw was so runny you had to use a spoon if you chose to eat it. For $9 a piece this was the worst lunch. My husband had a coke it was watered down. When the waitress asked how it was when she saw our plates. Coleslaw not eaten, buns taken off meat, I told her. The manager came over and gave us 10% off our meal. Big whoop! We left $20 gone and still hungry. Thumbs down! Won't go back!"}
{"text":"First time at Steak and Stone and will be coming back! Grant was fantastic at explaining how the process works with the Steak and the Stone. We had the Steak bites to share with our table of 4; perfect as an appetizer. 3 of us enjoyed the salad bar which was fresh and easy. For our entree's we had the Filet Medallions and they were fantastic! Also couldn't help but love their suspenders."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience! They were slightly unprepared even though we had a reservation,but the service made up for it, so I still have to give the place 5 stars for the overall experience. We waited at the bar before being sat and the bartender was extremely friendly,which matched the tone of the entire staff. Multiple servers asked if everything was okay throughout the meal,and they all offered to answer questions,as the process of cooking your own steak on a 500 degree rock at your table might be different to some. We ordered 2 Ribeyes, both with veggies, and it was all delicious. We ate every bite. They have plenty of room in the restaurant,great patio,a great bar with sports on,and are located just outside of the chaos of downtown Gilbert. Plus there's something awesomely medieval about cooking your steak on those rocks. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing! I had the ribeye, my husband had sirloin  and our friends had the fajita bowl and salad bar. Everyone enjoyed what they got. Excited to come back and try something new."}
{"text":"Unique idea, cooking your own steak on a hot stone at your table. However, side dishes arrived well after we cooked & consumed our steaks. Drink orders before dinner arrived but second orders never did. Honestly, with hot stone, dinner plate, side dishes and drinks there's not enough room to be comfortable. What's needed:  Bigger tables and prompt service."}
{"text":"Our first time at Steak and Stone in Gilbert and had a great experience! Steak was amazing and service was even better. Live music made the experience even more enjoyable, which they do every Saturday night. Our server was Grant in the bar area and he was awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty neat!!!!!! I found it when randomly searching for a \"Hot and New\" place to dine and am glad we went here. The steaks apparently are cut to order and are brought to the table rare. They are served on a 500+ degree Fahrenheit stone and cooks right in front of us! It surprisingly doesn't take that long to cook. There is seasoning on the table so we were able to cook our steak and season it as we saw fit. The idea is really neat. As for the taste, I couldn't tell if the stone contributed some flavor or if it was something else, but I really enjoyed its taste. I tried a piece of the filet mignon and it was tender, very juicy. I ordered ribs, and those were served the usual way. They came out cooked with BBQ sauce on top. The meat literally fell off the rib, but I thought the taste was mediocre, mostly because the BBQ sauce wasn't that great. The rib also had more fat than I would have liked.  The steaks do come with a visit to the salad bar and a \"hot plate\" item. The menu has two types of pricing: one with a single visit to the salad bar and one with unlimited visits to the salad bar. Price difference is about $10. The salad bar has the usual fresh veggie and pasta/potato/etc salad option. It isn't enormous, but it is enough to get full.  This is where it gets confusing. The salad bar does also contain \"hot plate\" items, but you're limited to one item per meal, if you're not paying for the unlimited option. However, nothing is labeled accordingly and literally, the \"hot plate\" items are right next to the salad bar, so it's easy to think that those were a part of the salad bar as well. Honestly, I don't even know if my understanding of this is correct since the menu was extremely confusing. Our server explained it to us and there were random exceptions. Example: mac n cheese and cream corn are a \"hot plate\" item so theoretically they should come from the salad bar area. However, they actually come from the kitchen. Anyway, to fully understand the menu, one really has to read the menu and pay attention to the server, which is slightly difficult when you're in a social setting.  Service was average. Everyone did his/her job, but it was busy so I felt the servers were rushed and weren't exactly the friendliest. We had few different people drop various items off at our table, and it seemed like everyone was not up to par about food knowledge. The good thing- if the server didn't know, he/she sought the answer and reported back to us.   The restaurant itself was really nice. They do have a bar and outdoor seating. They serve beers, cocktails, wine. Facilities seem to be well-maintained. I anticipate coming back here again! It's a really great concept restaurant, located in a very cool part of Gilbert."}
{"text":"This stake just melted in my mouth! We came here as a family with 9 people! You cook your own stake on a hot stone. It is an experience and delicious!! For a family night or a date night it is wonderful!"}
{"text":"I guess if yoy want to pay$50 for a filet mignon for the novelty of having a steak cooked on on rock this is the place for you. The place was super smokey and the booth bench seat I sat on has worn out springs that was uncomfortable. We had to wait almost an hour for the uncomfortable seat and another hour before we got our food. I never recieved my side dish after being given lip service that it was on the way, no one returned to the table after that until I was done eating. They do have some very reasonably priced items and what we ate was decent."}
{"text":"We had dinner here the first Saturday in February 2016.  We started with the pulled pork sliders, which were ok. Nothing special. Entrees were Tri Tip, steak lava bowl, and some \"beef bits\" for granny. While the concept is intriguing the end results weren't.   To start with, the meat is pre-smoked to about medium rare, so by the time it gets to your table sizzling on the stone about the best you can hope for is Medium my the time the meat warms up. The cuts of meat weren't over fatty or gristly, but all three dishes were tough, tough, tough!  The beef needs to be aged much more for the preparation methods.   Service was pretty bad- our waitress only showed up once after someone else delivered the food to drop off the check. We were told a lot of staff was out with the flu, so that may not be a problem often.   Sides: sweet potato fries, well liked by 2 of us. Garlic mashed potatoes, not very garlicky and tepid temperature. House naked beans - nothing special there either.   Dessert- key lime pie that was more like a cereal bar with lime cheesecake frosting.  Terrible.  The view was great! We were in the booths across the room from the Windows but had a nice view and enjoyed the sunset.  We probably won't be back.  Flavored were ok but the meat was just way too tough to enjoy dining there."}
{"text":"Ok, so first of all, some of you are way too selective in your beautiful photos on the reviews.  My wife and I took friends here because it looked like an amazing place in the pics and reviews.  Well, the food was pretty good, but not fantastic. The steak prep is unique and well done - served on a hot stone.  The salad bar is just ok and general layout of the restaurant makes it feel a bit more cafeteria-ish, like a Denny's.  The interior definitely needs an update to feel like something special.  I would probably go again, but not when I want to take friends or family somewhere really nice.  Maybe ok as a mid-range steakhouse, but that's it. Prices are fair for the food and dining experience."}
{"text":"LOVE IT! nice people, great food!  Our server Linda was a sweetie pie!  GO HERE! They brang the steak in a hit stone and let us cook it ourself. It was awesome!"}
{"text":"First time dining at this establishment.  My wife and I had a great meal. Enjoyed finishing our steak on the 500 degree lava stone.  Great service by the entire staff.  Particularly our server,  Brittney.  We'll definitely return.  The happy hour specials looked great."}
{"text":"What a great meal & fun atmosphere! The steak was absolutely DELICIOUS, cooked exactly the way I wanted ;)  it's so fun to see the airplanes landing right outside the windows of the restaurant."}
{"text":"First time at Steak and Stone. Enjoyed our experience. The guys had sirloin and said it was tender. You can grill to your liking. One gal had shrimp and grilled it on a Stone also. Fun fun. The other gal had the spicy shrimp bowl and said it was also good. Stephanie was our waitress and was knowledgeable regarding what to do for our first time. Plan to return."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The atmosphere is so inviting and it smells good when you first walk in. The food was awesome and the experience was fun! There were 6 of us and we each tried what others had ordered and everything was good right down to the bourbon glaze and BBQ sauce. Would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Had the medallions and garlic mashed potatoes. Grant (Ulysses) was the best bartender/server ever! Very attentive, knew all our names and drinks, recommended which steak for each of our specific tastes, and just plain made it an enjoyable night. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  Best steak I've ever had!  They bring your steak out served on a really hot lava rock and you cook it to your liking right there. They place sea salt on the rock before bringing it out and have an arrangement of dipping sauces if you'd like. Crazy how something so simple would taste so incredible!  The rock stays hot for a long time so you can make sure the steak is cooked just how you like it."}
{"text":"R had purchased a Groupon for when her friends were out for spring training. It did not get used so she was kind enough to invite me to share. Because it wasn't good on Friday or Saturday I made the 1-1/2 hour drive out on Thursday after work. I was immediately impressed to find covered parking. We were seated right away. Our waitress ran us through how things worked and answered all our questions. I couldn't make up my mind which beer I wanted so she brought samples. Both of our steaks were good. I was shooting for medium rare but got almost medium.  The salad bar was pretty well stocked. I got garlic mashed potatoes as my hot side. There are other sides that come out of the kitchen. The only real hitch of the night was the meat came out on the rocks well before either of us were done eating our salads and you can't just let it sit there and cook away by itself so we had a mess going on for a while trying to cook and eat salad.  We had a seat to see the runway but I would not suggest it in the late afternoon. Sure, it's a little gimmicky but it was fun. Depending on what you order you can have a nice evening for $40-50pp including tax and tip or you could easily double that."}
{"text":"Nolan was amazing explaining how this all worked. This was the most amazing steak we have ever had. What a great experience to have with the family.  Love this place."}
{"text":"We joined friends(6 total) here for dinner on Sat. April 7th. We started at the Bar where there was 4 people sitting.  There was only one bartender, although very friendly she was a bit slow to respond, I had to grab her attention to get drinks as she was cleaning up. We were seated outside where they had very good entertainment, guitarist was really good.  We were approached by several people asking if we were ok with drinks and one took our order for a appetizer. From this point the service was poor at best. After a long wait what appeared to be manager had to take our order and explained the process, very nice gentleman. The waitress only returned once to ask if we would like additional drinks thru a 90 min meal and was once asked for ice and never returned with any, I went to bar to grab it. Not sure if we had a new waitress or this was typical for this particular restaurant."}
{"text":"Great steaks and service. Cooking your meat on a hot stone was very cool!  The staff was super personable. Our server was Brady, from New Hampshire. We felt like we were the only ones in the restaurant.  The manager checked on us concerned we had waited too long. We were simply enjoying the company and the restaurant.  The honey bread is made daily and was delicious!"}
{"text":"First time here. Service was good however I thought it was over priced for what it was. Salad bar wasn't great....not very many options. There were 4 \"hot\" dishes next to the salad bar that confused me.....one was just mushrooms and onions.....another was (looked like) just Beef broth etc....no explanation??? We're these for the steaks? If so, not everyone getting steaks go salad bar....like I said.....confusing.  Steaks were good but seemed like a lot of work and the stones you cook on took up a lot of room on the table. They had live music in the bar that was good however it was too loud. Music started just before we got our steaks. It was hard to here our server speak to give us instructions on how to cook our steaks and/or any dinner conversation. All in all it was interesting/different but expensive. 3 people, 3-16oz. ribeyes, 4 cocktails ($2.50 happy hour) was $160. Probably won't go back but it was a little fun."}
{"text":"This was one of those \"I wish I could have that decision back\" experiences. I'll start by saying that we just went for burgers, so we didn't have the stone experience and maybe that makes the place. The service was so scattered. Took ages to get water. The burgers were.. odd? I don't even know how to describe. Not good. I ordered medium and it was very well done. Not much flavor. The bun is way to big/thick for the size of the burger and is very bland. They forgot tomato and french fries for one of us, ranch dressing for the other. There's A LOT of staff running around, yet we did a lot of waiting and chasing after. Actually my husband went and got my ranch dressing from the salad bar. Finally, though the wooden chairs outside look neat, they are seriously uncomfortable! I mostly give credit for being clean and friendly. But we wont be back."}
{"text":"This is our second trip to this restaurant during happy hour because it is AMAZING!!   $1.50 (yes, $1.50 well drinks) and $3 domestic pints and a one trip to the delicious salad bar + soup for $10 (off the regular menu)  Beautiful bar area and excellent service from Grant!  This is our new spot to hit up for movie night at Gilbert Regal.   All day happy hour for the entire month of March!   Giddy-up!"}
{"text":"This place was fine,  I enjoyed it, but it could have been so much more.   the ambience Was really low end. Denny's like.   for having a nice restaurant overlooking the airport they really need to dress it up.  A similar one in Denver is called the \"perfect Landing\".  .... white table cloths , nice bar area.... piano player.   the inside of this place looked more like a Taco Bell   but the food was fine,  big ribs, waitress was nice . location was good."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best steaks you can get! The steaks are fresh and never frozen so you know its going to be a great cut of meat. On too of that, the experience to cook your own meat on a 500 degree rock is pretty awesome.   We also had some great service where everyone was friendly and attentive the entire time. I will come back and enjoy another experience here soon!"}
{"text":"This is not just your average steakhouse, Steak and Stone is an experience. I came with a group of 8 and we were seated right away.  The waitresses (one was in training) were very attentive and took our drink orders right away and explained the concept of the restaurant. We all ordered and went to enjoy the large selection from the salad bar.  As soon as we were finishing up the salads, our steaks and stones had arrived and we were given a very nice, friendly and detailed description of how to cook them.  The meat was amazing.  We are Iowa beef farmers so we are very picky, and from previous reviews I had some concern; but I had the steak bites, cooked them to a nice medium and they were amazing.  Not tough, no fat at all.  The sides were good as well.  My husband and I chose two different sides so we could share. He had the sweet creamy corn, which was to die for. I had the garlic mashed potatoes which tasted good as well. With the clean atmosphere, great entertainment watching planes taking off and landing, the amazing food and great staff the only disappointment we have is that we didn't find this place sooner!"}
{"text":"The food was superb, the service was great, but the salad bar was too pricey for the choices given. The lack of selections made us regret buying the \"endless selection.\"  Our server Mike made the experience enjoyable while being very informative and providing excellent customer service. Jake brought out our steaks and made sure to give us tips on his favorite ways to prepare them. They made sure to make the experience enjoyable and memorable.  Wrblook forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Although I enjoyed being able to cook the food myself, they suggest you cut the steak to cook it faster and you lose a lot of flavor. The sides were mediocre at best. The staff and service did great though!"}
{"text":"LOVED IT! Your steak is pre-smoked to rare, then served to you on a stone, and you take it from there.... Great flavor! Great concept! Prices were soft, which we all enjoy.... House wine by the glass was only 6$.... And tasty.... The place was super busy for a Tuesday night, and the staff was working well together.... Even the owner, David, was acting as Maitre D' and food runner.... The staff was friendly.... The overall experience definitely merits 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"This establishment is a cut above! Steak & Stone is definitely going to be one of our \"go to\" restaurants in the Mesa area. Steaks were cut and we prepared them to our preference. The sides that we selected were garlic mash and sautéed mushrooms. There's a fabulous view of the airstrip and points beyond."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the place was nice it looked clean and well kept. The hostess was a bit rude and disorganized sat a couple who came in after us. The food was good our waitress was very attentive and sweet. She kept our waters full. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant! Fabulous food, cocktails, and service. Great and friendly waite staff/bartenders. Loved cooking on the hot stones and sampling some of the fun and unique mixologist drinks!"}
{"text":"GOOD FOOD - POOR SERVICE  I tried this place for lunch with a group of 7 today and unfortunately didn't have the awesome experience other reviewers seem to have had.   1) We arrived at 11, but the restaurant was still not open. After waiting for 10 minutes, we were the first patrons inside.   2) Despite the server having a tablet to take our orders on, half of the table received incorrect orders or had missing items. By the time 2 of our party received their meals, the rest of us were already finished. The server never offered any of us bourbon glaze, the bread and honey butter that was supposed to come with some of our meals, nor were any of our steaks stamped with the signature \"SS\" that looks so cool in the photos online.   3) Drinks were not refilled a single time during our visit. Not once.   4) What should have been a 45 minute meal (TOPS) turned into a 1 hr and 15 minute ordeal.   5) The restaurant doesnt seem to have adequate ventilation for their \"cook your own meat at your table\" business model. With only a few of us in the building, the dining room quickly filled with smoke. So fair warning, your eyes will burn and your clothes will smell like smoke all day.  That said, the food we did receive was very good, but the extremely poor service made it hard to enjoy. I'll try it out again in a month to see if they've made any improvements.  3 / 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great meal and fantastic wait staff. Very pleasant and a great smile.  Had the lunch buffet, love the soup."}
{"text":"Very cool idea, they cook the steak right in front of you on a hot stone. I would probably only give 3 stars for the taste, but i decided to give 4 stars since it looks cool."}
{"text":"This place is a great dining experience! We tend to come here for special occasions and always enjoy it. The steaks are great and the addition of shrimp is great. I loved the addition of the salad and bar and the hot bar. It's always fun to find a great experience when dining not just good food.   Service was great, never an empty glass and they were helpful in clearing out the table quickly.   Please don't paint over the airplanes!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was an outstanding meal experience in every way. Although the service was slow, the restaurant was packed and when we asked about our order, the co-owner came over.  He apologized, joked that we were probably wondering why it took so long to get raw meat to the table, then explained that they had to heat the rocks to an appropriately high heat. When the food came, it was amazing. My companions ordered the filet mignon tips and the 16-oz prime rib, which was smoked and rare when it arrived at the table. She was given a stone to cook her meat to the desired level of done-ness and the smoke gave it an amazing flavor. I ordered the unlimited salad bar, but instead, I recommend ordering your favorite cut of meat. The owner checked in on us while we were eating our dinners and then said he was going to send over two desserts -- the peach cobbler and warm brownie, both covered in vanilla ice cream. The cobbler was made with fresh peaches and it was fantastic."}
{"text":"The food was very good but the service was seriously lacking. The employees were nice but incompetent. We were not given a drink menu, not offered water, had to ask for simple things like steak knives (at a steak restaurant). The hostess seemed annoyed by us. The bus boy took our plates while we were in the middle of eating, the waitress never checked in to see if we wanted another drink. Fortunately the food was good (we got the filet and ribeye and Mac and cheese) and the concept of seasoning and cooking the steak yourself was pretty cool, but for a pretty pricey dinner we would have liked a better experience."}
{"text":"We came in for lunch on a Sunday afternoon around 2pm. They are clearly a little short staffed...but...the food is great! It's almost a little Fred Flintstone like, cooking meat on a stone. The house steak, which was the most tender sirloin I've ever had. It was fun to relax and just watch the meat cook. The salad bar was fresh, delicious bleu cheese dressing. I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Service was awesome. Food is great! Atmosphere is fabulous. I am stuffed and for sure will be back!"}
{"text":"Very nice step up. Nice atmosphere, clean, nicely lit, very awesome and attentive staff. Do yourself a favor, bring some friends and/or loved ones to this awesome venue and get closer.  Jenae was our server. She's ninja-level and she's just the right mix of everything. You should def feel fortunate if she greets you at your table.  I've been to a similar place in Philly. However, Steak and Stone exceeded expectations.   I had the Tri-Tip AYCE. It included the salad and baked-potato bars. I really left happy. And really, in life, isn't that all you're after? Man!, that smoked Tri-Tip was delicious. And Jenae brought an amazing sauce/glaze, as well as butter, to add to my Stone-cooking experience. I also got a skewer of 5 nicely-sized shrimp. Tasty... I credit the cook, bald, ugly, but truly good at what he does. :)  This place is an experience. In all seriousness, don't miss out. It's an opportunity to spend some extra time with the people you love to have some relaxed conversation over the fun activities involved in the dinner.  This is that ice-breaker venue you've been looking for: for the kids, the coworkers, the employee or boss...whoever. It's even possible Steak and Stone can assist you in cajoling that Brother-In-Law who owes you money to finally cough it up. Yeah, I know, it's more likely he'll stiff you on the meal. But I digress. ANYWAY!, S&S is a tasty distraction and pure awesomeness that will thaw all.  Go! Be happy. Absolutely ZERO chance you'll regret it.  Tell them Crangious McBasketball sent ya... not my name, but it will be fun saying it.  PS  Crangious McBasketball reference is from Sal of Impractical Jokers. Too Funny."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a late lunch with my wife at this restaurant.  Hot lava stone cooking the meat at your table is fantastic; creating great aroma and flavor.  My wife enjoyed the \"Steak Bites\" and I had the 3 meat platter.  Good salad/ soup bar too. Our server Casey     was friendly, attentive and helpful. Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"Stellar concept originally brought to this fine city of Mesa by the two Daves. Service was beyond exceptional, especially Rachel, who treated me like a VIP. Steak with the bourbon glaze was phenomenal. Feel like a better person walking out of this place"}
{"text":"I would give them a negative review if I could. My experience didn't even rate 1 star. Cold place. Overpriced food. Unresponsive service and all around bad experience. Save your money and try another restaurant."}
{"text":"We went here last week on a double date. It was okay, and the steak was so so.  We seemed to have a difficult time with the stone staying hot.  They had to bring us out a new one a few times.  The salad bar was pretty decent, yet did not include the potatoes.  You had to purchase that separately.  I would consider coming back.  We had a fun time, but the food was only decent in my opinion for the cost."}
{"text":"Found the restaurant online looked like a cool concept the steaks were spot on tender and delicious creamed corn was tasty as was the baked potato also had the lava cake another winner try it you will like it. The owners were on the floor engaging customers making sure food was to their satisfaction ."}
{"text":"MEDIOCRITY AT IT'S NOT SO FINEST  After seeing multiple advertisements on Facebook, we finally decided to give it a try today.   Walking up to the front door, off to the right there was a very nice looking outdoor patio for dining. Was just over 90° today so we decided to go inside.  The inside was very nice. Lots of wood accents. Nice wooden tables and benches, comfy chairs, blah blah blah. I ordered the house special steak and salad bar.  The salad bar had it's usually choices. The bleu cheese had no chunks of bleu cheese at all, and was very runny. My wife's Italian dressing was super thick.  Our server, a very nice lady whose name escapes me, brought out the hot stone on a large metal tray atop a metal base. The presentation was very cool. I'm a salt and pepper fan on my steak only. If it needs glazes and/or marinades it's not even worth it to me. My side was Mac and cheese. The steak was not good. Tough and had a funny texture to it. I actually ended up throwing it back on the stone and adding a little of their bourbon glaze. Didn't help. The Mac and cheese was cold! I put the cup directly on the hot stone to heat it up. On the second trip to the table our server then asked if she could heat it up for me. Not wanting it to be microwaved I declined and left it on the stone until it reached \"warm enough\" to eat temperature.  The only thing that saved this review from a one star rating was our server, and the decor and cleanliness of the restaurant.   Disappointed. Will not be returning for a second visit."}
{"text":"Really interesting place! Definitely cool for a date night! The steaks come raw on a 500 degree stone. Cool!!!!!! You choose your rub and cook your meal yourself. My bf really enjoyed his cut and taste of his steak.   I got the fajita bowl with tortillas. Spicy kick but really yummy and an exciting way to eat fajitas. Mine came in a stone bowl as well. Dangerous, but awesome. Lol!   I took one star away because of how long we waited when it was extremely empty. Also, we were sat next to the kitchen and could hear everything the waiters/cooks were saying. We heard about the scheduling and employee drama and even heard them talking about heating my brownie dessert up in the microwave... thanks chef mic! Haha. Just not the most professional to hear swear words and the music the cooks are listening to. I didn't mind too much, but just something for the establishment to consider?   All in all, I would definitely recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is sharp and fun.  Great ambience, great music and great service.  The only thing is that not everybody likes to cook when they go out to eat.  That said, I cooked up the yummiest steak on that hot rock and it was worth every cent."}
{"text":"I had the smoked Tri Tip and The husband had the 10 oz. sirloin, which looked more like 16 oz. They come out about 10% cooked on a blazing hot lava stone and you cook it the rest of the way to the way you like it. I cooked mine about 90 seconds on each side and it was perfect medium.  You get a trip to the salad bar, a small loaf of bread and one item from the hot bar. Salad was delicious. Try the curried rice salad when you go.  Service was good. They have plenty of people working there and they explain everything well. Very reasonably priced for all you get. There was a Groupon offered but sold out by the time we tried to get it. We will definitely go back when we want a good steak and I don't want to cook at home."}
{"text":"Great concept but lacking. Our waitress and the staff were awesome but the food was just okay. The steak was good but sides and bread weren't. My husband said it was \"cafeteria food\".  The tiles in the women's bathroom were green but have been colored with a black permanent marker & not all of them are colored in. I really wanted to like this place as it is a cool concept and has great potential, but it definitely could use some help."}
{"text":"The steak is absolutely awesome! Service is great! Owner is a cool dude  Would highly recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"As you may have read, Steak & Stone is in the former Anzio's Landing. The building is much the same. To the west of the entry is a brewing company.  Upon entry, the reception/hostess area is cute, with the \"how to\" of the Steak & Stone experience on the wall, and what cuts are where on the animal. The hostess was nice enough...In a gruff way, if that makes sense.  Our party of four is led to a table by the window. It was a nice runway view, nice for our out-of-town visitors. This is where the ambience ended. Our waitress was nice enough, but not very attentive and detail-oriented.  Our drinks came quickly. The others enjoyed their beer and bloody marys. My peach martini was nasty. Our waters were only filled once, at the very end of the meal.  The prices were high for what you receive. The salad bar didn't have much on it - a few salads, wilted mesclun and some toppings. The \"hot bar\" of sides was empty! At 630pm no less! There were only bourbon beans, a discolored arrangement of boiled vegetables, and two soups. Out of baked potato, out of sweet potato...Out of everything. We were also never given a bread board that I noticed on so many other tables.  I had the 6oz filet mignon. The meat was tender and had a wonderful flavor. I also enjoyed the bourbon glaze. Speaking of, we had a gal that brought out meat, who was separate from the waitress. This girl was ghetto. She talked about her tattoos and paid no attention to what she was doing. We hadn't asked about her tattoos, by the way. You're not the first on the planet to have one. She said that she would bring us the bourbon glaze, but never game back. I later mentioned it to our server, and she brought some. But, I digress. My meat was good. Not 30 bucks good, but good nonetheless. My husband and SIL had sirloin and shrimp, my brother sirloin and ribs. They enjoyed their meal. I should also mention that our Yelp check-in gave us an appetizer. We got the smoked chicken nachos, which were great. Our app came at the same time as our meal, which was poorly maneuvered.  All in all, this was a fairly good meal, but there is no attention to service and detail here, and the staff has no gauge on timing and amounts of food prep for the time of day. I have read other reviews, and though the managerial responses have sounded promising, it seems that no changes have been instituted."}
{"text":"Although the staff was pleasant, the food was mediocre at best.  Salad bar (included with most steaks) was pretty average.  I had a baked potato as my other side and it was a typical, foil-wrapped \"cafeteria\" potato. Nothing to get excited about.  The biggest disappointment was the rib-eye steak I ordered and the New York strip my partner had.  Neither one was cooking, even after 10+ minutes on the stone.  Our waitress suggested slicing the steak into small strips and cooking each piece by itself.  Still didn't help.  We sent the NY strip back to the kitchen to be cooked on the grill and I receive a second hot stone.  While it did a better job cooking than the first, it was still a long, slow process of cooking one mouthful at a time.  On top of everything else, my rib eye was very gristly (not fatty) and wasn't the best I've had.    Given the so-so quality of the food and the fact that you have to cook your own steak, the prices are outrageously high. I'd rather pay the same (or lower) prices at the Keg, Ruth's Chris, etc. and have someone else do the work.  I don't think the \"gimmick\" of cooking on hot stones at the table will be enough to keep this place afloat unless the prices drop significantly."}
{"text":"OK. Timing is everything....Perfect weather, dining Al fresco watching planes while sipping on cocktails. Waitress, in fact, everyone from the moment we entered to exit, superb. Last but not least, the food, WOW! Rob is from KC and the RIBS THE BEST EVER! You have to have the corn and beans side dishes. A MUST! We also ordered the meat, cheese appetizer platter. Not disappointed. So much food, top quality, served perfectly. You MUST visit! If we didn't live in Prescott, we'd visit more often. So you must visit for us. Try it, you'll LOVE it, too!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a super yummy streak house and a fun atmosphere, look no further! They will serve you steak on a 500 degree stone and let you cook it to your own delight! Literally!  The waiter, very kind and helpful. His name was Phillip, we appreciated his looks as well. Haha on another note, their manager Jenna is great too! She was always keeping in check with us and making sure we had waters topped, and hot stones!  Speaking of, Jacksons stone went cold and we asked her for another one, and she was vvvery prompt in getting us one! So nice of a manger to do so. Thanks Jenna.  We had a great time and personally I can't wait to be back in AZ to have some tender yummy streak!"}
{"text":"Our server Brady was excellent. she was very friendly and attentive. We were in a salad mood so both got salad bar. Good selection on salad bar and 3 soups included we were too full to try but looked good. We split a prime rib dip. Maybe a bit pricey but was good. Next time we will do the steak cooked on the stone. Ambience is upscale and nice"}
{"text":"So disappointedTrying to find a fun place for Christmas eve dinner for a party of 10. This sounded like a really interesting, fun, different concept.  They don't take reservations! I get not doing it on a regular basis but for the holidays... I really think they should consider offering a reservation option to provide better customer service! Maybe we'll get around to trying them at a different time when it's not so important to not be waiting around to be seated"}
{"text":"Stopped by here together my friend. I never been into this place and was really happy he introduce this place to me, thanks bro. Great place to eat with a special hook: finish cooking your steak right at the table on a 500 degree rock slab. Check it out and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"It's like Golden Corral but you have to cook your own food and it's twice the price. Service was ok and the quality of food poor."}
{"text":"Steak and Stone is a restaurant that not many know about, and that needs a lot more love and attention! I'll break it down in a couple of different categories.  Decor: This restaurant is located right next to the airport, and Boeing. It's located right next to a brewery, which is a nice touch for those who are looking for a draft before the food. Inside, the place is a little small, but does have a larger banquet room for parties if needed.  Food: This restaurant has an amazingly simple, yet fun concept. You order a certain style of cut and thickness. They bring it out on a screaming hot stone, and give you the control to cook to your hearts desire. I ordered the Smoke Prime Rib, which was absolutely amazing. Every entree comes with unlimited salad bar. Some people don't appreciate a salad bar, they seem to think it's tacky, I love it!  Service: The waiter we had was one of the nicest, informative, and relaxed servers I've ever met. He broke down the how to's on how to cook the meat, how to cut across the grain, and everything in between. I really appreciated everything that this restaurant does, and I will be returning.  Overall: This restaurant is really something special. If you're looking for a steak house that does have some other options, this is the place. If you don't want to cook it yourself, you are able to have the kitchen cook it for you. Just know that it will take an additional 20 minutes."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time and had mixed reviews. The restaurant's decor was lacking; not at all what you would expect for a place with such high prices. The seat of my chair was covered in what appeared to be noodles; when I mentioned this to the hostess she just laughed and said, \"oh no, that's just cheese\", and left me to brush it off myself. The customers were from all walks of life. Literally any type of attire would have been acceptable. The very nice waitress immediately brought some cold rolls (which were sweet and dry) with apple butter. The salad bar contents were fresh, but included nothing special. Just your standard items with a couple of prepackaged pastas, potato salad, tapioca, etc.  After observing the other customers, we decided we didn't want to have to cook our own meat and eat it off a huge, hot rock, so we ordered a philly and the lava bowl. The philly was so-so, too salty and mostly bun... but the lava bowl was fabulous - very spicy and plentiful. However, in our opinions neither meal was worth their high price. When we mentioned a birthday, the very nice waitress served a huge, complimentary piece of bread pudding with ice cream, and proceeded to belt out a hilariously passionate version of 'Happy Birthday'. She was awesome! The bread pudding was blah. Overall, it was an OK experience but we probably won't go back because there are plenty of classier steak joints that serve warm bread, have exceptional salad bars and employ chefs who will cook your steak to perfection for comparable prices. This is a place you go for the novelty of cooking your own steak on a hot rock, which just didn't appeal to us."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the dinner. Our server was pleasant & the entire staff was attentive. We had Tri-Tip & Filet Medallions with backed potatoes. Both were delicious. The price includes the experience, not just the meal. A couple restaurant modifications I would suggest; because the restaurant has a unique \"stone cooking\" theme- the atmosphere should accompany the experience- a little more quaint or romantic would compliment the experience & though the music was appropriate, it could've been less overbearing. I would also suggest some sauces other than from a bottle, like a butter Merlot perhaps. Overall, we enjoyed our date night and recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a unique place to celebrate our five year anniversary. The wait staff was so attentive and friendly. The food was incredible and the experience was a lot of fun. Our waitress took extra care of us making sure that we were offered a free desert in honor of our special day.  We cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went last night for the first time and it was amazing! The homemade bread,beans, baked potato, and rib eye were phenomenal! We loved the experience of cooking our own steak just how we like it. We will be eating there often! Definitely recommend to anyone who loves a good steak and a fun dining experience."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! The food is amazing and the staff is extremely friendly. The dining experience is unique with you cooking your food on a hot stone. We love it and have eaten here numerous times."}
{"text":"Took a little long to get our steak and stone but otherwise it was a cool experience to cook your own steak right at the table! Enjoyed the simplicity of the restaurant and our waitress was sweet."}
{"text":"Cool concept!  Quality food and good prices!  Highly recommend this place.  Filet was very tender! The service was outstanding.  Will definitely make this a regular stop!"}
{"text":"Great Steak Restaurant. Kristi was very helpful made our visit a pleasant one! Quiet place to grab lunch and get some work done!"}
{"text":"Great experience, really good meat. Good service. Beer from microbrewery next door is very tasty."}
{"text":"First time cooking a steak on a lava stone.  Awesome experience - steak was great especially with the bourbon glaze Mike recommended!  Will definitely come back.  Great place to enjoy with friends"}
{"text":"Excellent cuts of meat. My filet was tender and very flavorful. The bourbon glade was a nice touch. But I didn't need it because the steak tasted great as is. Super friendly service and the owner was nice enough to stop by each table to check on the meal of everyone here. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best restaurant ever! Love cooking my own steak and it's especially great on the stone! This place is wonderful, I could come here every day, and it's very fairly priced! Sitting on the patio is the best"}
{"text":"Was excited to see a new restaurant in the area and was more intrigued that I would get to prepare my own steak. The New York was very good and preparing it on the stone they bring to your table was easy. She had the filet and was able to cook it almost per bite. Definitely coming here again!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food.. my favorite steakhouse.  The steak is so tender and cooks within minutes on the hot stone"}
{"text":"Great lunch for 7 of us.  Love the wall of windows!  Steak and chicken cooked on the stone were the best!  Will be back."}
{"text":"this is the incredible awesome delicious restaurant not only is there food great at the staff the waiters waitress or incredibly nice my husband and I love going here on date nights"}
{"text":"Very fast, nice atmosphere,great workers. 11/10 would recommend. Really good food and hot stones"}
{"text":"We had been here about a year ago. We weren't very impressed with most of the food, but it was pretty new and the steak was amazing--so amazing that we wanted to give them another chance, hoping they'd made some improvements on the side dishes. We decided to go for our Father's Day dinner. I called ahead and we were seated within a few minutes.  We waited over an hour for our meal. Our booth was next to the kitchen and kept vibrating from the kitchen crew banging something loudly. It actually knocked over a menu that was standing up on the table. I am still trying to figure out what took so long. We got our salads from the mediocre salad bar, and when we got our \"meals,\" they were literally raw steaks on a hot stone with small plates on the side. We had to get our sides from the hot bar, which ran out of the garlic mashed potatoes and wasn't refilled for about 15 minutes.  The steaks were very good again, and the manager apologized for our wait (on her own--we didn't complain). She took off the most expensive meal, which we appreciated.  Overall, though, if I'm spending over $100 for 3 people, I'd prefer not to have to get my own salad and sides, as well as cook my own steak. I'm disappointed that the changes they made since the last time weren't for the better, because it's a fun concept and the steaks were good. But we won't be going back."}
{"text":"The service was slow and they brought a bad cut of meat. We ordered a 16oz ribeye to share. They brought a 12oz. Then the stone was not very hot it was taking forever to cook. They finally brought a hotter stone. I cooked our steak to medium rare and it was tough. This place is overpriced to cook your own food.  In addition it was not clean. Their women's bathroom was nasty, I've been on truck stops with a better bathroom.  The menus were dirty, the salt and pepper shakers were sticky.  We won't be back, I cannot recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great experience. Awesome service. Reasonable pricing for food and drinks. The Carmel glaze is a great addition to the steak. Rachel was the best server ever. She loves Moscow mules. 10/10 Would bang"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!! My wife and I came here for our anniversary last night and we will definitely be coming back.   I ordered the 16oz Sirloin and wow, the cut of the meat was delicious! Such a thick cut I was shocked! The bourbon sauce I used as a glaze as suggested by our waitress.   My wife had a steak and shrimp lava bowl which was tasty as well. We shared both together and give each 5 stars (6 stars if we could).   We went at 5pm and got lucky with happy hour for drinks. I had an old fashioned which was made just right. The liquor prices shocked me, so cheap compared to any steak house I know.   My only suggestion is a drink menu. There was a wine list, but no bar menu. I think this would generate a lot more liquor sales."}
{"text":"WOW! Such good food, worth waiting for. We got seated right away but after ordering it took some time or either it felt like it cause I was very hungry! The dining room can get quite a bit smoky at times, and can over take you. But it doesn't linger. We did get bread while we were waiting for meal. Then the BIG SHOW yes our meal! They give you a tutorial on how to cook your steak it was good, I had filet and my husband had the ribeye. we also ordered the smoked combo meat plate, boy..... it taste like Texas! Ummm ummm good. I will be back. Awesome!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place because I enjoyed the original location in Mesa! This one was not as good to me. Not enough staff and hot bar was cold. Too much money for the food that was available for us. I won't be back to this location. I gave 2 stars because the waitress we had was the only one and she was good. Also my sirloin steak was tender!"}
{"text":"I love this place!    The service was great; our server, Kimberly, was very helpful, friendly and just plain sweet!  The steaks are always fantastic, and I love cooking my own steak the way I want it, and it's always hot!   I can speak for the sirloin steak- - thats the one I usually order.  The salad bar was fresh, not a huge variety, but good!   Love their peach cobbler dessert too!   Another side benefit is watching all the air traffic at Falcon Field right next door.    I give them 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Worst experience !!! Don't waste your money!! My whole family (party of 7) was excited to try this whole sizzling stone steak experience so we went last night. Sadly very disappointed. They were busy but that is no excuse for little to absolutely no service at all. Took over 30 min to even get our order in and when we did there was no help or explanation on the process at all... such as seasonings or sauces.. nothing!!! Then our order arrives and only one of the stones where hot enough to cook the steaks. Had to ask several times to fix and in the end only one got traded out so we all shared trying to cook our unseasoned meat. The seasoning he dropped at the table came after the whole stone trade out again no help in the process....awful!  My youngest ordered chicken fingers which came out looking burnt and for an 8yr old that means they will not eat it ... when I asked the server he said that was the special breading and walked away. Not one person checked on our table the rest of the meal... I sat there for almost two hours with nothing to drink ... the sever didn't refill our tea and cokes !! Crazy!!  Awful from start to finish and will be passing on how awful our experience was to family and friends!!!  Don't waste the money and for 7 it was not cheap!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends because they had a gift card, was pleasantly surprised based on previous reviews. We were seated promptly by our waitress Brady, who was a delight and answered all our questions regarding the menu (which seemed confusing at first). After ordering we all went up to the all-you-can-eat salad bar, which looked and tasted fresh and not like most grimy salad bars. Once we finished the salads, our steaks on stones were served piping hot with lots of flavor (especially after adding their bourbon sauce to the stone). If you are hangry like me, order the salad bar/all-you-can-eat sides combo that way you can sample all the sides. The cream corn side was the best! Prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get, and don't forget to make sure to write a review on yelp for the free dessert!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Love the rustic decor and view of Falcon Field. Salad bar was fresh and tasty. We ordered the ribeye and steak pieces. Steak was very tender and juicy and you have complete control over how well it is done. Sides were excellent. Server, Nolan, was very friendly and knowledgeable. He also recommended the perfect wine. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place for lunch. Just opened on Falcon Field where Anzio's used to be. You get a steak on a hot rock and can cook it yourself. The food is delicious and I always bring home a doggie bag. It's nice to have another option on the airport again."}
{"text":"Now can you guess why they have really good reviews? There prices are a bit overpriced and you have to cook your own steak. They do have nice parking though"}
{"text":"Amazing and fun way to enjoy your lunch & dinner. Definitely different! Staff is really friendly! Salad bar is really fresh. Great atmosphere and loving the rustic style of the place!!"}
{"text":"This was a delightful surprise. I don't get to this side of town often and looking for somewhere different to take our friends from Texas. We loved the idea of cooking  meats from a hot rock.   This is a high-energy restaurant - this staff hustles.  It was a very busy Saturday night, and there were a few timing issues but anything we brought to the attention of the team was taken care of right away.   My husband ordered the rib eye and I ordered the prime rib.   Wow. Both delicious and we we cooked our meat to our liking. We were having a leisurely meal, so they brought out a fresh hot rock for us to keep things warmed up.   Decent salad staples - and some great options on the hot bar.  Tip: check in on Yelp for a free appetizer.  We had the zucchini which was nicely done. Btw - skip the offer of the bourbon glaze.  We just tried it on a small piece and it was too much. But someone at the next table was really raving about it.  So - your choice !   What made the evening was the staff. If you go, ask for Brady. She's witty, knows her stuff and makes sure you are taken care of!   If we could offer one tip - our friends ordered domestic beer and a cold glass. Both the beer and the glasses could have been a lot colder. We are coming into the season where our frosty beverages need to be frosty!   It's not inexpensive but the food was good and the experience was great.  We will be back. PS - if the weather is nice, ask for the patio. You can be right with the planes!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Love the look inside."}
{"text":"This is a fry it yourself steak place in Mesa. Interesting concept but the execution is lacking. The server places big chunk of steel holding a large, very hot rock in front of you on which you cook your own meat. If it is not right, you have no one to blame but your self. I asked for a pepper grinder. I was told there was none by our server. Ground pepper in an overfilled shaker is not the same and anyone who understands seasoning meat understands the difference. I wanted the chance to season my steak before I let it cook much further. Sorry but you can't. BTW, you are given only a steak knife a table knife, and a table fork to eat with. NO spoon, no spatula or tongs to handle the meat on the stone. First time I have every had to turn a 12 ounce steak with the flat edge of a steak knife. The table we sat at was WAY too small for the amount of grills and crockery on it. Especially when you consider the hot rocks and boiling molocate on it. It would have been large enough for 2 persons but not 4. Once my steak was cooked, I no longer had any need for the luke warm rock in front of me. It was just table clutter. A wait staff eventually removed the ring, the steel bowl and rock, but not until I had taken my steak off of the rock and was trying to cut it up on the small cold plate I had been given. Meanwhile, my baked potato was getting cold cuz it was served on a room temp plate.   I found that there was enough temp in the rock to brown the smoked sausage and the roast beef that was part of the appetizer. That was fun and tasty. The appetizer should be served with its own hot rock for just this purpose.  Bigger tables, better tools, at least one pepper grinder for guest use, prompt removal of unused clutter from tables all would enhance the experience. BTW, I was served a steak that failed to resemble any ribeye steak I have ever seen. It was tasty and tender and was probably beef. It was well marbled but had more waste than it should have had."}
{"text":"Very good food and.  Service came here a few times   Cool experience I recommend it to every family"}
{"text":"Now I'll give it 1 star but maybe they deserve 2 stars if I was a retired senior. My wife and I used to come here often and I was very happy with their service but they changed the menu and the prices and keep changing the salad bar rules every time. I don't like when I feel that restaurant manipulate their customers. I used to get \"6oz\" tri tip for $$ 12.99 but They remove to force the customers to get 12oz for $$ 23.99 now!!!!! . Also, you only have a one choice of the bar ( salad or the hot bar ), before you could get both. I'm so pissed that I won't go there unless they bring their old menu back."}
{"text":"First time here and loved it.  Tried the 6 oz filet with the salad bar.  Salad bar includes some hot items so totally worth it. The quality of the meat was great and you can only blame yourself if it's not cooked to your liking. Cooking on a hot stone was cool.  I only had the 6 oz so don't know what it would like with a larger cut.  My filet was delish.  Great for families.  Very casual. Their March madness happy hour that lasts all day is a steal. I may live here this month. Grant was also great!!  He showed me how to cook the steak but basically cooked it for me. :-)"}
{"text":"wow.really amazed  how.it.was .. I will for sure come back our server TONY was on point !!"}
{"text":"Steak restaurant with a twist on how you get you steak cooked.   Five or six steak cuts listed on menu, cut to weight, placed on a preheated vocanic stone and delivered to your table for you to finish cooking to your desired level of doneness. Two thumbs up. Can't blame the kitchen for your steak being too rare or more like jerky than your ideal well done piece o'meat. LMAO!  YOU might need some grilling skills. Most entrees come with one side dish option and the salad bar. Wine list is limited but the selection is decent. Salad bar took me back to the late 70's and 80's.  It was fairly small and things were unlabeled, including the dressing.  The bacon was fake (similar to Bac-Ohs).  Maybe I should call it bacon impersonation.   Fake bacon should be a violation. Overall the salad bar was acceptable and would have ranked higher if they could have managed to at least label the dressing. Italian French Thousand Island And what is that?  Ranch?  Bleu Cheese?  Creamy Italian? I think you know where I'm coming from now.  The ambience is barn / industrial style.   The concept though, customers grilling their own steak to their liking, is unique.  I dig it.   Cooking the steak I order to my own preference is ideal.  Perfection in the steak grilling, for me, skills department. Gimme a few better wine options, an assortment of microbrews/craft beers (Por*cough*ters) and label that salad bar and I'd be inclined to modify that rating.  Go MEAT!  MEAT!"}
{"text":"The service was great & they seated us right away but the food was not that exciting. If I'm going to pay 100+ for dinner and drinks I want to be amazed. It's a experience so I would recommend giving it a try for yourself."}
{"text":"First time in and really enjoyed it. Thought it was strange at first that I had to cook my own steak but it ended up being really fun and something different. The sirloin was super tender and I added my own seasonings. Mac and cheese was good and very cheesy. Garlic mashed potatoes were good but a little on the dry side. I will plan to return."}
{"text":"My husband & I went during their soft opening and we both ordered the 10oz filet mignon. It was an excellent tender cut of meat and great quality for the price. My husband asked  for a side of garlic salt to use while cooking our steak on the stone which was a good call. The bourbon glaze was outstanding. I had the vegetables and creamed corn (had a hint of pineapple) both were excellent and not the usual. My husband had the baked beans and garlic mashed potatoes and gravy both were good but usual in taste. We highly recommend this restaurant and wish them great success as we love the view of the airstrip and another restaurant choice in the red mountain area.   Recommendations: atmosphere could be cozier inside and the steak knives could be sharper. The fresh brewed ice tea was good but needed larger glasses and some Sweet n Low. Also recommend having garlic salt and maybe some other seasonings available on the table."}
{"text":"So...we went to Steak and Stone for a friend's birthday and there were a LOT of us..we had a huge table for 24.  While I thought the food was very good, I do believe this place is a bit over rated and over priced.  The steak wasn't very well seasoned and I think i have cooked better at home. That being said, the service - for such a huge table - was very good and very friendly."}
{"text":"Absolutely a great steakhouse.  The staff was so friendly and the owner was at every table making sure that every customer had a great dinner experience.  We will be coming back."}
{"text":"The first time yelp reviews have let me down this place is mediocre at best our waiter had no knowledge of the menu food was warm at best the only reason I gave it 2 stars is the young gentleman who served the food was friendly and more than apologetic  stay away from this place"}
{"text":"This place was a gold mine to find. Not from the area and heard about this place from a good friend. The experience was really fun watching your steak cook right in front of you on a rock! The food tasted amazing!! Will go back again this week to take my parents"}
{"text":"I've driven past this place several times when playing golf in Mesa. Told my wife about it and we decided to give it a try. We came on a Thursday evening. We were promptly seated in a booth by the window. Since this was our first time, the server explained everything. I ordered the 10 oz Sirloin Steak, $20 and my wife had the 6 oz Smoked Tri Tip, $13, on a stone. They both came with a trip to the salad bar. The salad bar was okay missing some of my favorite items, i.e. bacon bits, mushrooms, olives, pepperoncini....etc. When the steaks came out, they looked beautiful. Sitting on a 500 degree stone. My sirloin was at least an inch thick. The problem, you had to season the steak yourself and there was only one bottle for seasoning the steak. No other seasoning. The sad part, you cut your steak into at least 1/2 inch slices so that it would cook and add your seasoning.  I prefer to have my whole steak cooked at once and seasoned well. Maybe the next time we visit, we'll bring our own seasoning. Don't know if that'll make a difference. We'll see."}
{"text":"Had a nice time here,  food was good,  salad bar was ok.  Service was fast. They bring your steak out on a very hot stone and the steak is  raw.  So you cut it into pcs and it cooks.  They have seasoning  at the table its a cool idea.  Now can i make a better steak at home  yes. But i cam say that for 90% of the steak places out here.  The  real fun started aftre i finished my steak. Cause the rock stays very hot for a long time. Kids and i had fun  putting cubes on it and seeing how fast they melt.    Put a left over tomato on it watched that cook. A onion.   Place is  fun kids had a good time.   I would go back for that reason."}
{"text":"Everything I ate here was amazing! The ribs are smoked to perfection and just fall off the bone. I don't even care for creamed corn but I tried some and it was fantastic...kind of like dessert like. The salad bar has a great variety and all of it was yum. I would definitely recommend checking out this place. The staff is super friendly too so of course that makes for an overall great experience. Trust me you will not be disappointed. :)"}
{"text":"What a unique awesome restaurant! It's kinda fun to cook your own steak see silly but it was primal and I felt like a cave(wo)man. My waitress was Kim and she was the cutest little thing. Super knowledgeable about the entire menu, explained all the cuts and then when our food was served she reviewed how to cook it, the seasonings, including her recommendations. Couldn't decide on which dessert so we tried all three; Peach Cobbler won out in a code vote with the Bread Pudding. Try to time dinner for sunset. It's beautiful!!!"}
{"text":"We love this place! They know us and they treat us like family. i am completely in love with their salad bar! IT IS AMAZING! Sometimes when we dine there I'll just order the salad bar and my husband will order a steak on a stone. I have to mention the house seasoning really quick. They have it out on every table. Use it, trust me it will make your steak melt like butter in your mouth."}
{"text":"First time at steak and stone and the food was great! Our server Hannah was excellent and food came out extremely fast. It was fun to cook your steak on a stone."}
{"text":"Amazing experience!! I would highly recommend it to anyone!!! Everything was yummmm and mike was an awesome waiter!! loved it all!!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my wife's birthday and really enjoyed the experience. The steaks were excellent and the stones were just the right temp for cooking."}
{"text":"So much fun!!! The New York strip steak was really good.  Ask for the Bourbon glaze for the steak. My kids loved the steak bite, not on the kids menu.  Salad bar was good, had quite a few options and lots of dressing choices.    It was my daughters' birthdays and they sang for them and brought out dessert.  It was a fun time for all.    Staff was very attentive and on top of our needs."}
{"text":"Went back.............wanted to take friends.  It was embarrassing! Ribeye steak was not 16 oz. Then the Sirloin I ordered was so tough I needed someone to hold it while I cut it. We ordered sides and 2 were cold. The salad bar is just sad.........and you pay extra for sides and salad.  Wish this restaurant would have held ifs finesse as it was a very unique idea. We loved taking out of town guest there.  Won't do it again.  Way over priced for having to cook the steak yourself and there are really NO extras even if you pay for them your are not happy with what you get."}
{"text":"First time here and it was fantastic! Atmosphere was on point. Steaks, great! Having the ability to cook your own steak to your desired temp... genius! Have to bring the wife back and have a great double date!"}
{"text":"We stopped to eat here recently. It was a terrible dining experience. It started out with the table being directly in the path of the air conditioning vent. Felt like we were in a wind tunnel. We were told that we would be glad to be sitting after the brought out the stones because it would heat the area up. The food was overpriced and not worth the effort of cooking it on the stone. The salad bar was ok. The baked potato was OK. The mashed potatoes was lumpy and startchy. The sweet potatoes were woody and flavorless. The vegetables were awful and not edible. They had to bring out another stone because the chicken was not cooking adequately."}
{"text":"So the family and I stopped in here for lunch yesterday, excited to try them out. I had experienced this idea during a tour with the military in Europe, at a restaurant in Luxembourg City called \"Stones\".  One of the best dining experiences of my life. I was eager to recreate the experience.  By comparison, the basic idea is sound, but implemented differently.  I would suggest that S and S change a few things.  Add some more sauces to the fare, the sauce you offer is tasty, but adding some butter-based, and maybe garlic sauces would be nice and give patrons a choice.  Also, the presentation of the big steel pan is interesting, and I can see that they have even been cut down so to be less imposing, but they still feel huge and cumbersome.  If I remember correctly, the ones from my previous experience had the stone milled to size and polished, all combined in a tray that also held the sauces.  Very tidy, and convenient for the servers to handle. I felt bad for our server, as she clearly struggled to handle serving these things.  It was obvious that this place is new.  The process is not yet refined.  Other than the steak that we cooked ourselves, everything else was colder then expected. Veggies, and sides were not hot.  Even the peach cobbler, which would have been incredible, was unheated.  I look forward to the maturing of this restaurant, as the meat was incredible.  If the ownes/managers are reading this, please look at https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190353-d7355556-Reviews-Restaurant_Steak_House-Dudelange.html for the serving options I described.    Thanks!"}
{"text":"Wow I love this place! It has a great casual ambiance. You can watch the planes landing and taking off from Falcon Field airport, so that is great entertainment while you wait for your food. Service is quick. I got a free appetizer with the YELP check in. I went for the kabob and it was ok. It needed more flavor. I ordered the NY Steak and it was excellent. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"They were not prepared for Mother's Day weekend. Reservations were for 6:30pm, we were seated by 7:pm. Not bad . Once we were seated, that's when it went bad....... First we sat for a shot while an the waitress took our drink order. There was 6 of us. She then took our appetizer order for which she redeemed our free appetizer coupon from Yelp. We ordered nachos. After 20+ minutes, no napkins, no silverware and no drinks of any kind! We finally got water still no appetizer. After another hour we were told to go grab our sides from the salad bar. We went, no lettuce for salad. I had to remind the waitress she didn't take my side order. Two hours later we got our food. The waitress forgot our appetizer and two drinks that we tried waiting for patiently. I asked for them and it still took too long so I just cancelled the drink and appetizer order, there was no way I was waiting another couple hours!!! She barely came to check if we needed anything while we were waiting so long!! We ended up being there 3 hours two of it just waiting for some type of service and food!! Ridiculous!!!! Then they competed us one meal??!!! Really??? For horrible service, forgotten orders plus let me add the waitress stated our appetizer had been sitting there in the kitchen the whole time!!! We will NEVER recommend this place or go back. Thank you Stake and Stone for a horrible Mother's Day dinning experience!!!"}
{"text":"I had a bad experience BUT there is probably logical reasons and one of the owners David, made sure to make it up to us!!(my prom group) And I will definitely be back to give this place another chance because I think they really genuinely didn't mean to make us wait as long as they did!!"}
{"text":"Food was great! Service was AMAZING, very friendly helpful staff! Atmosphere was relaxing and clean."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here, although I didn't know exactly how the process worked the food was still great and the waitress was very nice and attentive. When you come here you have to cook your steak yourself on a hot rock that they bring out to you, but don't forget the bourbon glaze cause it's great."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and super filing!! I couldn't finish my whole plate it was so much food!!! The bread was great and the service was friendly and kind.  The only complaint I had was the wait.... We waited an hour before we got our food. But once we got our food it was fantastic!!   The ambience of the restaurant was calm and rustic. Such a relaxing place to eat dinner and enjoy your company. Plus you get to watch planes land outside of the window which is kind of cool. Good place and good food, just be prepared for a wait on the food. But it's worth a try for sure!"}
{"text":"Steak was okay but had huge fat chunks and tendon pieces. Its a lot of pressure to cook it by yourself but it is a fun experience. The service isnt great though thus the 3 stars - I'm a server and a little hypercritical but I'm not a fan of \"I dont talk and I dont smile\" kind of table manners. The meat and cheese board is Gross and super disappointing - half the plate was grapes but the menu said nothing about that and I cant eat those. The whole thing wasnt worth the prices for me."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  Went for lunch.  Good food and concept if you get steak.    It's not cheap but not super expensive.  We went with our toddler and he loved watching the airplanes land and take off !"}
{"text":"Overall, the restaurant deserves a five star review! We were greeted by Justin, our server, and he was great from beginning to end. Very different experience with cooking our food on a stone. Had the opportunity to meet the owner's wife and was great to hear about the startup of their business. Looking forward to bringing the rest of the family in as we were able to enjoy our first experience for our eight year anniversary. Thanks again for an enjoyable dinner!"}
{"text":"The best steak place in Phoenix. The experience of cooking your own steak is amazing, the staff is tremendous! !!"}
{"text":"Already not a fan - crazy smoky, and I have to go to a salad bar for a salad?! I want to sit down, buy a quality steak for dinner, not dodge and weave through burning hot stones and random unorganized people to go make my own salad. Might, might be a decent concept if there was a ton more organization and even a hint of direction.   I'm almost worried to see what my food comes out like.   Guess it's a steak and potato night because I am NOT going to pay for a steak and go have to make my own salad...   Disappointed to say the least!"}
{"text":"If I want steak, it was be Steak and Stone. I love the idea of the 500* stone and cooking your steak the way you like it!! There's no one to blame but yourself. I have been visiting all winter except for one month and I have visited at least 5 or 6 times and I've always been happy. The wait staff is awesome and all that I've encountered have had a great sense of humor, . I am leaving toward the end of April and I will go back at least one more time! And will probably get some more deals on a local website too, for Steak and Stone. And will not leave there without the Peach Cobbler either, whether I have room for it or take it home!"}
{"text":"What a disappointing visit. We had been looking forward to experience this restaurant for awhile and finally decided to get dressed up and try it out. I expected this to be a nice, classy steak house. As soon as we walked in we could tell that it was more of a \"dinner club\" type vibe, which you don't see anymore. All the employees' appearance with how well they dressed and kept themselves was a turn off. Untucked shirts, black jeans as opposed to dress pants, messy buns, facial piercings, and the person who delivered our meat reeked of cigarette smoke. The carpet is extremely filthy with stains everywhere. It took awhile for the server to bring us drinks (my $7 alcoholic drink ended up to be mostly ice). As the unkept server was taking our order, another employee literally walked right in between the server and our table disrupting the conversation. It took 25 minutes from the time we actually ordered until they brought us out the raw meat, and then we had to cook it ourselves (which I knew, this is what we were looking forward to, which is why I don't know why it took so long to bring raw meat that hadn't even been cooked). The cooking experience was lackluster to say the least. They make you use your own fork to cook it, don't even give you any tongs of different cooking utensils so you're expected to touch raw meat with the fork you're supposed to eventually eat off, I wonder how Osha feels about that. With your meal you get to pick salad bar or potato, so since were strongly warned that the salad bar included one trip only (stingy much?) I got the salad bar while my fiance got the potato so we could split both. Salad bar plate was very tiny. We were finished with our steak but we were still eating the potato (that we split) when a server came by and just grabbed my fiance's plate with his fork on it without even asking and they did it so quickly we didn't even have time to get their attention to tell them to bring his fork back. They left the door to the outside seating area open which caused flies to swarming the restaurant bothering our meal (and surprise, the open salad bar). The meat was not horrible, but it was not amazing like we expected. We couldn't wait to get out of there, it was such an underwhelming experience. At some point I'm sure we'll try the Gilbert location to see the difference because I have to assume it's wildly different, this type of vibe would never go over in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Very Unique dining experience. The meat plates are served on a piping hot stone, and you cook & season your meat to your taste...! The wait staff was very friendly and the resturant has beautiful airport ambience. There is a bar right next door also that had live music...  Highly recommend !!!"}
{"text":"Such a neat concept! It exceed our expectations. We were told the wait would be an hour. Luckily we only had to wait for about 30 minutes! The salad bar was slightly disappointing. I'd love to see more options & a Caesar dressing! The hot bar was just so-so. Kind of confusing menu & set up. The restaurant was a bit chilly- dress accordingly!! The rock warmed me right up though. I ordered the tri- tip it was really good!! My husband got the New York strip & it was fattier than mine, but so much more tender! So yummy!!! The table seasoning is to die for!!  The dessert was also good- we enjoyed the strawberry shortcake! The staff was so friendly, treated us like they'd known us for years!! Everyone was nice. We will for sure be back again with friends."}
{"text":"Went in there at 12 PM for lunch. Waited 10 minutes at the front,  no hostess, and no acknowledgment. After those 10 , someone came from back and we finally got sat. Then 10 minutes with nobody taking a drink order, we just walked out and went next-door to Buffalo wild wings. Probably where we should've went in the first place. I predict this place ends up like all the other ones in this building, unless the food is phenomenal.  I unfortunately never got to find out, I can't take a two hour lunch.   Update tried this place a second time. Service was just a teeny bit better. I actually got to where I received one of our drinks. 10 minutes had went by we still hadn't had the second persons drink... The  prices are crazy expensive, And apparently you have to cook the food completely yourself on a stone. I thought it was just served cooked on a hot stone (still not sure).  So I guess I didn't understand the concept, which probably isn't my fault.  I would have to say that's their marketing department's fault. Never got to find out though. Got sick of waiting, so we put five dollars down on the table and walked out and went o pei wei . This was on a Monday night about 7 PM. There were just two other tables with people at them. One person at bar.  I'm not a baseball player so two strikes and you're out in my book."}
{"text":"I liked it. Nifty concept I like rare steak so it was nice to be able to put some heat back on the meat right before I took each bite. They could have been a little better with refills but it's different and I liked it. The interior is dated but not bad."}
{"text":"Unique experience!  I ordered New York Steak(comes w 2 sides), Lava bowl to share with my mom.   They provide free bread, it is pretty good and soft. Lava bowl comes with burrito sheet. It is pretty sweeter than what I expected but it was a good balance for me.  Steak, you are cooking your own. I could make my perfect medium rare! Tip! If you are planning to share a steak and a bowl, order bowl first. So you will have time to wrap your burrito to eat. And then order steak, so you will have time to cook your meat. When I order both at the same time, I was busy cooking my meat and wrapping burrito. But I loved the food and experience!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in our dinner here. We arrived early to avoid the rush and apparently avoided most of the staff. I gave it two stars instead of one because our waitress tried very hard to serve too many tables alone.  Cooking your own steak sounds fun but we had little help and they did not turn out well. The bourbon steak sauce is so sweet as to make it inedible. Baked potato was cold and did not come with the sour cream and butter we asked for. The ribeye was a grisly thing that in no way deserved the $37 price tag. Adding another $10 for a marginal salad bar and chili that is identical to and better done at Wendys.  We went here because of the good reviews on Yelp. It turns out you get a free dessert for writing a Yelp review and on another table the waitress was writing for the customers."}
{"text":"I'll give them 2 stars for the nice server.   Our party of two agrees that this place reminds of where our parents took us as kids,  Ponderosa steak house.  Where the salad buffet was messy and the food looked like it was ready to be thrown out.    The mashed potatoes rare served in these heating chafing dishes and it was dry and crusted around the edges.   The steak cooked on the extremely hot boulder was cool and impressive for the presentation.  And I'll give them the second star for that.    The taste was ordinary and nothing like the steaks we've had at other steak houses around town, the Keg, white chocolate,  city hall, Morton's.    If you're on a budget and need a simple steak, come here.  The food is rated down there with Texas Road House and Outback Steakhouse.    I had to try it since it was in my neighborhood near downtown gilbert.   Maybe if they didn't have the salad bar with the dried mashed potatoes, then I may have considered giving this place another chance."}
{"text":"Update, will change this review to hopefully every restaurants expectations and standards as well as my own as soon as I return to this dining establishment. Due to the prompt, professional mangement operatio, by reaching out, and apologizing, I will return and re-assess after my near future experience that hopefully brings upon happy expected and anticipated endeavours. :)    What could have been a solid four to five star review tonight, 11/11/17 was immediately destroyed the moment the hostess was leading us to our table. On our way being seated another employee...shorter Mexican lady with her hair pulled tighy in a bun had to look at us and say very loudly, very rudely and very uncalled for \"don't you know we close at nine?\" . If it was nine or even8:45 I could understand. It was 8:10pm and it was just the two of us. I had never been to Steak and Stone and was super excited...when she said that I was so offended and disgusted that I looked at her and said \"really?\" And she then paused en route with her giant empty cart, stared me down for a very uncomfortable amount of time, said \"yeah, we are closing\" then preceded to talk rudely about me and to me. Completely uncalled for and seriously, I NEVER write reviews based on service but this was so out of line with her glares and trash talk that continued I feel this must be addressed. I mentioned the disrespectful matter to the hostess but apparently no management was in sight or on duty. Poor, horrible and completely unacceptable. As this could have so simply been a great experience...the horrible, sour bitter \"welcome\" ruined the entire meal, moment, and experience as she continued her harassment throughout our unfortunate horrible dining experience. Complete waste of $70.00.  P.s...my molcajete bowl was five shrimps and a ton of onion...such a bummer."}
{"text":"Well, I can honestly say... I don't get it.  Okay, so full disclosure, ever since I bought a sous-vide tower and started cooking my own steaks with it I haven't found a steak that can compare, but I always try to keep an open mind everywhere I go. So, with that in mind, here's my review!  We came here around 6pm tonight- there were only a few other tables, so we were seated promptly. The service was great- very attentive, friendly, and informative. I ordered the 16oz ribeye with steak fries, and my girlfriend ordered the molcajete with beef. We went to the salad bar and got our salads, which were fine. Nothing exceptional, but nothing that didn't look fresh, either. The bread and butter came out and it was good- the portion of bread was small but it was all tasty.   Our meals were... well... I gotta say, I really just don't get it. Maybe it's because I didn't cook my steak properly? The girl who brought it out said to flip in, and then cut it into strips. Maybe that would have magically made it into an amazing steak, but I wanted to cook it like a \"normal\" steak instead of cutting it into strips, so I let it sizzle for a few minutes on one side, then flipped it and cut it for a few more minutes on the other side- seasoned it, then gave it a couple of more minutes on each side, then let it rest. And it was fine... just fine... but that's really it. I didn't see any advantage to cooking it on a stone over cooking it on a roaring hot cast-iron skillet. Maybe I missed out on something amazing, but I dunno... I just didn't get it.   My girlfriend's molcajete was fine, but the chunks of beef in it were few and far between, and the sauce was... well, it was just fine, but again, nothing really exceptional. Our steak fries were just fine, and the baked potato which we got from the hot bar was just fine.  I really can't say anything bad about this place, and I genuinely do wish them all the best, but I just can't figure out what the attraction could be. If someone wants to cook their own steak, there are better ways to do it at home. The cut of meat I had was good- I believe it was a USDA Choice cut of ribeye, but honestly for the $40 price tag you could go to AJ's an purchase a USDA Prime cut and cook it yourself. And if you want molcajete, there are places in Mesa you can go to which will make your toes tingle. So yeah... I just don't get it, but I do hope they do a great business!"}
{"text":"I haven't yelped in awhile but this visit was bad enough it deserved a 1. I really liked the new one in gilbert and was extremely disappointed. 1. It took awhile after we were seated to have our waitress come and greet us. She dropped off waters and walked away without asking if we were ready to order- I had to ask her back to tell her we were ready (we had been sitting there long enough) 2. They brought out the appetizers just minutes before the steak 3. The knives were not sharp enough to cut through the meat and my friend bent her fork using the utensils to eat 4. Water went unfilled throughout- we had to keep asking 5. The cuts of meat were crap compared to the gilbert visit. 6. The bread was disgusting 7. Plates weren't taken as we finished 8. No manager came over even when complaints were voiced to the waitress. 9. It took AWHILE 10. Not returning to this location"}
{"text":"I was told by a business partner that this place was a great place to eat. I took my girlfriend there on a Friday night. It wasn't what I expected at all. Especially for the price that they charge. Since I had never been there before I had no idea what to do with the steak or the stone. The waiter kept telling me spice your steak. Little did I know that the rack of spices on the table or to be spiced to my liking. I was also a little leery when the first thing I see when I walk in as a salad bar. The steaks were very good to eat but the ambiance the pricing and the staff made it an awkward dinner."}
{"text":"I was there for a business gathering and the concept was new to me. Our waitress explained the setup and how to prepare the meat hot lava rocks. It looked intimidating at first but it was easy enough to handle the meat and cook with it. I enjoyed that a I had the control of the fineness and timing of the meat. Their side choices were poor. I would like to see more variety of vegetables for those who does not want to participate to the salad bar. They had a decent wine selection and a good peach cobbler. Overall it was good experience."}
{"text":"The steak was good. Only the steak. Nice tender cut and good flavor. Everything else left quite a bit to be desired. Salad bar had more salad dressings than toppings. Sides are small for the price. Bread tasted old and stale. Music? We sat next to the kitchen and it's unclear whether we were listening to the cook's odd combo of tunes or it was intended for the whole restaurant (there was no other music). Understaffed but friendly.  For the price we won't be returning and opted not to ask about deserts (that's sayin' something)!"}
{"text":"Amazing! The food is to die for and very reasonably priced. The presentation is perfect and the staff is very friendly and attentive. Perfect place for lunch or a fun date night. Loved that they also had a cozy patio right next to the runway. Highly recommend the steak or course and the Tri-tip sandwich it is by far the best sandwich I have ever had."}
{"text":"Left much to be desired.     Came here excited to try this new steak house concept in the area.  You order a steak and it arrives on a hot stone around 600 degrees and you cook your meat at your table.   Overall great cuts of beef.    I ordered a side of Mac n Cheese and this was easily the worst thing we ate all night.  Had a really weird aftertaste. Wouldn't order it again or recommend.    What made the visit almost unbearable was the service or lack thereof. Arrived to a table in the bar that they never got around to wiping down from the previous meal before us.  Waited over 45 min before anyone arrived to take our orders.  Not sure if the service would have been better in the dining area but our entire table couldn't stop laughing at this point from the lack of service.     Not sure I'd be back, maybe if it was convenient but easily won't go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"This place is more of a novelty for younger crowds than a great place to eat or drink. It's not a great experience because of the crowded dining room, they packed in tables so tight you can't walk between to maximize profit over experience. The drinks were very sweet, the beer wasn't cold and for a steak you cook yourself on a stone, it's over priced. I got the lava bowl which had about half a block of cheese in it. While the cut of steak was excellent I would suggest you get crowds go somewhere else. The patrons are mostly old and the all you can eat salad bar is ok."}
{"text":"So to be fair, I am terrible at cooking steak at home. Ok so with that being said here is my full review.   The waitstaff is nice and attentive. I thought the menu font was hard to read. The prices are reasonable however, I would rather have the steak come out cooked. The concept is cool but in reality it is not that great. Steaks come out unseasoned on a hot stone slab. You have to season and cut your steak up so it can cook evenly on the stone. That is a little odd to me as I felt that allowed the steak to dry a bit as you are eating the steak now in pieces. In fairness though I did not order the steak. This was just my observation of my dining partner.   I ordered the steak bowl (their version of a fajita) the flavor was good. It was chock full of veggies and steak. It is a bit too spicy though. After a bite or two all you can taste is the spiciness.   Overall it was fine. However, if I am craving a steak I would probably go elsewhere and get a steak done right."}
{"text":"We love bringing family and friends to this awesome restaurant. The servers are friendly and make each experience unique. The food is excellent and filling. You can't beat cooking your meat on a stone. We always leave happy and a little fatter around the waist. Definitely plan on stopping by next time you are in Mesa!"}
{"text":"Always good eat ! Good price for a perfect steak!thank you much for great  service.will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. A fun place to go  we have come several times with friends"}
{"text":"I didn't know cooking a steak on a stone was possible....it never really crossed my mind before....I now know it can be done.  This concept is pretty interesting.  We came here for a birthday with a very large party, around 20 people.  I give kudos to our waitress, who I believe was named Christine, with handling all of our orders and keeping drinks flowing.  I am always thirsty and drink a lot, so this is a big thing for me, and she did great.  She was very nice to boot.  The idea behind this restaurant is very cool.  I started with fried pickle spears.  So delicious and it came with two dipping sauces.  Cooking the steak was a lot of fun.  The steak comes out on a stone in a metal tray.  The stone is hot but the metal tray was not.  The steak comes out raw and is already cooking on the bottom when it gets to you.  I had the sirloin and cut it up into small slices.  It cooked up well done, just the way I like it.  I only wish I'd had some garlic seasoning for my steak.  I love garlic on my steak, though I know it is not for everyone.  I had the mashed potatoes with the meal.  They were tasty but I wished that I had butter.  With so many people getting served around me, I didn't want to wait. I would like to experience this restaurant again with a much smaller party for a more intimate feel.  Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Read reviews but still wasn't sure what to expect.  Turns out it is a raw steak served on a thick, extremely hot, flat grey rock on a bed surrounded by small red lava rock in a large tin tray. It took up most of the area in front of me and then some. It came with two sides and i ordered baked beans and the garlic potatoes. They were served in two small bowls and relegated to the side of the massive tin tray and were both very forgettable, but the steak was not. I ordered the 12 ounce house steak which is a top sirloin, advertised as an upper choice cut over 2 inches thick and i have to say it was delicious. It comes sizzling to the table and the server suggested cutting it right away and cooking each bite as i ate. Good advice. I ate it right off the stone and finished every bite. The stone stayed very hot for the entire time and every bite was cooked to my perfection. My friend had the filet and cooked it right away and put it on the provided plate and deemed it excellent but i preferred the caveman style sans plate. Don't see this place as kid friendly because of concern about touching that scalding stone but I'll be back to try the ribeye next."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly, but service was horrible. At the table of 8 a couple of stones came out slightly warm and had to be swapped out. Assumption that the owner or manger came over asked how was dinner, we told him about stones, his reply was that happens. Not my idea of a good answer. My question is how do the stones get cleaned, lava rock is super porous?"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience came here for lunch had a complimentary appetizer and glass of wine.....to my surprise ambient was great this is a Hidden Gem we had the steak on a stone my  mother-in-law was with me and we just had a great time we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I like the stone idea very much. However, I feel like there must be a way to improve the taste of the juicy steak! Meat quality is not as good as described on menu but still good. Food is considerably cheap consider the service and meat! Location is a little bit off but easy to park. And they are on Groupon!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is amazing and the servers are so friendly. Would highly recommend. Even on a busy night and it took them a little bit longer they were still extremely friendly and it was very good!"}
{"text":"Hello, wonderful place and the view is Awesome. Waitress is great! Love this food.  Smells wonderful."}
{"text":"Very friendly wait staff. The concept is fun and I enjoyed watching my steak cook on the stone. The ribs were spectacular. And, the smoked platter a great value. It was fun and I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite steakhouse. It's always fun cooking my steak just the way I like it. The price is very fair for the quality of meat you get."}
{"text":"Love this place! We are on Keto diet, and this has become our new favorite restaurant! The meats are amazing and you get to cook it to your preference. Like the melting pot but you don't boil the flavor out of your meat."}
{"text":"Been to Steak and Stone about 4 times over the last year or so and it's been on the downhill slide since our first visit, but we had kept going back because it is an awesome place to watch the airplanes take off and land at Falcon Field...you are right on the runway!  Went most recently on Saturday, 6/23 and the place was practically empty, except for one other table when we arrived. Service was a bit slow as the waitress appeared to be doing double-duty answering the biz phone, being a waitress, setting up the buffet and acting as a host when other parties arrive. Several dead flies collecting along the window sill as if it had not been cleaned in weeks or months. The ketchup appeared to separate when poured and was super runny even after shaking...not sure if it was super watered-down or just expired, but was NASTY! The Stone burger did not taste fresh at all, kind of like an old meat patty was being masked with seasoning. The ciabatta bread the burger was served on was very doughy and dense. The tri-tip sandwich was very dry and tasteless as if it had been re-heated.   Also, the menu prices are a bit miscalculated. My burger was $9 which came with fries or one trip to the salad bar. I asked how much for fries and salad bar and the waitress said $5, yet a side of fries was only $4. Also, the salad bar had many of the items missing from our previous visit including macaroni salad, which was pretty tasty. Also, the steak fries are some of the best steak fries I've had anywhere, however, this is not enough of a reason to go back.  The biggest complaint is that the bathroom cleaner they use is so strong, you can smell it in the dining area."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, the stone cooking is great fun.   Service is good and if you have your own airplane,  you can beat the traffic and fly in."}
{"text":"Very unique steakhouse experience: \"Hot Cooking Stone\".  If you are visiting the Phoenix area, it is worth trying it out.   \"Hot Cooking Stone\"  They have several choices of seasoning complimenting the steak selections.  Because of hot stone, it may not be a good idea to bring young children. Filet and Ribeye are very good on stone."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch today. Loved having a salad bar option. It has salad, salad toppings and just a few sides which paired perfect with my steak. I usually stick with filet mignon however we tried the sirloin and wow! I love cooking your own steak on the stone. I was able to make sure ever bite was perfect. The house sauce they provide is great! We will definitely be coming back! Side note I heard they are getting rid of the salad bar which is a huge bummer. I love being able to make my own side salad and grab some sauteed mushrooms."}
{"text":"My new favorite place. The server, Tony, was great. \"Tony from Chicago.\" Wrigleyville, no less!      We are from Chicago but live here. Tony was fun, patiently answered our many questions, even laughed at our jokes.  Guided us through the menu etc. Informative, he left \"no stone unturned\"...... The manager, an attentive young man, was present to be sure we were enjoying our meal.       The food was delicious, an amazing and fun experience.        A birthday at our table, we enjoyed a magnificent Towering Chocolate Brownie Sundae !   We'll be back."}
{"text":"First time going here.  Awesome place. Jenna the mgr is great. Great experience and the steaks are premium. Very tender. The house bourbon sauce was excellent. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"You can order your steak raw, with a hot stone, and you cook it yourself on you table to your liking. Once you get the steak, flip it over, and cut it into strips. Thicker strips will be pink inside. Leave it to cook, and enjoy. I tried the rip eye and it was delicious. It's actually an awesome experience, they also had a band tonight (Saturday) playing outside, which added more to the experience. With the meat, you get a one visit to the hot bar and the salad bar. Both were ok, with nice options and a delicious chicken cream soup."}
{"text":"Delicious steaks & Prime Rib! Our server, Grant is awesome and made sure we were taken care. The restaurant also has a great atmosphere. I enjoy having dinner here."}
{"text":"Really... five stars.  In the first five minutes, including in the parking lot, we were greeted by 4 very friendly employees (separately).  That was quite a surprise.  The parking lot was being paved and the employee outside helped us where to park and apologized for the inconvenience.  Inside, the decor was quite comfortable and clean.  Since it is at Falcon Field, we had a great view of a runway.      As seen on the reviews and website, yep you can get meat on a hot stone!  The steaks were tender and juicy. 3 out of 4 of us had the \"Steak Bites on a Stone\".   Very very happy.  The sweet potato waffle fries were soooo tasty and even better with the dips.  The bourbon sauce was a hit with 3 out of 4 of us.  Me, I had to take some sauce with my leftovers!       All of us had the side of those sweet potato fries and the cold salad bar.  I asked to taste the bourbon beans to see if that would be my side dish. (I was wondering because someone didn't like it in the reviews.)  She brought out some for me to try and I liked it.  The beans were like Campbell's Pork and Beans with a mild bourbon flavor.  I grew up on Campbell's beans so I thought it was great!       Everything was clean and fresh on the salad bar. (Something I don't take for granted anymore!)  On the hot food bar, they had three soups too (Beef Vegetable, a Chili and a kind of Chicken soup).      Oh yes, we got a *FREE* appetizer because of checking in with Yelp.  Trying to decide between fried pickles and fried zucchini, the server offered half and half.  YAY!  The pickles were really great and the zucchini had a bit more batter than I prefer, but we were happy to eat til the plate was clean!  Again, even better with the sauces/dips.     I had the bread pudding and Betty had the Peach Cobbler.  The bread pudding was enjoyable, but reminded me that I was too full to finish it!  It wasn't the kind with full size bites of bread, it was more moist than that.  The Peach Cobbler had lots of fruit, warm, not too sweet and served with vanilla ice cream - just right!    The particular two people I have to mention are Alyssa and Rusk.  Truly with them, it put it all totally to a 5 star rating.  I actually think there were five people helping us through the lunchtime meal.  WOW and always checking in on us too.  I would go back to enjoy it all again!"}
{"text":"Ok so here it is; This isn't a steakhouse. However it is very similar to a Brazilian steakhouse in some ways. But it is also very unique.  If you are looking for a Mastro's style steak experience you won't find it.  Buuuutt, if you want exercise the meat demons that you can't keep quiet inside you, Steak and Stone will be the protein laden vessel that you and your meat priest need.  I like my steak almost raw (just seared on the outside) and here I can control that myself which I actually like!"}
{"text":"What a great experience.  The staff was great and the food was fantastic.  If you like spicy, try the lava bowl!  It was incredible and HUGE, could probably feed 2.  My wife had the stone cooked tips, it was also fantastic.  I loved the atmosphere as well.  We now have a new local favorite!  Special thanks to Sarah for the tour and the service!"}
{"text":"I would give it no stars if I could. Let me start off by saying my server was sweet as pie, but they didn't have the meal my husband and I wanted and traveled to the restaurant for. So then we settled for other options...my husband ordered a double burger, which they only had one patty available, and didn't tell us until they served us, but I guarantee you had they told us, we would have left. My steak was salty from all the salt on the stone and the salad bar was slim to nothing. So to make things better for us, they offered us free dessert instead of a discount. We decided to take the desserts to-go, to find out there was ice cream on the desserts they never told us about and it was all melted cause we decided to make a few stops on the way home. They want us to return, but I will honestly say we won't. We were there celebrating my birthday, what a disappointment!"}
{"text":"We went here tonight for my Stepson's birthday and were not disappointed in the least.  We started out with a couple appetizers.  They were good for appetizers but not anything special.  Four of our party got the house steaks, I got the smoked tri-tip and my fiance got the lava bowl.  Needless to say, the food blew us away.  The lava bowl had a decent spicy kick to it.  Most places when they say spicy it is mild. In comparison, but not these guys.  They delivered.  The house steaks had a nice flavor and cooked well on the stones.  Most of us cooked to the temp we wanted and took off, but one ate from the stone.  He even cooked up his fruit on the stone and said it was good.  I got the smoked tri-tip and was one of the best I had.  Really smoky flavor cooked to finish on the stone left my mouth watering.  Overall, it was a delicious meal and we'll add it to outr birthday rotation.  Thanks again to the Staff of Steak and Stone for making our birthday boy's dinner a memorable one."}
{"text":"Such a fun experience. We came for our anniversary and the stake is amazing and you cook it as you please. The farmhouse atmosphere  and the view makes it nice and home like."}
{"text":"Came here with a Meet Up Group as a plus one. It is a great place for large parties with plenty of room.  I ordered the 10oz sirloin with the all-you-can-eat salad bar as my side. The salad bar was pretty decent and can serve as a meal in itself with 2 soup offerings, stews and puddings.  Soon came my steak on a stone with a huge wok type bowl (to keep from burning yourself). I seasoned my meat with the prime rib rub, cut it up and cook it to medium temperature. I found the wok and stone rather cumbersome and got in my way as I tried to reach for the bread (really good) or seasonings and was afraid to burn my cleavage.   Finally, a waiter came and took the stone and wok away and gave me a regular dinner plate to finish my steak on. The steak itself was...mealy. Like it was frozen or brined. It wasn't firm and juicy like a normal steak, it was really soft...  In general, I think I have had better steak for less and I didn't have to cook it myself."}
{"text":"The food was amazing the bar was expensive $13 for a glass of wine but when I ordered another glass with dinner it was only $6 don't get that. The place is rustic and amazing will go back again"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Steak and stone. Our waiter was named Tony. He was totally awesome, probably the best waiter that we've ever had! He was so sweet and very attentive and caring. He was really really wonderful, I wish all restaurants had a waiter like him! He is worth his weight in gold. We never needing anything, he always brought us things without us ever having to ask for anything. He went above and beyond as a waiter, and we made sure to tip him very well because of his great service! The decor of the restaurant....is a whole other yelp review. Lol."}
{"text":"Food is good and environment is cool.  If you like fondu, it's kind of similar.  Lots of fun to cook and eat at the table.  It also has a great salad bar and they have live music.  We tried it for a date night."}
{"text":"Interesting place had a good time food was great and plentiful with a plethora of choices"}
{"text":"If I had to narrow it down to one word, it would be \"meh\". It was a very chilly day so we sat inside, but we were seated right next to the door and people were choosing to sit outside (even though it was in the 50s!) so we had to keep our jackets on to eat. The waiter mumbled a lot and was hard to understand. We had to explain our order several times (we shared a NY Strip and ordered an additional salad bar--not super complicated but not the norm I'm sure). The salad bar was fine but nothing great. The steak was good but didn't taste any better than a steak you'd prepare at home or at a steakhouse where you don't cook and season it yourself. When we paid the bill, the waiter took my debit card and was gone for over 15 minutes. He said he had misplaced my debit card which was a bit concerning. Spent 50 dollars to share a steak and ultimately left still hungry."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Now they have raised their prices, cut back on the salad bar, eliminated the soup and potatoe bar, and charge you $3.99 extra for a baked potatoe. Sounds like a recipe for closure! Even the great bread was gone...instead a dry brown and serve roll. Will not return!"}
{"text":"Steak and Stone good food and great atmosphere different concept of cooking volcanic rock it was definitely cooked perfect because you become the chef salad bar was good nice crisp lettuce and then big brownie with ice cream was a good topper our server was fantastic."}
{"text":"In town for spring training games. Searched yelp for something different. We were a little worried at first about what to expect. It was really good highly recommend and the steak was tender and hot to the last bite"}
{"text":"Great Food! Great Environment! Great View! Great Price! Can't wait to go back!!!!! First time that I have ever cooked on a Stone. The meat was amazing! Best Salad Bar that I've ever had. I'll Be Back!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Great service!!!  Awesome concept!!  I love that I can cook my steak to my own interpretation of well done.  My kids loved it.  They said it is their new favorite restaurant.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place. forgot to use my free appetizer yelp coupon but wow what a fantastic cut of steak. great experience. I went for lunch and the evenings look like they'd be so beautiful with the lighting and the planes landing."}
{"text":"First time here, had the Steak and Stone burger, very good! Service was great. Our waitress Alyssa was professional and friendly. I will definately be back!"}
{"text":"I went to Steak and Stone for my birthday celebration.  My experience was enjoyable and the food was superb!  Tony serviced our table and he was a delight!  I was smiling from the moment I sat down until the moment we exited the restaurant.  I also really appreciated the owner stopping by to check on us and to make sure everything was okay.  You don't get this type of service from restaurants anymore.  The team at S&S truly knows what customer service means and delivers above par.  I want to truly \"thank\" the owner and Tony for A+ service and I will definitely be returning soon.  I highly recommend this restaurant if you are searching for a excellent dining experience.  Great job Steak & Stone!"}
{"text":"What fun..... Never have I dined like this before..... Great food.   Very nice service.   It was our last day in Mesa and wanted to go out so I Yelped this place.   So glad I did...... I got a Groupon coupon for 18.00 worth 30.00 towards our late lunch/early dinner.  So good and fun... We will be back next year!"}
{"text":"I came here because I had a Groupon, but I would definitely come back without one too! The prices run, but it's not too horrible. I love that I can cook my steak to how I want it - it's just the experience that stands out to me. You get an all you can eat salad bar, and you can get your own sides. However, you don't need much because you get full, fast! The complimentary bread they give is dry and the butter is hard to spread, but hey it's free. The service is fast, nice, and exceptional. This place is like an American teppanyaki. I would be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Super great experience and great service. I would definitely recommend for those meat eaters."}
{"text":"Food was decent, service was BAD. I asked for butter 4 times, i gave up with our waitress and went and asked another for butter. It is quite expensive and more like a dining room than a restaurant. Safety did not seem to be very important as I almost got drowned with 2 gallons of water from a bucket as one waiter came charging out of the kitchen.  It is quite expensive $33 for a ribeye(12oz) and the concept is neat, but it's a treck out there and with the poor service I will give it a miss next time."}
{"text":"Delicious and super fun steak house that's NOT a chain! Good value and great staff. Easy to reach off the 202 location, as well."}
{"text":"Really good steak and a fun way to spend the evening. I shared the 16oz strip with my daughter and it was a lot of meat, comes with one trip to the salad bar and one side. For an up charge you can have unlimited salad bar trips and unlimited sides but that seemed like overkill to me. Make sure to season your steak well because it comes completely unseasoned."}
{"text":"Ehh...not my favorite place. Won't be returning here. Was not impressed. Hate their dining room"}
{"text":"Great for lunch & dinner.  Enjoy cooking my own steak on the 500 degree lava rock.  Fun experience.  Millie has the sampler platter that the cooks prepares we could have had that for a meal there was enough for both of us.  When in Phoenix area make this a stop to enjoy the planes landing or taking off from your seat."}
{"text":"Horrible service I felt rushed my fillet was grizzly and tough I was excited to try this place but do to service and inedible food I won't return I made the trip from Scottsdale waste of time and money"}
{"text":"My experience with this restaurant was okay. It wasn't bad it wasn't the best steak I've ever eaten. First I noticed the ribeye that I ordered (which was picked out for me, you don't get to choose) had way to much fat on it. Cooking was a simple process after getting a good crust on the outside, you can cut into strips or chunks to desired doness.  The service was the best, our waitress was attentive and fast for being the only one there.The salad bar was decent and the French onion soup was pretty good. Kick it up a notch with some croutons and cheese from the salad bar! We went at lunchtime and I heard they have better steak selections, I don't know if I will try again."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner tonight at Steak and Stone. I had the Filet, my husband had the tri tip. Both were great. Corn was amazing, beans were awesome. We are pretty picky as we eat out often. 4 stars is great from us, in AZ only Mastros and Mortons get 5 stars from us. It was a lot of fun cooking your own meal. Nolan was our waiter and he was awesome! Very professional while also being a ton of fun. We will be back very soon!!"}
{"text":"While this isn't the \"best\" steak I've ever had, the experience is amazing!  The steak is good, the atmosphere and unique approach to dining is so fun!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Kinda different to cook on a stone. I kinda felt like a cavewoman. That was the positive part of the entire time. The salad bar is very bland. Lettuce tomato cheese and mushrooms and a few others. But no bacon bits?!! C'mon. The side is underwhelming. I left feeling hungry. My steak was mostly fat maybe 4oz of eatable meat out of a 12oz steak. We may or may not be back. But definitely avoid this place on a weekend. Because the only ventilation is one open door. And all of the smoke builds up. Don't come if you hate smoke."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Our server has been so kind. Nice restaurant, delicious food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The food, atmosphere and service is fantastic. I am very happy that a nice steak restaurant is in the Mesa area. I recommend the chopped steak and the vegetable medley. The dinner bread is heavenly!  :-)"}
{"text":"Meh. Not impressed. Good service, nice ambiance, but my steak had a LOT of fat. Hubs had the Prime Rib Philly which he said was \"okay.\"  It's gimmicky and overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Great steak and awesome service tonight.  The month of March is happy hour all day long!!!"}
{"text":"I went to the Mesa location last Friday and sat in Kim's section. Kim is such a great waitress, my drink was never even close to being empty the whole time I was there! The service was great and so was the food! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving 1 star is for our waitress and because I must leave at least 1 star. I feel like she was at least trying to make our experience positive.  This place could be great and I'm hoping we caught them on an \"off\" night. But honestly for the prices here they shouldn't have an off night. We called ahead as recommended and asked if we could be put on the \"list\" about 30 minutes before we were to arrive. The girl stated \"we're not busy so we're not taking names\" no problem as we were on our way. We arrived in about 20 minutes and there were at least 6 names ahead of us. Ok.. Well she couldn't have predicted that. We asked how long the wait was after arriving and putting our name on the list and we were told about 30 minutes. We figured it just be worth the wait as people just kept flooding in. After waiting 40 I thought I'd just check-in again to see how much longer it might be. The girl was away from the desk so I looked and realized that she took someone that was under us as she marked the time everyone got there and they got a table first. Bummer... We finally got seated at a tiny table (party of 3) so okay... The problem is we each ordered a steak on a stone so there was no where to put our salads which was very inconvenient trying to shift things around to find a spot. Now for the quality of the food. A young man brought our stones to the table with the steaks and didn't give us any advice at all about cooking techniques. We didn't know to ask until our waitress came back and asked if they offered advise as she noticed we all had our steaks un-cut on the stone.  We quickly started to cut our meat is to better cook it. Finally the meat was cooked enough to eat (let me also add that my stone was not as hot as the other 2 so I had to borrow my sons).. The meat was very tough and I've definitely had better at my own house with steak from our local grocery store. Now for the salad/potato bar. Everything was a mess, most everything at the potato bar was empty, no butter, no sour cream, no cheese and the potatoes were hard/not fully cooked and barely warm. Really? Let me just say that my husband has a pretty large corporate luncheon coming up and we wanted to try Steak and Stone to see if it might work out for the luncheon..that will not happen! We should have asked for a manager but honestly, we just wanted to get out of there after being there total of 2 hours. Our bill for 3 ribeye's, 1 salad, 1 hard and dry potatoe and an order of steak fries was $137.00. We won't be back! Epic fail.  Update: David S. Thanks for responding with the exact same post on each entry.  This response shows how much effort is really put into customer service. This place will quickly fold. Sad but true."}
{"text":"We tried this place last night for the first time and absolutely loved it. We didn't make a reservation. Wait was about 30 minutes, which we never have a problem with. We ordered a couple drinks at the bar and listened to the great live music. The hostess came over about 10 minutes later and told us there was seating on the patio if we wanted to sit out there. It was such a beautiful night and it was probably the best seat in the house. We could still hear the music inside but still got to enjoy our conversation. Andrade was such an attentive and experienced server. She was so great. We got the chicken and the steak molcajete bowl. That bourbon glaze was out of this world on the chicken. The creamed corn was delicious . Such a fun date night and we cannot wait to be back! Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night with wife and daughter to celebrate my wife passing an exam.  It wasn't packed and we were seated right away.  The table are really side!  Nice leather chairs.  Saw signs for Yelp WiFi...it didn't work well so I switched back to T-Mobile LTE.    Menu doesn't have many options, which I like!  It means they specialize.  Salad bar is $10 or $7 if you replace your side with it.  Wife and I both looked at Salad Bar but it didn't look exciting so we passed.  Waitress warned us that the Molcajete Bowl is VERY spicy.  I accepted the challenge.  I didn't think it was spicy, but it did make my nose run.  If something is seriously hot, I alway get hiccups. That didn't happen.  I'm sure it would be too spicy for gringos which is why they give a warning.  Wife got the steak on a stone and she loved it. For sides she got Mac n Cheese and Mashed Potatoes.  I tried both and didn't think they were great.  Daughter got a grilled cheese with peaches as the side.  Service and atmosphere were very nice.  The manager (not sure if owner) stopped by our table and chatted for a bit.  Considering it was steak and 3 of us ate, price wasn't bad.    I would definitely go back and try the Steak and Stone for myself.  BTW, across the street there are cupcake and frozen yogurt options for desert."}
{"text":"It makes me sad to write this review, I used to like to come here for lunch. A few months ago,  I ordered the steak bites, I believe the  price at that time was $10.99, included a side, and one trip to the salad bar. I thought it was a good value, and planned to take my family there.  I went today, and was shocked at the price increase for lunch. The steak bites are now $14 and does not include any trips to the salad bar. You have the option of forfeiting your side, and getting an all-you-can-eat salad bar for an additional $6.99.  I do not want to gorge myself at lunch or anytime for that matter, so I will not be returning here. It is not worth literally twice the price to come here for lunch. I can understand raising your prices one or two dollars per entrée, but not to put the squeeze on your customers and pay much more. I noticed they have a huge expensive recreational vehicle with \"Steak and Stone\"  emblazoned on it, are the price increases because they had to pay for that RV? Not sure of the purpose of a huge recreational vehicle for a steak restaurant.  The steak bites are still tasty, but not worth the value for me anymore."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner. Tina, our waitress was awesome. We had a big group and she handled everything well and joked well with us. A great place to eat!"}
{"text":"This was a different and fun experience. Never have had steak on a stone, and they explain the best way to cook the steak on the stone. Tony was our server and he was great. Had many recommendations about food to try from the salad bar and the menu. Looking forward to going again soon!"}
{"text":"A very pleasant surprise.  They are new, and there are a few kinks to work out, but Steak and Stone made every effort to make sure we had a great experience.  It's a top notch steak dinner.  Once the service is refined and as the staff settles in, it'll be superb.  Even last night, on New Year's Eve, we had several wait staff attend to us and make sure we had everything we could want.  Why did I try it?  The steak, and it didn't disappoint.  The tri-tip is smoked before being cooked on the stone at your table, and the flavor was to die for.  With the smoke in it, it really didn't need any sauce.  But the waiter brought out the bourbon glaze that was carmelized on the meat while cooking at my seat, and whoa!  It took the flavor to another level.  Also tried a delicious homemade sweet BBQ sauce and a tangy in-house made mustard sauce.  All were great, but the flavor of the smoke tri-tip alone?  Heaven.  The salad was tasty.  Loved the croutons.  And the garlic mashed potatoes were good as well.  The cobbler would have been great if the sugars had carmelized on top.   But if you want a good smoky steak?  Come and get the tri-tip.  It's one of the best steaks I've had in a really long time.  All of the cuts of meat looked like super high quality cuts.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Way overpriced. Daughter and I shared a 16 oz sirloin for $34. You get a salad bar trip (nothing out of the ordinary) and a side (beans, mashed potato, sautéed mushrooms, mixed veg) or you can skip the salad bar and get a loaded baked potato. Hubby got the meat platter and opted for loaded baked potato. The baked potato was stone cold. The cheese had congealed. No butter. No sour cream. Had to ask for those. Hostess had no expression and no ability to speak or be even remotely cordial. They bring the steak on a hot stone and you cook it yourself. The sirloin wasn't that great.  Poor service. Expensive. Not very good. Cold. Poor timing on service. I expect more for $35. I predict a short life span for this concept though it seems popular with winter visitors."}
{"text":"Love this place and so do the kids! A little something for everyone. The Gilbert location is great too!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the most fun steakhouse I have been to in a while! It was our first time in and we had so much fun cooking our steaks and enjoying our time here. I had the 12oz filet mignon and it was perfect. I have been to a lot of very nice steakhouses and this steak was right up there! The only reason I did not give 5 stars was because the sides weren't the best. They could use some improvement, but my steak and salad was more then enough and really good!!! Also, our server Brady was very informative and helpful,  which made the experience even better!!! We will definitely be back and I would recommend trying it out! Very fun experience!!!"}
{"text":"This is a new and different concept for me.  The food and service were perfect.  I'm not so sure that when I go out to dinner that I want to cook my own meat.  My friend loved it though as she could cook it exactly as she pleased.  The waiter was friendly and explained the process.  At one point, I thought I overcooked my meat and so he offered to bring another piece; however, I hadn't once I sliced it open to check on it.  Loved the creamed corn and the free appetizer courtesy of Yelp!  We went here based on the Yelp reviews and appreciate the assist!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time yesterday and was very impressed.  Loved the idea of cooking your steak on the stone and was blown away by how great our steaks tasted!  The bread was amazing as was our baked potato... everything was just so fresh and delicious!  Best of all our server Tony was wonderful... probably the best service I have had here in AZ in 16 years I have lived here.  We will definitely be back and plan to bring family and friends too.  Great job guys!!"}
{"text":"So my first time here. You need to be quick or your steaks won't be medium rare. Buy even I was able to do it, and the steak was great."}
{"text":"Ordered the sirloin steak on a stone, with a yelp check in ordered a free appetizer, steak kabobs were very tasty, the sirloin was a definite quality cut and sized well for 21 dollars, the stone didn't sear as hot as I would have liked, but it was still fun and the quality of the meat for the price was worth the stop, definitely worth trying just for the enjoyment"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for the first time tonite.   The steak that I ordered was absolutely horrible it was so full of fat and the cream corn was So sweet and the macaroni and cheese tasted like it came out of the box for a bill of $150 I was really unimpressed"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time while visiting from Illinois. Such a cool atmosphere! The steak is easy to cook on the stone and the servers are great at explaining what to do. Great food and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is incredible! The employees are  great! The food is delicious! Plus it is just too much fun cooking your steak on a stone!"}
{"text":"The staff was very nice, but the food was not what I would have expected for paying $50 a per person. Drinks were good and strong which can be bad. Salad bar was a joke for a five dollar up charge. Soup was all cold and limited salad was gone besides a few leafs it wasn't even close to closing it was 6pm asked them about it and it hey said that's all that they have. When I got my steak it looked like a New York not a rib eye. It was thin not marbled and a little fat on the outside. The price is for the EXPERIENCE ONLY. I wouldn't come back even if it was free. Ate at Texas Roadhouse and there steaks blew them awa."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch here and ordered a burger and fries with all the fixings. While I was waiting, someone at another table received their signature lavastone steak, and it made me wish I had tried that instead, but I find I can learn a lot about a restaurant by ordering a burger... a simple dish that, in my mind, makes or breaks your restaurant.  Unfortunately, what I received was a disgusting, greasy mess.  While the presentation looked nice on the plate, the moment I picked up the burger it began to fall apart, and the round avocado slices immediately squirted out the side.   My first bite was decent but it didn't wow me. On my second bite I realized the beef they use is actually ground up steak, because it included an enormous chunk of gristle that I had to tear out of the burger like a wild animal ripping at its prey.  The meat was not lean enough to be used in a burger. By the end of my meal the plate, bottom bun, and my hands were all coated in grease. It was dreadful.  I realize ordering a burger at a steakhouse may be a faux pas, but if this is how they make their burgers, why have it on the menu?  This place has been open since 12/2015, but it will not be around in 6 months unless something changes.  Note: They seemed to have excellent service, and probably would have comped the meal if I had complained, but I was in a rush and couldn't be bothered.  Either way, I shall not return."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and live music made for a fun date night. The ribeye was so good. I really like the cook to your own version of perfect concept. The spice blends on the table add nice flavor too. The salad bar was nice and fresh. The hot side bar had some good choices as well. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Steak and Stone is one of the best steak houses I have ever eaten at.  Great salad bar, ample table space and very friendly and helpful staff.  The cook at your table experience is fantastic and is easy enough for an eleven year old to cook his own filet.  Desert may be as good as the steak.  We are going to be regulars here."}
{"text":"So freakin awesome.     Great atmosphere, packed house and steak smells in the air. Plus you get to watch the planes come and go.  What makes the whole damn place good is our server Tony.   I cannot say enough great things about him.  He has a great personality and he's friendly with a nice smile and easy laugh.  My husband and I will only sit in his section and everyone knows it.  Go...meet Tony...thank me later."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place for our anniversary and I'm so glad we did! My husband was tickled that they had a 16oz Filet Mignon, and it was completely worth the price. It was so large we could have shared it and still have eaten too much. It cut like butter and tasted better. The salad bar was good, I particularly liked the seafood salad. I had the sirloin and ribs, which was excellent, but not quite as good as the filet.  I have to mention our server, Tony. He was the best, he gave us a thorough explanation for how to make our experience the best, and walked us through every step of the way. We will definitely do this again, it was quite the experience and a lot of fun thanks largely to the great service we had the entire visit! Oh, and he made us a brownie sundae for our anniversary which was the icing on the whole cake!"}
{"text":"The Tri-Tips were chewy and not cooked enough.  Gristly.   The bun fell apart, like they bought Aunt Hattie's buns from Safeway or Fry's.    The rest of the meal was good.  I'll give them one more try.    The concept for the steaks looks interesting.   The service was very god and quite friendly."}
{"text":"Steak was really really good and tender. Salad bar was a great addition. Being on the runway made it the perfect atmosphere. Had the sirloin and sweet potatoes and both were above average."}
{"text":"Came by after seeing an add in my instagram feed, it was a cool experience the ribs were delicious by far one of the best I have ever tasted, the steak in stone was a cool new experience definitely worth doing again, next time I'm visiting Arizona I'll stop by for sure"}
{"text":"Great steakhouse and love the twist they put on it by cooking your own steak on a super hot stone. We had a little problem with the desert (they brought it out in a stone bowl that was so hot it instantly burned all the brownies and stunk up the restaurant) they were really nice about it and fixed it right away for us and even took it off the bill. Great place and we will be back for sure.  Update: been back a second time and it still was great"}
{"text":"Tina is an awesome server.  Very friendly.  Happy hour is great too.  Patio is great in this wonderful winter we have in Arizona."}
{"text":"This is our first visit here and we loved it!!! We had the trio for an appetizer. The fried pickles were so good. I had the sirloin and LOVED it. I didn't even add any seasoning. It was juicy and delicious. Great quality. My husband had the tri tip and he loved his. Then we shared the key lime pie. I didn't think I would like it (husbands choice) but it was delicious. Our server was friendly and fantastic."}
{"text":"Great place!  A bit pricey, but delicious steak so well worth it!  Been there twice and both times tasted great.  Service was good tonight our server was very nice and even had a gentleman stop to let us know our stone was cooling and we could get another.  I will say never a fan of the bread tho - a bit crumbly and dry."}
{"text":"Great new experience! I wouldn't recommend the salmon on a stone, but the beef bits were good. It's a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a very unique and interesting restaurant.  I had a steak and was able to try all the different seasoning on the it.  I suggest trying the garlic seasoning on the bread. My only complain is that the food on the hot bar was not hot at all.    Our waitress Karlie was very sweet and explained everything to us. She made sure we had everything we needed before we even asked for it. The of the mountains remind me of back home in Colorado."}
{"text":"What a great experience!   This place is altogether awesome!  The food is so delicious and the steaks are top notch!   Great and friendly service as well...I can't wait to come back!  The sweet cream corn was really fantastic as well"}
{"text":"A great place for a fun dinner and out of town guests  Great service. Good food  waitress explained menu to our guests. And everyone thoroughly enjoyed"}
{"text":"We had a surprise 80th birthday for my stepmom.   We had about 35 people attending (most guests were similar age).  Tina and the rest of the staff were amazing.  The food was great.  All the guests seemed to enjoy the food and had fun with the meal.  The private dining room was perfect for our group."}
{"text":"The food was great, especially for the price! They were busy but we got sat down right away out on the patio and still got our food out quickly! So glad we have a good spot to go to in Mesa!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience eating at the Steak and Stone.  The steaks were awesome and fun to cook ourselves at the table.  The staff were also very nice."}
{"text":"We ate here for a wedding rehearsal dinner. The back room was great for our group of 15. Tina, our server, was excellent. Our steaks were out of the world! So delicious!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went there for our 200Day celebrating, the Lava Bowl is a seriously recommend. We also ordered ribeye and sirloin steaks, I prefer ribeye, definitely would recommend to friends and I will go there again!"}
{"text":"Steak was awesome. U cook on hot stone st table. Very fun. At falcon field so got to see an open cockpit biplane"}
{"text":"The restaurant is very nice inside and the view is stunning.  Plus the novelty of cooking on a stone was fun.  But we paid $33.00 for a 12 ounce steak, that I would not have purchased at a grocery store.  At a minimum the steak was about 1/4 to 1/3 fat and gristle.  The meat itself was very tasty, but I really do not think I would order a steak from there again.  The steak came with one side and an all you can eat salad bar.  The salad bar was very fresh and I got a baked potato, which was huge.  My wife had the smoked meat platter that was $14.95.  It was a lot of good and very tasty meats.  But nothing else comes with the smoked meat.  We were there on a Sunday afternoon and the place got very busy and it took about 20 minutes to get our bill.  All in all, I MAY go back, but the price and the quality of the meat would drastcally have to change before I would pay $33.00 for about $7 or 8 worth of steak."}
{"text":"Went to Steak and Stone with my wife for a Mother's Day date. I had heard about it from a bunch of people so I had to try it out.  I got the 12 oz filet with sweet corn and bourbon baked beans. The beans weren't my favorite, but the corn was really good. The steak was seasoned wonderfully, and though I was worried about essentially cooking it myself on the stone at my table, it was super user friendly. The steak ended up being really good! In hindsight, I should have gotten the 6 oz steak because the bread was too good to stop, and with the two sides and a quarter of my wife's meal, I was way too stuffed.  My wife's Mojate Lava Bowl (that's not how you spell it, but the menu is gone) was phenomenal. She got chicken and steak, and the flavor was great. A little spicy, but not bad at all for someone who enjoys spicy food.  I definitely recommend this place. I will say there was a really long wait for the food that normally would have forced a 4-star review, but I LOVED that the owners stopped by frequently to check on us and apologize... I can definitely appreciate that. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here on 10/7.  We were seated right away and the service was terrific.  Cooking your own steak on the stone is kind of fun.  A nice casual and fairly priced place.  They don't accept resevations which could be an issue on busy evenings."}
{"text":"First time at this new place in Mesa. Sat at the bar with the bartender Mike. Dinner was delicious.  Filet was awesome. Service was very friendly and attentive. We welcome this new addition to the East Mesa restaurant scene!"}
{"text":"Steak and stone is the best spot for any family events. We always come here for anniversaries and birthday. The steak is always fresh and amazing."}
{"text":"Our server Nolan was above and beyond! It was our first experience here, and it was beyond amazing. Best customer service! The food was amazing! We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I recently had dinner here (June 27th) with 10 other dear friends. We all have been talking about coming here for dinner for months.  After our dinner, we spoke to each other about our experience....the consensus is none of us will come back. The restaurant was dirty...right inside the door was a dusty, dirty large portable air conditioner.  The carpet appeared dirty and the over all restaurant was drab. We were greeted by very pleasant staff who had our table set for our party of 11.  There were several areas on the tables that were sticky and several chairs that were so wobbly that people felt they were going to break under their weight.  Our wait staff was very knowledgeable about the menu and very helpful, but we paid for good food and none of us felt like we got that.  The restaurant has a unique concept of steaks being cooked on the stones, but it's a clumsy process.  All of us felt that the steaks really lacked flavor and even when cooked medium rare, they were quite dry.   Here is a problem we all were fighting with...While cooking your own steaks, when exactly is it convenient to go get your OWN sides at the hot bar? If you go before your stone comes the sides get cold. If you go while your steak is cooking you run the risk of over cooking your meat. If you go after your steak is done, by the time you get back the meat is cold. We feel the hot bar should be done away with.  Put the sides on the menu and have the customer order them with their meal.  Much less trouble for the paying customer!   The salad bar was sub par and the hot bar was even less impressive (creamed corn was cold in spots) We were so looking forward to a great meal and were all disappointed.   The only good thing about this place was our servers.   We had several neighbors who asked how we liked it and none of us could recommend it.  Sad"}
{"text":"This was an excellent experience.  I had a the prime rib and my husband had the ribeye.  Although my prime rib was already cooked medium rare, I still had the experience of using the stone to heat it up a bit. Also had a bit of my husband's food.  Both were delicious!  The staff was friendly, informative and made our experience even better.  Definitely recommend and will be back next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Great steaks.  Good way to cook them. Friendly staff.  I will come back, price is really good."}
{"text":"Loved the premise, steaks brought out to the table on a 500° stone, cooked at the table. That's where the love stopped. Salad bar was nothing special, a rolling style serving bar randomly in the middle of the room. Sides were good, wine was good. However, the atmosphere reminded me of a budget steakhouse. And we basically cooked our own steak at the table. At the end I got nearly a $100 bill for a well cooked steak (because I cooked it myself), decent sides, a mediocre salad bar, and a bottle of wine. For half the money I could have gone to outback and let someone else cook my steak, and it would have been as good or better. If you want to spend money like this, go to a good steakhouse. This isn't the one."}
{"text":"Today was the 2nd time I have been here this winter. You can't leave here complaining on how your steak is cooked because you cook it \"on a \"Stone\" no less\". The beef tips are the best deal in my opinion. They were out today and they were very gracious to cut another piece of meat for us.  I would give this place a 6 stars if I could."}
{"text":"This was my first visit.  We had a party of seven and arrived just after 5pm.  We were seated promptly.  Our drink order was taken quickly and our order followed shortly after.  Those who chose the salad bar were able to get their salads promptly.    Now the rest of us had to wait almost 45 minutes before our uncooked steaks came out.  We finally got our food and cooked our steaks on the table.  My side dish was mixed vegetable for $4.00, this consisted of three pieces of broccoli, two slices of onion and five slices of green pepper.  After I was half done with my steak my mashed potatoes came out.  We kept seeing other tables with bread and when they were clearing the table I asked if bread came with the meal..the response \"you have to ask for it.\"  Our water glasses were never refilled.  Overall a very poor experience which overshadowed the food.   No recommendation here."}
{"text":"Such a fun and unique concept. Service was great and we had so much fun cooking up our steaks for Mother's Day. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was great! Idea is very cool. A little over priced in my opinion and I'm comparing it to prices and service of Shulas steak house in Wild horse Casino. We had an awesome server named Grant! He made our experience. We did unlimited sides and got the tri tip, cooking it on the Stone was very cool and it was great! Thanks Grant!"}
{"text":"I originally found Steak & Stone through Groupon . It sounded like an interesting concept so I thought I would give it a try . As many other reviews state , you choose your cut of meat ( steak, chicken, shrimp, or seafood )and size and they bring it out on a preheated stone to finish cooking at your table .   We started with their Lava Bowl ( I can't remember the first name ) which can be eaten as either an appetizer or an entrée . This by far was the BEST thing there , we ordered it with shrimp, steak, and chicken . It comes out in a preheated bowl bubbling hot with warm tortillas . It is full of meat, peppers , and pure deliciousness . A must if you visit and enjoy food a little on the spicy side .   For dinner we ordered a ribeye steak and and shrimp on skewers . the shrimp were delicious and using a little bit of their house seasoning on the table made them even better .   The only real disappointment was with the steak. It comes to the table already cooking on the rock , and the cuts of meat are great however, there is absolutely no seasoning on the meat whatsoever and there is nothing on the table other than table salt, pepper and the house spice . My recommendation would be to add a few spices to be delivered to the table with the meat (garlic, onion powder, grilling spice...etc) since nothing comes out of the kitchen seasoned, or offer seasoning options that could be added in the kitchen and delivered to the table already prepped . (I.e. Blackened, Cajun spice, Jerk spice or seasoned butters like gorgonzola or blue chz to melt over the meat as it cooks.) None of these would be expensive add-ons but they would add an awful lot to the experience .   Service was great and we did enjoy ourselves and we will definitely go back again for the Lava Bowl and the great sunsets . We'll reconsider the steaks if they add more options to the seasonings."}
{"text":"It was my husband's birthday, and since he loves steak we really wanted to try this place out.   I ordered the 6 oz sirloin and he ordered the 16 oz ribeye. You can't really blame the restaurant for your steak not coming out the way you wanted, because you get to cook your own steak! The concept is really cool for those of you who like to cook. Especially steak. I don't cook, so I had no idea what I was doing. Lol. Everything came out really good. The only thing we didn't enjoy were the sides. I ordered the Mac and cheese and my husband ordered fries. Both were very bland. On a brighter note, my husband got a free dessert for his birthday.   I think it's definitely a good experience for everyone to try!"}
{"text":"Honestly an amazing steak. The mushrooms are a must have as well. Garlic mash is spot on. Just treat yourself. It's a great little find in the east valley."}
{"text":"I love their concept cooking the meat at the table on stone is awesome. Only thing keeping me from a 5 star is price i think their prices are a little high but everything was delicious and I'll definitely be going back!!!"}
{"text":"What a fun restaurant!  My husband and I were searching for a place to go to dinner and just happened to pass this place and my husband remembered hearing about it on radio in the car so we made a U-turn and went in to eat.  We had a great time.  Our waitress, Liz, was fantastic.  She told us what to expect since it was our first time there and made great recommendations.  She even told my husband about the salmon because it's not listed on the menu.  We cooked our own food!  We got there at the perfect time (5:00) when it wasn't crowded and by the time we left there was a line going out the door.  We will be going back and we hope Liz is working the night we do so we can sit in her section again."}
{"text":"We went here last night for dinner and our experience was amazing! Casey was our server and she was great, she explained how the menu worked and was very helpful. We both got the filet mignon, when it came out Nick helped show us how to cook our steaks perfectly, he was awesome as well. The steak was melt in your mouth amazing. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Was once good but priced themselves out of the market. I think they need new management they just don't seem to get it. The good thing is customers don't have to wait in line to get seated anymore."}
{"text":"We visited the restaurant during the week and it wasn't too busy and felt comfortable.  Our server was attentive and walked us through the menu and such.  We decided to order from the steak and stone side if the menu, also decides to try the ribs and the salad bar.  The idea of cooking your own steak is pretty cool and works well.  However, I assumed that the prices would relate to a premium level meat but found the tri tip a little more tough than I expected and I am not sure how they smoked the meat before serving but it was not very pronounced - did not finish it.  The ribs tasted as if they were boiled before finishing and tasted a somewhat bland - did not finish these either. Seemed like there were a lot of folks enjoying themselves but we will not likely return nor recommend this to our friends. We were hoping that Gilbert finally landed a great steak house but will keep searching."}
{"text":"Steak and Stone was one of my favorite dates my boyfriend has taken me on. Our server was fantastic. The owner walked around and greeted customers. There were a wide variety of sides. Plus, I learned that steak tastes so much better when you make it on a hot rock!!"}
{"text":"I can't be too judgmental since they did just open. Gotta work on some of their kinks but great fun concept. Everyone loves an interactive dinner. Not so much a \"do it yourself\" but it is a \"cook at the table\"   So we had to get a steak. A New York.  Great flavor from the hot rock they cook it on (at you table!) And the bourbon glaze they pour on top. The quality wasn't the best we've had. New Yorks are fatty but this one was poorly cut and had way too much fat to be served at a restaurant for that price range. But very tastey. We like A1 just for a hint of flavor but this really didn't need it.   So the reason we r giving the 4 and not the 5 was because the stone at the table is very hot and cooks very fast. 30 sec for med rare. The manager that brought out the lovely food had good presentation: flipped it over, poured the glaze and sliced it open to see it cook. But he did not bring a plate to put it on, so in the time it took to get one, the steak was a little well done.  And since the steak was cut poorly (one side very thick and the other too thin) it cooked very uneven so we got about 3 bites of perfectly cooked meat.  So that would be our only sour side of this trip.  The other food we got was a pick 3 bbq plate. W pork, tri-tip and brats.  All very delicious served with cooked bell peppers and bbq sauce. Wonderful. Pork cooked just right! Also would recommend the baked beans and cream sweet corn. So delish.  We were full even though the portions looked a little small.  (If u want man size bbq, I would recommend a different place, lol)   Also enjoyed watching the cobra helicopter in the parking area. So def something different.  We will be back.  Enjoyed the ambiance, service, and food very much."}
{"text":"Using a scale of 1-10 with 5 being average, this would be a 6. Just a bit better than your average restaurant.  Coming here I was under the impression that it's a nice steakhouse and while it does look really nice, the ambience is very casual. Nothing wrong with that at all, just if you were expecting something else, know that it's similar to chain restaurants in atmosphere!   Service : great waiter and quick service, including help when asking a lot of questions as this was first time there!   Food: many meat options including a salad bar or a hot sides bar. We got the lava bowl and the smoked meat platter to share. For the lava bowl we opted to pay extra for meat and glad we did as there was barely any meat in there. I am not sure how little would be in there if we didn't ! It comes with 4 tortillas and the meat was hardly enough to partially fill 2 and we were being skimpy with it, so wish it was a tad more ! The sauce was watery and had a kick to it, tasted like Mexican food. The smoked platter was good except the pulled pork was super salty, inedible. The waiter offered to switch it out for another of the meat options or remake it which was nice, we chose extra chicken instead!   At the beginning they bring you a warm loaf of bread with a cinnamon honey butter. It was very sweet almost felt like eating dessert, very rich and dense. It felt like cornbread minus the corn taste, that was the texture of it.   Tips: use the yelp cash back feature! Also use the Groupon cash back feature and get 20% cash back! If you're buying a steak on a stone plate don't forget the free appetizer when checking in! This is correct as of the date of my review, always check around for great deals and new places to visit!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Their portions are huge and it's actually priced pretty reasonable for what you get here. The experience itself was wonderful. All of the staff was very friendly. I loved that our server came with fresh drinks when our current ones were a little less than half. Never had to go without a drink and never had to ask. I always appreciate that. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Interesting concept but mediocre food. Ribs were cold , prime rib had a lot of gristle and was cold. Can't imagine going back. Way too expensive for the quality ."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying if I could give this place six stars, I would! This place is awesome. We ate here for the first time at lunch. My wife had the tri-tip on the stone and I had the steak tips on the stone. The meat was fabulous, tender and juicy. You cook on the 500 F hot stone they bring out. So, you cook to your taste of doneness. The salad bar was great and included as well as a choice of one side. And the price? Amazing!! My wife's was $9.95 and mine was $10.95. A huge bargain for what we got. If you love steak, you should try this place."}
{"text":"Went to dinner last night with another couple, the first time for all of us, not knowing what to expect. Wait staff was friendly and attentive and explained that the hot bar is where you get your sides and the salad bar comes with the meal. We didn't get it when she said you can get your salad anytime....we ordered drinks, an appetizer and dinner. By the time we finished the appetizer, our filets arrived on the gigantic metal trays that hold the hot stone. We had not yet gone to the salad bar and now there was no room on the table for a salad plate anyway . The whole experience was very awkward. Since we all like our steaks med rare it didn't take long to cook. After the steak is done to your liking they come around to take  away the metal trays. Then we got in line to get our side and salad. By this time the steak is sitting on a plate getting cold and by the time you eat the salad it's even colder. The wait staff needs to explain to get your salad before the dinner arrives. This would have been a 5 star review had it not been for the awkwardness of what should have been a good experience. Also I would recommend a table instead of the booth we had, it was difficult and annoying for the person on the inside to get out for the side dishes. Cooking the steak on a stone is a good concept but needs some tweaking. Was not the best experience, however the filet was delish!"}
{"text":"The gimmick at this restaurant is that you are served raw steaks that you cook yourself on a stone heated to 500 degrees. I was part of a group of 14 from our community. We had ONE server and it took over an hour to get our food. How much time does it take to serve a raw chunk of meat? I'm sure the sides were previously prepared, so I don't see how it took an hour to get our food to us. I ordered the Steak Bites, and by the time they were served, they were already over cooked. My sides were a baked potato (perfectly cooked) and an absolutely tasteless quinoa and sweet corn dish. The tray with the hot stone on it takes up so much room on the table that it is virtually impossible to get to your food. I had completely finished my meal (what I could eat of it) before the tray was removed.  To her credit, the Events Manager did speak to some of us as we were getting ready to go and when she realized some of of were dissatisfied, she offered us a 10% discount for our next visit.  I didn't need the coupon, because there will BE no next visit for me."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an experience where you actually get to get involve with your steak in a new and innovative way check out Steak and Stone!  The hot stone is brought to your table and a cut of meat of your choice is placed on the stone where you can participate in getting it cooked just the way \"you\" like it!  The cold and hot food bar has a wide variety of delicious choices you won't find just anywhere and you can also order some hot items from the kitchen that are included with your meal!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Richard got the all you can eat salad bar and I got the steak bites. The steak bites were so very well seasoned that no steak sauce was needed. They have a very good variety of foods on their salad, soup, pasta bar. The view of watching planes take off and land was a bonus. I highly recommend Steak and Stone.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place for quite some time and I'm glad we finally got a chance. It did not disappoint. They are known for their steaks that you cook on a sizzling hot stone to your liking but also offer other pre made dishes (ribs, burgers and what our server described as a fajita soup). We both opted for the steaks, one ribeye and one sirloin. We ordered a shrimp cocktail as an appetizer and it was as good as it looked. They offer a full salad bar with just the right amount of options as well as soups and side dishes (sautéed mushrooms and onions were my favorite). The steaks come out on your stone completely raw and you season and cook them to your liking. Everything about our experience was top notch. From the food to the service to the atmosphere (they had live music the night we were there). Highly recommend this place for date night, family gathering or just a good meal!"}
{"text":"Great service & very interesting. Only down fall is the quality of meat. It's cut different & that makes it taste not as good. Over all, it's a great experience for sure!!!"}
{"text":"If you want an amazing steak, outstanding service, and fun atmosphere this is the place. My husband and I tried it for the first time tonight and we were pleasantly surprised. Such an interesting concept. The waitress was terrific. The owners are very attentive and made sure we had a great experience. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The concept of this place is perfect. Choose your meat and they bring it out raw on a 500 degree stone so you can cook it yourself. Talking with the staff they make the claim their meat is never frozen, and it tastes like it. I went for lunch one day and then back for dinner the next. Their lunch menu is smaller than their dinner menu but you still have lots of options. Their bourbon glaze is a must try for the steak. Full of wonderful flavors. Their bourbon beans are also amazing. Using what I'm assuming is the same concept for the sauce of the beans. I was only here for a business trip and fell in love. I wish they had something like this near where I lived. I will definitely go back if I'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time and it was a lot of fun! What a cool and unique idea! I've never cooked a steak on a lava rock before and it was quite the experience! I don't think the food tasted as great as it could of, I think the owners are trying to make it better since they are so new. My suggestions: offer some sort of seasoning selections for your meat. I was not aware there would be no flavor and the steak tasted a little bit like the rock. Also, I ordered a baked potato that came with just butter and sour cream. You call that loaded!? No way, I need chives, cheese and bacon if you could. Lastly, the bread served in the beginning of your meal should come with regular butter as well. Eating something sweet before dinner was different. Overall, cool place to try! I hope they bring more flavored in soon because I would like to go back."}
{"text":"Took some friends there a couple of weeks ago, first time to this location. The meat was tough (no we didn't overcook it!) salad bar was good but kind of expensive and the service was terrible. Long wait for drinks and to order our food. Then after food was delivered, didn't see waitress again until the end of our meal.... Luckily we saw a bus boy so we could ask for steak knives!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience. Food was fantastic and the service as well. David is one of the partners and was cracking us up the whole time. Rachel was our server and did a great job. Moscow mules were among the best I've had. Cheers to bar. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to have dinner that could satisfy the diverse members of our group, when we saw this place on yelp.  I read a few reviews and we decided to give it a go.  The place was right on the airfield at falcon field.  It was night and the runway lights were lit up, making a nice ambiance.  The decor inside was nice and the staff very friendly.  Our party was sat immediately. We used the free appetizer check in from yelp and it was honored right away and without problem, which was nice. A girl explained to us the choices and suggested the steak bites for easy cooking. Our party ordered the steak bites, the filet, a sirloin and I had the meat platter. The drinks were served in huge mason jars, which I loved. I didn't even finish it, it was so big! The presentation of the raw steaks on the streaming hot stones, was quite impressive.  They explained to each person how to cook their cut to get desired doneness and they removed the stones right away when you were done with them.  (Which I was thankful since I have 2 Littles). The steak bites cooked the fastest and were the easiest to do. The meat platter was cooked when it came out, but it was delicious! The chicken and the tri tip were my favorite and were so juicy and flavorful. Each meal came with a salad bar and hot bar that had ready made sides.  We had a wonderful experience and the prices were quite reasonable.  Would definitely recommend this place! What a gem in North mesa!"}
{"text":"What a joke! This place could be so good but through lack of management it will eventually fail. The place was dirty, server was clueless, food was tasteless and cold. Felt sick the next day after eating half my chicken. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Steak is the best any of has had in a very long time.  We had the rib eye and filet.  Cooking the steak ourselves was interesting but actually turned out great..A must do!  Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"We drove in on an impulse as we have driven by many times & never stopped. We were interested in trying it out. Very nice atmosphere and Judy, our server was friendly and helpful. All you can eat salad & hot bar for $15. Not bad. We did one trip for $10. 3 hot dishes, 3 soups and a decent salad bar. I would come back & try dinner for sure"}
{"text":"Delicious steak and fun concept, would recommend to anyone. Came here with coworkers as an outing event and we all enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Their website says they're open for lunch. Their recorded message says they're open for lunch. We went out of our way to try this restaurant's Mesa location for lunch on Thursday. Guess what? It was locked and dark with not a soul in sight.  We won't be trying Steak and Stone again anytime soon."}
{"text":"My husband brought me here for lunch and I was excited. Turned out to be a big bummer. The salad bar is tiny, barely labelled, and the lettuce was wilted. His steak was just okay. There were no sauces and a little jar of seasoning that didn't have much flavor. I got the pork loin on a stone. It came out pre smoked and cold. They smoke and refrigerate it. Kind of makes the idea of cooking it on the stone pointless. It was incredibly dry and I set it aside after one bite.  I asked for mixed veggies and got four broccoli florets and some overcooked bell peppers and  onions. My son got the mac and cheese and a side of baked beans. The mac and cheese is a small bowl of Kraft mac and cheese. The beans are obviously out of a can. Took about 35 minutes for it to come out to the table. Our waiter did remove the pork from our bill which was nice, but we didn't see him throughout the entire meal until it was time for that bill. No refills, no \"How's the food, can I get you anything else?\" Nothing. Side note: Bathrooms were not clean. For cold pork, boxed Mac,  and an okay steak, it definitely wasn't worth it. Next time we'll buy the food at the grocery store and cook it ourselves. More taste and better service that way.  Edited after response from Manager: My husband asked the waiter if there were any sauces and he simply pointed at the seasoning jar on the table and walked away. The response addresses a couple of things that wouldn't have been a big deal by themselves, but everything together including the lack of service throughout the meal does not account for \"occasionally getting it wrong\". Btw, the pork was not rare which you can see in the pic I posted of the cold pork on the left. It was fully cooked and completely dry. Anywho, I do appreciate the time he took to respond, but we will most definitely not be back. Too expensive to chance that they might have the \"occasion\" to get it wrong again."}
{"text":"Wow! Such an amazing experience, concept is on point and unique. Decor is charming and warm, we will be back. The entire table, sans 4yr old went with the steak on stone option and did not disappointed. I would say the filet I had was probably the best I've ever EVER had, very tender and moist, yes cut easily with a fork. I have a soft spot for A1 so hope I don't lose points for opinion there. Wow, I can't get over it, everything was amazing. Salad bar was the perfect size, clean and satisfying. The \"hot\" bar was also on point, I would have to say my only suggestion to ownership would be to invest in a second hot station for staff (since whatever side you order is dished up by your server right along side guests - it felt kinda awkward elbow to elbow with so many servers at once) just my two cents. View is incredible, sunset is really the most impressive time of day. Great, now I'm hungry again."}
{"text":"First time, loved it. Will definitely be back. Great experience, delicious steaks stone cooked, comortable, and great Happy hour  prices. Hilary our waitress was awesome."}
{"text":"We originally tried for Saturday night and ends up back tonight.  The manager greeted us and was very friendly and polite and seated us right away. Our waitress was great, she answered all our questions and was super nice. We ordered an appetizer recommended by manager when he sat us, excellent choice called the fried tower.  We ordered filet medallions and 16 oz sirloin, it was amazing!! Then entire meal and service were exceptional, staff was extraordinary!  Highly recommended and we will definitely be back!! Thank you for a wonderful meal and dining experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and had great service with an unbeatable steak. Good venue located on the airport with views of aircraft flying in!"}
{"text":"Food quality was poor to fair and, for the price, I did not like having to cook my own steak on a hot stone at my table. The steak stuck to the stone and had to be torn from it using my knife and fork. The stones got cold too fast because exhaust fan was blowing on us and our table the entire night.  Pasta salads on salad bar were not very good either and the croutons were extremely salty. Also, side items from the hot bar were gross in flavor. A steak cooking at table next to us was smoking heavily and the exhaust fan blew all the smoke in my son's face. He had nowhere to go to avoid the smoke. He began coughing and having trouble breathing. Several employees passed by our table and saw him, but offered no assistance. We thought we would give this place one final opportunity and order the brownie in a jar for dessert.  Sadly it was a final opportunity to disappoint. The brownie was too hard and too dry to eat. I do not recommend this place to anyone and I will not go back. It was $100 mistake for dinner for two. Lesson learned!"}
{"text":"Best steak I've had in awhile. Very tender, and yummy! Sides and salads are great too!! Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a new and exciting dining experience, I highly recommend Steak and Stone. You get to order the meat of your choice and cook it yourself on a pre-heated huge piece of flat stone. I most definitely enjoy the experience of doing it. They serve high quality meats and it was certainly delicious. Occasionally, they stop by to reheat your stone again. They also teach you different techniques of cooking it depending on the types of meat you've ordered.  The only reason I did not give it a 5 star was because of the chaotic situation when I first arrived at the front door. Waitresses were also the hostess. Everyone was panicking, lost and seem to be all over the place (perhaps they were short staffs that day?). When we finally got seated, we waited 15 minutes before our waitress took our order. We do, however, know that it was not her fault. She did apologize and checked up on us quite often shortly after. Other than that, it was a wonderful experience and I do plan on coming back here again.   P.S. They do not accept reservation. However, they do if you plan on arriving within 20 minutes from the time you call in."}
{"text":"Fun experience!  The experience starts as they sit you and you order your steak and if you want to have the buffet style salad.  Once you order, you wait until the stone is brought out with the steak.  It is really fascinating to see the steak being cooked in front of you on a stone.  The steak was pretty good and I enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"Very friendly. Excellent ambiance. Jenae, our server, was great.  For our first time eating there we were pleasantly surprised by the experience. And the food was good too!"}
