{"text":"This sushi restaurant is one of my favourite sushi places in town to eat at. I always have a good experience with the service and the food and I have never once been let down by the well made good Quality sushi. Also Another thing I like about this restaurant is the way you can order your food. You're given a marker by your waiter and you mark down the number of dishes you would like to choose from. I find this is one of the easier ways to order your food because you're less likely to receive the wrong order of food at your table. And it feels like a more organized ordering system that other restaurants don't have. I think there food is reasonably priced for the amount of food you get. I recommend this restaurant If you love sushi, this is place for you."}
{"text":"Definitely a good place to go, not too busy - food is fresh.  The little yogurt drinks they give you scare me...won't touch that."}
{"text":"I dislike how the rolls here are cut way too big they're hard to eat in one bite. Service could be better, the server never came to check up on how we were doing although we were the only table there."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place. It is not the best sushi in town but for what you pay it is awesome. Service is a bit slow though. My favorites are the Hanami roll, flame dragon, miso soup (plain but yummy) and their sea weed salad is good."}
{"text":"I used to work by this place. I would get rolls from here quite often as my 18 year old self did not know much about good sushi then. But as I got older, I started to try more sushi places around the city and outside of Calgary as well. Honestly some of these places really knocked my socks off. So after a couple years, I decided to try Sushi Hanami again. I had liked it so much in the past, it had to be good still. Right?!  Wrong. Like Quyen B., I got the Spicy Sashimi salad and found it was literally swimming in sauce. It had maybe 3 small pieces of sashimi in it that I could find. The sauce really killed the dish for me. It was just too much. I also had some Edamame, the Dynamite Roll and the Spicy Tuna Roll. The edamame was good. The rolls on the other hand were huge, so they were hard to eat. The rolls were just okay, but I seriously question whether the fish in these rolls was actually fresh. Service was also a bit scanty. Our waitress never came by to see how we were doing or if we wanted another drink. My friend kept having to flag her down for everything.  Maybe it was good when I went there or I just didn't know any better, but it was very disappointing. There are way better sushi places in town. In fact, Momoyama is just up the street and I found it to be way better than Sushi Hanami."}
{"text":"Love the place, my son recommended, tries takoyaki for the first time, service is fast even though such busy place"}
{"text":"Alright, let me put Sushi Hanami through my personal calculator of value, location, and quality and see what it spits out:  This place is pretty darn good.  A B+ or A- in my books.  The maki rolls and sushi are tight and fresh.  The takoyaki balls are particularly excellent.  The japanese pancake is a revelation.  GOOD VALUE here too.  The korean stuffs (e.g. bibimbap) are so-so.  Nothing to write home about there.  But they aren't terrible either.   And since I always like to throw in a complaint (very Canadian of me) or sarcastic observation to earn street cred for not being a shill: the one bad thing I can say about this place is that even though they post on the door that they're open til 10pm or that they're open \"late\" on Friday/Saturday....they aren't really open late at all. The staff apparently have a life and frequently wants to go live it by not being open all that late.  Which is a bummer because I like to typically stroll into a place late and not be refused service 50 min before the purported closing time.  But hey, that's my problem and not yours.  : )"}
{"text":"The food is ok. Don't ever order the spicy sashimi salad. They drowned in the spicy sauce.   They can serve the food but when it comes to problems. They have no clue how to deal w them.   They just say sorry that is how we make it here. Sorry. Maybe next time. They have no clue what customer service is all about. They are like robots.  So sad. :("}
{"text":"Delicious that's it. They have the best teriyaki beef in town. Also their gyoza is very flavourful. Crispy outside and so much flavour inside. Will be back here for more teriyaki."}
{"text":"Good service, great food, and inexpensive, I'll definitely be back. My only nit picky complaint would be the teeny water glasses, that only ever get half filled, so you can only have a sip of water between refills. But I was very impressed overall."}
{"text":"Wow !!!!!!!!! I come from the west coast and I know good seafood. This was incredible!"}
{"text":"Sushi Hanami is a great sushi find in SW Calgary.  Nice and close to MRU on 37th, Hanami has great service and reasonable prices - and as a bonus, its relatively undiscovered nature means that you almost never have to wait in line in the evenings (for lunch, I can't comment).   The spicy tuna salad is piled high with tuna, crispy lettuce, and plenty of spicy sauce. It's a bit of an odd dish, and while it wasn't on point for my companion I would certainly order it again.   The sunomono is a decent size for the price, and quite tasty, and the portion of \"appetizer\" yam tempura is enough for a meal. The yam tempura roll is also generously portioned and topped with a sweet sauce that makes it extra scrumptious.  Also of note is the salmon sashimi portion size - I'm always impressed when they come out, and the tuna (although not quite as remarkable) is a good size as well.   My informal price estimate it about a 15-20% edge on something like Globefish, which makes a hearty sushi for two $45ish instead of $60ish - and that's good with me.  If you are in the SW and looking for sushi, this is a quick, affordable and tasty option worth trying."}
{"text":"Really good valued food. Unlike most othet japanese restaurants, this one's sushi rolls are large and tasty, lots of stuff inside, will visit again"}
{"text":"Unfortunately despite the beautiful atmosphere and the really lovely server we had, the rolls were just BAD. My only good memory of this place is the Sashimi and the Ice Cream! The rolls were too big to fit in your mouth in one bite, and we could sense the prawns were not fresh at all."}
{"text":"This Korean run sushi joint offers the usual selection of Japanese fare - bento combinations, rolls of various kinds, nigiri and the like. Service at lunch is average in speed. Like other reviewers have noted, the nigiri slices are on the thin side.   Your bill comes with a small bottle of cultured milk (Korean yakult) per person.  To-go service is slow. Plan to eat there instead."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place so far in Calgary.  In contrast to one of the prior reviews, I like the fact that the sushi rolls are large.  Yes, they are too big for one bite, but that's what I like about them. I feel like you're getting your money's worth.  Also, I've gotten take out on several occasions and they are super fast."}
{"text":"Amazing service, high quality fresh sushi, large selection and topped off with great atmosphere! If I lived closer I would come here often!"}
{"text":"This place was great!  Fast service and great food!  The final bill came to $40 (for one), so I should have taken it easy on the sushi, but it was worth it!  I would go with sashimi instead of sushi, as the amount of meat you get with the former is a lot more than the latter (for the same price)."}
{"text":"Luckily I registered for parking. Otherwise it's a ticket. They are saving a ton on heating costs. I had to wear my coat the whole time. The table was so gross that the plate was stuck to the table. There is better sushi at the grocery store. Dried out, bland fish. It's fast and cheap. Not good. I won't be back. Then they wanted to take my tray away when I was only half done. There are much better choices so I won't be back."}
