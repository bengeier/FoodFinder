{"text":"From someone with extensive corned beef and pastrami background, and over 60 years of \"Deli\" experience, the best \" smoked meat \", similar to what I would consider \" Romanian pastrami\".  Tender, moist, with a little spicy bite.  Excellent... Served on three pieces of rye bread, which was better than average bread.  The mustard was a dark dijon, and very good.      There is a very good selection of pickle cucumbers, cole slaw, potato salad, home made gefilte fish, schnitzel, etc. All Kosher, too.      Bad News, there is No seating !!!!   Great smoked meat to go!!!"}
{"text":"This place does not hold a CANDLE to Schwartz's. Smoked meat is rubbery crap like Toronto fare or Lafleur. Also bought a falafel plate - 12.99 for five falafel balls and some iceberg lettuce? I should have known this wasn't going to end well when I asked for tahini and they said \"we don't have that\". Lol."}
{"text":"Take out only.  Really a great sandwich.  Very juicy. Very meaty. Almost a BBQ flavor. They also have good soups and kugel.  These people care about their food and community and it shows."}
{"text":"this is the best kosher deli in montreal. a few tables/chairs even a bar would be useful, as now this is take-out only. I hope they expand!"}
{"text":"Delicious. We got roasted brisket on rye and ate our sandwiches at a nearby park. The meat is fall apart tender."}
{"text":"Amazing food, and really the best smoked meat in Montreal!!! Schwartz has nothing compared to this. Great pickles too!"}
{"text":"Delicious everything!  Our favorite was the smoked meat sandwich!  The only problem was we didn't realize it was carry out only with no place sit and eat. A nice customer let us know there was a park just a few blocks away where we were able to enjoy our feast!"}
{"text":"Amazing! The classic Montreal smoked meat is finally kosher again. There take out dishes are also delicious. My whole family loves this place"}
