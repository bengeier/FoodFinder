{"text":"Its 10 out of 5. Excellent pizza. Ordered for the first time and loved everything about the pizza. Awesome. Delivery time was good. Hot served pizza. Just keep it up."}
{"text":"Generous toppings, delicious crust and juicy meaty wings (x-large pizza and 2 dozen wings: tandoori and jerk wings).  What else can you ask for? Besides an owner who spent time chatting with you to make sure you got all that you needed.  I'll be back because Mike is hard working and personable.  And the yelp deal which i also picked up was an awesome steal."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best restaurants I've been to in a while! The food was DELICIOUS, me and my friends were beyond satisfied. Had the jerk chicken pizza, jerk poutine and honey garlic wings... We demolished everything, no leftovers. The service was amazing, Mr. Mike is such a nice guy(looks like Omar Eps) I recommend everyone check out this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing! The food , the service! No explanation needed. Try it one time and you'll be a believer"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza.. This place seriously surprised me!! My bf spotted the pop up sign and decided that we needed to try it out. Ordered the meat lover pizza and it was great. Love the thin crust. The pizza took some time to make (I'm very impatient) so next time I'll definitely call and order ahead!"}
{"text":"Had the jerk chicken pizza which was strong but excellent. Loved the complimenting coleslaw with the spiciness of the chicken and sauce. It was a bit of a wait and my wife wasn't a fan of the strong flavors but I disagreed. If you like your food with a kick this is a good affordable pizza."}
{"text":"With Mr Mikes, there is now a total of 4 Pizza joints in the area. The other being Pizza Pizza, Pizza Hut &
 Pizza Nova. I stopped in at Mikes today for lunch. Pizza was fresh out of the oven, when I walked in. 2 Slices, Pop and a Dip, $5 +tax. Pizza is good, Slices are long and thin. I prefer a thicker crust and cooked more, not to say it was under cooked, I just prefer a crispier crust. 

I would go back. They have wings, I'll almost never turn down an opportunity to have new wings. There was just the one guy working, when I was there. Not sure if that was Mike,but he was prom,pt with service and very friendly.

If Mike is reading this, having grown up in the area and gone to school. Look into some student specials. You have a few schools in the area,and one a stones throw away."}
{"text":"Have been there many times! Great food, great service! Never disappointed and prices are very reasonable.

Recently changed their name. You can find Mr. Mike under the listing Mitaza Pizza

{"text":"The food is very innovative and amazing... my hubby & I ordered Jerk pizza and regular poutine. Not fun of spicy but worth a try to a different level of pizza... we will try a different pizza next time..."}
{"text":"Two words, jerk wings.  Pizza is good, nice sauce and generous toppings but the wings are out of control."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed when I walked into here was the customer service. They are amazing and super welcoming. The kind of customer service that just makes you smile and cares about what you want. 

My friend and I ordered a medium pizza with only cheese and a small poutine pizza. The total came up to approximately $25. Definitely worth the price because the pizza was delicious!! Especially, the poutine pizza. It was rich and heavy, very filling. 

I totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Blog.TO my wife wanted to try a new pizza spot and came across this gem in the east Scarborough area...

Truthfully I was surprised at the options available at Mr.Mike's the menu is diverse the staff are so friendly and the amount of deals geared towards fair pricing (daily specials) and customer retention are way more than most mid sized pizza chains 

That being said the JERK WINGS are the truth and based on the previous reviews that is what anyone should order by default regardless of what you are there for

The Garlic bread already comes with cheese and if you want stuffed crust they already have you covered...if you want pasta or gourmet poutine they have that as well. But if you want a salad the size is bigger than Wendy's and looks a ton more fresher 

Without question I will be coming back...did I mention you get a free medium pizza if you sign up for the rewards card on your next visit - that's called incentive #imimpressed"}
{"text":"The bf and I stopped by for some quick eats after a long bike ride along the waterfront. We ordered the $4.98 yelp check-in deal (plus 2 extra toppings), and a gourmet style poutine. Total was ~$15 after tax which is a steal for two people!

First of all, I should be clear that everything at Mike's is homemade (within reason). Definitely all the pizza crusts, tomato sauce, buns... Wings are battered and baked in house (yup, not deep fried!) :)

The pizza has a nice thin crust, with a tasty housemade tomato sauce. The style of the pizza is more of a thin crust american, rather than italian (which has less cheese and more of a snap to the crust). Sausages are a little bit spicy for those who like a bit of kick. 

The gourmet poutine was great! Mike will put any available pizza topping on your poutine. We chose steak and onions. So good! I don't think I will ever order poutine again without steak. Mike offers 3 types of poutine gravy -- chicken, beef and vegetarian. We didn't know this when we ordered, so Mike gave us the chicken gravy which really let the steak flavour come through. However, it is great to know that there are other options!

Before we left, the bf and I got to talking to Mike the owner. He comes across as a real genuine guy with lots of passion. I could tell he wants to do more with his menu and eventually expand. He's only been around for 1.5 years at the time of this review and is off to a great start. Let's support our local small businesses!"}
{"text":"After seeing all of the great reviews, and it being in my area I decided to give Mr Mikes a chance. First thing I noticed after walking in was the cool African decor. I feel bad giving 3 stars because the lady working was very friendly and nice and even turned the AC on just for us as it was really hot that day. I had high hopes for the pizza, but once tasting it I was pretty disappointed. My pizza looked nothing like other reviewers photos. The crust tasted and looked like the store bought ready made crust, it wasn't doughy and soft like I expected. The tomato and garlic dipping sauce wasn't very good in my opinion either. I will however, give Mr Mike another go simply because of the great customer service and other reviews and hope for the best!"}
{"text":"Jerk Chicken pizza was tasty,  but didn't live up the hype. The Chicken Parmesan was absolutely terrible, one of the worst Pizzas I've had. I will definitely go back to try to the Jerk Chicken poutine though."}
{"text":"Friendly service, very helpful and truthful! Great food, met my expectations. I tried the Jammin Jerk Pizza. It had the perfect amount of spicyness (The good kind of spicy) for those who are scared of a little heat don't shy from this gem. The coleslaw on this pizza made it fantastic and surprisingly memorable. The employees also don't oversell their food, they said what was good and it was actually good! 
Very clean and tidy. Definitely going to be back here again to try their Poutine Pizza and maybe some others."}
{"text":"Great stuff on very reasonable price. Thank you Yelp!

My friend and I were starving and we were looking for a place to eat nearby, yelped the area, found Mr. Mike had good reviews and decided to give it a chance. The reviews did not disappoint!

Service - best takeout experience ever!

The main person (Mike?) was very kind and generous, we were going to use the yelp check-in deal with a few extra toppings, but he said it will be more expensive.

So he offered us a medium spicy pizza and still applied the discount that we were going to get for the small pizza for checking in.

Food:

After we ordered our wings and pizza, we were looking around at the shop, we saw pictures of some of their menu items that we will definitely be coming back for (steak poutine)

Spicy Pizza was very rich in flavour, probably the best pizza i have had from a local pizza shop.
The chicken used, was not just grilled, it was marinated and had a lot of flavour, the cheese used was good and the crust was perfect. The spices were on point to make it just the perfect spicy (not something that will give you tears or anything, just enjoyable).

Wings were a little small in size, thats completely fine with me as i would rather take that than hormone fed gigantic wings. We had honey garlic and suicide wings(sauce on the side for this one). The honey garlic ones were okay, not amazing but not bad either, the suicide sauce was very good and very hot.

P.S the songs they play in their store is just the type i listen to, which is very uncommon lol

Good pizza, ok wings, Amazing service and good music. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Found Mr. Mike's on Yelp. Got the $35 for $20 deal. Ordered the Philly cheese steak pizza, Mexicano pizza, jerk chicken wings, gourmet fries, and garlic bread. The Philly pizza was good but loved the Mexicano pizza. The gourmet fries and jerk wings complimented each other, but the jerk is not a joke when it comes to spiciness! everything is different from your average run of the mill pizza place and goes well together.. Ordered again two days later, got the BBQ chicken poutine with saut√©ed onions, plain wings, Mediterranean pizza, jamming jerk pizza. Loved the Mediterranean and Jerk pizza's, more unique styles you can't find anywhere else and the BBQ chicken poutine was the best I've had. This place is a real Gem, Mr Mike is always there too and a real friendly guy, definitely going to keep going back, love supporting the local gems!!!"}
{"text":"I remember ordering from here before my last visit but was not entirely sure, I wanted to try a different Pizza place tired of Nova and other brands, On the way home ordered meal XL Pizza Canadian and 12 wings.

Pizza - Was amazing both the sauce and base were on point, the toppings were extremely generous.  The wings disappointed with Novas in the past as they taste weird but Mr.Mikes wings well done I dont think they are deep fried but BBQ instead. very tasty indeed.

Disappointed though that the staff did not inform that it would be better to take the meal deal for $37 instead of what i ordered. Never mind

The store is extremely clean very impressed with the place will be back I want to try the Suya next time.

However first impression was store focused on lots of different foods and worried quality would suffer definitely not the case. Thanks for the great food."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend based off an article on blogto and the raving reviews on yelp! First off, service was amazing! We met a girl who was so informative, friendly,  and welcoming ! We opted for the jerk chicken pizza and tandoori wings although we wanted everything off the menu.  The jerk chicken pizza was extremely unique the jerk flavour really came through ! Crust was thin and the tomato sauce wasn't too overpowering or sour- just perfect ! Next, the tandoori wings we had were to die for! Although a little dry the spices and flavor was exceptional! All in all great little hidden gem and would definitely recommend! Can't wait for our next visit- poutine pizza we're coming for you!"}
{"text":"This location has great service.  Unfortunately I only had the poutine. However, the poutine was great and perhaps only suggestion would be a bit less salt. Will definitely be coming back to this location."}
