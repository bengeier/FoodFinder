{"text":"My brother and I make the trek from N Scottsdale to The Drummer almost every weekend.   Jesse makes the HOTTEST suicide grilled wings on the planet - we love 'em!  Service is great and the \"regulars\" are pretty friendly too.  Drink prices are good and there are plenty of TV's.  One of the better \"dive bars\" in the area."}
{"text":"Wow..never thought there is a difference between dive bars and found out there is a big difference.  This place should be categorize as a shit bar instead of a dive bar! 

Called about 1:30 and ask about employment there and was told by some bitch working there said \"no we are not hiring\" and then with her stupid uneducated trailer trash bitch attitude ass added \"if you are in the business,  you should know not to call during lunch!\" 

Its 1:30, past lunch time \"rush\" and this bitch had to open her probably fat, pimple faced mouth and give this rude comment?! This was so uncalled for!!

So I went in this shitty place to complain (so glad I did not applied at this nasty ass place-which I did not understand why anybody else did not smell or see how nasty this place really is!) and asked for the manager. This  nasty toothless so called\"waitress\" said he was bartending and was busy! I still spoke to this (piece of shit Is way too much nice of a word for this asshole!)manager and was treated again like a piece shit and he bitched me out saying \"if you are not a customer, I don't have time for your shit and come back later!!\" 

Well the only time I would come back to this shitty bar if I ever wanted a staff infection or hepatitis from the gross bathrooms! 

How can anybody eat at a place where the management treats anyone this way??!!  I would never eat here and wouldn't anyone else eat at this place!!"}
{"text":"I go the dirty drummer burger and it was satisfactory . Their wings where bomb.com tries both the grill and original both so yummy! The happy hour special today where tacos and that was also good. I'd recommend this for good price for friends to enjoy out."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar/restaurant! We come for lunch on a frequent basis and they remember my standard order (Baja sandwich with extra crispy fries) every time. We've also had work events and our Fantasy Football draft there. They're always willing to work with us on reserving space and rearranging tables to meet our needs. $2.50 drafts at Happy Hour and great wings make for a nice evening. Also, lots of TVs for sports viewing."}
{"text":"Nice sports bar.
Love the burger and wings.
The people behind the bar (including the cook) are always nice.
Great place to catch a game.
I do wish they would have live music. It seems like it could be an awesome venue."}
{"text":"I love the Dirty Drummer, it is my neighborhood hangout and after work bar. I live a couple of blocks away so it's a great place for happy hour. I love the golden tee, and that I can always watch my teams play, but Deborah is so unprofessional and immature that I am amazed that she still has a job there. Deborah is the reason I give 4 out of 5 stars. I won't stop going here because of one person, however, she needs to tone down the whining, bitching, and moaning. On a side note, make sure you eat when Jessie is cooking! He is the best short order cook in the valley and the drummer should be proud to have him there!"}
{"text":"I usually try to visit this place on Tuesday's because their burgers are only $2.00 plus $.50 for cheese.  A basket of fries which is enough to feed 2 is only $3.00.  It can't be beat.  I usually go when I take my lunch break from work with a fellow co-worker and friend.  Another reason that I like this place is that they give you a carafe of soda so you don't run out.  They do have a decent Happy Hour which is mostly only discounts off beers.   But they are cool because they have Blue Moon on tap.  Their mixed drinks are more expense than most bars that I visit.

The regular patrons that I see in the place seem all to be retired because they are always talking about their golf game or when they are going to golf next.  When one enters the place one of the bartender's automatically know their drink and have it ready for them by the time they take a seat.  It is a pretty laid back environment 2 guys that seem to run the place are usually hanging out at the bar."}
{"text":"As I continue to try to find consistency in this mixed-up, inconsistent world of 'nowhere to get a burger and a beer' (or wine for me :) ), I came to where I know...  Where I've been since I was younger, growing up with a mom who ALWAYS says 'why not Dirty Drummer for a burger?!?!'

Moms really do know best :).  I had the best burger - cooked to perfection (Medium), and my partner Medium Well (also perfect), and great service at good ol' Dirty Drummer.  The place had a great crowd, and sports were a'plenty at their 44th St. location.  Great food, great service - Lisa was our excellent hostess with the mostess for the evening.

Char-broiled, excellent beef, melted cheese, and the most awesome fries with a crispy, light inside (complete with their signature mayo dipping sauce), is a flavor I won't soon forget or forget to repeat!  Excellent :)."}
{"text":"Had a great happy hour at the Drummer recently.  Haven't been since we moved back to AZ three years ago, and never to this location.  The wings we had grilled, they were the best ever.  Crispy and perfect, I don't like over sauced wings.  The burger were just as I remembered, cooked in wine, not such a massive burger, just the right size for me.  Decent beer selection though this is not a craft beer hangout.  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"cutomer service from staff exceptional but must say my co workers and I had at least three horrible experiences with owners and either managers or supervisors. Food is not the greatest but a heck of a deal for the specials. Would recommend getting specials because of great prices and just drink"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place i work a few stores down and they always bring our food to us. The double dipped honey hot wings are by far the best wings I've ever had"}
{"text":"Horrible service it used to be great new bartenders suck rude we used to come here often now it's time to look for another bar/dive bar DRAW 10 it is ...last time coming to this place .."}
{"text":"My fav wings!!!   Grilled and re sauced, yummmmmmm!!  
the man on the grill, Walt, sure knows what hes doin!!!"}
{"text":"woohoo! 

We always go here on Tuesdays, and sometimes on weekends.  their food is so good.  The burgers are the best in town!  And if you like wings, try their honey hots... grilled (they are not on the menu but they will make them and they are so good)

The staff is awesome, their drinks are great.   I love how they have 2 bathrooms for such a small place.  Always have music going (unless a game is on) and if the game you want to watch isn't on, they will turn it on if you ask them, and gladly do so.

We love Mandy and Brandy, And other poster is right about them greeting strangers as regulars (as we were strangers once).   

on the weekends its 5-5-5  which means 5 dollar pitchers, 5 dollar wings, and 5 dollar burger and fries:)

yummie!  love it there!  Thanks Drummer!

{"text":"This place has the feel of a place were people go to smoke and waste their life away. The atmosphere is pretty depressing and it has a thrift store feel for the interior design. Drinks and food aren't that different from Applebees down the street.  Tried going here 2x  and both experiences were similiar. I walked out more depressed, you should get the opposite feeling when walking out of a small bar, that of satisfaction.  I would recomend going here just for the experience."}
{"text":"Not my cup of tea.  Very poor service, very limited menu of deep fried and processed foods.  Frozen mozzarella sticks with canned salsa doesn't cut it when there are a plethora of fantastic Italian places around.  At least serve a halfway decent marinara like Applebee's instead of salsa...

I'm not expecting a \"gastropub\" but all the items on a sampler should not look like the same brown fried item, and I'm not sure why the waitress never seemed to care if she took orders from our table or not.  People even has to wave their hand in the air to flag a waitress down to get the bill.  Definitely a place to frequent if you \"want to be left alone\".

The music was too loud and pretty awful, while they had a strange selection of sports on their screens nearest to me: golf next to UFC!

They had a pool table which a young boy (I don't like children in bars) and a man were using.

Not somewhere I would go again on my own volition.  Drive a little further into Arcadia, Biltmore, or Uptown/Central Corridor.  Or downtown, perhaps."}
{"text":"Awesome service, delicious grilled wings. Easily a great hole-in-the-wall for anyone in the Phoenix area. There is a pool table and a wide variety of seating options. Their sandwiches are delicious as well!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by my coworker and friend.  She goes here every single day at lunch and its cute because everyone knows her there!  Anyways, everyone is very friendly!  I have always gone with my friend and each time they are so sweet and they even remembered the type of beer I like.  They have daily lunch specials and their prices are awesome!  They have a great grilled cheese!  My friend has them put their salsa inside, I like dipping it in their salsa!  I had their tacos the other day and they were pretty good!  This place is not fancy and luxurious, but I felt extremely welcome and comfortable.  This place is not my usual scene but it is good!  I will be back on many occasions...very casual!  I have never been at night or during events but I am sure it is crowded!  They have the tvs on the walls and they have pool tables I am sure it is a fun time!  Try it if you are looking for a casual bar to try..."}
{"text":"I love this little place, I've heard they had a lot of problems with the old staff but since then have gotten some great people working. They have great wings, the bartender got me hooked on grilled teriyaki ....if you are going to get them pay the extra dollar to grill them totally worth it. I'll have to go back and try a burger they looked awesome and are cooked in wine"}
{"text":"The Dirty D is awesome!!! It has a bit of a dive bar feel and great beer prices. The wings are bomb and the vibe is great. We have come several times and are never disappointed."}
{"text":"Chicken wings are chicken wings... but the Drummer will grill your wings to a delightful char after they have been fried and sauced at your request... this makes for a delicious less messy wing that is tender and juicy. These guys go through dozens of pounds a day I'm sure and each order is hot and delicious. 
The burgers are the Original Wineburger recipe used at other places around town and were directly affiliated with the old Wineburger dudes back in the day. I am amazed how much the old neighborhood has changed but looking at the drummer it is still exactly the same and just as clean as it was 30 some years ago when I first started coming. 
Plus the cutie bartender this day thinks I look like the dude. Far out man."}
{"text":"Let's be honest. You aren't going here for a 5 course meal and to have someone putting a napkin on your lap. This is a dive bar and you should go in with that mindset. Beers cold. The wings are amazing, get the buffalo style and GRILL THEM. Super delicious. The waitresses are blunt and will gladly bullshit with you. It's rarely packed so it's a great place to swing in with a group of people and know you will get a seat. I've done it since I lived in the area and always got a table"}
{"text":"The food is always delicious, the drinks a perfect. It's consistent. The place is clean, the bathrooms are well kept. The Karen's are very sweet and on top of their job. Bear makes the best Bloody Caesar in the USA!!! Been coming in to the bar for 10 years. Best grilled wings in town. Kid friendly too! It's never too loud and it's never too quiet. The atmosphere is relaxed."}
{"text":"Back for Football season due to person I was meeting lived near here. They had large pitchers of Bud Light for $6.25 and some other specials, but no food deals. Did enjoy the cheese crisp with fresh roasted green chili's for $5 and after many pitchers had a burger there. Fresh Ground beef, cooked well done (my order was the only one going) with cheese and bacon to soak up the booze. Very friendly staff throughout the PM and night games. Might not be great for watching every game, but times when there are only one or two games, it is a perfect alternative to bigger, flashier bars."}
{"text":"I was a fan of the Dirty Drummer over in Tempe back during college years at ASU. So when I walked in this location I was happy to see the faithful ASU Banner up near the bar! 

The waitress was really friendly she greeted me promptly and asked what she could get me as if I was a regular. I asked if they still did hot wings and she said why of course 12 for $5. So I ordered them and a cold draft and set back to watch the NFL game in progress. 

The game didn't go my way but the wings came out just perfect as they always have! Hot & crispy with just enough sauce to give them a little bite and not loose the crispiness of the big juicy wings. 

The beer was cold and the shoot of Tequila I had was ample to say the least. Only they don't stock my friend Jose' ...What's up with that so I had some off brand I never heard of call Tres Amigos. It was chilled to the right temperature and slid down easy. 

Can't wait to visit on a Tuesday for that burger special now. 
See ya there?"}
{"text":"wife and i were out for a couple beers and food on saturday went to the 44st location never again food took for ever and there was nobody in bar,wings under cooked, bar tender was terrible no personality at all hard to get service when she is looking at her phone, only thing good was waitress, live in the neighborhood lot of places to choose from probably last time there to bad like to support the locals"}
{"text":"I've been to this establishment several times after work with coworkers. I've always ordered the chicken wings, which are phenomenal! They fry them, then throw them on the grill (for an extra couple of bucks). I went against my better judgement and ordered a medium-well, cheese drummer burger. It was the size of a case dollar, cooked well-done...to a crisp. The unmelted cheese looked as if it had been sitting in the fridge, unwrapped for weeks. But I was told that this was the normal look of the burger. If mom ever told me to say grace, now was the time. The meal turned out to be filling... Or I wasn't as hungry as I proclaimed to be. Previous service had always been rude, slacking, and non-existing. This visit, it was different. The waitress was friendly and attentive although she was working the whole dining area alone. There are TVs throughout the place, so you'll never miss the game. Also, you can try your hand at pool or sit and people watch. Nice place to regroup after a long day of work."}
{"text":"I work in the building across the street and have gone here for lunch too many times to count.  If I didn't work in the building across the street I doubt I would have ever gone into this corner building, strip mall, dive bar unless something horrific was happening in the world, such as the zombie apocalypse, one in which I'm being chased by a hoard and my only salvation is to enter a dive bar where, more than likely, the servers will also be zombies and I'll be fucked pretty bad. 

That said, the place kind of smells like musk and sadness and the two or three middle aged servers look like they've lived a lot of life.  There are always a few hunched over dudes at the bar, watching sports or maybe counting their misfortunes.  One server appears to have always just had something weird or traumatic happen to her before she takes our order, like she was just bitching at SRP for shutting her power off or she just found out her teenage son got arrested on drug charges- then she comes to take our order.  While the service has never been despicable, we always have to wait an unnecessary amount of time for our tab, which sucks since we're anxious to get back to our meaningless jobs.

She also asks us \"what flavor\" of beer we want, which confused me since, like, Blue Moon is not exactly a \"flavor\" as much it is, you know, a brand.  But I can look past this.  

I've eaten a few things here and the worst and most unacceptable was a simple dinner salad which was literally wilted Iceburg, bag lettuce with an obscene amount of dressing.  I can only assume that they thought if they covered the wilted lettuce with enough fatty Ranch I wouldn't notice the lettuce was bad.  I did, but I didn't send it back, instead I ate it and drank beer and talked about how much better the director's cut of Bladerunner is. 

The wings are mediocre, not crispy enough for me to say they're cooked well, not thick enough to call them plump, and not tasty enough to assume that the sauce is anything more than some Frank's Red Hot concoction with some added butter or someshit.

I've also had the pleasure of the chicken \"fritters\" which are, you know, frozen chicken strips deep fried.  I order these most times I come here because they can't really fuck it up and you can't exactly go wrong with chicken strips.  I've also ordered the \"fire\" fries which are just their fries with Cayenne pepper on them, and they charge another 1.50 for this. 

What IS worth the trip across the way and the shady, low brow atmosphere are the two dollar burgers on Tuesdays.  I actually never order the burgers only because I'm not much of a burger person, but my regular co-workers tell me they're tasty, a cut above a fast food burger and cheaper.  (Though, consider that you're also leaving a tip for the service, not getting fries, and paying extra for cheese, so it's not THAT much of a better deal than fast food, just sayin'.) 

What I can't look past, why Dirty Drummer is only getting two stars, is the fact that the only reason we came here; the five dollar pitchers of domestics, are now, for some reason, NINE dollar pitchers which, needles to say, is absolutely not worth it, especially considering the skimpy size of the pitchers, the depressing atmosphere and the tore up servers.  After my co-worker noticed this new four dollar addition to the pitcher price he said, rather cleverly, \"looks like this is the last time we'll be drumming.\"

And it was."}
{"text":"\"Amazing, life-altering\" wings, states Robby \"Wings for the Table\" McHarris. If there's a man that can guide his people toward the promised land of wings, it's McHarris. Go for it. Order a pitcher. Play a round of pool. Have a fun experience at the bar and order those wings that we, and especially he, come back for every March. 5.5 stars. 

FYI - no bathroom stall door. But, who cares. You don't need one when you have access to those incredible wings."}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was 20.. I'm now..... Yeah nice try. The grilled wings have always been the best ever."}
{"text":"The wings awe amazing. Make sure to get them double dipped! (It's fried wings, dipped then grilled then dipped again) BUT that beijg said, their take out is horrendous. They'll quote you 20min. Don't show up for 45 min to an hour because that's how long your order will take to be ready. Third time in a row that happened. I walked in at the 20 min mark as the cook was putting my wings into the fryer. Half an hour later, after sitting there my order was finally ready."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The food is 5 stars it's best and it's not even a fancy restaurant. I love the cheap drinks, atmosphere, staff and the fact that you get to watch them prepare your food in front of you"}
{"text":"It's a dive bar.  They have lots of TVs to watch sports.  They have a few pool tables.  The grill and fryer are in the bar area so the cook and bartender kind of share the space back there.   I was there on a weekday late at night and I would say that 80% of the customers were Hispanic and every customer except me had visible tattoos.  However this didn't bother me at all as I knew it was a dive bar before I came there.  Nobody caused any problems when I was there.   I also noticed a bunch of baseball memorabilia around the place and signs advertising for weekly appearances by various historical baseball players who presumably sell autographs and other personalized merchandise.

The drinks were cheap and the service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Great happy hour for domestic drinks. Typical bar food menu. Service is slow but very friendly"}
{"text":"They gave the most delicious grilled wings! My favorite are Teriyaki flavor :) 
Many tv's everywhere you look for sports! Great music Box with lots & lots of selections of songs!
New review- 30 yrs and going strong! Food is just as delicious, I kid you not the best wings! But get them grilled even better!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here last night with the fetching fiancee for a couple of beers and to watch the Dbacks and Monday Night Football simultaneously. We're both fans of little dive neighborhood bars, and this one fit the bill. Lots of TVs all showing games, and a bunch of beers on draft and in bottles.

We didn't eat. We just drank some beer. The beer was fresh and our bartender, Nicole, was VERY friendly and outgoing. We noticed they had a couple of pool tables, so we mosied over and played a half dozen games. The coin-op pool table worked fine (always something of a question in a dive bar) and the bar cues weren't too horrible. And there was extra entertainment from the pool table next to us, where one guy was an unrelenting and shameless self-promoter.

This place is a sausage fest, at least during Monday Night Football. I think the bartender, the server, and my fiancee were the only women in the place. Lots of guys watching the football game and making some harmless noise.

This is not a place for snobs. It's a little neighborhood bar, not a \"destination\" bar. It's great for watching games, drinking beer and shooting pool with your neighbors. If your favorite bar is Hanny's, you're probably not going to like the Dirty Drummer. If you're more of a Zipps person, you'll fit right in.

As we were paying the bill, we introduced ourselves to Nicole (the bartender) and she was kind enough to run down their weekly food and drink specials for us. Overall, a fine first experience. We'll go back."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my boyfriend, and we plan to frequent this place more often. It is a low-key and dim establishment, which is ideal for introverts such as myself. The food is quite delicious as well. I had the fish and chips special, and goddamn, it was exceptional. The crust was crispy and fresh (obviously not over-fried) and the fish was tender and flaky. The fries were delicious as well; seasoned perfectly with the ideal balance of crispy and soft textures. My boyfriend got their wings, and they were quite yummy, though I am not a wing-person, so I am probably undermining the quality of the dish. I really enjoyed the casual atmosphere, and there are plenty of televisions and brews for sports fans."}
{"text":"Fabulous honey-hot wings, get them grilled; it's worth the extra money! My Philly  cheesesteak sandwich was very good and everything was well seasoned. Only reason I didn't give them a five was because they're slow, but was worth the wait and staff is very friendly!"}
{"text":"I don't know if I have ever been to paradise, but the Dirty Drummer has got to be as close as you can get.   With great service, amazing atmosphere, and chicken wings that the almighty would love it's no wonder it's an oasis in the desert."}
{"text":"I wasn't very impressed with servers and its looks like this bar was make for the  old generations. One of the server was eating right up at the bar. In my option that unprofessional. I pry wouldn't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great dive bar...the service is good.  As soon as we sat down the server came right over and asked for our order.  The drinks were out quickly and so was our food.  They have $2 burgers on Tuesdays.  The decor itself is nothing to rave about, but it's a nice neighborhood place."}
{"text":"I have no idea why some of these people rate it so low. I discovered the Drummer about 6 weeks ago. It's clean, great food, & friendly people. The cook makes everything in front of you (If your sitting at the bar). Great drink specials, televisions everywhere, a juke box you can play from your phone (via an app), pool, darts, those stupid golf video games.....truthfully everything you want in a bar. Oh and if you go, get the wings and opt for them to be grilled too....holy smokes are they good. 

My one beef with the place, is they don't have the Boxing/UFC events. Hopefully that changes soon.

Signed,
A Double D Regular :)"}
{"text":"What can I say about the Dirty Drummer, been coming here on and off since 1980 when we all came over from Fedmart.  Great happy hour. My favorite are the grilled wings \"honey hot\" great people you get to know."}
{"text":"Very clean establishment, service was excellent. I would definitely come back again. In a strip mall by Costco and really a hidden gem.  Had some fried zucchini which was yummy. Need to go back and try some more items. Definitely recommend this place. Go try it out."}
{"text":"Good little dive bar for sure. I stopped in for lunch and since it was Tuesday the burgers are only $2.00. I had a 1/3 burger with Swiss and added Green Chili to it. It was very tasty for $2.00. I also added a side of fried zucchini and those were amazing! They were cooked perfectly and was served with a side of ranch dressing. 

Service was friendly and very quickly. I could have been in and out in 30 minutes but I took my time since I wasn't in a huge rush. Even though they were quick on the service they didn't rush you in anyway which was nice.

Overall, everything was very good and I will certainly go back for lunch."}
{"text":"Love Dirty Drummer! Been 11 years! Tebra is my favorite waitress and Jessie is my favorite cook. I'm biased! Just because they know what I love. The wings and burgers are incredible. Would love the $5-$5-$5 deal and $2 Burgers in July, again! Owners are cool and love sports. Pretty easy to talk to everyone here. Family atmosphere."}
{"text":"If you like a good old fashioned dive bar then the dirty drummer is the place to go. 
Plenty of parking available around the building so even when it's busy it's not too hard to find a space.
The chicken wings are great, but make sure you ask them the lightly grill them, that way they are not smothered in the sauce of your choosing, I chose the honey hot grilled chicken wings with ranch dip and they didn't disappoint, very moist and tender and the perfect amount of honey hot sauce on them.
We ordered 4 drinks each between 2 of us 4 buds and 4 tall vodka diets and the amazing grilled wings, our check only came to $34.
The servers are attentive and alert and are more than happy to see you get what you ask for. 
I can see this place becoming a regular Friday hot spot for us, very close to us, cheap as chips and a good atmosphere what more do you need."}
{"text":"I love this place.. it's a hole in the wall but great food and great people. I always order the dozens of flats grilled..jessie really knows how to make my wings just right!  I take muy hitls here and we orfer the wings \" flats\" grilled with a side of ranch and hot sauce.  The only thing is that i go at least 2 or 3 times a weeks so i consider myself a regular.  But still i get charge a 1.00$ for each ranch and hot sauce. You would think i would get a discount or get a big side  to share for all 3 of us for a $1.00 instead of a dollar for each extra side order which adds up ."}
{"text":"Just like I remember from many decades ago. Some of the best wings out there. What is in the blue cheese. WOW. Whole chunks of salty yummyness. Alittle of a dive but who cares. Spot on waitress that was all over our table."}
{"text":"Great staff and good food, don't change a thing!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with the Mesa Dirty Drummer on Country Club about 20 years back. When a friend moved to Avondale the 44th & Oak location became our central meeting spot and eatery.

Same great prices. The Country Club location has better food quality than 44th. Still good, but while Country Club knocks it out of the park, 44th makes it almost to 3rd then runs back to 2nd. 

A little history: for a while I had trouble with a specific cook at 44th named Walt. This is years ago, he's gone now... I think. But time and time again he would overcook my medium burger to well done. It was killin' me. It got to the point that I would ask if Walt is at the grill. If he was I would ask for rare and request the server really stay on him about it. Because Walt would cook the hell out of a Rare burger too.

This Drummer is a bit upscale from the Country Club location and about half again the size. The burgers are good and the service is feel-good personable here too. You're in for tasty food and a great time.

I get the Cheese Drummer with Bacon.They put a little port wine on the meat during the cooking process. It really make a difference. Also, we typically share a side of crisp tasty fries and usually some wings.

Check out me review of the Country Club location if you make over to the East side."}
{"text":"Love this place, good food and there is a waitress named Mia in there that is nice to look at. And by nice I mean it's the main reason we go in there other then the food is great. All in all Mia is sexy and the food is good."}
{"text":"Burger was burnt to a crisp both times when I wanted a medium. I'll eat well done but when it's quite literally charcoal on both sides, I'll be a bit sad and disappointed. Cheapish tough? I'll give it another try but cook did not do a good job"}
{"text":"Haven't even tried the food yet! The waitress however has been absolutely amazing in catering to my needs. 

I will try to make a long story short here.. Delayed flight, made it to Phoenix couple hours late, lost bag, found bag, bag missing half my stuff, got in a fight over a cabi trying to rip me off. End of story I just really wanted a few drinks and to go back to my room. The waitress quickly served me my shots and beer as well as my food to go. Even helped me out with some beer to go \" unopened \" of course at an amazing price to go back to my room with. \"Walking\". 


I don't care if the food is horrible they helped end a terrible day good. However I hear the food is amazing!

edit: food was amazing. Fire fries were magical"}
{"text":"Never going back!!! I just experience the worst customer service in my life. This bar has been one of my dad's favorite bar/restaurant. We decided to go to dad's favorite restaurant to spend a good family time. The waitress that was asign to us had a very nasty attitude to begin with. As we were walking out she came out to the door and yelled \"if you are not going to give a good tip don't come back!!!!\" My dad always spends minimum $100 every time he comes to this restaurant and for a waitress to yell that infront of other customers is totally wrong. I mean do you really have to leave a good tip when someone is providing poor customer service? Very unprofessional. If you are looking to spend a good time with good customer service this is not the place. After reviewing several reviews i came to find out we are not the first customers that have experience something similar. Good food but very poor customer service due to that server."}
{"text":"How in the hell do this place charge for take out..... The food sucks, you should check the out if you like under cooked food. Had to select a star but I give this place a 0 for sure"}
{"text":"The place was super chill and that's probably why I'm giving it 4 stars.

However, the food took like ALL OF MY LIFE to get here and there werent many people there!

I ordered the wings...and my boo ordered the grilled cheese. After all that wait, the food wasn't extraordinary and my wings were a little burnt and dry. But after asking for some extra wing sauce, it was yummy. 

HOWEVER...I would definitely come here again because it would be a good place to watch any sports games."}
{"text":"I'm a hot wing fanatic and heard that Dirty Drummer does good wings, so I gave them a shot and basically they were just ok. The sauce was thin, vinegary and forgettable but the wings were meaty. The beer selection itself was poor, mostly cheap stuff like bud light, michelob ultra, etc. The deep fried mushrooms appetizer was pretty good, and the service was good.

But overall it was simply ok, I wouldn't insist on going here but I wouldn't rule it out either. I guess I went in expecting something more interesting instead of a half assed sports bar."}
{"text":"Great dive bar/restaurant. They have great burgers and wings. Highly suggest getting a dozen double dipped hot wings. They grill the wings then dip them back in the sauce. Perfect place to watch your local teams play and they turn up the volume for all local teams."}
{"text":"I like how accommodating they were for a large group of 12. We came after work on a Friday and they were very helpful putting some tables together for us. I had a couple happy hour drinks and then we all ordered dinners. I had the Friday fish fry... very good included hush puppies too but I don't eat the fries. Classic neighborhood Sports Bar... how can you not have fun? Easy parking too you can come in the front or the back."}
{"text":"Would come here after softball with some coworkers. Place has really good songs, chicken fingers, cheap beer pitchers, good service. Not the prettiest place, but still great when just grabbing something from a type of sports grill."}
{"text":"I guess you can certainly do worse.. , after awhile all these shitholes look the same to me, I go for the experience of talking to the locals, and , on this day my better half and I were the only 2 customers in this place. We had a serviceable Philly Cheese Steak. Prices are average I guess. And I have to give it one star for the stupid name."}
{"text":"There is nothing fancy about this place at all, but it is perfect if you want to get a great burger...$2.00 on Tuesdays and all summer long...great wings $5.00 for a dozen any time....Cold cheap beer $5.00 for a pitcher, also any time, all coupled with good, friendly service. They also get the NFL Sunday Ticket and MLB Extra Innings package so you can check out your favorite out of market teams. If you want good food/beer at decent prices give the Dirty Drummer a shot."}
{"text":"I don't really expect much from a bar & grill and I guess that's what I got. I can't eat much and bread is off the menu. I asked for a simple hamburger patty, but the told me that I would have to pay for a whole burger with the fixings anyway. Well, okay fine. Since I'm just eating the patty I'm hoping it's nice and juicy medium as ordered. What I got was a charred hockey puck.

I also got an order of fried zucchini. I expect it to be frozen stuff, but this was pretty bad and grease soaked.

I realize they don't start off with super good ingredients, but they could have cooked it better and brought it out faster being that the place was dead on a late Friday night.

BTW, I cannot figure out why two reviews are filtered. They seem on the up and up. The food service is painfully slow.  This is a place for beer and sports."}
{"text":"One of my favorite little spots to go to! The food and drinks are very good (wings and Long Islands are regulars for me). Jeanine was a server there the first two years I start going, and she was the best one, hands down. Unfortunately, she is no longer there :( Needless to say, the customer service slightly shifted. I go about once a week, and I am usually unlucky enough to always get the same rude, snappy, uninterested server. (Older, tall blonde lady) I brought in a friend of mine once, because I bragged so much about the place. Well, little Mrs. Rude was her normal nasty self, and we ended up leaving before ordering. If it wasn't for her, I would definitely rate it 5 stars. I'll see you this weekend, Rudey, McRuderton!!!"}
{"text":"We went here to watch a hockey game last week for the first time. The service was a little slow but also very polite and thorough. Of course we had to try the famous grilled wings and we were not disappointed!!!! We got the bbq and the hot style to share. I thought the hot style tasted the best.GET THE GRILLED WINGS!!!! You won't be disappointed. Pictures next time. I ate them all before thinking to take a picture."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to stop in for lunch after a coworker talked me into going.  I always avoided going because everyone told me that you go in,  eat and come out smelling like grease.  Also they kept referring to it as the dirty dungeon.  So I thought ill give them a chance to disprove what I was told. 
First impression when stepping inside,  empty,  not as dark as I imagined not too bad.  Next checked out menu,  not a whole lot of selections to choose from that isn't fried.  Also very overpriced.  I'm sure they may be struggling for business and had to raise prices, but... you better have some awesome food for the prices.   I ended up ordering a hot dog with sauerkraut, a side of fries and a soft drink and a side of ranch. Hotdog was a Hebrew national beef,  fries were crinkle cut,  lemonade may have been running out of syrup. I think two things are a complete turn off for me,  the wait for the food was ridiculous I'm guessing 20 minutes and the prices.   I tried to come up with a work around for future orders to keep supporting this local business but when I asked if they offered pick up orders she said yes but they charge a fee for that.  Well I guess I'll have to walk to Costco for a Hebrew national and a soda for 1.50.  The bill was the deciding factor,  15.00 before tip.  My co-worker only had wings and a soft drink theirs was 16.00 before tip. I just don't see the point of returning since service was ok,  wait too long and food was ok.  If you are the owner please improve service times and stop charging 1.00 for ranch and 3.50 for a soft drink.  I'll give 3 stars because I truly like to support local business, I hope they improve some of these (reoccurring  issues)  as I read in others reviews as well.  Thanks"}
{"text":"Watched the super bowl here with the family !!' They let us reserve the best table in the place .  The wings and French fries were hot and served fast despite the large crowd .. they also offered a free buffet all the way up until the third quarter then they opened up the pool tables .... this is and will be our super bowl spot"}
{"text":"Its was Saturday night a few minutes before 12:00am and called to see if they were serving food. Was told we were 2 minutes late even though it advertised they are open till 1:00am. You would think Fridays and Saturdays they would serve till 1:00am. But a block up the street Applebee's is open for late night happy hour with half price appetizers and the place was busy. I like to patronize local business. But in this case Applebee's out did a old establishment"}
{"text":"Amazing service! Angie is incredible! Great food... try the wings! This place is a little hidden but worth the search!"}
{"text":"Local sports pub with the best chicken wings around town. We actually live in Houston but everytime we fly to Phoenix we make it a point to stop by and see Bear. 
I truly love this local pub... you guys rock. We will miss you and see ya next time we are in Phoenix!

{"text":"A clean dive bar neatly disguised as a sports bar.  Its both really, plenty of sports on all of the 9 or 10 tvs and killer wings.  Hint-try em grilled.  Not the cheapest food, but beer/well prices are very decent plus they keep bottled beer in a big bin of ice.  Nice in the AZ heat!  The food is really good bar food, for a reasonable price.  Couple pool tables and golden tee game, plenty of nice booths, small patio out front and an entrance around back.  Parking is simple.  Good place to go for a few cold ones and a burger or some wings, day or night.  

I almost forgot to mention, the kitchen is all right behind the bar, so you can see your food being prepared,  and in a good way."}
{"text":"wings and burgers are the best! of course  dave and jeff always make you feel welcome! dont miss the drummer"}
{"text":"If I could give it less I would.  LOUSY service.  They are not busy and waited 45 minutes for a burger.  Ordered chili and got none.  Would never recommend"}
{"text":"I'm glad I came across this place!!!!!
Great food and the staff is amazing as well. 
I'm from Oklahoma and hope I can come back out and eat here again."}
{"text":"This was totally our after work hang out.  On a rough day, it might be the \"lunch\" for some.  As long as you could walk over and walk back, which we did, you were good.  

I was surprised by their food.  They aren't going to win any gourmet awards or anything, but it was pretty good for bar food.  And they had some good weekly specials.  They also did regular Texas Hold em Tournaments which were fun to watch.  Small neighborhood spot.  Great service.  Good drink prices.  And for some of us - great memories.  (Shout out to my Synergy Homies!)"}
{"text":"If you want a local spot that feels like what you see in on Cheers this should you be your new home. Hands down my favorite local spot to catch a bite have a beer or just relax. All the bartenders (Sal Kayla)  and cooks(both Jessie's) I interact with are great. Friendly fast fun to talk to . Yes some of the tvs are older and the spot has a feel like its stuck inthe 80s but thats ok. Great energy. They have regulars who have been coming since hte 80s and before. I even have sat next a man who is over 90 and still sits up at the bar. 

I know all the daily food specials. I think Thursday tacos are one of the most popular. wednesday is chicken sandwich. tuesday is burger. monday is chefs choice. friday is fish fry(the onlyone I've never had) .

They are know for their wings and I love them. I usually get bbq hot grilled. The hot is a mixture of franks red hot butter and maybesomething else. For me its too salty alone so the bbq offsets that. I prefer them grilled so I pay the extra dollar. Burgers are cooked made to order and are quite popular as well. They cook them with some house redwine and it adds falvor to it without being overpowering. 

They have a about 6 or 7 beers on tap. Not quite as cold as Applebees draft beers but not bad. Quite a bit of bottled selection including some craft beer cans as well. Reasonably priced beers and liquor is pretty average price for the area. Very casual environment. Pool tables a about 10 tvs. Most are high def flatscreens but a few older rear projection widescreens as well.They do put the sound for the local games on weekends and during the week the jukebox plays through the speakers. 


Overall my great local dive bar anytime of day."}
