{"text":"Been here several times in the past few weeks. Originally went on the recommendation of a friend. Food and service have been consistently good. Plenty of tvs for game watching. Good atmosphere for kids. Have had everything from the wings to the salads and burgers. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"I go to this place often with my boyfriend. Tonight was not quite up to par. We walk into the restaurant with no welcome from the two hostess to our left. Minus one star. I didn't feel welcomed. We look for spots at the bar for first come first serve seating. Our server was helpful and polite. Answered questions my boyfriend and I had. Took a while to get our drinks from the bar. But it was a little busy at the bar so I understand. I ordered a Caesar salad which was pretty good starter before my fish tacos. Fish tacos were pretty good too. The fries that came on the side though we're like heaven to me. Nice and crispy, had a nice crunch. Fried pickles with ranch are awesome. Can't get enough of those!"}
{"text":"Worst  bar in Charlotte. ....I will dispute any charges since the service was not provided for"}
{"text":"I've been driving past this place to and from work for what seems forever - finally stopped in for the first time last night.  The sheltered nature of the outdoor patio made it comfortable to sit outside even on a cool night.  (I won't be redundant about the wrought iron chairs!)  Place was busy on a Wednesday night - always a good sign - with a lot of what appeared to be office work attire on the patrons.  Bad first omen - no draught beer!!  Seriously, are you even allowed to call yourself a bar if you only serve bottled beer?  Or perhaps this place is trying to stand out from all the rest serving the micro-brew de jour on tap?  So the beer is a definite opportunity for improvement.  The food on the other hand was plentiful, tasty and satisfying.  The fried pickles were a bit too spicy for my companion but I thought they were great.  Burgers are not as good as The Liberty but they aren't as pricey either.  Overall, nice value for price paid.  By the time we'd finished our meal, space had opened up on the comfy sofa nearest the fireplace.  Gas log I believe but with the wood stacked on either side, you could convince yourself it's real.  So one more drink, fabulous company, good conversation on the patio near the fireplace - and I was late getting home!  Our server said they are opening another location in Weddington.  Maybe draught beer at this location - please????"}
{"text":"Went to Char bar for the first time this week.  It was delicious! We started with fried pickles that were irresistible. I had the southwestern burger and my boyfriend had the NY strip. Both were excellent. You can tell they don't use cheapy meat in their burgers. I also had one of their signature cocktails (a couple of them actually) which were tasty but not weak. Definitely two thumbs up :) the food beat all expectations. Bravo!"}
{"text":"My wife flew in late that evening and we were looking for some where that was open and could sit down to eat. Char Bar 7 is open til midnight during the week. This place didn't catch me as a \"final destination\" type of place but rather a \"it's getting late. What's open that's not fast food\" type of place. I thought the burger was decent but my wife thought the seasoning on the fries were the best part. Like I said, I'd come back, but won't make a special trip in deciding what we want for dinner."}
{"text":"The environment is extremely loud and the meals are rarely cooked as ordered and are way overpriced. Several times there was all we could take."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out at 10pm on a Tuesday.  Menu online was not impressive but thought meh,  let's try it out.  First off,  where the hell is the front door?  Are you supposed to just know where it is?  All signage was covered by the patio winter walls.  Kitchen closed at 10 but the bar is open til midnight  -  WTF????  NOT impressed,  won't be going back. Sorry this not even worth a star."}
{"text":"The food is average, nothing spectacular.  Service was horrible, our waitress was too busy talking to her boyfriend to notice that we had been waiting for our check over 15 minutes, which, by the way, was brought by another waitress.  Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now. I've had various dishes. The good: The bar has good drinks and specials. It's near my house.  Service is fine. The bad: It's very expensive given the food options. It's $12.75 for a French Dip! I'm not stingy. I'll pay for good food but it isn't even that good. I think it's popular because there are not a lot of options in the immediate vicinity. If more restaurants were to move in, they'd be in trouble.   I've had their wings, burgers, chopped steak, salmon, and other sandwich dishes. Tonight I had the chopped steak for the first time and it was disgusting! It was full of grease and the \"jus\" as they called it was a gravy that tastes as if it had soured. I've given as many chances as I'm going to give this place. I might return for a cocktail but I'm not going to give anymore money for the terrible food here. It's too bad because it could be better."}
{"text":"Good food but lame atmosphere. It's dark and very loud. Lots of television. Sometimes they don't have the patio open.   I never get a burger from this place but I know that's what they're known for. Everyone I've ever gone with has loved their burgers. I get the black bean burger and it's amazing. I've also never been disappointed with my side dishes!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The burgers are great, the steaks are amazing and the beer lineup is great. CB7 sauce is quite tasty as well.  The prices are much lower than you would expect them to be for the quality of the product.  CharBar has exceptional service with very personable wait staff.  One of the coolest things is the sweet front patio where there is a wood burning fireplace and many fans to extend the outdoor dining season in both directions. There are huge, comfortable couches around the fireplace. Also they've got a huge garage door for a front wall that can be opened on good days for an outdoor experience.  I'd go back tomorrow"}
{"text":"Burgers here were really great. We have the CB7 as well as the smokehouse burger and it was tough for us to really judge which one was better. The onion rings are to die for their hand breaded and they come with the special sauce that really was good. They have drink specials every night, and the waitstaff has been exceptionally friendly."}
{"text":"Above-average pub fair is how I would describe the menu.  Good beer selection with many local options.  I've been twice and have had a great experience both times.  Decent bar area, dining room, and outdoor patio.  Lot's of televisions if you're trying to catch a game.  If you like your wings sweet/smoky I would highly recommend the Bourbon Chipotle wings done charred (it's a dollar extra but worth it).  They are on point and perfect with a beer.  I originally got that recommended to me by the bartender. I definitely will be going back.  I don't know how this place gets bad reviews!"}
{"text":"I had the best Ahi Tuna salad yet.  My husband had smokehouse burger and sweet potato tots and he loved it.  Our waitress Rhett was awesome.  Great place. Great atmosphere. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just had lunch there.  Had the steak salad.  The waitress was very accommodating for a few changes to the item.  I have been here twice now & will be back."}
{"text":"Just okay, nothing special. Since we live real close by and we wanted to get something to go, we ordered take out here this evening. My wife looked at the online menu and picked out a wedge salad and was satisfied. When she was looking at the menu the image at the top is of some great looking onion rings and I thought I would like to have those as a side. I went to the restaurant to order and found out they don't have onion rings. Seems a bit strange the only image above the online menu is of something they don't even have available. I ordered a burger, specifically the Smokehouse Burger that costs $1 more than the basic burger. I ordered the Smokehouse because it came with onion strings on top - or at least that's what the menu says. I get home and find out there are no onion strings on top. Now I know they have them because I saw another dish coming out with onion strings.   Burgers seem to be somewhat of a specialty here so one would think that they would have decent fries. Unfortunately the fries are likely just frozen fries like you get in a plastic bag at the supermarket. Although the burger was pretty good, it's too bad they can't make fresh cut fries like some other places in the same price range do. When eating something that's really not so good for you, at least it should taste good."}
{"text":"My family and I were excited to try Char Bar No 7 for the first time. We walked in and requested to be seated by the outside covered patio. The patio has a warm cozy fireplace. As we got seated we noticed that our table area seemed too dark. So I went up to the front and asked the hostess if we can change seats to another table that it was a little bigger, but had better lighting. She told me no because that specific table had more seats and they save it for large group of customers. Then, my husband noticed his seat was sticky, so we had to request a different chair. Finally our food comes out.I had ordered black chickened nachos. The nachos were cold and I felt like I was eating cold queso cheese with cold chicken. It was not good at all. Finally I had enough of eating cold nachos that I requested for them to just bring me a plate of nachos with warm cheese. They apologized, but never removed the fee from my check. I shouldn't be telling them to remove the fee. The manager should understand that customer service is important. Even after suggesting to fix my meal, they should go out of their way and not charge me. I come there and pay for my service. Otherwise, the waitress was nice and they had live music that we enjoyed listening to. I don't think will be back though:) Ohhhh, the whole time that we were there no one came to sit at that table that had more seats."}
{"text":"Not impressed and poor service. More detailed review to come.......  So now that I have time, here goes....Seemed pretty busy for a Sunday night, very loud inside. I ordered the CB7 burger, Husband ordered the Leap year burger, and daughter ordered regular burger. We also ordered the fried pickles, sauce was good but they were pickle spears fried, not a lot of breading, very sour tasting. I wish the menu had been more descriptive. We also ordered the pretzles, but i never got to even taste them, devoured before I had a chance. The waitress, Ally according to my receipt, was not very attentive. My drink never got refilled once, husband had an Oberon, glass was empty, never stopped or asked if we wanted another. My daughter did get a refill. I was drinking tea, she had coke. There was a guy walking back and forth all night inside to outside, I am guessing the manager. He was a tall black guy,I stopped him at one point and asked for a to go box for the burger for our dogs. No one ever came over to ask how was everything, they seemed very understaffed. The menu was overpriced, and the burger was not great.  Another point, we asked for extra napkins, for our food, someone brought us 3 cocktail napkins. We won't be back, and if I'm in the mood for a burger, I'll go to 5 Guys."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! Surprisingly placed in a shopping center...we believed this would be another Applebee's. Boy we were wrong! They hand make their burgers, and they hand cut their delicious salmon! Our service was excellent, we had Bea or Beatrice. Such a sweetheart and so attentive, the managers know how to pick their staff!"}
{"text":"Five stars for service alone!  Our waitress was right there when we needed her and invisible when we didn't.  First time here so menu was overwhelming.  Finishing off a $2.00 Miller Lite cleared the mind and palate.  All burgers are $7.00 on Mon nite and hubster really enjoyed his naked burger - think he secretly just liked ordering it by name -  I ordered sirloin salad and was good - not the best I have ever had - needed more \"green\" in it for me rather than white iceberg.  But sirloin was med rare as ordered and quite tender.  Fried pickles were the bomb!  Left little room for dessert and that was a bad decision.  Red velvet cake our waitress brought around for us to drool over had my name all over it - but maybe next time and there will definitely be a next time."}
{"text":"A coworker and I were just looking for a place to grab a beer and watch the start of March madness. We were pleasantly surprised as neither of us had been to Char Bar 7 before. This place has a great vibe with great food. The wings are tasty and my burger was delicious. Good looking crowd on this particular Thursday night, too. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Until now, you had to leave Mint Hill to get this level of great, upscale food and drinks in a wonderfully cozy, energetic, casual, cleverly-designed, contemporary atmosphere with a sports bar overtone. That pretty much covers it but for details, keep reading.   For our first visit on opening day, we expected some operational hiccups but it was really good. Service was friendly and prompt. Food was hot and delicious for three out of three entrees. Wait staff was in control and management was always visible and mingling.   This place has done a masterful job of integrating the indoor/outdoor bar and dining experience with large, open glass garage doors that lead out to a hard-covered roof/patio.   There are three large fireplaces in a single stone chimney wall surrounded by a large casual seating area. On either side of that, there are outdoor, candle-lit dining areas. This side of the building faces Matthews Mint Hill Road so there's a really nice energy out there. There are TVs scattered throughout the space but it's done tastefully and doesn't look like Buffalo Wild Wings collided with the NASA control center.  Sound level - If you're a little more conservative and tend to be somewhat of a stick in the mud, the noise level might be a little high for you. That said, it was easy to have conversation at our table despite the infectiously eclectic background music and crowd noise.   Personally, I thought it was wonderfully appropriate."}
{"text":"I've been going to wing night (Thursday) the last couple of years with a few friends. The service has slowly declined, even when the traffic at the restaurant is average.  For starters, The last 2 times, we have waited 20min+ just to get our first round of drinks, which have been wrong. On top of that, the wait for apps and dinner compiles to about an hour and isn't very smooth.  The quality of wings has been one of my favorites in Charlotte area behind moosehead and providence road sundries up until recently. Not sure if they switched cooks or how their kitchen operates on a daily basis, but clearly something has been off.   It is safe to say, we will be taking an indefinite break from wing night at Char Bar. 0 stars would be applicable to most recent visit."}
{"text":"Food was good the service was not. I wish they could find the same consistency in the front of the house they have in the back"}
{"text":"Wide variety of burger choices. It was very busy and the waiter wasn't very good. The food was ok, but not amazing. Pretty average. Service was extremely slow. Haven't gone back."}
{"text":"Football Sunday and there's not much of a crowd.  Good news for me when I get pick of the tables to watch all 5 million of their TVs and ALL the games!  We got half order of nachos, which would have been very yummy but those chips were so over salted they were hard to eat.  i made a mention of it to our server, but our table was STARVING and did not want to wait for another batch to be made.  Our table had a steak (I'm not a huge fan of red meat, but he enjoyed it and I took a bite - it was well cooked), the Charleston burger with pilaf, and another burger.   it's apparent the cooks are not tasting their our dishes because if the nachos were beyond over salted, the pilaf had zero flavor.  The pilaf I actually sent back for the tater tots I should have gotten in the first place.  Overall, it was a good experience, decent bar food, plenty of football games and relatively close enough to my home that I would come back."}
{"text":"We find ourselves coming here almost weekly now.  The food is excellent, with a number of choices.  We appreciate the consistency.  Service is excellent. If anything, I wish they had a roasted chicken entree.  They also have fabulous desserts. The John Daily cocktail is fantastic."}
{"text":"The food was good. We have been to the Matthews location a couple of times and had good experiences. We wanted to wait a couple weeks to see how well they could replicate this experience before making a judgment. Unfortunately, they have a long way to go.  We went twice to the new CharBar7 in MInt Hill after looking forward to it and viewing the construction process. Seems like it should be a good addition to MInt Hill.   The primary issue we had was the NOISE !  If this is a sports and loud music bar, they should label it as such. We never had the loud and constant noise levels we did on both of our visits. To be fair, the noise on Saturday was more bearable than Monday (Labor Day). Since they had football games on the TV and some had the sound up, the music was apparently turned off. This was a blessing. But still quite loud, but bearable. Monday we went early, around 4:15 pm on the holiday. It was not as crowded and we were seated quickly. Then we waited over ten minutes before anyone even bothered to offer us water or welcome us. Obviously they have some work to do in training the wait staff. A lady manager or someone who looked like a manager walks around trying to look busy but just basically walks around and does nothing. Finally my wife got up and asked if someone could wait on us. So someone did. But as we sat there, we realized that the noise levels coming from the music were simply unbearable. Got an app for the Iphone and dB levels were in the 85-90 range. This is simply too high to have a conversation among normal people without yelling. And as a matter of fact, the manager who came over when we complained had to ask us several times what we said because she could not hear us over the noise. Noise levels in that range will hurt the workers ears, studies have shown when prolonged exposure is present.   Anyway, we asked to take our food home which we did, and enjoyed. Every time we have been, the food quality has been first rate. And while the prices are not low end, we do not mind paying for good food AND good atmosphere. Turn down the noise level by 10 decibels and we will back many times. Leave it where it is and we will not return....  and while you are at it, get a phone number. !!  who can imagine a restaurant, open for business, without a phone ?  I think they tried to rush the opening. If it was a test opening, then say that..invite feedback as you work into the real thing. Since there are 7-8 other locations, this should have been easy...."}
{"text":"Food was very good as was the service  Noise level too high for civil conversation  Wish they would serve meals and not just drinks & apps outside"}
{"text":"Had a tasty burger here the other day, had a toasted bun and was cooked to perfection.  The side of broccoli was decent but I'd probably take the fries next time.  Drinks are good, and the patio has a bada$$ fireplace.  Only downside is limited seating at the bar & slippery when wet glasses!"}
{"text":"This used to be our family go to dinner spot on Friday nights.  The service was friendly and the food was good.  They lost us as customers tonight. Our family of four walked in, with no one else waiting and were told we needed to sit on the patio or wait 15 minutes for a table.  Looking around there was a booth and at least one 6 top table open in the restaurant.  When we asked about the booth we were told it was for a reservation arriving in 15 minutes. When we asked about the 6 top we were told that the dinner rush was about to start and they couldn't sit us there.  At that point we walked out and went to Queen City Q.  The hostess was apparently a high school girl with too much authority and not enough training on customer service."}
{"text":"Enter here yesterday for lunch, service was ok. Was a little slow for there to be so little people. The name and advertisements are misleading. Burger King has better char grilled burgers than this place. Food is average, completely lacks flavor. Perhaps people like this place due to the location, tvs, and beer. That would be it. Save yourself time and money and go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Reasonable service and menu ... though we've had their burgers a few times now and while not bad, they aren't all that great either ... especially for a place that touts its burgers.  It is literally the flavor of the meat ... just seems a bit off.  Perhaps it is just our preference, but have had that same point of view from several family members.  Good options for those who want a dinner salad.  Good kids menu.  Nice atmosphere (though they do get busy from time to time, and it isn't a place where I would find a wait to be worth my time).  Damning with faint praise?  Maybe I'm being too harsh.  It is a pretty good spot, hence the three stars.  The restaurant itself is visually appealing -- they did a nice job opening this relatively new location."}
{"text":"I realize this restaurant has been open for approximately four weeks, but we have tried this location three times now to disappointment with each visit. The absolute best advice I have is for the staff to search for new jobs quickly as this location will not make it at the current performance.  The one good, redeeming thing about Char Bar in Mint Hill is the beer list, and considering there are other great spots for beer and wine enthusiasts within walking distance (notably, Vintner's Hill), this is not enough to warrant a visit to this location.  Their best food is on par with what a single guy-cooking novice may slap together on a weeknight. The chicken nachos are horribly arranged, stale, and include approximately a tablespoon of actual chicken scattered on top of the nachos. The chips and guacamole includes the runniest, least flavorful guacamole to ever be served and yet again, about a dozen stale tortilla chips with no offer to refill the chips. I'm not sure how they have had stale chips with every visit when chips stay fresher in my own home longer than this location has been open.  On our final visit, we placed an order for wings, which, to our dismay was futile since the kitchen  was out of wings but failed to notify our waitress until time to serve our food. No worries, we ordered a burger instead, as it is understandable that a restaurant could be out of wings. Unfortunately, they were out of ground beef too and were unable to accomodate burger orders. At this point, it was clear that the restaurant was out of over half of the menu options at a reasonable dinner hour on a Sunday evening.   If this were a one-off restaurant owned by a family or small group of investors entering the restaurateur business for the first time, I would be disappointed, but more understanding. However, this is a fairly successful local chain of restaurants that has completely failed to open an even moderately-managed restaurant. I would keep the hostesses, and quickly replace all of the kitchen staff and management before this place loses an absolute fortune. They have had their opportunity at this location, and it has gotten worse since first opening."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent management. Kimberly and her staff know how to take care of their guests."}
{"text":"Finally stopped in since we've seen it so busy over the past few weeks. Figured we would give it a try. The service was good, waiter was very attentive. The food on the other hand was honestly mediocre. We ordered the chicken nachos and I kid you not, they only put a few small pieces of chicken on them. Loaded the cheese though. Why call them chicken nachos if you're going to put virtually no chicken? Totally put us off. Fries are decent (they remind me of the fries Dunwellz serves down the road) and the burgers are decent as well. Not sure if I'll be back though."}
{"text":"The bf and I live by Char Bar and visit here often (a few times a months) and not just because of proximity but because we absolutely love it. From the food to the service it's become our favorite place in the area.  Food- We've tried a variety of things off the menu and have been beyond satisfied and pleased with it all. The only thing that didn't wow my mouth was the turkey burger, it wasn't bad per say but if you're going to get a burger get the real meat deal!! The CB7, Charleston, Southwestern, Leap Year and Cali burger are all fantastic. The pretzel appetizer is the best pretzel app around. All of their sides are phenomenal too.  Drink-They have good daily drink (and food) specials and a decent selection of craft beers. Their signature cocktails are hands down some of the tastiest I've had. I usually get the John Daily (sweet tea vodka and lemonade) or the cucumber mint cocktail made with vodka and gin!   Ambiance- I love, love, LOVE the outdoor patio (covered and heated in the winter). It is like being an a gigantic outdoor living room. The fact that they have multiple games showing on the many tv's is awesome, it is our go to place for Sunday football. The bathrooms are always clean and it's a good home away from home when a cocktail is needed or i want a burger.  Service- Hands down a huge reason we keep coming back. Everyone is so friendly and helpful and even if there is a mess up (which doesn't happen often) you won't even care cause they take such good care of you here. Derek is our favorite, he is just the biggest sweetheart like even if he isn't our server, you can't not be in a good mood when he is around cause he just is so positive and upbeat. Brianna is another favorite!"}
{"text":"This place used to be our favorite place to go. But for months the service/food has gotten progressively worse. Not to mention the music they play on the weekends makes you want to run out the door. Sad to see a place with great food (when it opened) and a great location go down hill so fast."}
{"text":"My new watering hole! Decent beer selection. Good food. Cozy environment.  Those two bearded bartenders make you feel at home.  I recommend the turkey sandwich, it comes on a pretzel roll and u get tater tots!"}
{"text":"Good food but poor service. Why would your drinks come out after your app. Why would you not check back before meal delivered or after to see if you need anything? Very slow and not busy, but again, the food was good."}
{"text":"Great burgers, tots, ribs Good selection of local beers Kid firendly"}
{"text":"Everything was great except the NY Strip. Overlooked for one.. But bland, unmarked, nothing special... No manager visit after server said she would notify one. Solid concept and execution. Grill thermometers and attentive management recommended."}
{"text":"We dropped in last weekend for the first time. Sat at the bar and got a couple appetizers. Service was friendly and prompt and food was great. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Wanted to give points to CB7 for consistency.  This continues to be one of our family's go to spots and the food, which has always been good, has ramped up a little bit over the past year.  The service has stayed very good and the experience remains high quality.  Lots  o be said for a good, reliable, reasonably priced spot.  Love the wings, burgers are great, and salads, which I have been doing more lately, are really good and fresh.  Yay Char Bar."}
{"text":"We went on a Monday evening, just 2 of us.  The restaurant was 3/4 empty, more wait staff than customers.  It took over 45 minutes to get 2 hamburgers, which were not that good.  One was made with the wrong toppings and had to be re-fired.  Both burgers were overdone.  Server was excellent, she kept coming by to apologize for the kitchen.  She gave us a free appetizer.  There are much better places around, we will not go back to this one."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. And I was extremely pleased. We started with the buffalo dip app which was good. I ordered the brisket burger medium and it has to be one of the best burgers I have ever had. My wife ordered a salad and she said she loved it. Our server was amazing. She was very friendly and helpful when ordering. She was fairly new to the restaurant but was knowledgeable. We can't wait to go back and eat dinner here again. I can't recommend this place enough. It will be our new go to spot in Matthews."}
{"text":"No Thx, went on a Sunday early lunch.  Slow service while not crowded Messed my order burger was too pink. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Best burger in town!  Great bar to watch games.  If I had any suggestions it might be to improve the presentation of the food to more match the price.  The quality is worth the price but the presentation is similar to a TGI Friday or something.  Just a thought!  Keep up the great work. Food is excellent!"}
{"text":"This place would be much better with larger portions and better drink specials. I don't consider $3.50 a 'special' on a domestic beer.  The wings are pretty good. I think wings are .60 cents on Wednesday night - that would be more reasonable than their regular price. Char 7 burger was pretty good but at $10 it is also pretty pricey for what you get.   I will probably go back here because it is convenient for me but I won't recommend it as it just isn't that special and prices are higher than most similar places."}
{"text":"Char Bar is everything a neighborhood hangout ought to be. It's handy, beside the post office on Carmel just north of 51.   You feel welcomed -- we were immediately greeted and seated by the guys who picked up my wife (chair and all) and scooted her closer to the table and then brought over another chair so she could prop up her bum leg.  You eat well -- our food was hot, prompt and plentiful. Rita's Quesadillas were prepared just the way she specified . . . and enough to take home for another meal. My hamburger was de - lishus! and I actually finished off the whole thing. I can put this place in the running for the best burger in Charlotte.  The after work crowd had not yet arrived, so there was plenty of room on the patio so we could enjoy a beautiful summer day in the high 70s.  But there's got to be a thorn among the roses -- right? It's the chairs. Char Bar needs to put steel sliders on the feet of the wrought iron chairs. They scrape screeching painfully every time someone gets up or down. Other than that one fault, they were very comfortable. with big, thick seat cushions.  I'll give this one four stars and come back often."}
{"text":"How is this place even serving food? I have tried it 4 different times, hoping I can hang out and wait for my daughter to finish dance class. The salad is old and disgusting, they deep fry their black bean burgers, and the drinks leave something to be desired, as in half poured martinis. Not to mention the attitude that Alan feels is appropriate. Come on dude, ur a bartender in BFE. You could and should do soooo much better. Char Bar - if ur gonna suck this bad, at least get some personable people on the evening shift to peddle ur shit. Richard, the daytime tender, is way more appropriate and competent and is the reason we've given you multiple chances. Unfortunately, you're the only one in this 2 mile vicinity. Very disappointing. Never again. And btw, get rid of Alan. Cancer in ur company."}
{"text":"Love this place! Service is better than expected with only few days open. Great beer selection. Had the ahí tuna and it was great. Plenty of seating options. Can't wait to sit outdoors next to the fire pit this Fall.!"}
{"text":"Had a really great dinner last night at CB7! I would give 5 stars for the food, 5 stars on service, but 3 for atmosphere. I got the leap year burger with sweet tots, and would totally get it again. The buffalo chicken dip app. was great too. I just found it a bit loud and crowded, the tables maybe just a little two close together. Definitely not a romantic dinner kinda of place."}
{"text":"Nice meal. Everything was delivered to our table in a timely manner and our meals were hot.   The best part of our experience was our server, Tysha,  who was a sweetheart."}
{"text":"First time eating here. I had the tilapia florentine. Omg was it good. It was on top of rice with a Parmesan spinach cream sauce, side order of delicious broccoli. Husband had the ribeye, it was good and cooked as he asked. We sat on the patio, very nice atmosphere. Service was prompt & friendly. We will be back."}
{"text":"First place we think of for good burgers in our area. Decent tap beer selection as well. They have good wings and sandwiches as well. Kids enjoy it as well which is always a plus. Yeah, sometimes the service is slow but I think it's a matter of it being too busy. It's much better than hickory tavern, which is really just average."}
{"text":"not many places get well-done as right as this place ... our burgers, both ordered well, were EXACTLY timed right, just out of pink.  Fries were OK, nothing special, but not greasy.  Fried pickles were spicier than most places ... were wedge cut Claussens I believe. Enjoyed them.  Lots of TV's but the noise level was quite low actually ...we were there around 5 on a Friday.  Seemed pricey at first, but when you factored in that the burger price included the fries, it works out about the same as ordering those separately at places like 5 guys."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to eat!  The food is always on point as is the service. Regardless of whether I'm sitting down to eat or taking it to go, the service is always quick and friendly and the food is delicious!  I hate seeing people have had bad experiences here, it's one of the few places in Charlotte where every experience has been excellent."}
{"text":"First visit was Saturday night as my co-worker has given the  Matthews such great reviews for their burgers/salads.  Nice bar/grill environment, fast and friendly staff, location to my house perfect.  I was NOT IMPRESSED with the \"chicken sandwich\" not only was it too much bread for the slither of un-flavorful chicken it was dry as saw dust, it was ONLY chicken, 3 sweet pickles and thick bread (no lettuce/tomato/sauce .  Course reading is fundamental which should have been a clue as it clearly said chicken sandwich no more or less.  My husband had the fish and chips which he enjoyed both fish and chip, not a fan of the kale slaw thou.  After reading the reviews and confirming with my coworker I will give it another try."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be great. But lately it has declined in both service and food quality. Many times we've ordered items on the menu to be told \"we're out of that\". Three times in five visits the restaurant has been out of baked potatoes! When I order a steak, I want a baked potato. Not broccoli or fruit or spinach! The weird thing is every time this happens, I have to ask the server...was this not noted a few hours ago? As in, hey we're down to 3 potatoes and it's only 6pm..perhaps we need more? Because a Publix grocery store sits less than 25 yards away from the restaurant! Twice our steaks were prepared incorrectly (one steak was completely charred black) and while the manager did bring out the redo steaks, he didn't seem very concerned or friendly. In the past, the same manager would come around to every table to inquire how was the meal/did we need anything, etc. Also I've been dismayed to discover their Tuesday night steak deal is now gone and has been replaced with Trivia Night. It would be fine if this was a bar/pub. However I was under the impression this was regarded as a nice sit down restaurant for families, couples, groups, etc. and the extremely loud atmosphere with a blaring announcer and cheesy music is one I'm sure I'll avoid in the future as well as many others who have remarked on the unpleasant environment on Tuesday nights. Also the whole trivia setup is a joke as we noted the one unfortunate time we came in on a Tuesday night that practically everyone who cannot be seen by the trivia announcer (which are many) was Googling every single question on their phones! That really isn't a fair process but since we weren't playing and ate quickly to get out of horrific noise of the once pleasant restaurant it didn't matter to us. Not sure if trivia night will continue but I know several of us who will avoid that now and although it's a lot further away, we will probably be heading to the other location on Carmel to see if their setup and availability of food items is comparable to how this location used to be."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for a local pub. Lots of TV's so you won't miss watching your favorite sporting event. The bar service is awful. Not sure what the bartenders are doing most of the time, they don't really seem that busy. The service at the tables is better but can be spotty depending on the server. The food is decent. Better than the average bar food. The burgers have generally been very good. The Fish & Chips is really bad. Small pieces of fish that are either overcooked or greasy. The chips are not traditional english fries but rather fried potato chip things. Not very good either. I really like their Chicago Dog. Very tasty, but the bun is generally over toasted so it falls apart as you try and eat it. Pretty good selection of beers on tap, bottles and cans. The patio outside is a great spot to hang when the weather is nice. Overall, it's a nice place that needs a little more focus on service."}
{"text":"I was excited for a new place in Mint Hill but unfortunately never got to try them out and will likely not come back until they get a new manager and better staff.   Manager was very rude to husband so we had to leave and he refuses to go back. On different occasion was extremely rude to friends of ours and they will not go back. Same thing with another set of friends. Who hired this man? He has unfortunately pissed off a group of people that know a lot of people and spend a lot of money going out. This could have been one of those places but we will not support a business that does not respect our presence and money.   So we will continue to support out favorites this way, Hawthorne's, The Hill, Vintners, Dunwellz.   Oh and another bar only open until 11pm? NEXT"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at my Char Bar No 7 experience. I'm not a huge fan of the food at  the Hickory Tavern so wasn't too excited to try this reinvented venue previously a Hickory Tavern. Walking up to the entrance I noticed a substantial outside seating area with a great relaxed feel. I could definitely see hanging out with a group of people when the weather gets a bit cooler. The interior has a warm lake house feel with lots of tv visibility. My buddy and I were there for a late lunch so the restaurant was almost empty. I was most impressed with the service. Our server was fantastic. He really knew the menu well and recommend the Southwestern Burger. It was spicy and cooked to perfection. I don't eat beef often so this was a welcome treat and I'm glad that it actually met up to how the waiter had talked the burger up. He recommend getting the onion rings & that was on target as well. Fresh, made from scratch in the restaurant and they sure tasted that way. Great food, great service and a comfortable atmosphere. Looking forward to trying out the new location closer to home off of Weddington & McKee Rd!"}
{"text":"Probably the best steak I've ever had! Longhorns, Ruth Chris going all the way back to Steak and Ale, tonight's ribeye was tender, juicy and grilled rare to perfection. The accompanying baked potato was also top notch and loaded. The slab of black and white cake was to die for and the Copper Ale on draft all for under 40 bucks. Save yourself the cost of a grill."}
{"text":"Really???  Husband picked up a to-go order of Chicken wings: 6 Buffalo, 6 Garlic Parmesan. Please tell me what azz In the kitchen though that this was ok to do. Had we been dining in and ordered the same, I'm quite sure this would have never been sent to the table since it would have been questioned right away!! Lesson learned - and never again; Kristopher's and Mac's Speed Shop are just down the road."}
{"text":"A little noisy if you sit inside but we have enjoyed every meal we have had here! Great to have a local go-to place."}
{"text":"Had some issues when they first opened. New manager, Roy and the staff have gotten it together. Local best kept secret. Locals should give it another chance as I did!"}
{"text":"Insanely slow service for a burger? Don't see a point in this place. I might wait for a special culinary feast this sure wasn't it. The ambience is pleasant the burgers are burgers and the service crawls we won't bother coming back."}
{"text":"Good find..bottled beer only but good menu.  Had a burger and the salmon both were very good.  Nice big screen TV and a nice covered outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"Great cocktails. I agree with others...really LOUD chairs when moved around on the outside patio!!"}
{"text":"We've been to Char Bar a few times and have always had an exceptional experience.  We combine it with weekly grocery shopping at Publix next door.  They have excellent drink specials every day and the menu offers some jazzed-up traditional pub items at reasonable prices.  For instance, there are about 10 different salads you can choose from, and if none of those work for you, you can build your own.  There are even more burger options.    We usually order a sandwich/burger.  They offer MUCH more than just your typical burger with cheese, lettuce, and tomato.  Last night, I ordered the CB7 Burger, which was blue cheese cole slaw, apple wood smoked bacon, swiss cheese, and their CB7 sauce on a pretzel roll.  YUM!  You also get a few different options as a side (tater tots, please!).  All for about $10.  The burgers are always so big and flavorful, too.    We usually sit indoors at a high-top near the bar, but we have ventured outdoors once.  They have a nice, good-sized outdoor patio on the side of the restaurant that offers a great atmosphere and plenty of fresh air."}
{"text":"Good burgers and not cooked how you want but still taste good and good drinks at a decent price. Beware it's not a place meant for young people"}
{"text":"Service needs major improvement but the food is decent to say the least. We decided to grab lunch after working out at the YMCA. I stepped into this place first holding my infant son and my teenage daughter was not to far behind as well as my girlfriend. This was my second visit and I normally give places multiple chances before writing review and this place was no different. This second visit was the same if not worst than the first visit. The service was terrible from the hostess to the waitress. The hostess was so uninterested in welcoming us and God forbid seating us with enthusiasm.  The 3 stars is from my first visit food mixed with the food we had at the second visit. Our first visit we had multiple appetizers in which we shared. They included a budget with a egg on it and fries and some chicken quesadillas. The second time I had salad, both times I had my baby with me and the hostess was pretty blow off-ish with me. There where plenty of tables available and when we entered the hostess provided blank stares both times and THE ONLY reason I went back the second time is because my friend wanted to go see her friend from college who was the executive chef at the time only to find out that he was no longer there (waste of a 2nd visit to this location).  Overall, if I were to try this place again it would be the other location in hopes that the host or hostess is not rude and unwelcoming."}
{"text":"Glad to have them in Mint Hill! Great food and the covered patio offers some great ambiance to the dining experience. My little family loves going here."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, i decided on the prime rib french dip which was awesome. I got a side of baked potato, which was huge. My wife got the smokehouse burger which was good along with tater tots.   I gave them 4 because the food was great. However, make sure you have time to wait because the staff works on the slow side.   All in all, the place is awesome and clean. Great place to watch the game, get a brew amd relax. Next time, I wanna try the outdoor patio with fireplace."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Char Bar regularly for lunch for a few months now. Same ownership group as Hickory Tavern. Extensive menu with many great options from salads to burgers to favorites like french dip and fish sandwiches. My favorites are the side though...mushroom risotto and sweet potato tots always do the trick depending on the entree selection. Service is great, and if it's a nice day outside, be sure to check out the patio area."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was underwhelming. We ordered burgers (9 to 11 bucks), and both my husband and I independently noticed that they tasted strangely salty. The fries were even saltier. Besides that there's nothing much to criticize about this place, but at the same time there was nothing that would make me want to come back."}
{"text":"Love this place for lunch and a good IPA beer, where they know about beer.  Salmon salad was great  - \"build your own salad\" with whatever u like - friendly and helpful Service."}
{"text":"Nice, new restaurant in Mint Hill.  Location and parking are good, friendly staff and pretty good menu.  Large draft selection with plenty of local choices.  Food is pretty good, but a little pricey compared to nearby competition (items about $2-3 higher than expectations).  Atmosphere mixed.  Nicer upscale/casual decor, but too many TVs cheapens the look.  Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Best steaks and bloody Mary's around we go every week and we love it. The staff there is extremely nice. Ask for Donnie he is awesome. Alan the bartender makes a killer Bloody Mary.   Thank guys for all the good times."}
{"text":"So I have waited tables for quite some time and like I said in my note that I left for the waitress, this has to be one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. A server came to greet us, got us drinks and got our appetizer in. Things were fine up to that point. Someone else brought our appetizer out, it was delicious. Then it took forever for us to get drink refills, I had to ask the hostess. We still had to wait for drink refills after this, but ok. Then, after a very long time our food finally came out. It was cold. The server/bartender never came to ask us how things were, and pretty much tossed the box on the table that I asked for. The tip I gave was generous considering how awful the experience was. I was advised not to go there, I should have listened. Won't ever go back."}
{"text":"Yum. I went for the first time today during lunch and I have nothing bad to say about it. The service was amazing, the food was amazing, the ambiance was chill.   Between my boyfriend and I, we got the buffalo chicken dip, southwestern salad and southwestern burger....southwestern happened to be our theme. And it was very tasty. And the portions were huge. We had so many leftovers.  I would definately come back and watch a game here. Very cool place."}
{"text":"Ordered a vodka tonic with my $16.40 salad and it  came to the table flat with no carbonation.  I asked my waitress Taya if she could have another one made with just plain carbonated water instead of bottled tonic water.  She came back with a glass of sour flat water with no alcohol in claiming it was straight carbonated water out of the tap.  It was obviously bottled sour tonic water.   Plain carbonated water does not come out of the tap tasting flat and sour.  She persisted it was and did nothing to correct it.  I don't know if it was the terrible night bar tender or ignorant waitress to blame.  Either way I just drank a beer I didn't want and paid over $80 for 3 drinks and 3 salads for a party of 3.  If you want overpriced food and crappy mixed drinks...this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I can't figure out why there are negative reviews on this place??  I have been here 4 times in the last 3 weeks with as many as 9 people and everyone has raved about their meals.  The service is outstanding and they have a great kids menu.  This is our new favorite place.  Great burgers!"}
{"text":"Wound up here because DunWellz had a wait. There's a reason this place did not. Our waitress, Haley, was great. Our food was not. Hubby's medium burger was very pink inside. Fries cold. Bleh. My gluten free bun was wet from the red meat juices and fell completely apart. Bleh. My side of broccoli was cold. Bleh. It was so loud, we had to shout to hear one another. Not relaxing at all. Both of us felt heavy and bloated after eating here.  Next time we will fire up the grill ourselves."}
{"text":"Very good place to take the family, kid-friendly.  I've been very pleased with the food and the beer selection.  Can get pretty busy on weekends with resultant slower service, but staff very friendly."}
{"text":"I love the bartender on Tuesday's and the girls on Friday nights! It's very nice. Great beer selection with lots of local craft beer on draft. Beautiful ambiance with great service it doesn't get any better then that!"}
{"text":"I have been twice. Both times the service was very good and the food was good too. My first visit I had the Leap Year Burger which suggests you should only have it once every 4 years because of how decadent it is. For health reasons, I would agree but for the love of God how can I have this burger only once every four years? It was DELISH and soooo bad for you, which made me like it even more. I have come to the realization that I swoon over anything that is topped with a fried egg which the Leap Year Burger has. YUMMO!!!!  Last night I had the Salmon Salad and although I appreciated the fact that they cooked my salmon as requested, Medium Rare, the salad itself was uneventful. Mixed greens with goat cheese and large rings of onion did not rock my world and the dressing that came with it, citrus vinaigrette, tasted artificial. I will most likely be sticking with their burgers.  Last night they were offering 1/2 price apps if you Liked them on Facebook. Not sure how long that special will last but it was a great way to get us to order one of their apps.. We had the Nachos and they were OK."}
{"text":"We made it for the first public dinner tonight. We went early and was greated very warmly and shown to a table right away. The table was near the front door and stayed busy with foot traffic during the entire meal. The waitstaff seemed overwelmed. We had long waits for drinks, food, dessert, the check and cashng out. Did not expect the Cigar City Florida Cracker beer to be a draft and it tasted a lot like  Blue Moon and since when is  Moscow Mule a \" charbar7 signature drink\" ? The appetizer was served barely above room temperature. The ribeye was nothing special, cooked as ordered, but I've  had better quality steaks at a lesser price. The smother me naked burger was not as advertised. There was no sizzling skillet and the field greens salad never arrived. Overall a big letdown from the newest place in Mint Hill."}
{"text":"My first visit tonight will be my last. Took over an hour to get a table that had been promised to be ready at 8 PM when we called to confirm at 7:30 PM for a party of 12. We didn't get seated until more than an hour passed and when seated no one came over to take drink orders. I had to go find someone for a waitress. The food took more than 30 minutes to arrive and by now it's past 9:30 PM and half the restaurant is empty. The manager came to table to apologize for the amateur service and she said she'd comp some meals or at least parts of the meals. NO SUCH COMPS WERE GIVEN and an 18% gratuity was added to all checks. I've visited many restaurants in Charlotte in 24 years of living here but this is among the top 10 worst experiences I've ever had. My impression is that no one on the staff really cared what happened to us and the manager's attitude pretty much cemented that view."}
{"text":"It's ,,  ok . .  I came for lunch during a slow time so the noise that that other reviewers talked about wasn't really an issue. The service was also good the waitress was good about keeping me in diet coke. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't really good either. For a place that only does beef they're not really good at beef. My medium rare burger was a solid medium and a little on the dry side and really kind of lacked flavor. The interior was nice lots of TVs around to watch and stuff but the food was really just average."}
{"text":"Friday night at 630. My wife and I went in to use a gift card. Seated right away, I could see the kitchen door from my seat.  Server came right over. Brought us our water to drink. Gave us a couple of minutes to look at menu. As we waited I could see wait staff and manager in kitchen eating from their hands every time kitchen doors opened. Placed our food order, drank my first glass of water. Empty glass. Salads came, very good. Water glassed filled from totally empty. Finished salads, maybe twenty employees walked by including manager and all ignored our empty salad plates. Water arrived with dinner. We had to do the plate exchange so he could sit down our dinners..dinner was very good..Hot, fresh and tasty. Good value to $$. No one checked on us while we ate. Water glass empty again. We paid and left. Yes I will return. BUT service should be improved. They were busy but no one waited for tables and there seemed to be plenty of staff. ONLY gave it three Starr's because food was good. But really how about service?"}
{"text":"I had a classic burger with mushroom risotto for a side - all good. Service was friendly and attentive. This place has neighborhood feel & atmosphere that is an unusual mix of bar and family restaurant. We went on recommendation of a friend and were not disappointed. Had the vanilla ice cream for dessert which was very bland and boring."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on Valentine's Day the ambience is beautiful, very clean. Servers are friendly and nice. I ordered the Mahi Mahi tacos they are fantastic with mushroom risotto it is out of this world delicious. I would come back here and bring my hubby and recommend everyone to try this place!"}
{"text":"I've had multiple satisfying experiences at this location. My wife enjoys the CharBar salad and I haven't gotten past the patty melt and onion rings to order anything else on the menu. I'd eat this any day of the week!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for a 1st time on a Friday night around 5:00 pm. Great atmosphere. We were in fireplace area.  We loved it. The waitress was superb and very attentive. We ordered Fried Pickles, the Bomber sandwich, Tilapia salad, and Smother Me Naked Chicken Breast. OMG! Everything was delicious and cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"I've been passing by this place for a long time and have always noticed it out of the corner of my eye whilst on my way to Southpark. It's an interesting little location that kind of juts out of the strip of businesses. True to the bar n' grill scene, Char Bar 7 is a good location in a pinch.   Ample bar seating in this place. There is a larger dining room, but we decided to have dinner in the lounge. The service was friendly. Nothing above and beyond. Most of the younger servers seemed a little inconvenienced to be there, but hey, it was a Saturday night. Started with the pretzels and they were just right. I like the addition of parmesan to the top and not just razor-sharp salt crystals. The cheese dip was nice and stood out from many others I've had as of late. Not the standard American cheese or beer cheese. This was made from, what tasted like, white cheddar or white American with nice pimiento and pepper chunks. Really dig the flavor these had. I'd order these again.   I ordered the Leap Year. Burger, bacon, cheese, and a fried egg. Got the bleu cheese slaw on the side. Neither were amazing by any stretch but had a nice touch. If you order a burger without a bun, it is served on a piping hot castiron skillet. Seriously...watch out for that stuff. It was hotter than Hades. I almost scorched my mouth with the first bite. The burger tasted just fine and I ate about half of the slaw. My wife ordered the mushroom risotto on the side of her veg burger. It was nice, but just like other risottos. Creamy, heavy, and a nice filler.   Major downside is the lacking draught beer. This place would be a 4 in my book if they had some locals on draught being switched out on the regular. I ordered the John Daly cocktail and it was great. Sweet tea vodka, lemonade, and a few other mixers. Nice, but too fruity and a longshot from a beer to work with my burger.   I will say that the patio is amazing. SO nice for the winter time. They have a cozy lounge with a fireplace and couches, completely enclosed and heated. Take that, cold air! I'd love to come back and just chill on the patio with some pretzels and another John Daly!  3.5 for sure. Cheers!"}
{"text":"The highlight of this place is the outdoor patio and even that is overcrowded. I did like the fireplace but it was overshadowed by the TVs in every corner. The food was okay-typical bar food, nothing special, and seemingly mediocre quality at best.  The service was okay-they forgot to enter my two year old nephew's kids meal and so that made our dinner a bit stressful waiting on his food when we all had ours. I asked for a special request to have no butter or oil used in the preparation of my veggie side dish and when it came out it was clearly covered in oil. My husband's setback was well done not medium like he ordered. I also felt that service was rushed-we weren't even close to being finished and the waitress was already bringing the dessert options by. The biggest issue I had was how they had people packed in like sardines-it felt like we were practically having dinner with the other two tables closest to us and wait staff kept having to squeeze behind our chairs and bump into our table when trying to get to other patrons. I won't be heading back any time soon. I can see how my husband might want to spend a Sunday afternoon watching spots here but that's about it. I will say the woman who greeted us at the door was welcoming and friendly."}
{"text":"The food was delicious the service was excellent. The outdoor seating area is beautiful with the fireplace. Great addition to the Mint Hill area."}
{"text":"The food is good if you like greasy! The burgers and fries are good and the service CAN be good. The patio is comfortable and when the weather is right, it's great!"}
{"text":"Went first time . Had to wait 30 minutes and they set us on deck which is nice but only can get appetizers and drinks outside. Would have been nice to be able to eat out there. But issue is they text you. They bring drinks and then we get texted which unfortunately did not see immediately. So asked waitress how I pay for drinks and she said have to wait. So did and then went up to get table and they said too long over 10 minutes. Need a better process this is terrible. Daughter went Day before and food was ok steak ask for rare and came well done. It took so long to get they just ate it. Need to work out kinks quick."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new place to get a burger in Charlotte. We both got burgers and ordered them medium with tater tots. The burgers came out well-done. It didn't bother me much, I just noticed. I assumed with it's name, the burgers would be spot on. The tater tots were heavily salted and basically tasted like thick potato chips. My first thought was to give this 2 stars, but something did stand out. This might be a great place to come and watch the game. Plenty of TVs. A big open patio complete with couches. If you are looking for a place to get a beer and watch a game with a group while also getting decent food, this may be your place in South Charlotte. We may be back come football season."}
{"text":"Last night was my 5th visit the CharBar7, and up until then, I would have given this place 5 stars. Although our waitress was nice, everything else fell short compared to our other visits: -the usually soft pretzels were ROCK HARD, and beer cheese was stiff and solid -the burger was EXTRA salty.  -we were sitting on the screened in/heated patio, employees decided to socialize and smoke right outside the patio door, and prop it open with a chair, letting all of the cold air and smoke in. -kitchen staff was sitting in booths in the aprons talking on the phone and taking what looked like a break.  There was not a manager in sight. We left the restaurant to finish watching the football game somewhere else. We will give them another chance, but it looked like a free for all that evening."}
{"text":"Had a chemo treatment yesterday, so not in the best of moods.  Asked hostess for a seat away from noise - Done Waiter was there immediately to get drinks - Perfect  Ordered a burger, can you put the pickles and onion on the side - Done Changed my mind and asked for another cheese - Done Kinda drank my tea fast, immediate fill-up - Perfect Food arrived Hot and delicious, onion and pickles on the side -Perfect  Staff was excellent, food wonderful - Felt better when I left than when I came in, can not htank you enough."}
{"text":"Came one night for drinks... came back a Second night because we loved the outdoor patio and menu looked good! Food was great. We got a small order of Chicken Nachos, and French dip and Cali-Turkey for entrees. Sweet Potato tots are delicious"}
{"text":"I'm a regular, come about each week sometimes twice a week. The service is always great and they take their time to get to know you. The food is always awesome too, and I get something different each time because their menu is not stagnant."}
{"text":"We went to Char Bar 7 Mint Hill today for lunch, first let me say this is the first time I have had issues as I have been to location several times. We arrived around 1:45 pm there were very few tables of customers, however we stood at the front door and waited to be seated for 10 minutes. While we were standing there a lady I assume was the manager ran by us a few times and never said a word. We finally got seated and got our waitress and ordered, my niece got Seared Ahi Tuna and I got Smoked Turkey Sandwich with tater tots and a side of fettuccine Alfredo. We waited 30 minutes for our food to arrive our waitress apparently knew the people at the table beside us she stood there talking while we had empty glasses and no lunch. When the food finally came the sandwich was delicious the tater tots were nasty they were overcooked and cold and the fettuccine was flavorless it was like it was missing the cheese all butter. The waitress did bring me fries for the tater tots, but nothing else was addressed and even that seemed like a problem. I am very disappointed as the Char Bar is one of the nicest restaurants we have in Mint Hill it is also expensive, especially when the food isn't up to standard and the service is lacking."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, food was good still working out the kinks, stick to the tacos,  nachos and Asian salad. Beer selection is good."}
{"text":"On my second visit to Char, we are dropping 2 stars off.  From the reviews I see that them cooking the hell out of beef seems to be standard. For the second time my burger was overcooked - not slightly this time, but way overcooked.  If you are unable by law or unwilling to cook a burger to medium, just fess up and I'll order chicken.  My order of a brisket burger ($12), which I asked for medium, came out as well and dry.  Dry, tasteless.  The onions were undercooked.  The tater tots as a side were fine.   Service was again excellent and we sat out on the patio which had a nice breeze and made for easy conversation.  But the service and amenities don't make up for the apparent consistently overcooking of beef.  Pass."}
{"text":"I like their build your own salads. I think they have every ingredient you can think of. And you can add a protein. Their wings are good. I think it was the jerk seasoning I had. You have the option of getting them charred. The charred wings are very good. I also tried the bourbon glazed salmon which was delicious. The service is great and the atmosphere is very relaxed. There are tvs about so you can watch sports while eating."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.   Went for lunch; not very busy. We both ordered medium burgers.  They were well done and warm when received so it seems that they sat for a bit.   The burgerss were not very flavorful either.  Not what you would expect for $10-11 burgers.   Overpriced and under flavored.   I highly doubt that we will be back.  Too many better choices out there"}
{"text":"Will definitely be going back here!  Met a couple girlfriends for drinks/appetizers and it was wonderful.  It's new, so the inside is nice and clean and the atmosphere was great.  Service was fabulous and the food was good.  Sometimes these places are hit and miss with appetizers, but definitely no complaints!  One thing to look out for is the lack of parking, just FYI."}
{"text":"Wife and I found this to be just OK minus.  Nothing special.  More of a 2.5 star, but more 2 than three.  More of a drinking place than an eating place.  Very nice patio and very roomy inside.  Great for groups  We had ribeye steaks, which though cooked as we ordered could have come from your local chain supermarket.  And were they SALTY!  Must be the way they get flavor in their so-so meat.  Cassidy was our wait person and she was really good, friendly and helpful in how to order the sides we wanted to try and split so as to fit into the \"comes with\" price.    Baked potato was also SALTY as I ate the skin...big mistake and I really felt queezy with all the salt from the meat and the potato.  Asparagus was grilled, which was good, but a skimpy portion of those skinny things.  House salad was not so good because we ordered the balsamic vinaigrette dressing which was very heavy and powerful  They do not make their own dressings and it showed.  Beer was good.  Prices were far too high for the quality of what is served.  Not a place we will return to, even though it is very convenient to where we stay.  Too bad."}
{"text":"Great spot very close to home - I love the Elbows Out Burger with tater tots and my wife always gets the Ribeye sandwich. Nice beer selection with a full bar, I always go early to pick up my takeout just for that reason. Dining in has always been enjoyable as well."}
{"text":"We had the fried pickles as an appetizer, they are cut in spears and not round chips which was different. Breaking was crispy and good and so was the sauce. I had a wedge salad and at first I thought there was no dressing but most of it was underneath.  It was good! Husband got a burger and the fries were great. Very loud, went there for late lunch.  Huge place. Open patio.  A wonderful addition to mint hill!"}
{"text":"Love the casual atmosphere at Char Bar 7. The menu is diverse and the food is dependably tasty. It has a pub type feel and friendly staff. From the moment you are greeted at the door until you leave, the staff is very considerate of pleasing."}
{"text":"Very modern up town feel. It's very loud so not recommended if you're looking to have a conversation with those at your table. It looked like they had some type of outdoor covered seating but it's right on a busy street, even sitting toward the back of the restaurant we were drowned out by the sounds of traffic.  The menu was a ok albeit a little on the pricy side. General consensus was a one and done."}
{"text":"This place is okay. Really crowded and definitely overpriced. But, since there are not really any better food options in Mint Hill I think they are a good choice if you don't mind spending a little more than what you get is worth. I wouldn't recommend the steaks, though. Pricier item on the menu and not worth it. Stick to burgers and salads."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here and focused on the Smokehouse Burger and fries!  Burger was tasty, it had bacon and onion straws on it.   The fries had seasoning on them that I didn't care for.  Interior was nice and comfortable, and my server was nice too.  My bill for entree and iced tea was a little over $15 before tip, so I felt like that was a little high."}
{"text":"Service was decent and the ambiance was nice.  I was hoping the food would be a little better for the price.  Best description is this was an average experience.  Nothing bad, and nothing great."}
{"text":"Really good burgers, my son also really enjoyed his corn dog. My burger was large and perfectly done.  The French fries were good but a little heavy on the salt. Staff was friendly and very attentive.  My wife enjoyed the shrimp tacos, but felt the generous amount of sauce made them a bit \"messy\" but very tasty."}
{"text":"Brook our waitress was awesome. Food an atmosphere great.  FINALLY Mint Hill has a great restaurant.  The wings are awesome & the burgers an 3 dip chips. Quesa cheese dip, pica, Guacamole"}
{"text":"(5/26/13)  We keep passing this place but never tried it. Our server is Taylor.  The half order of nachos I ordered was nothing spectacular. It was good bar food but little else. I had read Ben's review while waiting for the appetizer to appear. I was hoping that there would be an improvement.  I ordered a bomber sandwich with onion rings for my meal. My wife ordered a dozen teriyaki wings. She was happy with her meal. I was actually surprised by mine. I wasn't expecting anything more than average, but the meal exceeded expectations.  The first thing I noticed about the bomber was that the bread seemed off in some way. I seemed as though it was falling apart & that the bottom of the sandwich was on top. I flipped the sandwich over & discovered that it was breaded with two giant pretzels! Very unique! The shaved ribeye was very good & though the sandwich was the messiest thing I'd ever eaten I thought it was very good.  The onion rings looked like they had a lot of breading but it was deceptive. When I took a bite out of one I discovered that the onion ring inside was doubled up. They were very tasty too. I finished the meal off with a slice of Creamsicle cheesecake. It was very good. The flavors were not overwhelming. We both had sweet tea & our server Taylor always made sure that we had plenty to drink. We will return."}
{"text":"We went for a Sunday night Karaoke...we loved it !!! Our Waitress Makenzie was amazing !! We WILL be back !!!!!!"}
{"text":"The 12 oz ribeye was cooked perfectly, the seasoning spot on. I had never had char7 steak sauce but ended up loving it. It's creamy and not like my favorite which is A1. Really enjoyed the brussel sprouts with the sauce! The quinoa salad was a light and smokey flavor. Very good. Service great. This was a first visit but I will be back. Price was high for a ribeye, carmelized onions and mushrooms were awesome.   Took home chicken tenders and the desserts are worth a look!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here for the first time. They are brand dandy new so any so called \"negative observations\" - are only because they are new....it should not be held against them in any way. Most places take a few months to find their rhythm if they are a chain. Which CharBar 7 is...  So....I gave them a five star for food delivery speed, quality of food prep/presentation and flavor as well as server personality and pleasantness.   I had the 12oz ribeye, side salad and sauteed spinach with a slice of garlic/Texas toast. Amazing!!! Cooked Medium and delivered as such. Wonderful seasoning.   Suggestions for the chef...serve a slice of fresh lemon to put over the spinach to give it a nice flavorful zing. It breaks up the spinachs ability to put a chalky feel on the back of your teeth. A bit oily/buttery so to a little lighter. Otherwise really good!!  Their house Merlot is very good, fruity and smooth. Desserts were great. Glad the menu wasn't huge, they definitely focused on the right mix.  I had to ask for extra napkins, I had to ask for A1, I counted apx 14 servers and bar staff and while seated quickly and with a smile, took almost ten minutes to get someone to take my order. For a drink but I was ready with my food too :D  Having said that...folks that's just normal growing pains and training which CharBar did in spades tonight! Great job, every waitress I saw had someone shadowing them. It was quiet when I got here before 5.  The staff were amazingly pleasant and attentive once served. Which is why I said the five star is for what counts.... everything was what I'd expect and want in a new place to eat out. You shouldn't and can't write a review bashing what amounts to training.   Time will tell, wait six months and write another review but from what I saw tonight? Great new place!! Can't wait to come back again. Just go during the week and before 530pm to avoid crowds.   Oh, they close for the afternoon so plan to arrive by 4pm on a week day to beat the crush."}
{"text":"Too bad this place is a let down ...food consistently comes out cold ...we've been now 3 times ..such a loss ...Idk if it's the kitchen or management ..two months later all new faces , same terrible food production and way less business than I would have expected for a much needed place in mint hill. Good luck guys , you need it ! Will not be fooled a 4th time."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite local neighborhood spots. They have an awesome patio (small, but very cozy with a fire place and great couch seating.  Lots of TVs inside, so great for watching games. The \"Twisted Cucumber\" drink with Skinny Girl Cucumber Vodka, gin, lime, mint = deliciousness!!!"}
{"text":"Not crazy about it at first  1st I tried to order wings to go over the phone and they don't do that ! Really . They want you  come in and sit and wait. Ridiculous. I got wings somewhere else .  Now we went in to eat  The floor is greasy or some Residue ... my chair slides  if I lean.  We waited an hour not too bad for Friday night we were warned .  The manager was dry and condescending.  The waitress took a while .. she then took a napkin off then table to write down our order. That was odd.  The garlic wings were really good . The beer selection is very good . Kids menu options also very good .. they have steak on it !  The atmosphere is good  They only opened 2 weeks i would Like to think it will get better .. I would go probably back ."}
{"text":"This was a nice place to eat! The burgers were good and not too expensive, but the fries were pretty bland. The restaurant gives you very large burgers that taste delicious! I would recommend the smokehouse burger with a side other than fries. The service was okay, and the waiters and waitresses were all fairly friendly. It's not perfect, but I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking to grab a bite with friends and family!"}
{"text":"All this talk of best burger in town had me salivating, I had to give that a try. Well it may be the best but not for someone who likes red meat: the barmaid said medium well or medium only.   Ok, so I ordered the rib-eye sandwich one more time. The meat was plentiful for a sandwich and very tender too. Being able to chose a pretty good mushroom risotto as the side was a bit of a treat so all's good ...   ...with the exception that after having spent 6 months in Charlotte $14 for a steak sandwich seems kind of expensive. Plus I didn't get to try their burger cooked how *I* like it. Almost forgot this : their \"first things first\" drink special doesn't for allow any substitutions . Could you please leave out the Koolaid ?.... \" No, that's the way they come\"   m'kay."}
{"text":"We had a great experience! We were worried for other bad reviews but we had a gift card, so we decided to try either way. Wait time was accurate (15 min on Sat night). Our service could have not being better (thanks Dakota) and the food was A+ (steak and tuna salad). We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Char Bar 7 at least 50 times. Staff is always impeccably nice and hard working. Reading some recent reviews left me puzzled. Especially the door issues. I can't imagine anyone not being able to figure out how to enter. I will continue to enjoy  this hidden gem. Love me some Char Bar!!"}
{"text":"My daughter brought home the worst wings I've ever eaten - courtesy of Char Bar 7. Now, I realize it was SuperBowl Sunday and lots of people were ordering wings - that doesn't mean you send out sub-par items. We ordered a lot - 3 different flavors, around $40-45 worth. None of the flavors had sauce, and I mean zip. They all tasted the same, and quite a few were on the fence between done and maybe.......? Didn't want to ruin our party by having them take the wings back, but will not be eating here again thanks to this experience."}
{"text":"Decent food, but nothing to write home about. Typical American fare for lunch - sandwiches, salads, etc."}
{"text":"This was our 3rd attempt for this place.  Its so convenient  and there aren't alot of choices in Mint Hill,   but again, we waited to sit, we waited longer for food, we even waited to pay.  Seems to be more of a management  issue.  Agree with the other reviewer,  staff are slow, but question if its kitchen staff or wait staff.   None-the-less if you don't have time to wait and wait and wait, might want to choose somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is my first visit here, and it was great! Service was good during lunch. It wasn't crowded at all. We had the pretzels, which were soft and coated with butter. The parmesan cheese jalapeno was on the processed side, but still ok. The burger was great. A bit more cooked than the Medium Rare that I wanted, but juicy, served with fried pickles and spiced fries. I don't think it was sloppy as others may have said, but I normally eat just the burger and not the bun."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for lunch while in the area doing some serious retail therapy.  I had done a quick Yelp search and Char Bar No 7 seemed like the perfect place for a decent, quick lunch.    The menu was pretty large, with burgers being the star and plenty of ways to customize their burgers.  I got the Classic burger but made it a turkey burger for only $1 more.  The options for sides were fries, tater tots, or onion rings.  Anyone who knows me knows I'm a sucker for a breaded and fried onion, so I went with the rings.  My sister got the sweet potato tater tots, and I kind of wish I had looked at the menu more to see they were an option.  The turkey burger itself was cooked perfectly and was plenty juicy and flavorful.  I asked the waitress if they were made in house.  She said they weren't but that they add an in-house seasoning blend to the outside of it before they cook it.  She also said that the turkey burger is what she gets for lunch every day and it was easy to see why.  The onion rings were a let down, though.  They were scrawny, thin onion slices with a breading that was a bit too peppery for my tastes.  I'm also super picky when it comes to onion rings, so maybe that's just my issue.   Even though we weren't there to watch any football games, it was nice how they had the helmets of the teams playing underneath the TV so you could easily see which games are on which screens.  The service was really quick and we were back on the road to shop some more in no time.  For what we were looking for, Char Bar definitely delivered."}
{"text":"\"Smither me naked\" chicken entree rocks!  Had it for the third time last night. Low carb - high protein go-to. Service also friendly and accessible"}
{"text":"Saturday 5pm. Place filled quickly around 5:30. Patio looked inviting, just a bit warm out for our taste. Maybe after the sun was down. No reservations for under 8ppl, call ahead seating 30min to get on the list.   Glad I went with a group! We tried (almost) EVERYTHING!Not really, the menu is HUGE! Fried pickles, das pretzels, nachos, onion rings, honey/hot buffalo wings to get started. Everything  fried was clean, lightly battered & crisp.  Pretzels- warm, salty & chewy awesomeness. Pickles- spears not chips. Not overly battered so you actually taste the cuc. Tart and crisp. Good but, not necessary, dipping sauce.  Nachos- not the dry on bottom type. These chips were well dressed and ready to party. Chicken, cheese, beans, peppers, tomatoes, in every bite. No digging around.  Wings-half buffalo hot and half honey hot (good, sticky & spicy)- dry seasoned, good heat and crisp. Did not miss that (oh so good) saucy mess.   Kids had hot dogs. All beef classic. Good selections for kids, with fruit options (!), not just hotdog and chicken fingers.  Two elbows off the table (and they were)- deffinatly take this for a spin. Triple meat (beef, salami and more awesome thin sliced beef), provolone, chipotle mayo, savory, sweet salty in one pretzel bun'd bite.   Texas Brisket- yes, each time, yes. Cooked to order, sweet tender meat, crisp onion rings, obligitory tomato and lettuce all held together with a steak knife on a dissapointing bun. All this awesomeness could not be contained by this brioche. Fell apart as it was not so daintily enj.. okay to be honest..destroyed. Dispite the bun.   CB7- Blue cheese slaw, bacony, swiss cheesy goodness with the not so secret CB7 sauce on a pretzel roll. Good starter burger.  Sirloin steak salad- basicly a classic wedge (chopped up) salad with sliced steak.   Packed up a bit to take home.  Dessert was not an option. Though we really wanted to.  Drink specials everyday.  Sat $3 Blue Moon / Sam Seasonal. Good cold draft.  Good wine selections.  If you get a few apps.. ask them to not fire the entrée for a bit. You'll want to enjoy the apps.  The entree on top of app. rush happened and the plate stacking began.  Fresh made tea.  Great experience, even better attentive staff."}
{"text":"Neighborhood joint with lots to offer.  This place has great salads and what look like good burgers, I personally have never tried one because they offer so many good salad options and tasty appetizers.  The apps are pretty standard from what I've seen at other places in Charlotte: wings,  fried pickles etc.  this was actually my first fried pickle experience and it was good. I don't really understand the whole fried pickle thing because pickles are so awesome on their own but what doesn't taste good fried?!  I love the seared tuna salad.  One of my favorites and my husband loves the French dipped sandwich.  This place is super kid friendly with a pretty decent sized kids menu that even has steak, which my 4 year old was thrilled about and they get cookies with their meal too.  Lots of cocktails offered with a full bar but I haven't been impressed by any of the cocktails yet.  I think most people come for the beer anyway which they also have lots of, both bottle and draft.  This is one of the few places in this part of town that is open pretty late and usually a go to spot after a fun dinner when we are not quite ready to end the night.  The outdoor patio is enclosed and makes for a fun summer night too!"}
{"text":"i enjoy Char Bar. It's an upscale burger/wing joint. Anyone who's been to Hickory Tavern will note the similarities since the same group owns both concepts.   The size and shape of the space creates a tight space and does create a noisy atmosphere. But, considering they have 2.3 TVs for every diner, you're not coming here for a romantic evening. We haven't seen the outdoor patio in use, but the space looks very inviting.  The service staff is well-trained and very friendly.   This is a nice fit for the area, but not a destination location."}
{"text":"I love the drink specials that change nightly. The Moscow mules are delicious. The steaks are cooked spot on, the salads are refreshing, and who doesn't love tater tots?! The mushroom risotto is my personal favorite side dish. You can get spare rib mushroom risotto as a meal and it's enough for two and so, so delicious. We went Saturday evening, and had great drinks, dinner, and we're able to watch the Kentucky Derby. This is nice enough for a date night but casual enough for a girls night out. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"A very good place for lunch. They have huge sandwiches. I had chicken and my friend had a steak sandwich. Both were very good. Nice atmosphere and a friendly staff."}
{"text":"Quality food. Convenient location close to my house. Great place to go with the family on a weekday."}
{"text":"One of our goto places with great burgers and amazing appetizers.  They also have very laid back live music on Friday nights. You can sit on the couch with a cold beverage and some apps. We have our favorite servers, Clint and Cam but 90% of them are great. It is always hopping after 6 so get there early or prepare for a little bit of a wait, especially on weekends."}
{"text":"Love the neighborhood grill. Great patio. Surprised to find the steaks are pretty good. Good cuts of meat. Black bean burger is great for a vegetarian option. Trio dips are good sharing app. Beer selection is not extensive but there are local choices."}
{"text":"I'm giving Char Bar No. 7 5 stars, because not only is it good eats, someone needs to offset J.H., who apparently believes that a suburban restaurant's lack of valet parking is some great crime.  Seriously? Just walk to the front door; it's like twenty feet.  Anyways, Char Bar is in the running for the best burger in Charlotte, in my opinion.  They have some creative combinations, the meat is cooked just right, and--hallelujah--the burgers don't fall apart when you pick them up.  I'm looking at you, Bad (Big) Daddy's.  There's also an amazing patio.  I can't wait until it's warmer so we can enjoy it.  I recommend the Carolina Blue burger to start. There's nothing like chili and slaw on a burger.  Also, get the sweet potato tots as your side.  They're dang tasty."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Horrible service. Horrible attitudes, awful food, especially the fries. They tasted like they were cooked a couple days ago."}
{"text":"We call this home base. Easy to feel right at home here! And the food is good too!  From the burgers to the wings to the salad or even the fish... all is solid and reliable."}
{"text":"The food was actually very good, but they lose a star for noise level (oppressively loud) and beer selection.  We had a steak (cooked perfectly) and a burger (very good).  I would also say that if you are going to build a bar, you need a footrail for the shorter patrons.  To avoid the noise, as for a booth in the north end of the restaurant."}
{"text":"We recently had a large get together for a friends birthday this past weekend here.  We took up most of the outside patio which was beautiful!  Stone fire place, comfortable couches and great atmosphere.  They turned the heaters on for us when it got too chilly and the service was all around awesome!!  Separated all bills for us wit no problem!  Will be back!!"}
{"text":"We have gone to the Matthews location as well as the one in Carmel Commons for years. Absolutely one of our favorites and we're ecstatic that it was coming to Mint Hill. The management has failed miserably as we have now tried it 3x in Mint Hill and will not go back. That's not true, we will still go to the other locations as it is an amazing restaurant, just not the Mint Hill location. My suggestion would be to have the leadership over for a few months from the other locations to build the consistency consumers I used to."}
{"text":"I love this place the patio is amazing and the food is pretty good. I only wish the it wasn't so over priced. The wait staff is friendly and the atmosphere is relaxing I just don't like spending an arm and a leg when I can get stronger drinks at half the price right down the street but over all a good bar."}
{"text":"Had a pleasant experience at Char Bar. Drinks and apps were great- there's knowledgeable staff who are very engaging.   Unfortunately the food is not quite up to par with the service. I ordered a salad with steak cooked med, and it came well done. And my dining partner ordered chicken with mac & cheese. Now I'm not an expert. But I'm pretty sure it was from the blue box of kraft that they were serving. I don't know if this is a one time occasion or if this is always the version of the dish served. Just because it was served in cast iron...  But (while the blue box was cooked exactly to package directions and tasted fine) there was a higher expectation from our table. We did have a good laugh, though."}
{"text":"We received a gift card for our anniversary. Since we live in Mint Hill, we were excited to try out this new restaurant. We  arrived around 8:00 pm and had to wait about 50 minutes. Once we were seated, we got our drinks pretty quickly. We had a hard time hearing each other, it was loud in there. We also ordered an appetizer......chips with guacamole and queso. The queso was cold, the consistency of glue and didn't have a lot of flavor. The guacamole was plain and mostly tasted like lime juice. Chipotle does a much better job with their quac. Our chips weren't that great either. I ordered the Southwestern burger and a small Caesar Salad. The salad was good and it tasted fresh. My burger came and the bun was dry....meaning no mayo or anything on it. Once I started eating it I realized it wasn't a Southwestern. The cheese on the burger appeared to be some type on spread. I believe they are using mostly pre-made food they heat up. It tastes like there is no love or real cooking behind it. The burger wasn't good. I'd like to think I know burgers. Bad Daddy's Burgers, amazing burgers! The CharBar.....completely unimpressed. I believe this is suppose to be their speciality. My husband ordered the black bean burger, it was kinda dry. Nothing really special. He also got the Fettuccine Alfredo as a side. It was plain and needed seasoning. Hopefully the Owners and Management check on these reviews...I think you guys need to make some changes."}
{"text":"I am SO excited we have a new restaurant in Mint Hill. I'm a fan of the CharBar in Matthews so I figured this would be just as good. The decor in here is amazing. They did an awesome job with the design and I love how the doors open onto the patio. It just gives it a cool feel.   I expected some issues since it was opening night, but everything went smooth. Our server was very friendly and fast. Our beers took a little long to come out, but I believe it was due to the fact there was a very needy table who wouldn't let our waitress go get the beers. Our food came out fast and fresh and at the correct temperature. I had the pretzels and my husband had a burger and tater tots.   We will definitely be regulars here!"}
{"text":"Although we always have great service here, what we ordered yesterday was mediocre at best; shrimp tacos & mahi tacos; sound great and simple enough but the shrimp was tough and the mahi had a very fishy taste. Send them back? No. Will we return? Probably and select something different."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good (had a very good steak), service was just average, but the noise level was far too loud. The music was at a level that encouraged strained conversation, which makes for a less than relaxing evening. I don't plan to return soon--too many better options for the money."}
{"text":"Very solid bar food, good beer selection, and friendly service."}
{"text":"The food is good but the atmosphere is terrible.  They were clearly understaffed on a Friday night. It was so dark we had to use a flashlight to read the menu.  The live music was so loud we could not have a conversation.  And when he did take a break the regular music was just as loud.  I would skip this place and go to Hawthorne's next time."}
{"text":"The pork belly tacos are fantastic, very spicy and hot. I come here at least once a month, the food is always good."}
{"text":"Was told 30 min wait after an hour we went to check and we're still #7 to be seated so dicided to sit outside and have a drink  and wait. after another hour waiting decided to go check again and our reservation was gone??? Never got text that we where next, nothing. Open tables sat for 10-15 min before being turned???? Losing money mint-hill... New store so hope they will get there act together... kinda disappointed Oh ya apparently you can bring your dogs, and not service dogs?????"}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio!  We love to relax on the cushy sofas and watch the roaring fire in the beautiful stone fireplace.  Generous pours!  Staff is always friendly and good service.  Favorite appetizer is the trio of dips.  Choose from several delicious dips with chips."}
{"text":"If at all possible I try to eat twice at a restaurant before I review their food... I've been able to eat at CharBar 7 twice in the last week and I am afraid my review isn't very positive.  On the plus side the service here is generally very good. The bartenders and hostesses are friendly and the waitstaff is attentive and their opinions on the beer selection are well considered and insightful.  My biggest issue is with the food... Earlier this week I tried a steak and it was fine but it was not a $21 dollar steak. It was a steak I could have done just as well at home for a quarter of the price. The cut lacked marbling and it was underseasoned. It was good to see brussel sprouts but they lacked a good charred or smoky flavor.  Later in the week I tried the fried chicken thighs on their tailgate menu and a Big Pit(?) burger, a burger with pulled pork, fried pickles and bbq sauce.   The three chicken thighs covered in white gravy were delicious, no question. Unfortunately they were all undercooked, each one bloody at the bone. Curiously onr thigh had the complete thigh joint as well as part of the leg bone... The gravy was great and if it were cooked correctly it would have been a winner.  The burger was ridiculously thick and overly salted. The fried pickles were gummy and the tomato was completely lost in the mishmash of flavors.   I also tried their homemade chips for the second time and again they were bland, limp and chewy. They need to be half as thick and cooked to order.   If the prices were more in line with a typical tavern I wouldn't be so critical but they are asking top dollar for food that is done better at half a dozen places in town for 25%-50% less."}
{"text":"Went yesterday with a group of ladies for an ornament exchange and the wait for everything is ridiculous. After getting our drinks, it was about a 20 minute wait to finally order off the menu because our waitress disappeared. After ordering, our waitress disappeared again for a while and everyone needed refills. Finally after about an hour of waiting on our food (which was a ridiculous amount of time considering it wasn't busy AT ALL), everyone received their food except for me. Which normally waiting about 5 minutes for your food to come out after everyone else has theirs is no big deal but I sat there for 20 MINUTES waiting on my food. Everyone was done eating by the time I finally got mine. Great atmosphere and good food but TERRIBLE SERVICE!"}
{"text":"Hot, well-cooked burgers.  Love them tater tots. Nice selection of beers."}
{"text":"They are just another burger joint honestly.   The staff is nice and friendly. Their burgers are nothing out of the ordinary. It was kind of weird honestly because I ordered a burger that had bacon on it but I was charged extra for bacon. Make sense? Ya didn't think so. What also sucked I like my burgers about a medium but it was well done and since we were on the patio we didn't see our server a whole lot but she was pretty nice so can't complain on her.   The upside the burgers are a good size so you get a good bit of food just wish they'd give more fries with it.   Also my wife wanted to sit on the patio and it is pretty nice out there. They have a fan up top running so it was a nice little spot to hang out at and have lunch."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Seriously. The service was amazing but if I wanted just service I would go and get a message. I can't believe that this \"Resturant\" sells itself as a beef/hamburger joint. Get anything but the chilli or hamburgers and you'll be fine; well you'll be but your wallet won't. Stupid overpriced. The best thing I can say is the draft beer is ice cold..."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and great atmosphere! We came here while on a trip and had an awesome experience with Lindsay as our server. Definitely check this place out if you have a chance!"}
{"text":"Went this weekend . Absolutely awful service. Waited over 30 minutes to get drinks. Manager very hateful. I sure hope they get it together. Not worth the wait or the money."}
{"text":"Char bar 7 is a lovely place to dine with a party. Having a nice heated/cooled patio is wonderful when you just want to be outside. The lunch menu isn't extensive but it does have something for everyone. Although the food was good, my favorite part of our meal was the appetizer. The buffalo chicken dip was to die for and I highly recommend it. Can't go wrong dining at Char Bar No 7."}
{"text":"Unbelieveable Noise.  Dirty floor. Everything's extra even the sides .. Even if side comes with your entree. 44.00 for two ..mediocre sandwiches and Two beers... Not going back....Meh..."}
{"text":"Love this porch area, dining area with the fireplace and TVs for sports events! Wonderful porch for year round enjoyment, even in the winter! Customer service is quite above normal for sure! The staff is accommodating and they work hard to make sure you get better than average service.  The food is very good but the salads need LESS spiral lettuce! It would be great if they'd offer butter lettuce! I'd pay more! Excellent burgers! I also enjoy the filet or the salmon, served on a sizzling plate! Yum! I really wish the management would think twice before allowing private parties to take entire porch. When you go and realize you can't enjoy the porch area, it's very very frustrating, especially when you're meeting several friends. We always leave so not we're not going as often now. Recommend but need to stop private parties on the porch."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to go with family. The outdoor seating area is nice. I would describe this as a more expensive Red Robin (typical American/burger fare) but not a huge difference in quality or taste. Our waitress was super attentive and on top of our water/Diet Coke refills (and didn't even laugh when I chugged my fourth one-- baby was up all night and I needed the caffeine boost ha). I can see us coming back here because it's in a good location, but given the choice I would probably go to Red Robin or something like that instead."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with a friend for lunch and we sat on the patio, which was nice even though humid outside.  I ordered the chicken tender salad and the honey mustard dressing was YUMMY!  My friend ordered a burger and it looked delicious.  Service was great, so overall, it was a good lunch!  I live too far to come here regularly and it wasn't super impressive for a drive, but it was nice to try!"}
{"text":"Monday was my husbands birthday so when he said he wanted a GOOD burger, I decided to take him here.  We arrived at 8:47pm and were quickly turned away by the host because even w all the people there and on the patio, they were closing the kitchen at 9!   Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't that leave us 13 minutes to order??   So disappointed considering we've never been here before.  Nor will we return.  Now my husband is a restaurant manager and if the kitchen is closing at 9, you have until 9 to place an order!  The place wasn't empty."}
{"text":"Wow. This place smells bad. That indicates dirtiness (and worse).   I was at the post office yesterday and was hungry so I bought a burger. It was completely devoid of flavor. While I was waiting on it, I was seated at the bar. It was lunchtime and absolutely no other customers were in the restaurant. Sitting at the bar I was hit with its stinkiness. Then the waitress comes up behind me and drops my to go package in front of me on the bar - without a single word (no 'thank you', no 'can I get you anything else', no 'have a good day') .... Nope. Nothing but attitude. I paid and left. I called and spoke with the manager. He sounded sleepy, like my call bothered him, and he couldn't be less concerned about my experience. WONT BE BACK!!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. Food and service were both on point. Burgers and steaks were cooked as ordered. The baked potato was outstanding, and the pretzels were good. Cocktails were a bit pricey, but well done and not watered down. I will be here again soon!"}
{"text":"We literally just walked out after sitting at our table over 10 minutes without a single glance from a server. There were no less than four servers standing around at a single table talking to each other. When we finally got up and left, there were another two just hanging out watching out the front window and another two hanging out at the hostess station. This happened about 5:20. For the prices they're asking, you would think they'd at least throw some water your direction when you sit down."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in CharBar recently.  They completely got rid of all of their daily food specials, as well as raised the price on some of our favorite menu items."}
{"text":"Very clean, parking is great. We got seated right away with 7 people. Server was friendly. Food was great. I was starving and was very short with staff because i was so hungry, like even when my burger came out wrong i didnt care because i was starving. The waiter was apologizing and was so kind. My burger was amazing and they were just trying to keep me happy by being attentative.Very good service, we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I would give this zero stars if I could! This isn't the first time this place has been displeasing! Tonight was the final breaking point!  We sat in an unpacked restaurant for nearly 10 min before I said anything or complained. Someone was smoking a cigar that was beyond smothering and every table around us was asked for or had already been served drinks/food or cleared tables as we sat with our menus waiting for services. Several servers made eye contact with us prior to us finally approaching the hostess stand complaining . We were seated in the center of the patio so it was pretty hard to miss us and the fact that when we asked for a manager he went back into the kitchen as if trying to avoid the situation..... never again- the service is a joke and the management is most certainly questionable- more like a joke!"}
{"text":"To be fair I ate at cowfish the night before and had the best damn cheeseburger of my life so I figured I would try one here. If the cook would have had the temp and pink throughout I think it may have been a tie. I got a medium which turned out to be close to well. Tator tots and margaritas saved the day. If they look into a burger chef they would win."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times now and consistently disappointed. Fish and chips were soft and soggy, the club sandwich worse. Probably an OK place to drink but I would avoid the food."}
{"text":"It's just OK. Beautiful new place, service OK, food disappointing other than their house salad. They should hire an actual chef to come up with a real menu then teach the line cooks how to do it."}
{"text":"I really like this place! We recently moved near by and finally had a chance to check it out the other week. Since then we have been back 3 times....in 2 weeks. Needless to say, we love the place. The daily drink specials are amazing and they food is good! Yes they have your usual bar food but they also have food food....like the kind that is delicious and fills you up. Our favorite is Tuesday night because you can get 2 steaks (and kind) with 2 salads and 2 sides for $36! The vibe is always fun and they have a great bar area and outdoor patio. Check it out!"}
{"text":"To my surprise the food was pretty good! Decided to try something new and near home to avoid heavy 5 o clock traffic. They perfectly had a Tuesday special. $36 Steak dinner for two with Steak of choice, great side salad, and choice of another side(good selections). Drink special was any flavor martini $6.  Chose NY strip and Filet Of Ribeye delicious! Very tender, well seasoned, and perfectly cooked to order! No joke they gave RC a little run for their money because they were darn near perfect! Tried the warm pretzels with beer cheese as an appetizer but it was just okay. The cheese was a little on the salty side. Would probably stick to entrees. Overall great experience for trying anew spot."}
{"text":"So bummed! This place has an AWESOME atmosphere, outdoor seating with a fire. We were so excited to try it out. The service was ok, but the food was unfortunately not good."}
{"text":"Great place the specials are fantastic, ask for Roy he'll make your experience exceptional"}
{"text":"Where do I start...it was a Monday night and my wifey and kiddo went to this fine establishment for dinner.  We have been to the Char Bar in Matthews several times and have always been pleased however, tonight wasn't as pleasing.  We were quickly seated and given menus, then we waited...and waited...and waited.  Approximately 10-15 minutes with not even being acknowledged before the manager made her rounds to check on everyone although, several staff members walked right by us seemingly trying to not look our way.  Great that she did, note to self, if I ever open a restaurant execute the manager making rounds strategy.  I told her we had not been helped or even acknowledged.  She quickly took our drink orders and was back in a couple of minutes with our server.  Our server was nice and responsive, he did forget a couple of things but not a deal breaker.  He was nice and attentive.  The interesting thing was the ratio of wait staff to tables was close to 1:1.  Odd that there were that many servers to tables but once you saw them catch up on all of there chatter you realized they needed to beef up the help to allow everyone to chat.  Exactly 40 minutes, thats right FORTY minutes after we were seated our food arrived.  Nothing complicated, chicken, kids steak and a salad.  It was all very well cooked but dang, after 40 minutes I could have screwed it all up five times and had plenty of time to fix it.  I pointed out our wait time to the server and the manager quickly came over and both apologized.  They reduced the bill and continued to apologize so I was okay with that.  It was their first week being open so I give them credit on their recovery and would recommend giving them a shot...I will."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service. Extensive menu. Various dinner items orders, had plenty of left overs, that were great heated next day. Server went extra mile to make sure that the children dinning with us were served promptly and all needs meet, a big plus!! Outdoor dinning looked inviting but opted to stay inside. Restaurant clean and updated."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, this was a great dinner experience! Went on a Sunday night - not too busy. There's giant flat screen tv's everywhere so no need to fret about missing the game :) my boyfriend and I went with a GroupOn and was able to get A TON of food. We ordered the full rack of ribs, mushroom risotto, Brussels sprouts, tilapia fish tacos, and tater tots. Everything was so good! The only two things that weren't my absolute favorite were the risotto (a little underdone for my taste) and the Brussels sprouts (cooked whole, wish they would cut them in half to make them a little more tender). Overall, a great casual bar food experience :)"}
{"text":"Went here back in the summer and enjoyed it. We had a great waitress and they were cool when I wanted to send my wings back for some extra crispiness.  They have a great patio, one side has tables and the other has couches with a large fireplace.  One wall of windows also opens up like a garage door to get that outdoor feeling. My only complaint was the music in the bar area was so loud, you couldnt hear your date or the waitress."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for a relaxing casual dinner with friends! Good hangout for locals! Food is good and service is excellent."}
{"text":"We have been eating here for years and it seems that the food and the service have steadily gone downhill. Tonight was the last night I will eat at Char Bar7. We're officially breaking up for good this time.  The last few times the food was barely edible. Tonight, the blue cheese Coleslaw was rancid. My husband and I both had it as a side item. We brought it to the attention of our waiter and he sent the manager over. She proceeded to tell us that the KM (thanks for the jargon) tried it and it was fine. I suggested that if she was familiar with how it was to taste for her to try it. She left pretty hastily and then come back and  said she tried it and the bar back (thanks again) did too and it was fine. She explained it's made with real blue cheese crumbles. Well, maybe so but those crumbles tasted like they had been left out in today's 80 degree weather.  She offered to take it off our bill. I appreciate that but the food and attitude are enough to make me take my money elsewhere. Eater beware!"}
{"text":"Mostly pleased with this reasonably priced neighborhood restaurant.  Great pimento cheese burger.  Sweet potato tater tots were very good and would have been great if they were piping hot.  Good drink prices.  The only bummer was the waitress started talking about dessert while we were eating dinner and took up plates way too early without being asked.  Clearly pushing us out and it was embarrassing to my friend who hadnt finished.  Ill go back but next time I won't allow our very nice experience to be short changed.  It's a fun and cozy atmosphere and most people like to be able to take an hour to eat a meal without feeling rushed."}
{"text":"I friggin love this place for dinners with my family and a drink at the bar. The burgers are excellent as are the onion rings and other items. They have several different types of burgers that are delicious. They have a nice beer selection, local crafts and national ones. The bartenders and wait staff are all really nice as well."}
{"text":"Love the live music Wednesday and Friday nights! The food is only pretty good but the environment is great! We love all of the staff, especially Kelly and Paul! Definitely recommend it as a place for a drink after work!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. The atmosphere not bad...very loud even when there are not a ton of people...too many tvs with volume up at once plus music so people talking over it. The food often comes a little over cooked...I get it \"char\" bar...its more then just the outside char though...burgers end up a little dry...and tots at all levels of cooked...but they are incredibly attentive and if something isn't perfect they will bend over backwards to see that you are happy. They have a decent beer selection and apps not bad...didn't love the pretzels though, very dry."}
{"text":"Frequent this place. Excellent bar with excellent bar food and more! The service is always wonderful and friendly."}
{"text":"Finally!! A good steak in Matthews!! Decent prices, nice atmosphere, and good food. Beef, Burgers, and Beer are all good."}
{"text":"This was my 1St time coming here and I wasn't disappointed. The server was outstanding and very attentive to our tables needs. There isn't anything as welcoming as a server anticipating what you need before you need it. The lunch crowd was slow so that helped. I had the ribs and my French dip with tater tots. The food was a little above average for sports bar style food. As a first time guess I would go back and suggest it to other."}
{"text":"When this went in, i was hoping it would be a go to place for me, as it's close to the house.  They have a decent beer selection.  The food is good as well.  It just takes so long to get your food.  It's not the fault of the staff.  They have a small kitchen and it just takes longer to cook the food.  I go there sometimes to watch football. I still get take out wings occasionally, but I get them naked, and make my own buffalo sauce.  Yes, too lazy to cook them myself, but when I do, they're awesome."}
{"text":"Went to the bar for a drink. The bar tender gave me a cold look which I ignored.  I asked for a wine list and ordered Pinot Noir. She said \"we don't have that one we have...\" so I ordered it. I drank finished. She asked do you want another. I replied no. Just tell me why I had to wait an additional 10 minutes + to pay. I had to ask, well that's your tip because I sure as hell did not leave one. I looked forward to going here but after this poor customer service I WILL NOT BE BACK."}
{"text":"solid food! great atmosphere and Mallory was fantastic and made the night a blast! We were from out of town and decided to watch the WS here and we were not disappointed. Ask for Mallory!!!"}
{"text":"This area in general has really been built up over the last few years, and Char Bar is a reasonable addition. It's a few steps above your standard fast food, and even a bit more than Smashburger and Five Guys as well - certainly a place you can go to sit down if you're in the mood for a burger but want something a bit more substantial.  With that in mind, the atmosphere is nice, and staff is helpful, but they really need to be, as the service can be on the slow side. The good news is that once it gets to you, the servings are somewhat generous, which helps.  Menu options are plentiful, with tater tots and salads too. Nice patio and bar area if you don't want to just sit an another booth that you won't recall which restaurant you were in a few minutes after you've left."}
{"text":"After a very lengthy wait, the CharBar in Mint Hill has finally opened to significant attention. Seems like every time by there are rather large crowds. On a recent weekend night, they wait was approaching an hour, according to the hosts, so rather than stand around for a table, we decided to hang out on the patio. They have a nice setup where they will text you when your table is ready, so you don't have to lug around one of those pager things. Think about that - it hasn't been long since those came out, and already they have moved on to something else. Wonder what they would do if you don't have a phone on you? Anyway.  We settled in, and the patio is a nice area - too bad it's right on Highway 51, because even at this relatively tame hour, there is plenty of traffic. You didn't want to tell the musician to turn up his sound, because with the dull roar from the crowd and the sound he was making, along with the cars moving along, it was already too loud to have any sort of conversation. Unfortunately, it took them a while to get any part of our order out, and when they did it wasn't correct - since we had ordered a few appetizers while we waited, and likely do to the aforementioned noise, some of them didn't make it. Maybe we should have just said \"one of each\". Instead, we got something we didn't order, and when we pointed it out, it took a looooong time to get a replacement.  The good news is that the manager - or someone who seemed concerned, who may or may not have been involved - came to check on us, when the server did not. And eventually, the food came out, but by then we were full, so we just asked for the check. That took an even longer time. And someone else told us that we dropped one of the phones on the floor. Good news is that it didn't break - nice to know, as we were on a high table and it was a solid four feet to concrete, so that would have been a bad thing.  All in all, since they are a new location, it was the first week and they were slammed, it's not horrible - but there are still some kinks. If you love CharBar, then it's probably about what you would expect. But it still may have a ways to go yet, so if you don't love 'em, or haven't tried yet, you might want to wait a while and give them a chance to work out the kinks."}
{"text":"Parking lot is pretty hectic so it might be hard to find a space. We were sat within 5 mins. Decor and restaurant was nice and updated. We got the blackened chicken nachos (half order) and they were huge! More than enough for 2 people. The queso was good and cheesy. It had black beans and pico with cut up pieces of chicken. I got hot wings as my meal. Flavor was good and spicy. Not buttery flavor which I like! Wings were medium sized. Ranch was good. My fiancé got the leap year burger. It was on an English muffin (larger than a regular one). It had beef, cheese, fried egg, bacon and lettuce and tomato. Egg was a little runny. Yolk was already dripping on the burger and it seeped on the bottom of the bun making it soggy. He liked that the English muffin was used but said it was almost not big enough to hold everything up. His burger kept breaking apart. I saw a manager stop by each table asking how everything is. Little gestures like that show you care about your customers. Tracy was our server and she was awesome and very informative about the menu! Only flaw I noticed was the bathroom. There were paper towels all over the floor as if it wasn't checked for a while. Other than that I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Had a really positive experience here. Our server Derek was great and very informative. He was enthusiastic and gave great service! Food was delicious. I ate my whole meal and so did everyone else! I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to get a drink. Food is pretty good, too, although I can't say I've tried much on their menu. I love the outdoor patio, very comfortable seating & a nice ambiance. We like to come here to relax after work."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service, manager kept coming to the table to check on us and Rhett was awesome, good teamwork between the waiters thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"It's expensive and the food is just okay.   ...but I still love the place. They have a good selection of drafts and the outdoor patio is very nice. The bartenders are great and do a great job of keeping it loose and fun, while keeping things family friendly in a nod to the overall relaxed vibe. They have all of the sports packages for us transplants. It's really something for everyone without compromise."}
{"text":"Dining at Char Bar No.7 will not disappoint you. They have an excellent patio for every season of the year. They have good drink specials to the craft burger of the week. I love dining at Char Bar No.7 because the food is always good and the servers are always friendly."}
{"text":"We ate with friends and I had a smokehouse burger. I ordered medium rare. The burger was very well done. I ordered another one. It took an extended time for the replacement. The three other people had finished their food quite awhile before the burger arrived. It was medium well. My friend was disspointed with her tuna. The staff was very slow to respond to my burger problem. I well spend my money somewhere else. Lot's of choices."}
{"text":"Char Bar No. 7 could very well be poised to steal the \"Best Burger in Charlotte\" crown from The Liberty.  I felt the need for a burger, and wanted to try somewhere new, so CB7 is what was decided.  I was skeptical of the hokey name - and the steer antlers on the wall - but was quite surprised by the quality this place is putting out.  As others have said, they do have a very elegant patio, which you walk through to get to the restaurant proper.  Wrought iron tables on one side, couches and a huge stone fireplace on the other.  Inside has more of the traditional western bar feel: dark wood, \"aged\" wall decor, and plenty of cowboy-type things.  The bar area is pretty big (and pretty noisy), and there is also a dining room as well.  We started with the appetizer of the night, a charred portabello mushroom. It had that great smoky, open flame quality that surprisingly did not overpower the delicate, mellow flavor of the mushroom. Everything meshed well with the tomato, feta, and arugula that came with it.  My burger was perfectly cooked, with a warm pink interior and loads of juicy flavor, just how I prefer it. A rich, toasted bun helped solidify the sandwich, and my particular burger (there are plenty to choose from) came loaded with lettuce, tomato, onion, and fried pickles.  Yes, fried pickles - could it get any better?  Indeed it can! There is a great selection of NC beers to wash it down with.  Our server was spot-on, and the service manager personally followed up with every table.  Seeing as how I only had one of their many burger options, I think it's safe to say I'll be back to sample through the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"My family and I are regulars here. Service is always good as well as the food. The CB7 salad is my absolute favorite!!"}
{"text":"Never, ever had a bad experience here. Between me and my boyfriend, we have tried every (beef) burger on the menu. They're ALL delicious. GREAT SERVICE ALWAYS! Tracy is our favorite. She's awesome. Every server we've had has possessed a positive attitude! Definitely give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and nice staff. The food is ok but nothing special. Wifes steak was tough and overcooked. Bar is too small and for some reason you can't order a meal at the outside patio.  Hopefully it gets better!"}
{"text":"Went to Char Bar No 7 in Mint Hill last night with a few friends.  I have been maybe 3 times previously and was always mostly pleased.  This time the experience was absolutely wonderful.  The staff was on point for everything, and the gentleman that I assumed to be the GM gave us extra care.  The food was great and our drinks were kept full as we needed.  We sat later in the fireplace area and listened to a singer play and sing songs.  Had a really wonderful time there."}
{"text":"They have tots! Gotta love a good tot-they have the regular white potato and sweet potato with a honey butter that is to die for.   Another point in their favor is any burger you want is served on a Gluten-free bun if you need that. Generous salads, big full bar area, and my favorite Palmetto Cheese appetizer. Pimento cheese, guacamole, and salsa-trio with chips   They have this huge outdoor patio area with a fireplace. It is covered and has heat lamps so it is even nice in the frigid Charlotte winters!"}
{"text":"Please don't bother eating here.  Mediocre food and service and their \"Billionaire Margarita\" consists of Jose Cuervo tequila?  Too bad as it is a local spot...I will NOT be going back.  Don't waste your $$$.  Queen City Q is much better and just across the street."}
{"text":"Officially gave up on this place last night.  I was excited when it first opened in Mint Hill because we needed a slightly upscale place to dine.  The first few times we ate there it was just okay and the service was bad but I just figured it was \"opening\" jitters and gave them some more time and came back later.  Later was no better.  I had the best chicken tenders ever at the Char Bar in Matthews so I asked if they could replicate them at the Mint Hill store.  Easy enough right?  WRONG!  I asked if they breaded them to order and she said \"sure.\"  So I ordered them, they came back like I'd asked for DOUBLE breading.  Sent them back and explained what I wanted again.  Came back with even more breading, I gave up and they took them off the check.  Came back about a month later to basically a new staff so I tried again.  Same thing, Groundhog Day.  Gave up, they took them off the check again.  Came back about a month later to yet another staff.  This time I asked if they could lightly bread fish for the fish and chips.  Same thing, double breading, sent it back, they tried again, same result, took it off the check and apologized.  So last night, I got the wings, I like the wings usually.  They came out soft, I asked the server if they could just drop them in for a minute and crisp them up, knowing that the fry cook is obviously \"challenged\" I took a chance.  15 minutes later, they came out black, so overdone that the waitress was apologizing as she sat them in front of me.  Took a bite, they sucked, told her to take them off the check and she did.  No apology.    We spend a lot of money when we go, always a bottle or two of wine and cocktails.  Average check for 3 is about $130 AFTER they take my entree off the check.  Make no mistake, this place flat out sucks EVERY TIME.  I wanted it to be good so bad because it's so close to my home at Olde Sycamore that I kept coming back and back, hoping and hoping.  The burger was decent once but that's pretty hard to screw up even for them.  But that's it..  Nope we'll make the drive to Waverly, Matthews, Ballantyne, Southpark ect..  Just to avoid this place.  \"The Hill\" has fabulous food but no wine selections, otherwise we would be eating there.  Best part about this place, it's \"pet friendly\" on the patio.  Worst part about this place, it serves food.  ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.  NO STARS.."}
{"text":"Decided to give Char Bar another try.  I had a grilled chicken salad.  I now understand what \"rubber chicken\" dinner means.  2 bites and I didn't touch the rest of it.  Never tasted anything like it. No one asked how is dinner?  Our server did not notice that most of the meat was still on the plate.  I think the restaurant is so busy that do not need to take any pride in their work.  Managements obvious lack of concern about quality speaks.  Their is such little competition in Mint Hill that there seems to be room for an attractive building with lousy food."}
{"text":"Went with a large group we tried to call ahead but were told when we called that you could only do that two or more hours ahead. So we did not get put on the wait list till we got there. Got there close to 9 pm and the wait was 30 -40 mins , not too bad considering we had a group.  Inside the decor was nice but it was way too loud. We had to speak very loudly just to be heard across a 2.5 foot wide table. Which was one of those high tables which I find uncomfortable.  When ordering I ordered from a section called PLATED (see pic). Under the section's title it says ( Served with one side) with a list of sides under the section.  Each item in the section is listed in bold with a discrimination of the dish under the name of the item.  One would think that you get the described dish and you get to pick one of the sides listed. If you thought that you would be wrong. I ordered the Fish AND Chips. Well when I said what side I wanted I was told the chips part of the (Fish AND Chips) was my side. Again see pic. One of the items description said served with a mixed green salad. I guess that was the side for that one. And I guess the chicken finger plate the side is honey mustard dipping sauce.  So for two small pieces of cod and some potato chips with a sweet tea (notice in the pic the glass was empty, that happened a lot which is a sin in the hot south) the cost was just over $20 before tip.  Overall it was just ok. And plan to bring your phone because that's how they let you know your table is ready (you have to give your phone number) plus you will need your phone to text the people at the table with you cause you can't hear what they are saying."}
{"text":"They seem to be struggling with customer service. Ordered appetizer but it didn't get delivered until meal was delivered. Waiter didn't come around much. Manger came by and asked how things were going. They credited the appetizer. The waiter and managers were very nice . The food was really good ."}
{"text":"I had the grilled shrimp green salad, and it was delicious. I also enjoyed a taste of my friend's mushroom risotto, delicious and very cheesy. I'm looking forward to trying everything else on the menu, especially the vegetables!"}
{"text":"My first and last visit was terrible...long wait for waitress to come to our table. She had to return multiple times to verify our order. Then forgot to put it in the system. While we waited for our food a group of people had a puppy at the bar! It was walking around the seating area and climbing on the couch. Then 2 waitress came by and played with and petted the dog before grabbing a tray and picking up drinks. All this and the overpriced food wasn't all that good."}
{"text":"Great service. The food was good. The drinks were so so. But the service was so good I'd would so go back. We ordered the southern burger and bean burger. Bean burger was huge and you can tell or it seemed very natural yet hearty. Nothing like normal vegan foods. The southern burger was typical but well made. The signature drinks on the other hand need some work. More of a selection and maybe lighter or better balance of the booze would be better. Overall 5++ outta 5 for outstanding service. 3.5 for the food and 3 for the drinks."}
{"text":"1st time here and so far so good. The ambiance is beautiful and the staff is nice. I can't stop picturing the layout, that fireplace, the service and everything. A must visit. Food was spectacular. Thanks Alex/Steve our waiter......"}
{"text":"Stopped by today, Sunday, the people were friendly, and our waiter was excellent. However,  the whole point in coming here was for the burgers and they HAVE NO TASTE. The meat is very bland but for $11.00 you would expect a burger that had a great \"char\" taste... like their name but it didn't.  The tomatoes,  onions etc is all you taste... because the meat is so bland.  I'm giving two stars out of five for shockingly bland taste of the meat. Places like five guys, cookout or DD peckers have burgers that taste amazing. Char 7 you need to step up!"}
{"text":"Place was cute and quaint.  Southwestern Salad is amazing.  Highly recommended!  Service was very good as well.  I'll be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"This is my new fave restaurant. Food was awesome and the service was even better. I had the bourbon salmon and steamed broccoli which came with a house salad. I did request a side of the bourbon dressing because I really like to taste my glaze (drench my glaze ). The salad was their regular house salad that came with cheese, tomatoes and bacon. I chose a apple cider vinaigrette dressing which was everything!!!!!!  All of  the food was very fresh and tasted amazing. Both managers came to my table to see if I enjoyed the food and to ask about the service which was both on separate occasions. My server was Amanda and she also made my experience one to remember!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday midday for lunch I been there 5 times and had bad experiences always I had burgers to pastes and I can say it's over priced and the service to match the places is horrible the server are horrible I waited about 10 min once being seated for a waitress to approach us then our food taste like it's been sitting or it has been reheated. Once I ran out of my drink you would think that she would refill it sorry to inform you she was talking to her fellow Co workers she had only two tables I don't understand   Never again don't go people you will waste your money not worth it at all   Management need to fix this"}
{"text":"Great spot to watch football! GO Panthers! Went for the game, they had good drink specials and I like how the app menu has a small and large size. We ordered the wings which were decent.. menu is typical bar food and somewhat similar to hickory tavern."}
{"text":"Have ate here probably twice a week for several years.  Tonight was the last time.  Went in and ordered well done steaks. They came out rare.  Sent one of them back and it came back out the same way. Complained to the management and all they said was would you like a box.  Everyone makes mistakes but that's sure not how I would handle it. I will never eat or recommend anyone I know to eat there again. I spent 65.00 for two steaks I wouldn't feed my dog. Thanks for your help management staff"}
{"text":"Lots to like here - good food, good service, good atmosphere, good location (at least for me:).  I love the French Dip because it is simple and is very tasty.  It isn't loaded with rabbit food which may cause a few people to turn up their noses.  I've tried another couple sandwiches, which were very good as well but I the FD is the regular.  Also, I love the tots, fried pickles, and as of this latest visit - the charbroiled wings!  The better half loves the burgers, Southwest especially.  Only thing keeping it from being a weekly, or more, frequent, is the price - it's a reasonable night out if eating in and enjoying all that the place has to offer but a little high for just sandwiches."}
{"text":"I was invited to Char Bar No 7 to help a friend celebrate her birthday.  I headed out from Plaza-Midwood and drove and drove some more.   I was beginning to think that I was out in the country and that Char Bar must be some little fruit stand by the road.  But, I happened across a shopping center and there it was. I was fortunate to be able to sample their jalapeño pimento spread.  Scrumptious!  For my entree, I chose the large house salad with no bacon and blue cheese dressing.  There was a design your own salad section, but I am so indecisive I would have been there long after my friends had left, trying to design my meal.  So many choices! So, next time that I feel like a jaunt into the country, I may motor Char Bar way.  A delightful experience that bears repeating."}
{"text":"Great music, burgers, drinks and cozy. Good for a first date  great little place, can't wait to try it again."}
{"text":"CharBar 7s (there are a few now) appear to be trying to overtake The Hickory Tavern's local pub model.  They have similar, upscale sportsbar & grill atmospheres.  The menus could very easily be copy/pasted from each other.  The service is average, as is the experience overall.  The one big differentiator I've noticed between the two places so far is, CharBar7 usually has a nice loungey, outdoor/patio type area that is pretty nice to chill in.  Bottom line for me though is that the food just underdelivers.  It's just okay pub food.  Reading the menu, you're like - 'oh yea, that could be hella good', but then when it arrives, inevitably you wind up a bit dissapointed.  I too would echo my other yelpers on the service as well, unfortunately.  It's just not justifiable to be that inept, slow, and generally stand-off-ish.  You literally have an opportunity to make this THE local pub for about 500 homes within a 2 mile radius.  The way to do that?  have a decent venue (check) and KILL IT with service.  With remarkable service, people wouldn't notice the high price tags or average food."}
{"text":"Finally getting around to my review for the CharBar.  Never had a problem before but this time my guest & I both ordered salads.  Both of them were made with iceberg lettuce.  Neither of them were supposed to be.  Didn't send it back because I don't send much back.  That's simply a cost cutting technique & completely inexcusable.  I doubt I will return."}
{"text":"The food quality is very good. I'm here every week especially since they are now open for lunch. It's becoming very popular. Rightfully so."}
{"text":"Nice patio and good food, friendly fast service too. Good beer selection and desserts are delicious. I had the ahi tuna salad and the fish was nice quality, the salad itself was a bit oily but tasty. Steaks seemed over cooked but salmon and sides done well. Worst thing is the acoustics are very bad and it's incredibly loud. The porch is great but your right on the road so lots of traffic."}
{"text":"Both times I've been here have had fairly underwhelming experiences. The food is something similar to a TGI Fridays or Chili's, in my opinion.  The pretzel app is pretty satisfying, however.  Service is good. We recently were there for lunch and a very sweet girl took care of us.  I do like the patio and would opt to dine alfresco when possible.  Overall, it's just not my beat. But when a working lunch is in order, I do prefer it to the Panera close by."}
{"text":"Terrible.  Came to watch the Panthers game with my daughter and after a drunk woman took our seats, I was told I was in the wrong.  A \" manager\" Tony Donnelson came out to our section and yelled at us when everyone on the patio witnessed what happened.  He was unprofessional and acted like a bouncer not a manager.  He saw he was making my daughter cry and continued to confront us until I suggested to speak inside.  At this point I took my crying daughter and left.  Didn't receive any apology or even told who I was speaking to.  I had to request information to speak to a GM and was given the store number.  Never have I been treated this way and my daughter is still upset.  Tony Donnelson should be ashamed of himself!"}
{"text":"Great french dip...a lot of bread but very fresh bread...only reason for average rating is price seems to be about 25% high for a bar bar...I get they are going for an upscale neighborhood pub deal...but I had a french dip and 4 cocktails and came out with an $80 bill with tip"}
{"text":"EDIT: I hate to say this, because the soft opening set the restaurant up for so much potential and I wanted this to be a great new spot in Mint Hill.   I've gone back three times since my initial review, each time hoping it was just an \"off day\" for the Char Bar staff. Unfortunately, it seems pretty consistent. It's almost as if the restaurant is functioning in slow motion. Each time I've gone since the soft opening, we are seated and it's a 15 minute wait until a drink is placed in front of you. This has been a mixture of not having staff attend to the table quickly and putting in a drink order that takes an extremely long time. I've never been on a night where it was overly busy by any means, so I can't figure out what the issue is. The service doesn't improve after that though, last night we weren't served our entrees for 45 minutes after ordering...they were both salads. One had grilled chicken and one was a salmon patty (the salad was served with grilled salmon making it an even longer wait on top of that for the correct protein), but it should not have taken that long.  Something is just not coming together at this location. I'm not sure if the staff needs to be better trained, the manager needs to be more involved or the communication needs to improve between front and back of house...but something needs to change. Glancing through the other reviews it seems like this is pretty consistent. I would love to see it turn around!"}
{"text":"Bad food and worse mgmt. who did nothing  me when Both parts of my meal were under or over- cooked. NEVER returning!"}
{"text":"Ordered filet medium, filet came out rare, had to go back 3 times to kitchen to get it right. Waitress and Manager could not care one bit.  I finished my meal before my wife got the steak back right. Someone who cooks for a living should know how to cook a steak medium.  There's this thing called a thermometer that tells you how done a steak is. It's not that difficult."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Our waiter Donnie did and outstanding job taking care of my dad and I tonight. We both ordered the build your own salad. The ingredients were all fresh and we received our food within 7 minutes or so. I would highly recommend eating here. Ask for Donnie!"}
{"text":"A good place for a drink and a steak. Atmosphere was nice. Not too crowded when I was there. We sat in the bar area at a high top. Friend pickles were good. Steak was excellent. Mashed potatoes and asparagus also good."}
{"text":"Nice location with good food and friendly staff and great service. We stopped by during lunch. We ordered burgers, fries and drinks. The burgers were great as were the fries. We were content and if ever in the area again, we will be sure to stop in."}
{"text":"It's pretty safe to say this is just a regular bar with regular mediocre food. Nothing to special. We decided to stop in here only because we never heard of this place and seen it in passing. So we decided to give it a try. First off i  do want to mention the staff here was super friendly. I believe our waitress and the manager checked up on us over 1,000 times while we were here. Also we were shocked to sit and have a conversation with the chef as he came out to explain to us some of the items they ran out of  from the menu due to the mothers day rush earlier. I ordered the Neptune crab cake and shrimp salad, my significant other ordered the ribs. Starting out my salad the one thing about this salad i absolutely could not get enough of was the crab cake omg heaven!  The shrimp were okay nothing to brag about they weren't the normal shrimp served in the salad because again the chef explained the shortage on certain items earlier as we entered. My significant other ordered the ribs, i asked him how did he like his ribs on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the best he gave them a 4 to 5. The set up when you arrive here is really lax in the front with the front screened in patio area which was a nice touch to this what appears to be maybe a neighborhood bar."}
