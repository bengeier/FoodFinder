{"text":"I went to the Queen St West location by CTV studio as we had a great visit at  AGO and we were looking for a place to eat.  We came across Hopscotch and I ordered Sweet Potato Zen and my friend ordered Lucha Libre and both were the freshest ingredients and very filling and so delicious.  The staff was friendly made recommendations if you did not like an items in the bowls.

I recommend this place and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Update: went back 2 days later and got the same Kimchi bowl I previously raved about. This time it was not as flavourful, and contained a minuscule amount of ingredients compared to rice ratio... It was mostly all rice! 

The fact that the two experiences were night and day is extremely alarming. How could they be that inconsistent? It just shows me that they don't value a high quality product. 

I'm not sure if I'd be back. I'm scared to pay $15 for a mediocre bowl of rice. Feels like I'm playing roulette with this place!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 times. 
First time rice was on the hard side. 
Second time thought I'd give it another go and it was really good! 
Third time hard rice again.

 For the price not worth rolling the dice."}
{"text":"I tried this place at Scotia Plaza a few times since June (2017).  Looks like they may have worked out some of the kinks from their early days.  I found the service very good.  I like that I can amend any ingredient in what you order.  The Lucha Libre and the Avocado Cobber are my favourite.  Very nice flavours.  I replace the rice with quinoa and the lettuce with spinach. I agree with others that the prices are a bit high compared to other options in the downtown area but  you do get lot of food so I tend to keep part of it for my 5pm snack when I am working late.  They should consider offering half portions."}
{"text":"Another new \"healthy box\" location in the path. It didn't look much different from all the other places, but since it was new, I figured I'd give it a try. 

Upon arrival, I noticed that all the rice bowls were at least $11+ before tax and most were over $12. The two chicken ones I was looking at were over $13. That struck me as pretty expensive. 

I ordered the kimchi bowl. The staff seemed a bit new and not so well versed with what goes in which bowl yet. I was also asked 3-4 to confirm my order. It took a while to finally get my food. 

The portions are definitely big, but most of it is rice/quinoa anyways. I don't think it's really worth the hefty price and long waits, especially when other places that sell almost identical things are cheaper and better."}
{"text":"Okay but expensive food
This is my second time ordering from Ritual. First time I got the avocado toast and this time the Avocado Cobber Salad. Both times, I felt the sizes were too small for the prices that they charged. For $14, the avocado Cobber Salad came with maple balsamic vinegrette, mixed creamy yogurt salad dressing. Ritual allowed you to add one more salad dressing so I got the lemon vinegrette (bad mix as I forgot abt the balsamic vinegrette so the salad ended up tasting a bit sour). The salad itself consisted of mesclun (really just some salad greens), spinach, thin slices of carrots, cucumber, broutons, small egg slices, chicken, bacon, and a few chewy croutons. The chicken was okay, bacon was better bc they didn't cheap out by giving bacon bits. Croutons were chewy but ended up becoming soggy after being dipped in the dressing for too long. I took out the blue cheese as I'm not a cheese fan and another Yelper suggested previously to take it out. Then there's the size. I have small hands and the salad bowl was only slightly bigger than my hand.  Overall, everything about this place is just a-okay, nothing special, nothing troublesome to eat. If you're on your spring diet and has the extra cash to blow, this place would be perfect. 

Btw they don't offer paper bags to help you carry your food. If you ended up ordering too much or you're bringing food for other ppl, you're left on your own."}
{"text":"I tried to Sweet Potato Zen.  It was a very generous portion and tasted pretty good (minus the pickled onions which I forget to omit).  The person behind me in line commented that you can make you own bowls but there was no signage.  My bowl was $12 + tax which is pretty pricey for a veggie bowl (with a few pieces of tofu).  I wish they posted the calories ..."}
{"text":"I need to take two stars away from a four-star rating.  The original staff was really fantastic and is greatly missed.  Since the new year both the manager and staff have turned over.  The new staff is inexperienced and struggling.  The person who acts as if they're the new manager has alienated most of my co-workers and out-of-town guests who used to flock there in droves.  A large number of business people do not eat onion during the workday to protect their breath for afternoon meetings.  Apparently the request for no onion cannot be met and will get you attitude for asking.  The consistency of the smoothies is off as well, they're pretty watery now."}
{"text":"Decided to stop and try this quaint little spot in the ScotiaPlaza. My co-worker swears by them and every morning gets their avocado toast.

I was not disappointed, the avocado toast was everything I expected and more. The ingredients were fresh, the presentation was good, and the service was top notch. 

If your're looking for a healthy alternative to greasy breakfast sandwiches  than, definitely give this a try."}
{"text":"Having walked past the long lineups and beautiful people promoting this place in Scotia Plaza, I thought I'd give it a try.  Turns out it may be more hype than anything else.

The long lines are one thing, but it seems like they still haven't figured out how to keep it moving.  Inefficiency aside, the staff were quite friendly and generally very helpful.  As far as the food went, I ordered the Kimchi Kick with extra chicken, which came to $18.50 (pretty high for a lunch).  Unfortunately it didn't have much of a kick, was filled with mostly carbs (brown rice and bread) and bland chicken.  

Don't think I'll be hopping off to wait in line here anytime soon."}
{"text":"I ordered the hazelnut butter and honey on toast this morning. I've had the avocado toast and the purple reign, and both were delightful. But the hazelnut toast is SOOO GOOD! I ordered it on Ritual, and didn't notice the notification that it would take a little longer than usual. I walked over, and when I got there I was told the hazelnut spread wasn't ready yet (as in, they were making it fresh...). I waited about five minutes - which wasn't an issue - but the customer service really impressed me. I ordered an almond milk cappuccino while I waited (btw, Ritual says they've only got milk and soy, but happily, they also have almond milk!) and the lovely woman filling my order said there would be no change for the coffee because of the wait. This kind of customer service is rare, and it did not go unnoticed. Give this one a try :)"}
{"text":"The type of salad that is on the heavier side.

I got the avocado cobber and asked for no crutons. Lady taking me order had to ask me twice about it, and once more by the salad tossing guy.

It comes with an ok amount of food for $15.25 after tax, considering that it had plenty of chicken and bacon. Ive had vegetarian salad in dt core for similar price.

The place during lunch time is just a disaster, so many people and so unorganized.

The salad itself was pretty good. The blue cheese was definitely VERY strong so unless you're a die hard blue cheese fan, i recommend you taking it out.

The salad tossing people were SLOW and they had their mouth wide open talking and pointing down while they were tossing..."}
{"text":"Sittin here eatin now. Gotta make this quick. Foods so good service is great! Best window for people watching but like bro turn the AC on its summer and you got all glass windows everywhere legit a healthy spot for lunch but like also a legit greenhouse. I'm sweatin and outta here"}
{"text":"Ordered via UberEats.

I ordered a quinoa salad which I found heavily salted and had to throw out half way. It was a decent portion but got pretty pricy when you add the protein on top of the base salad.

I also got some toasts (avocado as well as the cream cheese jelly one) which were both generously loaded with toppings if you're in the mood for toast.

I was hoping to find a new go-to salad place but this place isn't it!"}
{"text":"I passed by this new Green Healthy eating place a few times and decided to give it a try. I thought it focus on Kale because it has a big signage \"Dear Kale\" in the store. I also saw Kale is in most of the menu. 

I told the staff that I was first time there and \"hope\" she would give me a short intro about their shop but she just continued working on her \"work\". When I decided to order, another staff decided to ask the male customer in front of me if he was served. When he said he was served, she just ignored me and didn't ask me the same question! OK fine, I waved my hand and signal her that I wanted to order. 

Then, the staff asked me my name with a voice that only she or the person next to her could hear. I repeated twice and the other staff helped her getting my name. Then she continued using the same voice to ask me if I wanted to add \"whatever\" in my Bowl. I said \"whatever\" because I couldn't hear 90% of the time when she asked. Then the cashier was so lay back as if he didn't feel like working there. 

OK, when the service was not right, I hope at least the food was good. Sweet Potato Zen $11 was I ordered. First of all, the bowl only got a few pieces of shredded Kale, but it was fine because the kale was very hard I would say. The combination of the ingredients were not balanced and texture were very mushy. The bread (I guess it was gluten free) was not yummy. I didn't enjoy the meal at all. 

For $13.5 with tax, I would prefer going to other green eating place."}
{"text":"Hop to it with hopscotch. 

I got the Kale Caesar Salad (ate it too quickly so I'll take a picture next time). The salad had a great blend of ingredients that kept the salad interesting as I was making my way through it (bacon, corn, crispy chickpeas, chicken, parmesan, kimchi). The dressing was pleasant, but I could feel it weighing down on me towards the end. 

The lines can be long so I recommend Ritual-ing your order. 

I want to try their toasts next!"}
{"text":"This place is so unreliable. They changed their hours so they open very late compared to every other store in the PATH. Their equipment is always broken - they haven't been able to make smoothies for over a week due to a broken blender. Just buy a new blender?! I don't get it. I've tried 3 times in the past 3 weeks to visit their establishment and every time I've been unable to order what I wanted. Not going back."}
{"text":"What a bad experience we had, lack of care and manager presence. All their effort went into making their space presentable instead of training the staff about their food and drinks. 

Poor value for green smoothie, chunks found and when I brought it to their attention, no one could care less. 

Never again."}
{"text":"I eat here every day for lunch. Healthy, Fresh ingredients, friendly staff, quick. Highly recomend."}
