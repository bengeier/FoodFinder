{"text":"I've been here a few times and I usually know what to expect...average but somewhat satisfying Carribbian food. Today I was disappointed. The curried chicken roti was terrible..the roti shell is different than what they've had in the past, less authentic than before. The curry part of the roti didn't have a great flavor either..all around disappointing for an expensive fast food dinner"}
{"text":"Now I understand why the food is only so so.

Start with a massive pot, throw in ingredients and probably cook till just ready. Package in single serve freezer bags and ship out to stores. 

That way, even toy can own a franchise."}
{"text":"Food is good here. Live the oxtail and curry chicken. Sevice could be a lot more personal and friendlier, lots of room for improvement here."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and was disappointed every time. Food is expensive for what you get and for the quality too.

Will not come here anymore."}
{"text":"It is a fairly small place. The man behind the cash register was friendly. I got the jerk chicken and rice and it was delicious. The interior is clean although uninspired."}
{"text":"I went to this location for lunch at around 11:45. The service was mediocre. The girl was nice enough and took my order politely, though she was also having a conversation with another customer and checking out the television as she was ringing my order in. The food was probably the worst I've ever had at a sunrise restaurant. My barbecue chicken was disappointing. Two pieces were stale and covered in was too much thick, sickeningly sweet sauce...while the other seemed to have been a fresh piece of chicken. The rice was soggy and the oxtail gravy was gelatinous. I had to scrape the sauce off the one decent piece of chicken to at least have something in my stomach.  I threw out 90% of my meal. The one thing that I can say was on point, was the cleanliness of the store. One of the ladies did seem quite frazzled about some sort of tech problem, so I'm hoping it was the time of day coupled with frustration. I will try them again one day in the future at dinner maybe...then edit this review. So disappointed *sigh*"}
