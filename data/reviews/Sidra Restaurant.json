{"text":"Today I ordered a Fattoush Salad and 2 Kebbeh for lunch. The food was very disappointing. The Fattoush salad did not have the traditional sumac, dressing and the Kebbeh was dry and tough to eat. Cost me $10.16 to end up in the trash."}
{"text":"Great food and they make a really excellent shawarma wrap. One of my go to places for shawarmas in Oakville.  You won't be disappointed when you go."}
{"text":"Under new management, awesome food and a welcoming, homey atmosphere. Thanks Chef Nash! We'll be back. P.S. Try the fattoush salad with chicken on top. So delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is amazing and the chef takes pride in making the highest quality with the best ingredients.  Don't see something on the menu, ask and the Chef will do his best to accommodate you.  If you live Mediterranean food, Sidra can't be beat..."}
{"text":"First time here and left us impressed. Great customer service, big portions and really good taste. Ordered the basmati rice with chicken and salad bowl with chicken."}
{"text":"The best shawarma wrap I have had for a while. The place is small but clean as a whistle.  The people are courteous and very pleasant."}
{"text":"There is a few reasons why this place gets 1 star.   First off, wanted to try a mix shwarma plate and it wasn't on menu (chicken or beef at $11.99) she said she can do mixed for $15.99. (extra $4 WTF) So had the chicken shwarma plate. Was not impressed, the salad is shredded lettuce, onion, 3 slices of tomato and black olives with some tasteless dressing. The rice sitting in a metal container was cold. (this was at 1130am) and also the chicken not off the spit, sitting in a metal container cold and dry. The garlic sauce didn't even taste like garlic and hot sauce wasn't spicy at all.   On top of the poor food. The guy preparing my plate was on his phone while making it.   So many other shwarma options in the area. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I've been a regular here for a couple years. It has been consistent at 2.5 out of 5 but I knew what I was getting and it was convenient. Tonight I met the new owner, Nash,  tried his new menu. The Shawarma is now larger with much more meat and the flavor is amazing. Nash has a homemade sauce called Samurai... TRY IT!!!  So good! Also had the fries, Nash adds a nice seasoning to the fries now which make them much much more than just filler now.  Shawarma and fries $10  Keep it up Nash, you can't loose with great food at a great price"}
