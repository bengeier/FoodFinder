{"text":"I've only ordered there twice, but both experiences have surpassed my expectations. Trevi is quickly becoming my go-to pizza delivery place. The pizza dough is perfect, the toppings are delicious, and there is absolutely no lack of cheese. Great quality/price ratio, and I will order there again."}
{"text":"Là j'aime a pizza, très bonne. La pâte est très bonne. Livraison rapide."}
{"text":"Bought two lasagnas today to eat at home and they are just delicious! For two extra dollars you can upgrade your order for a larger portion, and boy, they are good! Staff is friendly, parking on the street is a breeze and the price is really good! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Incredible and fresh pizza. Tastes completely authentic like real Italian. I would go back over and over again. I'm a huge fan of garlic and the sauce is super garlicky and has a special zing to it (vampires beware!). The dough is crunchy but soft."}
{"text":"EDIT: Okay, they're open again. Delivery guy said they all went on holiday that time. Still, it'd be nice to set up an answering machine that just says so, or at least put it on their website or Facebook page.

It's expensive for pizza but it's very good, very filling pizza. Not your typical Montreal pizza. Would recommend.

(Previous review)
The pizza is fantastic, but we tried to order from there again last weekend and the phone just rang and rang (this was in the early evening, on a Saturday night). No answering machine to say they were closed, nothing on their website or Facebook page. Who just closes up like that in the middle of summer without *any* notice on any medium of communication? Is that any way to run a business?

I'll probably order from here again when and if they reopen, because the pizza really was that good, but I'm pretty put off by this."}
