{"text":"Got the Ahi tuna bowl - the ingredients were fresh, colorful, & delicious!  Perfect for anyone who's sensitive to spicy foods (like me).  Every member of the staff was friendly & extremely helpful.  10/10 would eat there again!"}
{"text":"Great customer service with even better food! Super fresh & great tasting! My new fav seafood spot"}
{"text":"I am In love with this restaurant. Food is fresh and so delicious. I've had different bowls and love them all. Oysters are fresh and tasty. The poke Nachos are a must have. All the food is AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"I got a dozen oysters, three different types (which were all excellent). They were served with a horseradish sorbet, something I've never seen before and it was amazing. I also got a Spicy Tuna bowl that was delicious. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good poke and decent price! Well worth the walk from my hotel. Try the spicy ahi poke bowl paired with a Blue Blaze Brewing CO Kolsch, a great combo :-)"}
{"text":"I tried it today for the first time. I had pretty high hopes for this restaurant. The flavors at this restaurant were different from the other places around. The positive of the restaurant was that it had unlimited toppings. Once we chose a protein however it was very little maybe five pieces  in a regular. We ordered oysters and the seaweed salad. The seaweed salad originally looks different. It has more of a Hawaiian theme. We took a few bites and it was delicious and then we found a piece of hair in the seaweed salad."}
{"text":"I had a lobster roll to go.  It was a very small portion of lobster and was not mixed with the other ingredients. The roll itself was small and didn't seem to have been buttered or heated. The container was filled with lots of potato chips to make up for small lobster roll.
The price was extremely high for the portion size.
If I go again I would try something else."}
{"text":"For this to be a raw bar it takes them forever to get your food! I have here for 45 minutes and I still haven't received my food"}
{"text":"Not sure how to pronounce \"Poke\" - but heard
It was a thing so my wife and I came here for lunch today. The Poke bowls were great, I had the Spicy Ahi Tuna and my wife had the Salmon. You know how you can taste if the fish was fresh... it was fresh. Actually all the ingredients were fresh and in good combinations. We ordered the regular vs the large bowls and that was plenty of food. Cool space, clean vibe with good sized community table and places to have one on one conversations. I'm giving it a 4 star instead of 5 because of the price of the beer. Cans are in a cooler next to the cash register and we grabbed two local / non-seasonal / did I mention local /beers. No listed prices anywhere we could see and paid $7.00 and $7.50 for two local beer cans. I expect that pricing at a concert or sporting event, not for a quick lunch.  We will be back, and will order waters - unless they allow BYOB."}
{"text":"yuck. portions are tiny and food is not fresh.  this place is overpriced as hell and simply do not know how to make poke. if you call putting together some mushy rice and unfresh fish a poke bowl then i guess anyone can make it at home. do not recommend, would not come back."}
{"text":"Get the tuna nachos. Just get them. The manager gave us a great wine suggestion, our waiter Jex was nice, funny and also gave us a great food suggestion.

But seriously get the tuna nachos."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  

Food: Flavors are extreme- seaweed salad was so salty and they re- dished it but still quite salty...we asked what it was dressed in thinking maybe overuse of aminos but our server was unsure.   Ate the 5 small pieces of hamachi that came with my small yuzu hamachi bowl and the spiraled cucumbers and long strips of carrots and left the rest because it was so acidic.  I LOVE acidic foods (hence why I ordered yuzu) but balance is needed in this dish. My partner ordered sliders (which didn't come on Hawaiian rolls as stated on menu) and the rainbow bowl and agreed that we will give them some time to work it out before maybe trying it again. (He was a little stuck on being served canned oranges though so not sure how soon that will be)

Service: Good. Our server seemed to be the only one so refills on water took a bit which is understandable but she was quick to try to help rectify the salad being overly salty and removed from check.

Ambiance: cute place but staff yelling across restaurant about the corn being cooked wrong then cleaning grill an hour before closing left a poor impression.  

In short, I am waiting on my room service now."}
{"text":"fuhhinally tried HI Tide Poke & Raw Bar last night and I was not disappointed.

I ordered...insert Justin's eyeroll...a custom bowl (because I always DIY if it's an option, okay? and I know it might seem like *excessive* when I rattle off 15 ingredients whenever we go somewhere that is an option, but it just makes my meals THAT much more enjoyable and interesting. It's like I'm cooking for myself except not really)

I digress. I added, said, 8 or so ingredients (which, by the way, is about the SAME as if I had ordered an \"off-menu bowl). Sorry, I digress again.

Ahi tuna was yummy, I didn't feel like it was fishy at all. They did forget the pickled onions, but I didn't ask for them so I can't ding a star.

Justin had some other type of bowl with rice in it (I opted for quinoa).

I wish there was a note on the menu that said quinoa contained nuts. I am assuming it was the quinoa. I do not have a death-allergy to nuts but I try to avoid and I was surprised they somehow ended up in my bowl.

Staff was all-hands and super friendly.

For a quick meal that won't bog you down, we'll probably be back again.

Their fish and beef prices were pretty solid, too, so I am glad I can finally get my hands on some more Faroe Island Salmon! Oh, and maybe some Waygu..."}
{"text":"Excellent quality fish, wonderful staff and lovely drink selection. It was small inside and we were a big group- but it worked out well on a Thursday and we never felt rushed or crowded and we were there for a while. Half price oysters were also excellent.
Poke bowls are small- even the large so it's worth it to pay the extra few dollars for more.  Thank you to the establishment we enjoyed our experience."}
{"text":"Great suggestion by my colleague! I wasn't sure what to order, so I checked Yelp for an idea! The majority of people raved about the nachos...so that's what I ordered. Was I pleased, YES!! The bowl contained: fried wontons, Ahi tuna, avocado, scallions, cucumber, seaweed salad, tomato, pickled red onion, togarashi & unagi sauce.  I only wish I had a more tuna to match the proportion of wonton chips and sauce. It was very filling.  My friend ordered the poke rainbow, which I will try on another visit. All in all, this is a delightful restaurant with a variety of beers and beverages to sate any palate."}
{"text":"Fresh, quick, good sauces. Fish was fresh, topping choices were fun. Especially helpful to our son with some allergy needs. Putting their right foot in at the hoke poke."}
{"text":"The oysters are always fresh and taste great.  I love the horseradish ice that they provide.  I ordered the spicy tuna bowl but asked to sub for coconut rice.  When the order came it was there regular rice.  The rice was cold and hard to eat.  It didn't break up easily.  Overall it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Great overall. The poke nachos were the highlight of the meal. It was a generous serving with lots of goodies. There is a bunch of different sauces you can add to personalize your bowl. Service was great and the food came out very quickly (I know it is raw, but sometimes you think that it would come out quickly but it doesn't). Definitely worth a try 

PS There is wine and beer available."}
{"text":"Went there with my daughter for lunch today. The food was great. I had the lobster roll and it was fantastic. My daughter had a poke bowl which she loved. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"What an awesome experience and excellent food. Enjoyed the chef selection of oysters along with the rainbow poke bowl and beer!  Give it a try and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! I've been here twice now and both times have created my own masterpiece with the make your own poke bowl. You can choose from four different bases (I always go for the milky Queen rice, six different proteins (I've tried the tuna and salmon), and then unlimited, yes UNLIMITED fruit and veggies (such as avocado, mango, cucumber, etc.), crunchy & contrast toppings (e.g. wasabi peas, fresh ginger, toasted coconut, etc.) and herbs, spices and sauces. My bowl looks like a beautiful rainbow of deliciousness. Hi Tide Poke only uses fresh seafood from environmental friendly and sustainable sources, which is very important to me."}
{"text":"Service was very fast and very friendly. I think I just don't like poke...I was expecting it to be warm for some reason. But it was cold, tasted very fishy (like it's supposed to, just not for me) and I personally didn't like the flavor combination of coconut rice and pinapple with the seaflood flavor. If I go back, I will definitely try something different on the menu, probably salad."}
{"text":"It breaks my heart to review one of my once favorite places with a low star review. I am just extremely disappointed with the service and food quality the last few times I have visited HiTide. 

I order takeout pretty often and I feel that I always get a smaller portion, items are often forgotten on my build your own bowls and just not as much love given to my dish. 

This week we decided to go sit down and see if the quality of the food was better. My fiancé just had knee surgery so he is on crutches, when we arrived the place was VERY busy. (Side note: it doesn't take much for it to be very busy because the place is way too small) Either way I came in to hunt for a low chair for my fiancé because he can't sit at the high tops or stand for long. I saw a table in the far corner that only had one chair and wasn't being used. My fiancé sat down and we were approached by a server and told they were on a wait. I explain my fiancé's knee, we weren't trying to cut the line but it was obvious that this table wasn't being used since they didn't have enough chairs to go around. We were treated quiet rudely. No one every returned to our table to put us on the wait, I approached the counter and said we can just place a togo order since my fiancé can't stand and y'all are on a wait. I was told no it's ok y'all sit there and we will be with you shortly. 

Eventually our sever came over. He seemed flustered by the \"lobster roll special\" rush. We explained that we would do oysters to start, they were out of several on the board but we order 2 of each for a sampler. My server told us \"we really needed to go ahead and put our food in because it will take awhile\". We ordered our poke bowls as well and then next thing you know our bowls are on the table without or oyster app. I asked if he had forgotten to ring it in and they said oysters take a long time to prepare. (Mhm really? Shucking 8 oysters doesn't take long but ok) My fiancés bowl was wrong, it was suppose to be half portions of two fishes and it wasn't plus a few ingredients left off. Then a few minutes later we were basically done with our dinner and the app of oysters shows up. The, what I believe was the manager, sat them down and walked off. She didn't tell me which oysters were which or tell me about the sauces or anything. Eventually our server comes back and we ask him. He didn't know either and had to go ask. Then I said \"I don't see any horseradish, May I please have some?\" The server points at a ramekin of ice \"it's right there\" like I am stupid or something. Apparently it was horseradish ice but how was I to know that??? Overall it was an awful experience and my fiancé has sworn that we won't \"waste our money here again\". 

I personally haven't sworn it off completely but I think they are really losing the spark they had upon opening! Poke places are opening all over these days... the competition's hot on their tails!"}
{"text":"I came for their $15 lobster rolls (plus chips or fries) on Monday. 

Off to great start when I ordered my to go order at the register. I was given an infused water to sip on while I waited. And waited and waited. Call ahead for your order as I waited 30 min for two lobster rolls and fries. 

That said, can't wait to come back to grab sushi grade fish to go or enjoy their wide selection of oysters. 

The lobster rolls were stuffed full of sweet meat. The fries weren't special but the lobster more than made up for that."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a late lunch today and this place was great! My wife and I got two regular size bowls with the Poke Nachos as well and it was more than plenty. The flavor in the Poke Nachos was fantastic! I highly recommend those. We'll be coming back more often for sure."}
{"text":"Ugh! Didn't want to write this one but decided I should. I so want this place to be successful that I think it is important to remind them to focus. I went to the restaurant this week to purchase takeout for a lunch meeting. To say I have been DYING to try it is an understatement. First, I can walk to it. Second, I love sushi and poke bowls. Third, tons of my friends had posted the most beautiful Insta posts and positive comments. 

The place the gorgeous. The staff is so enthusiastic. But not through or detailed oriented enough. I wasn't given a \"place card\" when I ordered but didn't realize I needed it. Multiple times staff came over to ask me if I had a question and was ready to order and I told them I had already ordered. They brought me my to go bag and I grabbed some chopsticks and left. After I got back to my home office and was preparing for a meeting I found that they did not include one of the items we ordered. When I call back, The first thing they said is oh you forgot your nachos. I didn't forget it they didn't give them to me. Sorry, I'm just a pet peeve about the customer is always right and you should never say anything to make them feel like they are wrong. Especially when they are not wrong. Theyvasked if I could come back which wasn't possible so then they said they would talk to their manager and I would have a credit next time I came. I will update this review based on the next time I come and if that works out.

After getting off the phone with them, I opened my bowl and started to eat. That's when I realize that they completely ignored the instructions that I gave them and I saw on the computer screen. No Mandarin oranges no red cabbage. See this bowl, they didn't listen. Even though it was clearly printed on the screen that I saw when I ordered.

The reason it is 3 Stars and Not 2 is because the food was great. But they got two strikes on a to go order. You cannot fix that customer experience after they walk out of the door so you have to guarantee the orders are accurate. FYI - I went early so it wasn't super slammed.

I will definitely try again but hope this review makes everyone double triple check their to go bags before leaving"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed the ahi tuna bowl. Fresh fish and vegetables. Will definitely be back for this. The lobster roll is small, too small for $22.50. Would have rather had a larger roll and paid $28.00. That being said the roll wasn't tail. It was packed with succulent knuckle and was tasty. But, I have had better, thus the 4 stars. Also, those that are saying the portions are small for the bowls, I don't agree. 8.50 is reasonably priced! Considering Charlotte is very behind every other decent city when it comes to a variety of food, I will be back!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and had a poke rainbow bowl, it was really good and probably the best poke in Charlotte. The service was great! I asked the manager if their was anyway I could get a flank steak cooked to go for dinner and she made it happen! She was very helpful and went above and beyond for me. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We had a problem with an online order so we called and the manager was very nice and told us to come in the following week for complimentary poke bowls. We went in on Thursday night and the staff was kind and helpful. The manager that night looked into it and made sure our experience was good throughout. We ordered half a dozen Fire Lake oysters ($15 @ 2.50 each) and they were delicious and well-cleaned. 

The rainbow poke bowl is really awesome. It has salmon, ahi tuna and hamachi which makes a great sampling of the popular fish varieties without the added expense of $5 per additional protein if you go with other bowls. It's a great option if you can't decide what you want! 

We had Anika (sorry if I'm spelling your name wrong!) as a server and she was lovely. She added in a few toppings I was craving into the bowl. 

Slip ups happen at all restaurants and Hi Tide made up for it and we will continue to visit! This was our fifth time dining here/doing take out in a month so it tell you they are doing something right!"}
{"text":"Loved my poke rainbow bowl,  just with a few tweeks. I got it with no cabbage or cucumbers but added wasabi peas, edamame, pepper flakes & cilantro. I highly recommend their creamy sauce, taste like a lighter spicy mayo. All of the other sauces were much more of a thinner liquid & clear ish. Their super kind worker let me try a good portion of their options, which I didn't expect at all but I'm glad bc I don't think the others were my type, but they were interesting. I'm sure the plus is that It is healthier. 
The bd tried the lobster roll which he said must be their huge seller bc 4 out of 5 people ordered it when he kindly glanced at other guests plates. It was tasty, semi sweet & he absolutely loved it. It was on the small side for him (if he was starving) but the plus is they give you great quality portion, big meat but smaller bread. It's a good thing he had breakfast. 
Their strawberry cooler I liked better than the peach tea. Strawberry had more flavor and the peach tea was more of a light refreshing taste but I still liked both. Big plus for having infused water and I like their ice! Not cubed, not slush, but good. And I adore the fish lines they painted in the parking lot instead of the regular straight line, never seen that anywhere else! Would love to come back for the oysters, we thought it was a good price."}
{"text":"I had the classic poke. It's a smaller size with clean flavors that work nicely together."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my poke bowl from here. I got tuna with the sesame soy sauce. I like that the toppings are unlimited. It is also nice to get a side of shucked oysters with your poke. I found it to be better than other poke joints in Charlotte. I will be back."}
{"text":"I'm so excited this place exists!! I love fresh ingredients and fresh flavors. Suggested combos looked great, but I decided to make my own. Was very happy with the fish portion I got. Waiter was super nice and helpful. Beer and wine selection is decent. Can't wait to go again soon and try all their combos!"}
{"text":"I tried this place again after hearing positive reviews. My opinion is precisely the same now as it was on my prior visit. Here is my prior review:

Love the concept, love the place, wanted to love the food.  But...  I didn't.  Fish was fishy. They need to bump the quality up. The prices could be bumped to account for the quality improvement and still remain affordable. Small poke bowls are $8.95 and large ones are $11.95. When you consider the prices it remains a great value. 

The Ahi Poke Nacho appetizer was good but the ratio of chips was too great for the tasty toppings.  Perhaps serve it in a shallower dish and get the ratio better so I don't have nicely topped chips on top and a bunch of dry ones below?

Nice  that they provide various sauces at the table. Love the beautiful wooden communal table. 

As a long-time Charlottean I instantly recognized and felt immense nastalgia for the Fresh Fish sign from Butler Seafood, which occupie this space for many years. In a city that rarely celebrates its historic elements I was extremely pleased to see this sign prominently displayed inside!"}
{"text":"WARNING: if you must have poke, I strongly suggest going to Seoul Poke Bowl or even driving a little further out to the new Umami Pokerito in Pineville (which btw is amazing). This place is seriously so bad I wish I could give it 0 stars! 

If you feel like paying $14 for a tiny ass bowl of mushy gross rice and mediocre fish (see my pics), then this is the place for you! 

I weigh just over 100 lbs and I ordered the \"large\" poke bowl. I left the restaurant feeling like I didn't eat at all. We also ordered the poke nachos or whatever. If you want heart or kidney failure from sodium overdose, then this is the dish for you! The chips were SO salty and over seasoned with sauce that you can barely taste the fish. It felt so unhealthy. It's probably because they want to cover smell of the fish thats not fresh? Idk but it was so bad that I had to tell one of the waiters that it is too salty. He took it back and brought out another one that was the EXACT same thing that we just had. WTF? 

Anyways the conclusion is that this place is pretty damn terrible lol. Maybe they think most people that come here don't know the concept of Poke and therefore will be fooled into buying their vastly overpriced disgusting tasting food?? who knows. I've been to places in Manhattan that give you way more food that's more fresh and cheaper!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the portions were nice and hearty. Lots of options for making your own poke bowl which I love. Poke worth trying!!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute! I love the atmosphere, the food is really good. I got the ahi tuna nachos and it was so flavorful, the price point was amazing, and you got a lot of food. Very filling. The customer service is really nice too. I love the open raw bar they have, it's a great lunch spot for sure"}
{"text":"We were excited to hear of a Poke Bowl restaurant opening. Our experience was less than exciting. I ordered the Spicy Ahi and my husband had the Chile Yuzu Hamachi bowl. I received just the regular Ahi bowl that was bland and missing 2 ingredients, but fortunately they include extra bottles of sauces at the table. Unfortunately the sauces lacked flavor. My husband's bowl was missing 3 of the key ingredients including the sauce so he needed to add sauce at the table as well. His Hamachi was also still partially frozen.

It was very busy as it was lunch time on a Saturday, however the servers were not attentive: we were not asked how our meal was, tables were not cleared while new customers wandered around looking for seats; all the while the server stood at the counter folding napkins with her back to the restaurant. 

The music was also very loud and we were unable to talk except between songs."}
{"text":"Upon arrival, I was greeted promptly by a friendly server who offered me a menu. As I browsed the menu, I ordered  the Riesling which tasted lovely! I started with the shrimp cocktail, followed by the lobster roll. Both choices were fresh and delicious!!! The staff was very friendly and the restaurant was impeccably clean! I will definitely be going back for more!!!!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here on the opening day. We ordered spicy tuna bowls. Hers was on rice and mine was on soba noodle. Both were delicious. It took a while for us to get our order but it is understandable since it was their first day. The only flaw I saw was the toppings in the two bowls were slightly different and mine didn't have the spicy sauce.

The staffs were super super friendly. They let us take time to order and always walked by to check if we need anything. I got their peach green tea which was really good. They packed another cup for me to go when we finished our meal. 

We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We created our own poke bowls, one large and one regular and both were hearty portions and tasted great. We got the poke nachos on a whim and they ended up possibly being the best part of the meal!"}
{"text":"I have pulled in to Hi Tide, now twice, on my commute home from work. First time, dining in. I was dying to try some 1/2 priced oysters, which they offer daily, Monday -Thursday. I had a great experience. I'll definitely go back for more. Today, I stopped for take out, and had to try my first POKE bowl. I tried the Sriracha Salmon, medium. Incredible!!!
I'm hooked. I'm a pescatarian and also eating low carb, so Hi Tide is my new jam.
Can't wait to try lobster roll, on a bed of greens for me, on special every Monday. They also offer an incredible selection to whet your whistle."}
{"text":"It was good. I had the rainbow bowl. Each bowl comes in 2 sizes. If you are hungry at all, order the large. Portion sizes overall are pretty small. I ordered takeout for my boyfriend and I. He had the Ahi Tuna Bowl and said it was good. The drawbacks to this place are the atmosphere and the price. It's trendy so we expected it to be more expensive than it should be, so that wasn't a surprise. The atmosphere wasn't my style. Pretty cold, but I didn't eat there so I don't want to judge something I didn't experience. It's definitely worth a try but I'm not sure we will be back."}
{"text":"The poke nachos was delicious and a very big portion for the price.  Parking was a pain!  We were ordering to go and there was absolutely nowhere to stand not a designated section for people to wait for their to go orders.  Price is super reasonable for poke.  Will definitely come back aside from the parking."}
{"text":"Pros- spicy tuna bowl was really good. We loved the rice and overall combination of flavors. 

Peach tea was good and crushed ice always rocks.

Menu is interesting - lots of combo bowls. 

Lobster roll was tasty. But:

Cons- it was the tiniest lobster roll I've ever seen!
It was on a little Hawaiian bun rather than the larger, longer tradional toasted roll. We spit both things and half the roll took 3 bites to finish. It was not priced like a single slider... $22! I recommend Dean and Deluca(3 sliders for same price)  or the place near Talbots/ Southpark(based in Florida). They used to have delicious lobster rolls on Fridays. 

It came with  a large portion of fries but they were not hot and they lacked flavor. 

There were a lot of employees and everyone was pleasant but there seemed to be a lack of focus on helping customers at the counter. You have to order and pay at counter first and food is brought to table.  (Pet peeve- paying same or more for food at places that don't offer full service.) This was lunch but they do have full service at dinner.

No regular brewed tea.

We plan to back one weeknight for half-price oysters. The variety looked really good. I'd like to try the poke nachos too. 

I'll keep my eyes out for lobster roll improvement!!"}
{"text":"I am in LOVE with this place! We came here around 7 on a Saturday night, and there was no wait. The set up and ambiance was awesome; the best way I can describe this is laid back casual. The vibe is a true New England fish market, but a modern no-frills hip take on it.

We ordered the Poke Nachos, Lobster roll, Spicy Ahi Tuna Bowl, and the Seared Wagyu Bowl. First off, the Regular size poke bowl is a great size. For 8.95, the regular size is plenty to feed one person.  They also offer a large for $12.95 (which is prob what a large dude would eat if they were trying to pack the protein in.  

The nachos were unexpectedly tasty! They're served on fried wonton crisps, and that is the perfect choice. You can tell the dish is really balanced, and that a lot of thought went into the elements.  The seaweed isn't your normal seaweed, and is a perfect touch. The creamy and spicy togarashi sauce ties the whole thing together without overpowering the tuna, and leaves you wanting more!

Bowl of our bowls were really really good, and I especially like how they have a sauce and accoutrements station at the tables; you can spice, sauce, and season the bowl to your liking! And for FREE. The soy reduction and lime ponzu were our personal faves, but they were all good.

Last, but not least, the lobster roll. OHHHH, the lobster roll. A moment of awed silence for this.
I'm from Connecticut. The COAST of Connecticut. So when I tell you I've had more lobster rolls in my life than most people have had glasses of water, I'm not kidding. So believe me when I say, this is the BEST cold lobster roll that I've ever had.  { Only second to a hot lobster roll that I had in Maine, because... butter. ?}
The lobster they use isn't over cooked or over-steamed, which happens a lot unfortunately. Their lobster is clearly great quality and properly prepared. And there's SO much of it!! It's a huge portion for only ~$20. Best part: it's not oversoaked in mayo or huge chunks of celery...it's light and fresh. Served on what is obviously a toasted Martins Potato roll (true connoisseurs choice for lobster roll), this is just perfection.

This new spot is no amateur hour, and is the product of what is obviously a lot of careful and deliberate planning from its owners.  Check it out ASAP, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"First time trying this cuisine although I did not get a poke bowl. I tried the nachos and the sliders. The nachos need more sauce and toppings, but they were delicious. The sliders were wonderful with a perfect balance of toppings. I would definitely return and next time I will try a bowl."}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB. Boyfriend lives across the street and if I wasn't obsessed with him already, I'd probably still stick around just so we could continue hitting up this joint every weekend.

Everything is so fresh, flavorful, and delicious. I can't move past the signature shrimp bowl, but I have ventured out to try the waygu steak bowl as well as the wonton nachos. Nachos are probably/definitely not gluten free and man, did I regret it later; however, THEY WERE SO GOOD, I can't promise that I'll never order and suffer again.

The shrimp bowl is like heaven in a dish. Yummy, fresh shrimp, surrounded by pineapple and spices and vegetables, and I smother the whole thing in their Kuzu Lime sauce and I just really can't imagine myself happier than I am when I'm eating that thing. 

I tried the waygu steak bowl - the steak was a little rare for my taste and the wasabi peas were a little spicy for my taste (I know, I'm a child, shut up). It was still great and it's my boyfriend's go-to bowl.

The nachos are otherworldly - wonton strips and delicious chunks of seafood and vegetables and it's all covered in this obscenely delicious creamy sauce that would make an old shoe taste good. Seriously. Get the freaking nachos.

Service is awesome - they've made fun of the boyfriend and I for literally coming in for 3 days in a row before. Stop making the food so damn good if you don't want to see our faces!"}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed with not only the service here, but the available items to choose from.

If you aren't into raw fish it's still a great salad place.  They also have oysters.  

The pricing is decent.  A small bowl is plenty for one person ($10-11).  They have a menu but you can build your own bowl as well.  Everything looked and treated super fresh.

The interior is that rustic industrial that's so popular now but works well with this concept.  Plenty of seating inside and they are working on expanding their patio and getting it covered.  

I'm glad I tried it and the location is central to Uptown, Myers Park and is right next to Dilworth Neighborhood Grill.  

I'll eat there again."}
{"text":"Really really good poke bowl! Fresh and great quality. I got the Rainbow bowl and highly recommend. My only critique is it could have used a little bit of sauce in it, but I'm not going to knock off a star because I always have a lot of sauce on my food and I don't know that it's \"traditional\" of poke to be covered in sauce. Just my preference (: 

Definitely a place you need to try!!"}
{"text":"This place is... passable. I came here bc I had poke at Pei Wei and loved it. I got the Rainbow Bowl, and my husband got the Shrimp Roll. The shrimp roll was tiny, but fairly tasty. The fries were good. The Rainbow Bowl was just ok. I personally like Pei Wei better."}
{"text":"Pretty good poke, but they need to have aioli on the table as well. Shrimp roll was not good."}
{"text":"Came in late on a Saturday night and it was almost closing but the service was still on par. She was very accommodating to our shellfish, nut, and soy allergy at the table, so we knew which bowls and sauces not to use. I got the poke rainbow bowl which appeared to be a great way to taste the main fishes plus many of my favorite toppings. I enjoyed everything except for the milky rice. Don't get me wrong, I love sticky rice, congee and all but didn't care for the taste/texture of the milky rice base. Next time I'll definitely go for a substitute grain or just build my own bowl. 

The atmosphere was chill and I liked the decor. Not sure how it gets when it's super busy but I'm willing to go again."}
{"text":"If you want a cool place with more than just Poke, look no further than Hi-Tide.  The oysters are amazing, and the Poke Nachos are the best nachos that I have had any place in country.  Love the community tables, so you get the atmosphere of being in one of the big cities in the U.S.A.  They have made it easy to enjoy a healthy meal."}
{"text":"A poke invasion has finally swept through Charlotte. I'm not mad about it. 

Located next to Dilworth Neighborhood Grill, this spot serves up fresh poke bowls, oysters, and seafood rolls. There are 10 Hi Tide Signature Bowls (Regular: $8.95, Large: $12.95) to choose from and you can add toppings to those. There's also the option to build your own bowl with a laundry list of bases, proteins, toppings, sauces, etc. There are sauces on the table as well. If I'm getting a lobster roll, I'm dipping my fries in the sweet soy reduction. I also throw some sriracha in my ketchup.

Specials alert: all day long on Monday's: lobster roll with your choice of seasoned chips or fries $15.99. Big savings, they are usually around $23 (market price). Monday-Friday they do oyster happy hour from 4-7pm. 1/2 off fresh oysters. Note: regular price of their cheapest oyster is usually $3. I still say the steal of the menu is the Poke Nachos ($8.95). Delicious, big portion, and the unagi saucy is tasty. 

They always offer free cucumber & mint water. They also have fresh daily made frescas and a delicious cold brewed Hawaiian Coffee with coconut cream. There's also a cooler with wine, champs, and beer options. 

A heads up: the parking lot is kind of on the small size, you may have trouble finding a spot during peak lunch time.

The Stars are Just Like Us: Coach Ron Rivera sat at the table next to me during a trip here, so if anyone asks I technically had lunch with Riverboat."}
{"text":"After visiting Hi Tide, I'm still on the search for great raw fish in Charlotte. It satisfied my craving for seafood, but did not leave me wanting more.

I tried their rainbow poke bowl, and the fish was a little too warm for my liking. It was filling, but it just didn't impress me much. The Goose, of course, ordered the steak bowl and felt similarly about it."}
{"text":"I ate here once and the food was pretty good for poke in Charlotte. Unfortunately I have since ordered twice from here and the service is deplorable and the staff is borderline rude. Will never order here again"}
{"text":"Amazing fresh fish, the nachos are definitely worth getting. The Hawaiian cold brew coconut cream is also great too!"}
{"text":"We had an excellent meal at HI Tide. Recently opened and it looks great inside and out. The food was great, I had the Poke nachos and a lobster roll. Everything was seasoned perfectly and tasted great. I plan on making this a regular stop in Charlotte. The service was great as well."}
{"text":"HI Tide is a fun new spot near Dilworth with good food. The atmosphere is reasonable but could be more intimate considering it is a sushi/poke restaurant which is usually associated with luxury meals. Their make your own poke bowl is very well priced and I enjoyed being able to choose what I wanted in my \"nacho poke bowl.\" The sauces were disappointing and I do wish they would have had a better creamy sauce option for the dish. Their sliders were delicious. I really enjoyed the wagu beef slider but was disappointed by the fried oyster slider. For $4 it should have had a minimum of 2 oysters for the size of the bun. I will definitely be trying HI Tide again."}
{"text":"Fabulous restaurant. I had the shrimp roll and a beef slider from my associates plate.  Absolutely perfect.  The shrimp was not overdressed in too much mayo and spices.  The bread was lightly toasted with a bit of butter so it was not greasy. Crunchy veggies on both that made it extra tasty.  Fresh is the word to describe this meal.  Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"Man... I really want to love this place but they make it difficult. I've had two orders messed up. The first time I ordered take out my order included the sliders. To my own fault, I should've checked the box prior to leaving the restaurant. I don't eat beef but for some reason I had Multiple beef sliders when it was suppose to be oysters. 

Today when I ordered again through Grubhub I created a \"build your bowl\" I was craving one after my rather daunting Friday meeting. I paid for a large but received a small. Additionally, over half of the items I requested to be in my bowl were missing. Sigh. So, needless to say my lunch was just Blah. 

The quality of fresh ingredients is good, don't get me wrong but quality control on to go orders is an area that needs some attention. :( 

Maybe, 3rd times a charm...."}
{"text":"Great Fresh Flavors!!!! Amazing staff great prices.  A lot of work goes into the prep and you can taste it.  Authentic Asian ingredients and fresh fish make this place awesome. 

I dropped one star cause the ambiance is a little off.  Many of the Poke bars I've been too are similar to the Chipotle method of Orderring.  This place chooses to use a menu.  They are also mixed with a seafood store/aged meat seller. It all seams like a weird mix.  Plus the music seams loud. 


Overall a great meal and a unique consent for the Queen City.   I wish them the best going forward.   Check this place out!"}
{"text":"We rolled in on a Monday, excited to try the Lobster Roll special. Neither my husband or I had eaten a lobster roll before (I know, crazy) and I had heard that theirs were tasty (small, but tasty). We started with the Poke Nachos and I llllllooooooovvvvvveeeeddddd them! They were so good! A lot of times, dishes like this have few toppings and by the time you get half way through, there are just plain chips left. Not these! Even at the bottom, the wontons had some toppings on them. So tasty!

On this particular day, I was feeling crazy and decided to try my first raw oyster. My husband loves them so he ordered a few. I tried one (didn't die but I am not a fan). My husband loved them and said he would definitely get them again.

Lobster rolls were full of yummy lobster meat. I was expecting more of a sauce but either way, it was tasty! My husband's roll had a few pieces of lobster shell in it that he picked out but mine didn't. Neither of us particularly loved our sides (he got fries, I got chips), but we were so full from the Poke Nachos that it didn't really matter.

We will definitely be back and next time, my husband can keep the raw oysters for himself!"}
{"text":"I honestly did now know you could make lobster as good as Hi Tide has. Simply amazing. Staff was great, the restaurant was extremely clean, warming and I can't wait to go back for oysters on the half shell happy hour. This is my new go to spot in Dilworth. Also the Girl says the shrimp salad is the best thing she has ever eaten."}
{"text":"Newfangled. Mouth-watering. Costly. Chic. 

I've driven by Hi Tide daily on my commute to work. When it opened I doubted it would last. After having a bowl tonight, I can only hope it does. 

I chose to build my own bowl since I have dietary restrictions. As i was going through the list i was surprised by the options and how much I could pack into this vibrant bowl of fresh healthy foods. 

I opted for the large, a $5 up charge, and I'm so glad i did. It was filling, but not too much (especially scone I had mostly fruit and veggies). The crispy tofu was better than most and didn't seem greasy. 

I can't wait to take my husband here for the lobstah (New England way of saying it) roll. He will be wicked happy!

I don't think you could go wrong with the menu options or something you create yourself. 

Next up for me, those nachos!!"}
{"text":"First impression: The place is cute. It looks like a chic fish market with community seating. 

Staff: The women we ordered from had no clue what was going on. There are three drink machines against the back wall and she didn't know what was in them. 

Food: The $21 lobster roll was cold and tiny. The best part was by far the fries. The poke bowl was good but tiny, even though I ordered a small, it was really, really small. We also ordered poke nachos which were basically a big bowl of wonton chips with a few pieces of fish and some seaweed. 

Service: They use a card system which is very inefficient so there was constantly someone asking you if what they were holding was yours. We got our first two things fairly quickly and then had to ask 20 minutes later where our third dish was. 

Overall: We would go back but would definitely get large, overpriced, poke bowls only."}
{"text":"First time poke bowl experience.

Overall I thought it was good, I don't know if I would get it again--but that is simply off of personal preference. I may try to build my own bowl and see if that makes a difference, I just didn't enjoy the seaweed salad in the bowl with some of the other ingredients. In my specific bowl there were too many red onions, and that flavor kind of took over.

The ingredients were fresh. I ordered the Ahi Tuna bowl with coconut rice. Everything tasted good, I was confused on the sauce situation--the bowl definitely needed some type of sauce on it. But the quality of the fish was fantastic and all the veggies etc. were crisp and yummy. I absolutely loved the pickled radish and would return simply to eat more of that. I got the regular and the portion was perfect for lunch. 

I'm interested in other items on the menu such as the lobster roll and raw oysters, I love the concept and the interior is really bright and inviting. I think they will need to figure out additional seating because it's a popular spot with very little room to sit inside--the parking lot is also small FYI. 

Again, overall it was really good. Ingredients were fresh, service was great--I'd like to go back and try some other items!"}
{"text":"Very good oysters and ahi tuna but pretty slow service from the kitchen. Still worth the wait."}
{"text":"I heard about their sale on Lobster Rolls (must have been after all the great news about Cousins Lobster in Charlotte because the price is now slightly less) so my wife and I went in. 
3 tables and rest long high tops which is fine but for such a small restaurant they allowed people waiting on take out orders to sit at the tables. That made no sense at all.
I love Poke and I'm sorry to say that this was not good. I would stay with CO, Poke Cafe, or Cowfish.
The place was pretty but the vibe unfortunately was not good and neither was the food."}
{"text":"We ate at Hi Tide about six weeks ago and had a very good meal. We went back tonight and the food was great! We built a bowl with Ahi Tuna and multiple other ingredients and the tuna was fresh and delicious. The portion was more then adequate. 

Last time we ordered the tuna nachos and really liked it. We decided to order the nachos again and were equally pleased. 

The meal was only $23 not including the beer my girlfriend ordered.

Highly recommended and we won't wait 6 weeks for our next visit!"}
{"text":"This was my second poke experience in Charlotte and it didn't disappoint! 

This is an intimate little casual spot - I almost missed it driving by! I walked in and immediately felt welcomed. Darnell (my server) was very attentive, friendly and was patient with me even though I took forever reviewing the menu, lmao. 

I built my own bowl (salmon, kale salad, carrots, green onions, kimchi, pickled ginger, mango, avocado and red onion) and topped it with the lime sauce and soy reduction. Everything was SO fresh and I almost regret not getting more toppings than I did!

I definitely plan on coming back to try out their other menu items. That lobster roll is calling my name..."}
{"text":"Best thing about this place is the option to build your own. They don't nickel and dime over every ingredient so you can make your perfect bowl and not feel guilty. Doesn't hurt that the sauces are amazing with quality meats."}
