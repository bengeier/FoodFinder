{"text":"I used to make puffy tacos years ago in Albuquerque, NM. I am 63 years old and I haven't had a puffy taco since I was 16 years old. Let me say these were the best tacos I've had ever!  I heard they still make them in southern TX but I was glad to run across them in AZ on a recent trip. I had the carnitas, bean/cheese, shredded beef and my wife had a shredded chicken. They were all delicious. With the AZ heat you will definitely want takeout. But I can imagine later (or earlier) in the year it might be nice to eat at the available tables outside this food truck. Their service is limited (3 or 4 days a week) but well worth the trip. I will come back every trip I make to AZ."}
{"text":"These guys rolled past me on the highway and I took their number down.  They are a food truck if you are wondering, they usually stay around the Surprise area so we decided to hit them up on a whim. We called them and they we by the baseball fields near our house, so we hopped in the truck and went to see them. The menu is pretty basic taco plates with beans and rice, burrito  plates and quesadillas.  Options for carne asada, beef, pork and chicken.  I had the 2 taco plate, it was ok. The tacos were small, smaller than street tacos and the masa wasn't all that puffy. These are quite popular around the San Antonio area where I was introduced to them and these just fell a little flat (No pun intended)."}
{"text":"Drove 20 miles to give them a try during posted open hours but they we not open. A bit disappointed as we have been searching for puffy tacos since moving to the valley. Maybe try another time."}
{"text":"This was my first time having puffy tacos and I loved them!! I had the carne asada which was super moist and had great flavor. The beans were really good, not dry at all. They had actual taste unlike the glue like beans I've had too often. The rice had just the right amount of spice. The plate comes with a container of salsa and guacamole which were both great. There is plenty of parking and there are tables and chairs to enjoy your meal. It's cash only. We will definitely be back to try the other dishes. Glad we stopped by"}
{"text":"Waited 50mins (as well as everyone else) for our food.  Ridiculous considering the amount of people they had in line.  They were deep frying one flip'n puffy taco shell at a time.  So, if you ordered 6 tacos, it was going to be 24mins before they even finished with the shell!  Person in front of me waited 1hr for 4 quesadillas.  Avoid if you have a choice.  Food was bland and crappy service!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy a good taco, Puffy Taco Shack is the freshest street taco food. I had my first taste at spring training 2 seasons ago. A puffy surprise, the owner had the longest lines. Every one walked away with a smile. Follow Puffy Taco on Facebook, and check out the new delights. Street food at its best."}
{"text":"I finally made it to the puffy taco shack.  I grew up in south Texas, love puffy tacos.  These are seriously good, I can't wait to go back!  Bean and cheese as well as the beef were my favorite."}
