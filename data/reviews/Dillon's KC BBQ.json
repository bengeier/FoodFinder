{"text":"Great lunch spot! Their BBQ sandwiches are good but the real cream of the crop is their beans. These are definitely not vegetarian beans. There were thick chunks of meat right in the sauce. Their coleslaw was meh but on balance it made it to five stars."}
{"text":"Good BBQ and decent family atmosphere. The wait gets ridiculous at times and we have had to leave and go somewhere else twice but that normally means the food is just that good so I do recommend. Just try to show up early to beat the crowd."}
{"text":"We had a large party for a friend's birthday.  The shark tank was awesome and very entertaining.   We got there about 5 minutes after they were seated.  We had to wait about 10 minutes before our came back to ask for drink orders.  Then we watched as she went and made 3 rounds to her other tables before we got our drinks.  I had asked specifically if they had Dr . Pepper she said they did.  It was mr.pibb.  I do not like mr.pibb.  There was a picture of the blue cheese burger showing lots of blue cheese.  I ordered that and asked for onion rings instead of fries.   I was told that i might as well order them as an extra side because i would be charged the extra $2 anyway.  So i did.  My burger actually looked better than the picture.  It was delicious.   However my friend ordered chicken fried steak and got a pile of breading and some steak inside of it.  Her mother ordered a baked potato with sour cream, bacon, and onion, and instead got butter and sour cream.  And the kids all got their plates absolutely last so they whined until their food came.  Our server only asked those drinking beer if they wanted refills, the rest of us resigned to being thirsty while she filled salt and pepper shakers at other tables.  She obviously didn't care too much since her gratuity was added automatically."}
{"text":"The food was flavorless and was almost like frozen store bought microwave taste, the restaurant was dirty and the hostess even sat us at a dirty table, we asked to see a manage but one never came although he was up at the hostess stand chatting with girls. The only good this about this trip was the animals you get to look at, next time I will be going to famous Dave's. Not worth the money and not worth the stomach ache you get after."}
{"text":"Ambience is great,  shark tank is awesome,  service is great.  Food is at best do so. 
I wanted to really like this place,  it was cool that it was so close to home,  i doubt we'll be back unfortunately."}
{"text":"Enjoyed very much. Was even able to keep my 2 year old busy. Staff was friendly and flamingos were pretty awesome."}
{"text":"This is actually about the 'new' Dillon's at the Aquarium in Surprise since Dillon's at Grand has closed.   I've never been a fan of Dillon's but we went with friends and I had an open mind, hoping that this experience would be better.  It was not.  The server was most unfriendly although we were seated quickly and our order was taken quickly as well.  My wife asked if a salad was included with the entree and was told we could have one for an additional $1.99.  We each ordered 10oz prime for $20.99...not cheap particularly since salad was not included.  After we had eaten our salads, the dirty dishes remained on the table until I got up and moved them myself to another table.  The meal itself:  no bread was served before the entree...a stale roll was on the entree plate along with a cup of juice, a cup of sour cream for the potato and another cup of whatever.  A pad of butter was buried under the roll.  It was as if we needed to disassemble the plate before we could eat.  The server asked how it was as soon as it arrived..we never saw him again until he asked   about dessert.  The prime itself was dry and tasteless..really awful...the veggie was cold, but the baked potato was excellent.  After we ate, we again had to clear the table ourselves.  When the bill arrived, I  saw the served had charged us $12.00 for the two house salads which he said were $1.99 each.  I complained that we relied on what he told us and he took $8.00 off our check.  In summary:  service was awful, the meal was awful and we won't be back.  BTW: I wish Dillon's could at least make the food more attractive and provide decent bread before the entree."}
{"text":"Great food at this place.  Went there last night.  Although crowded, wait staff was very pleasant and the pulled pork platter was great.  Will go there many times in the future."}
{"text":"Been in the food industry for 20 years. My dad 50. Dont waste your time or money at this location. infant daughter was asleep in stroller so we were forced to the patio. No big deal... we were the ONLY ones there to eat. Took a while for someone to come out of the back to seat us though. Sat on patio for 23 minutes... never were talked to by anyone. In the meantime some others were seated.. given drinks.. and probably had orders taken... we were forgotten. After seating 3 next to us and they were served, We quietly stood up and left. I dont like to make a scene you just end up like the other reviewer I just read... dont want hair in my potato. Lesson learned. Avoid this dillons till they hire someone with more experience it customer service. Never even got to try the food but based on the reviews I'm glad we saved our money and went to logans roadhouse."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited Dillions on a Tuesday evening, opting for a less crowded night.

As expected attendance was light and we were seated promptly.
Our orders were brought to our tables fairly promptly but the young man delivering them (not our server) was in such a haste to leave that he never bothered asked us if we needed any condiments.  He inquired who had what meal, dropped the plates then promptly turned around and walked off.  I had to stop him mid stride while he was departing to ask for a bottle of Tabasco. Not the most service minded employee.  However our waitress was friendly and a little more attentive.

Now onto the meals.  My wife ordered the smoked salmon and I the BBQ sliced beef brisket.  According to her, the salmon was seasoned very nicely, flavorful and delicious.  However my brisket seemed a bit dry. Flavor wise it was average but it lacked the moistness one expects from a good cut of BBQ brisket.

The ambiance of the restaurant is spectacular.  The large oval aquarium which is shared with the zoo makes up part of the restaurant's wall is visible from anywhere you're seated. The several sharks and rays swimming around it made for a nice view and great excitement for a couple of young children at another table.  Obviously, the tables situated next to the aquarium will have the best view.

The service could use a little improvement and the brisket more moist but overall we enjoyed our visit."}
{"text":"We ordered take out for a family dinner to celebrate the mother-in-laws birthday. We were told it would be ready in 20 minutes. The sister-in-law and I show up 30 minutes later (just in case they needed more time because we ordered a lot) and were instructed by the hostess to pick it up at the bar. We stood at the bar for a good ten minutes and were completely ignored. It was getting really uncomfortable because we could tell they were ignoring us on purpose! Several workers would make eye contact, I would smile, start to speak and they would quickly look down and then walk away. Finally we were addressed, paid, waited for another ten minutes, got the food and left.

The food was blah, nothing special. We ordered two racks of beef ribs (very little meat on the bone, pulled pork (watery and bland), brisket (came submerged in vinegar and tasted like it was boiled), mac and cheese, and coleslaw (good). I didn't get sick so I guess that is worth 2 stars...

Now back to the service, does anyone know why you have customers pick up their take out from the bar? Raising my hand. Yes you in the back. \"um so they order more while they wait?\" Good! Now how do you get them to order more? Raising my hand and waiving frantically. \"ummmm, don't ignore them and you ask them if they wanted a drink while they wait?\" Fantastic, gold star for you.

They could have squeezed an extra $20 out of us. Instead they only got the money from the food...and that is all they will ever get. No repeat business here."}
{"text":"We had a great lunch & excellent service today. The portions are very ample, & we had to take the leftovers home. We sat next to the giant shark tank, but next time maybe we'll sit outside & watch the flamingos. Kudos to Joy for taking such good care of us & bringing my hubby a sample of burnt ends & sauces to try to help him figure out what to order."}
{"text":"We come here often for dinner it use to be a really good place to come out but lately it just seems this place has gone down in service came out here about a month ago and service / Waitress  were terrible sat at table for about 30 min before the waitress finally came over and took our drinks and order finally after a long 30 minutes again the food came out cold the sad thing is they were not even busy on this day we talked to a manager and he gave us a discount on our bill and gave us a free dessert so I thought okay manager did tried to make things better so I'll give them another chance we'll the joke was on me hahaha 
We came out here again to bring my niece for her birthday and was very disappointed with there service it sucked  also informed the waiter it was my nieces birthday they took for ever to get our drinks orders after we ate the waiter he came out with a bowl of ice cream and said here is the birthday thing and walked away very disappointed with Dillion's BBQ was hoping for a wonderful birthday dinner for my niece ..this was my experience lately with Dillion's BBQ but pretty sure I won't be coming back again"}
{"text":"Dillon's makes really great barbecued baby back ribs. It's the only thing I get here...no reason to try anything else it's so darned good. Yum. Onion rings have nice light batter. Apple turnover with ice cream dusted with cinnamon is tasty, too. Generous portions, so lots of tasty leftovers. 

Corn on the cob is plain yellow corn--would not order that here (another diner did). I wonder why they (the restaurant owners) don't get the pale white corn that is juicier and tastier....

Service is attentive and efficient. 

This Dillon's location is attached to the Wildlife World Zoo and features aquarium displays, including a large shark aquarium. I loved watching the sharks and other fish swim by while eating. Some kids got pretty excited about the aquarium, but thankfully, quieted down after a bit. --The restaurant acoustics seem to make for a rather loud place."}
{"text":"It is really hard to rate Dillon's without talking about the zoo/aquarium it's attached to because the main attraction of the dinning area IS part of the aquarium...
A shark tank.
or, if you pick the patio, the flamingo island.
However, it's a conversation worth having because Dillon's produces some of the best Kansas City BBQ in Arizona. Smokey and sweet with just a touch of \"twang\" - there isn't a dish on their menu that I wouldn't (or haven't) tried.
Plus...
You get to eat it staring down a shark or two."}
{"text":"The service was terrible order appetizers never came  food was made in correct. Never again even on a bet."}
{"text":"We came here for our daughter's birthday lunch. We let two servers know it was her birthday and they didn't care to do ANYTHING! Our server (her name was Devyn) was absolutely terrible!! She was VERY rude! She OBVIOUSLY wanted to go home and were obviously her last table. On top of the horrendous service from everyone there, the food was disgusting. This could have been such a good experience, but it was terrible. Just sad."}
{"text":"Really good barbeque and drinks. Whenever we receive guests from out of town, Dillon is the first restaurant we choose because of the delicious entrees and appetizers and drinks."}
{"text":"We love eating at all the different Dillon's locations.  Staff is always pleasant and food is always good.  The onion rings are light and crisp and a must have appetizer with every visit.  My husband loves the macaroni and cheese with whatever meat he has."}
{"text":"Been there twice, first time it was just ok so I thought that maybe just a bad day for them. The second time wasn't any better, just ok BBQ way over price for such common food. The service wasn't even that good. Go to Bobby Q for real BBQ that you will love!"}
{"text":"Awesome onion rings ... For only $2! 
Love this place.... Sit near the giant aquarium and watch the Sharks over dinner."}
{"text":"Decent food and process.  Ok service.  Terrible beer selection.  Fried pickles were interesting.  Wings were good. Brisket quesadilla was also good. Best thing about it was the convenience of cheap beers after walking through the zoo for 4 hours."}
{"text":"After visiting the Zoo we ventured into the Restaurant to eat and watch the Sharks and Rays swim in the Dinning Room tank. Service was good. Our Server was point on. It was very busy I might add.Our drinks were delivered quickly and never were we with an empty glass. Food arrived at good intervals. Pleased with the food choices on the Menu. The food choices we made were Brisket Sandwich/Potatoe Salad, Fish Tacos/slaw and potatoe salad, Pulled Pork Sandwich/Fries, Kids Shrimp/fries. Everything was very good!
Lots of meat  on Sandwiches and potatoe salad and slaw are homemade and very good. We enjoyed our lunch and will frequent the Restaurant."}
{"text":"I've ate here several times and the food is always very good, but this most recent visit was one of the worst from a service perspective.  Our waitress either forgot to put our order I. Or they forgot to make it in the kitchen (not sure which), but we lost over 90 mi Utes waiting for food which was super awesome considering we had 4 hungry kids with us.  Not sure this will be the last time we eat here, but will certainly think twice next time.

However, the manager (Carl) was totally accountable and took care of the bill and gave the girls ice cream.  Nice recovery!"}
{"text":"We have been to this location numerous times...never again! First of all do not go here on a Saturday during the day if you do not have kids because the place is wild. Kids are running around everywhere!! The food has always been good but this time my asparagus was either overcooked or out of a can. The sandwich was okay hardly any meat and the prices have gone up again!! Waitress never refilled our drinks. For the money you can get a much better meal somewhere else!!!"}
{"text":"The food here was very good.  I gave a three star rating because the servers are very slow and the place could use a good scrub.  I liked the view of the aquarium.  The restauraunt is a little muggy and stuffy.  I felt as if I could not breathe.  The place needs to add some sort of air filtration system."}
{"text":"For starters, we waited forever to be seated, was told 20 minutes, not so, 45 minutes later when asking about our seating, and after seeing several people who came in after us being seated, we were told we would be next.  Very frustrating to see another three groups seated before us still.   When the food arrived one meal was missing, the person bringing the food to the table said he would be back with the missing meal, after most of us had eaten about half of our meal the waitress stopped by, she did not even notice that one meal was missing, we had to request she find out what was going on with the missing meal.   After dinner, there was a desert ordered, it didn't come, and didn't come - when the waitress finally came back she was told to forget about the desert and just bring the bill.  When the bill arrived, low and behold we were still charged for the desert.  I have many things that are not good to say about the meal and the service but will leave it at this.  We will not put ourselves through this again and we will not recommend this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with our 6 kids right before going to the zoo and we loved it. The atmosphere is great and they have aquariums around which kept the kids busy. The food was also delicious."}
{"text":"We went to this place Twice while visiting our favor8 zoo yesterday, once 4 lunch outside while viewing the flamingos from the patio under misters & l8er 4 dinner inside w/ the AMAZING aquarium. Both Xs were THOROUGHLY ENJOYABLE in Food, Service & Experience! 

   We were pretty famished after going all over the grounds running on empty in the heat & ready 2 c what offerings we could have from their extensive menu. We were pleasantly surprised 2 c there were several selections for us Veg~heads 2 choose from even tho they r known 4 their Bbq. Yay 4 us!! 

   Already a gr8 start, we were promptly greeted by an AWESOMELY ATTENTIVE server named HEATHER(server 40422) who took our drink & appetizer orders & single handed-ly gave not only us but the ENTIRE PATIO the most STELLAR service I've seen (esp 4 a place that busy)! Flustered was not in her vocabulary as she simultaneously got us started, other's served their orders/refills, clearing pl8es, & wrapped up people closing their bills complete w/ their discount coupons, making it Look effortless all w/ a commendably friendly & professional winning attitude. This gal truly was impressive & I almost luved observing/witnessing/hearing her in action as much as the flamingos ~ WOW!!

   So we ordered passion fruit tea, Portabello Spinach Artichoke Dip 2 start, Peach salad w/ prickly pear vinigarette dressing & their Spinach enchilada platter. Pl8es were Huge w/ Generous portions & gr8 present8ion. As hungry as we were, we actually had 2 box up what we couldn't finish & run it our 2 the car. Everything we had became an instant fave & when I'm craving cold/cool food I'll have 2 go w/ the Peach salad which also had craisins, candied walnuts/pecans over combin8ion greens & Perfectly complimented w/ the Prickly Pear Vinigarette dressing (no arm~twisting needed). No room 4 dessert even tho there were def a few I put on the 2~try list 4 l8er. 

   Early eve had the expected w8 (esp since we showed up w/o a reserv8ion) & we opted 4 outside patio again if it meant getting seated sooner, but much 2 our surprise we were asked if we'd like 2 dine inside near aquarium as 1 was cleared/opened up. Can we say YAY Again 4 the unexpected upgrade? Nice~Woo~hoo!!

   We got seated right next 2 the aquarium near 1 corner of the curv8ure. Our w8ress this time was the very nice efficient Tobie (server 96534) who greeted us fairly quickly getting our order of their award winning onion rings started & tried the hibiscus green tea which was just as thirst quenchingly good as the passion fruit we had earlier. She was also a pretty Gr8 server ~ never had 2 w8 4 refills or our bill when ready. The only w8 other than 2 b seated of course was 4 our items 2 b prepared & nothing took very long ~ not 2 mention taking in all the beautiful marine life swimming right by us. I went w/ the Spinach Quesadilla & my companion ordered the Prickly Peach Salad this time which had an interesting marmalade blended in2 the dressing. Yummy!! 

   The onion rings were pretty 1derful as was the Spinach Quesadilla & all the spinach artichoke dishes I'd highly recommend 4 those that like that kind of dip. The only thing I might suggest was the red onions being sauteed instead of raw even though it was still very good cut in2 julienne style pieces as well as ensuring all the diced tomato on our Spinach enchiladas r all ripe. Also the chips were very good tho just a couple a little over~fried, but some may prefer them that way. Why no sweet potato fries @ this loc8ion? Def woulda tried them... We really enjoyed the aquarium & knew not 2 expect a quiet uneventful dining experience as there is going 2 b excited kids about in addition 2 the hussle & bustle of any good establishment. 

   Really wish some parents/grandparents would b better overseers of children/toddlers. This is NOT a charity daycare/kiddy playland 2 let them run rampantly unattended as servers already have enough obstacles w/o having 2 watch 4 tripping over ur kids while attempting 2 get full trays of HOT food 2 their tables. Really, r u KiDding me?? I'm sure they'd b the 1st 2 scream lawsuit if that very possibly happened 2!! That's really sad when a stranger cares more by watching/preventing something bad from happening 2 them SEVERAL Xs throughout our meal ~ Rediculous!! Yeah, go back 2 drinking but next time don't bring the kids or 4 gosh sakes pay 4 a babysitter since u don't watch them, not 2 mention the choking hazard every time I get knocked in2 from behind while trying 2 eat... Geesh!!
 
   Again had no room 4 dessert so that will have 2 come l8er but Dillon's easily became a FAVE place that we'll frequent whenever we can/find ourselves out this way which is usually when frequenting the Perfectly paired 1Derful zoo!"}
{"text":"The dining experience alone could get this place a 5 star rating. I love being able to watch the sharks with my daughter. She finds them fascinating as i imagine most kids would.  We always order the onion rings which i think are the best ive ever had. They are very light. The brisket was to die for. My father could not stop raving about it and hes not easily impressed.   I had the potato bacon soup which was so-so but the bbq more than made up for it. We all shared the brownie and ice cream since it was massive and it too was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Meh is all i can really say and I'll tell you why! My family and I wanted to check out this location for dinner on a friday night.  We enjoy the other locations so why not try this one right?! Well I call ahead to see if I can make reservations for 630 pm. I was told they only take reservations for parties of 8 or more. Ok....whatever...its friday night we will get there early. When we arrive we are told that it will be a 15 minute wait for us which was a party of 4 and a baby. So we sit and wait....and wait as other parties of 3....4....5...and 6 are seated ....mind you who arrived AFTER us. 

My step dad then walks up to the hostess stand...which has 5 people up there who are incredibly rude...and ask why they were seated before us. 20 minutes has gone by at this point. They tell us \"they had reservations\". Ummm wtf EXCUSE ME?!?! I was told you only take reservations of parties 8 or more. By now Im beyond pissed off! We are told there is 2 more couples before us and then we will be seated. Another 10 minutes goes by... 5 more parties are seated(now its 30 min) and my step dad walks up to stand by the hostess booth. One hostess...with the biggest attitude looks at him and says \"Dont worry you are next!\" Look betch we should have been sat 15 minutes ago!! With me working in customer service myself....that crap does not fly with me! When we are finally called back....one of the hostess says...\"party of 5?\" Are you serious? Are you that stupid that you are bringing 5 menus? Yea cause my 3 month old can eat ribs! Effing MORON!

Once seated the server was nice....she was on top of things and the food was decent. There were a few bugs crawling around by a table near us. The patron sitting at that table mentioned something to the bus boy... he simply stepped on the bug and stated \"its only a bug!\" Kind of gross but you ARE at a zoo.  

Will i eat here again...probably not but I do want to come back to go to the zoo since i have not yet been. 

My advice if you want BBQ.....go to the other locations and have a better experience!"}
{"text":"Family friendly restaurant great for the kids.  Seated immediately without await. We received great attentive service.  The food is good for run of the mill barbecue and fried food fare.  The aquarium is the best reason to go here, especially for the kids.  That carries this rating to a solid, family restaurant, 4 stars."}
{"text":"Holy salt lick Batman...had lunch here today with my mother and kids.  For a restaurant that I generally enjoy, this was by far the worst meal I have EVER had.  Ordered the Red Devil Pork Sandwich, hoping for a little spice with my BBQ.  Instead I got a mouth full of over salted meat that made my mom gag when she tried it.  I have never sent a meal back, but this was absolutely inedible. The restaurant was kind enough to comp us the $.40 (yes forty cents) difference to replace the sandwich I could not eat.  It was so bad I couldn't even eat anything else and had to get my food to go.  Not my usual experience with this place, however its was the first time eating at this location.  I guess the bill for the aquarium really makes it hard for them to swallow the cost of an overpriced sandwich.

Update:  Had the take home replacement order today.  The pulled pork sandwich was good, however I would have preferred to have my potato salad without the black hair.  Really????? You would think they would be a little careful."}
{"text":"I placed a to-go order for two of the dinners - the Burnt Ends dinner and the Pulled Pork dinner. The hostess/server found out it was my first visit, and she happily gave me a take-out menu and enough time to absorb the contents and make up my mind. She also provided good advice when I asked for input on some of the menu entrees. When I got home, I checked the contents of the bag, and I found that my order had been filled perfectly! The meats were tender and flavorful, and the mild sauce was sweet and smoky, as advertised. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Good size portions & decent prices. $2 onion rings were really good & certainly can't beat the price!!! Good service. Overall we were very pleased & will go back again!"}
{"text":"The manager Kyle was so nonchalant and rude about a situation we had while dining here. The restaurant had messed up our order twice in a previous dining experience and had offered us a $25 gift card to come back , so we did and then as we go to check out we talk to Kyle (the manager on duty at the time) about reimbursing us the $25 gift card as promised and he proceeded to say he knew nothing about it and was so uninformed about it, not to mention was rude and could careless about our experience ... I work in a restaurant and there ought to be more communication and always put on a smile no matter what. Overall, bad customer service."}
{"text":"Dillon's is a great place to eat! I love their location at Scorpion Bay on Lake Pleasant. They also have amazing catering."}
{"text":"Arrived today 10 minutes early for 1230p reservation today to be told I didn't have one.  When I stated I made it with Mckenzie I was told they have multiple people named Mckenzie.  Finally hostess found my reservation.  
Food was ordered after a lengthy weight at the table.  Order arrived 30 minutes after placing it.  Food was mediocre.  Green beans were ice cold..BBQ  didn't taste authentic.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Stephanie in the bar was amazing! Very helpful, knowledgeable and friendly! The onion rings are a must! Ask for the ancho sauce. Baby back ribs are wonderful! My husband rates the brisket a 7. Beer is cold!"}
{"text":"A little bit expensive but oh so good. I love their spicy sauce it's not that hot to me but has a great heat and sweetness to it. You definitely get plenty of food for the price. I would say check out the zoo first and then eat that way u can take the leftovers home. I love seeing all the sharks and stingrays In their aquariums"}
{"text":"Accommodated a large party last minute on a Saturday night.  Very good food always and the staff is always friendly!  Very happy with Dillions always!"}
{"text":"I was told ahead of time this would be the best BBQ I've ever had. I question if the person that told me this has actually ever had BBQ before. The atmosphere was great especially eating in the room with the shark tank. But the food was lack-luster and I would not call that KC BBQ. Maybe they are using KC Masterpiece as their BBQ sauce... which in itself isn't Kansas City BBQ either. 

  No one's meal was all that great and if we weren't already there for the zoo we would had been even more displeased with out trip."}
{"text":"Wow.. All I can say is pubes in my baked potato.. 

We came to Dillon's after we went to zoo. We had the Groupon deal and on the deal it says one Groupon per transaction. I called a ahead of time to make sure I could do separate checks for me and my wife. 

Anyway, we get to our table and the kids are tired and ornery. We tell the waitress we will do four separate checks between us and our friends. The waitress seemed annoyed.. We tried to be quick with ordering and knowing what we wanted. Apparently we were not nice enough because like I said earlier.. I got pubes in my food. 

The manager came over and offered to make me a new plate.. Really?? I just got pubes in my food. No thanks! 

He offered nothing else besides that. 

I am disgusted with this place and would advise you to stay away..

This is at a Zoo.. Expect ornery kids. I called ahead and asked about the Groupon deal.. The customer service there does not exist!

I am still sick to my stomach thinking about this.."}
{"text":"I have been here twice the first time was terrible service and terrible food. The second we had family visiting so I agreed to give this place a second try because they wanted to eat where there was an aquarium. It was still terrible! I would rather eat a BARS hot dog off a gas grill at a back yard BBQ that's been sitting out for hours than ever eat here again!"}
{"text":"So I REALLY wanted to like this place. On a whim I went with my two children and we were seated quickly.  Then we SAT....and sat....and SAT some more.  THREE servers walked past us before Steve finally asked if our server had been over yet.  And I will say that he was the highlight of the entire experience. 

It was MAD loud in there.  The music was loud which made everyone in there have to talk louder to even be heard. 

I get employing the younger crowd. But if I wanted to eat with 10 teen agers I would have stayed home and let my son have his friends over. I wasn't sure who even worked there as they were all dressed like they had just left fun time at the park.  Is there no real dress code? I also have an issue with thier language.  I have no issue with people cussing but I do have an issue with a 17 year old girl cussing at another teeny bopper that I guess works there as she was kind of cleaning the carpet with a sweeper, when there are people there with little kids.  When the older couple next to me left without ordering I was ready to follow.

When our food finally came it was ok.  I wasn't hugely impressed by any of it.  I am really disappointed with all of it. I am hoping that the zoo portion is better than that and hopefully the zoo animals get better service!.

Needless to say, the BEST part was our server Steve- Or John if the service sucks.  LOL  Steve, thank you for making us laugh and being the highlight of our meal."}
{"text":"We went to the zoo and saw reviews beforehand (when trying to plan our day) that we should try Dillon's BBQ. 
There was not much wait time which was great.  When we were seated, there was a kid climbing on one of the seats at our table so I requested another table.  I explained to the girl that I did not want to sit at the table next to another table that allowed their child to roam freely at the next table.  The girl said the table next to us was reserved.  There were other tables available, but I did not want to argue because we were tired after spending hours at the zoo. 

Food: 
Very good food overall.  I loved the salmon and artichoke salad.  I wish they had better dressing options, but decided on ranch.  They could have better dressings for the artichoke and salmon salad. 

My husband ordered the chicken fried chicken, daughters got the Dillon's angus burger, and a chicken club. All food items were very good! 

Service: 
That's the downfall for us.  The person seating us could have tried to understand that we do not want to sit with someone else's kid coming over to our table. 

My husband requested extra salt on his fries and I requested extra artichokes in my salad.  Either the chef forgot or our server, Torrie, forgot to submit those requests.  The fries tasted like there was NO salt at all, and saltless fries are not great. Hardly any artichokes, which I predicted from ordering menu items with artichokes before.  Lots of places skimp on artichokes, but USUALLY they add extra when asked.  Charge me more.  That's fine! Just add more artichokes.  I wanted the salad with artichokes because I like artichokes.  Or, say no... then I can order something else.

None of the four of us had refills for our drinks.  Not one refill.  Server was sweet.  She asked us about the food, but never came back to get us more drinks.  

Even if we're at the zoo again I cannot see dining there again which is a bummer because I thought the food was pretty good, but servers should fill drinks and put in food requests."}
{"text":"These restaurants are always busy for a reason!  Great food!!  Definitely our family's go-to place for BBQ!  Onion rings are the best!"}
{"text":"Great time with the family! The food was great and the service was phenomenal. The kids really enjoyed sitting by the sharks, making it like a date night for me and the wife. I would recommend the onion rings for $2 you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! If you have never been, dine-in is a must around their giant center piece shark aquarium. I particularly like to call in orders for pick up because they never take longer than 15 minutes to make my food, which is exactly how long it takes for me to get there. Air Force veteran owned and very vet friendly. This is the only place around that I have seen that has parking for Purple Heart recipients right up front, so I always have a spot. They now have two Purple Heart parking spaces, which is two more than anywhere else I have ever been. My two favorite dishes are the Country Fried Chicken, which is always moist and tender, and their \"Sweet Heat\" chicken wings. The servers are always happy, and I have yet to have ever had anything less than perfect service and savory meals."}
{"text":"The place Is great the food has been awesome every time we've come. The staff is alway nice and the bar is great on game day. It's a must, definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"My family and I went here Monday after spending the morning on the river. The inside was nicer than I was expecting and the shark tank is really cool. We loved the beer special for happy hour as well! 
The food was all very bland and way too expensive for how mediocre it was. 
Our server was less than attentive, and the manager who stopped by after our server rang my sandwich incorrectly was pleasant. 
I don't think I would ever return."}
{"text":"This place is probably the best BBQ place I have ever been to. The atmosphere was great, good music (country) and a huge shark tank right in the middle. The service was great and very friendly. 

I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was juicy and delicious, the sauce was sweet and tangy with just enough heat to let you know it was spicy. For an appetizer we had the fried pickles and onion rings and they were both delicious. 

I would definitely recommend this to anyone visiting the area. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Another place I wanted to love- real smoked BBQ served in an aquarium, what's not to love.  I fly around the globe to snorkel coral reefs, the thought of sitting next to 66,000 gallons of water with sharks and tangs was so appealing. I also adore flamingos, and the covered outdoor seating overlooks the flamingo pond at the zoo.

So we get to the restaurant and it's loud. Longer we're seated, the louder it gets, ridiculously so. Aquariums and loud noise just don't go together. For great food, it's forgivable.  For ill conceived food, it's tortuous.

I admit, the happy hour onion rings were great- a buck a serving whereas they are normally seven bucks a serving.  Two orders of rings as apps and the amount was just right- 6-8 rings per serving.  It all went down when my food arrived- wait, I take that back, it went down when I asked my server about about my selection and she said it was good. She should have been honest before the order, not afterwards when I was commenting on it to her.

What was so heinous about this dish? It was the bruschetta topped with beef brisket- the menu description sounded great- bruschetta with brisket, diced tomatoes, parmesan cheese, and a special sauce.  When you talk tomatoes and parmesan on bruschetta, you think Italian. It's unavoidable. The bruschetta was properly prepared. The brisket was tender and melted in the mouth.  The diced tomatoes were in the center of the plate, allowing the diner to control the amount on each slice.  On top of each piece of brisket something red and shiny- a sun dried tomato plumped with olive oil? There was parmesan sprinkled atop. Take a bite to the mouth and then YECK- it was topped with cocktail sauce!  As in ketchup and horseradish cocktail sauce!  And copiously topped. Who in the world decided that cocktail sauce for shrimp should be renamed \"Special Sauce\" and put on top of beef? What were they thinking?  I love it on shrimp. I love a cream horseradish sauce on beef- without parmesan cheese. But horseradish and parmesan? Not compatible, not remotely, no way Jose. OMG if Marcella Hazen or Lidia Bastianich had been there they would have been mortified. 

The special sauce should have been something loaded with garlic, like a Cuban mojo made of pounded cloves blended with olive oil. That would have hit it out of the park instead of fouling then striking out.

So I scraped as much off as I could, but that taste in my mouth, it wouldn't go away. That of course was when the server stopped by and then expressed her true sentiments on the concoction.

My companion had the St Louis style ribs, steak fries and cole slaw. Pretty fool proof and hard to screw up.  He liked it, the ribs looked meaty albeit very trimmed down. I'm used to full racks of ribs resembling a pan flute, wide and nearly a foot long at one end, tapering down like a wedge to a tip at the other end.

So, love the shark tank, love the flamingos, was very put off by the food. I am shuddering to think I actually ate three pieces- it must have been the Blue Moon ale I had first numbing my buds- I never drink so it doesn't take much.

So I'm kissing it off, trying something else on the menu is too scary and I already have a place to go for bbq."}
{"text":"There weren't many options for a vegetarian such as myself, especially since I'm not the salad type. I was forced to choose off the sides menu. I ordered 3 orders of onion rings with 3 different types of barbacue sauce on the side. All three sauces were great! I really enjoyed the onion rings and want to come back to the zoo just to try them again. I loved how they have sharks in the dinning area. Really cool spot to eat at. The waitress was very friendly and fast. Free refills on soda made this place even cooler. You can get a stamp on your wrist here so that you can leave the zoo and come back without being charged again. Dillon's is great!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and if possible even better service!!  Brittney was our server couldn't ask for better!!  She was over the top!!  Totally recommend!!"}
{"text":"The food at this location in the World Wild Life Zoo is OK.  The huge fish tank with sharks in it is more than entertaining for the kids though and the restaurant provides a welcome relief from the normal run of the mill food at parks like this. We eat here every time we come to this zoo."}
{"text":"Pretty similiar to my meal at the other location. The only difference was the view of course as you can sit right next to shark tank or an alligator. This is still a great BBQ place and your food will always be solid. Once again, I had the brisket and again despite no bark, it is tasty and they load the meat up on the platter or sandwich. The steak fries are standard, the onion rings are still a bargain at 2 bucks and the mac and cheese is quite tasty as well. We got there at 11 AM and it was getting crowded already on a weekend, but the early bird gets the good view in this world."}
{"text":"Tried this place with the family. The wait for a table was less time than the told us. It was super busy too and for good reason. Our waitress was very sweet and refilled drinks promptly with out being asked. The shark tank was wonderful entertainment for both my young children while waiting on our food. The food came out quickly and the food was amazing. We ordered a Bloody Mary from the bar and it was great especially for the price of $3.25. We left with tons of food because the portions are large. We could not have been happier with the experience."}
{"text":"A place for celebrations! We wanted to go to a restaurant where it was special for our daughter's graduation. We did not want to be stuck in a crowded place with other families with graduates. So, we choose Dillon's out by the World Wildlife Zoo. There was 7 in our party and they found us a table, primed for shark viewing. You can't beat $2 onion rings. It was served with rich ranch dressing. Our party demolished 2 orders. The fried pickles were good, too. They were crisp and juicy, served with ranch and buffalo sauce. Our party enjoyed brisket quesadillas, pulled pork plates and sandwiches, and cheeseburgers. Everything was delicious. The Carolina pulled pork sandwich was enjoyed greatly with spicy baked beans. My husband thought the regular pulled pork was a little bland and preferred my robust rack of baby back ribs. The slaw was unremarkable. The service was lovely and quick. The ambiance is fantastic. Who doesn't want to celebrate dining with the sharks. The graduation party was a success!"}
{"text":"Just okay. Calling in an order takes forever and the food is okay. Will still keep going because they are the only restaurant out here this far west and south on the 303. Prime Rib is what the are known for but its just okay."}
{"text":"Where's the option for 1/2 stars?  :)  So we went to Dillon's the other night with the parents who have been here several times (wife & I had been to the T-Bird location and didn't leave all that impressed) so we thought we would give it one more shot.  Upon arrival the entrance off Northern Ave. is a bit dark at night.  Parked go inside where many folks are waiting and upon asking how long the wait is, we are told 45 minutes.... DANG! OK it was Saturday night and the snowbirds are still in town.  So the hostesses need to figure out that if a table seats 3 it will seat 4 ... so the groups of 3 that came in AFTER us should have been seated AFTER us, vs. before.  We waited over 45 minutes, but killed some of the time walking into the restaurant looking at the tanks and such.  Finally we get seated, the chairs are odd and like sitting in a bucket, the decor certainly does not fit a KC BBQ place and many of the lights weren't working, but I know they took over from the Tiberon so that may be part of it.  I will say the food was better this time, the sweet heat sauce has some kick to it and went well with my dish of the Burnt Ends.  Wife had the beef ribs but preferred them from Memphis Best BBQ vs. Dillon's.  Will we come back? - possibly ... will we rush back?  probably not."}
{"text":"My wife and I used a Groupon for our first visit to Dillons. We were seated quickly even though the place was packed. Our server was exceptional. The food was very good and generous portions. The $1 onion rings were great! 
  This can be a pretty noisy place. Quite a few groups having dinner. 
  The shark aquarium was next to our table and gave our dinner experience a twist.     The staff is very familiar with using Groupons. Our server told us they sold 12,000 the first time around and it caused some long wait times for people. We waited a couple of months to use ours. Overall we really enjoyed our dinner and will be back. If we use a Groupon again we will wait to use it like we did this time."}
{"text":"The food was really good and I had been skeptical since it's in the zoo. I thoroughly enjoyed the bbq half chicken and their onion rings."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in years. 

First off, we get there and they sat my pregnant wife and I at a table in the middle of a walkway. Then, the narrow area between me me and the man behind me turned into a walkway for all the servers who never once even bothered apologizing when they consistently bumped in to me.

Then I went to order. Well I had been looking forward to the spare ribs on the menu, but when I ordered they were \"sold out.\" My meal came out: beef ribs (that had both the taste and texture of leather) and brisket (that tasted something like sliced roast beef soaked in ketchup). Well it's a good thing I wasn't to keen on the beef ribs because as I took my second bite out of one boom I was hit in the back of the head by another server and dropped it on the floor. Once again, he didn't bother apologizing or bringing out more.

After our order came out I counted four plates of \"sold out\" spare ribs that came out of the kitchen and were delivered to people who ordered after us.  I attempted to flag down one of the servers.....any of them would have been nice......but was unsuccessful, apparently refills on your drink are completely out of the question.

Finally I waited 20 minutes for my credit card to come back from wherever it went and I left.

I will never go back to this place, the food was terrible and the service was worse. Avoid it, there are much better barbecue joint in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I usually eat here and always have a great experience.  But the server I had today was very slow!  I always have Stephanie in the bar area and always have a five star experience..."}
{"text":"Pros:
The ambiance alone gives this place three stars. My husband and I went on a Saturday night and we're seated right away which I thought was amazing for how busy it was. We managed to snag a table right against the beautiful shark tank. 

Cons:
The food was not good. I don't mind paying a good price for a good meal but my prime rib was tough soggy and bland. The roll was dry and hard. The baked potato was the highlight of my $22.00 plate 

The waitress knew little to nothing about the fish. I read in other reviews that Dillon's only benefit from the view and are not responsible for the fish but come on you could learn a little about them. On that note several of the sharks and rays had open wounds. 

End result is I will probably come back but only for a salad or appetizer type lunch just to enjoy the shark tank"}
{"text":"My 4 year old son and I really enjoyed our experience at Dillon's at World Wildlife Zoo & Aquarium! I ordered a very delicious Dillon's house salad which included egg, tomato, bacon, and croutons with ranch. Very simple but so tasty! I tried the half portion of pulled BBQ pork on Texas toast. The BBQ sauce was awesome! Best of all we had an enjoyable experience sitting in front of the shark tank."}
{"text":"We always go here after we go to the zoo. Really authentic barbecue, great sides, and my kids love the smiley face fries that come with the kids meals.
They have delicious margaritas too! Great for mom after a hot zoo trip :)
The aquarium's shark tank extends into the dining area so we always sit nearby. They also have a patio that overlooks the flamingos.
My only complaint is that if they're busy, we usually get our food before our drinks. After walking around in the heat all day, we are ready for our soda/water/margarita/beer. 
Servers are always friendly and management usually makes rounds asking how are food is, etc. Great lunch/dinner place all around!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times and the food is very good.the barbecue is tender and tasty and our server was awesome . Try the pretzel app. Perhaps the best pretzel I have ever had."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here today for the first time. Overall, it was between okay and good. The service was very good. The shark tank is very cool and the place was clean. We ordered onion rings, burnt ends, pulled chicken, pulled pork. For sides we had the mac and cheese, beans, and green beans. It was clear everything was made on site, and that should be great....but, the seasoning was nowhere to be found. You go to all that trouble to make sides from scratch, use some salt and pepper. The onions rings, no seasoning and the mac and cheese bland. The chicken and burnt ends and pulled pork no seasoning. To make it worse, all meat was drowned in bbq sauce. It was all you could taste. It takes so long to smoke meat properly, let it shine. It was disappointing."}
{"text":"Visiting the wildlife a park and decided to have lunch first. The kids were excited to stare at the shark tank for a while. Our waitress, Lynda, was excellent and always very attentive to what we needed. Started off with the onion ring appetizer (only $2) and the onion rings were surprisingly good. Not overcooked and not greasy. So far, so good.
Unfortunately, everything else was somewhat disappointing. I had the Red Devil Pork sandwich. It was fairly spicy and the sausage was pretty good but the pork was a little bland. The sauce was somewhat greasy and quickly saturated the bun. Actually had to discard part of the bottom of the bun. The Mac and cheese side was pretty good but not a fan of the corn added in. My wife got the blackened tilapia. Not very blackened and just \"ok\". The kids got bland looking hot dogs with 5 smiley-face fries. 
Overall, OK food which was not worth the price. As another reviewer mentioned, this place could be outstanding if they took the food more seriously."}
{"text":"Excellent Thanksgiving meal. We were impressed with how personable the employees were, and with their exceptional customer service. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I am happy to have this option at a zoo.  Most amusement parks and zoos only offer their overpriced snack bar areas, so having a full restaurant is pretty cool.  We have been to this place every time we visit the Wildlife Zoo.  This last visit was the best of all of them.  Food is ok, nothing to write home about, but it is good.  Last time I had a hamburger and it was pretty good.   We usually sit by the shark tank, but this last time we decided to sit on the patio.  It gets a little loud, mainly because the flamingos are so vocal.  Wow those birds are noisy.  Beautiful, but very, very loud.  So if you want a little quieter area, maybe inside is a better choice."}
{"text":"Dillons is wonderful to begin with and now it has Alicia (FeFe).  She's professional knowledgeable and makes a wonderful suggestions. But wait....there's more..she is also  extremely personable. She made us feel very welcome like we had known her for years.  You can't beat wonderful service like that and the good food."}
{"text":"Went to the zoo and Dillons for the very first time on 1/3/15.  We had an amazing day.  The zoo is really cool. After a long fun day we were starving, so we headed into Dillons.  We were a party of eight, 4 adults and 4 kids.  We were greeted by their friendly staff and seated quickly.  We ordered the Nacho's and onion rings.  The onion rings were good but I thought the nachos could have used more BBQ meat and cheese.  They were okay.  I ordered the pulled pork platter.  It was good, but not a Wow!  My husband and son ordered the build your own.  My husband and son liked what they ordered.  My grandkids liked the smiley face fries and shark tank.  All in all the BBQ was good, but I have had better.  As far as the service it was good.  My husband ordered a beer and it took awhile.  The prices were consistent with other bbq restaurants.    Overall it was a good experience and we would come again."}
{"text":"This place gets 4 stars primarily because of the atmosphere. We had a seat right in front of the large tank and spent our meal watching the sharks and sting ray swim and we loved it! The food was ok. It wasn't bad but it's not award winning bbq either. We started off with the fried pickles which were quite yummy. I had the turkey sandwich with smoked turkey breast and cheese on a soft roll with a large helping of steak fries. I really liked it and would most likely order it again. My son ordered the kids meal cheeseburger and he won't be ordering it again. He said it tasted like McDonalds. My husband had a spicy pulled pork sandwich with baked beans. He said it was good but the sauce was quite salty. It wasn't the sweet bbq sauce he was expecting.

The service was good, the drinks were cold and they were quick to refill them which was greatly appreciated in the heat."}
{"text":"We went to the World Wildlife Park and wanted something different.   We had a coupon and was surprised that they accepted it at this location.  Service was great.  Our server was very pregnant and worked very hard.  I can still picture her holding a large tray of food resting on her belly.  The entire time she had a smile on her face, and I was quite impressed.  She made sure that tea and soda were refilled and made sure our meal was good.  (She got a great tip!!)  At the end of the meal, the manager (we assume), stopped by to make sure we enjoyed our meal.  We did!!  We shared a grilled chicken salad and a spicy pork sandwich with fries.  more than enough for two people. They even brought us an extra plate  I was quite impressed since I could not find anything wrong  with the entire meal.  Food was very tasty and I can't wait to come back for more.  Even though it means having to drive all the way across town."}
{"text":"As a BBQ joint Dillons is middle of the road which had me tossing around between 3-4 stars. On our visit we had the NC style bbq which was somewhat close to how it should taste but was a little to heavy on the spice, We also had the brisket and a stew which were both pretty tasty. What really brought this review to 4 stars is the interesting atmosphere with the Giant Shark Tank inside, and the flamingos off the back deck. For the sole purpose of my daughter loving this place I pushed the review to 4 stars. Overall a great place to eat for families with decent food."}
{"text":"We loved being able to watch the sharks and rays while dining. My husband thought the brisket was tasty and tender. The beer cheese with pretzel is good but more beer than cheese in flavor. Loved the SW stew but their salad that accompanied it was very simple. 

FYI - Originally I was going to get the prickly pear salad but was really glad I didn't after asking for a sample of the dressing. It didn't taste like prickly pear at all and the cost of the salad was rather steep for what came on it."}
{"text":"Dillons has a couple cool locations. This being one of them and the other being up on the water at Lake Pleasant. Its a local chain which is attractive in itself. The thing I like most about this location is the giant shark tank that takes up an entire wall of the restaurant. Its also great after a day at the zoo. But the food isnt spectacular and the service is sorta hit and miss. Its not a terrible place, just dont expect an incredible experience. The prices are fair, The dining room is clean, and the location attached to the Wildlife World Zoo is unique and makes for a fun dining experience especially for families. Overall though, 3 stars. Food and service could be better here."}
{"text":"Arrived at 630 pm on Black Friday and the place was busy but we got a seat right away. My wife and I forgot about the wonderful scenery dining in.  We sat in front of the Aquarium that had sharks and sting rays (Really Kool) service was excellent with a happy smiling server.  Onion rings were an awesome appetizer. I ordered the baby back ribs with pulled pork Delicious... We have to come back here more often..."}
{"text":"First time trying this location. Fun atmosphere and quick service. We usually go to the one at lake pleasant. So we decided to try this one. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Shelby was very helpful and recommend the burnt ends platter 14.99 so we took her advice and decided to share it. We order it with the spicy bbq sauce and got steak fries and mashed potatoes for our two sides. In addition, it came with a biscut with a yummy hunny butter. The burnt ends were melt in your mouth tender and the BBQ sauce has the perfect kick. The burnt ends were served on toast.
 
The kids each had the rib dinner 6.99. Which came with 3 large ribs and a side of bbq sauce. They both subbed the fries for Mac and cheese. And later shared a chocolate sundae 2.99"}
{"text":"Can honestly say one of the biggest jokes. Is this a real restaurant?? My boyfriend and I were planning on going to the aquarium so decided to grab a bite to eat before our day started. We were seated and at first the big shark tank visible was appealing. We sat by the tank which was neat. Our server looked 15 and was sweet. She took our order and I ordered the bbq sandwich. Worst bbq meat I've ever had, could barely chew it. The bottom of the bun was soggy and fell apart. My boyfriend had to use a fork and knife with his sandwich too bc the same thing. My side dish of mac and cheese was rigatoni.. weirdest flavoring on top. I am not that picky but if you mess up mac and cheese wtf. It was gross!!! We both looked at each other and agreed that this was possibly the worst experience in a restaurant and gross food. Not to mention our food came out 4 minutes after ordering. Haha we should have taken that as a sign. If that's not bad enough during our meal I started looking around. I realized the servers all were young girls that looked 15. I felt uncomfortable for them like it wasn't legal I kid you not. I have to complain about the music. There was children in this place around the age of 5 primarily with families. The entire time we dined here they played early 2000 music with punk bands.. mostly taking back sunday loudly. I didn't see any adults running this place so it kind of explains it. We walked out laughing and questioning if we just ate at a real restaurant. Literally insane and really nasty. I can't help but laugh after this experience. My head is still spinning"}
{"text":"Where to start,  where to start. First, the food was terrible. My wife and I ordered the two meat platter-- ribs were burnt to a crisp and no meat the brisket wasn't awful. The sides-- cottage cheese and coleslaw-- were old and funky. Then there was the screaming kids at the tank with karaoke playing, loudly in the bar. Kids ordered pulled pork, which was dry as a bone, and popcorn shrimp,  which was all breading. 
Oh,  then there was the old people next to us with the Irish Setter. Wth. The dog was whimpering and jumping up and down because of the shark tank.  The table behind them was another group of old people. The table with the dog took the \"ESA\" dog and had it jump into the chair. They all laughed and laughed,  took pictures.  
People,  leave the dogs at home!! Especially in a restaurant!! I'm really tired of people lying about their emotional support animals so they can bring them into restaurants and grocery stores.  LEAVE THE DOGS AT HOME!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and mother in law dined here on 4/22/18 at about 5 pm. I absolutely love good bbq as I have had the privilege of eating at some of the finest bbq places in America. I especially love burnt ends. And to that end here is my review.

Onion rings - great. I see why they are known for them. Pretty darn close to the best I've ever had. 

Bbq sauce (sweet heat) - subtle heat up front that builds and grows into a full bloom of heat without overpowering you, delicately balanced by the sweetness all the way through. 

Potato Salad - potatoes were al dente and the overall salad was salty. First time ever I think I didn't finish potato salad. 

Fries - good steak fries but non descript. Just fries.

Burnt Ends - Ok. So in my travels in my life I've had the pleasure of enjoying burnt ends from Jack Stacks  and Arthur Bryants in KC and, being a chef myself who has smoked more than his fair share of meat, I can tell you that these were not burnt ends. It was chopped up brisket (the flat piece more than likely) on Texas Toast.  Brisket is my absolutely favorite. I know brisket in almost every incarnation. And these weren't burnt ends. No way, no how. And the meat was overdone. Smoke ring was very thin and the meat was not very flavorful. No bark whatsoever. Heck, the meat was gray all around. 

So you know i am not coming off as a jerk, as I'm not trying to at all, I gave the rib leftovers a try from my mother in law and wife who didn't find them to their liking either. 

Ribs - worse than the brisket in every way. Tough, oversmoked, dry, etc... They weren't very good at all. I have leftovers. About a full rack. Now ribs won't last in this house more than a few minutes let alone a whole almost 24 hour cycle. Why is that that I have these ribs left over still? If you need pictures I can show you but I'm really not into putting you on blast here. I don't comment on stuff usually. In fact, this might be my first. I dunno. 

Off day? Maybe. Listen. I'm not looking for anything from you. Just thought you would like to know how this experience was. I guess I'm on the fence about giving Dillons another try. More so im disappointed because I really need to find a great bbq place close to me in Waddell and I don't think I've found it yet."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to get ribs in the West Valley. It's hard to write this review because everything on the menu is great. The loaded mashed potatoes are to die for. But what's most unique is the view. You get to dine with the company of sharks and stingrays. Good for the kids. But sometimes parties good little Rowdy in the bar."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant on family vacation with 3 kids.  Kids enjoyed the big shark tank and flamingos.  Food was all pretty good.  One person in our party had the nachos and they came out cold but they quickly replaced them with a new plate of nachos.  I had the brisket and it was quite tasty!  Everyone else had a burger or an option off the kids menu and enjoyed their meal.  Good prices so overall worth the stop in!"}
{"text":"This is some dang good cooking. I just may need to ask if they sprinkle everything with MSG... I hope not! I love everything I eat there. This place is a total guilty pleasure. True SAD diet stuff going on here and I absolutely think it tastes amazing. Their onion rings are fantastic and only $3! Veggie delight ? ..because everything else is meat... They do have great mashed potatoes and seasonal veggies . Otherwise this is not grass-fed organic. Maybe I can encourage them to have their own local grass fed cows  (happy, healthy, humane please!)
4 stars until they show some sustainable efforts. (Recycling, local, ethical, humane, etc) I want to see where my food comes from. 
Thanks!

Update: 
After a kind reply from the owner and finding out they do local and recycle. I've upgraded them to 5 stars : )"}
{"text":"Usually I like the place but haven't been there in while. Too many kids working there. Girls at front kept talking with their personal conversation and we had to wait for them to finish before being acknowledged and seated. There was a group of us waiting right by them ... customers should always come first. 
Why are some of the sting rays fins look infected or something red and choppy."}
{"text":"Always a good experience on our visits.  Always great coupons available. I come here for my ribs because I can't make them at home and saves me the work of clean up too. Great ambience with shark tank view. Servers are quite busy most of the time so don't get upset if waiting.  Seating can get extremely full."}
{"text":"The best burnt ends you will ever eat in Arizona! Friendly atmosphere and great service. Can get a little busy on the weekends. The salt water tanks, beautiful fish and sharks are really cool and great for the kids. Albino alligator is over the top...never seen one before. Everything is very clean. I would not hesitate to come back or recommend to a friend or family member. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Stopped by Dillon's for lunch with a buddy.  It was Spring Break for the kids so the parking lot was full with lots of folks going to the Wild Animal Park.  The restaurant was full with a wait but we were able to get a table in the bar area.  The main dining area has a very impressive aquarium complete with sharks and stingrays.  There were tables outside next to some very noisy flamingo's!  I ordered a pulled pork sandwich and my friend ordered baby back ribs.  The pulled pork was disappointing as it was obviously scooped out of a steam table and plopped on an ordinary hamburger bun.  The pulled pork had very little smoke flavor so I made due by drowning it in BBQ sauce.  The ribs were pretty over done to the point of being charred.  Not impressed.  If you need a quick bite before or after a visit to the zoo, I guess Dillon's would fit the bill.  There are definitely better BBQ alternatives available."}
{"text":"This has been our 3rd visit to this Dillion's. We decided to go only because there was a Groupon that cost 18$ and you get to spend $30. Every plate in the restaurant is quite expensive.  We tired the BBQ last two times and it was not worth the money.
We have chicken wings for an appetizer that were good. The hot sauce is on the side so the wings stay nice and crispy. We also had the fish and it was not the great. It did not even come out with tartar sauce when we asked it too the waitress 5 minutes to bring it out. It seems they need a little updating to the restaurant. The shark tank is cool.  Oh we went there to celebrate for my wife's birthday lunch and i asked if they would sing happy birthday they said yes but never came around to sing.
They get one star for the shark tank and another for the chicken wings."}
{"text":"Not very happy with tonight's service.  The staff was extremely rude and the service was horrific.  I've been a long time customer to Dillon s and upsetting to see the decline in service.  I'm not sure if I would ever return to this location.  Beware of this location."}
{"text":"Fried pickles are pretty good, drinks are good price. Only downside I feel like it closes way to early tho!"}
{"text":"I've heard of Dillon's. I've been in the vicinity of a couple of Dillon's locations. But until this past weekend, I'd never eaten at Dillon's. And now I regret not having tried their BBQ sooner!

A friend suggested we meet at the Dillon's KC BBQ at the Wildlife Zoo on the far west side... How far west? Think 303 and Northern. My company had previously dined at their Lake Pleasant \"Bayou\", but this was the first time for each of us at this location.

I arrived a few minutes early to put our name on the list. It got busy immediately, but we didn't wait long to be seated. Even from the middle of the dining room, we had a nice view of the centerpiece Aquarium. I'm not sure what fish have to do with KC style BBQ (other than the smoked seafood items on the menu).

And I'll admit, I am not familiar with the nuances that differentiate the regional BBQ styles. But that doesn't matter when you get a server like Angelina. She was very friendly and knowledgeable, plus, she made a great recommendation. Get the \"Burnt Ends\"!

Normally I would go for ribs, but we were very satisfied with our choices. The Burnt Ends (Brisket) and Pulled Pork were very moist and flavorful. And then there were the sauces... Holy Cow! Dillon's trio of sauces are amazing! I've found my new favorite BBQ sauce and it's Dillon's traditional sauce.

The coleslaw was just average, but the BBQ baked beans made up for that. They were also really good (and meaty). Finally, ask yourself this. When was the last time you had leftovers that were just as delicious as when they were served? I won't drive past Dillon's next time!"}
{"text":"Dillon's recently took over the former location of the Tiburon Restaurant and Flamingo. My husband said his BBQ pork sandwich and the BBQ beans as his side were good. I had the portabella mushroom sandwich with a side of vegetables. (I wasn't so found of it for many reasons but the sandwich was edible) These sandwiches are on snowflake buns (The kind dusted in flour and I HATE raw flour on anything) My mushroom only filled one side of the sandwich so the other half only had tomato, raw onion and lettuce no dressing or condiment just SNOWFLAKE Bun. The vegetables were a combination of ( maybe canned) corn, chopped poblano peppers,fresh squash and very dry carrot slices that could have passed for wood. 

Service was OK.

 The menu, under Dillon's Favorites Section the last item on menu is the Chicken Alfredo Pasta and the description reads YELP about this one! $12.99 so I did!

Slight update
11-28-16
The people working here are friendly and welcoming.
Onion rings are the specialty and are very good.
Brisket was very dry.
Sides of Cole Slaw and Potato Salad were fresh made but are flavored very strangely.

{"text":"The food was ok but I'm giving the place 1 star because it was one of the worst dining experiences we have had in recent time.  First off this place should issue fly swatters with the meals, lol we spent the whole time swatting away fly's while trying to eat our meal how disgusting is that.  Then we only saw our waitress once and that was when she brought us the bill, it was at that point I ordered some desert because it sounded good, and I asked for another ice tea refill.  Boy what a mistake that was, the desert was terrible and she never brought the ice tea.  Needless to say I do not recommend this place. The only reason I think this place gets any business is because it's next to the zoo.  If you want great BBQ and great service then I suggest Bobby Q's we love it there."}
{"text":"Really didn't want to come here, but the girls were down.(their visitation with their parents were cancelled) So I thought sitting by the aquarium might brighten their day? 
So we arrived there around 5:00pm, not that many people there yet. We were able to sit by the shark tank, and the kids were in awe. I ordered the half rack of pork ribs. It came with two sides, i had the fries, and potato salad. Wife had the chicken club salad. The kids was OK with their chicken strips and cheese burger, but they were to involved with the tank. 
I personally was not that impressed with the food that night. Paying $20 for a half slab of ribs, you would think there would be more meat on the ribs? Again, another place with ribs you have to fight with? Very dry, not much flavor, and did I mentioned there were no meat on the ribs. The potato salad was awe full, not what I expected! I even tried the wife's salad. Not impressed at all. Our service wasn't that great, wife ordered the salad and received and sandwich. And our server seemed to have trouble keeping up with her tables.
When we first moved here four years ago. Dillon's Grand was our favorite place to eat. Since they moved, they have just kept on falling down on our list. To the point we might not visit Dillon's anymore. The quality of their food has really gone down, to bad! I love BBQ, but I might have to go east bound for that now."}
{"text":"Car club had a pre-wildlife zoo lunch at Dillon's today. About 20 of us descended on the eatery.  Not a problem as the place is quite large. We had a nice area outside already set up for us. This group is pretty diverse and out of the twenty you will probably not find two that are ordering the same items for lunch and today was no different. I decided on the \"award winning\" onion rings and a bowl of Arizona chili. Those around me had brisket, turkey sandwiches, burgers, etc. My onion rings were really good and did seem to be award winning, the chili although a rather shallow \"bowl\" was good but could have been a lot more spicy for my taste. All others finished every bite of their food and thoroughly enjoyed it. Rarely does a place this size serve quality food, but Dillon's did that very well. The wait staff were very friendly and did exceedingly well for a group of 20 where there were probably 12 different checks, both couples and singles. Efficiently they handled this, too bad the TIP was included in the price on the receipt, I would have given another 10% for the service. So, if you are going to the Zoo, stop by, if you are in the neighborhood and are hungry, stop by.  The menu is quite extensive, something for everyone."}
{"text":"We love coming here when we come to this zoo. Always good food and great service. The toddler can sit for hours in front of the shark tank."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this restaurant 3 stars for their service. The food was very good., though. We sat in the bar area and it took a good 10 minutes to get acknowledged. We gave our drink orders and another wait. My Bloody Mary was just ok, pretty watered down.  We had to ask for waters, ask for utensils...which I ended up getting myself. We ordered two orders of onion rings, which came out quickly. These were fantastic, light, not greasy, great batter. I loved them!  The entrees we ordered took so long to get. I don't know why they can't get their service together. The salmon BLT I ordered was very good and worth the wait.  The salmon was perfectly cooked, moist and tender.  I would recommend dining here over the zoo's eatery, but just plan on slow service."}
{"text":"Great food, great service!  The BBQ beans and the potato salad are incredible!  The pulled pork is the best.   BRAXTON (the manager), was just a total professionally and a super nice guy, making sure everything was all good.  I'll certainly be back.  THANK YOU BRAXTON, your professionalism is fantastic.  Your employees were also just super!!  
A great place to have BBQ and watching the sharks is pretty cool!"}
{"text":"As a frequent guest, can't say this was a good experience.. (hopefully this was a bad time/bad server situation) came into Dillions this Sunday and was served by Katrina. After being seated which was super quick, we waited about 10 minutes for Katrina to get our drink order, another 10 minutes to get the drinks, then 15 minutes to get our order in after asking her while walking by, once our order was taken we waited 40 minutes for a salad, catfish platter, and a sausage plate. The food was okay, the salad ordered was missing the ham that comes in it.. As far as the taste goes, it was clear the kitchen staff was having an off day. Very disappointing! We'll be back but not any time soon."}
{"text":"This is a unique value proposition.  The aquarium is fantastic but criminally underutilized in relation to the dining experience, which is average at best.  The merely adequate food and beverages lean on the aquarium....maybe best for groups with kids or a compromise choice for a large family type group."}
{"text":"Our waitress was great! Tenile, I hope I spelled that correctly. She was awesome, made sure we were taken care of, made us to go cups of sweet tea. 

Our table was great as well, we got to sit near the shark which my daughter LOVED!

The food, onion rings, best I've ever had! They are award winning here at the restaurant. My beef brisket, I've had better, a little on the dry side. Coleslaw, I really liked it! BBQ baked beans, BEST I EVER HAD so far!! Bread and butter, delicious as well, soft bread and the butter was a little sweet and cinnamon. 

Great place, I just wish the brisket was a little better."}
{"text":"Fool me once shame on me fool me over and over ... You lose. I can't believe we have tried to give this restaurant several tries hoping it was just a bad night  but each time we are totally disappointed.  We have had the ribs - blah, dry, small portions,- the sandwiches - hot dog buns what?.. - French fries that come in a vegetable dish omg..salads that are just about as basic as one can imagine..I mean really a taco salad with lettuce , meat, cheese ! That's it no beans, corn, tomatos, Avocado, etc.  Just the most non imaginative food.  The fish ..yike just so boring.  I really wanted this to be good because it's a cool place but really?  Get a chef!
But unlike previous reviews, we have had very good service but sat in the bar perhaps that makes a difference."}
{"text":"Been there a couple times, the first time was really good about 3-4 years ago.  Second time was about a year ago and it just wasn't as good.  They were extremely busy, seating was tight and limited, service was mediocre and so was the food."}
{"text":"Just had a great corn beef dinner for st Patty day.  Love the zoo location and the shark tank in the dining room.  Kelsey the sweetheart was my server.  If you want great service ask for her.  Will be back for great bbq and onion rings in the future thanks."}
{"text":"Don't let the zoo smells a stop you from trying out the restaurant. Decor is under the sea rustic. HUGE tanks of salt water sea life throughout the restaurant. Ask to be seated by one of the tanks. You will be mesmerized by the sharks and rays while you wait for your food. It is always busy so there really isn't a \"good\" time to go. Because it is adjacent to the zoo and has oversized tanks of sea life, it is the place to go for families. Weekends and school breaks seem to stimulate families to get out and spend time together. Waitress was polite and prompt to greet us and take our order but food was slow in arriving. Try their onion rings, they are some of the best I've had, even better than Claim Jumper and those are some really good onion rings. If I am ever in this area again, I would definitely come back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came to the zoo with our daughter and stopped here for lunch. We were sat immediately, service was fast and wonderful, food was good and the prices were fair!"}
{"text":"While I have a long history with this restaurant and have previously enjoyed their food and entertainment, today the ownership decided to throw despicable politics into their business, bragging that over Veteran's Day weekend they will not show any NFL games.  This is ridiculous stand on their part since the NFL player protests have been the furthest thing from disrespect to veterans, instead trying only to bring attention to the horrific cases of police abuse against African Americans and minorities throughout the country.  This theme that they are disrespecting America is one being propagated by the alt right, a group which are the closest thing to an American Nazi party that we've seen in decades.  That's who the veterans that fought to rid us of that hate and fascism should be upset about and many are and are fully supportive of player's 1st amendment rights.  Dillon's has lost my business and I implore all reasonable people to do the same."}
{"text":"As can be expected, Dillon's should never be considered a daytime destination restaurant unless you enjoy being surrounded by dozens of out-of-control animals, and I don't mean the ones behind the bars.  With that being said, it's certainly a nice alternative to the snack bar inside the zoo.  

I opted for the pulled pork sandwich (your choice of sauce) and potato salad.  The pork was good!  I liked that it was topped with sauce and not swimming in it.  I ordered it on the side just to be sure it wasn't too much.  The potato salad was different.  With cheddar cheese, it reminded me of a loaded baked potato concept.

The restaurant was incredibly busy and there was quite a wait for seating, but our server did a great job of making sure we were taken care of."}
{"text":"LOVE the shark tank! How neat is it to watch sharks swim while you eat?! 
As for the service and food; service was pretty good - no complains everyone is super friendly and attentive. I had a pulled pork sandwich and it was pretty good as well, however I have to be honest and say that it wasn't anything to write mom or yelp about, BUT the shark tank IS!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to eat. Close to the highway in case you're leaving or coming into town. Service was good and not a long wait. Drinks are not to die for but good enough. The shark tank is awesome, huge. Kids would have a great time seeing the sharks, albino alligator and other animals  around the tables. We'll definitely go back and take family and friends when they visit."}
{"text":"Would give a few more stars if I could ! Yesterday was our very 1st visit ever and went on a Groupon. Very excellent-friendly-kind-smiley-personable-knowledgeable service from our waitress
 **** Arica! **** The shark tank was awsome. That,  mixed with the lower lighting felt very relaxing. The food was awsome! We had the brisket meal and also BLT. Excellent food and drinks. Prices were very fair with or without that Groupon. We saw several people celebrating Birthdays as well as a large party of at least 20 setting up. Great experience start to finish...we WILL be back!  :)"}
{"text":"Wasn't my families first time at this location and it won't be the last! The view of the shark tank was amazing and the staff was so knowledgeable of the aquatic life. The BBQ was exactly what I expected for a product labeled as KC BBQ! I highly recommend the burnt ends topped with sweet heat BBQ sauce accompanied with mac & cheese! We will return!!!"}
{"text":"Just not very good at all, service was bad, food was bad. Pulled pork meat was bland at best almost tasted boiled, bun was soggy and the sauce tasted like ketchup and the onion rings were do greasy they dripped. Server literally seemed lost and struggled to answer any questions. It's sad too because this could really be an awesome place considering location. I'm guessing they just bank on hungry tired zoo visitors and the fact there really isn't much competition. Next time I'm at the zoo I'll just get a hot dog at one of the snack bars."}
{"text":"This is my first time at the restaurant and it was really good. I enjoyed watching the sharks in the large tank and the stew is absolutely delicious. I will definitely be back for more in the future. 
As for the staff, they did a good job of making sure our visit was a pleasant one.
Overall I would say that this is a nice place to get lunch out with family."}
{"text":"Drink specials are great. Mushrooms and zucchini are yummy. Love watching the sharks and sting rays. Mashed potatoes are probably my favorite. My husband loves the bbq chicken sandwiches. I didn't care too much for the Portobello mushroom sandwich. Yummy desserts too. Overall pricing is good, food is good and entertainment is nice. They have live music... haven't gone yet."}
{"text":"Actually,I would give them  minus 1. We ate dinner there Friday evening. There was 8 of us. Everyone had something different,from a sandwich to combo meals. Food was horrible. We've been there before,and the food was just okay. This bordered on being one of the worst meals I've ever had. Certainly,the worst barbecue ever. I know we will never return."}
{"text":"We really like Dillon's, but will not return to this one. The service was horrible. Waited a very long time for food and drinks. Getting refills was a real chore just to try and find our server. The food was very old and bad. You could tell the macaroni and cheese had been portioned out days before and reheated until it was hard. The food was barely warm. Everything on the menu was very overpriced for the quality and quantity you get. Very small portions are given. The restaurant was very unclean. There was no way to be able to sit outside with the flamingos, because the patio was absolutely filthy. Bird poop, feathers, mud, and 2 inches of dirt on everything. It smelled very bad and tables and chairs everywhere. We opted to sit inside by the shark tank, big mistake. It was very sad, the sharks were so under fed that they were actually, literally eating each other. This place needs to be shut down fast and the animals removed until they know how to properly take care of them. I have never had a bad experience at a Dillon's before, I just don't know if this place gave up or what. It's no wonder they can't get any customers in there."}
{"text":"The BBQ is great at this place. Pulled pork, burnt ends, ribs...etc. It is awesome. The sides though are definitely lacking. My mashed potatoes and gravy and macaroni and cheese looked like they came from a frozen dinner. BUT....the BBQ makes it worth it...just go with the fries to be safe for your side. Also, if its available, sit next to the shark tank. Its really cool."}
{"text":"There was a little weirdness in trying to get seated for our large party but it was all fixed up quickly. Our food was good and the service was nice. I like how you basically HAVE to go to the restaurant after the zoo and I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Deep fried mushrooms here are amazing. $2 onion rings are a great buy! The pulled pork is great! But the prices are high (they are currently offering a groupon of $30 of food for $19).

Be sure to see the Flamingos in the bar and say hello to Fluffy, the albino alligator, while you're there!

When I got the bill for my meal, the suggested tip amounts are including tax. I don't tip on tax and I don't know anyone who does. All tips are based on the value of what the customer ordered. The restaurant collecting tax on behalf of the government should not be calculated as extra money for the server. If the server did a great job, they deserve a tip much larger than that. This practice seems is, in my opinion, deceitful to customers who aren't paying attention or who are just bad at math."}
{"text":"Right about average....

The environment is cool as you can sit in the dining area where the shark tank is from the zoo.  The staff was friendly but slightly slow to get drinks out.  They offered free fresh onion rings if you followed Dillons on FB or Twitter.

I had pulled pork and burnt ends in their sweet and hot sauce.  The burnt ends seemed to simply be little pieces of cut sirloin with bbq sauce.  The pulled pork was pretty good.  Baked beans were also solid.

My GF had the brisket and it was average.  Baked potato was a bit dry.  Her Pina Colada was small and pretty bland as well.

Overall dinner for 4 was $80 with tip.  I feel the food at Famous Dave's honestly is better, which dissapointed me.

Overall it wasn't bad, simply average."}
{"text":"The food was okay but the service was terrible. They weren't busy and we were seated right away. But then we waited to get our order taken and waited some more to finally get our food. Then it was like our waitress disappeared into another dimension.  She was literally walking around the dining room and would walk by our table and act like she had no clue that she was servicing our table. When she finally brought our bill, we sat there while she checked salt shakers and ketchup bottles right near our table and never once came to get our bill. It was so bizarre. Not happy about the experience and won't be back."}
{"text":"I love the shark/sting ray tank (the opposite side of the zoo's aquarium). The kids loved that too. That would be the highlight of this place. The food was average at best. The hostess had no idea what their happy hour consisted of or what hours it was offered. We asked around and finally learned that the Happy Hour wasn't much of a happy hour anyway. One of the BBQ sandwiches we ordered was so soggy that it could not be picked up, so we had to re-order another. It came out fine the 2nd time around. Our 2nd server (not sure what happened to the first) was fantastic. She actually helped turned our experience around, and comped one of the sandwhiches for us. She and the shark tank helped bring the star count up on our night out here."}
{"text":"The food here is ok, we come here when we visit the zoo as the zoo food is crazy expensive. We love eating with the fish and the flamingos. It could be a bit cleaner for me, but it's not gross by any means. They have a lot of traffic and the zoo is all dirt, so I'm sure it's almost impossible to keep it super clean. The key staff that are always there are great, there is a few rotating teen/young staff members that turnover that are not great, but for the most part it's pretty neat to go see the aquarium while you eat."}
{"text":"We came here mainly to see the shark tank with my almost 3 year old son but we were surprised by the great food and service!

It was packed and seemed like a very popular place. Sitting inside with the shark tank was cool, but the outside sitting area was awesome too with a view of a white gator and beautiful pink flamingos.

I got the beef brisket and it was delicious. Make sure to ask for all 3 BBQ sauces so you get to taste all of them. Honestly, they were all delicious!

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great spot to take the family while at the zoo or just to hang at a friendly spot I would recommend to everyone as a place you must try at least once . Great specials available and friendly staff and service. Go check it out"}
{"text":"Very cool place the shark tank was awesome! The food was good we tried the 50/50 ribs the beef were the best. Deff great for kids and adults. The service was awesome!! Not saying it's the best BBQ but the Shark tank gives it that extra excitement. Would deff return."}
{"text":"It was surprisingly good for a BBQ joint in a zoo. The staff was very friendly and the prices were reasonable, considering they have a fairly captive clientele.

I had a briscut sandwich with the \"sweet-tangy\" sauce and the portion was good for lunch. My side was mac n cheese with corn in it, also pretty good. Add in a $2 PBR and lunch is served.

My wife had a chicken salad that was a fairly large portion and she said was pretty good.

We ordered some fries for our toddler and they were shaped like little faces and he seemed to really enjoy them."}
{"text":"Yesterday , during lunch, we were lucky to be seated in Nicole C area by shark tank.  Nicole C is friendly, upbeat and made our meal a pleasant experience.  The pulled pork sandwiches were delicious.  Thank you Nicole for exceptional service"}
{"text":"I have tried and tried to like this place. It is always busy and there is always a wait to be seated in the dining room but I don't get it. We always sit in the bar or patio area and there is no wait. The beer is always terribly warm, the service is always less than friendly, and the food is less than good. The waitresses look like they just got out of bed and went to work. I had the taco salad this last time and I could have done better in my own kitchen. I don't think anyone from this brand even reads these comments. disappointing because I want to like the place...."}
{"text":"I love this place. The burnt ends and St. Louis ribs were delicious. I got the meal that was pick 2 meats and 2 sides for $20. I gave the sides to my daughter so it worked out perfect for us. The service was ok. It didn't stand out as great or bad. Pretty average. But the huge shark tank is very impressive. And you can go out to the patio and see all the flamingos and other birds. I think this place is great for families, couples, groups, friends. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"On our way home from the White Tank Regional Park, we stopped by Dillon's KC BBQ to pick up food to go. We called to place our order before we left the park, and the food was ready when we arrived. 

The woman on the phone was very helpful. We had three people ordering pork ribs with different sauces, sides and drinks. The ribs are prepared with a rub which might be a problem for those on a no/low sodium diet. My dad tried to get the ribs without the rub, and had to forego the ribs entirely because the waitstaff said no \"rub\" was not an option. She was courteous and repeated the overwhelming offerings when we asked. Best yet, she got our order right. 

The parking lot is huge! Be sure to park by the restaurant door and not the wildlife zoo door; otherwise you'll have a long walk. It would have been fun to eat here to enjoy the wildlife viewing after dining, but we had our dog and couldn't leave her in the car. Unfortunately they don't allow dogs on the patio either. 

The ribs were finger licking good. The corn on the cob is boiled not grilled, so each morsel is very plump and juicy. The steak fries were cold by the time we got home. Definitely not a good item to order to go. My mom was smart and got the baked potato instead. It was wrapped in cellophane so it stayed warm. 

I certainly would consider ordering the ribs again. They were tender, and I really enjoyed the \"sweet with heat\" sauce."}
{"text":"Second time eating here. The first time I wasn't impressed. This time they sat me and my son in a corner next to a larger family. Not the best spot in the place. They should consider morning that table. Regarding the food, it was decent. I wouldn't write home about it."}
{"text":"Actually quite good for a place that is by the zoo.  I had the az turkey sandwich. The sauces are pretty good   the sweet hot I'd very good.   It has a good flavor and the heat sneaks up on you.   Have  a try at this place   you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and twice I've gotten sick. I thought maybe the first time was a fluke... nope! I'm giving it two stars because my son loves the tanks and the other animals. And we took some cute pics at the photo booth."}
{"text":"This place is soooo good and has amazing food for amazing prices :-) we were extremely impressed with lunch here while at the wildlife zoo! Will be back very soon and looking forward to sitting next to the sharks again!"}
{"text":"I have been to all but 1 Dillon's location and they are all good establishments. This one was unique and fun to say the least. We asked to be seated near the shark tank and I really enjoyed watching the sharks while I ate my meal. Despite being in a zoo it does not smell bad inside. The bar seating area has a patio with flamingos to watch. The food stays consistent at the Dillon's locations and is always tasty. I got grilled wild cod with potatoes and gravy and cottage cheese. All of the meals came with a side biscuit and their delicious cinnamon butter. My husband got the prime rib with Mac and cheese and potatoes and the prime rib had a delicious camp fire wood smoked taste to it. My daughter got the appetizer taquitos. Overall the food was good as usual. We only saw our waiter once after our meal was served as he was busy preparing a table for a large party coming in."}
{"text":"First I'd like to mention that this was my second time at Dillons, the first being at their Thunderbird location. So I decided to take my date to this location because I liked how it was intergrated into the zoo. Before going to this restaurant we read all the previous reviews--many of them being negative, but I still decided we should go. EPIC FAIL!!! The service was slow & our waitor was nice but you could tell he didn't take pride in his job very much. I ordered to two meat platter (burnt ends & turkey) and was certain I wanted the burnt ends but couldn't decide on my second meat so I asked my waitor what was the best choice & he says \"by far it's the turkey, the turkey's one of the best meats we have. It's my favorite.\" So I ordered the turkey with my burnt ends & fries & mac & cheese on the side. We waited forever for our food to come. However, I must add the fried mushrooms I had as an appetizer were AMAZING!!! So the food finally comes and everything was cold except the fries. The turkey was beyond HORRIBLE; it was nothing but thick slices of bbq'd sandwich meat & tasted like it was soaked in lighter fluid. The burnt ends were ok, just not very fresh & cold. I knew what to expect from their mac & cheese, just average and you can't go wrong with basic steak fries. After letting the waitor know how I felt about the turkey he offered to replace it so I chose the chicken. So my date decided she was \"over it\" and before I could cancel the chicken to just pay for what we weren't displeased with the waitor comes with the chicken literally about one or two minutes later. The chicken was piping hot & you could tell it had been microwaved & had that same lighter fluid taste. At that point we just left our food, all half eaten & paid then left. The best part of the whole experience was getting to sit next to the alligator enclosure. If you choose to go this restaurant you'll be paying for the experience more than anything. NEVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to one other location of this local chain and liked it so when a friend and I went to the aquarium we planned on eating here. Friday night and the place was packed but we got seated right away. We even got a table right next to the shark tank! After our drinks came things slowed up a bit and it was a while before our orders were taken and almost forever before we got our food. I got a full rack of St Louis style ribs knowing I would have enough for leftovers and they were decent, a touch on the overdone side.  I got corn and macaroni and cheese as my sides and they were both good."}
{"text":"The grandkids love coming here. We sit in the restaurant and watch the rays and sharks swim in the huge aquarium. The food is excellent, with the kids loving the mac n cheese."}
{"text":"It's at a zoo. Better than average, but nothing great. Overpriced, and really busy. But what do you expect at a zoo?"}
{"text":"Fast forward 6 years and we are here again for our anniversary.  We have been back here numerous times and have always had a good experience.  Once again the food was delicious and this time we all ordered BBQ.  I did make a reservation for our large party and it was confirmed by them earlier that morning.  Although the hostess did not have the reservation marked, we were seated promptly.  It was just annoying to have her ask other employees about the reservation while we were standing there."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this restaurant. Said it was really cool inside and there was a shark tank inside.  I was thinking Rain Forest Cafe Style aquariums around the room at best.  The 'tank' was a full sized aquarium with many sharks to view. We were lucky enough to be there when two guys dropped in to check the tank and clean the inside glass. It was really cool.  The food was good, loved the wings. Spicy teriyaki wings were hot, but you couldn't stop eating them.  The drink menu has a large variety.  Oh, and the bar area was cool too. You get a glimpse of a couple aquarium exhibits including the Albino Crocodile. I want to go back to sit in the bar.  Staff were helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"I had the two meat combo. As a rule I order brisket at any bbq place I go to for the first time. I feel like brisket will tell the tale. It was dry, over trimmed, and served with sauce that could not have been more mediocre. My wife had the Carolina pulled pork sandwich, also not good. 

The service was good but the prices are high and the food isn't good."}
{"text":"Food was good and the service was excellent. Where else can you eat with sharks swimming by? The pulled pork was great, was a little disappointed they did not have burnt ends that day."}
{"text":"We always go here really this time the DirecTV is out and it's because of the heat DirecTV told him so we have nothing to watch in the bar so we decided to leave the manager tries to give us free onion rings which we love their onion rings but we say no we have to go if I was the owner of this place I'd be calling DirecTV and saying dish is on their way to switch out all your stuff unless u get mine working they say it's been going on for a week because of the heat really nobody else's goes out lost a s now......now we know why there are only 6 people in the bar on a Saturday night"}
{"text":"Sweet Heat BBQ sauce, my taste buds heart belong to you & so do these 3 stars!

This is an adult restaurant in a zoo,,,, the combination is confusing & at times, slightly scary, lol.
 
The shark tanks are not huge & are blocked by tables, so don't come here to view the sharks. They are actually the same tanks that are in the Aquarium that is adjacent. You can get a much better view from there. 

What you will see LOTS of are loud, wild children, basking in their natural habitat, accompanied by tired parents with blank stares who have been conditioned only to smell blood & the sound of cracking bones.... unless CPR is necessary, they will not be phased. 

The wait staff tries hard to keep everything running smoothly. I was helped by 5 different people, including my waiter. They work quickly, efficiently & seem to try not to notice chaos that is surrounding them. If you want to get their attention you have to do something strange that warrants their attention.... so basically, sit quietly, very still & they will think something is wrong & head right over :) 

The food was good, especially the pulled pork sandwich, but hard to enjoy fully due to the environment. The zoo itself is a lot more peaceful, lol."}
{"text":"We took a late lunch at Dillon's while we were visiting the attached zoo / aquarium.  Luckily, we did not experience the service problems that other reviewers experienced. Our waitress was very nice and attentive.  The food was good - I had the Pulled Pork sandwich and he had the Sausage Plate (pictures to come). I enjoyed the mild sauce and he really liked the sweet-heat.  The Mac and Cheese was my favorite side, but the fries weren't bad!

There were definitely little ones running around, and since we were close to the tank they passed by use relatively frequently.  This didn't really bother us since the restaurant is attached to the zoo, so we expected to see a lot of kids and that they would be energetic in that environment.

We didn't get a dessert since we were both pretty full after the meal so I can't speak to any of those, but they sounded tasty!

Overall: B+
The outside will be noisy since it's right next to the flamingo exhibit and at the entrance to the zoo (we sat inside to avoid some heat / noise).  The food was good, both the mild sauce and sweet-heat were a hit for us!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch while visiting the zoo.  Service was a bit slow, but there were tons of people.  The food prices justified the portions.  Onion rings were great $3, Bloody Mary's were $4, and my BBQ combo was $20.  Well worth it."}
{"text":"Food and service was very good. Even though it was a busy Friday night, we were seated right away and drink order was taken. The food came out hot and well prepared. We had Victor as our server and he gave us great recommendations. The Smoked Beef Stew is outstanding. I will order that every time. Loved the shark aquarium and am looking forward to bringing the grandkids the next time they are in town. I will definitely return and try out the cobbler. My husband and son enjoyed the beef brisket and rib combo. The mashed potatoes and cream gravy...oh my! Delicious. Ribs fell off the bone and the sauces were terrific. If you are looking for good solid food, really good customer service, and dining with sharks...give Dillion's a chance."}
{"text":"Service was awesome. I wanted to try all three sauces and the server even brought our a few fresh French fries to dip in them. I got the red devil sandwich which was super yummy but spicy. On a scale of 1-10 it was a hot damn! Glad I had the cole slaw to cool it down. Really fun sitting in the room with the huge shark tank. Going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere especially if you have children in your party. The amazing shark tank is a great addition to the good food. I've had the brisket sandwich, the catfish, the burger, and the chicken club and they are all great here. They usually have good attentive service and the prices are good (about $10-$12 per plate). We will continue to be repeat customers!"}
{"text":"Brisket sandwich was decent. The sweet heat sauce has quite a bit of kick to it. Mashed potatoes were delish. My only problem  was we chose to sit it the outdoorish area overlooking the flamingos and a couple of bees got in. I am terrified of bees, so me and a kid from a neighboring table got up and were  running around the dining area freaking out. It was like a horror movie. If I ever go back I'm Def sitting inside where the worst that can happen is the shark tank will explode on us."}
{"text":"Food was ok, they put some gross add ons like corn in mac and cheese yuck. I like both but don't mix em! Good location I mean if ur at the zoo I don't know where else u are going to eat. Good views of shark tank and flamingos."}
{"text":"Tessie (Tessy?) was our server, and she pretty much ignored us, Fun.

The onion rings were good, a light crispy batter with thinly cut onion. Nice.

The Pulled Pork Sandwiches were pretty unexciting. Mine was on the dry side, and my dining partner says that she did not get enough sauce. Further, yjr Sweet Heat sauce doesn't have a lot of flavor, only heat. 

Their Mac n Cheese had corn in it. Don't get me wrong, I like corn, but I do not eat GMO corn and not telling me that corn is in a dish is not cool."}
{"text":"Food prices are reasonable and cool environment inside the restaurant watching sharks swimming by while we were eating. Long Island Iced tea drink is 2nd best offered by this restaurant and 1st best drink at Black Angus restaurant. I will go back with my new date in near future."}
{"text":"The onion rings are delicious.  The rest of the food that we ordered was pretty boring.  I wish the menu had some more fresh options. The inside could use some updating.  Our table had a ripped and worn plastic table covering, it was not well maintained.  My kids love the flamingos, that was our favorite part."}
{"text":"Had lunch during a break from walking the zoo. Service and food was very good. Pulled pork is always good as are the beans, mashed potatoes with white gravy. Macaroni and cheese was just ok though. We have never had a bad meal at Dillons. Onion rings are a must have!"}
{"text":"Good bbq turkey, good service a good fun view of the aquarium. Not busy, no waiting. A little pricey but good portions"}
{"text":"I really don't understand some of the heavy-handed reviews for this location.  No, it's not the \"Best Barbecue I've ever had\", and who goes to a barbecue place and orders a taco salad or fish? Also, trying to circumvent the coupon policies by splitting checks then complaining just shows cheapness. Granted, restaurants should stick to what they are good at and make everything equally well, however, it sounds like if one goes in with unreal expectations anyplace will fail to meet those standards. 

We've had good luck at this location. The food and service have never been 5-Star but if I could give 3 1/2 stars I would. The ambiance in the shark tank is festive, usually with kids (and adults) looking with wonder but kids will be kids so don't expect a quiet, intimate date night. Don't go to Disneyland and complain because there are kids around. The food is generally really good and the portions substantial. Barbecue is infinitely subjective, if you find 10 people who like barbecue you will find 10 opinions as to how it should be prepared. 

I find a lot of reviews are people who just like to complain. Reviewing means being objective, and not taking circumstances personal. I can't believe how many reviews complain someone \"gave me a dirty look\" or \"deliberately ignored us\", tell me, what grade are you in?  Before you take a reviewer's word on a place look at his past reviews. If all of his reviews are 1-star maybe they are the common denominator."}
{"text":"Such a nice place to eat and we make it a point to always have lunch or dinner here anytime we visit the zoo/aquarium.  The service is great, the food is great....everything we have tried here has been perfect.  It has nice seating options of sitting outside or inside with a view of the shark tank...it's a very relaxing atmosphere and have been going for years, the whole menu is great no matter what you order, it's good.  One of my favorite places to eat in AZ."}
{"text":"Tried this place on 5/27/17

1. The waiter dumped an entire plate all over my daughter- they didn't offer any discount, their only response was well at least she's wearing a black shirt!!!

2. We are from Kansas City, we know good BBQ!! This is by NO MEANS good BBQ!!! Absolutely the worst BBQ I've EVER!! Eaten anywhere!!!! Worst food I've been served in a restaurant anywhere!!! Makes a McRib look like fine dining!!!

No Flavor at all!!! I ordered the build your own combo-brisket, burnt ends, smoked sausage. I ate 1 piece of brisket, 2 bites of sausage, and 2 bites of burnt ends.  All I could stomach!!

I knew it was going to be bad when the waitress refilled my drink and said \"they're putting yours in now, it shouldn't be long\".  Fresh BBQ would be kept in a warmer, guessing this was being put in the microwave!

Looked and tasted like processed meat!! Absolutely no smoke ring on the brisket. 

For Gods sake they serve it with a steak knife!!! BBQ should fall apart and melt in your mouth!!!

I'm sure they will contact me trying to get me to remove this review, nothing you could offer would make me want to eat here again, my house plumbing would never forgive me!!!

I finally had to walk out as my wife just wanted us to pay and leave as soon as possible!! I walked out, she paid the bill- even with the groupon I feel ripped off!!!!

Shark tank was ok.

Mushrooms were decent

This is the best I can say."}
{"text":"Great location and good business for the zoo and aquarium, but this place was waaaaaay understaffed.  It was packed for lunch and even in the bar area only 2 servers. Food was decent, Bloody Eddy was the best part of my meal :)"}
{"text":"*WARNING* The food was ok the place was just dirty. While my family ordered I watched two tables not get cleaned for 30 min and when the buser finally came to clean the tables he just pulled a rag out his pocket and wiped the food on the floor! Yuck! Can you say health violation. Even though the zoo was awesome I will not eat at this Dillion's again two waiters dropped orders to make matters worse. *warning*"}
{"text":"Dinner by the shark tank is super cool. Onion rings are very good.  The zoo part was a little too spendy $34 but the restaurant is neat."}
{"text":"If we are at the zoo or looking for good BBQ...can't go wrong with this place.  My kids love sitting near the fish tank.  Service is always average never amazing.  But the good each and every time is fantastic.  The pulled pork, onion rings, apple cobbler are all amazing."}
{"text":"I confess that I am not a huge smoked meat fan. This menu is full of offerings for BBQ lovers. I had the beef brisket platter. It was a generous serving of tender meat. Staff were nice. Neat to have views of flamingos from the bar and large shark and sting ray aquarium in dining area. Added bonus was a good acoustical guitar player in bar. They are the only restaurant/bar in this area. I would return."}
{"text":"We went on Valentine's Day which you would have thought meant they had their A Game on but it did not seem like that. We waited for 35 minutes to get a table and then another 15 minutes to see our waitress which was cranky and annoyed that we were in her section. The live band was great and the food was good but we never were able to order more food or drinks because we never saw our waitress again."}
{"text":"Today was not our first day at Dillon's, but it sure was our last!  Today we went in while visiting the zoo as the kiddos were hungry.  1/2 the shark tank room and 1/2 of the outside seating is empty. There are 4 \"hostesses\" doing absolutely nothing!  We stood there waiting forever.  People are now coming in from the main entrance and getting seated before us!  Then I was told I could go sit at the bar (not in the bar area, but at the bar)... keep in mind I have a 2 & 5 year old with me.... I don't think so!  Needless to say, we left and went elsewhere for our lunch today. 

From previous experiences at this location:

Customer service... what customer service, would have been served faster & better by trained monkeys!  To make it worse, it was a \"manager\" who was serving us last time and what should of taken 30-45 minutes, took over 2 hours and it was the bus boy who took better care of us!  Give that kid a raise and a promotion to manager! 

Food.... edible, but nothing special, definately not worth the money!

If you want good BBQ, go to Charleston's at Scottsdale Road & Frank Lloyde Wright!  That is where we are going!  Now they have great service & awesome food!"}
{"text":"We love Dillon's!  I mentioned this to a friend and she said 'you like their BBQ?  Clearly we have different tastes' well, duh.  I'm sure some people aren't going to like it but we sure do!  First of all, it is convenient.  We go to the zoo often and eating at Dillion's is a highlight.  Kids love the shark tank, but my favorite place to sit is on the patio.  It smells a little stinky sometimes (thanks to the flamingos) but it's worth it!  We are usually there for lunch but recently had dinner on the patio and had the most gorgeous sunset view, complete with palm trees and flamingos!  

And the food is good.  I always get the brisket sandwich with sweet heat sauce and it hasn't disappointed me once!  My hubby likes the pulled pork (all varieties) sandwich.  He recently ordered the ribs and didn't like them quite as much.  If you like onion rings order at least one or 2 orders.  Only $2 each and delicious!  Great prices here in general.  Awesome to have this dining option.  I would always choose to eat here instead of forking out money for a hotdog at one of the snack shops.

We love it!"}
{"text":"Another family favorite. We enjoy stopping by every now again for cold beer, onion rings and BBQ!"}
{"text":"First time here. Place is pretty dark. Only thing cool is shark tank. The food is overpriced for BBQ and there's nothing spectacular about it. My brisket sandwich was super dry it was like having BBQ out of the frozen food section. 


Keli reached out to me and said they are working on their vendor for their brisket meat and sent me a gift card to go back and try the food again. Thanks Keli"}
{"text":"Not sure why all the hate but I came here and had a great meal with great service. I've been to many Dillion locations and their food is pretty consistent. I wouldn't say it's the best BBQ but definitely pretty darn good. Wife ordered BBQ pulled pork and it was very good. I ordered fish tacos and they were also pretty good. My mashed and BBQ baked bean sides were awesome (yeah I ordered that with tacos , ha ha). I would have gave them a 4 star but all the lame reviews for ppl that said it wasn't the best and gave a 1 star.  Request to sit next to the huge shark tank.... It's a real treat.  Also, just be grateful that there is a very good consistent restaurant in the middle of no where folks!  If this isn't good enough for you go ahead and drive another hour to your favorite BBQ place you idiot!"}
{"text":"Good place for some Kansas City BBQ. Noise level was a little loud but it's connected to a zoo so you will get your share of kids. Not nearly as loud as other reviews made it out to be. Recommend coming later if you don't want many kids around. Food prices were a little high though. I have had a lot of BBQ from various cities and I have had better for the price. Overall its still a good place to eat with friendly service."}
{"text":"Too expensive for what you get. I'm vegetarian so of course not many choices at a BBQ restaurant but the vegetarian enchiladas where spinach dip wrapped in a tortilla  Kids wouldn't even finish their food....which after waking around to zoo for hours they were starving. Restaurant definitely needs a facelift, only highlight was watching the sharks and fish in the aquarium."}
{"text":"Family made an order for pick up. Told when I walked in the door that I had to go to the take out counter to get it. Which was 2 feet away. Asked if there was anyone that can help me, two girls said you have to wait for the take out girl. They stood there 2 feet from me for 20 minutes along with a bartender walking by and waitresses.  They had a whopping 8 people in the whole place and no one would help me. Finally I was told I was waiting because the take out girl had a bloody nose. I can't make this up. 5 minute later one of the girls 2 feet away walked behind the counter I had been standing at and said maybe this is yours. Handed it to me and said it was paid for and sorry for the wait. I left and then my mother in law got 4 calls saying someone came in and took the order without paying. Called manager and explained situation, I was told it was paid for as well as all of the ridiculous lack of service . I paid him over the phone by CC as he said sorry about the girl with the bloody nose etc. But I can't even discount this because it was a catering order.  My mother in law ordered two racks of ribs. What a joke.  Absolutely horrendous representation."}
{"text":"Back again for DJ Trivia. 

The five stars is for the food and service. Even though the bar area was packed, the servers and bartender were extremely efficient, friendly, and professional. The \"naked\" crispy wings were absolutely fantastic - very meaty and fried to perfection! My friends said that their salads were the best they'd had in quite a while. This was a much better experience than my last time here. 

On the other hand, I would give the trivia DJ one star, if that. He constantly \"played\" his comments and inside jokes to the table of his buddies, who were loud (calling out supposedly funny wrong answers, to which the DJ would respond, therefore encouraging them to make more comments), and they couldn't seem to stay seated, thus blocking the screens from the views of many of us. If the DJ wants to behave like that, he should take his \"show\" and his buddies to his house and play the game there."}
{"text":"Gotta say I was not impressed. The hubs is a fan of Dillon's in general and enjoyed his meal, but I thought our appetizer (mushrooms), kids meals and my meal were bland and no better than a bad TGI Fridays. And they say the kids meals come with fries, but they actually come with some kind of nasty mashed-potatoes-reformed-into-deep-fried-patties-with-smiley-faces. Yuck. Talk about processed. Everything, except the hubs chicken sandwich, tasted like cheap frozen food or microwaved food."}
{"text":"It was ok. My husband ordered the beef ribs the portion was huge but unfortunately it was pretty tough.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and that was good.  Our server was very friendly."}
{"text":"The service at Dillons has definitely taken a turn for the worse over the last year. The last time we went to Dillons my food was inedible and didn't taste the way it normally does (I got the turkey dinner) I did talk to the manager and he did remove it from the bill and offered me a free meal next time, which was nice and appreciated. 

This time (today) our server was pleasant enough but myself and the BF were halfway through our meals before the little ones even arrived (it was grilled cheese and fries) when it did finally arrive we expressed our frustration at how it is hard to keep a toddler occupied sometimes when waiting for food (even with the awesome shark tank right next to us). When the bill came we were discouraged to not see any deduction or bill adjustment for the wait on his meal. 

We will keep eating at Dillons but I'd like to see the service back up to where it was before."}
{"text":"You've GOT to try the ribs!!! That's what my parents kept telling me when we sat down.

For a restaurant located at a Zoo, this place has the market on KC BBQ in Arizona.

Their menu is huge, the portions are huge and the prices are about average.

I personally ordered the taco salad (because of the shell) and my parents both ordered the full rack of ribs, cajun style. They don't eat a lot and both managed to finish their ribs in one sitting. I helped by eating two, but really that didn't do a whole lot.

Both were served with your choice of two sides and a roll and both were FANTASTIC!

I would HIGHLY recommend both the restaurant & the Zoo. Best ever!"}
{"text":"After spending a lovely day at the World Wildlife Zoo, we were feeling hungry for dinner and headed over to Dillon's for some homestyle eats and bbq.  It was a litle busy when we were here around 5 P.M., with a minor wait to get seated (5-10 minutes).  

I ordered the burnt ends plate, with coleslaw and mac & cheese for sides.  The meat was delicious.  It was a good mix of tender and crisp, and the cajun bbq sauce I had it with meshed well with the flavor of the meat.  The mac and cheese was nice and creamy, with pieces of corn kernels for added texture, and browned breadcrumbs on top.  I wasn't a fan of the coleslaw.  I could only taste raw cabbage and not much else in terms of flavor, but my husband really liked it because he said it had a light flavor that he found refreshing (Hey, to each their own!).  

We were seated close to the shark tank, and it was cool seeing the sharks and fish swim around while we waited for our meals.  The meals themselves didn't take too long to be served, and for the most part service was good.  Towards the end of our meal, when it was time to get our check, service came to a halt and we waited a long time for our credit card to be processed so we could leave.  

So, if you are at the zoo and are looking for a decent sit-down restaurant, this is a good option, especially since there doesn't seem to be a lot of places to eat at around this area.  Due to the slow-down in service towards the busier part of the evening though, I might be hesitant to go here again if it's a busy time for the restaurant."}
{"text":"Loved it! We went for a special night out and it was wonderful. We had a fabulous waitress. The food was fantastic, (We got the 3 meat platter, burnt ends rock!) Thoroughly enjoyed the night. A month later we took the kids for two birthdays.. costly night, but the kids loved it! We were able to get right by the shark tank which thoroughly entertained the kids (all 6 of them 9-17 years old) Food went over well with everyone, but... get there early before they run out of burn ends :o( We learned the hard way. My only gripe, they never have any coupon or specials or we would visit more often! Funny enough both trips were FOR Dillons, we never even went to the zoo! We will be back :o)"}
{"text":"One of the most terrible restaurant experiences I've had from start to finish.  To complain about the service would imply there had been some.  We stopped by a bit before they opened.  They looked at us talked to each other then when we walked up told us they were not yet opened.  How about if you're not open, let me know when I walk in, or keep the door locked.

We left and returned a few minutes later when they were open.  There was no hostess at the table, but there was a manager and 3 waitresses too busy talking to seat us.  About 3 or 4 minutes later the manager finally told a waitress to seat us.  The food is frozen, the best thing I can say for it is that it's warm.  The soup of the day was a \"broccoli cheddar\" it was pretty much Velveeta with raw broccoli dropped in.  Like the old place that was in this spot, the best aspect is the fish tank in the restaurant, now it's not even worth that.  This will be our final trip to both this zoo (which I'll review shortly) and this restaurant."}
{"text":"Greasy but tasty. 

This is not the place to go if you're looking for a healthy meal. However, their BBQ sauce is delicious. The smoked turkey is amazing! The burger is pretty darn good too. I'd pass on the vegetable of the day next time, as that was my attempt to make my meal a little bit healthier but they were smothered in oil. The Kids sundae was a tasty treat, but the. Again how can you really do that wrong. 

If you're at the Wild Animal Park, there's basically no better option for food."}
{"text":"As a \"regular\" at this Dillon's location, I've seen busy days and evenings before, but today was unbelievably busy!  Between snowbirds, spring training visitors, and spring breaks at local schools, it was packed.  

What impressed me was the team work I saw going on between all the staff members, from the bartender, to servers, to runners/busboys, and even the manager filling in wherever needed.  Keep in mind that you have a regular restaurant that is attached to the Wildlife World Zoo, in addition to patrons just coming by for lunch.  

If anything isn't just right with your order, they will make it right.  All you have to do is let them know.  

My clam chowder was especially tasty, with lots of clams and not too many potatoes.  They also have my husband's favorite veggie burger.  It's not like any of the veggie patties I've seen in other restaurants.  This one is thick and tasty.

Kudos especially to bartender Linda, server Sammy, and manager Carl today.... moving faster than the speed of light trying to keep up!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing.  We chose to sit outside and it was a great setting.  Would have loved a more multicultural a crowd but you can't have everything.  Service was great, friendly and fast.  Great place"}
{"text":"EAT THE ONION RINGS!!! They are amazing and only $2!!! The bbq here is decent, I have been here a few times and usually get the pulled pork sandwich, standard bbq meal. I'd give the bbq 6of10 but the great service and GIANT shark tank bring it up to an 8of10. I took a group of 25 last night and they handled a large group very well; we all ate and paid in a little over an hour. The manager Carl is extremely nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"-SERVICE: Slow, terrible, and had to clear away our own dirty plates! Food Server seemed very inexperienced. They seem like they hire just \"pretty\" people with lack of customer service or any people skills, plus raunchy appearance.

-AMBIENCE: Very loud! Kids running around! Kids that wedged themselves in between my table and the shark tank (ATTN PARENTS: watch your kids OR leave them at home OR take them to CHUCK E. CHEESE instead!!!)

-FOOD: Room temperature meat, why wasn't it temperature HOT? Overall taste was ok, not the BEST BBQ. Potato salad was good, but was mostly mouthfuls of raw ONIONS than potatoes! (Mints anyone?)

-PORTION: Good

-RESTROOMS: Clean

-PARKING: Plentiful

-BAR: Go outside the bar area to see the flamingos.

-SUMMARY: Very disappointed in the average food and poor service. I would NOT eat here again."}
{"text":"If you're gonna sell Burnt Ends you shouldn't serve chopped brisket. There is a distinct difference. Brisket wasn't bad. Highlight was the southwest Mac n cheese."}
{"text":"This is the best bbq in Maricopa County! The meats are moist and tender, the beans have a great smoky slightly spicy taste, the baked potatoes are flavorful, tender and hot and their hand breaded gigantic onion rings are a signature side you HAVE to try. You won't go wrong here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Good food and great location at the zoo. Price is good as well try the cod it's on point"}
{"text":"So let me tell you my Dillon's story. I went to another location for Dillons in the valley. The experience was so-so at best. Food was average, service was meh, and it was all in all not memorable. 

My family and I went to the Wildlife World Zoo and hung out for the day, at the end of our day we were hungry and they had happy hour (what can I say..Im a sap for Happy Hours).

We had 3 options, By the Alligator, By the Flamingos or By the Sharks.
We chose by the Sharks.

It is a really cool room with a gigantic tank with sharks in it, and the room has mirrors everywhere so you can see the sharks no matter where you sit. (Get your mind out of the gutter....this isn't the Imperial Palace rooms with Mirrors on the ceilings...)

The food was good not 5 star but good. 
I had the burnt ends (of brisket)...FYI Cajun BBQ Sauce..DO IT.
The Onion Rings were good.
The beer and wine were cold and the mac in cheese was nummy.

The service we had was impeccable, and if you don't want to be around kids....you probably shouldn't go to a restaurant that is attached to a zoo...just SAYING. But we didn't have issues with kids running around everywhere but that is luck of the draw wherever you go that has kids and parents.

All in all I will gladly come back here when I go to the WWZ again. I enjoyed myself thoroughly."}
{"text":"Love the shark tank view! Wings were okay but they werent crispy and they were drowned in sauce. The babyback ribs were overcooked and not very juicy.. the pulled pork was good though and the mashed potatoes were AMAZING the butter for the bread was great too. You're looking at $15pp for lunch. Over just okay bbq food but if you're a zoo goer this definitely beats any other food offered there!"}
{"text":"This one is a tuff review for me cause our visit was unremarkable,  nothing with the food wowed me.  it was just basic every day food.   I will say they had no green veggies for side on the day we came,  I know one might say does it matter with the type of food, well if I eat heavy BBQ I still like green veggies with my meal.    Our server was efficient, but mechanical. Prices where a little on the high side but could be expected for the type of venue.  The large fish tank was the coolest thing about the visit.   cant say I wouldn't go back but cant say it would be first on my list."}
{"text":"Great server: Kate, was fun & friendly.  Just had nachos and beer.  Relaxed atmosphere & eat with the animals.  Nice family lunch"}
{"text":"Great place and great environment. The BBQ is delicious and staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Great location as it's right on the World Wildlife Zoo's property. The food isn't the best but it's decent. They confuse their customers by displaying a big banner that reads \"Free Beer\" but in reality it's free Wifi. Wifi is in really small font and the Beer follows the tiny font of \"Cold.\" They have outside seating and cool views of the aquarium."}
{"text":"If you're out here in the far, FAR west side and the smell of wood smoke turning meats into tasty morsels for your enjoyment makes you smile, then you can't pass up Dillon's. You get good value at any Dillon's but this one especially.

It's a little over-priced but the portions are very large and where else in metro PHX are you gonna dine in front of a HUGE aquarium full of sharks and stingrays? Also, there were tablets on each table to keep everyone occupied if the views of the sea creatures weren't enough.

My server- Carly- was excellent. She handled everything with a gorgeous smile and with ease and I'd go back just to sit in her section again. She was wrangling  the other tables' kids dropping crayons and refilling drinks like it was no big deal. 

After a hot day walking around the zoo, it's nice to be able to sit down at Dillon's, get a cold one and some smoked KC style barbecue so don't miss it."}
{"text":"A bit of a let down.  Other than being able to see the sharks swim by in the tank, the food was only fair (ribs were dry and over cooked).  The atmosphere feels more like a cheap diner than a nice \"dining experience\" type of place.  Wouldn't bother going back."}
{"text":"Who the hell can go to THIS location of Dillon's and give LESS than FIVE STARS?? Okay, if you have a problem, I can understand four stars, but the shark tank alone is worth TEN STARS! The food is GOOD and very reasonably priced and the experience is like a MINI VACATION!!!

I take everyone here!! I take my friend from Canada when she visits, my sister, my dad, my ex-mother-in-law (yes, we are still friends), I make arrangements to meet my friends here, and any friend or family who comes to town! My husband and I go out of our way to bring our kid to THIS location! We will pass on all three other locations closer to home to experience THIS Dillon's!!

I don't care if I had to pay $10.00 per person (the average price of lunch options) just to sit in front of the shark tank for a couple hours and get NO FOOD!! Come on people!!! NO ONE should give this place less than FIVE stars!!

The food is GOOD, the prices are CHEAP and the experience is UNFORGETTABLE!!! The photo opportunities are so INCREDIBLE, creating memories that will last a lifetime, for adults and especially for kids!!! 

The manager, Austin, is an asset to Dillon's!! The servers are outstanding!! They probably are so efficient so they can move you out so they can seat the next excited guests, but you will never feel rushed!! 

This Dillon's is one of our favorite spots to dine!! We never get tired of watching the majestic sharks, huge sting rays, and other huge sized fish swimming around and around in the HUGE CEILING to FLOOR sized tank visible from any table!!!

OR...you might want to hang at the bar where it is open to the flamingo island! There are dozens of flamingos in view from the bar area! If the weather is nice, it's a UNIQUE and awesome option! Where else in the Valley are you going to have this experience at a BAR? Oh, and if it's the \"season\" these birds are quite active, if you know what I mean!!"}
{"text":"Wonderfully beautiful restaurant. How dare anyone give less than five stars. The staff are lovely. There is a shark tank in the restaurant for crying out loud !!! How badass  is that ? Great for bbq food. I actually got the prickly peach salad and thought it was really fantastic ! It was a really hopping place for a Saturday night.. it was totally crowded, lots of families, and noise level is a bit loud, but just speak up."}
{"text":"Ordered turkey and ham dinners for Thanksgiving and was blown away with how good everything was. Considering these were specialty items for Thanksgiving that normally aren't cooked, I can only imagine how good the other bbq choices are. Best baked beans I've ever had. As a matter of fact all of the sides tasted great and were cooked perfectly. Definitely going back again."}
{"text":"We come here every Thanksgiving and are never disappointed. Lauren, our server, was so nice and took care of everything so efficiently. Plenty of food and a nice atmosphere. Definitely the place to go anytime."}
{"text":"Dillon's KC BBQ (DKB) is an AZ chain of BBQ Restaurants that has four locations statewide. This particular location is very unique, as it's located in/at the Wildlife World Zoo & Aquarium. You don't actually have to visit the zoo in order to dine here, as there are entrances on the outside and in. We visited DKB while at the zoo on Thanksgiving after my sister heard from a friend about their Turkey Day specials from last year. What could be better than a trip to the Zoo followed by some Q?! Let's eat!

Meat: 

BBQ Beef Brisket- Their Brisket had a nice smoke ring and good flavor, but the cut they gave me was entirely too lean and dried-out. Luckily their smoky, sweet BBQ sauce was able to add some much needed moisture and save the dish. 2.5*

Smoked Turkey- The Turkey was decent, as it was juicy and had a good flavor, but the smoke was definitely lacking in it. Seems like it might've been started on the smoker and finished in the oven?? 3*

Sides:

Dinner Roll- I usually don't mention rolls, but this one was exceptional! Sweet, pillowy-soft and melted right in my mouth... It put King's Hawaiian rolls to shame. I could've eaten a bucket of these and been very happy. 5*

Sweet Potato Casserole- I love the big chunks of Sweet Potato, and they were cooked perfectly with just the right amount of sweetness. 4.5*

BBQ Baked Beans- The beans were cooked perfectly and had a nice peppery, smokiness to them, but just a touch too sweet. Otherwise, terrific. 4*

Dessert:

Blueberry Peach Cobbler- I don't see this item on their online menu, so I'm not sure if it's part of their regular rotation or just a Turkey Day special? Crispy crust, perfectly sweetened and cooked fruit with a generous scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream made my taste buds jump for joy! If it's not a part of their regular menu--it should be! 5*

Service & Ambiance- I wish I remembered our server's name, but he did a terrific job despite the place being a complete madhouse; our orders were correct and we were never left wanting. This particular DKB is known for sharing walls with the Zoo's Aquarium--and more importantly their 60,000 gallon Shark tank!! Unfortunately, the wait for an inside seat was too long so we settled on dining al fresco on their patio which has a great view of the Flamingo exhibit. 5* 

Value- The pricing here at KDB is actually really reasonable, as we only paid $13 for a plate full of Q that would normally cost around $20 at most other BBQ establishments. Plus, the fact that you're in a zoo would almost guarantee price gouging but none of that here! 4.5*

Settling on a final rating for DKB was not easy, as all my little min-ratings averaged out to slightly better than 4-stars. However, they *are* a BBQ restaurant and all the terrific sides, desserts, service and ambiance in the world doesn't mean much if the Q doesn't hold up... Maybe Little Miss and Bobby Q's has set my AZ Q standards too high, but it is what it is. I will definitely give them another shot next time I'm in AZ, and hopefully I can kick them up to at least a four. Still, very highly recommended if you're visiting the zoo as it beats the hell out of the crap at the concession stands."}
{"text":"I can't get over how great the service here was. It started off a little iffy; we waited for 5-10 minutes without anyone checking on us. However, Amanda W. picked up on the dilemma right before we were gonna go ask who was supposed to be helping us. She went out of her way to, and away from her section, to make sure that we were well taken care of and happy. She really made this a great lunch experience. Huge shoutout to Amanda! Carl, one of the managers, came over to check on us as well and was very pleasant and nice to us. The food came out in a very timely manner and was, of course, superb. Way to go Dillon's! This was our first time eating here. We moved from TX and were hesitant to try BBQ out here. You've changed our mind with great service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was amazing! Family friendly. Service was fantastic. Food was not the best I've had, but their BBQ sauces made it better.  I would come back again and plan too."}
{"text":"The food was good and the wait staff was friendly. The ambience was nice, especially with the shark tank. We ordered the smoked bone in chicken with loaded mashed potatoes and macaroni and the pick 2 plate with beef brisket and pulled pork BBQ.  Everything tasted good, it wasn't the best BBQ I have ever had, NC BBQ is by far the best, but this was the best I have had in AZ thus far. I will definitely eat here again and try some other things. The only thing I was disappointed about was the veg of the day was corn on the cob, I'm not a huge fan of corn."}
{"text":"I was taken here for my birthday.  

The staff were very friendly and attentive.  Went on a Friday night, so it was very busy.  

I loved the shark aquarium!  It really is a must see!  

The food is excellent, and love their 3 entree plate.  Very moderately price, and you get a lot of food.   Among the best BBQ I've had.  

Probably the only negative I can say is when I was there, because it was so busy, the table was not properly cleaned when we were first seated, but when I told the waitress, she got it cleaned up right away and made it right."}
{"text":"I have had the catfish, the brisket, the baby back ribs, a burger and the chicken fried steak. All of it very good. the fish the the cfs were the best of the bunch. The service is friendly and the prices are fair."}
{"text":"Good place to grab a bite.  Aquarium is nice and I had the smoked chicken which was very good moist and tender.  Service was cheerful and prompt only reason not giving a five star felt a little dark and led to a feeling of not the amateurism as you could also see the work station for the servers."}
{"text":"Good place. Came for lunch with my employees. Service was good, but save this for a weekend if you have a set lunch period/time limit. I ordered the grilled chicken club sandwich with loaded mashed potatoes. Sandwich was good but the chicken was a little dry. We also tried the fried mushrooms and they were good too. I think the best thing was being able to watch the sharks swimming around in the aquarium while I ate."}
{"text":"We visited the Dillon's located in the Wildlife World Zoo. The zoo was not overly busy this day. We waited 20 minutes to be seated which was one with us, we expected a little wait. When we were seated, our server was very nice and professional, but after she took our order it took about 45 minutes to get our food. As annoying as this was, it was actually a big inconvenience because we had an antsy 5 year old and a 4 month old with us. When we finally got our food it was not bad but not great, and definitely not worth the wait. On a positive note, we only paid about $50 for 3 adult entrees, 1 child's meal, and 3 beers."}
{"text":"We came here yesterday for Mother's Day and we were surprised to see how packed it was. We had made reservations and even then we had to wait about 20-30 minutes. People who were coming in without reservations were waiting upward of an hour and a half, which I guess is to be expected on any holiday.

It was extremely packed. It was difficult to find parking because it combines with the parking for the zoo. The waiting area and the area where you go to see the hostess is more than a bit tight, so it was difficult to get in. I do love that they honored my request and sat us next to the aquarium. This was our first time here so it was a nice treat. We chose this place because it was family friendly.

Our server was awesome. Despite all the chaos, she was friendly and got everything right. She did great. I ordered the brisket platter which included 2 sides and my mother and I both got ice cream for free for Mother's Day.

The food was okay. It was not the best barbeque I've ever tasted, but I feel that it was reasonably priced and the aquarium made it worth it. If you have little one's I would advise that you go on a day when it is not so crowded. My got pretty anxious with so many people in such tight quarters."}
{"text":"Well, I have to say that the customer service was GREAT!! This is why I gave it 3 stars. Very friendly folks.it is a convenient place right next to the wildlife park. Now on to the issues:

This is a restaurant and people go here (hopefully) for good food. The food was not good. My kids would not touch the Mac N Cheese or the beans. The shells were hard and the cheese was like nacho cheese from the can.

The water tasted like charcoal filtered river water.

The brisket was dry and covered up with mediocre bbq sauce (I'm guessing to make it taste better)

If you are going to tag your place as a bbq joint - the Mac N Cheese should fit and be baked and seasoned, the brisket should be cooked right and you shouldn't have to lay a ton of sauce all over the plate.

If you want to see sharks swim while you eat and don't care about taste - you will like this place."}
{"text":"Came here to eat a couple of times and got to sit next to the shark tank which is always awesome. It's a great spot to bring a family or have a romantic date night with your other half. The food is good and they also have great appetizers. The servers there are always friendly and the management pitches into help when they are busy. It's awesome to see such great leadership skills like that. I loved the atmosphere and couldn't complain about the food. Wait time is always down and the food gets there fast. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Cool place where you can sit and watch flamingos on the patio or fish in a huge fish tank inside. Food was good and the service was decent. The place could definitely use a renovation and some updating on the inside."}
{"text":"The worst BBQ place to go to! 
Me and my boyfriend are from out of town
And thought we should try a place out here.
The food comes out, my boyfriend order what was suppose to be \"the really hot\" sauce and he got the very sweet one. And I had the wrong sauce all together on my meat. We called the waiter over and she was very rude about it. She was like no \" I poured the sauce on, I know it correct. Okay cool, she said she will bring more meat out plain with sauce on the side. Comes out and what do you know it very dry meat. Now the best part of the meal was when I went to cut open my bake potato there was \"mold\" on it , are you kidding me??? Can't believe we got nothing takin off or a manger never came over!!!! The worst"}
{"text":"Strange place. No atmosphere whatsoever....except for the giant aquarium.....but it only had a few fish in it.
Super expensive ($25 beef ribs!!!!) considering the fact that they don't bbq their own meats. Sliced brisket flavorless & dry. Burnt ends not crispy/crunchy at all! Over cooked baked potatoes, good fries. Good bbq sauce. Water tastes like it's pumped directly from the aquarium. 2 small cocktails $12. Really nice employees though."}
{"text":"I thought he food was very average. Our sever....and dang I can't remember her name.....was outstanding!! The place was clean and the decor is obviously a big draw!  All that said, I had the special of the day which was their special BBQ ribs pulled off the bone on an opened faced sandwich. The meat was dry and not typical pork flavor, the sauce aw good, but the vegetable medley was undercooked. The cottage cheese was perfect.....and the best thing on the plate!

Time to wake up that kitchen help a bit.....they're getting lazy!! A little work and it could be a home run!

Note to the Yelpers that didn't like the kids running around: Uhhhh...you are at a zoo!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good BBQ right next to a shark tank. $2 PBR and Brontosaurus Beef Ribs bigger than a toddler's torso. 3 unique, but spot-on sauces. Great cocktail and draft selection. Burnt ends were tender and juicy but not caramelized. Kids' chicken tenders were hand-breaded, and worth stealing, when their gaze shifts to the shark tank. Also, didn't seem to have any zoo-related price inflation."}
{"text":"If I could give less then one star I would!! This place was horrible, boiled flavorless, cold meat and way overpriced!! I will never go back! Not to mention the place was swarmed with flies! Ick!!"}
{"text":"Love wildlife world zoo and have been a couple times.  Never had the chance to try Dillons though so after this visit we thought we would give it a shot.  There is a big aquarium table side so that is pretty fun!  The food is touted as KC BBQ and surprisingly it was pretty good.  

We ordered the pulled pork sandwich, pulled chicken and hamburger.  The meals all ran about $10 and for a \"Nice\" restaurant at a zoo, we were all pleasantly surprised.  It was a nice way to end our visit and to rest the legs a bit before the drive back home.

Not disappointed and would eat there again!"}
{"text":"Kinda on the fence of between a three and a four star. My daughter lives not far form this Dillon's. We have eaten at two of their places in the Phoenix area had their food is good. 
This Dillon's is at the Wild Life Zoo and has a large aquarium in the dining area. I found the food to be good and enjoyed watching the fish in the aquarium. There were many people with children eating there as you would expect, being it is at the Zoo. I enjoyed watching them looking at the fish mostly sharks. 
The service was a little slow even though the place was not crowded but we did not mind as there was 7 of us there and we enjoyed talking and catching up. 
Would I go back? Yes if I was in the area. 
My grandson enjoyed the fish. Especially the Piranha that was in a small aquarium in the lobby."}
