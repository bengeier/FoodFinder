{"text":"This is by far my favorite breakfast joint. 

Very casual and unpretentious, with friendly service, they have the BIGGEST breakfast menu I've ever seen. Prices are reasonable, variety is incredible and portions are large. Most of all, the food is great!

Change from the big restaurant chains with unoriginal menus and try this instead!"}
