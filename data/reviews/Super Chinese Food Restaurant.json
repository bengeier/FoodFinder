{"text":"You had me at free ginger beef. But for real, the name isn't a lie, it really is super Chinese food. They always deliver faster than they tell you, the food is hot and fresh, and it is great value with the portions being gigantic! The chicken balls were the best and weren't just batter like with most places, and the sweet and sour pork was awesome too. A dinner for 1 is easily dinner and lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Honey lemon chicken yow, great take out, fast, dine in kinda rudimentary, take it home and enjoy"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent value. Owned and operated by a hard working family who set decent standards and try hard to do right by their customers. Our family have been customers here for 20 years and we have never been disappointed -- except when they are closed for occasional holidays. This business is an asset to our community."}
{"text":"Tasty food, tasty everything! Great local Chinese food for take-out! Big fan of the chow mien and the ginger beef! VERY Tasty!"}
{"text":"Their food for its price is great
Quality is ok
But the portion for its price 
Especially their combination meal is unbeatable 
They did not have hot sauce tho :("}
{"text":"We have been repeat customers at Super Chinese Food for the past 3 years! I've tried various restaurants around the city and have found them to have good food, at a great price. The chicken fried rice container is always stuffed and overflowing.. The ginger beef is tender and chewy, not dry and crispy. Everything is amazing fresh, but even better warmed up the following day. The interior is quite a bit dated, truly a \"whole in the wall\", but we always order pickup and could care less about esthetics.

Thank you for speedy service and incredible food!"}
{"text":"Friday night, after we looked at the 3rd house in Calgary, we were so hungry. We found a small restaurant nearby. The restaurant is located on Palliser Dr. South West Calgary.  The name of the restaurant is called Super Chinese Food Restaurant. It owned by an old Chinese Couple. It's a small restaurant, offers people to dine in and take out services. We arrived the restaurant around 6 pm, which was right on the dinner time. We were super surprised that there were none customers in the restaurant. I guess most people are ordered food to take out. We quickly found a table and sat down. The restaurant is Chinese Style Setting and each table is nice & clean. After answered the phone call, the server brought menu and water to our table. There are many selections on the menu. Both of us choose Special Dinner for One person $12.95. The Special Dinner has included two dishes and served with Chicken Fried Rice & Wonton Soup. It was a great deal. My boyfriend had Sweet&Sour Pork and Stir-Fried Mixed Vegetables. I had Ginger Beef and Stir-Fried Mixed Vegetables. After ordered, the food came a little bit of slow. But, you could hear that people cook the food in the kitchen. After waited for 15 ~ 20 minutes, the food came out the kitchen. The vegetables were very fresh. The Beef and Pork dishes were well cooked and tasty. Comparing this food to Lethbridge Chinese Food, the food here was awesome. Also, our dinner combos were all in the huge portion. It was very great experiences eating at Super Chinese Food Restaurant."}
