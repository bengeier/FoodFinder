{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast spot. It has been here for decades and all the locals know and love it. Sammy is so sweet and the food is always great. Don't let the fact that it's in a hotel lobby fool you, this place has great atmosphere and feels like an old fashioned diner."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic breakfast, sat at the bar and had a nice chat with Sammy the owner and chef.  Great food and a wonderful atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Sammy's place is one of those places that you you need to know about.  It takes you back to a place in time to the breakfast table during your childhood where you're treated to a wholesome meal served by someone that cares for you.  Sammy greets all of his customers with a smile and makes sure you leave with one as well.  The meals are affordable and cooked to order.  Make sure next time your around you make sure to stop bully for a visit and pay homage to a Cleveland staple."}
{"text":"I nice local haunt still run by the man himself. Service was a touch on the slow side but it was pretty busy. Can't wait to try a milkshake."}
{"text":"I went the morning after St Patrick's day. Everyone in town was hung over. Sammy's was relatively quiet with a small crowd.  It was perfect. The restroom (shared with hotel) was really clean too."}
{"text":"Typical lunch faire, but it's all done right.  I've yet to have something from the menu that isn't amazing.  Try the Samira's Omlette with homefries.

Only downside is that it can get a little cramped during lunch; if it's crowded, it can take a little while to sit and get your food."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast, mushroom omelette with American cheese, hash browns, rye toast and a side of sausage.  Coffee was decent as well from a standard coffeemaker.  All for under $10.  Also, Sammy cooked and served from behind the counter.  Americana diner feel."}
{"text":"Cute little dinner in the lobby of the Holiday Inn.
Breakfast was fresh and hot. Kids loved their omelets. I had a nice two egg breakfast.
Coffee was a little weak but I'm picky.
Sammie runs the whole place and cooks."}
{"text":"I had a turkey sandwich and fries here the other day. The place was clean and the waitress was nice, but I could tell it was cheap turkey by the texture and taste. For $6.25 I feel like I deserve better turkey than I could get at Aldi's."}
{"text":"AMAZING diner! So happy I found a real throwback style diner in Cleveland, the good greasy breakfast food I so miss from my childhood. The staff is so warm and inviting, friendly and attentive. The food is great prices with a great selection. Just a heads up they are CASH only !  I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Hurrah!!  A genuine old school diner run by real pros.  I'm traveling often now to Cleveland and discovered this gem thanks to Yelp.  (It really is in the lobby of the hotel with just a poster in the window on the street letting you know the place is there).  Breakfasts drive me crazy at hotels with their costs and delivery.  At Sammy's, the hash browns are actually brown, the toast is dark (not just warm bread that seems to be the norm everywhere these days), and the eggs are hand scrambled in a bowl before being cooked in a pan rather than slathered on the grill and chopped up.  And it's actually Sammy wielding the spatula and his daughter taking care of you in a fast and friendly way.

Gonna try the pancakes this morning....   ;-)

Carry on, team!

UPDATE:  Had the pancakes and sorry to say they were not up to par with the egg dishes.  Almost medium rare and barely brown....sigh"}
{"text":"Friendly and accommodating. I'd recommend the hashbrowns. The atmosphere is nice. There are a lot of breakfast options, so if you're in the area, I'd definitely recommend checking it out for breakfast."}
{"text":"Loved this hidden gem!! Great Father / daughter team. Yummy breakfast ....good conversation.  My breakfast was cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"First time here, went with co-workers.   I never knew that this place existed.  It's tucked nicely away in a large office building.  The place was pretty crowded for lunch on a Monday.   Serves diner type food.  I opted for the grilled chicken wrap with fries for $6.25.  The sandwich was served fresh and warm with shredded cheese, lettuce tomato and ranch dressing with a side of crinkle cut fries.    I would definitely return, the food, price and value can't be beat."}
{"text":"A delicious treat on our final day traveling.  Do yourself a favor and skip any hotel breakfast for this diamond in the rough.  Sammy has been at the same location for 45 years.  The coffee was delicious, the omelet perfect and Sammy and his daughter were wonderful chatting with.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Rating a place on breakfast is always challenging.  I mean, let's face it, there aren't too any variations.  This little place inside a Holiday Inn was exactly what I expected it to be.  A diner.  Long counter, a few tables and a cook who is stereotypical of diner cooks...grumpy (I mean that in a good way).  I had an omelet.  It was cooked on a flat top, came with hash browns and it was delicious.  It came with the typical diner stale bread toast with margarine lightly patted on it.  The food is good and it's cheap.  You can tell the cook enjoys making up his specials menu for the day and enjoys cooking.  Dinging one star because....like most diners, everything not used the night before, or who knows how many days ago, is reused today (beware soup and chili fans).  More than likely it is tonight's special.  If it is something fried, count on it being something from a freezer bag fried in oil that should have been changed back at Xmas time.  If that's your thing....then go for it.  Cheap quick breakfast..absolutely stop here.  Not into a fancy sandwich shop for lunch, here again.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Tucked inside the lobby of the Holiday Inn Express next to the PNC Building, Sammy's is a little diner that serves up breakfast and lunch staples for prices that don't break the bank. One of the few downtown breakfast places open on Saturday, I was glad Sammy's was as good as it is convenient. Bacon here is crisp, potatoes are better than Huran St diner and my heart is still true to the people at PJs but this is definitely where you'll find me the next Saturday morning I get a taste for eating breakfast out in the East 4th neighborhood."}
{"text":"Top shelf diner.  A true throwback with an amazingly friendly staff.  The best Sloppy Joe anywhere hands down.  Make this gem a priority next time you're downtown."}
{"text":"Good breakfast!!! Samira's omelette is the best!!! Hands down one of the best places in Cleveland for breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Stayed at the Holiday Inn Express on Euclid and discovered this tiny little diner! Sammy himself works the grill and cooks all of the homemade style breakfast/lunch. Great place, could not be happier to find and support a classic American diner!"}
{"text":"Food I OK .  Yes true diner atmosphere.  

Too bad the owner was a grumpy old man who decided to yell at my sick kid who couldn't happen to find the restroom.  And then proceeded to yell at him because he dared ask for his hot chocolate.  Will never return. No place to act like that in today's society."}
{"text":"The decor could use a little updating and it's not great for groups but it's a cute little diner where Sammy & his daughter make and serve some really good food. I would go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"A good diner experience. I'd visit this spot again, good tasting food for a good price. I had pancakes, eggs & cornbeef hash... The cornbeef hash was delicious & not out of a can so I recommend you try it. The place has an old school diner feel and is located in the lobby of a building with no outside view."}
{"text":"From the gray carpeting to the dull green walls, the cheap fixtures, the lack of art or music to the so-so food and slow service this place can best be described as dull, bland and boring mixed with no ambience at all.  Playhouse Square has done a real disservice to itself and it's patrons by leasing this space out to this operator.  Time for Sammy to retire."}
{"text":"True Diner atmosphere.  I went to Sammy's Grille for breakfast.  The breakfast sandwich was good, but on the greasy side which i was fine with, but others may not be."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. In a sea of restaurant chains , this is a blast from the past. Reminds me of when I was a kid going to a diner with my grandfather. Very friendly service, great prices and good solid American style breakfast. It's a little hard to find, but worth it."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good, and so far it's one of my favorite diner style restaurants in Cleveland, more for its relaxed atmosphere than anything else.  There's counter seating that overlooks the grill and about 10 tables, so it's fairly small and cozy.  The folks that run the place are authentically friendly, and you get just the right amount of service that doesn't cross into annoyance like many chain restaurants.

Sammy's closes early, just like everything else in downtown, so make sure you check the hours before venturing out to find it.  I walked past the building several times looking for this place before I realized it was inside the same building as the Holiday Inn Express.  You'll have to walk past the hotel parking kiosk to get in."}
{"text":"Quick, cheap, and the food tastes great! It's simple food, so don't come here if you're expecting brunch at the Sheraton."}
{"text":"Tired of the free hotel breakfast? This is your savior. Father/daughter team clearly love their town and traditional diner fare. The veggie omelette is outstanding and the coffee is strong. Today (August 17, 2015) they just raised prices for the first time 8 years -- and it's still a bargain. Eat like a local."}
{"text":"a true hidden gem! we are staying at the HIE and decided to give Sammy's a try since we wanted a real breakfast. I got the cheese omelette and my husband got the ham and cheese omelette. both were cooked fresh to order in front of us along with the hashbrowns. everything was delicious and Sammy is a great guy! our only regret is not trying this place sooner because we leave tomorrow."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and fries! Everything here is tastey. I think this is a great place to stop in for a beer and a burger and watch some sports! Everyone needs a little of that sometimes!"}
