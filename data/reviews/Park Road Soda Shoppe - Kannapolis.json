{"text":"Great diner food and atmosphere. Varied menu, desserts made on site, very nice staff!  Burgers are great, Tater tots great, chicken salad very good and plentiful, grilled pimento cheese sandwich awesome. Will keep going back!"}
{"text":"I'm a breakfast person and this place checks all the boxes on my loves of their breakfast platters. We're new to the area so this place is now a very frequented meal choice of our family. Hamburgers and fries are great too. Plenty of other choices too and love the oldies music playing."}
{"text":"Burgers are amazing. The milkshakes are made right in front of you and are easily the best I've ever had. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is way too expensive for a little town like Kannapolis, it's reminiscent of something you'd eat at a vacation hot spot and pay triple what it's worth. 10$ for hot dog fries and a drink and it's no better than Hardee's. As for the staff they were great and facility is clean."}
{"text":"Very good always very friendly . Tuna sandwich is really good !!!! Ice cream is really good too"}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place. It's a block away from our house and we had high hopes. Unfortunately we were very disappointed. The service was good and the people were friendly which accounts for both of the 2 stars....but the food was not good and they are overpriced. The burgers were overcooked and flavorless. The fries were right out of a bag and not seasoned at all. The fried pickles had a decent flavor but had way too much breading. The chili was flavorless and watery.  Honestly, I would've been happier with fast food and it would've been less then half the price."}
{"text":"this place is a great restaurant to get a quick bite. the service is the best and i look foward to it everytime i go"}
{"text":"Great place. Takes you back to the good days. Love the music and the food has never been a disappointment. Just wish there was one in Denver NC."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my food from the parking lot it smelled great. Me and the family had grunted chicken sandwiches all were great. Tater tots were good. We all split a  split which was very good. The burgers i saw coming out of the kitchen looked great"}
{"text":"We had the fried pickles and they were very greasy.  The footlong hot dog was average at best. The staff was very attentive and friendly. I will give this place one more chance."}
{"text":"We had lunch today. Really had high hopes due to other folks really liking it. Wife ordered the fish dinner plate. It was two pre breaded flounder filets....In the South and being a Greek Owned place that is a No No. The the Onion Rings are pre made also? Then it was served with a grilled flat hotdog bun. What I find strange is everything is a la carte. My sons grilled cheese was well done and almost burned. The mac and cheese ...dry noodles . Hey maybe just an off day but don't think we will hit it again. Too many other options. I can say that it was a very very clean place with great music."}
{"text":"Good Menu well executed with Retro Atmosphere.  I love the theme.  I grew up in a small town in Western NC and we had  three independent drugs stores and each had a lunch counter / soda shop. Great place to meet after school or to grab a quick bite when we would come to town with our parents.  This started with a Park Road Soda Shoppe in Charlotte which was needless to say on Park Road.  A couple of years ago the took over a Restaurant formerly known as Rosie's in Kannapolis and opened a 2nd Park Road Soda Shoppe.  Decor is straight out of the 50's and the piped in music straight from the early 60's.  Buddy Holly anyone.  Walked in and were told to take any seat we wanted. Problem was all the empty seats were at tables that had not been cleaned yet. To told us to go ahead and take a seat and they would immediately clean the table which they did.  Sat down at a booth and the bench obviously needs repair because it gave way and my rear hit the metal support bar underneath.  Beyond that was the booth behind me. Ever been on a plane with you had a kit kicked the back of your seat.  Had the same problem except the kid was 6'6\" and probably weighed 300 lbs.  Eventually he did settle down.  It's a good menu with something for everyone. and it would appear that there are other items available that are not on the printed menu such as Philly Cheese steak.  My wife started with the Soup of the Day which was a very hearty Potato Soup and it came out piping hot. For her entree, she order a Fish Sandwich ( would have been the Philly Cheese steak if she had known that was available) and a side of Fried Squash.  My ordered a Grilled Peanut Butter and Banana Sandwich and a side of marinated Cucumbers, Tomatoes and Onions.  At the end, I did opt for a Strawberry Milk Shake.  Everything was great. Wife enjoyed her Potato Soup and is still talking about it. She said the fish was good which from her is unusual because she normally does not order seafood. The Fried Squash came with a Ranch Dipping Sauce that was very good.  Portion size was very large so I ended up eating part of it.  I have not had a Peanut Butter and Banana Sandwich since probably back in the 50 and 60's when I was growing up with those three drug stores in Brevard NC.  It was good and a nice throwback.  The Marinated Salad was excellent and the Milkshake even had bits of fresh Strawberries in it.  Only served with a straw but I should have asked for a spoon.  Excellent choice for Saturday lunch. We've tried to to before but keep forgetting they are closed on Sundays so this worked out well.  There are a number of items I want to try next time such as the Pork Chop  Sandwiches and Grilled Pork Chops. That big jar of Kosher Dill Pickles near the front look intriguing.  Definitely a destination for a future lunch."}
{"text":"The Park Road Soda Shop is a great place for a 50's style burger. Diner food as I remember it.  The hamburger is hand made. The fries and onion rings are crisp and hot. The root beer float is to die for! Visit soon you won't be disapointed."}
{"text":"Food isn't that good, not impressive at all, prices are very high. Almost 8.00 for a banana split. They even charge for water, are you serious!!!! Save your money go somewhere else"}
{"text":"I bring the wife here because from time to time she doesn't want to cook. Lately she's been pulling the \"I don't wanna cook, let's go to the soda shoppe\" card. I gotta fix that squeaky wheel, but that's another story for another day. Where was I....oh yeah the soda shoppe. So I'm reading the reviews...how in the blue h3ll are these idiots giving this place anything less than 4 stars. WTF. Some broad is complaining about a hot dog....if u don't like the hot dog order something else. But no...she had to get on Yelp to complain about a hot dog, kids are starving in Africa somewhere, but this chick is complaining about a $3 hot dog. Anyway. The wife likes the fried pickles, I enjoy the cheeseburger. This place also has the best Vanilla Coke of all times. The vegetables are awesome too. The okra cuts right thru me though. Nonetheless, this place is a definite must try....unlike these other over rated burger joints around here, I.e. Shake Shack (gross) SmackBurger (yuck) & McCatsNDogs. Hope u enjoyed this review."}
{"text":"It is okay.   Decor is like an older soda shop.   Food is bland.  The egg salad, chicken, salad, and Mac and cheese claim to be home made, but it looks like it is from a tub.  They have little taste too, very bland.   You cannot get refills on lemonade - their reasoning was that it is freshly made.  I ordered it anyway.  When it came, I took a couple of sips of it And it tasted more like water.  I out the straw in it and the \"lemonade\" was at the bottom of the cup.   I had to stir it up.  Odd.  Okay service but a little slow.  3 stars is the best I could do."}
{"text":"Great old fashioned diner.  Burgers are delicious.  Kids enjoyed the tater tots and delicious ice cream.  Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Great service the staff was awesome and very attentive. I came with my children and they ordered off the kids menu. They have the typical packaged chicken nuggets which were fried to hard, my son couldn't eat  them. The other son enjoyed his burger and macaroni cheese. I ordered the footlong (all the way) this included chill I said homemade tasted like can chili with minced meat, cole slaw ( chopped and minced) and a vey thin too soft hotdogs with a slice of melted American cheese. It wasn't for my taste I wanted to like the food I had just couldn't get pass my taste buds."}
{"text":"Cute place. Nice job on 50s soda shoppe theme. Not overly cheesy.  Service was great. Food was good. Really really liked their fried pickles. I'll will certainly come back."}
{"text":"Came in and liked the scenery. Ordered a burger, and you can instantly tell with the first bite, that it's fresh. The fries are really good too. Was tempted to get a hand spun milkshake but I was full after my meal. Definitely would eat here again."}
{"text":"Cute little spot with a throwback 50's feel. Hubby even got apple pie with a slice of cheddar cheese on top. Prices are great and food was delicious. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The food is ok. They cannot get a take out order correct if their life depended on it. I've given them 3 times and every time something was incorrect. So don't get take out just eat there, if you can get in. This place has a ton of senior regulars and they will even reserve a table for these regulars. Like I said the food is just ok."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout so we didn't experience the full restaurant experience but the food was amazing. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The best kept secret in Kannapolis.  The best desserts especially the Custard Pie!! Worth going for alone!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices.   I highly recommend the fried pickles, chili and grilled peanut butter and banana sandwich! Great flavor and textures. The fried bologna and cheese sandwich is a staple of childhood memories and they serve it here!   The chicken tenders are juicy and meaty, the fried okra is fresh and tasty. I can't wait to go back and try the other menu items.   The owner was very polite, courteous and outgoing. I wish this restaurant all the success in the world.  EDIT : Someone said in their review that the food here was \"overpriced\" LOL. Seriously? There is nothing on the menu over $8. Most items are $5 or less. Sour grapes."}
{"text":"Nice place for date night. Everything seemed reasonably priced. However, it ended up being much more than expected after everything was said and done."}
