{"text":"Good food, reasonable prices, but very slow service and not warm enough inside.  

I chose Corazon for lunch with co-workers, based on location.  With only two reviews, both 5 stars, I was skeptical.  They didn't earn 5 stars for us that day. 

The place was almost empty at noon on a weekday.  Only two or three other tables with customers.  Maybe the word hasn't gotten around, or maybe people try it once and don't come back.  The point is the service was slow, and it wasn't because they were busy.  Our food came out one dish at a time (there were seven of us!)  It took 15-20 minutes from the first to the last.  And the chips and salsa ran out twice and we had to ask for more.  

And it was really chilly in the restaurant.  I had to keep my jacket on the entire meal.  The weather was unusually cold for Phoenix, so maybe the furnace can't keep up, but my guess is they were just trying to keep their heating bill down.

The food was very good, and the prices were reasonable ($13-14 each, incl tax & tip, without alcohol).  I'm willing to try it again, but maybe with a smaller group of people, during milder weather!"}
{"text":"Don't let the location fool you. Food is really good and made fresh. You can tell they  take pride in their food. We just found them on yelp, coming in from out of town."}
{"text":"I wanted to like the place. The staff is very friendly and attentive, although they were disorganized (seemed new to the restaurant business). 

We came in on a Friday night with the Living Social deal which was $19 for two house margaritas, an appetizer, and two entrees. 

First off, the house margaritas which are six dollars were not good at all. Couldn't taste any tequila, obvious taste of cheap margarita mix and could not taste any triple sec. 

Next was the appetizer. We went for the cheese crisp. This was a flour tortilla with cheddar cheese and a small helping of sour cream and lettuce to top with for $7. Very disappointed with appetizer. 

As for the entrees, I got the parrilada with chicken and shrimp and my girlfriend got the Verde chicken enchiladas. My meal was $15 regularly and hers was $8 plus $4 more for rice and beans. Neither meal was impressive, and the prices were much higher than most other places in the valley, particularly in this area. 

Chips (flour) and \"salsa\" were a little different and tasted fine, but i much prefer fresh salsa made with vegetables. I am not sure what the orange sauce like concoction that they gave us was, but I would not call it salsa. 

Moved to Arizona from Texas almost 3 years ago and have yet to find a Mexican restaurant that is tasty and reasonably priced, and this one disappointed as well. 

I would not recommend, you will pay too much for something that you could get at one of the bertos restaurants. Also avoid the margarita at all costs. It was well overpriced for the quality. Head over to La Condesca if you are wanting to spend 10-12 on some tasty quality Mexican food."}
{"text":"Wow! Best restaurant food we had all year!
Got myself Carne Asada Tacos - $8.95, wife had Fried steak burrito - $8.95. Both loved it. If you are on low calorie, I suggest Carne Asada Tacos. Otherwise Burrito. Burrito is huge ! Got dessert, Churro with Icecream, which was delicious. Margarita, spicy and hot- $7.95. I'm coming back!!"}
{"text":"Was within walking distance from my hotel.   Name isn't the same.   Food was delicious and a full belly when I walked away.    No beer or liquor license currently so only soda.   After traveling was hoping for a cerveza too."}
{"text":"Great Enchiladas awesome chimichangas great chips and salsa get the red salsa very delicious great place for lunch and dinner"}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like it.  Its very authentic, unfortunately not everyone from a foreign place is a great cook...

The mini chimichangas were probably the best part of the meal though one of them had unrolled a bit in the frying process.  They put shredded meat, red onion and green and red peppers in it which was a nice touch.  Then it goes downhill...

Carne asada - the meat was very grisley and rather bland.  It wasn't cooked great, had a weird coloring.  The fajita platter - the chicken was basically a flattened, pan fried salt and pepper seasoned meat.  Shrimp was also not interesting.  The meat was the same as carne asada.

They're very nice and all.  I wish the food and the general order of the place was a little better.."}
{"text":"I gotta say I really never take time to review places I visit, but I wanted to praise this place, because I was blown away by my brunch today.  This is a new restaurant so I was excited to try it out.  They didn't disappoint!  The chips and salsa they started us out with are homemade, and super delicious!  We ordered about 3 refills of the homemade salsa.  It had a unique taste, but packed with flavor, and just the right amount of spice.  I had the Red Chile Chilaquiles with eggs.  They serve generously, so come hungry!  What I loved about the chilaquiles was the flavor of the sauce, and the texture of the actual chilaquiles were a little bit crunchy, just like my mom makes them.  This restaurant has a big variety of items, from fresh sea food, to traditional mexican food.  We met one of the owners today as well.  They have extensive experience cooking good food at other reputable valley restaurants, and have even been praised on television for this.  I will certainly return with my friends and family."}
