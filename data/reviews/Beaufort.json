{"text":"I've been to this resto 3 times and eaten there twice. Each time the food was good, but the service, terrible. And without exaggerating, the service was so bad, it literally distracts you from the food which is why that's pretty much all I will write about in my review.

The first time my husband and I went, it was on a Tuesday evening and there were maybe 3 other tables being served. Upon entering, we immediately got the vibe that the waiter wasn't too happy to see us (you know that 'why are these people bothering me' vibe?). The service was exceedingly long across the board: taking our order, getting the food and bringing the bill. It literally felt like he forgot about us and we had to go inside after 10-15min of waiting to pay our bill. But, the food was good so we thought maybe he's just having a bad night, so perhaps it's worth trying again.

The second time we went, we were with a friend from out of town (party of 3) and wanted to try somewhere close to home and different. Why not Cafe Beaufort? This time the place was full and we were served by a new waitress. I say 'new' because she was painfully shy, to the point of being awkward and we ended up having to repeat our order twice and she still got it wrong. Again however, the food was very good so now we were very much on the fence. 

After waiting a few weeks, my husband and I decided to give it a go for a third time. On this occasion when we walked in minutes to 8, the waitress looked at us and said that unfortunately the kitchen had just closed. Now I should explain that it's a Thursday night, the place was at least half full and they advertise being open until 11pm! 

It isn't always easy finding a resto that strikes the balance between good food and service, so sometimes one might be willing to overlook the other because it performs so well in one of those 2 categories. Cafe Beaufort unfortunately has outdone itself in the poor service category, so for that reason I gave it 2 stars for the food and will not be going back or ever recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"Une petite terrasse apréciable en été et une salle très sympathique. 
Des plats très bons, j'ai pris la salade repas. Très copieuse et très bonne et des produits frais!

Je recommande!"}
{"text":"This is a really nice café at St Zotique and St Denis. The interior is very pleasing, the service friendly, and the food good. One small complaint is that the veggie burger completely fell apart as I was eating it -- I would not order it again. But the fries and salad were really great. Will definitely be going back to try other stuff on the menu!"}
{"text":"After visiting the marche, we stumbled upon this place looking for breakfast/brunch. We ordered randomly from the menu the Norwegian croissant and casserole and were completely surprised. The eggs were perfectly herbed and seasoned, the fruits were brightly fresh, the toast and croissants were buttery, and the salmon was flavorful. Along with the artful presentation and fantastic service, this little cafe was a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Accueil A+ et chaleureuse ambiance, staff sympatique, repas parfait et très belle présentation de mon plat....j'y aurais passé la journée...mais je dois partir:(."}
{"text":"Very good. Little gem in neighborhood.

Pros:
Food seems to be fresh... must try the octopus dish, was amazing... same with the calamari poutine...good for night with friends

Cons:
Not cheapest place either... some appetizers are over priced ($11 for one arrancini)... moderate noise level

All in all, will come back again!"}
{"text":"Spent the whole evening there. On a freezing january tuesday, the ambiance was hot and lively, the crowd was coming in, the plate were flying out the kitchen, all in all had a great time and great food, as always! Can't wait to come back !!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes based on reviews. Service awful - basically ignored. Ordered an omelette with cheese and bacon. After a long wait. Dish came out with no bacon or cheese. Really?? Unless you want to wait a long time,
for mediocre everything. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"J'y suis allée à 2 reprises. Le gravlax et la poutine aux boulettes suédoises valent quelque chose. Un peu cher mais vaut le déplacement"}
{"text":"C'est acceptable, mais pas exceptionnelle. Dejeuner correct. La poutine dejeuner est interessante!"}
{"text":"I discovered Beaufort Café with my friends by accident. The other cafe we wanted to go was packed so we decided to grab a seat in a nearby cafe in the meanwhile.

It turned out to be a cute cafe to grab brunch in my opinion. The menu has quite a bit selection of dishes ranging from smorebrod to burgers, from welsh rarebit to poutine. It was my first time in a Norwegian cafe and I didn't know what to order.. I settled my mind of their Calamari poutine because it was the first time I see this combination. Plus, I couldn't decide between getting a poutine or calamari, so this was the perfect dish for me to order!

The calamari came with a tartar sauce was well-seasoned (wasn't too sweet and it was perfect with the calamari). I didn't quite like the calamari since they weren't chewy (they were on the softer end and I prefer having chewier/bouncier calamari).

The poutine fries were homemade, the gravy was really good (not too salty). The gravy is really important since it is the \"essence\" of poutine; it is what makes a poutine good or bad. In this case, I loved it! The cheese \"cubes\" used weren't the traditional ones you find in typical poutine: cheese curd. The one at Beaufort Café tasted more like strong parmesan cheese. At first, I thought I wouldn't like it because I like my poutine with cheese curds but surprisingly, I enjoyed my poutine a lot! The green onions added a little touch of originality and asianess! :P

I will be back to try more stuff on their menu! The service was really friendly which is a plus for this café!"}
{"text":"L'ambiance est conviviale , le staff en sympathique et donne des bons conseils pour les accords mets et vins. La pieuvre est un must et il y a un bon choix végétarien et vegan.
Je recommande à tous !"}
{"text":"The food is great, it matches the prices, but the service is crap. 

First time we went to Beaufort was in lunch time and we both ordered hot-dogs that took them 45min to bring us which we're not happy about it, but we decided to give another chance. Today, we tried their breakfast and honestly I felt personally insulted by their lack of attention towards our table. We spent 20min trying to pay our bill then we had to put our coats on and go over the counter to pay it and the guy at the cash register acted like we were invisible. I was literally staring at him to get his attention and he completely ignored my presence to the point that I had to be a bit rude. \"Look, we just want to pay\". Giving two starts because I believe service is half of a restaurant experience. Again, the food is exceptional."}
{"text":"Nice decor, all in wood and big tables, warm and welcoming.
The staff is friendly and accomodating and the brunch hours run so late, you can decide to stay in bed nearly all day.
We opted for the norwegian breakfast (replacing the croissant with a bagel) and the vegetarian chili. The salmon on the breakfast was very good and fresh, the fruit a nice addition though the fried potatoes unnecessary. The chili was good but really too small. It was 12$ for a small bowl so I was still very hungry afterwards.
The orange juice was delicious but bad points for the hot chocolate which lacked hotness and... chocolate. I received a barely warm glass of milk with a few drops of powder chocolate on top... for 4$! I know I have high expectations when it comes to anything chocolate but, I would have liked to at least have the taste of it!"}
{"text":"Really interesting and yummy breakfast. Charming little cafe with good service. I'll be going back!"}

{"text":"Was recommended this place by a colleague for something different but not too heavy, and I was thanking her profusely the next day! My friend had norwegian meatballs, and I had a trio of toasts with different garnishes: the first with an eggplant puree, roasted red peppers and goat cheese; the second with zucchini and fried scallop, and the third with spicy salami, asparagus, and blue cheese. It was totally unreal!! 

While the food was a major plus, there were a few cons: the a/c was either not working or not existant. It was unbearably hot, and we felt like we were suffocating. The water was warm, so it wasn't even refreshing. Also the time between getting our bills and the server coming back with the machine was nearly 20 minutes. Service was otherwise great, but when you want to leave it's the worst time to slip up."}
{"text":"Get the beef tartar. After flying in from Reykjavik I was taken to this place and absolutely amazed. Great service and good food still exists and its here. I caught a glimpse of the staff inspecting the silverware for water stains before placing them on the table which made me super happy."}
{"text":"Really nice food, from the bits of smoresbord and salad and scone we tried. The latte I had didn't particularly do it for me, kinda weak, didn't finish it. But I love the vibe here - big wood tables, warm lighting, open spaces, lots of folks on laptops and no feeling of rush. I'd come back for a beer and snack with a computer for some soothing and well-fuelled clickety clack."}
{"text":"I almost decided to give this place three stars. Not because it was bad, but more because it wasn't really exceptional. So I'll grudgingly give it  4 stars, because I think that maybe I just didn't order the best thing on the menu.

I went at 6 PM on a Friday night. It wasn't super busy, which was nice. I had the poutine with meatballs. The meatballs were tasty and I like that they went with a sharp cheddar cheese instead of cheese curds... but the gravy was missing something, and the fries were good but not great. I had a latte and it too was so-so.

On the other hand, the atmosphere is pleasant and the waitstaff was nice. I also had a good view of all the food that was coming out of the kitchen and everything at least looked really delicious."}
{"text":"I came here for a drink but either they didn't understand me or they don't serve alcohol in the am, so I got a cafe americano, which was really good. the food seemed interesting."}
{"text":"Un endroit chaleureux et sympathique pour prendre une bouchée. 

Plusieurs types de plats disponibles; salades, poisson, viande, etc.

Il est possible de prendre juste un café dessert également."}
{"text":"Years ago, this place used to be a Scandinavian café that I loved. Then it closed and I was so sore at Beaufort.Turns out, they have kept some Nordic dishes (meatballs, gravlax, smorrebrod) but broadened the offerings. The decor is a bit darker then it used to be, which is too bad, but then they added some tables on the sidewalk which is pretty awesome when the weather is good! It's still a lovely, airy, neigbourhood café.

The menu is simple and under $20. There is a table d'hote if you're feeling fancy, and it includes an appetizer, a main dish, and a coffee (no dessert!). I got the gravlax plate, served with a very sauced up salad. It doesn't look like much, but it is very filling, the salmon is super fat - in the best way. The meatballs are also deceptive, you only get 3, but they are heavy, and actually spicy! Only con: service is a bt slow. I should hang out there more!"}
{"text":"We found this place while wandering around looking for somewhere to eat dinner. I kept checking my Yelp app. and realised that most restaurants in the neighbourhood seemed to be closed on Mondays. To be honest, we didn't really have high expectations as Scandinavian food usually isn't something we'd choose. We decided to give it a try mostly because we were hungry and didn't hold out much hope of finding something else open close by.

We were seated right away and brought menus. We ordered calamari (they forgot about that order, so we didn't actually get it) and 2 kinds of tartare. We also ordered a bottle of wine which was no longer available but the waiter offered another in its place (sauvignon blanc) and it was delicious. Our son ordered a cola from the menu which was also no longer available, but was brought a local cola instead and he loved it so much that we messaged the company to ask where we can buy it.

My son and I each had the beef tartare. He had it mild and I had it spicy. It was served with a few slices of crisp, grilled bread, salad and frites on the side. The tartare was delicious and perfectly seasoned. The salad was made from mixed greens, radish, cucumber and tomato and the dressing was perfectly balanced. The frites were the best we've had in Montréal (we've been here for a week and have tried many). 

My husband had the salmon tartare, which was also perfectly seasoned and he agreed that the salad and frites were wonderful.

The prices were very reasonable and the serving sizes were generous.

The waiter and waitress who served us were friendly and efficient.

All in all, this was a great experience and we'd definitely be back if weren't leaving Montréal tomorrow."}
{"text":"Très très chouette restaurant, j'ai adoré le repas du début à la fin. Service parfait, belle présentation, très bon repas !
Foncez-y !"}
{"text":"A lovely and casual local gem. Simple food. Simply prepared. Very good. Many dejeuner items with their specialty gravalox.  A few good bieres on tap and excellent coffee.  Very satisfying and delicious brunch spot."}
{"text":"Une amie et moi nous y sommes arrêtées pour le lunch. En raison de la pluie, nous ne pûmes profiter de la terrasse. Le décors intérieur nous a tout de suite plu, serein et chaleureux à la fois ! 
Le staff nous a bien expliqué les différentes options du menu et nous avons eu un excellent service malgré le petit oubli de la seconde ronde de pain (qui accompagnait le plat principal de mon amie). 
J'y retournerai avec plaisir pour y déguster un café, qui y est très bon et fort à souhait."}
{"text":"Nouveau quartier nouveau challenge : dénicher les bonnes adresses pour bruncher.
Je suis passée plusieurs fois devant Beaufort, et c'était toujours bondé, bon signe ?

Nous voilà attablés face à la cuisine ouverte sur la salle, de grandes ardoises où sont listés des plats aux connotations nordiques : saumon gravlax, welsh, croissant norvégien... Miam, un peu de changement !

J'ai du coup pris le welsh déjeuner : pain nordique trempé dans la bière brune, sauce au bleu, uf au plat et fruits confis. Une explosion de saveur ! Mon chéri a pris la poutine déjeuner : patates rôties, cheddar vieilli, sauce welsh (bière brune, crème et moutarde de dijou) sur laquelle trône un oeuf poché.

Des plats vraiment originaux, très beaux et plein de saveurs. Le service est très rapide et très chaleureux et pour finir en beauté, les prix sont très correct.

Ah, sans oublier que Beaufort ne propose pas de café filtre, mais une belle sélection de café : americano, latté, chaï... pour tous les goûts.

Je recommande fortement cet endroit, même si j'aimerais le garder pour moi !"}
{"text":"Great ambiance! Waitress was very sweet and efficient. Food was good. Especially their poutine.  Not your ordinary type poutine so i love it."}
{"text":"Une place où on se sent bien et où on mange très bien !
Service au top, grand choix de speciaux.
Ce sont des plats bien réalisés. 
Je suis triste de ne pas l'avoir connu avant ;)"}
{"text":"Des plats authentiques et savoureux, avec de bons légumes de saison : smorrebrod, boulettes norvégiennes, gravlax... 
J'ai beaucoup aimé l'ambiance resto à l'avant, et un peu plus \"café\" à l'arrière.
Il y a aussi une belle terrasse pour profiter du soleil. J'y retournerai pour essayer leur menu brunch, qui a l'air tout aussi alléchant !"}
