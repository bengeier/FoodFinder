{"text":"After hearing a lot of praise about this place, we finally got to try it out last night!  We started off with a couple appetizers. The first (don't remember what it was called) was like a pulled pork egg roll. It was SO good! The burnt ends were also great. They were really tender, juicy, and had a beautiful crust. Probably the best burnt ends I've ever had.   My husband got the pulled pork and I got the brisket. I thought the brisket was a tad dry, but still flavorful. The pulled pork was excellent, moist and delicious. Both entrees had very generous portions of meat. They have 6 sauces on the table in squeeze bottles, as someone mentioned, it's like what Famous Daves did. I thought the sauces were really good. Nice variety between mild and hot.   The sides were awesome, awesome, awesome. The sweet potato casserole was different but good. The sweet potato was kind of like spaghetti squash. It made the casserole have a great texture, not mushy. Had some nuts in it, too. The green beans tasted like what my great-grandma used to make. Cooked with bacon. Mmmm! Baked beans had good sized chunks of meat in them, pretty tangy and spicy. The mac n cheese was good and creamy. Might need a dash of salt and pepper, but I think that's more of a personal preference. I think I like salt too much! haha  Something that I always look at is the bathrooms. I think clean bathrooms are kind of an indicator of how attentive a restaurant is. Luckily, their bathrooms were extremely clean. Good job there!  Our waitress was good. Kept our drinks full. She was really friendly and cheery. My only complaint is that she waited a bit too long to pick up our dirty dishes.  After dinner we moved to the bar and had a couple more beers. The bartender was friendly, attentive.   Overall, I think the place is well-decorated and clean. We had good service from everyone. The food was good, too. It's worth giving it a shot!"}
{"text":"Just to preface, this is my first review, but I specifically signed up for Yelp so I could write a review for Smoke. That's how my experience went. Let's start at the beginning.  My parents and I ate there on 12/16 after an Illini Basketball game. It was each of our first times there. We thought the place would be extremely crowded but it was only about half to 60% full. When we walked in the first employee I saw was as bus boy that had giant headphones on his cheeks, not any sort of kind they would ever use to tell him what tables to clean or anything, and had his pants well below his waist. This surprised me greatly because the decor and feel of the place made it seem like it would have a lot of class. We were seated promptly and the transition from sitting to getting or drinks was normal. The real fun began when we ordered. My dad asked our waiter (don't remember his name, lucky for him probably) about the cornbread because the menu said it was $1 for extra cornbread. So dad asked him if each table got one loaf or what the deal was. He said that yes each table got one loaf of bread.  Soon thereafter he returned and said something to the effect of, \"Well the kitchen made a liar out of me. They burnt the last batch of cornbread and the next batch won't be ready for another 25 minutes. So here are some [3] $2 off coupons for use next time, or tonight if you want.\" I thought this was probably a reasonable deal, although them letting us get something other would have been nice too (ended up still hungry).   When we were about 90% done with our meals my dad mentioned that he might still like some cornbread and it would surely be done by now (it had to have been at least 40 minutes later, long after the 25 minute cornbread threshold). So once our waiter finally returned to our table...  Sidebar: The three of us never once got a refill or an offer for one, good thing we're slow drinkers.  ...my dad asked him if we could possibly get the cornbread now, as we would still like to try it. The waiter said that he would go check to see if it was done and let us know. He went to the kitchen and returned promptly, only to walk by our table twice without even giving a glance. Finally, he stopped and let us know that, \"They said it'll still be a couple minutes.\" Mind you, the reader, this was absolutely at least 40 minutes after he said \"25 minutes\". At this point, as we were all a bit perturbed, I began to become a little suspicious. So, I just stood up next to our table and glanced at the booth behind us. There sat a loaf of cornbread. I chalked that up to possibly the people being there before us. However, I then looked over at the bar and saw that there was someone's empty plates, including an empty bread server. Once again, this could have been that the people got there before us/before the great cornbread burning of 2012. At this point we were ready to leave, so I told my parents that I would meet them at the car, as I wanted to investigate. In my investigation I saw that literally every single table/bar setting had a loaf of cornbread. This included the people that were seated immediately before us when we arrived. In fact, they had two loaves. If the waiter had not been out of the common area at this point, I would have given him my three cents.  Now, I realize most of this was about my family not getting a free loaf of cornbread. But it is not the cornbread, but the idea of it. Our waiter consciously deceived us repeatedly. I have no doubt that once he gave us the coupons, he was not going to give us bread. In doing so, I suppose he did save about 50 cents or whatever a loaf of cornbread costs them. However, if he had thought about it whatsoever, he might have realized that in fact he was costing the restaurant money. The three of us will not return there, we would have otherwise, thus costing the restaurant any chance of ever gaining our business, or that of people we know. Moreover, had the cornbread not even been an issue, we probably still would have not returned due to his complete and total ineptitude or laziness.   All that being said, the sauces are really good, my pulled chicken sandwich was solid, along with great Mac and Cheese, although portion sizes left some to be desired (cornbread might have solved that...) We will be taking our business to Black Dog or Hickory River next time. I hope Smoke survives, but I don't see it happening."}
{"text":"Let me just say start by saying this, there are a lot of BBQ places in Champaign so if I were you I would go to one of them instead of this place.   For starters the atmosphere here is just awkward. It's like someone took a failed korean restaurant, put up a couple signs that say jack daniels on it and called it a bbq joint. Maybe the fact that the music was so low we couldn't here it and also that we were the only ones in the place is what made it so uncomfortable but yeah... def awkward.  2nd... The management here is simply outrageous. We walked in and the manager is at the door and she's wearing clothes that make her look like she's going to the club! TURN UP THE BEATS!! lol... I just didn't understand why since the rest of the staff was wearing jeans and a very worn BROWN shirt... She was the one whom sat us and when we asked her about a couple menu items she didn't have a clue (we later found out she was actually the owner lol) She referred us to our server. (who also wasn't sure what brisket was)  SERVICE... Point blank there was none. I don't remember our servers name probably because she came to the table 3 times... once to take our order, once to drop off our food, and once to drop off our check.... We asked the manager/owner if we could get a refill and she just told us that it was our servers job?... So no we never got one lol  NOW THE FOOD! We started with the pulled pork egg roll app which sounded like it would be very ummm interesting and well thats pretty much the only words I can use to describe it. Maybe it was a recipe from the old korean place from before? I wouldn't really recommend. I ordered the Brisket and my friend ordered the pulled pork. Both were very moist which I give the chef credit for that. The flavor though was just not there. The GM came up and asked how things were and we were honest and said the flavor wasn't there and this is his response \"People in the midwest don't have a pallet so we try and make our flavor pretty generic\" THERE YOU HAVE IT! GENERIC BBQ STRAIGHT FROM THE HORSES MOUTH.  I don't mean to slam the place I just think money is spent better elsewhere. Black Dog, Porgys, Boneyard, Hickory River, Oh and theres a new place opening up down town!! Good Luck!!"}
{"text":"This was our first experience at Smoke 'Que, and we will definitely be back! The experience was not perfect (our son's burger was raw in the middle), but overall it was a great meal! The burnt edges for an appetizer were perfect! The meat in our dinner platters was very juicy and flavorful! The sides were delicious; the fries don't look the greatest, but they are delicious!! The 6-pack of BBQ sauces are nice to try and some are very good! But, one of the best parts of the meal was dessert! We ordered the beignets, and they were very yummy!!! Overall, the service was good and well-informed of the food, the atmosphere was very nice (loved the jazz music), bathrooms were very clean, and lastly the food was delicious!!! A great addition to Champaign!!"}
{"text":"We gave Smoke another chance tonight (Friday dinner) and our experience was a complete 180 from the first time.  I had the meatloaf with fries and cole slaw and my husband had the half chicken dinner with fries and corn.  The meatloaf was moist and the portion was well worth the price.  The char on the meat gave it a crispy exterior which was unlike any meatloaf I've had before.  The slaw was delicious...be aware that it's Carolina cole slaw so it's vinegar-based, not mayo-based.  The dressing was just the right combination of sweet and tart.  The skin on the chicken was crispy and had a nice smoky flavor.  The corn (one of our big issues from the first visit) was completely different...definitely fresh off the cob, not canned.  It had an amazing flavor.  We also tried the Pulled Pork Crisps appetizer and it was so delicious.  We finished with the Chocolate Chip Cookie a la mode for dessert and it was so good...it literally melted in my mouth.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  The only (minor) issues we had this time were 1) the cornbread was a little dry, and 2) my sweet tea still wasn't very sweet, but it was okay.  I read in another review that the cornbread used to have pieces of corn in it...I think it would be great to go back to that recipe.  We've changed our minds about Smoke...we'll be back."}
{"text":"The first time I tried this place, I would have given it one star based on the service.  Our server took our order, delivered our food and disappeared until she brought the bill.  However, upon the suggestion of a friend, I went back for dinner, and I was glad I did.  The second and subsequent times, the service has been night and day from that original experience.  The service has been generally attentive, and the food always delicious.  In comparison to the other BBQ places in town, the meat is about average or on par with them.  The sides here, though, tend to be much better.  I think the beer selection is pretty good, and the value for the money when compared to other places is about the same.  I find the prices for the ribs and burgers to be too high, though, so I haven't tried them.  (For instance, the burgers tend to charge about $1.00 for each additional topping, which to me is way too expensive).  Overall, I think it's well worth the trip out, and after four visits, I've never had a bad meal!"}
{"text":"I took my wife and 4 kids here last night. Service was friendly and helpful. Food was quite tasty. I had a 1/2 rack of pork ribs which was huge and very good with the at-table sauces. Sides were quite good too. The bar area looks like a nice place for individuals or a couple friends to sit. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"What a surprise. A bit hard to find, but well worth the visit. Smoke is not like the typical BBQ place. Instead of standing in line at a counter, you relax in a booth or table and get waited on. Staff is very attentive, food is nicely smoked and the side dishes are actually another surprise. I got good value, enjoyed the time I was there, and will plan a return."}
{"text":"If Yelp let me give half-stars, Smoke would get a 3.5. Alas, I can't in good conscience give a four-star rating for the experience. Mr. Husband, a friend of ours, and I wanted to go out for dinner on Saturday, but wanted to stay away from downtown Champaign due to Ebertfest/Marathon madness. We figured the Crossing would be safe enough. Debated going to Billy Barooz, but ultimately settled on trying out Smoke 'Que & Brew.  Service: We were greeted pleasantly enough by the hostess. We were told that it would be a 15 minute wait. That's fine, but there were clearly empty tables in view, which leads me to think they were understaffed. At dinner. On a Saturday. Sometimes people call off, and it can't be helped, but it seemed a little odd. We were seated about fifteen minutes later, and our server was helpful. A little forgetful, but her section was indeed busy, so I can understand why. Food: I have mixed feelings. Some things were REALLY good, others were completely mediocre. Mr. Husband and I shared the chicken wings for an appetizer. These were absolutely wonderful. The chicken was crispy and delicious, and I liked being able to sauce them at the table. The waitress brought us a small loaf of cornbread to share, which was tasty. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich, with macaroni & cheese and green beans with bacon. The sandwich was totally mediocre, which is disappointing for a barbecue place! The meat was soooo dry that I had to heavily sauce by the bite, and the bun looked nice, but was also dry and didn't add much to the sandwich. The mac & cheese had a nice cheddar taste. I was fine with it. The green beans were also fine, despite the rubbery bacon. I will say, I tried a couple of my friend's french fries, and those were quite good. Mr. Husband liked his meatloaf, and said if he were writing this, he'd definitely give it a 4 (he's nicer than I am, though!). Prices were fair. The sandwich, I believe, was $7.50 with 2 sides. The wings were $4.99. I believe our bill (for 3 entrees/sandwiches, one iced tea, and the wings app) was around $32-34.  Smoke hasn't been open that long, so perhaps they're ironing out some of the issues. I'm willing to give them another try. If I come back, I'm getting wings and fries - which might bump this up to a four-star. I hear their nachos are good, too. Nothing about my overall experience was upsetting - I think my issue is with a barbecue place having mediocre barbecue. Bottom line: Try Smoke 'Que & Brew for the wings, fries, nachos, etc, but for a good pulled pork sandwich in the C-U area, go to Black Dog."}
{"text":"I tried the chicken crisps last night and while I thought they were good I did not think they were as good as the nachos.  I still really like the nachos with pulled pork.  I was also told that they now serve them with the brisket so I will have to try that the next time we go.    We sat outside since the weather was so beautiful and the service was great.  This is still one of my favorite places to go to."}
{"text":"I came here with a lot of expectations, but it really fell short. This is a bit of a nicer sit-down compared to the usual barbecue places I go to in Champaign-Urbana, but the food quality was just okay. Nothing really stood out and the servers took an extremely long time to attend to us. It probably took around 25-30 minutes before we started eating. I would suggest Black Dog or Lil Porgy's, which is probably my favorite."}
{"text":"Went for the first time today around one pm. Waited at the hostess station for 5 min. No one came. Decided to sit at the bar. Waited 5 min. No one came. I guess they did not hear the IL marathon was in town. No hostess, no bartender, there were about a hundred customers and 5 staff. A server finally took my order at the bar. Now the good news. The food was great! The Burnt Ends were so good you did not even need sauce. The server who finally saw me did a good job. I think she was also cooking and doing the dishes."}
{"text":"Was referred here by family. Located in south west Champaign in upscale retail area. The smoke was immediately evident in the parking lot. Upon entering is a clean forward appearance of a nice modern atmosphere uncluttered to the eye. Large bar area in the centerand plenty of restaurant seating. Blues music and several flatscreens. Straight forward Bbq menu with the standards with a noteable exception .... Bbq meatloaf! Will come back for that!. Had a Bbq pork sandwich southern style with slaw and pickle, baked beans, and sweet potato casserole. A loaf of cornbread comes with drink order. Pieces of corn it it. Everything was excellent and sweet potato casserole included pecans. 6 different sauces on the table. True hickory smoked meat and pieces in the beans. Darrell, wife Chow and Ken have a winner here. Just GO!"}
{"text":"It's a fine place, the food tastes good.  Nothing too terribly exciting though"}
{"text":"I have been to Smoke 'Que & Brew multiple times now.  I love that it is close to my house.  The interior is very well decorated and very clean.  All of the waiters/waitresses that i've had were very attentive and nice.  I've tried quite a few different things on the menu and I can't complain about any of them. (wings, burnt ends, brisket, pulled pork, meatloaf, fries, mac n cheese, potatoe salad, bbq beans)  I really like that they have the different BBQ sauces available on the table.  I recommend this place a lot and I will definitely be there again sometime in the near future!"}
{"text":"Friendly wait staff and reasonably priced food. Pulled pork was awesome and I will be the 2nd person to write a review saying the brisket was dry... It was dry:) all 6 of their sauces had tons of flavor and the 6 pack beer box they put it in they borrowed the idea from famous Dave's. I had 3 of their side dishes, fries and the Cole slaw were good while the potato salad was not and I could not eat 2 bites it tasted store bought and bland."}
{"text":"service was great.  food portions were just about right for the price.  the establishment was nice and even though I'm not big on BBQ, I'd likely go back if I'm in the mood and/or friends wanted to check it out."}
{"text":"It's decent, nothing great. Both times we have gone here he have had a coupon and honestly I would say that's the only time I would go. I had a sweet potatoe as one of my sides and it came out soaked. I asked if it was butter and they said no just olive oil, but still it was kind of gross. Meat is pretty good and atmosphere good if you want to watch a game. No honey for cornbread ...who does this ? :)"}
{"text":"It's really great to see a restaurant improve over time.  My first visit last winter did not impress, but returned today and the food and service were great.  Three of us had a brisket and blue cheese salad, and a pork taco app.  Salad was fresh, brisket was tender and plentiful, and price only $10.  The menu is short, and well focused with burgers, 'cue, a couple sandwich options and grilled salmon.  To rate five stars, they need to find some WOW items to work into the menu.  I was also surprised there was no smoked hot link, turkey breast, or greens.  Until then, I'm more than happy to work my way through their existing menu.  They're definitely on the right track."}
{"text":"There were a few issues with my experience here, but the food was really good and the portions were EXTREMELY generous for the prices.  The main problem was that my salad was missing TWO ingredients--it came without the toasted pecans and toasted baguette.  Our waitress took a while to check in and I had to flag her down to ask about it.  She came back a minute or two later with the missing components, but the baguette slices weren't toasted.  I didn't bother complaining about that, because I really just wanted to eat my salad.  But it's pretty lame that it somehow made it out of the kitchen missing two ingredients.  I thought the salad was really delicious, but it seemed like it was missing...something (other than the things I knew it was missing when I first got it).  I think it would have been perfect if the pecans had been candied or something.  Just a little extra sweetness would have made it a truly excellent salad (I had the Romaine & Bleu salad).  Nonetheless, it was super tasty and the bleu cheese was delicious.  I don't usually eat bleu cheese...ever...but the fact that it's from a local farm intrigued me and I'm glad I tried it.  Good stuff.    Also, it was so huge that I only ate about half of it, had to take the rest to-go.  The wings appetizer was really tasty and I tried my boyfriend's side dishes (sweet potato casserole and fries) and both were soooo good.  He had a 1/3 rack of ribs, which was a solid 4 ribs, and he thought it was good.  He said there were just a few sections of meat that were kind of strange in texture (\"mushy\"), but otherwise he was really impressed by the flavor.  So, there were a few things that weren't perfect about this experience, but I thought the food was really good overall and I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Well I just got back from my first and last dinning experience from Smoke 'Que & Brew. They have pretty decent prices and a nice roomy atmosphere. Overall it felt like Hickory River met Famous Dave and started a restaurant.   My wife got the pulled pork sandwich and I got the smoked and flash fried chicken. When I opened up the chicken it was under cooked and bloody. I had to wipe the blood off of my fork! The waitress agreed and went back to the kitchen for a new plate. She came back out and said the cooks were making me a new plate but that is how the \"smoked chicken\" is supposed to be. I'm not sure who lied, her or the cooks? that chicken was under cooked. The new plate was cooked properly.   I guess the manager didn't want to bother with the situation, but he did check to make sure the ticket money was in the book before we even walked out the door. This really wrapped up the whole experience for me."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Been there 4 or 5 times since it open, good service, love the sauces.  All the sauce are on the table for you to try."}
{"text":"I've tried smoke twice now and have both times really enjoyed it. The inside Is nice, and has a full bar with some flat screens scattered throughout. Also a larger room off to the side to house larger groups.   The food was also a nice surprise. Since I visited Kansas city, the BBQ bar has been raised.. And was excited to notice they serve burnt ends. If you havent tried burnt ends they are off the brisket and smoke twice to get a nice crust and melt in your mouth.   The sides are also great, a loaf of cornbread brought after you order, and all the sauces in squeeze bottles for you to try out.  Also a nice on tap beer selection, which I found one of my new fav beers, rogue dead guy.. Strongly recommend if you like fat tire.  Not sure about the other review not liking the fries and brisket And pork here. The fries were awesome last time I went, and the meat has been perfect.   Would strongly recommend you give this place a try for yourself!"}
