{"text":"Kind of surprised to even see this place on Yelp. It's nothing special. Seems like the mini mall just needed a place for staff to eat. Service is awkward, donairs are okay. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"For as much as you pay, you're better off going somewhere else. Food is sub-par at best."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and affordable. My hubby will not have a donair anywhere else but here! They bring you your food to the table and clean up for you, the place is very public and is clean."}
{"text":"The Beef Donair is hot with a nice blend of sweet and heat. I was a little hesitant to buy a Donair from a mall, but given the options around here - I have no regrets."}
{"text":"Seriously the best place for donairs. Service is awesome! Ive been here  several times, but yesterday's visit wasn't so plesent. My boyfriend and i got food poisoning from the donairs there!! I absolutely love this place but wont be back for a long time."}
{"text":"Here is a fast food restaurant in Beddington Mall that gives you exactly what the name says: choices.  I was surprised after reading the menu of all the different things they offered.  I'll start with Vietnamese subs.  Now there's something you don't see every day in a mall.  They also served burgers and wraps, as well as bubble tea and coffee.  This place really does have it all.  I was surprised at the prices of Choices.  Everything seemed to be really cheap for what they were offering.  The subs were only $6 a piece, and each burger was about $5.  It took me a while to decide on what to eat since everything sounded delicious and seemed so affordable.  They have a large location with plenty of seating to enjoy your food at.  The place is extremely bright which makes it very welcoming and inviting.  Next time I'm in Beddington Mall and in need of some sustenance, I'm going to Choice so I can have my choice."}
{"text":"Nice, quiet, environment. I have tried bubble tea from there, and honestly it wasn't something I would go back for. BUT I did see some other snacks that I may try next time I go around there."}
