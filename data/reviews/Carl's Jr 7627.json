{"text":"Personally I had a great burger, unfortunately my boyfriend had a much worse experience. He got his \"burger\" and received lettuce in a bun with no hamburger patty. It was pretty funny to me, but he's still mad."}
{"text":"Horrible drive threw service. They are always out of food and the wait time feels like forever. They forgot most of my order half the time and had to go back to get and they wanted to give me the old stuff instead of making it new. Then when we talk to the manager she didn't even care just said \"ok\" a lot."}
{"text":"My son and I like this place.  This place just to have better than the other places around here.  That is why we keep coming back.  Plus, the shakes are awesome!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Jim Beam burger and sweet potato fries oh my so very good love this place and the best part they are going to have the biscuts like Hardees"}
{"text":"Simply aweful. It took 15 minutes to get thru drived thru. The order was screwed up and dry. Could not eat it was so bad. I will never return to this location. I'd give negative stars if I could."}
{"text":"I don't care who says Carl's is the least healthy fast food place. Their double western burger, and criss-cut fries are legit! I hate going into a fast food place and them giving me stale ice tea, but this location nailed it with a fresh batch.

Food came out fresh and fast, and my order was correct. What else can you ask for out of a fast food place?"}
{"text":"Good burger and fish. Got my free Burger for my blood donation in August. Clean place with friendly staff."}
{"text":"Good was good. Service was fast. Staff was pretty friendly and attentive. Went back again through the drive thru and experienced the same."}
