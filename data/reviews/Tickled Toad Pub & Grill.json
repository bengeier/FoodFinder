{"text":"The toad is OK....   Food is average, and the service was friendly but a tiny slow. There is a patio, which is nice if you want a view of the parking lot.....  Inside is rather large and clean. I have never been at the Toad when it is busy.   I would not go here if you were on a first date...... but if you are a York U student on a budget this works just great."}
{"text":"Food is below average. The nachos are really bad. It honestly looked like they put some cheese and jalapenos on some tortilla chips and microwaved it.  The fajitas are a bit better, but still nothing I would be bragging about.  Tickled Toad would be ok place to have a beer, watch a game, or play darts, but that is about it. They have a nice dart board. Staff is also nice, and they have free parking"}
{"text":"the Toronto Lover system: 5 stars = Must visit! 4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here. 3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go. 2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary. 1 star = Do not visit!     There are many things to love about the Toad, but what brings most people to this place is the fact that it's the only bar in the neighbourhood. For what it's worth, it has the feel of a Bathurst/Steeles Cheers. For real flavour, sit near the bar at the north end where the regulars drink beer and eat wings. If you're with a group, grab a booth at the other end and watch a leafs game. The patio is great, considering it's a bar that overlooks Steeles Avenue. The best deals are Wing nights on Mondays. The service is usually very good and friendly. This is one of those places where you will get pretty much what you expect.  3 stars"}
{"text":"Food: Portion size is solid, food quality itself varies based on what you order unfortunately.  Some meals taste reheated while some taste freshly made. Look at the daily specials if you want to maximize value ! I personally recommend burger day,  Service: Service isn't great, but not terrible either. It's what you would expect for a bar/pub.   Decor: Slightly dated some could say but for me I appreciated it as it added to the environment."}
{"text":"Great place with friendly crowd and staff. Very spacious and clean. I like l."}
{"text":"My friends have dragged me here more than once because it was a local for them growing up and the place has a cheap wings night. I once went here in the winter and the took absolutely forever to bring us our wings and fries. Once they brought them we noticed that the food was stone cold. The server's excuse when we called them over was that \"the kitchen isn't heated and it is cold in the there.\" (That makes no sense because unless the food sat there for a while if it had just been cooked it wouldn't get cold that quickly).  I went there again last week and while the food wasn't cold this time I experienced other issues. I was really hungry when we got there so I ordered an appetizer - a Beef Tostada - figuring that it would come before the pound of wings I ordered as well. I waited and waited and waiter some more. Finally, they brought me my appetizer and a minute later they brought my friends' wings... but mine were nowhere to be found. (They clearly fail to understand the concept of the appetizer and how it is to come BEFORE the main dish.) I waited for the server to wander back over and asked her where my wings were. She expressed regret for screwing up the order and rushed to fill it. I got my wings when my friends were about halfway done theirs and , thankfully, they were cooked and hot. When we finished eating and drinking we looked around for the server and she was nowhere to be found. We waited and waited and waited and after a good 10 minutes she finally reappeared (we hadn't seen her the entire meal either so it had been quite a while since she checked on her table). We noticed on the bill that they had graciously added a tip in for us (probably because we were a group of eight) and yet, there was no mention of this practice on the menu (that I saw, and that I see on their website) and the server made no effort whatsoever to draw attention to it.  All in all, if you live near Steeles between Bathurst & Yonge and have nowhere else to go I understand why you'd come here. Aside from that, keep away."}
{"text":"Great local, great food, staff are amazing, lots of parking. Food is always fresh, staff attentive. Great selection of brews and wine. Come for the atmosphere. Martinis and fries are great- ya not together but in its own!"}
{"text":"The staff took forever to serve cause she was talking to people at the bar. She was nice but did not really care  for Her lousy service. We ordered a pizza and cheese sticks. Pizza was horrible literally tasted like frozen pizza from the grocery store. Pepperoni was cold. We had cheesesticks for 7.49 and came out with 9 sticks the size of my pinky. Deffenitly not worth it. All in all I will never return to this place again !"}
{"text":"My favourite neighbourhood bar. Still the same as it was for the past 20 years. It's not the glamorous bar downtown, this is the classic pub where you can expect to see familiar faces after a long workday.    Food selection is pretty decent, every day specials. Wing day on Monday all day, even lunch time  Never had a bad pint. Beer taps always cold and clean.  Bar staff is same for a while, not much turnover, which is good.   I hope this place stays open for as long as possible."}
{"text":"Not as bad as most reviewers say.  This is an old school style pub.  Large bar area.  One of the few bars around that actually still has a pool table and a dart board, although there in crappy condition.  Good selection of beers, even added a Hops Bolt.  The food is actually half decent, although I wouldn't choose this place for dinner.  Needs to be fixed up it's starting to look very dated."}
{"text":"Many years ago, although not sure if the business opener changed hands, this was the go to location for cheapie Tuesday wing night with the purchase of a drink. My friend and I returned on a Saturday night to watch some of the Leafs-Canadiens game and enjoy some IPA while having a good plate of Pub Grub.   This is a place where everyone knows your name if you come back enough times. This was obvious with the bar folks enjoying the evening throwing back whiskey in between the frequent outdoor smokes. It's a clear bar with big bar stools and clearly written specials on chalkboards both inside and out. The aroma of fresh fries and cigarette smoke is a throwback for sure, but the place has obvious updates to appease the millennials playing $2.00 games of pool in the dining area.   For about $12 bucks, you can enjoy a good Louisiana Chicken sandwich and a mess of crispy fries with an extra few dollars for a delicious dark IPA. How can you not enjoy both the food and atmosphere which I'm sure has a lot of stories to tell.  Just don't expect the most attentive service, as it appears like they do double and triple duties as bussing, cleaning, tending bar and serving. Be patient with the folks and show the, a smile, and you'll get a good experience.   So, if you in the Steeles west of Hilda area in a rainy evening, go and check them out. Just make sure to map it on Waze or you'll pass it by."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Ken Domik's YouTube channel where the owner of the Tickled Toad (Paul) is featured on some \"Cook & Review\" episodes.  After seeing Paul make some tasty looking dishes I decided to make the drive to Thornhill to experience it myself.   The place is truly a dive bar,  pure pub food.  The restaurant is quite big on the inside,  lots of tables and room to move around the large bar.  It's also quite dark in there,  and a little dingy.  Our server was very nice and our food arrived quickly.   My table ordered the Smothered Fries,  Paul's Rueben, and Butter Chicken Poutine.   All dishes were very good,  especially the Smothered fries.  Only criticism is that my sauce on the fries wasn't overly hot , no real cheese curds, and I expected the butter chicken to be much more spicier,  because I know Paul loves hot and spicy food.   Finally thoughts:  the Tickled Toad is a good place to come for beers and classic pub food.  I'd like it if the menu was a little more adventurous,  as I know Paul has the ability to be very creative in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Terribly rude staff. Ignored us. Had to go over to bar to wait for 10 mins to order a beer. Bartender was too busy with the locals. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Best in the area,  The only thing is they changed their french fries love the old fries hate the new,  people, atmosphere, value and food best in the area just hate the fries."}
{"text":"Walked in and tried to find a server. No luck for about 5 minutes. Finally someone came over from the bar, gave us menus, and left.  15 minutes go by and no one has come to check in on us, bring drinks, or take our orders. We left the pub shortly after that.  Great service!"}
{"text":"The Toad serves as the local watering joint as there really aren't many other options in the area. Service is incredibly slow, draft beer is poorly kept and food is average bar food.  The place is usually full of the young York U crowd and the odd older bar-goer. Patio is nice in the warmer weather, but no one abides by the no smoking by-law (nor is there any visible enforcement) and it is closed well before closing time."}
{"text":"The thing about the toad is that it is the best bar in Thornhill.  The issue about that is that the bars in Thornhill suck. Of all the choices, the toad is the best choice available. The waitstaff is decent, pending on the night and I've never had many problems with them in the past.  I usually end up getting the nachos or the potato skins. It's basic pub fare and its decent enough but not spectacular."}
{"text":"The service is always bad.  The food is always worse.  But if you live in the suburbs, or need a stiff drink after a visit with your parents who live in the suburbs, this seems to be one of the hot spots to do it.  If you like to party with first-year York University students mixed in with a few Thornhill highschool kids with fake IDs, you're going to feel at home at The Tickled Toad (or \"The Toad\" as locals call it).  The patio isn't bad, in the summer, for happy hour beers, but other than that, I cannot recommend this place in good faith, unless your initial plans were to dine at McDonalds."}
{"text":"It's a pub, sports on the tv, so ok, but still the décor could be a lot better.  Not that inviting.  We had fajitas- mine was good- Saturday night is 2 for 1 fajitas night.  My friend's glass of wine came in a...glass. The service was fast but....  There is music sometimes, not the night we were there."}
{"text":"Local old school sports pub. Has good beer selection, decent menu. Wait stuff is good, especially once you get to know them, but service can be slow sometimes, especially when they are busy. It is what it is for what it is."}
{"text":"Honestly the worst bar/pub i've ever been to.  It's around the corner from my house so about once a year i give it a second chance (it's sooo lovely to be able to walk home from a bar), but honestly they disappoint me EVERY time.  On more than one occasion the beer has been stale, and when we complained they said that's how the beer's supposed to taste (seriously?).  When we go on a fight-night or game-night to watch the game, they'll have it on all the TV's but will have the sound off (and no close-captions either).  If we ask for the sound (on even just 1 tv, not the bar speaker system) they just say no, despite our group of 10 being pretty much the only people there. Servers have all been pretty rude, but service is usually pretty quick.  Food has always been hit or miss (mostly miss), i've had a couple good appetizers but all the typical pub foods have been disappointing.  If i could i would give this place 0 stars."}
{"text":"Great place with very nice beer selection. Food was solid pub fare and we were not disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Nice enough with good wings, especially when it's cheap night. The beer selection is so-so, but it's clean and friendly.  Very nice service!"}
{"text":"Great Food for the price. Just wish we had one in So cal."}
{"text":"Wings and poutine were on point. Maybe I was just real hungry. But pretty satisfied"}
{"text":"PLEASE READ THIS TO THE END........This is my experience in this restaurant, my friends and I  have been coming to this bar since I was in my mid twenties roughly 20 years always never had any bad service till July 2014. For 6 months straight I been working 12-14 hour 6 days a week. That particular day I had missed my lunch and decided that since it was Monday it would be a good day to go get some wings. I came around 9:30 evening and had to go wash my hands on the way back I walking by the bar and asked the bar tender if I can place my order so it will be a little faster to get my order, he told me to have a seat at the patio and he will send the waiter to me, I had a seat and notice there was a group of 8 people sitting across the waiter came out went straight for the group ignoring me as he chatted for about 5 minutes asked them of they wanted the bill the waiter went back inside again ignoring me, 10 minutes later he came out and gave the bill to the group again chatted for 5 minutes went back again to get the change for them and again ignoring me he came out again to chat with the group never once even looked at me, I decided to go to the manager and asked him if he can get me another waiter he said he will to go back to my table, I did go back and waited for 10 minutes for the same waiter to come and asked me what I would like to order I told him I don't want to be served by him but I did still gave him my order because  I was very hungry and fustrated at the same time when he brought the order he put it on the table and stood in front of me watching me eat I told him to get out of my face so I can enjoy my late diner he said he wouldn't leave so I had no choice but to call him names so he can leave me, he went inside and called the manager the manager  came asked me to leave I told him I was still eating he grabbed the food under me and baned me from the bar for life. I don't think I deserve that kind of treatment I did not do anything to anyone. Since the incident my friends go to a different  bar for wings. This was my first time in my life I was treated like this for no reason."}
{"text":"Not nearly as bad as everyone else is saying; food is subpar, but service is relatively fast, and if you go for a weekday special, the food is a fair value. The day we went, they had a Santa Clause character walk around and distribute gifts; everyone at the table either got Toronto FC scarves or free headphones. Beer on tap wasn't stale - though, as we chose Canadian and Rickard's, they were probably two of the more popularly tapped choices. They also have strongbow on tap, which is a plus."}
