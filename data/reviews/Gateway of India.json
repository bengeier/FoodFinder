{"text":"I like this place - a lot. My boyfriend and I frequently get takeout from Gateways and the food is always delicious...the Egglplant Bharta particularly.
That being said, the reviewer who mentioned the cockroaches? Well, the dingy atmosphere is what inspired us to start getting takeout. A fresh coat of paint on the walls, a steam cleaner to the carpet and a makeover of the bathrooms would add a star and a half to this review.
Still, dinner is excellent...I wish I could comment on the lunch buffet but I've never been around to try it."}
{"text":"I have only ever ordered delivery, but I've always been really happy with the food that I've gotten.  My favorite dish is the vegetable korma, but the chana masala is also tasty and spicy."}
{"text":"Most of my Indian food experiences are based around the buffet places you find throughout Toronto, especially in Little India.  So, to come to this restaurant and realize that it wasn't a buffet certainly made it a bit of a challenge.  When I finally figured out what I wanted to eat (I know what things look like, not what they're called) and made my order, I remember enjoying the meal while it lasted.  

Unfortunately, I don't think the meal itself lasted long enough, meaning that the portions felt small.  Again, this could be influenced by my buffet experiences, but truth is that at the end I was left a bit hungry.

The waiter we had was ok.  He was friendly enough, but unfortunately he wasn't able to answer all of our questions."}
{"text":"I am so, so sad this place closed.  I used to order delivery every single week.  The delivery was slow, but the food was so, so good.  I haven't been able to find paneer pasanda anywhere else in Toronto, and I miss it greatly.  The butter chicken, korma, and tika are also good, but the paneer pasanda was amazing.  The prices were also really good for delivery.  Unlike most places, they would throw in a naan and rice for each item that you ordered.  This easily saves $7 or $8 off an order.  Gateway, please come back, and I will happily pay for the naan or rice!"}
