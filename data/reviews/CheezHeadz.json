{"text":"Great little place, kids favorite! The cheesesteak is awesome.  Seating is limited, can be tricky on the weekends but worth it"}
{"text":"Great pizza, ice cold beers, best pizza in Sun City area. Craig is the owner and aims to please his customers, go to groupon for great deals. Love the wing sauce and all the pizzas. Won't be sorry you ate here"}
{"text":"Cheese steak sandwich was the BEST I   .ever had.  Perfect bun, soft on the inside, crisp on the outside.  Meat done to perfection, mushrooms and peppers a perfect addition. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Best pizza place ever! We eat there every week. The guys are so friendly too. Like family. Again best pizza ever!!"}
{"text":"Decent, but not memorable.  The best aspect of the pizza would likely be that the sauce is great, which, while that IS nice - it isn't usually the first thing that one would look for in a CHEESE pizza from a place with a name like 'Cheezheads'. The sauce was a nice change of pace from the usual saltiness offered by most places, being sweet with bold hints of herb flavors.   I expected quite a bit more cheese, and moreover, as the shining ingredient in the plain cheese pizza I ordered... it should have been AWESOME cheese. It was alright. The crust was just okay as well... A bit dry, flaky, and overcooked on the bottom with so much flour clinging to the outside that it seemed to finish off with a chalky texture.  Wings were scrawny and fairly greasy, but the sauce's flavor was pretty good. Also can't really come up with a better word for them than 'Okay'.  Overall, the pricing is cheap but you get only what you pay for and nothing more. I set out to find great cheese pizza, and I was left feeling like I wanted to do it over again, and for the first time after the many occasions that I've purchased pizza with my family, there were... LEFTOVERS! Dun dun DUNNN!"}
{"text":"The pizza was good but the wings were quite dry (we ordered sauce on the side so you can really notice how dry the meat is).  I had a Local Flavor coupon but failed to read the small print which denied usage for \"take-out\" and \"specials\". I understand but don't like that these offers always have caveats that make them hard to use. I would think they would welcome new business with open arms. Lesson learned - no more CheezHeadz coupons for me!"}
{"text":"Great food and fast service. You order your food at the counter and it's brought to you piping hot. This was our first time and it won't be the last. Had to have the cheesesteak which was awesome. The bread is freshly made and its oozing with cheese had the Lombardi pizza which was awesome as well. Just enough sauce. They have kids meals. Ham and cheese sub my daughter had was loaded with meat and cheese. Prices are reasonable. Can not wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great service. What more could you want. Way better than the chains like NYPD Pizza, Rosati's, etc.  The cheese and toppings are fresh and the crust is amazing."}
{"text":"We were greatly disappointed in the pizza. We had \"the Lombardi\" pizza and it tasted like a frozen pizza, in fact I've better frozen pizza than CheezHeadz. The pizza lacked flavor, the toppings were scarce and the crust reminded me of Domino's or Barros Pizza. This is a pizza place for people who have never experienced great pizza. We also had the mac-n-cheese bites as an appetizer, and they were the best thing we had here. Also, I felt they were expensive for what you get. The service was great and the place has a good atmosphere to watch a game, but the pizza, avoid! avoid! avoid! This place did not make me want to leave my home for dinner, I could have made a frozen pizza for a fraction of the cost and enjoyed it more."}
{"text":"I love this place but it is hit and miss the sauce is not consistent. Sometimes it tastes amazing but then me and my friends noticed there was too much oregano. Not one to complain for the price place is pretty great"}
{"text":"I love their cheese steaks!!!!! The pizza is good ...... you're able to see the games from any seat in the place and the owner is always present which shows his proud in his business I think"}
{"text":"Split the gluten free G Force pizza w my husband as well as the Caesar salad minus the croutons. Really solid gf pizza!  Crust is crispy and not burnt. My father in law had the sweet Italian sausage & liked it a lot but he said he had the bratwurst on a previous visit & thinks the brat is even better. We are all originally from Milwaukee WI so the Packer paraphernalia is super fun for us. Love this place!  Will be back."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Great wings! Great cheese curds! our go to place for pizza. They are fast and friendly. They used to deliver, but don't anymore. I wish they still did."}
{"text":"Cheeseheadz has some of the best cooks in town.  The food has always been great and the service is excellent.  Best tuna and cheesesteak sandwiches I have ever had!  The owner Craig has really done a nice job of ensuring high quality food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Awesome hand tossed pizza!  Highly recommend the G-Force. That crust...perfection...with a nice crispy bottom. Good beers on tap, the SanTan Devils Ale paired perfectly.  Great, friendly, fast staff. Good people indeed. Owner is from Milwaukee, Wi. We enjoyed watching the Packer game there!  We look forward to returning, especially to try a cheesesteak with their homemade buns!!"}
{"text":"Decent with a shit location. The type of place i flip a coin on before going inside.This place must be struggling, with there special always changing they do attract the retired crowd but I do think that mostly has to do with the free beer sign outside. That's how you know there holding on if there giving away there cheap probly stail beer away. The times I did go to this place the food was so-so but prices didn't match. You can actually get a better pizza next door inside the grocery store made fresh. What this place does have with ultimately gives it all three stars is that it is owned by a normal American who lives locally and is defiantly giving it his all to make his dream come true for this reason I hope it all works out and I'll check back in a few years, maybe they'll be doing delivery again instead of the current change to to go or dine in only capability. If the owner wants to salvage it should be turned into a boston, Detroit, or New York place because no-ones from fudge packing Wisconsin ."}
{"text":"This place is great! Great food! Owner and staff....just can't say enough about them! Went there to check it out and had a great experience! We will definitely be back! Come to find out on Saturdays they have fun bands!  if you are a Packers fan.....you will be in heaven"}
{"text":"Yum!! Homemade bread makes for the best cheezsteak sandwich. Also tried the honeyBBQ wings (I think that's what they are called) which I was hesitant as I usually like traditional sauce but these were fantastic. Cheese pizza also excellent. Great place to bring the family."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, pizza special with garlic sauce,chicken,veggies was killer, ate the entire pie......one time he had Korean Pork Tacos, (special board)had to try and it was one of the best Tacos I've ever had. Kids ordered Turkey samy on fresh baked bread, that Craig makes daily in house. Parents had wings and pizza, all top quality all the while Craig and staff greeting us and having some of the best service of any restaurant in town. Thanks to you for our neighborhood joint to watch games, have a few and eat some of the best pies,wings, Sammy's and great specials."}
{"text":"Went there based on a recommendation from a stranger. Absolutely fantastic cheese steak and the owner was so friendly. The owner even knew his music he's obviously enjoying his business and it shows. Definitely going back to try his pizza."}
{"text":"just arrived in peoria for golf and mariner baseball! Needed a good pizza so where do you go? YELP! CheezHead was as good as aclaimed! fast freindly service and one of the best tasteing pizzas weve ever had! don,t miss this spot andd forgive them for no seahawk pictures on the wall!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat now! The sweet smokey wings are amazing, the pizza is amazing, this place is amazing. Happy to have a different and delicious pizza place to order from."}
{"text":"Good cheese steak, one of the best I've had in AZ. Good service.  Will be back.  This is a Packer Bar, so you know the food is good when a Bears fan is there."}
{"text":"Great place. Great people. No Viking posters tho. Really good food. We will be back with friends. A little clue to all. The Cheesesteak is the best. My wife wings. Really good."}
{"text":"We've been here twice before due to the location and their Monday \"large for a small price\" deal. It's a little pricey for the quality and quantity even with the deal, but not terrible... until today. My husband treated me to a Reggie White pizza for my birthday this week and it was so burned and bitter and hard around the crust that we just picked at the toppings. Since there are limited close options in this area, we may consider coming back someday. Definitely not impressed today though."}
{"text":"Definitely not satisfying. The bun in my burger was stale, almost seemed like it was toasted in an attempt to cover its lack of freshness. The fries were decent. The wings were average or maybe slightly less than average. Overall, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Cheezheadz has the most amazing Philly cheesesteaks! Love the mac & cheese bites too! We love going here for the food and fun atmosphere, especially on Friday family game night!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place about 2 months ago through Yelp. Took the kids there, we loved it. We have been back quite a few times since, I have turned several co-workers and friends onto this place. The Pizza is Great. Wife loves the Sandwiches. This place is worth the Visit. Love both there standard pizza sauce and the Garlic oil option on the pizza. My daughters prefer the Garlic Oil."}
{"text":"Finally found a place that serves AMAZING wings at a great price.  Had the smoky buffalo, only regret is that I only ordered 6. The pizza exceeded our expectations and the pizza bread has gotten the golden approval of my 6 year old. Great atmosphere, will definitely be back. GO PACK GO!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Small place and great for Packers fans. The owner was nice and the pizza was okay. The pizza we ordered had no sauce on it, only cheese and veggies. Flavor was nothing to write home about. Service was fast though and it looked as though they had quite a few beers on tap."}
{"text":"Have been here about 10 times and each and every time the food is very good and the owner and staff are super nice. I usually get the Lambeau Leap cold sub sandwich. This sandwich is one of the best subs I have ever had. The last time I went there I tried the western bacon cheeseburger and it was very good as well. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was just in there. Owner is a funny dude! Pizza was great, toasty and cheesy. If you're wondering, RC cola is just as good as Coke and Pepsi. We also had the Philly cheese subs to-go. Super yummy. Meat is cooked well. Cheese is good and not overpowering like most other cheeses. And the sandwich is not super juicy, so it doesn't make the bread all soggy, which is good."}
{"text":"I would have given it more stars but all they allowed is five. They have the best Philly cheesesteak I have ever eaten!"}
{"text":"First time in and what a wonderful surprise. The pizzas came out quick and were cooked to perfection. Not to mention they were quite large! The crust was slightly sweet but not to a point were it didn't compliment the sauce and cheese. Def will be returning! Welcoming staff!"}
{"text":"Stopped here with a Groupon.   Ordered a meatball sub & chicken parm sub combos for my family of 3. We had plenty leftovers.  Excellent taste, excellent service.  Can't wait to go back and try a Philly Cheesesteak and Buffalo Chicken Pizza."}
{"text":"Friendly little neighborhood sports bar. Really enjoyed the pizza and wings. I look forward to going back so I can try the sandwiches I have heard so much about."}
{"text":"Cheezheadz definitely has the best cheesesteak on the west side and maybe in the whole country.  The other subs are excellent as well.  I was there this week on taco Tuesday and the tacos were excellent as well.  The owner, Craig, is very friendly and accommodating as are the others that work there.  My only criticism is that they don't serve Pepsi or Coke products, only RC.  I highly recommend this place for excellent food and friendly service."}
{"text":"I like the small business feel of this place, wings are good, pizza was undercooked :( the service was good but if you are looking for good pizza, not the place"}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best place to get  a delicious philly cheesesteak. Does not dissapoint!! Just mouthwatering good. Bread is always fresh too. We all know good phillies dont exist here in Phoenix. This place is a gem."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I love this place. I personally love supporting small, local businesses. We go there often for lunch and we have always received amazing service and food! This is a great, casual place to go and get awesome food at fair prices. All the employees have great customer service and it's just a fun little environment. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Try the fried cheese curds!"}
{"text":"I had the Italian sausage and it was probably the worst I've ever had,  didn't even eat half of it. I forgot what my wife had but she also couldn't finish her meal. We are both from Chicago and this food was nothing like from that area. Can't speak about the rest of the menu but hope its much better but we won't be back to try it. The only reason I'm leaving a review is because there are lots of good reviews on here and not sure why that is,  but then again a lot of people out here don't know what good food is. I support small business so I hope they continue to succeed"}
{"text":"I can't believe anyone would give this place one star Craig is an excellent businessman who will do anything in his power to make things right if you are not satisfied with his menu for any reason I have been coming here for years and always been satisfied the food is excellent and have passed it on to all my friends who say the same nobody has ever gotten sick or not been treated like their family when they walk in the door with a big hello every time very very satisfied customers."}
{"text":"I went there for the first and have to say it literally made me ill. I ordered the cheese steak and it was disgusting.... Meat was burnt and nothing on it was distinguishable. The pizza I had is definitely over priced and lacked any taste at all."}
{"text":"Service is amazing!  Come here for more than just pizza. We had green chile, bacon, pepperjack burger, bratwurst sandwich and buffalo chicken, blue cheese pizza... What's up Wisconsin!?"}
{"text":"After eating here the other day I went home, watched some tv then went to bed..woke up in the middle of the night and puked...tried to lay back down but had to get up to throw up again. It did not stop there I felt like I was going to throw up my stomach! Sounds nasty but then I had bad diarrhea..I could not hold anything down..I felt like shit all day it was horrible! I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Hidden gem that is worth exploring..... The pizza is great and the wings are killer. The staff does an amazing job and their friendliness is very welcoming."}
{"text":"Best. Cheesesteak. Ever. Plus, Craig is awesome. I absolutely love this place, great 'cheers' type feel, great locals. More importantly, freakin' amazing food. I've had the pizza (under duress, all I want is the cheese steak), and it's surprisingly good, and, OMG, fried cheese curds. Wait, let me say that again. Fried cheese curds. What the hell more do you need?  Super friendly atmosphere, incredible guilty pleasure food, & a cool owner"}
{"text":"Best cheese steak in at least 20 miles. If you have one you'll come back again and again. Crispy fries, fried cheese curds, family owned, really good pizza, great buffalo wings, what more can you ask for."}
{"text":"Great little joint in the Phoenix area. Order at the bar and sit down to great fare. Good atmosphere and friendly folks! The food was fresh and tasted amazing... the cheese curds are a must have. Pizza is a little heavy on sauce so if you don't like a lot of sauce ask them to go light. Burgers were awesome and we also tried a rueben. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"AWESOME restaurant!! I have been here twice.  Both times were equal in quality in each and every way.   Staff all seem very friendly and more than willing to help. There was none of that \"my job vs your job\" atmosphere at all!  Even the chef takes orders if the waitresses are busy and he is not! Staff seems to be efficient and very knowledgable about the menu. They are willing to give their opinion on favorite items.    My favorite item is The CheezHead.\" It is pizza with five different types of cheese (mozzarella, provolone, cheddar, Romano, and parmesan.). You can choose to have marinara sauce or what my waitress suggested, which is roasted garlic and oil. Listen to the waitress!  I got a side of marinara but much preferred the garlic and oil.  Wait time for my food to be ready was very reasonable. Gluten-free small sized pizzas are available for an extra fee.   The restaurant also offers hot subs (Cheesesteak using ribeye, Ruben, Bratwurst, and more). They have several cold subs/wraps (Veggie,Corned Beef, the Club, as well as others.) There are also burgers, salads, and wings. Sometimes there are chef specials (items not on the menu which the chef creatively brings to the table.) There are kids meals, fries, and a couple of deserts. Given this is a Wisconsin themed restaurant, you will find fried cheese curds, mac and cheese bites, and of course, cheese bread on the menu.    There are daily food specials. Wednesday night's they offer an open mic for acoustical music and Friday night is game night!  When I was there for game night, they were playing Trivia, Family Feud Style.  Questions were easy (Ex. What do most people do when they are driving and see a policeman ahead?) Games are free to play. Yesterday they gave cash awards to the winners.   The restaurant is small but it did not seem overcrowded. Drinks include Coke products, Imported and Domestic Beer and wine.    Parking is great. The restaurant is located in a shopping plaza so there are empty of close parking spaces. Curves is nearby so ladies..... if you need to work off the wonderful meal you just consumed you are in luck!    My absolute ONLY complaint is that they currently do not deliver. I hope that's a consideration for the future.  Other than that, this is an excellent restaurant. I look forward to frequent visits for their awesome food and fun!!"}
{"text":"CheezHeadz is a great local place to get great food, service, and entertainment!  I'd never been there before, but walking up, I heard the sound of live music coming from within.  I opened the door to find a local band playing music, taking requests, and engaging the crowd.  Apparently local groups play every Thursday and Saturday night with Wednesday being an open-mic night. Not only was the entertainment on point, but the service was also excellent.  The staff members were very friendly and attentive even though my group was about the only non-regular patron group in the place.  To top it off, the pizza was quite good and excellent quality for the reasonable price.  Overall, an excellent choice for good food, company, and an overall enjoyable evening!"}
{"text":"What a great place! Local feel and good food, super friendly owner...wish I lived closer and could come more.  We tried the Reuben sub and the Tailgater pizza.  Both were amazing!"}
{"text":"Cool place to visit if you're a Green Bay Packers fan but very small, not very welcoming employees and very average pizza. I love pizza so would try it again but if I did, I'd try one of their specialty pizzas. Their cheese curds were AMAZING and basically the only reason for my 3 stars."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, we had cheese steak sandwich, chicken cheese steak sandwich, wings, fried cheese curds and buffalo fries. Everything was good. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Ok now I have to defend my review.....Well who ever was making pizza heard my wife ask for a steak an cheese pizza an he said he could make 1....Listen it was cheese heads green bay packers stuff everywhere. ..Once again maybe it's Green Bay Fans like cheese...."}
{"text":"CheezHeadz is awesome!  Their pizza is amazing! Their sandwiches are really good too! I have never had a problem with the meat being overcooked or having a burnt bun. ( I work near by and so our office orders from them often). They also have this Strawberry Spinach Salad (with candied pecans and a raspberry vinaigrette dressing) and I add avocado. It is INCREDIBLE!  The owner, Craig is very nice and he does remember your order and other helpful things.  He is very efficient and remembers to add in a plastic fork and knife to my to go order every time I order (I must say it is great knowing that every time I make an order that I know he will add my utensils all because I asked him to add it the first time I ordered).  This place is wonderful!"}
{"text":"OMG!! The Philadelphia cheesesteak was Amazing! The cheese curds were just Yumm! The Pizza did not disappoint. The service was awesome. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Spent lunch with my daughter today and the food was excellent!!! This was my first time eating here since I moved here from the Midwest."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great food.  Love the Friday night games.  Best Cheese steaks outside of Philly."}
{"text":"Love the cheesesteaks, sweet/smoky wings, and buffalo fries. They also have a couple great beers on tap and seems like they have live music every Thursday."}
{"text":"Picked up a couple of cheesesteaks to go after reading the reviews on yelp. Great sandwich. Quick service with a smile and a real interest in why I stopped in and where I had heard about them. I'll be making this my go to for cheessteaks.   The pizza looked very good too."}
{"text":"Pizza is good.  Very similar to Ray's, but not quite as good.   Wings were also good, but could use some more sauce.   Although i did not eat a salad, my coworker did and said it was one of the best salads hes ever had. Went back two more times to get it.   I have also tried the cheesestakes. They are almost identical to the philllys at Uncle Sams. I think theyre very good.   The owner and staff are very friendly and aware of their customers, which is nice.   Overall, 4 stars. Was good, but personally, id go to Rays over cheeseheads."}
{"text":"Popped in for a quick lunch last week, never been to a Packers Themed venue before! Their menu has various options that one will expect from the venue. We decided to go for sandwiches and their steak and burger combo sandwich was tasty! Overall nice quality service, clean restaurant, fast service and friendly faces!   Well worth the visit if you are after something fast, tasty and convenient!"}
{"text":"$60 for 4 double cheese burgers and fries? Are you guys high?? Not worth it/ plus you ran out of meat and send the low senior guy to the store to buy more beef. 1st and last time"}
{"text":"We love their cheez steak sandwich ! Very good. Service is awesome . Very friendly people. We had fries too . They are crinkle cut fries."}
{"text":"Not just giving this 5 cuz I'm a cheesehead great food and a staff that cares keep it going for small business Go Pack Go"}
{"text":"CheezHeadz is a pizza and wing place in Bashas parking lot off Lake Pleasant.  Independently owned and ran.  The inside is small but there's plenty of seats and sports on. We had a couple of their $25 specials which consist of a 16\" one topping pizza, 24 wings, and a 2 liter of soda which they subbed out for 4 drink cups.  We got one pepperoni and one cheese.  The wing flavors we chose were sweet and smokey and extra hot.  The food was cooked to order and came out fresh.  The sweet and smokey sauce for the wings was excellent. I wanted to dip everything in it.  The extra hot was good but definitely could have been hotter.  The wings were nice size and cooked well.  A good mixture of drums and wingettes.    The pizza was just okay.  The crust was decent with a chewy bite.  I think we should have done a thin crust.  The cheese and toppings lacked a bit in quantity and quality.  I think we are a bit spoiled with all the amazing pizza joints in the valley and have pretty high standards.  For the price and supporting local I would come back for wings and other items.  At this point I don't think I'd try the pizza again."}
{"text":"By far best philly I've ever had, absolutely delicious plus the staff is super cool  just a all around great place"}
{"text":"Always drove past this place and after more than year decided to stop and get a sandwich based on reviews. I had the Cheesesteak sub and it was excellent! Large portion for the price and they use 'real' steak! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good cheese steaks and the owner is cool. The cheese curds are also good. I will be back if I'm looking for a cheese steak that's close to home."}
{"text":"Normally I don't leave a review on my first visit but I am in LOVE with this place. All I can say is Cheezookie. It's a chocolate chip cookie right out of oven with vanilla ice cream. Yes, it sounds really simple but it is super good so make sure you leave a little room for Cheezookie. Freshly made pizza and a great selection of menu. Friendly service = 5 stars!  Can't wait to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"The pizza was fine. Service was also fine. Not much else to say. I would go back if someone invited me but it's not a place I would choose to go myself."}
{"text":"I cannot think of a better family-run neighborhood restaurant! Best pizza, subs and fried mac and cheese!! The owner is the nicest guy I know! I highly recommend stopping in for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Awesome place with a great atmosphere and excellent grub!! Highly rec trying the philly steak and cheese sub. So good. Practically inhaled it, but I burnt my tongue so had to slow down a little. They also have pizza and wings, salads, other sandwiches to choose from, etc. give em a try!"}
{"text":"It was my mom and I first time here. The philly cheese steak was great, the pizza was amazing, & the fried zucchini so good! The atmosphere was great! The two guys working were friendly and had great recommendations. I will return! The restaurant was clean, with lots of seating, and good for kids! Next time I will be trying the cheezookie."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for take out. We ordered pizza for the kids ,cheese steak sandwich for me and the Italian sandwich for my wife. We were very happy with our meals. I have never had a cheese steak in Philadelphia..yet but I imagine it would taste like the one I just ate. Best I have had so far. We will be going back"}
{"text":"This is a great place to take your family or friends  to eat amazing food!!! This is my family's favorite place to go when there's a birthday in the family:) they get to pick any restaurant they want to go to and they always choose here:)"}
{"text":"If you havent been here, you should be.  I ordered the Philly cheese steak with chicken and it was so delicious! The bread is made fresh daily,  the service was great and the food was fast fresh and delicious.  I can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Gotta be the best Cheese Steak in the Southwest! Gotta say, it rivals the Cheese Steak in Philly! Keep the nasty Cheese Wiz. This place does it right. I'm comin' back to try everything else. Just maybe not when Green Bay plays the Cardinals in December!  Go Cards!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Found this food gem in Peoria. Great pizza and wings! Wonderful service too! We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood pizza place with a real local vibe and excellent pizza.  Last time I was there, an elderly lady, with a very elderly husband came in asking for a tuna sandwich.  She probably came in because the Subway next door had suddenly closed down.  The man behind the counter explained he didn't have tuna sandwiches.  She then asked for a chicken salad sandwich.  He started to explain they didn't have that either, but then said if she would wait a few minutes, he would go back and make it for her, which he did.  Like I said, a real neighborhood pizza place."}
{"text":"I love this place, let me tell you why.  Food: Cheesesteaks, hot, cheesy, everything you look forward to when you order one of them. Salads, light, crisp, fresh, nice vinaigrette, house made! Pizza, great prices and man are they packed!!  Drinks: Local Beer AND Local Wine. Some places would say, ok, we got Budweiser and Barefoot, we are fine. Not The owner Craig. He talks local, and he walks local.   Service: The staff is always friendly, from the hostess down to the cooks. Have yet to have a bad visit. Smiles all around.  Events: They frequently have live music, so fun to have a slice and a glass and listen to local artists.   Overall: A+ Craig is an awesome owner and he isn't one of those hands off owners, you can typically find him there and that's how you know you are getting quality food and service. Thanks Cheezheadz, best Packers fans I know lol"}
{"text":"Walked in and was a bit surprised there was a live band playing. Reminded me of MN where I grew up for the atmosphere. The food was excellent. Got a couple pizzas and tried their Cheesesteak sandwich. Will be adding this place to the rotation."}
{"text":"So I went to CheezHeadz tonight and said I heard you guys have the best cheesesteak hoagie in phoenix...I'm from Pennsylvania and the hoagie was absolutely amazing! Definitely go check out CheezHeadz."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place because we are die hard Packer fans. Had a craving for Pizza and figured it would be a great chance to give this place a try.   We arrived on a Wednesday evening and walked right into a band playing. We found the host and she stated for us to sit anywhere. She brought us some menus and said when we were ready to order to just come up to her to place the order. Sweet young girl.   Ended up ordering 4 pizza's, cheese curds,french fries and four drinks. Do not recall the price off the top of my head but remember it not being a sticker shock for the expensive side.   Everything was DELICIOUS! We all of course tried each pizza and it was beyond full of taste. Happy to say I have a new pizza place and to top it off a PACKER bar!"}
{"text":"The philly sandwich was excellent. The hamburger not so good. The bun was rather hard. Outstanding service."}
{"text":"Friday night first visit.  Service here was great because they had so many helping hands. Atmosphere is a little different from what we expected. Kind of like a sports bar with music but it's more pizzaria. Beer and wine only.  Food quality is more like a 3-1/2 but the prices are more like a 5. Wings were very good. Pizza was adequate. Friday nights had trivia and bingo going on."}
{"text":"Nice people! Cheese steak is fantastic and other food is good too!! A great neighborhood hang!!!"}
{"text":"After only one visit so far.......  \"GEM ALERT\"  Possibly the very BEST CHEESE STEAK in the valley is served here.   Lets start with the roll.   IT'S MADE IN HOUSE! The roll is a little on the soft side and is chewy but does hold up to the generous amount of filling the sandwich contains. I would prefer it toasted but that is a preference. It's a respectable roll.  The sandwich is packed with the tastiest, tenderest melt in your mouth ribeye steak that I tasted in a sandwich in Arizona so far. It's a really delicious sandwich!  The fries were prepared hot and fresh but are the crinkle cut kind.   We shared the Mac-N-Cheese Bites because they sounded fun. Little triangles with a familiar cheesy tasting coating and inside seemed just like someone filled them with Kraft Blue Box Macaroni and Cheese.   This is a small restaurant that also serves beer and is family friendly. Children get to visit the treasure chest.  This is a casual small Wisconsin Themed Restaurant. You order at the counter, pick a table or booth and the food get ran to you.  Service was very helpful, friendly and efficient.  They made us feel welcomed dining there.  If you like cheese steaks and are in the area you're going to want to give this place a try!"}
{"text":"First time here. My wife and I had the Philly cheese steak. The buns where awesome! Service was good and felt like people where all friends. They know everyone! Next time we ate going to try the pizza."}
{"text":"My wife just came back from Philly area and asked the cousins to take her to the best CheeseSteak place they knew.  Took a friend to CheezHeadz today and Jo said it beat what she had in Philly!  I love the Lombardi Sub and the pizza is always good.  Love this place for the past 4-5 years. Go, and I know you'll tell Craig you'll be back!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is next to Bashas' on 99th and Beardsley in Sun City.    The workers here are super nice and helpful.  We had ordered our food and the woman working there told us we could order the combo and it was the same price as just our sandwich but we'd also get a soda and fries.  They also stopped by our table periodically to ask how everything was and whether or not we needed anything.  The food itself was good/okay.  My mom and I split a Philly cheesesteak combo ($9).  It was easily enough for the 2 of us.  The bread was super soft and fresh.  The meat was a lean cut, which I like, but it could have used more seasoning.  The sandwich also had a good amount of cheese, sauteed onions, bell peppers and mushrooms.  I thought the french fries were really good.  They were nice and crispy and had a yummy seasoning (not just salt).  So I was super glad the woman pointed out the combo so we were able to try them.  Lastly we had a order of 6 buffalo wings ($5).  These were tasty.  The chicken had the perfect amount of breading and the sauce was a good buffalo sauce.  It was tangy and just the right amount of spiciness."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the valley with fresh toppings that others don't carry like fresh basil, artichokes,  etc... Highly recommend you try it, it's my new favorite place."}
{"text":"This place was previously \"Luckys Pizza\" (not so lucky or yummy if you ask me). Was excited when I found out it had been bought out by the owners now, calling it \"CheezHeadz\". Went in today to try it out and was more then happy with it. The service was great and fast. They were all so nice and friendly. The pizza was delicious and made with all fresh ingredients, you can tell by how delicious it tastes. Not to mention they use 100% Wisconsin cheese. That made the pizza right there, there is definitely a difference you can taste. Also got a salad that was fresh and crisp. Will be a regular there for sure! Try it out!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! The owner was kind enough to slice me up a free sample of their homemade bread with the best dipping sauce I've ever had. My friend says he's hooked on their wings. So on my next trip back, I'm going to try one of their subs and wings. The chalkboard wall is a great idea for the kids. They can go and doodle while the adults wait for the food."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Great food, great service. Go on Friday, take the kids and play trivia, they will love it."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and wings! The best pizza in the neighborhood.  The only downside ... its a Green Bay Packer hangout.  LOL"}
{"text":"A must go!!! Food was great. The Cheese curds and steak sandwich were amazing.  Pizza was solid as well. Only bag thing is they are packer fans.  Go Hawks!!!"}
{"text":"I know my pizza and I can attest Cheezheads rocks! I cant stop ordering their lg 4 cheese with light tomato sauce, jalapenos and artichoke hearts....One of the best pizzas I have ever had. Too bad I wont be able to explore the rest of the menu....lol"}
{"text":"Cheezheadz is a wonderful family environment with amazing food!!! Every time I have ever been in the restaurant the staff is friendly and attentive. The owner, Craig, is always there  making sure everyone is happy, comfortable and that their food is perfection! Not mention if your a packers fan Cheezheadz is as good as being at the stadium on a Sunday afternoon! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone!!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Good food and good weekend entertainment! We love coming here with all the family for a fantastic night out!"}
{"text":"I will be totally upfront and say this review is wholly incomplete. My family and I came in here last night for dinner and the place was PACKED. Great for the business, not great for someone attempting to try it out. Seemed that there was some party going on with an Elvis impersonator singing. However, we decided to stay and give it a shot. Having never been here before, my family and I waited close to the door for over 5 minutes for someone to greet us and show us to a seat but nobody ever came up to us. After waiting for that long, we decided to go somewhere else.   I was really looking forward to eating here as there are many great reviews. My family and I will be back to try it out at some point at which time I will update my review. Unfortunately, you can only review that experience you had and it wasn't good. But still very open minded and WILL be back."}
{"text":"New to the area, we were looking for an Italian place close by. We checked Yelp and found this place. I ordered a meatball sandwich, veggie pizza (thin crust) and garlic bread. Everything was very good. The meatball sandwich was huge. The thin crust pizza is worth ordering again!  Good basic garlic bread - butter and garlic.  This a good \"go to\" place, and nearby. We'll be back!  It's been about a year now since we found this place. My only challenge is they don't always answer their phone when we are trying to place a to go order. Sometimes if we don't get an answer after the first couple of times we've just called another place. I hate to do that, but...."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. Cheese steak was awesome. Customer service was great. Perfect neighborhood pizza/sandwich/beer spot. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"We happened to see the reviews and decided to check it out. We were immediately greeted by staff and welcomed. Cheesesteaks were so awesome and enjoyed the laid back atmosphere. Thank you."}
{"text":"Best Cheese Steak in town and it's a Packers teamed decor!  You def need to get the Cheese Curds!  Anytime is a good time to come! Family friendly!"}
{"text":"Went here to use a Groupon and it was pretty good! Hubby had a 12\" pepperoni and I had the 12\" Reggie White pizza. Needless to say we ended up boxing most of it to take home as it was way too much to eat. But they sure made good leftovers over the weekend!  We got a free order of garlic bread for checking in when we first got there and it was awesome! Lots of butter and garlic! I really want to try a cheesesteak next time we go!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place.. Pizza is so good and the mouthwatering cheezheads cheezsteak..Very clean and friendly staff.."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant because it is very close to where we live. We placed a to go order for  a large Lombardi specialty pizza, the fried cheese curds and 12 buffalo wings. All together over $40. The pizza was not made according to the description on the website, it had very little meat on it and didn't taste near as good as the competition out there. The cheese curds were ok and the wings were good but there was no wing sauce on them or to dip in. The kids wouldn't touch the pizza and we normally order the same exact type from other pizza restaurants and the kids love it. My husband ate two pieces and I ate a half a piece. The pizza was really that bad. I don't see us ever ordering from there again. I even mentioned to the gentlemen who took our order that it was our first time ordering from them so if this is how they cook for first timers I don't see any reason we should try again. :-("}
{"text":"We had the special for lunch. It was a large slice of pizza a large dinner salad  and a large drink. This for $4.99. We felt the salad was good, and love the pizza. Next time I want to try the Philly cheesesteak. Online there was an offer for a free garlic bread if you show them the coupon. This also is great. No doubt about it, this is a great place to go for lunch"}
{"text":"The girl who works the counter/register is the person who saved this review. The man answering the phone and taking orders has some pretty awful customer service skills, but the friendly girl made up for it!  The pizza was pretty good, and the wings were above average. I was grateful that I was able to take advantage of the special even though I didn't want a soft drink.  I'd definitely come back for reasonably priced pizza and wings takeout."}
{"text":"Went inside and was told I must buy something if I want to get a water cup, which is technically illegal in state of Arizona. I've been there multiple times to hangout and snack on some appetizers and even asked to do an advertising project for my granddaughters media class featuring them and the owner acted angry we was there \"bothering his customers\" when there was two people there and it was in the morning on a slow Tuesday. The pizza is soggy which is why if I ever do go there, I'd stick with the simple fried food that is hard to mess up. Their cheese curds are the only thing worth ordering in my opinion."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic. I have brought my family here multiple times. My kids love the wings and always want the Cheezoki."}
{"text":"It's good pizza & wings, cold beer, little lite on ingredients, but it was decent pizza, I have several other places I prefer, wanted to try this place even though it's not real close to home, wish the wings would have come out with the pizza, we were done with those & Still waited, not a big deal, just never ran across it before."}
{"text":"So the food here is awesome.  They sell the same things that many places like this sell but here it just tastes better, you get is fresher.    The prices are average for many things, and a bit higher than average for pizza and some of the sandwiches, but this is because they use higher quality ingredients.  The only negative I can think of is that they are VERY cramped, they have a small place, and their success makes it full most of the time when we go.  It is nice to see them have success though.    I am also a late eater, and we have shown up a few times at closing and they still took care of us.  I think if they closed at 10pm they would have even more success.....but more work."}
{"text":"Food here is really good, but let's be honest a lot of places have good food.  I've tried a lot of their menu, several varieties of pizza, cheesesteak, wings, garlic bread, and more.  They don't go over the top to try to make the food fancy.  They just do the details perfectly.  Food is very consistent and prices are very reasonable.  I can feed my family of 5 and easily get out of there under $30.  It's obviously a Green Bay Packer's fan spot, noted by the decor, but what really makes this place stand out is the atmosphere and local feel.  It's kind of a hole in the wall place, sandwiched (pun intended) between a Basha's and a Subway.  The owner is always there working with the staff and saying \"hi\" to customers, making sure things run smoothly.  They do a lot to make sure you have a good time.  We've been there when they've had live music,  and tonight we did trivia and music bingo.  The whole place was singing Bon Jovi and \"Sweet Caroline\".  My youngest son (5) was downhearted after the game of bingo and I asked if it was because he  didn't win.  He said \"No, I just don't want to leave.\""}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time a couple of weeks ago.  My fiance and I shared an order of wings and a Cheez Steak.  We will be returning, it was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, good food, and a friendly staff!  Food: I had my taste buds set on the Cheesesteak, reportedly the best in the valley. But, as others have said, they often have a chef's special, so I wanted to check it out before I ordered. Well, Craig (the owner) told me the special was sold out, but proceeded to offer me several other things not on the menu that he could whip up. The Chicken Fire Wrap caught my attention, along with a side salad and drink. I was not disappointed! They make the hot sauce themselves, and goodness is it spicy! The salad was fresh, with a tasty balsamic vinegarette.   Cost: Reasonable: the wrap, a good sized side salad, and iced tea came to a little over $10 with tax.  Service:  Just great! As soon as I walked through the door, Craig figured out I was a first-timer, and came to my rescue. He was very helpful and friendly, as were the rest of the staff.  Atmosphere: Typical neighborhood type establishment - comfortable. The place is very clean, and as a bonus had classic rock playing at a reasonable level in the background.  Overall: What a great experience! I definitely want to return to try the Cheesesteak!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza This is neighborhood establishment and the owner is always there, which is a good thing. The beer is cold the prices are good and the pizza is terrific"}
{"text":"Service is always great and food has always been pretty good. We usually have pizza and wings. Have also had their burgers which were good. The only negative is that anytime we have tried to visit in the evening all tables have been reserved for the entire night, so we only try to go for lunch."}
{"text":"Went there today @ 4:30 to try their cheesesteaks, but the place was closed and appeared to be out of business. Revised review: I received a message from the owner, Craig, that I was mistaken and they were simply closed on Sundays, for the time being. I've been craving a Philly Cheesesteak, and with the reviews, had to try this one. It is as good as advertised. My wife had a club sandwich which was fresh and flavorful. The break makes all the difference. The menu is widely varied, so we will definitely be returning. I research restaurants in this area, looking for new ones to try, and I'm REALLY glad we found CheezHeadz. Try it; you'll like it."}
{"text":"Great local hang out. Food was fast and good! Even though we are not Packer fans, we will be back!"}
{"text":"For a large double cheese and mushroom pizza....best I have had in all of Phoenix so far!  Good amount of cheese and good crust.  BRAVO!!!!   And thanks for being so concerned with your customers as to if they like your food, Mr. Owner.  It's great, and you should last here a looooooooong time I would think.  I know we're coming back soon...very soon!!!  Ordered this a second time another week....my gosh, but his hand tossed pizza is a winner!  I am so glad he moved to this part of town...mmmmmm, goooooood-o!!!!!   Update:  Tried the Italian sausage sandwich....omg!  The rolls are delicious--great meal!  OK....I think I'm hooked on this place!!!  My next taste treat here is the meatball sandwich....must be heaven if it runs true to course on this place...yum!  Update:  I can't tell you exactly how many pizzas we've purchased from here now but about one a week.  Same excellent quality and taste every single time.  Thank you Universe for putting CheezHeadz in my neighborhood!!!  We just LOVE the pizzas here!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place as it was close to my home and was given good reviews. Ordered the 16\" with pepperoni and half sausage and pepperoni. Got a free order of garlic bread for Yelp check-in. Garlic bread was not good. The bread seemed stale with loads of butter and a hint of garlic. Good thing it was free. Pizza was better, but nothing special. I don't eat pizza normally so when I do I want it to be memorable. Unfortunately this was not the case. If I was at a party and this pizza was served, I would eat it. However, I probably won't buy this pizza for dinner any time soon. Really wanted it to be great because it's a family owned joint. Glad other Yelpers like it, though..."}
{"text":"The best cheezsteak ever!!! Wings are crisp and full of flavor!! . they bake their own bread. Love the football decor, GREEN BAY.. and all TVs are new!!! Great place to eat."}
{"text":"Owner Craig was great!!! Philly Cheese Steak was awesome; wings were great!!! Only thing wrong was I went back & brought a bunch of peeps go eat lunch on Sunday & they're closed?!!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, and even better cheesesteaks!! Friendly staff!! Great Packer vibe and they will show the game on tv's.  Fun live entertainment weekly!"}
{"text":"The only place I'll come for a cheese steak. Great place to come and listen to good music and relax with a beer. Great family establishment, the owner Craig is one of a kid and a great guy. Love coming here."}
{"text":"I was there last Friday night with some friends for dinner and Family Game Night.  It is a small place but looks like a great little neighborhood place that specializes in cheesesteaks and pizza.  I ordered the Reggie White Pizza and it was delicious.  Another friend had the Mac and cheese bites and she was raving about them, too.  First, we played Family Feud which was a lot of fun for the first hour and then rock and roll bingo.  Singing along with the videos made this even more fun.    They have live music on Thursdays and Saturdays.  Plus if you are a Green Bay Packers fan or Wisconsin Badgers fan, the games will be on the tv.  This has become my new favorite pizza place."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here for lunch while working. He's a fan of the anti pasta salad and I ventured out and tried the boneless buffalo salad!! I now have a new favorite! They are always so friendly! Anything to support a non-chain restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place was great when it was lucky's but now its even better.  I had a philly steak sandwich made with fresh bread grilled with butter on the grill (should I say more??)  The sandwich was so good I ate the whole thing and it was huge!  They also have good pizza from what I hear and even a gluten free option.  The place is about medium size and very casual and if you are not a Green Bay fan on Sunday you better put on your game face!"}
{"text":"Great little place! Fresh baked bread filled with cheese steak served piping hot. This was our first time there and we were impressed with the food, the owner and the staff. Super nice people."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our subs and fries; Lambeau Leap and Cheese Steak.  They were both delicious and had a ton of meat.  They have a pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw that we will try next time (it isn't on the menu that was on my door).  Love the sports themed atmosphere (ESPN) playing on the TV's.  They have a chalk wall for the kids to draw on.  They have bottled beer, wine and 5 beers on tap.  The owner/Chef is very attentive and friendly.  Give them a try.  They are locally owned."}
{"text":"I come here on break from great clips and everyone is always friendly, i love their sweet buffalo wings and turkey sub. I've had a few other things,on the menu and its all good- food is always fresh"}
{"text":"Best cheese steak I've ever had, period. Great guys. Friendly service. Food comes out hot, and tastes fantastic. We all go here for lunch now."}
{"text":"This has a Cheers vibe. The owner makes an effort to know people's names and give recommendations. The pizza was good, the kids meals are cheap and large, overall the food is tasty and reasonable. It's s place for regulars and to feel like one even if it's the first ime. Try it out if your in the area."}
{"text":"I have to give his place a 5 star this is the first place all 4 of us (my kids included) will eat the same thing! My youngest hates pizza has never eaten it! So normally we have to order him something completely different! But today when we ordered from cheezheadz we all ate the pizza!! It was amazing ! Nicely done!"}
{"text":"Awesome food ! Amazing cheese steak sub A++. Definitely found my New go to place for great food Friendly staff great place"}
{"text":"Haven't had a bad meal yet! You are doing yourself a deal disservice by not trying this place out!!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times always good. The Buffalo fries and Buffalo cheese steak are super good. Prices are decent it's a nice little place for lunch."}
{"text":"Always a great time and awesome food! My wife and I  stopped in for dinner tonight and found it was Friday game night. Very fun time!  Huge thanks to Craig and the team for top-notch food and customer service! If you are reading this and haven't been to Cheeseheadz,  you really should stop by for lunch or dinner and say hey to Craig... you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Excellent neighborhood hangout! Decent local pale ale on tap. Nice atmosphere--won't hold the Packer chzheads against 'em. Not a Chicago Bear fan myself.   Very tasty cheesesteak--def must have! Pizza is tasty too--reminds my wife of the pizza that she grew up eating at Original's in Newport Beach. And surprisingly, their side salad is super awesome with the tasty balsamic dressing--another must have.   Will def return to try other menu items but all of the comments about the owner are spot on! Super friendly, engaging and customer-oriented. He comp'd a patron's onion rings because they weren't thrilled--that's service!"}
{"text":"We traveled 6 miles north to get to this place for lunch. Tried the Cheezsteak-it was cheesy! Will definitely come back again to try the Hodag."}
{"text":"Love love love this quaint place. Good food and fun his , catering for a large crowd rocks"}
{"text":"The wife and I just had lunch here for the first time, it won't be the last. The food was hot and fresh. The staff was friendly, upbeat and made us feel welcome and comfortable.   The fried zucchini was light, crispy and tasty. The cheezsteak was outstanding, lots of meat and veggies and fresh bread. The fries were crisp on the outside, creamy on the inside like they should be.  My wife said \"don't forget the draft beer was ice cold and delicious\"!  Looking forward to going back to try some other sandwiches and maybe some pizza too."}
{"text":"Best cheesesteak in the area. Great staff and locatio n. Pizza looks great. Will have to try it on my next visit. Lunch special till 3 pm is a great deal."}
{"text":"Came here with the family for the first time after we couldn't decide where to go for dinner. After reading some great reviews we decided to give CheezHeadz a shot since we live nearby, and we're so glad we did! As all the previous reviews have mentioned, the staff here are super friendly and helpful. They were constantly making sure we had everything we needed at our table, and even made great suggestions when we ordered.  My dad, (who grew up in the Philly area and is very particular about his cheesesteak sandwiches) really enjoyed his CheezSteak and both of the sandwiches we tried had great quality bread & very fresh tasting ingredients.  The buffalo wings were a little strong smelling on the vinegar side, but they still tasted great. The ranch here has a very distinct cucumber taste but it tastes delicious with the wings and the pizza! We have definitely found a new favorite pizza spot on the west side of town. Can't wait to go back again and try their Cheezookie! We just couldn't make room for it this trip after everything else we ate!"}
{"text":"It's not clear you need to order at the counter however everyone was really friendly. The crust on the pizza is great. Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. One in our party had he Ruben and he said it was also really good. Solid pizza place!!!"}
{"text":"Killer sandwiches. Fat guy approved. Pizza and wings are ok. Now it's still getting 4 stars despite the ok pizza solely on the sandwiches. Iv'e had a lot of sandwiches and consider myself a bit of a \"junkie\". The cold sandwiches are great and the hot sandwiches are insanely good. They make a killer chicken cutlet. Their steak sandwiches are awesome as well."}
{"text":"Very light on the cheese  I can't see people giving this place 5 stars when it said best state philly in  I can't see people giving  5 stars"}
{"text":"Love it!!! Go Packers!!! Love the cheese curds, pizza, and pizza cookie Cheezookie! Great customer service!! Friday nights are awesome! Trivia games and music bingo! Prizes and fun for whole family!!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place by accident. I'm so glad I did! The pizza, wings, and salad we ordered were so good! It's hard to find \"gems\" like this in Peoria."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out on a Saturday night. It is a Packers themed restaurant (CheezHeadz, get it? HEHE). As we walked up to the doors we heard music playing. We walked in and they had a live band playing. We sat ourselves and were greeted quickly and given menus. My boyfriend went up to the counter and placed our order. We also used the Yelp check-in to get a free order of garlic bread. He also ordered 2 cheese steaks and the hot wings.   The food was amazing!!! The garlic bread was hot and yummy. The cheese steak was one of the best I have tried. The hot wings were EXTREMELY HOT!!! Like burn your face hot. We were warned and took the risk because we like to live dangerously. We also had enough leftovers for later.  As we were sitting, eating, and enjoying our food the band was still going strong. People in the dinning room were clapping along. The excitement was contagious and my boy friend and I began singing along. The decorations are also really cute. One of my best friends is from WI so I know all about the Cheeseheads. I can't wait to take her here next time she visits."}
{"text":"I really love this place! Pizza is SUPER cheesy with a great taste.  We always ask for extra crispy which they accommodate easily.  Very friendly and fun staff and customers.  Easy place to bring your kids.  Lots to look at , family friendly, and many fun events."}
{"text":"I really love this place and it's even better if you're a Packers fan! The pizza is delicious and the cheese curds are some of the best I've ever had. The owner is super friendly and not only remembers you but remembers your previous order. Go Pack Go! I'm very happy this place opened!"}
{"text":"My previous five star review from 10 months ago was primarily for the cheese steak. Well, since then, we have become regulars. We have since expanded our experiences from their menu!!  We, of course pursuant to my previous review, love the cheese steak, the one that gets so much attention in most of the reviews! But since then, we also have discovered that we also love the wings AND the pizza!! And we finally tried Cheezheads version of a Reuben. It is not traditional, and I was resistant, but I finally ordered one and very much enjoyed it!!! The (I assume because of quality) 'homemade' corned beef was yummy! There was a lot of of meat and quality sour kraut and lots of quality cheese. I will reorder it again, for sure, along with everything else we have tried so far!!!  The food is great, the staff is super friendly, the place is busy, which means it is a success...for a reason people!!!  Call to inquire about the special of the day (ALWAYS something exciting) and to find out what's going on as far as entertainment!! This place has live music, singers, bingo and more!! It is soooooo much more than a \"restaurant\" and even more than a neighborhood stop! It is a place similar to \"Cheers\" where you just BELONG!!!!   See you there!!!"}
{"text":"Great Philly!!!  Soft bread and great shaved ribeye.  I will be back to try some Pizza ;-)"}
{"text":"We specifically went to CheezHeadz for the first time yesterday to watch the Packers game and couldn't have been more pleased.  We weren't even hungry when we walked in but when our food arrived, it was so appetizing and tasty that we ate nearly everything!  The Buffalo Wings were delicious with plenty of sauce and fresh crispy celery sticks, I can't wait to try the Honey BBQ... I gazed with envy as they went by our table on their way to other diners and they looked great.  We ordered a Pizza with a Garlic Oil sauce, fresh Tomatoes, Italian Sausage and Fresh Basil. Loved it!  I don't usually care for Pizza Crusts and end up scraping all the good stuff off and just eating the topping but their crust is delicious. The wait staff is great, friendly, smiling and appreciative of your business. This is the kind of place that deserves a long life.  We will definitely be going back...but in case we're too lazy that day, and there is a good chance of that!....they deliver!"}
{"text":"Excellent food no frills kind of place. If you are looking for something from the norm. But in a good way than this is the place for you. Went on a Saturday night and listened to some live music. For sure a great idea that sprung from an idea out of Wisconsin. All that said it sure is a Green Bay Packers place. But they welcome everyone even Bears fans."}
{"text":"Come for the beautiful and delicious pizza but don't miss the really great burgers and hodags. Cheese curds are a must also."}
{"text":"Small little joint in North Peoria. Great pizza and the service was even better. Live band tonite (sat nite) as well. Being a Bears I could have done without all the Packers decor but sometimes you got swallow your pride to eat good pizza. Will be back. Several people asked us if our food was good (it was) and the owner or manager thanked us for trying them out. Will be back"}
{"text":"Based on the ratings we called to have our order delivered.  We were informed that they quit delivery about two weeks ago. I told them they should update their website.  So we ordered to go.  We ordered a hamburger, and the daily special of a brat.  For sides we ordered fries & cheese curds.  The hamb  was way over cooked.  The bun was toasted to the point of being burned.  The brat was good as was the bun.  The cheese curds are nothing like you get in Wisc. (I lived there).  Fries were frozen.  I so wanted them to be fresh, especially since they make their own bread.    Not sure if we will try them again."}
{"text":"Awe, the message I got made me realize my review sounded like I was complaining over the music. It was just a thing my friend and I noticed at every place in AZ. WE LOVED THIS PLACE!!!  No need to apologize on anything, explaining the cheesy bread would help. Did I mention how awesome the cheese curds were and that if I were there I'd order right now?"}
{"text":"Everyone talks about cheese steaks and they are outstanding.  But the gem here are the burgers.  Probably the best burger I've had in the area.  You would be gluttonous to eat a double. I haven't had the pizza but as a pizza snob it only looks ok. The red meat is where it's at."}
{"text":"This place is the best!! Support small businesses and eat here! They have amazing food!! And cheese curds!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is very good and the Philly & fries were great. People there are always nice to my wife and I even when we're wearing our Bears gear & they're Packer fans. We live nearby and hope they stay around!!"}
{"text":"I eat a low carb diet, and they made a Philly cheesesteak sandwich without the bread and their wings are bread free. A lot of places give you a hard time when ordering a low carb meal, not these guys! Not only were they super nice, but the food was wonderfully fantastic and came out super fast!! Definitely will be returning in the near future!! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great pizza and GBP spot to watch the games!  It can be a little noisy because some nights they have live music. But the pizza is worth it!"}
{"text":"I just ate one of their open face roast beef sandwiches and WOW! Amazing! The beef was very tender and the gravy just makes this sandwich the best I've had. If I can't remember the others, then their u go. The restaurant was very comfortable and cozy. Happy to have found it."}
{"text":"First time at this place.  Went in for a cheez steak and Tried the daily special which was Chili Mac and it was delicious!  Great laid back atmosphere.  Friendly service. Definitely going back!!! Oh and they have Hamms!"}
