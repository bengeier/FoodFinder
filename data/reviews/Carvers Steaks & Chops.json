{"text":"My husband and I went here for our date night and it's a good thing that we enjoy each other's company because no one seemed to want to come over to our table. 
We had a reservation and had to wait a few minutes upon arrival. When we were finally sat at our table, we waited 10 minutes before we even had water. One of the female servers (who ended up being our server) glanced over at us but did not say a word. She finally came over to our table and offered us \"something other than water.\" I asked to view a drink menu which she dropped off and walked away. My husband and I remarked how odd it was that we had been sitting for 20 minutes at this point and didn't even have a drink.
When the server finally returned we decided to order everything because we really didn't know when she would return. My husband ordered a long island iced tea and I ordered a dirty martini. I also ordered us two glasses of wine to come with dinner. I ordered the stuffed filet with a caesar salad and baked potato. The server closed the menus and went to leave the table before my husband had even ordered. My husband then spoke up and ordered his filet with a spinach salad and baked potato. The minutes ticked by and the waitress finally brought my martini. She stated that my husband's long island \"wasn't made right the first time\" so she was waiting for another. When his drink finally arrived we looked at it and knew this one wasn't right either. It tasted like there was Mountain Dew in it. I tasted my dirty martini and it tasted like the olive juice was rancid. We sent the drinks back and I asked for a bottle of wine instead. 
Our salads arrived and we still did not have the wine. I glanced down at my silverware and my fork was dirty. I placed it at the end of the table in hopes someone would pick it up; they didn't. When the server arrived with the wine she asked if I wanted to taste it after she had already poured me some and then dribbled it all over the table without so much as an apology. 
Our entrees arrived with the salad plates still on the table. I decided I was tired of looking at the dirty fork so I turned it in with my salad plate. The person who delivered our food asked if I needed anything else and I mentioned I needed a fork. She said, \"oh you turned them both in?\"  I will say that our steaks were delicious, however the temperatures were off. I ordered rare and it was barely cooked. The bacon that wrapped the filet almost looked raw as well. My husband ordered medium well and his was medium at best. We decided against dessert and just enjoyed our wine instead.
We will not be returning. Our experience was bad enough that I signed up on this site just to write a review. My suggestion to them would be to remember that if people are coming out to spend their money on a dinner out, please don't treat them like you could care less that they are there. I work in the food industry so I know what being busy can do to a server, but this place was no where near busy enough to warrant such terrible service. 
(Also, it would not hurt to have a manager walk through to see how things are going.)"}
{"text":"Went here after reading the review above mine.  Glad to see they just relocated.  Atmosphere and decor was better than the old location, so that is good.  Food was phenomenol!  We ordered steaks, asparagus, shrimp cocktail.  All was wonderful, and steaks were cooked perfectly.  Cannot beat getting a 14 oz Strip, Salad, and potato for $24.00.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a steak/romaine salad last evening. Good service. Surprised by relatively small size for a dinner salad. Lacked the flavor/excellence of one's I enjoyed when Carver's were located on Bell Road.  $15.00 charged represented poor value, regardless of venue.Felt fair price would be about $7.00."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  I waited 2 weeks to post this story, hopefully letting some of my true frustration go away.

Atmosphere is terrible.  It is located in an empty strip mall.  Dining room was almost empty.

Service was VERY slow despite being one of the only tables in the place.  Had to endure almost 2 hours of slow service and empty drinks.

My prime rib was mediocre.  My guest's fillet was terrible, obviously a cheap cut of meat.  Food was a big let down for a $$$ place.  Very poor quality for the price, many far better options in town.

The worst part of my experience was as I walked towards the single stall bathroom, an employee rushed past me, made eye contact and went in before me.  Normally I would not think much of it, but literally counted 10 minutes on my watch while waiting outside to use the restroom.  As he exited, he once again looked me in the eye and got back to work... how disrespectful!!

This seemed to sum up the entire dining experience: no sense of urgency or true regard for the patron.  This was true the entire time at Carvers, from having to look for a hostess to seat us, to using the boys room on the way out.  When I worked in the business, the customer always came first.  Here, I felt like I was inconveniencing the staff merely by patronizing the restaurant.

Don't waste your time or money here.  If you are going to spend $$$ on a meal, spend a little bit more time doing research here and truly treat yourself.  This place is a joke."}
{"text":"I first visited Carver's in October for a family member's birthday and couldn't have had a more perfect evening, from first greeting, to a great waiter and excellent food.  Because of that, and having a small family, we decided to try it for Thanksgiving dinner, which is always risky.  I made the reservation a month in advance and asked several questions about their plan, which sounded perfect.  On arrival we were led through the entire restaurant, through a back door into their storage room - literally.  It was behind a set of double doors usually kept closed, the walls were like particle board painted orange with some tacky wall fixtures, no windows and the neon Exit light over the industrial back door.  There were three tables crammed in this room which could have been card tables.  I immediately complained and was told that was all that was available.  When I asked about the empty table for six in the restaurant we just passed, I was told that had already been requested.  After complaining again to our waiter about being seated in the storage room, he laughed and agreed with me.  He also then relayed a story to us about a woman in the restaurant who was literally crying because they told her the pie was not included in the price of the Thanksgiving dinner, so after debating what to do with her they decided to comp her meal.  All while I'm still steaming because we couldn't receive better treatment.  At that late date there weren't a lot of options so we stayed.  

If anyone has any intentions of planning a dinner party at this restaurant, I would recommend you have a signed agreement on the seating plan before spending an evening in a storage room."}
{"text":"We had been a prior customer at the Bell Road location and we loved it there. This new cutesier place has a long way to go to meet the Bell Rd location. In a nutshell, we shall not return. 

We thought the waitresses were dressed sloppy- I guess they thought it looked neat to have your shirt pulled off the shoulder and showing the bra strap and one of them wore motorcycle boots with a big hole in her stockings. 

Our waiter greeted us promptly, but had to sit in the small bar area to eat or our wait time for the dining room was 30+ minutes.. 

We both had small prime ribs and salad. The salads were very good but the prime was so-so and lots of fat and grizzle. My shrimp cocktail was great but For $66 plus tips, I think I will spend my money elsewhere.."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight with my bf and two of his good buddies....originally since it was like three guys and I...Yardhouse would seem like a better choice...but his buddy insisted on trying Carvers so that is exactly where we ended up and it was a great choice!

I ordered the 8oz fillet mignon....perfect medium rare, succulent and tasty! paired with some peppercorn sweet potato fries and it's perfecto! Also came with Caesar salad and really good dinner rolls with whipped butter. =D It was well worth the $26 dollars to me.

My bf ordered the stuffed fillet - 8oz fillet mignon stuffed with Portabello mushrooms and blue cheese then wrapped with a strip of bacon. My fork couldn't resist from taking a small chunk....omg it was so gooooood! my mouth exploded with the flavors of mushrooms, blue cheese, crispy bacon and the succulent mignon all at the same time! it was a party in my mouth! =D i have to order this the next time...or well maybe try the prime rib too. super well worth the $28!

I definitely enjoyed this expensive dinner tonight =D   Although I must say the service wasn't as great. The waitress didn't really want to serve us...she wasn't mean but her services seems rather forced...in a way I kinda felt she was like that because we were young, Asian and wasn't super well dressed....I mean other people there were dressed very casually too..but there were a lot more older people...say around 40's and there was a family or two. But nonetheless, her service wasn't super great for a expensive steakhouse. 

The atmosphere is of course romantic -- your usual dimly lit, crisp white table cloths with white and silver dinnerware...candle on the side of the table and of course your wine glasses prepared to be fill with one of their expensive bottles of wine...hehe

I would definitely come back here when I'm in Arizona again! =D"}
{"text":"20 minutes at our reserved table without so much as a glance from anyone, much less a glass of water. Left and went to Flemings."}
{"text":"YUM! Prime rib is always excellent. Took mom and dad here for dad's bday dinner. Dad always complains about something while dining, but this was the first time he didn't! In fact, he couldn't stop complimenting everything!  We all had a very pleasant dining experience. Service was top notch, as well. We'll be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I went there For the first time a couple months ago. We were both not really impressed at all with the food or even the service. It wasn't horrible bit we both agree we will likely not be back. The atmosphere was a little too dark for dinner. The patio seemed nicer but we ate inside the dining room."}
{"text":"My Fiance and I went out to Carver's last night for the first time and we really enjoyed it. A client had referred me there and we were very happy. They had a date night special, so we both got an entree (ny strip w/ shrimp and parmesan crusted sea bass)- both Amazing. This gave us $10.00 off our check and a free brownie dessert. Lovely dining experience and great food & drinks. Our server, Beatrice was Amazing!

Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice now. The steak is incredible, I have eaten at steak houses across the country and this can hold it's own.  We ordered the filet and stuffed filet, it just melts in your mouth. The house wine is really good as well. Our waitress Debbie was so nice, we will be back!"}
{"text":"I was at Carvers for a private party. The staff was wonderful the owner was friendly and we had a great time. We had a set menu and it could not have been better, from the salad to the brownie sundae the meal was a delight.  I had the New Your Strip and sautéed spinach and a romaine salad. Each course was pared with a great wine.. I cannot remember the name now... Copper Creek maybe... I had been to the location on Bell, but this new location is so much better. For one not having to fight the traffic on Bell and two, they have a beautiful outdoor area. You may think the traffic noise would interfere with conversation but it was great.. The only interruption was the fire truck passing.  I would recommend this place for out of town guests, a second date or for happy hour with friends."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night at 6:30.  I was asked if we had a reservation, I said \"no, do I need one?\"  They said \"yes\" and that was it.  I walked out.  Wow.  I understand it's peak season, but let's see if they are singing the same tune in July.   Good luck."}
