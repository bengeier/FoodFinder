{"text":"Best Greek food I've ever had--and no wonder, as the husband/owner/cook is from Cyprus. This is family-owned and operated, and in the winter when the husband heads to Cyprus, his wife and daughter hold things down.

Best gyro I've ever had--massive in size, especially considering what you pay for it--and the spices in it are much better than your typical Americanized gyro.
The fries are from fresh-cut potatoes, and you can definitely tell. My stomach felt close to bursting when we left, but I still had to grab a few more fries on my way out.

The group of us--there were 6--ate for probably ~$30-$40.

We chatted for a while with the daughter, and then for a while more with the wife, so overall it was a great evening with great food, and meeting new people.

And they do takeout ;)"}
{"text":"Not sure how this place received so many good reviews..the gyros are good and the ppl are very nice..the rice was tasteless along with the Greek salad dressing..it was my 1st time trying this place and would not go back"}
{"text":"Awesome gyros!  Great kabobs!  Greek tea is awesome.  

Mother and daughter team are great.  Friendly and great service.  

Mike the owner is the Original mike from mike and Tony's in the south side."}
{"text":"It's not Greek to me, because this place makes perfect sense!

The people that own it are so sweet and make the best food.

Every time I go there, I stuff myself until I want to die. And then I spend several sleepless nights sweaty and anxious until I can eat their food again. I went from not liking humus to a humus-based diet after eating here. 

But do not ask for their recipes! Trust me, they know their food is made with magic and they are not sharing -- a bottle of wine and I tried to get it out of them once unsuccessfully."}
{"text":"Great food and cheap to feed kids. For the quality of the food here they could easily mark it up another 20% but they don't. I will continue to return because of this."}
{"text":"I wanted to explore Brookline and decided to stop here based on the reviews.I have to admit that I was expecting a lot more. But sometimes they say, \"less is more,\" right? The place is definitely really old school and fairly run down, a grease pit. The menu that I was ordering from confused me a bit because I was wondering, where were all the Greek items such as pastitsio, moussaka, saganaki, bakalava, and spanakopita?!?!? 

People have said that the menu was downsized but the only thing I could find that was greek was Gyros, Falafel and dolmades and souvlaki and I went with the Gyro. The Gyro was indeed huge and the meat was flavorful but the veggies were close to the end of their shelf life. The fries that came with the meal were crap actually, I know that they are fresh cuts fries so lets make sure that they are cooked all the way through and have some sort of uniformity in size and the oil that they were fried in was obviously fairly old. The fries were on a greasiness level of their own. I have never had such soggy fries. 

The service was certainly some of the most friendly I have had in sometime and the proce for the Gyro combo really is hard to beat it came in right around $6. So if anyone can tell me what I'm missing since this place is such a renowned Brookline establishment please do so."}
{"text":"Loved the texture of the spanakopita (somebody in the kitchen must have a healthy appreciation for butter) and the incredibly fresh warm pita. 

The staff is attentive and good-humored, and you definitely feel like you're in a cozy local restaurant. 

The Greek iced tea was also perfectly spiced and delicious - inspiration to experiment with cinnamon and cloves at home!

The hours seem to be somewhat erratic, so just call beforehand to make sure they're open. My boyfriend and I tried coming once around 8:45pm on a Thursday but they were closed."}
{"text":"so i'm greek and every time i go here, i get yelled at for not coming in all the time.  honestly, when i want greek food, either i make it myself or i go to mom's house and just have to say, \"ma, i'm hungry.\" and boom, there's a plate in front of me.

that aside, this place is about as family style greek cooking as it gets.  it does taste like what i grew up eating.  the spanakopita is flaky, buttery and moist as it should be.  melts in your mouth.  the dolmathes are very rich and with a good splash of lemon juice taste great.  

i havent been there in some time so i'm not sure if he's still serving falafel but when he did, damn it was good.  some of the best i've had, period.  but the gyros are where it's at.  i can only have one of these every so often or i think my heart may come to an arresting halt.  there's just a ton of lamb falling out of the pita and there is no sexy way to eat it so you end up looking like a bulldog eating a jar of mayonnaise.

hit this place if your an ethnic foodie.  you wont be disappointed.  even when the owner yells at you for not coming in all the time."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of It's Greek to Me in Brookline.  This tiny little place at the edge of Brookline doesn't look like much, but it has a real family character, cheap eats and tasty food.

I have dined in twice and got carry out twice as well.  The first time I got a platter/dinner, but I found the deal is really to be had with the gyros.  Getting two gyros and a huge amount of fries for only $10 is a steal.  The gyro bread is toasted, but still soft and it is loaded with meat like your grandma would try to feed you.  The veggies have always tasted fresh and it is served hot.  If I could change on thing, I would prefer fresh herbs on the gyro instead of dried.  This gyro is definitely more spiced up than your chain restaurant gyro.  The fries are fresh cut and nothing is cooked until you order it.

If you choose to dine in, you will be greeted by the proprietor and casually asked to take a seat any where you like.  This isn't the type of place for formalities.  She will offer you some delicious Greek Tea (you have to try it) and take your order, cook it and then serve it to you.  Sometimes you can hear bickering in the kitchen between her and her old man- but that only adds to the family atmosphere.  The store does take credit card, so that's a great modern convenience.  At the end of the meal, we've always gotten a stick of gum :)

If you choose to carry out, it's a simple call and your food is ready by the time you drive down there.  There is usually a place to park near by and you can be on your way quickly."}
{"text":"Hey! What happened to It's Greek to Me? The door is locked. The restaurant is empty. The pics are piled up out front. It's our favorite and we love the mom-daughter duo. Are we never to see them again?"}
{"text":"Not to sound like a broken record, but I am yet another reviewer who has to give this place the coveted 5-star rating. I returned to this place for the first time in many, many years (I used to have violin lessons near this shop and ate here often), and boy am I glad I did. 

I got a gyro to-go and have to say, wow. Firstly, it's a well-proportioned gyro - not small but not gigantic in size, either. Yes, this is a big deal to me; I like a gyro that I can eat in one sitting since gyros are so messy that the leftovers don't do well during a trip home. Secondly, it's an affordable gyro; it cost me all of $5. Thirdly, as others have mentioned, the seasoning used here is perfect and different, probably because the owner really is from Cyprus and knows how to make authentic Greek food.

Yep, that's a lot to be wowed about. The whole thing is so awesome that I wish I had a better vocabulary to describe it, and I'm too satisfied after my meal to get a thesaurus to try to come up with anything.

I didn't get any sides and whatnot this time around, but I'll be back - hopefully for a sit-down meal so I can explore the rest of the menu. Gyros are good and all, especially ones that obviously haven't fallen prey to American cooking styles (i.e. size, oils and seasonings or lack thereof used, ect.), but I really want to see what else the owner can do!"}
{"text":"If this is the same family that owns It's Greek to Me in  Dublin  Ohio I'm going to be super happy and know without a doubt this food is gonna rock. I was there in oh I training for a job for 2 weeks and this place was right across the st. I ate there 6 times while I was there. Breakfast and lunch! Bangin good food."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Fresh, made to order and yummy. It's a family place with seating for 20 or so and they do take out.  The gyros and souvlaki were very authentic.  Loved it"}
{"text":"I ran in here with a few friends for lunch.  I got the gyro lunch special.  The food was made to order, fresh, hot, and the portions are great.  They have hand cut fries and the sauce was awesome on the gyro.  Add to the fact the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I thought the gyros were just okay.. too much seasoning. Fresh cut fries is a plus.  I come here for the lunch special ($10.50 for two gyros and some fries). Great value"}
{"text":"So happy we found this little gem! My friends and I had delicious food and great service. When we arrived, they had the lights in the dining room turned off but were more than happy to accommodate us to eat-in. The best part of our experience was the service. Our server was the owner, who told us she runs it with her husband, who is Greek. She was wonderful and took the time to chat with us and explain any questions we had about the menu. 

We started with hummus, grape leaves and spanakopita to start. A few of us tried the Greek iced tea which is sweetened with cloves and cinnamon. It was VERY strong and I enjoyed it much more when I watered it down a bit. A very unique flavor and I would definitely give it a try if you are a tea drinker. We decided to split 2 dinners between the 4 of us and after the appetizers, it was more than enough food. The falafel platter with fries was ok, but the souvlaki plate with rice was definitely my favorite! We finished the evening with tiramisu and baklava, both were delicious. I was so full after our entrees, but seriously could have devoured 5 plates of that baklava. 

We had a large, great dinner for 4 which only cost around $60. If you like Greek food, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Hmm! Hmm! Well, I do agree this place is nice. I think 5 stars is a bit over the top.

That being said, the staff (the woman who owns it..) is extremely extremely nice. The prices are fair. The food was good.

I don't generally eat meat often, but the falafel here was quite excellent. Some of the other reviews claim meat, so I can't chime in there.

Try the tea!"}
{"text":"A revisit for dinner, and three of the four of us ordered meals with salad and rice rather than sandwiches. The salads were really good, with chunks of feta and interesting spices - but the plates just reminded me that the sandwiches, with all of the ingredients married together in saucy, pita-wrapped  goodness is where It's Greek to Me really shines. The sandwiches?  Five stars, no question. Play to the strengths of their menu, and you'll leave happy."}
{"text":"My husband and I  were just stationed here from Seattle because he is military.  During our time at Station Seattle, WA  we had the privilege of acquiring a taste for a variety of ethnic foods.  All those new  and fantastic introductions to our palates had us both wondering if we had any hope of finding such great thai, greek, and vietnamese here in the Burgh.  We just moved into a house in Brookline.  We bought a handful of restraunt.com coupons for Its Greek To Me since the place is just one block from our house . We developed a serious love for greek food in Seattle, and to be honest, this little greek eatery did not look like much- a bit run down. Has some cosmetic needs, but hey, its a tough economy and I'm sure they are focusing their finances on maintaining a clean kitchen and quality food.  We found that the inside of this little place packs a WHOLE LOT of heart!

.......We were NOT disapointed.  We took a walk this evening (friday) and popped in for a try. The place was buzzing with 8 people for its small size, who all looked like they were enjoying eachothers conversation and the food.   We chose to do a take out order since we were heading to the Dormont pool in a hurry.  We were greeted by the most genuinely kind and sweet waitress who also doubled as the cashier.  I heard her call the cook \"Mom\"  several times as she called out customers orders.  It  revealed that she was the cooks daughter.  &  that immediately gave us this settling and sweet down- home feeling. 

We ordered the large greek salad and     the     we were told- would be about a 15 minute wait, but that simply because the cook wants to make that as fresh as possible.   We did'nt mind the wait.  Its her specialty she said.......   IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT!  Delicious melty goodness in our mouths every bite!    My greek salad was crisp and fresh with I think the BEST feta I have ever had, full of the dark leafy greens--- not the ice berg lettuce -- wich I was usually served in Seattle.  Nope!  They had the good stuff.  The dressing for my salad was fantasic- not too oily, and to my suprise it came with a fresh baked pita, soft and warm on the inside, crispy around the edges, I could have eaten 5 of those things! WOW!   We loved it!  The cook was the kindest woman who was so warm and made  the most delightful conversation with us wile she slaved over that hot stove.  You truly feel valued at this little place.  I almost felt like we were exiting my nanna's house when we left.   GREAT JOB,  IGTM!!!!!   You have 2 new fans, and we WILL BE BACK many times!"}
{"text":"My parents and I recently ordered takeout from here last week, and I can candidly attest that IGTM still prepares THE absolute gyro in the entire metropolitan area. Unmatched in quality, its meat is still succulent, its tzatziki sauce still as tangy as it is manna-bound, its batura-like pita bread toasted to achieve the ideal balance of crispness and spongy richness, its vegetables are still farm-fresh, and the entire proto-sandwich is still dusted with that magical, colorful blend of herbs and spices that tempt the eyes as well as the tongue. The obligatory fries are shaped almost like paddles, and the husband/wife tandem of owner/operators will still insist on leaving the brown paper bag open to prevent sogginess. 

IGTM's menu has been scaled down a bit so as to concentrate more on what sells best for them. Stop avoiding Brookline and stop into It's Greek To Me for Pittsburgh's very best Mediterranean fare."}
{"text":"This small, family owned place is a great place to go for lunch. The gyros are very good, the hand - cut fries go into the fryer when you order them.  The family that works there are very nice, pleasant people, and the Greek iced tea is tremendous!  You can easily eat a full meal for less than $10, but there are plates for bigger appetites, as well. Dine in isn't glamorous, don't bring a first date, but come for lunch or quick serve dinner!"}
