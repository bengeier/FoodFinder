{"text":"Such an amazing and cozy restaurant owned and operated by an equivalent amazing and sweet couple. This boutique restaurant is named after their bubbly daughter, Isabella, and we can definitely tell where she gets her charm from! It is only the owners here and they are so attentive to every guest! So friendly and will have a small conversation with you as well. They are the best!  Now onto the food! We've been here for breakfast numerous times and each time the food gets better and better. Hopefully we will be able to come back for lunch/dinner.  Breakfast sandwich The breakfast sandwich may sound like your average thing but you can really taste the freshness of every ingredient. The egg is perfectly cooked and round (c'mon! Round egg!) and that bacon .. Gotta ask where they got it!  Tamagoyaki This is a stuffed Japanese omelette (contains onions, mushrooms, cheese and bacon). If you have never tried one, you gotta try this one! The way they prepare the omelette creates such a fluffy and lush texture that you're eating a fluffy egg cloud.  Mochi-Mochi Pancakes These pancakes are so thick but still fluffy! These Japanese style pancakes are definitely a unique take on your traditional pancakes. They have this with either with fresh strawberries/whipped butter/syrup OR bananas/Nutella sauce/chocolate chips OR bacon and eggs.  Definitely looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Savory food was decent taste wise but not surprisingly good, we got the loco moco and omu rice. Mochi pancakes were not chewy, so we were a little bit disappointed. They taste like normal pancakes but slightly more dense."}
{"text":"I went here after hearing about if from Blog to. The food looked great so I decided to try it with my girlftiend. I had the pancakes with berry sauce. The pancakes were not dry and stiff. I was expecting g it to be fluffy and moist considering that it's a Japanese pancake. The omelettes were great. Koroke were a bit to wet for me on the inside. They should be firm and soft like mashed potatoes but they were almost runny. That said the meals were  enjoyable. I was disappointed with the pancakes mostly and the koroke. I'm not too sure if the chef is Japanese"}
{"text":"I came in here on a rainy January day and had a cozy meal of one of my favourite things:  Japanese curry.  Absolute comfort food on a dreary day.  I am excited to come back and eat more off of their menu - including Cecilia's DELICIOUS cotton candy cake!  It's sooooooo good!  David and Cecilia are so lovely and make wonderful additions to our neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect and the staff are so friendly! The food is phenomenal as there is a combination of traditional western breakfast foods and Japanese cuisine. I love when unique places open in the beaches and this is definitely one of them. On my first visit I had the chicken teriyaki and the rice and homemade teriyaki sauce truly made the dish. I've been back several times since and it's definitely becoming one of my favourite beaches restaurants."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to go for breakfast and lunch. I come here all the time with my girlfriend and the place never ceases to amaze us with its atmosphere as well as its food. Splurge"}
{"text":"Delicious food made with care and delivered with great service.  I have had the bbq beef sandwich and the chicken curry and both were simply fantastic.  The owners are also very friendly and all visitors are made to feel very welcome.  I plan on visiting again and again."}
{"text":"The place is not fancy at all, but the food is fantastic. The staff and homey interior will make you feel like you're having dinner amongst friends. The food never disappoints, with extremely authentic Japanese curries and comfort foods, with some interesting twists of their own. Expect a heavy meal though, this is not light eating!"}
{"text":"Very nice stop to have soothing green tea and a snack of croquettes.  I just chose this place in random and find that it gives that feeling of relaxing vibe you need to start a quiet weekend. No hurried pace, no urgency.  Just a good cup of tea and a snack that hits that spot"}
{"text":"We came here as a group for a birthday party and they were gracious enough to accommodate our party of 11.   The downside - it was potentially the hottest day of the summer and this place had no A/C so I was melting at my seat. But as soon as I downed a Pina Colada Ice Tea, I felt good again. It was $5 and re-fills were unlimited. Perfect for the hottest day you could imagine.   I opted to try their mixed berries mochi Pancakes ($10)- pancakes made with mochi powder.  The mixed berry sauce was delicious and the pancakes were fluffy and dense. It was too much carbs for one person to finish so I do recommend ordering something else on the menu and sharing the pancakes.  I am a person that loves variety so to just eat pancakes and nothing else, left me unsatisfied.   The owners are super nice and gracious and I will be coming back to try other items on their menu like their Japanese style breakfasts and lunch offerings.  On weekends there is free parking up until 1pm in front of the store and free parking all day long the side streets near the restaurant.   It is a smaller and cozier restaurants so I would call ahead to see if you can make a reservation. They took our reservation as long as we made a deposit :) but for 11 people in a smaller restaurant, it seems reasonable.   Final note - all items on the menu are 'tax included' :)"}
{"text":"This place was a cute little resto by the beach on Queen st.  excellent customer service and the food was delicious. Will definitely go back when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Really cute authentic Japanese restaurant that is not sushi. Really loved the service and omurice. Yummy."}
{"text":"Cute and cozy spot near the beaches! As soon ad you enter the food already smells amazing. Came here for brunch and I honestly wanted to try everything on the menu. As someone who loves Japanese food, I was really excited to see a place that offered brunch options. I appreciate the unique menu offerings and the presentation was great for all the food we ordered. Service was great; the owners are really helpful and patient.   I only have a minor comment for the Onigiri Wafu Set (which comes with tamagoyaki, a big onigiri, soup, and salad)- the onigiri was bigger than I expected and came out hot, which initially made it difficult to eat with hands. I just let it cool down a bit. Maybe having two smaller onigiri instead of one big one would be something to consider. But other than that, I did not expect to get full from the set! Really filling.   Wish I tried their deserts, will come back!"}
{"text":"Super laid back restaurant that serves the most delicious pancakes and french fries. My friends went for brunch and ordered the Matcha Mochi Pancakes, Banana Nutella Pancakes, Taco Fries, and Halo Halo Parfait. The pancakes were delicious,  fluffy, and flavorful especially the matcha sauce. The fries in the taco fries were super crunchy and one of the best fries I have eaten recently. I would just love to eat those plain with ketchup. The halo halo parfait is not the traditional halo halo, it is actually scoops of ice creams with ube sauce and some mochi sheets. Will definitely go back to this place to try the other items in the menu even if it is a but far from downtown. The owners are also very nice!"}
{"text":"I had the strawberry nutella mochi mochi pancake and ordered a matcha cake to go. The mochi mochi pancake was fluffy but did not have the chewiness of a mochi. They were generous with the strawberries and chocolate.  The matcha cake is light in matcha flavor and I would have preferred a more bold green tea flavor. I do like that it wasn't overly sweet. (P.S. The cotton cake is gluten free.)   The restaurant owners are uber nice and love the neighbourhood the restaurant is situated in. They were very friendly and offered my friend and I some places to check out in the area as we picked up our cakes."}
{"text":"Woohoo! I love this place so much! I have to thank Nana for taking me here, because I would of never travelled all the way Southeast towards the beach on my own since I live in Markham!  Nana convinced me to go with her so I agreed and went on a Wednesday night after work to this family ran restaurant for some desserts.  As we walked in, we were greeted immediately by Cecilia and David, the owners of the restaurant and we also met their cute daughter Isabella! All the food they served are very Japanese oriented, and after chatting with Cecilia for a bit, she actually lived in Japan for a long time so no wonder!  We ordered the chocolate and original cheesecake and the hojicha tea.  This place uses Nohohon's tea, so you know you are getting some delicious authentic Japanese tea.  The tea came in an English style tea pot and cups which I though was very elegant, and the tea itself was amazing and was steeped with the right temperature.  Cheesecake, OMG, it was so amazing! I ate it so fast because it was so delicious!  The Original cheesecake I had was flavourful and pretty dense, but not as dense as New York style cheesecake which was perfect for me.  Between the two cakes, I enjoyed the Original Cheesecake more as the chocolate was a little heavy since I was still full from dinner.  5 stars for this restaurant, great tea, great desserts and great service!  I will come here again around spring to try their lunch and dinner menu and the matcha cheesecake!  Who wants to go with me?!"}
{"text":"Adorable spot with delicious food. We got the berry compote Mochi pancakes, and fried chicken. The fried chicken was a bit salty but it paired perfectly with the pancakes. We couldn't get enough  - especially of the compote, it wasn't overly sweet.   The food and tea is served on very cute antique silver trays and ornate china plates.   I would give this place a 5 star but the only draw back was the owners reluctance to give us the 10% off we got when we checked into Isabella's boutique. He was very snarky about giving us the discount, which really took away from our otherwise really pleasant brunch.   Also note. This is a very kid friendly setting!"}
{"text":"Any eatery at the Beaches deserves an extra star just for the vibe of the neighborhood. With it's lush gardens, majestic shade trees and chill atmosphere: eating here is relaxing experience.   Met the cool owner, Dave, who lived and worked in Japan for 10 years. He wanted to share his love of Yoshoku style (Westernized Japanese) food with his home country of Canada. A family business where the restaurant is named after his pretty little daughter, his wife is the cook, and the owner can be found serving the customers and manning the cash register.   HUBBY AND I ORDERED: - Tamagoyaki omelette which was stuffed with bacon, spinach, onions, mushrooms, and cheese. It comes with toast and a side salad. Yummy! - Loco Moco which is rice with a hamburger patty on top, smothered in a delicious savoury gravy. What makes their version special is that they added a grilled pineapple slice and onion rings on top. BIG time comfort food, I was doing my happy food dance. - Halo halo ice cream with a thin layer of mochi on top. Liked the ice cream but would have preferred the mochi layer thicker.  Great food, great staff, great location."}
{"text":"Second time here and we ordered the black sesame ice cream filled mochi, the nutella banana peanut butter pancake, the Vietnamese tea, & the mixed berry pancake.   The only new thing we tried was the ice cream mochi was apparently really good - so much so that i didnt even get to take a picture before it disappeared! It was mochi (rice cake sheet) wrapped around black sesame ice cream (you can choose the flavor).   Will drop by again to try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"The whole family loves this place. Japanese comfort food, unique and delicious deserts, yummy breakfast. We love the curry, omu rice, matcha cloud cake...everything really. And such friendly owners."}
{"text":"A bit out of the way, but this place definitely serves up some unique Japanese dishes. The mochi pancakes were slightly disappointing to me, which was a shame as I was really looking forward to it.   My partner and I came here on a Saturday for brunch. We were instantly greeted once we walked in and seated right away. The decor of the restaurant is very fresh, inviting, and cosy. It looked like a place I could eat mochi ice-cream and read here all day.  Mochi Pancakes with Bacon and Eggs - As mentioned, I wasn't the happiest. I was expecting the egg to be poached as it seemed like it. However, it was fully cooked as I tried to break into it. The pancakes were thick, dense, and a bit dry in my opinion. I had hoped, after reading the other reviews here on Yelp, that at least the pancakes might be moist but alas, it felt like I was eating two flat scones.   Loco Moco (burger patties, egg, onion rings) - Quite a flavorful dish, with a very unique combination of egg and onion rings. It was very good, but not spectacular.   Iced Vietnamese Coffee - This was superb. Too bad there aren't more places downtown that serve Vietnamese coffee like this!   Ube Mochi Ice-cream - Definitely a must try if you're craving something cold and you've just been sticky and sweating buckets.   The staff was super friendly throughout the entire time we were there and very attentive! Not only to my partner and I, but also to many of the other customers.   Personally, I don't think I'll make a return trip here again as I wasn't too thrilled about the food. If you do decide to come on by, I wouldn't recommend the mochi mochi pancakes but there are so many other dishes that looked really good, savory and sweet."}
{"text":"The mochi pancakes are to die for. The teriyaki rice bowl and curry rice bowl also did not disappoint. Great place for breakfast, lunch and afternoon snacks. Vegetarian, vegan and family friendly. So lucky to live close to this place, will be back often."}
{"text":"The owners were so nice and the pancakes we tried were totally delicious! They gave us samples of the cotton cake to try, which I had never heard of before. It was like a light, sweet cheesecake (gluten-free) - so good we bought one! We got to meet sweet Isabella. The only thing missing for me were some comfy couches and candles so I could lounge around for a while longer in this zen place on a cold day!"}
{"text":"This adorable family-run restaurant was the perfect brunch spot for my final brunch of 2017! It's kind of in the middle of nowhere but well worth the trip. The service is warm and friendly, the food is great, and I love the beautiful dinnerware and quaint serving trays that they use! The Japanese food on the menu sounded delicious and I can't wait to try their other offerings! Ordered a pot of Lemon Tango tea which was quite lovely. Both my friend and I went with the Mixed Berry Mochi Mochi Pancakes. That berry sauce was perfection, and the strawberry Pocky stick was a nice touch! The pancakes were light and tasty, but I think I was expecting them to be more akin to actual mochi, texture-wise, so that was a bit of a let-down. I liked their portions as well -- not the usual overwhelmingly-sized dense pancakes you get at most breakfast places. For dessert, we both got mochi ice cream: the flavours we chose were matcha and mango. It's a scoop of ice cream with a mochi skin on top and some powdered sugar. Was a decent end to the meal (and satisfied that mochi craving)!"}
{"text":"Good food at a very reasonable price. Nice environment, very friendly service. Try the Loco-Moco!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, and maybe the morning I came they were just having an off day. This place is east EAST Toronto, and it delivers the quiet, quaint atmosphere of the area. The owners/staff are incredibly kind, and the service is great! Everything does feel personal, and it has a great family-friendly feel! Coffee and conversation flow freely in the space.   The food however was what disappointed me. I ordered the loco moco and my friend ordered the berry pancakes. NOTE: I will admit that my personal biases a probably in part to blame for how I felt about the food, so keep that in mind.   None of the food tasted super hot or fresh. Having always had loco moco in Hawaii (where it was born), I was excited to find it here; but the rice was not fresh and felt mushy and hard (a paradox rice seems to accomplish a lot), the gravy tasted canned, and the whole dish fell pretty flat. The pancakes were way too dense and because of the fact that they were not hot, they felt stale.   Would I come back? Maybe to see if they could do better, because the reviews are all raves, but based on my experience, I don't know if it's wort the trek."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try the restaurant. Finally I could go there this evening. They have great menu which are real Japanese meals. Of course I know that many people think that Japanese dishes which are Sushi, Tempura like that. However, this is not what Japanese people typically eat in Japan. I know this because I am native Japanese. Many Japanese people actually eat western and other cuisines with Japanese influence. This restaurant has a menu that I really like it. It is called yoshoku in Japanese, which means Japanese-style western food. I had a hamburg with ponzu sauce and rice/salad (hamburg is a pan-fried minced beef patty). It was great :) I will go back there!!"}
{"text":"Food 3.5* Service + story behind the restaurant 4*  Read great reviews so went to give it a try. Food was ok but I gave an overall score of 4 because of the conversation  and service I got from the owner. Owned by married couple...Caucasian male runs the front and Filipino wife cooks the food.  I took the strawberry mochi mochi pancakes which were decent but now wow. It had a grainy texture to it compared to the regular pancakes...from the mochi flour used. There was slightly too much syrup on my pancakes so too sweet for me to finish them all.  My sister took an avocado sandwich which was also ok...but kind of hard to screw up as well.  Had a chat with the husband and he told me that his wife lived in Japan for many years hence the Japanese influenced dishes.  Told the husband that I found them in Yelp so he insisted that we try a piece of their cheesecake. It tasted similar to uncle tetsu's.  He also suggested that I pack my remaining pancakes as those with not get mushy even if they have been covered in syrup for a long time...attentive service.  You can really tell that this is a neighbourhood restaurant as there are high chairs available and changing beds in the lady's room.  Overall decent place and nice to encourage neighbourhood restaurants."}
{"text":"Great service. The mochi pancakes were fully and delicious. I now need to figure out how to make the green tea syrup!  Soooo good! The only thing I do have to comment is they have a limited dessert menu and when they sell out you are out of luck. There was one late afternoon my husband and I came in to have dessert and they only had a chocolate cupcake. Nothing else....so we did leave disappointed. However, if they have everything in stock try the cheesecake!"}
{"text":"This is a very nice boutique restaurant. Although it's a bit dated but service was very friendly and food is definitely outstanding. Nicky mouse pancake definitely cute and my daughter loves it. Sakura sencha was a bit light but very aromatic. Beef omelette: cream egg, cheesy and beef was so tender. The salad dress so nice, very well balance. Mochi pancake with fried chicken. Chicken was tender and juicy and pancake was a bit chewy. Just like Mochi but personally I like fluffy pancakes more. Melon pan was freshly baked and it's just like a scone. Last by not least, Mochi with red bean and strawberry.m, it's not over sweeten. Just perfect for me."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place late in the afternoon while in the east end of the the city.  They have an interesting menu with a variety of options.  I had a breakfast sandwich and a curry poutine.  The breakfast sandwich was a breakfast sandwich.  The sandwich was on an English muffin.  Fresh.  Decent.  The curry poutine was delicious!  The flavour of the sauce reminded me of the fish and chip shops from back home in England.  Ah the nostalgia.  With their friendly staff and unique offerings I would certainly recommend it!  I plan to go back myself to try some of their supper items."}
{"text":"Very cute brunch place in the beaches! Pretty small spot with really good service. It's a nice change from the super busy and pretentious brunch places that are overly popular right now. I love mochi ice cream and had no idea what to expect from the mochi pancakes, but it was just overall fluffy goodness! Tried both the matcha and Nutella & banana mochi pancakes and both were delicious! Also had the avocado toast which was also really good."}
{"text":"Cute and cozy spot for brunch by the beaches. The owner is so chill, which is reflected by the interior and mood. Must try the Mochi Mochi pancakes. Soft and dense and chewy. Very rich matcha flavour if you order the matcha ones. Also ordered the karaage meal. Chicken was on point. Crispy and not oily. Came with a great sweet and savory sauce. The only constructive feedback would be for the veggies which could be fresher and less chop suey. Still enough for a 5 star rating in my book!"}
{"text":"Japanese fusion lives here. Whether you are craving breakfast, a snack, dessert, or a main course dinner, you really have to try this place. My favorite dish here is the Japanese curry, and for dessert, you really have to their green tea pancakes. Everything here is very fresh and flavorful. The restaurant itself is very clean and inviting, and its owned and operated by a husband and wife team who are very passionate about food. If you come here just once, I know you will be back again, because I was :)"}
{"text":"Really good homestyle Japanese food! It's a quaint restaurant with a small but quality menu and good service.  I got the Japanese curry with chicken served with rice and mixed berry mochi pancakes, and my partner got the curry udon. Delicious! The curry tastes just as it should be, savory and smooth and the chicken was pan fried perfectly. It had squash and green beans and those paired very well with the dish. The curry udon is like the same as the rice dish except with udon, udon was chewy and soft. The pancakes were definitely unique, its texture is similar to a soft scone but chewier. Tasted very good with the berry sauce. Another great meal at the beaches!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! Our wheat allergic son is able to be accommodated with the gluten free mochi pancakes and gluten free bread available. I have gotten the avocado tamagoyaki omelette every time. It's filling and delicious. It comes with a fresh roll that is warm and melts the butter....drool. My husband loves the curry! The desserts are delicious. We're tried the cotton cake and the an pan ice cream sandwich. The service is always polite and friendly. Based on the above, I would rate this place. 5, however I've given a four because sometimes the washroom has been a bit unclean and a few times we went one of the toilets was out of order, so there was only 1 toilet for the entire restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here today with my friends for brunch and ordered the Loco Moco along with the mochi mochi pancakes (we got matcha, mix berry and nutella to share). Presentation was very cute and the restaurant had a nice ambiance. Staff are friendly.  The loco moco was ok, but I had a lot of leftover rice. It definitely looked better than it tasted though. 3.5/5 not bad but not great.   I was REALLY hyped about the mochi mochi pancakes after seeing them from the blogTO video but I was really let down. I love mochi and always get mochi waffles at Mabu Station and other Asian cafes in Toronto. They're delicious because they're chewy and share that elastic consistency which makes mochi so great. The mochi mochi pancakes at Isabella's cut like regular pancakes do and does not stretch like mochi is supposed to. It is denser and thicker than your regular pancakes, but it definitely is not chewy like mochi.  If I was looking for regular pancakes I would have been very satisfied. But I came for MOCHI pancakes and it simply did not deliver. 1/5 for the mochi mochi pancakes that turned out to be not mochi at all."}
