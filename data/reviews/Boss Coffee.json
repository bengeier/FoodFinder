{"text":"One of the best coffee shops I have been to in this area! The coffee is great, but the ambiance is amazing. I have been coming here almost day while I study for a huge exam and this place cannot have better vibes for studying or even just hanging out. Everyone who works here is super friendly and I absolutely love the feel."}
{"text":"So modern and clean inside love the interior design......unfortunately the coffee was not so good, and it smells kind of weird in there not sure if it's the espresso or what.   Great place to get work done no over crowded like Starbucks. The coffee needs to be vamped up. I've been a Barista, and gone to many coffee shops and the coffee needs something here...I think they need better syrups, and really work on ratio of ice/milk/espresso.   There really over priced too... But there also new so they are still establishing there signature drinks I'm sure! I still think this is a great place."}
{"text":"I have tried Boss Coffee 2 times now.  I live near by and was excited for a drive through coffee place.    1st experience - was shortly after they opened. I ordered a 20oz Vanilla Frappe.  The taste was good and I enjoyed the drink.  However after I finished the drink I noticed on the bottom of cup it said 16oz. So I paid almost $6 for a 20oz and only got a 16oz drink.  2nd experience - I went yesterday to give them another shot at this.  Ordered the same drink again with no whipped cream.  I had 3 girls come to the drive through window. 1 took my money, 1 asked if it was no whipped cream and 1 that handed me the drink.  I took one look at the drink and asked the girl... Are you sure this is a 20oz drink?  She said YES.   Again I paid for a 20oz Frappe at almost $6 and got a 16oz drink.   I would post a picture of the cup however don't have a way to download the picture.   Very sad when they have 2 size Frappe drinks and can not get the larger from the smaller figured out not once but twice in one month.    I can go across the street and get a 24 oz Frappe at Starbucks and pay only $4.83 and get what I paid for.  Bottom line for me... ALWAYS make sure you are getting what you paid for. These employees are not aware of there own size drinks.  The Frappe drinks are way overpriced IMO."}
{"text":"Finally a GREAT coffee spot in N Scottsdale!  Fast friendly staff and great ambiance.  Internet speed is blazing fast.  Went here on Fri and had a hazelnut latte and blueberry muffin.  Best hazelnut latte I've had - watch out Starbucks there's a new boss in town!"}
{"text":"I tried Coffee Boss for the first time this morning. I was running late and didn't get a chance to make a cappuccino at home. We roast our own coffee at home, so we are not fans of the burnt taste of Starbucks' coffee and we are always looking for good coffee shops that offer higher quality coffee.  I was very surprised with their cappuccino and we will definitely come back and try more items soon. While ordering my drink, I noticed they had a kale salad, I'll have to try it next time.   Excited to have a new coffee shop in this neighborhood where we can enjoy a nice cup of coffee!"}
{"text":"I have been on a mission to discover all of the independent coffee shops in the WORLD!  Or at least in the Phoenix area.  Boss Coffee is at the top of the list.    The cold brew is excellent.  Complex and smooth.  The hot tea selection includes some interesting choices, including a green tea with some unique tones.    The shop itself looks great inside.  Very clean, professionally decorated, with a great semi-exposed ceiling.  Overall, they made a small space seem big.    The best part is the outdoor patio.  Nice selection of outdoor tables, chairs and couches.    Love this place."}
{"text":"Gorgeous place!  By far the coolest coffee shop I've been too.  My coffee was delicious, the wifi is fast, seats are comfortable, atmosphere is perfect to get some work done or meet with someone. Love it!"}
{"text":"They don't have plugs so you can't really use your computer to do work or any kind. I get the idea they want people to buy things and leave but it doesn't sit well with me. Not coming back. Coffee isn't any different than a local Starbucks. Don't come here if you want a quiet place to do work"}
{"text":"Decent coffee place.  I liked it.  Nice seating inside and out.  Outside area has decent shade and comfy seating with a view of the mountains.  You can camp out with the lap top if needed.  It's a nice add to my trip down Scottsdale road. They have a nice selection of teas too."}
{"text":"Moden, clean, good customer service, great place to study or to hang out with friends. Anazing view of the city"}
{"text":"Amazing place, the quality of their coffee is always consistent and they have the best cold brew in town!"}
{"text":"My first visit to Boss Coffee today. I had iced brewed coffee drive thru. Coffee was really good. It's much better than Starbucks, smooth and deep. I was very happy to discover a locally owned coffee shop in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Food, excellent.... coffee on tap (literally) !Usually I get excited about growlers of beer, but you can get growlers of coffee ! Highly recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"Super good incredible tasting cold brewed coffee! Not too strong and the flavoring for the caramel, mocha, and vanilla all taste of high quality. They have take out bottle for iced brewed coffee to take home. You can reuse it to bring back to purchase more. The atmosphere is beautiful and classy. Well done interior design!!!  Outside seating is nothing great but it is dog friendly. The staff is so nice. Even when busy and the line is backed up - they treat each person like you just walked in and they have been waiting for you. How refreshing that was for me each time.  Oh! And when I have used the drive through it went quickly and, again, friendly.  Muffins are quite good.  I only wish they were closer to me because I have to go out of my way to get my bottle refilled of cold brew.  I will NOT give that up - it's waaaaay too delicious. So out of my way I go with a smile on my face and drooling starting because I can't wait!"}
{"text":"It has a great atmosphere and really yummy coffee.  I've only been once but I'm sure I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Nice, clean environment.  Friendly service and a fabulous latte.  This barista knows what she's doing; no need to cover up this smooth espresso with sugar/syrup.  Looking forward to seeing more locations."}
{"text":"LOVE the iced tea! A little pricey but a great atmosphere and perfect place to work with lots of outlets and chargers"}
{"text":"The coffee is great, and the food is okay. Decor is awesome and the music is soothing. Our food took a while and was barely warm. The staff was friendly and the vibe is great. I had the passion fruit black tea and loved it!"}
{"text":"Unique. Love the name as it fits the North Scottsdale area. I think the drive-thru is efficient and their baristas are very pleasant. Will suggest to others to check this spot out."}
{"text":"Cute new spot, they have good coffee, GREAT WELCOMING SERVICE!  but the only small detail. They need Ice coffee! But I like how mellow, and the decor with such a great view, relaxes you while you enjoy a cup of latte. Coffee taste way better than Starbucks! Prices are good!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give it more stars... I had high hopes... maybe it's an off day... however... my coffee was lukewarm... Actually it wasn't a coffee it was a latte (tasted like a watered down dunkin coffee)... I figure the best way to test a new coffee shop is by ordering a latte and a scone, if they have one, my luck they had both! Would you like that warm? he asked (thinking back now he might have meant the latte)... Why of course I do! I was excited at this point... They also had coconut milk! I love love love a creamy yummy frothy coconut milk latte! Of which they did not have here... my son got the Indian chai tea iced which was delicious (from concentrate im sure) that's why I gave it 2 stars... However my latte was terrible! Two sips and i couldnt even finish it... just the thought of a third sip made me mad for spending the 12$ I had spent... dont get me started on the 'fresh (warmed) pastry'!  There is NO WAY this is made inhouse THAT IS WHAT FRESH MEANS!  I'm so disappointed...  oh so sad!"}
{"text":"Great cold brew, quiet place to be productive and nice views outside!"}
{"text":"Dynamite. So lovely, it was like going to a spa! The patio is wonderful in the nice cool of the morning. Good that they open at 7! The coffee was wonderful, service terrific, atmosphere and ambiance so calming and wonderful. That and the pastry (I got a chocolate stick) was like chocolate strudel! Delicious! Good job guys-I hope your business continues to flourish! I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"On Wednesday I was passing through AZ and happened to stop at this shop. Not only was the coffee amazing and fresh, but the drop dead gorgeous girl with the pink orange hair and niiiiiice cheek highlight at the counter was one of the sweetest cashiers/baristas I've ever met. She accommodated my big and complicated order. I was so grateful for someone who shines like her on my long drive!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this local coffee house but was really let down. I saw the reviews were mixed but decided I'd make my own mind up... I wasn't impressed, the girl upfront was unpleasant. She seemed like she showed up just for the pay check. She wasn't helpful, she didn't recommend anything and she was short. The girl working the drive thru seemed nice, but she did t really help me.   The cold brew coffee wasn't good, and was bitter. I got my brother a white mocha and he drank his and I thought that was good. My sister had a latte and she said it was bad. All around this visit wasn't good, I will not be going back."}
{"text":"The decor and the view outside is beautiful. That said, Boss Coffee lacks the most essential component of a coffee shop, the coffee!  The French-roast Nitro Cold Brew tasted burnt and it was not smooth. The nitrogen was probably not infused properly. I've had buttery smooth nitro cold brew, and Boss coffee's was nothing close to it. The salted caramel latte was basically a salted latte, very faint caramel taste.  Furthermore, the toilet paper serrations make the TP sheets twice as small as normal! Is it a passive aggressive way of telling me that I'm fat?  If u want good coffee, I would not recommend Boss Coffee. Maybe other items on the menu are better, but I don't think I'll be back to explore."}
{"text":"extremely good coffee, excellent location. little more trendy than I'm usually comfortable with, but if it works for them it works for me."}
{"text":"I was surprised at how nice it was when I went inside. Definitely a place I can see myself spending a lot of time at.  The coffee was really good. Beats any chain coffee shop. Glad to have it in the neighborhood! They have a drive-thru."}
{"text":"This was only my first time here but I really enjoyed it. The staff was excellent and the coffee was delicious. The place was also quiet, as opposed to Starbucks which tends to have a lot of banging and commotion around. i would definitely make this my regular coffee spot."}
{"text":"This is a pretty chill coffee place. The ambient is really nice and relaxing. I got the cold brew ice coffee with almond milk and vanilla flavor light roast. The cold brew is smooth and delicious.  Also l decided to get a croissant which taste great as well"}
{"text":"Amazing, the personas of locale. Drive just 40 minutes north of downtown Phoenix and you leave its eccentricities behind. Gone are the converted house coffee shops. Gone the sagging structures, kaleidoscopic murals. Malls replace the history of homes. Sidewalks here are manicured and white. There are no potholes.  Rising from the earth of this luxury precision, located as one might expect amongst a miniature menagerie of shops, Boss Coffee greets an opulent community with flare. Large signs hang from its front and from its side, announcing its arrival to the world of high-end cars and desert mansions.  10 minutes south of here, exotic cars line dealership after sparkling moneyed dealership. (30 minutes south of that, tired sweating homeless line the streets.)  Inside the shiny entrance, Boss Coffee is a masterpiece of unconstrained design: plush white leather stools stand at attention under lavish hanging fixtures. Every wall is bursting with décor. Sweeping displays of artwork draw your gaze. Every last detail is in absolute alignment with the next.  Even the menu is a testament to wealth: it shouts at you from four egregious screens. Pastries, an exhibit all their own, recline in tantalizing rows behind a swooping glass display - spotless, posed, and delicately lit.  MY (VERY) PERSONAL TAKE  Boss Coffee is attractive, staged, and obstinately sterile. Compared with the grit and honesty of its urban competition, the atmosphere feels stuffy and affected. Still, like a Ferrari, you must value its precision (convenience and design are careful arts).  I visited an hour before close on a Sunday. Nearly two months since it's opening. Service was very quick, though disaffected. The dirty chai I ordered was sickly sweet to me, but that's subjective. (I discarded after drinking barely half.)  Spacious, bright, and clean with abundant seating, Boss Coffee was empty except for one small group and me. I was personally incapable of settling into the space and so I left. (UNLIKE both of the downtown Phoenix coffee shops I'd visited earlier today, no one bade farewell as I withdrew.)  CONCLUSION  So would I visit Boss Coffee again? Honestly, I wouldn't. It's simply not a fit for my (admittedly hipster) sensibilities. Would I dissuade you, dear reader, from visiting? Absolutely not.  If nothing else, go to admire elements of design, meticulous particulars of convenience. (This is where Boss Coffee wins its stars.) Peruse the lengthy menu and establish a conclusion of your own.  :)"}
{"text":"Boss coffee had a cool vibe, but the coffee was a little different. My cold brew had a wood flavor to it which was different. The price was average as well as the coffee."}
{"text":"The most delicious vanilla latte Ive ever had in my entire life. I drink a lot of coffee I travel all over and try new coffee shops all the time. This place is by far the best!!! Would love to try the food some time! Bravo!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop here after experiencing being ignored just down the way at Egg and Joe... thank you Boss Coffee for making my morning..with delicious tea, snack and friendly service!!"}
{"text":"Great green tea selection, breakfast wrap I had was veryyyyy yummy and the view is very nice. Wifi access, charging cords available, staff is very friendly and plenty of parking. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere and Lovely staff!  Provide charging cables for many smartphones. Ordered an low fat ice chai latte, the best one I have ever had! Creamy and sweet it was excellent."}
{"text":"Boss Coffee rocks!  Great coffee, cute coffeehouse, delicious quinoa bowl. Finally a coffeehouse in North Scottsdale to sit and sip without all the drama that goes on in Starbucks stores."}
{"text":"Boss Coffee is great - you need to give it a try!  The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly and they will point you in the right direction if you have any questions.  I thought both the coffee and the pastries were quite good - far superior to Starbucks.  I am a hot coffee drinker but they have a \"cold brew\" which seems to be very popular.  In addition, it is a really cool space with excellent WiFi and some very interesting decor.  Outside seating that is dog-friendly as well if you want to bring your mutt.  All in all, just a great place for your morning cup of coffee, I would highly recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"I've been anticipating this place for awhile. Does it live up to my expectations? Yes and no. The inside is nice and well designed (except for the fake plants), and it looks very modern. I'm not especially big on the brightness however; I prefer my coffee shops dark and cozy.  The coffee itself is tasty. I got a 20 oz large which looked more like a 24 oz, so that was nice. The drink was smooth but not weak. One thing I thought was a bit ridiculous was the price for an extra shot - $1.00. I expected a double shot for $1, but it was per shot. Since every drink comes with 2 (which is pretty weak for a large), to get my regular 4 shots I have to pay $2 extra. With soy milk, that brings the price over $7. Too expensive.   The girl helping me was very nice and personable. The other employee (owner, manager?) was okay, but not as friendly.  I will be back, but I'm afraid at $7 for my drink it won't be a frequent spot. Also, it's nice they have a drive-through and a patio, but since they close at 6 it's kind of hard to enjoy the sunset or the early night. Wish they were open til at least 7."}
{"text":"Nice new spot on North Scottsdale, good plug in situation and outdoor and indoor areas to chill."}
{"text":"Just happened upon this joint, looked pretty cool. Once inside, I really liked the decor. Only issue, there were cold brew growlers EVERYWHERE!!! There was more self promotion inside than at the typical Star@ucks.  I had a latte, it was good. My mom had a white mocha, she said it was real good, as it wasn't overly sweet, and she could truly taste the mocha aspect of it. It's really out of my way to come here, as I live in Mesa, but I may just bring my wife here on a Saturday morning. I'm tempted to try to cold brew, but am hesitant it will be too strong, as it seems that's a consistent review. All in all, if I was local, I'd probably come here once a week."}
{"text":"Went for the first time and the customer service is outstanding. Had a coffee and scone... delicious. Decor is welcoming. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"It was totally dead on a Sunday morning, unlike Starbucks.  I was thinking it would be a step up and it was.  Cold atmosphere, but beautifully decorated.  The coffee was really good, but my cappuccino was served in a very small cup, not a cappuccino mug and about 1/4 the size of what a cappuccino should be,  making it a pretty pricey cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Very cool inside, lot of seating as well as bar usable for standing. Good coffee as well, I got a Tahitian Vanilla Latte!"}
{"text":"Roaster is Stumptown which is great coffee but nothing unique to area. Service was disorganized and breakfast options limited."}
{"text":"Really cute coffee place with ample outlets and seating for lap tops and studying. I was looking forward to trying out this place for awhile and was very disappointed with my first visit.   I got the Tahitian vanilla latte with almond milk. Not sure if the quality of their almond milk is good or if the barista was lacking craftsmanship, but my latte tasted incredibly watery with hardly any taste of espresso. My fiancé had a chai tea which also tasted watery.   Not a huge deal but the cashier asked if we would be staying in or getting our drinks to go and I let her know it was \"for here.\" Our drinks came in \"to go\" form so I didn't get to experience the cool foam art in a latte mug as seen in pics on yelp."}
{"text":"First time  here . I Usually go to SB or DB .. It wa $8.02 for a tall non fat latte coffee and a small croissant . Is a bit steep I would say ,  coffee has an odd taste to it . Like old fashioned camp liquid coffee if the reader knows what that is . Almost a liquid smoke taste . Nice decor good location although hidden in a corner , I hope they make it,but price is always a factor , I Also noticed that no change count came from the young girl on front counter , was Just handed a bundle of coinage , i assune it was 98 cents and i put it in the tip jar ( she didn't rhank me and I didn't  have to tip her either)  - tips  are not mandatory anywhere  , Did i get  correct change?  , no idea . Memo to owners , Customers want change counted back from a $20 bill or any other bill .. Good luck here I hope it does well but prices are steeep . Not everyone around here is affluent or making lots of money ."}
{"text":"Very good coffee-drive through was awesome so we didn't have to get out. We had the cold brew-yum!!! Signed up for their app and got $3 off too."}
{"text":"My family and I love and enjoy Boss Coffee so much! It is our go to and the drive thru is so convenient. Service is always excellent as well as the coffee. Definitely a step above Starbucks. They also have almond milk as well as coconut milk, a huge plus!! The interior is also very nice and not too overwhelming."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place to grab coffee, hang out and have a a good conversation, or study/work. I generally come here to get some work done because the wifi is blazing fast and there are chargers provided with lots of outlets. I've been coming here over a few years now and they've always provided excellent service to me. This is my favorite coffee shop in Phoenix.  Coffee - the nitro cold brew is fantastic. I always get the cortado, which is similar to a flat white except more texture. The regular brew coffee changes every now and then but I've always found it to be aromatic and freshly brewed. Their frappes (blended) are good too but I'm less of a fan of overly sweet drinks in general. I've only had the chocolate croissant and it was pretty standard.  Ambiance - extremely clean, urban modern interior with unique lights, chairs and tables, and a living wall (with fake plants but still nice). There's always plenty of seating inside and out.  They have lots of shade to sit under outside and they have misters to keep it cool. Lots of parking in the plaza as well.  If you're in a rush, you can also get anything from the drive through."}
{"text":"I read all of the glowing reviews and was very excited to try out the coffee for myself. Boy was I disappointed. The staff was not friendly, the prices were very high which is okay except the quality was not there and I threw away my coffee before I was even halfway done with it. Waste of $6. Three stars because the location was was beautiful."}
{"text":"I noticed this new coffee shop and had to investigate. I'm always looking for a better coffee shop. I love that they have coconut and almond milk for creamers! I only got a medium roast coffee and it was perfect."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a hot tea as it's my husband's new favorite study place. I now see why! Great location, killer selection of teas, comfy decor, and friendly, helpful staff. I highly recommend this local coffee shop!"}
{"text":"It is in the same parking lot as Sprouts, off of Scottsdale Rd and N. Pinnacle Peak, so I went inside to try it out. I ordered their espresso, and to be honest, it was just OK. I have tasted better. In fact, after a few minutes, it was quite bitter. This usually means that they just got a new espresso machine, or they don't clean it well. Most Americans get the sugary-ice cream delights, so all that sugary cream covers up the bitterness. The decor is nice, clean and the wifi worked excellent. The staff were pleasant."}
{"text":"What a great coffee spot! Near the location where I'm working when in town, and they have a convenient drive thru. The iced chai latte must be made of unicorn dust because it is so incredibly tasty you want to drink nothing else for the rest of your life. Basically, if you are near here, go here."}
{"text":"So refreshing to stumble upon a killer coffee spot that knows their beans and can put that their know how to good use in a great latte.  Super knowledgeable staff, killer beans, homemade vanilla if you want it sweet!  So happy to find good coffee close to the trails saving me from the overly burnt nasty of Starbucks."}
{"text":"I was somewhat concerned, but a bit excited when I saw that they had a drive thru. I wasn't sure if the drive-thru would take away from their ambiance, but let me tell you, it does not. I opted to go inside and get the full experience and was not disappointed, the lighting inside is fantastic, not too bright and not too dark. There is also outside seating, and on a nice day, you can get a decent view (if there isn't too much traffic). I got a regular ice coffee, as that is my go-to drink of choice. Some of the best-smoothest, ice coffee that I have ever had, and it was not even cold brew. The barista's know their menu, which is nice, pastries looked good, you can also order sandwiches and salads. I am excited to come back and try a warm beverage, prices are reasonable for the area."}
{"text":"New place in my neighborhood and I'm liking what I'm seeing. Great coffee priced better than any place in the area including THAT coffee giant chain. I enjoyed a tasty flat white and look forward to trying an iced cold brew next visit."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru for coffee before getting our car washed. The service was fast and the coffee was good. I got a medium (16oz) iced americano with nothing in it so  I could really taste the flavor of the espresso and it has a buttery and silky taste. Really enjoyed my morning coffee!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a refreshing green tea at Boss coffee today.  It was reasonably priced and the service was quick. We stayed to enjoy our drink and liked the decor here.  Although the sweet treats available looked delicious, we did not sample them today.  Will definitely be a return customer.  Might try the Chai tea next time."}
{"text":"One of the best little independent coffee shops I have ever been too.  I found them while here for work and repeatedly came back each day till I left.   They have a great selection of tea and coffee and even have growlers that you can take coffee home with you :)  Amazing idea.  Loved it and the atmosphere of the place."}
{"text":"The team at boss is great. Nothing better than a great attitude along with your coffee to get you going!"}
{"text":"Walk in tired, walk out a Boss! Like for real! This place is amazing!!! Their coffee is so smooth and flavorful, yet not that burnt coffee flavor (like other places), just great coffee yumminess. And their nitrobrew... omg! Coffee heaven, I tell you! Pure awesomeness in a cup -- sure to give you a nice jolt and wake you up!  The shop itself is very cute, inviting, and cozy. And I absolutely love the sassy signs/decor inside... made me feel like home. Not to mention, there are outlets near every table, so you don't have to worry if you're here and your electronics need some juice.   The staff is extremely friendly and the drinks they whip up are magical... I ordered the Salted Caramel Latte, just less sweet. It was oh so glorious, and gave me my coffee and sweet fix all in one. Score!   Also... they have DRIVE THRU!!! What?! Yaassss!!! So now you can get amazing Boss Coffee from the comfort of your own car... like a boss. Yup. This place makes you feel just like a boss -- the coffee, the atmosphere, the service, everything."}
{"text":"Top notch Decor. Coffee. Ambience.  Great selection. iPhone and android chargers built into tables. Fast wifi.  North Phoenix/ Scottsdale needed this a shop like this. Well done Boss Coffee - will return before I head back to CA."}
{"text":"We used to love the coffee AND food, but the food tastes a day old. I asked them to remake it, and when they brought it back they dropped the plate on the table. The service was uncaring and unprofessional. Food came out before they could serve drip coffee. Not sure what's going on at this establishment, but we are very disappointed since we use to enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"Good coffee. Good to have coffee shop on this side of town. Need more than 20oz size though"}
{"text":"I've only been twice since it's opening in February but already a big fan of this place. Clearly, they know their coffee. The cold brew is tasty and their lattes are delicious too. I'm all for supporting locally owned business and will come here before that \"other\" coffee place every time. Also, this place has a drive thru...but I'd recommend checking out the inside of this place too. Feels like a high end coffee den suitable for a business meeting or first date. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow. Can you even get a better latte? They really know what the heck they're doing here at this local fun coffee shop!!! The beans are roasted to the definition of perfection. That baristas are super kind. They even let me smell the beans!!! Incredible. 10/5 would recommend. Come here now."}
{"text":"I thought it was my imagination... 2 eggs on my croissant breakfast? I thought of asking because it sure seemed a mistake... But it wasn't, and now I know why they call it 'Boss' But Even better is the croissant... I have not had a fresher croissant in this city. The croissant was the flakiest and best... I also tried their version of a Chai Tea latte and it certainly did not dissapppoint either. I'm a breakfast junkie and I can say this place is on point. The deco is easy, and simply cool. So this spot sits as boss & a hidden gem in the middle of almost  nowhere."}
{"text":"Service is always great and personable. Many choices in terms of coffee and tea and there specialty appears to o be their Cold Brew. I have never had a bad cup of coffee here. One complaint, they don't offer a 12 ounce fresh brew so you have to get the 16. Other than that it's all good--especially the view of the McDowell Mountains."}
{"text":"They really put a lot of time and the ought into the design- very cool and welcoming with plenty of sits both K side and out to relax.  Drive through if you're in hurry - great general coffee but I'm update my review once I try some fancy stuff.  Very hip chill place for coffee and studying"}
{"text":"Cutest local coffee place. If you've never been here, I recommend going inside because its very appealing. Drinks are always delicious! Drive through is super convenient."}
{"text":"Great coffee, great food, cool environment and free charging stations. Really freaking love this place. Wish there was one in tucson. They also have a cold brew and nitro on tap! When I'm in town I usually grab few growlers of cold brew for the road! Perfect spot for studying/reading or check out the drive through for a quick grab and go."}
{"text":"Love this place. It is by far my favorite coffee shop in Phoenix. Very nice staff here and great coffee."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Smooth lattes and delicious scones. Great atmosphere and music and fast wifi. Stop by it's a gem!!!"}
{"text":"Easily the best coffee north of the 101. A well appointed and designed space (with a few questionable decor items straight from Great Aunt Merlene's attic), lend to a classy metropolitan coffee house experience. Leather chairs and stools, a charger for each and ever bar seat make it the perfect second home. And it's not all hot air, the coffee is perfect. I can't wait to see where this place goes!  Though, it closes a bit early -- extended hours would really allow one to take advantage of the sunsets from the huge patio."}
{"text":"The stars are for the decorating and the lovely ambiance, but I doubt I'll go back for the coffee or the service.    I have ordered the same variety of coffee by the type of beans each time I have gone.  One time so burned that my hubby and I had to pour it out.    Another time warm and watery.  Sprouts coffee which has sat in a hot pot half a day tastes just as good.  The service varies depending upon who is working but when I tip someone a dollar for a small cup of black coffee, I expect a simple thank you.  Never happens.  Just plain rude and arrogant.    I notice from the comments that the baristas do not talk to those in line in their cars ... well they don't talk to the patrons inside either! ... they just talk to each other like chatty teenagers.    I enjoy a change of pace coffee when I'm out, but trust me, I can make better at home."}
{"text":"I was not so happy about this place. The girls in there looked at me like I was stupid for asking a few coffee questions. I also told them to stir my coffee and they did not do so, I over heard the girl ask the other one if she stired the coffee and she said she forgot, that's fine and all but at least apologize when you recognize you made a oopp's. The actual way the place was kept was very nice, I love that animals are welcome, they have outside seating and the plants that hang."}
{"text":"Great local coffee shop. Went for the first time on Sunday and will definitely be back. They have a great selection of coffee, tea, pastries and small bites. I think they did a great job offering something for everyone. Whether you are grabbing a coffee before work (they have drive-thru), need a place to read or study, or meeting for a date it fits the bill in all areas. Great, trendy decor with a cozy, laid back vibe."}
{"text":"Great coffee good ambiance. Love the leather barstools. Husbands salted caramel latte was not overly sweet. My cappuccino was served in a nice ceramic mug and was Hot and strong. Will definitely return"}
{"text":"I think (yup i like this place)i like this place i had a chia tea with expresso and its really good. The prices are high but worth it... (I wonder if they have a punch card?) and they are tucked in the corner. They have cold brew coffee....i bought some for my son just so he could have the jug. I think they might have a drive thru too but not sure. Great job staff!! Thank you for the help and the taste test yum!!! Watch out starbucks and dutch brothers. You may have some competition brewing!!!  This is a must try. I will be back and bringing friends!!!"}
{"text":"Very bad service for breakfast! They forgot my coffee and our bagels to finally serve us the wrong bagels after waiting for 15 minutes ......."}
{"text":"They do coffee like a Boss !  This place rocks my coffee socks off, from the moment you walk in, you're in for a treat!!  The decor here is very contemporary, modern, and sleek, fast Wi-Fi with an assortment of IPhone & Android chargers built into the table top, incredible views of the McDowell Mountains & comfortable seating on the patio.  What a perfect place to sip your coffee & enjoy the majestic views.    Oh boy do I love Lattes, and cold brew coffee ! And OMG does this place hit the nail on the head !!  Everything I've had so far was the BOMB.com!!    My Latte was a custom Sugar free hazelnut / vanilla 10 oz with the perfect amount of froth ! Dang the nuttiness of the coffee was so intense it that it made my taste buds dance.    I liked the fact that they have cold brew coffee on Tap and growlers to go.  I hear that they're  in the works of getting a liquor license, so in the future they will have Wine & beer. I'm not sure I'd enjoy a coffee infused with liquor as I drink it for the caffeine rush and adding liquor to it might just ruin that effect.  But I'll try anything once.    The bathrooms were nicely done & have always been clean !  The baked goods look temping but they aren't made in house bummer.    They have a drive through if you're in a hurry but if you have the time I recommended going inside & taking a peek at the patio the views are just majestic.  I'm lucky to live in the neighborhood, so Boss coffee is a gem to me.    I have my favorites but I won't compare.  Boss coffee is now in my top 3 shops that I prefer!!  way to go and thank you for my caffeine rush when I visit you guys.    The customer service is good the girls are friendly & they are still learning the Latte Art! I let them practice on mine because practice makes perfect right.      Thank you again and may you're business flourish   Enjoy coffee lovers"}
{"text":"I have been to Boss Coffee a few times now. I was very impressed my first time because the cashier was friendly and helpful and told us to have a seat and she will bring our drinks to us. I thought that was a great touch to this shop! But, the other times I have been there they haven't been doing that. I think it makes it a welcoming environment.   The latte macchiato, iced or hot, is delicious even if you add flavor! The cold brew is very strong and has nice bite to it. I was turned off by the fact that you have to pay for whipped cream, I've never been to a shop here that does that. Also, their large only has 2 shots and an extra shot is $1, which I believe is too much especially since shots are typically pulled in twos. (Reasons why I took off 1 star)  The ambience is excellent and I like that it is bright, well-lit and has a cute patio. There is no other shop in the valley that is beautifully decorated as Boss. It's a great place to study because the booths are comfortable and the music is calm. I do wish that they would extend their hours a little longer because it is the only coffee shop in the area that is open later and is a study spot.   I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"A nice little coffee shop! Glad it was added, now I can stop for a tasty tea to sip on as I do my Sprouts shopping. I like that there's a drive through, and that is what I did this time. One small detail that is nice is that the menu for the drive through is easy to read haha, I always hate when I go to a drive through, don't have my glasses, and can't read anything.  There were only like 2 cars in front of me, and the line moved quick! I ordered a sunset green iced tea. I was a little disappointed that there were only two options for iced tea, but my green tea was very very tasty so I can't complain too much! The little outdoor seating area was nice too. I plan to come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Let's be honest. Who doesn't like coffee?  Well if you do, Boss Coffee has raised the bar! By far the nicest coffee shop I've ever been to.   Service is top notch. They are polite, courteous, and genuinely care about your experience.  The coffee is refreshingly not Star-Chucks. It has a smooth and easy flavor and creamy goodness to it.  Very well balanced acidity with a warm nutty finish.  Atmosphere is well above par for the area and the area is very nice. Patio is dog friendly and the views are amazing. It is a great place to hang out, get some sun, read a book and indulge in decadent coffee.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went to this drive thru doe first thinking I'd give the smaller coffee place a shot.  Drive thru person took seven minutes to even greet me.  Then finally took my money..with no greeting.  She then gave me my change with the coins on top of the receipt and. I'll causing them to fall.(PLEASE teach people how to hand change correctly)  Then my coffee was given to me....hot coffee which wasn't hot.  Never again.  Smaller places HAVE to try harder and for sure get friendly right.  They didn't"}
{"text":"This place is so cute! I went out of my way to come here and try their coffee since I've heard so many good things. I love the decor- some have said it's sterile and I would agree, however I really like that! I think I'm over the hipster, pretentious coffee shop vibe there is a lot of in Phoenix. The employees were all super friendly- one girl was outside on the patio when I walked up and she immediately said hello and held the door for me. The guy at the register was really helpful and recommended a pastry that I loved! I also got a salted caramel latte and it was so smooth and delicious I want to go get another one right now! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere alone would make me want to come back! It is beautiful inside and has a great patio. I ordered an iced raspberry mocha and a blueberry scone. Both were delicious!"}
{"text":"This Boss Coffee is a beautiful place. There is plenty of inside seating and a great outdoor seating area. They serve great coffee, have nice pastry, free wifi and friendly help.  The only negative is that they close at 5:00 pm.   You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"If coffee were beer, this would be it! Nice chill vibe inside, good baristas, nice munchies!"}
{"text":"Really great coffee.  I love that the store is a little quieter than some shops that play their music loud.  Great for business meetings."}
{"text":"I caught the \"Grand Opening\" sign in front of Boss Coffee as I headed north on Scottsdale Rd this morning.  I was with my family and one of my little ones had just announced that she had to go potty!  Perfect... I thought to myself as I so badly needed a cup of coffee.  I figured we'd stop at Starbucks at Pinnacle Peak but when I saw the sign for Boss, I directed my husband to turn into the newish shopping center so we could go there instead.    I was super impressed with Boss from the moment I stepped in the door.  Boss offers a welcoming environment with wifi, comfortable seating (inside and out), a pet-friendly patio, clean bathrooms, friendly staff, drive-thru, etc...  I for sure thought it had to be a chain that I hadn't heard of before as a result of all of the above + the look and feel of their signage, but I just looked it up and it seems to be local, at least for now!  I love that they have almond milk as there are plenty of coffee shops that don't. I had an americano with almond milk but later had order envy as I saw people drinking their signature iced brew.  I guess I'll have to return for that!    It appeared that there wasn't a ton of options on the food menu, but I didn't look too closely to be sure, so I'll have to return for that too.  Until then, if you find yourself in the area, definitely check out Boss; you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love the coffee and breakfast! Atmosphere is amazing. I enjoy coming here to work on my homework."}
{"text":"This place was love at first sight... I was told the \"cold brew\" is to die for...so of course I had to try it.....  As I walked in an adorable girl from behind the counter with sculptured to perfection eyebrows greeted me with a smile. I told her I was a newbie and wanted to try the cold brew. She gave me a sample from a draft bar ............and WoooooooW!!!!!!  This place is the sh@&!!!! The cold brew knocks your socks off and makes you wonder \"Why am I spending money at Starbucks\"........  There's also a lazy person drive thru....just up my alley. I would definitely go back to indulge in their pasty and a hot brew..."}
{"text":"The problems started at the register. It took over 4 minutes to order two coffees and two food items. I was asked if I wanted my pastry warmed and when I said \"no\" the guy immediately grabbed it from the case and put it in the oven. One of the coffees was made wrong, despite their \"make sure it's right on the screen\" ordering system. Latte was weak. My breakfast bowl was accurate, but the eggs were cut into...cubes? I've had better eggs at a Holiday Inn breakfast buffet. The \"homemade\" salsa was not worth pointing out it's their own. I came out of my way to get here, and I will not come back. Just go to Starbucks."}
{"text":"Treat yo self. Just when you thought your plain hot latte couldn't taste any better or be more expensive...here ya go! We are always greeted as we walk in. The baristas are polite and give excellent customer service. Clean and modern coffee shop with a nice bar set up with chargers for people who want to work from their lap top, phone, etc. Patio with plentiful seating and mountain views in the distance. Most importantly, their coffee is top-notch."}
{"text":"WOOOOW!!! I visited their drive-thru and ordered their Boxcar Cold Brew. Not only was their service excellent, but this is the first time I ever wanted to chug a cold brew!! Perfect amount of body in the roast, and the sweet cream was a great touch!!"}
{"text":"Specialize in brewed ice coffee. I sampled it and was terrific. I got a decaf Americano and it was nice. Friendly service nice place to relax."}
{"text":"What a wonderful addition to the area!!!   I have come in a couple times now and have tried a couple different drinks and they were all amazing.   The wonderful girl at the counter gave me such a warm welcome and made me the perfect latte!!  And she actually knew about coffee!!!!  Thank you for bringing the coffee culture to North Scottadale!!!"}
{"text":"Their mint black iced tea is amazingly refreshing. It's my new favorite. I can't wait to try more from here!"}
{"text":"Very solid americano made with Stumptown espresso. Knowledgeable staff and generous service."}
{"text":"The cold brew is the bomb.com!! I am in love!! I like it so much I bought a bottle. However when I set the bottle down in my car seat the lid opened up and I lost about 8 ounces of cold brew on my seat and floor. Pretty bummed about that other than that great experience. Great café to hang out in and chat and catch up with friends and great desert views that are amazing. Couple friends like the sandwiches too"}
{"text":"Great coffee place. Had the latte macchiato and its was amazing. Very cool place to sit back and relax inside or out on the patio. They also have charging stations for your iPhone."}
{"text":"What a relief to find a coffee bar that is off the beaten path and aesthetic to its surroundings. Dark natural woods with deep, rich textures as dark and Carmel-toned  as the brew and the lattes they serve.  My partner and I enjoyed a productive, yet relaxing morning plugged in yet outside on the patio at Boss Coffee.  Flavors are bold and aromatic not bitter or burnt. Reminded me of the Costa Rican coffee I enjoyed on my vacation. Their choice of beans? From Stumptown and  Water Avenue coffee Co.  A 5 star perfect cup to start the day! By far one of my favorite locations for coffee!"}
{"text":"Best coffee in Scottsdale hands down...  I live about 10-15 minutes away but worth the drive and great drive thru when I don't want to get out of the car in the morning.  The inside is awesome and it's got nice views on the patio.  Food is great too..."}
{"text":"Checked this place out yesterday. It's lovely! Such good ambience. Tons of window lighting with mountain views. Great chai tea latte. Nice seating. Loved it so much decided to come here again today with my husband because as a student, he's always looking for a chill place to study and I think this one is definitely a winner."}
{"text":"Boss Coffee makes a wonderful and flavorful Tahitian Vanilla Latte.  They make their own syrup and it just takes a little to make it very nicely flavorful without all the sugary sweetness.   So it's a treat.  Very cool and cozy atmosphere.  Lots of people stay to visit and have meetings or to work.  Great end spot in the strip with an outdoor area to sit next to the desert."}
{"text":"I'm into coffee- this shop serves Stumptown coffee so it's legit. Very cool upscale industrial vibe. Amazing prices for such premium coffee. My wife is into teas, so it was a win win. Sit outside, look at the mountains.... coffee heaven. Get the Cortada! Or try the nitro!"}
{"text":"Really good coffee and seating area. I love doing my work here because its quieter than most coffee shops."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, modern decor. Love sitting and enjoying a cup of coffee inside. Great to have something other than Starbucks."}
{"text":"Love this place! Very tasty coffee and friendly service.  The atmosphere in here is amazing too.  I ordered a latte with an extra shot, and took home a bottle of their Light Cold Brew.  The cold brew is definitely the way to go here.  It's very refreshing and energizing!  I think this place would be a great place to do some work as well and noticed they have lots of laptop plugs.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Is this place secretly a Starbucks in disguise? Or did a Starbucks used to occupy the space? I'm not sure but the drive-thru screamed Starbucks - the menu board, the electronic ordering box, the order window... The barista at the window was wearing a green apron and the straws are green. Even the logo on the cups are green! I thought about all of this as I ordered and sat waiting in my car for my drink. The wait wasn't very long but it was boring. No friendly greeting or social chit-chat. Just an impersonal exchange of money and latte. I ordered a small, hot, vanilla latte and it was nothing special. It actually tasted a little watered down. My husband had a few sips and said it was okay. Overall, I don't think I'll be back. There are several more local coffee shops in the area and they are much better than this. Don't waste your time on mediocre!"}
{"text":"Terrible, uncaring service. Took 30 minutes to get a coffee, a tea and a wrap -- stay away."}
{"text":"Good cold brew, good environment, but they have zero vegan options and do things like having tip jars comparing the best way to kill and cook animals. WHY. Not professional or classy at all. When it's slow it's great but if it gets busy the staff seem to get overwhelmed. The music is great (one of my favorite things at first!) but after coming here more than once I caught on to the fact it's the exact same playlist every single day."}
{"text":"Best I have been in the area and part of that is a real Large size cup. Most others have a medium or even small and call that Large. No way guys.  So here, we have a grill for breakfast sandwich choices. Cool setting in new and modern shopping area. Just right and demands a return."}
{"text":"Great espresso and coffee!  I'm somewhat of a coffee connoisseur.  I will travel 20 minutes for a great mocha.  Boss Coffee opened yesterday.  My aunt and I decided to try the drive-thru.  She had a Caramel Macchiato espresso and I had a Mocha with whip cream.  Both were actually the best coffee I have ever tasted.  The velvety smooth foam on top of the espresso is delightful and looks exactly like the picture on their website.  The espresso has a taste that could satisfy the most discriminative palate. The aroma of the coffee and the flavors remained on my mind throughout the day, seriously! Today, again I had my favorite Mocha, and my aunt tried a Mocha with caramel.  Again, fast service, wonderful flavors and texture.  My aunt said \"it's great, you get hooked on it right away\".  Thanks Boss Coffee for making espresso and coffee a real treat!"}
{"text":"A great addition in north Scottsdale. I'm tired of the chain coffee houses in this neighborhood, and this one is just the opposite of that. The ambience is hip, and the view to the McDowell Mountains is spectacular. Wonderful little patio area too. Love it! On top of that, the coffee is delicious and the staff is courteous& fast."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Fantastic service and professional workers, great place to study, and amazing coffee.  Can't ask for anything more!"}
{"text":"The coffee and cold brew were pretty amazing.  The price seems high - but they give you more coffee.  They start at 16 ounces so you pay for a medium, not a small. Quiet place.  They had both high-tops and lower tabletops.  The staff were nice.  They have some food and a drive thru.   Only bitch.  I'd change the logo away from Starbucks green.  That's it."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS COFFEE SHOP! Went in for the first time today and had a grear experience. The baristas were so friendly. There happened to not be a line as I was there at noon on a Monday so I got to talk to the baristas for a little bit as they got my order. The staff were super friendly and made me want to become a regular. Also, deal breaker, the coffee was great. I had a cold brew and it was strong but still smooth. Defintely coming back!"}
{"text":"I went through the drive-thru this morning and was highly disappointed. I ordered a 20 oz. Hot Mocha. I am not certain if it was the milk that was scalded so badly, or if it was the espresso/milk that gave the drink a terrible taste.  The representative that took our order was nice and to the point, didn't really open up any conversation while we were waiting, just kept the window shut until she needed to collect money or hand me the drink. I am fine with that, but have come accustomed to surrounding businesses that have open dialog as the drink is being made.  I gave it 2 stars because they didn't do anything that upset me, but the coffee was terrible. Both myself and a friend threw our drinks away directly after pulling out of the drive thru."}
{"text":"Sounds like everyone loves the cold brew, but I tried the salted Carmel latte both hot and cold and it was good. The atmosphere is what makes this place! It was a little toasty indoors but everything else was awesome! Knocked out some homework and enjoyed the views. A little on the pricey side but you can't beat a locally owned shop with quality product!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, knowledgable staff, superior product.  Our out of town guests were impressed.  The cold brew is smooth yet complex.  Plus - they have a choice of a lighter and darker choice.  Boom!"}
{"text":"This is a coffee shop, so my review is based primarily on the coffee and secondarily on the food.  This is top-notch coffee: robust, smooth, and flavorful.  Wifey had latte and I cappuccino.  Hers was artfully presented.  Both were abso-freakin'-lutely dee-lish.  Yowza!  A-plus!  Food was just as great.  Esposa had a croissant egg samich and I a farmhouse wrap.  I was expecting something light, wimpy, and dainty: wrong-o.  This was a big, burly man-rito chock full of yummy egg, avocado, cheese, ham and god-knows-what-else.  I couldn't get enough.  Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Love this new addition to North Scottsdale/Greyhawk area!! It's a boutique coffee shop with plenty of outside areas for sitting and very comfortable seating inside. Ideal location for a first date or business meeting. It's in the new shopping center with Sprouts. They allow you to sample the cold brew. Definitely do it!! All 3 are awesome. I love when I can enjoy cold brew without sweetener or cream, and this one passes the test. They also had a decent breakfast menu with meals of more substance than your typical muffin or pastry- but also offered yummy looking baked goods as well. I look forward to coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Great drive through coffee spot that is convenient with good coffee and tea options for people on the go. I've never taken time to run inside or use their patio, but people are always enjoying it when I drive through. They have a very unique and strong sweetened cold brew that i really enjoy, not like anyone other I've tried. Boss is definitely worth a try if you are in the area...SE corner of Pinnacle Peak and Scottsdale rd."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, public wifi, and lots space to spread out. It's a little off the beaten path, so don't recommend if you're in a rush. But if looking a place to chill, this is the place.  Came back Monday 2/28, ordered the oatmeal. It wasn't hot and tasted like paste. Bowl was nice but couldn't eat it. Can't understand how you can such a simple meal so wrong."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a fight on the way to get coffee. In order to make up, I agreed to go to the drive thru rather than go inside.   This was a total sacrifice on my part as I LOvE discovering the caffeine ambiance of places not named Starbucks.   So, I have nothing to say about ambiance   My latte was good. Smooth. Hot. Because of the fight, I forgot to say \"soy milk.\" I realized later that I had digested dairy. Luckily, there was no intestinal disruption as I may or may NOT be lactose intolerant.  I want to go back. I want to go inside!"}
{"text":"Everyone in my group commented that the coffee was really good (2 regular coffees, and a latte). Plenty of outdoor seating, but not a lot of shade, so we sat inside, but ended up leaving because we felt like we were too loud for the few people obviously studying and didn't want to bother them. I loved the atmosphere, but was a little dissapointed to not have been offered a real cup for my latte. Such a silly thing, but when it was delivered in a disposable cup, I did feel some disappointment. Hope to try cold brew next!"}
{"text":"Drinking something they call a cappuccino, but is just a foamy disaster served in a paper cup. I'm not even sure if there is espresso in there.  Vibe is nice and there is ample seating, but this drink is just gross."}
{"text":"Great location and ambiance. The staff is very friendly and it is definitely a nice place to enjoy a good cup of coffee. I tried their cold press and is was tasty. The espresso was good but not the best I have ever had. Free WiFi"}
{"text":"Short n sweet: I LOVED the decor and my cold brew was delicious, but man. Paying almost $6.00 for a 20 oz cup is highway robbery. And I GET it...a good product with quality ingredients isn't going to be cheap. But there has to be some sort of middle ground.   God knows I have no problem blowing money on work-week pick-me-up snacks and drinks. But even I can't swallow this one, even if it's with delicious cold brew. Sorry, Boss!"}
{"text":"Great place to pause for coffee on weekend mornings. Delicious lattes, quiet environment and plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Bring your pup and hangout on the patio"}
{"text":"Tried Boss Coffee for the first time. Ordered an ice coffee through the drive thru. Delicious coffee and the customer service was friendly. Will definitely be back. There coffee is so much better than Starbucks.  A++"}
{"text":"Stumbled in by accident after visiting the urgent care next door. I needed my coffee. I got it. YUMMY!"}
{"text":"There are few words to describe how awesome this place is. The decor is pretty fantastic, with a large amount of seating, tables and outlets inside, and a giant dog-friendly patio outside. But let's get down to talking about how great the coffee and service is, aight?   Happened to stumble upon this coffee shop while we were out and I could not be happier. Their espresso drinks are delicious, not bitter or too sweet like some other local coffee shops (yep calling you out here, Dutch). A friend of mine raves about the iced teas and smoothies. I personally am a huge fan of their cold brew which comes in three varieties. At first, you may be hesitant to try the French Roast, but trust me as a former barista at a place with green aprons that rhymes with MarsTucks, the French Roast here is a delicious full-bodied miracle elixir. It isn't too smoky or powerful. They also have a medium toast cold brew but one of the baristas told me they are reformulating it bc of the quality and strength of the beans they had been using. The final cold brew is their nitro French Roast. For those of you who don't know, this is when they infuse nitrogen into the cold brew giving it microbubbles with a nice effervescence and layer of foam. Super tasty. The female barista who was helping us gave us samples of each kind without us having asked. It was awesome!  No matter what you choose to drink, however, it is guaranteed to be delicious. The customer service is really stellar as well. I have been here twice, and have not been disappointed yet. There is usually a guy working who knows his shit. He is helpful, friendly, and genuinely interested in your thoughts on the drinks and the quality of the coffee. The ladies working also are stellar. I read in another review that someone working was \"short.\" I'm not entirely sure what that has to do with ability to recommend, make, and serve coffee, but it certainly hasn't affected any of the baristas here at Boss Coffee.   Trust me when I say you will not be sorry you came here...unless you got unexpectedly dumped at Boss Coffee, in which case I guess you may be sorry. But it's totally fine because you were better off without her anyway!   Drink Boss Coffee!!!"}
{"text":"Highly disappointed. Love everything else but then I got the acai bowl. They filled it all the way to the top so when I opened it in my car, because I did drive thru, it spilt all over me. Then they put it in a new bowl but everything started to get all mixed and they just dumped it in. So all the fruit and agave was on the bottom of the bowl. It's super soupy would be better as a shake then a bowl."}
{"text":"Great place for good food and coffee for a meeting or to work for a short bit. Friendly staff and atmosphere. They even have USB and power outlets."}
{"text":"So the pastries left something to be desired - dry, bland, boring, too sweet cheese Danish. I just got a hot English breakfast tea not the cold brew which seems to be this shop's specialty - the tea was lovely, which is important. The atmosphere was perfect for my purposes (schoolwork - research and writing) and the staff was so so friendly and exuberant calling hello the moment I opened the door. I'll come back again for the coffee and when I want a study spot but will continue searching for a good pastry spot.   Also seemed to get busier and tables with outlets filled up by the time I left around 10am. So if your computer needs a plug you may have to search around. Or go without."}
{"text":"Great place! Relaxing atmosphere, adorable decor, great staff, and delicious coffee. I come here for work or just to relax with friends. Give it a try there's a lot to choose from on the menu."}
{"text":"The employees that work here are fantastic! They are always so helpful and kind. My husband and I came here on Veterans Day and the lady at the counter gave us a discount because my husband served with the Coast Guard. It was very thoughtful. Their coffee is great. They serve Stumptown and I am partial to Stumptown because we moved here to Phoenix from Portland Oregon where Stumptown is from. My ONLY complaint (if you even want to call it that) is the music they play makes it feel like you are in a doctors office waiting room. I had hoped it was just a fluke but, unfortunately they play elevator music every time we have come in. The ONLY reason I am giving it 4 stars is because of the music they play. Other than that this pis an AWESOME place to come work and just relax with a nice cup of Joe! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I usually stop at Dutch Bros but decided to try Boss. It is a Thursday at 8:30am. I walked in because I drive a dually truck that is hard to get through a drive through. Took over 20 minutes to get a latte to go. I'll stick with Dutch."}
{"text":"We were so excited to see a new coffee place local that wasn't the normal chain. My husband and I went through the drive-thru after shopping at sprouts. However, they are very proud of their iced coffee. For 2 iced coffee's it was $12.. I still am a little shocked at how much we paid. Our service was good, but nothing out of the ordinary since the window was closed other than charging us or giving us our drinks. I'm all for supporting a small business, but not sure if I'll be going back there. Especially after getting home and measuring our cups.. We ordered 2 - 20 ounce iced coffees and we were given 16 ounce coffees. The whole drive home I was questioning the size so I decided to measure.."}
{"text":"Trendy, hip Coffee spot with fun, modern decor. More importantly, the coffee is very smooth and balanced - just like I prefer. Love the cold brew growler option! Similar price point to other shops in the area.   Next time I'll try one of their iced teas (one of my favs)."}
{"text":"Amazing spot for coffee. We stopped by Sunday afternoon for our first viist to hangout and have some coffee. It has much more space than the national chain across the street to the north. They also have cold brew on tap all day. Yay!  The decor is really cool as is the service! A big plus is that they have chargers for your electronics at just about every seat/table.   Oh yeah, the coffee was great too and they have a drive-thru if you're into that."}
{"text":"I decided I wanted to try someplace other than the usual suspects when it comes to coffee place so being a good yelper I scrolled through and came across Boss coffee. I tired the medium bodied house blend with just a couple pumps of the toffee nut syrup. This was a really good cup of coffee. I also had a croissant with butter. Just a nice quiet morning with good music in the background and a beautiful view of the mountains. Staff are friendly and helpful with coffee choices. I'm glad I came."}
{"text":"This place has the best coffee in Scottsdale. Love the atmosphere too. Baristas are always kind and helpful and the drive-thru is nice when you're in a hurry. Can't help but stop every time I drive past."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We hesitate to be really good reviews, for the selfish reason that we don't want it to get so busy that we don't have room to be there anymore, but the staff is fabulous, they have great coffee , fresh iced tea , and the acoustics of the place are very friendly and quiet. They have a great outdoor area and I can't wait for the weather to get cooler so we can use that as well."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior and even better coffee! By far my favorite coffee shop in Scottsdale! This place is very clean I was very impressed during my first visit and every visit there after. In love with their cold brew. It is far north in Scottsdale but definitely worth the drive. They have a drive through, but I absolutely recommend you park the car and enjoy your joe on the patio or inside enjoying the gorgeous interior. Give Boss coffee a try, you will fall in love!"}
{"text":"Beautiful environment, very nice and welcoming staff (Thank you Nicolas and Elizabeth), great espresso drinks. Cold brew on tap and bottles to take home along with you. The views from the patio are spectacular. The interior space is very cozy and comfortable. It is really nice to have Boss Coffee as a neighbor. They also have a drive thru. The prices are very reasonable. My latte was very tasty - there are two sizes to choose from 16 Oz and 20 Oz. There is also a nice selection of pastries and to go items such as sandwiches and salads to choose from."}
{"text":"Yessss finally found our neighborhood coffee shop!! The vibe is amazing from the inside to the out. It even has killer outside shaded seating over looking the mountains. The music is great chill out work music. And the coffee is on point and it's hard to impress me being born and raised in Seattle!! Thanks Boss coffee for opening up."}
{"text":"The smoothest coffee around and always consistant. Hot lattes served in a mug (upon request) remind us of our favorite Alterra Coffee (now Colectivo) along Milwaukee's Lake Shore :-). Great dessert setting, food & bakery too!"}
{"text":"Neat little place :) Nice and out of the way of city congestion and traffic but still a comfortable area. Everything is neat and orderly with a sort of industrial-rustic feel; a real relaxed environment that wasn't too busy even in the middle of the day on a Sunday. Coffee and pastries were delicious. I went in expecting to see a sandwich menu based on a photo of their menu someone took but was disappointed to discover they aren't offering breakfast or sandwich items at the moment, because they want to start making them in house instead of getting them from a vendor. So not a full cafe menu yet but it sounds like they're working toward that. To my discredit, I based my expectation on a Yelp photo instead of their website menu, so I'm not mad.  I thought it was nice they have charge cables set out for mobile devices as needed, but are organized in a way that's not obtrusive or sloppy. Free wifi obviously. I sat and worked at my laptop for several hours comfortably. Nice view. I will definitely want to come back when the summer heat is over and use the patio."}
{"text":"Nice view from the patio but this place is having some bumpy operational mishaps. I've never waited so long for a damn cup of coffee. Honestly it's sad. But, the staff is very honest and friendly and helpful, when things go awry they're like superheros chillin on the rooftop, waiting. Eyes endlessly peering into the abyss of time, waiting to serve an ice cold cup of justice, with a shot of chai."}
{"text":"Eh, it was ok. Food was mediocre, fast microwave food.  Coffee was good.  Service was less than good."}
{"text":"I've been going to Boss Coffee for a little for than 6 months, and it is by far my favorite coffee shop in the valley. The coffee and espresso are far superior to anything that Starbucks or Dutch Bros puts out, and the space itself has a very cool vibe. They have chargers for phones and tablets at most of the seats, and the wifi screams!  I'm typically there 4-5 days a week to study/work, and find it to be a very productive environment."}
{"text":"Smoothest cold brew that I've ever tasted!! They have a light and dark cold brew iced coffee, you've got to try both! I love the light, so delicious and refreshing. This coffee shop is my new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  The decor makes it seem like a brewery with growlers on the wall and a real casual atmosphere.  I ordered a large iced salted caramel latte and was happy with the way it came out.  Two things I REALLY loved about this place were built in phone chargers in the wall in case you forget yours.  The other thing is the associates hand deliver your drink(s) to you as opposed to just handing it over the counter.  Very personalized and think other shops should follow suit.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the price.  I paid over $7 for my one beverage."}
{"text":"Excellent staff, great quality food and drink. THE best place in North Scottsdale. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee shop! Although it's a little far out from my house, it's a super study spot. I found this place on Yelp and can't wait to go back. I got a dirty chai with almond milk and an apple cinnamon scone. The drink was phenomenal. :) Also, I love the high top table that faces the window. It had a great view and allows me to sit and stand, throughout my stay. The staff was very friendly. Productive vibes!!"}
{"text":"This is the best new coffee spot in N Scottsdale, possibly in the whole metro area. Nick very knowledgable in coffee and brewing science. The cold brew is not an ordinary ice over or boring brew, it is simply to die for, if you're a coffee enthusiast. Cold brew is made with love and with scientific wisdom that goes in to wine making. The atmosphere is perfect, contemporary and slick furniture and wall arts with the mountainous view. I am so happy they opened this within a mile of my house, I can stop by to work instead of Starbucks (). By far, the best coffee shop I've been to, next to the one I was once in Istanbul."}
{"text":"I like Starbucks but prefer to support local coffee joints if they can make decent coffee. I ordered my usual soy latte and my husband his dark roast drip coffee with no cream. We were both very disappointed, maybe it was because we had high hopes. My latte tasted too plain (almost watered down version of Starbucks cafe soy latte) and his coffee too weak. We sampled their cold brew coffee but it was nothing special and it was weak. We will be going back to Starbucks across the street until we can find another coffee spot."}
{"text":"Boss is one of our fave coffee shops in town! The ambience is super rustic yet contemporary, and very welcoming! We love the views of mountains outside with the dog friendly patio! The coffee is awesome and so are their creative combos! Try the maple scone (warmed) it's legit."}
{"text":"Great place and excellent coffee. My only disappointment was getting my coffee in a paper cup even though I asked for ceramic. No big deal, we all make mistakes. Give it a try"}
{"text":"Now that I've frequented Boss Coffee several times, I feel it's enough data for a review.  Much as is stated in other reviews, the place pretty much does it all right.  I'm partial to their hot mocha.  The inside is clean, and welcoming.  I do enjoy the decor, quite much.  The folks who work there are warm and friendly.  Every time I've been there, I've gotten consistently GOOD coffee.  Sitting here thinking, \"have I said anything bad about this place?\"  No, no I haven't.  While that makes it seem like the review was solicited.  It's not.  In fact, I'm going to go get a cup of coffee from them here just shortly.    Kudos to the staff and management as well.  You folks are doing all the right things, don't change it.  Revenge of the Nerds style high fives all round!"}
{"text":"Southeast corner of Scottsdale Rd and Pinnacle Peak, far south end of shopping center.  Drive through available, decent seating size inside for leisurely drinking, work, friendly conversations.  Good sized patio facing south, southeast.  Beans available from a couple different roasteries - all Oregon from the ones I examined.  Drip coffee available is medium or dark roast, but no posted info about origins.  Big focus on cold brew with beer-like draft tap handles, glass growlers, etc.  Generous parking.  A good alternative to Starbucks for a caffeine fix but not necessarily a coveted destination for the espresso or coffee snob."}
{"text":"just a nice relax chill place with top quality coffee and tea. Was a great hangout spot they did a great job on the place but there products and workers i give them a A plus! good stuff"}
{"text":"The nicest and finest coffee place I have ever been to in my life and I am a coffee aficionado ! If you're in the Scottsdale area you must come here for coffee it is fantastic and the decor inside is unparalleled to any place else don't even waste your time walking 2 minutes down the road to go to the Einstein Bagel joint when their reviews online are awful..."}
{"text":"This place is interesting as it's like a hybrid between an independent coffee shop and Starbucks. However brewing Stumptown coffee of course. It very relaxing. The food is nothing special. But is much better than most on the go places that you can stop at. It's definitely worth stopping in though if you are up in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"This is the first time we tried Boss coffee.  The establishment is well appointed inside and extremely clean. Service was very friendly and fast and our Americanos where brewed and delivered perfectly. They have outdoor seating but it was much too cold today to use the patio. Indoors they had very comfortable tables and chairs. We will definitely be back."}
