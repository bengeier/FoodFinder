{"text":"Love this place!!!  We eat here quite frequently, and have tried several different options on the menu.  So far, I haven't been disappointed.  Good food at a good price...what's not to like??"}
{"text":"Pretty good take out ...not bad one of the better options in the area..I personally like the sesame chicken and there sa cha beef ...also the kung pao"}
{"text":"Started out with one of the longest waits I've experienced for something as simple as bourbon chicken. One of the appeals of Chinese food is the quickness with which the order is normally completed. This wasn't the case here. For the lunch special being only 5.95 (including a drink) it could be a good deal - but only if your time isn't valuable. For me, waiting in excess of 20 minutes and still not having the food yet is a bit much.

The food was about as good as you'd expect an unimpressive Chinese food place to be. If you've never had truly good Chinese food an are used to a mall food court, it will probably taste acceptable.

5.95 for a drink, two semi-okay crab Rangoon and a dish is the draw."}
{"text":"Went to this place only cause my favorite place was closed. So i ordered 3 lunch meals they came with drinks. It's like they dont want to give you drinks cause had to ask for my cups. The guy handed me one. With a hand gesture says to get the rest my self. I asked for a chilie sauce they wanted to charge me a $1 . I'm like dude I just bought 3 meals . Then I ask for a drink carrier, hand my hand out in stead of handing it to me puts on the counter. This place sucks. Bad people skills.  Never again will I give them any business. Screw you china east.  I hope you lose your buisness!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese food! I would definitely go back! Courteous service! Gods prices. Food was ready in 20 min. Alright with me!"}
{"text":"One of the better ones I found in a while. Almost everything is very great, everything is just good. We order extra to take home and warn up for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Food was ok, nothing exciting. Typical menu. The inside was not that clean, and no fountain drinks. Water or tea or cans. If no other option, I may consider take out, but last resort. Walls were unclean and had typical \"restaurant film\" on tables, floor etc."}
{"text":"Since I moved in Fort Mill I've been looking for something to replace my old favorite local hole in the wall China II near Tega Cay...This place seems to be a similar menu (maybe a franchise), but not all the dishes are exactly the same.  I liked the fried rice & dumplings better at China II, but the Kung Pao and Crab rangoon better at China East.  I am a bit torn at which is better but I think it is China II by a nose because the dumplings at China East are inferior by far.  On the positive China East has the best Kung Pao I've had anywhere in the area (still not as perfect, but the closest I've had to perfect for sure).  Another complaint I have with them is that some of their dishes go REALLY skimpy on the meat, while others are fine.  I wanted to rate it one star less than China II, but I had to bump them on par just because of the Kung Pao.  Overall I like this place and will be ordering my Chinese takeout from here most of the time.

Also as someone else mentioned....stay away from the bourbon chicken.  It is my least favorite of that dish that I've tried anywhere."}
{"text":"1st time in and went well. Typical Chinese take out. The service was good. The place was clean. Had to use the bathroom and it too was clean. The food was good. The price is very reasonable. Plenty of parking. What more can one ask for. We will return again."}
