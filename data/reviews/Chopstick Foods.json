{"text":"This place is a rip off. On a $8 I gave her $20 she only wanted to give me back $10 and the food was gross"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years! The food is always really good and tastes the same each time so you always know what to expect. Cantonese chow mein is my absolute favourite, the chicken soo gui is also really delicious! Prices are good, food is ready fast, and when you get delivery it generally doesn't take longer then 20 minutes (unless it's a holiday such as New Year's Eve) 

Staff is always friendly when you cal ahead to place an order for takeout."}
{"text":"A standard hole-in-the-wall takeout place, with the usual dishes, but they are very, very well-executed and reasonably priced. All of the dishes are fresh and hot, crisp where they should be and very flavourful.  The Shanghai noodles have a real spicy kick, and the crispy ginger chicken is addictive - I caught myself standing over the dish just eating them with my fingers. Portions are very large for under $10. Order lots and enjoy the flavours again the next day or two.

Quick and friendly delivery is free on orders over $20."}
{"text":"Wings taste a bit spoiled... or very close too it... on more then one visit. They put too much sauce on all the dishes I've order... not a fun time.. I've tried them 3 times an was disappointed every time... thing is I'm not that picky"}
