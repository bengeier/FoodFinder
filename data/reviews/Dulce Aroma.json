{"text":"I wanted a bakery near my home. A place that makes authentic deserts from scratch. I found better!!  I saw a sign in a window of 'boring' shops of the past 'bakery opening soon', my heart was filled with anticipation.   Dulce Aroma Bake Shop is run by the kindest of people from Uruguay, who pride themselves on their makes.   From traditional cookies to homemade stuffed turkey breast, this place is great for a quick meal or coffee and dessert with friends.   You've got to check this place off your list of great food destinations. Subtle sweetness and aromatic flavours, you'll be sure to visit many times a week.   Thank you for being close to my home and my heart!!!  Paul D"}
{"text":"This place is a true gem hidden at the side of a strip mall at Lawrence and Black Creek. Three individuals from the same family run this little Uruguayan establishment. Husband Gustavo is a trained chef, wife Alexandra is a food lover who can bake anything outrageously delicious to perfection, and the quiet and reserved friendly sister-in-law Analea who can make any desert the utmost dream.  I have never tasted such good food for a long time in this city (leaving me to manage my own humble cooking skills for lack of better alternatives). They continually make new dishes and deserts daily and will also make anything to order. There is little space to eat in but it can be done. It is mostly a take -out venue. All ingredients are the finest quality. The only downfall to their success will be their slightly obscure location which can be overcome once they are known to more customers. The prices are more than affordable and the coffee and hot chocolate are delicious, especially with a cinnamon bun, or any other breakfast treat available at that time. Dulce Aroma is open at 7AM to 7PM except Saturday & Sunday when they close at 3PM  (closed on Mondays). I wish I could keep this place as my own little secret but I don't want them to go out of business."}
{"text":"A local bakery that recently just opened. I tried various of things there, such as their croissants (DELICIOUS!), and pastries. There were those race balls with cheese in it, I thought it okay and same goes for those pastries that had spinach in them (sorry I don't know the name of it)  They had little seats by the window which I liked and the decorations were well put together!"}
