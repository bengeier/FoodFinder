{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with my kids and in-laws before going on the train. Everything was delicious. We shared onion rings, the kids had chicken fingers and pancakes. I had the turkey soup which was excellent and my wife had the chicken souvlaki wrap. All very yummy with generous portions. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place I've ever been to! Our family goes there for holidays, (Mother's Day, Birthdays) and the staff are super polite. Really family oriented with large tables and colouring pages for kids."}
{"text":"Honestly, it's the best breakfast place in all of Ontario! The food is classic with big portions to fill you up for the day!!   I had the chicken Caesar salad (delicious!) My dad had the LA clubhouse  My mom had the Philly  My brother had the chicken quesadilla  And we all shared our food and it tasted fantastical. The service was superb, giving us coffee when we don't ask.  Totally recommend the onion rings, chicken quesadilla, (perfectly grilled), any of the salads and definitely more coffee!"}
{"text":"Cash only, which they don't advertise till the moment they bring the bill. However they charge HST and in my case server wasn't friendly and didn't even pretend being grateful for extra tip. Slow service, cheap decor, food is ok but nothing special for the prices above average. Don't recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Great place, great food, great staff! Stop in here if you live in town or just driving through.  The chicken Cesar wrap is awesome. The best onion rings around too! The breakfast is so yummy too!"}
{"text":"Classic breakfast and lunch place. Full menu, great service. I usually have a regular bacon and egg breakfast or a custom ordered omelette. Bottomless coffee as well. They have a great kids menu and daily specials. They've begun opening for dinner (not every evening, check hours). It's pretty much the local breakfast hangout. It gets really busy on weekend mornings. If you're coming for the train, you'll have a great meal here before or after.   Here is my reason for not giving it 5 stars:  - Cash Only. ATM on premises. I get why businesses want cash, but a lot of people don't use cash very much anymore. By going cash only, you're just inconveniencing your customers. Then foisting an ATM with an excessive fee is even worse. I don't understand why a business wants to make it hard for people to give them their money. They need to also consider the awkward position they are putting the service staff in. Instead, why not incentivize using cash by offering a 2% discount (or whatever your credit card fees are, that are trying to be avoided) for cash transactions."}
{"text":"Just moved into town and must say the best place to have breakfast and lunch with family. Menu had manny good selections and the service was great! Looking forward to come back for lunch:)"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and have had a good experience each time. The food is great, the service is pretty good... I think the prices are the reason I'm taking a full star off. Breakfast is roughly $12 a plate and with more people than yourself it adds up too quickly."}
{"text":"The CK burger is easily one of the best burgers I've had in a while. Real homemade texture and taste with a nice soft (but not too soft) bun.   Was going to have the Eggs Benedict but might try that next time if I can resist the temptation to order the CK burger again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little breakfast joint. Lunch/dinner menu looks pretty good too so we'll definitely be back. My wife and I went on a Saturday morning expecting it to be busy after reading some positive Yelp reviews. It's bigger than we expected so lots of places to sit, and our food probably took no more than 10 minutes. Coffee is pretty good for a diner. Staff were very attentive and kept things running smoothly without having to ask for anything.  NOTE: Cash only with an ATM on site. $0.75 fee for withdrawal."}
{"text":"Waited 20 mins before our order was taken. Then another hour+ for our food to arrive. They took and processed orders for take out before ours and kept pushing back our orders. When I followed up with the waitress, she gave me attitude as if I should understand that they were busy. Waiting over an hour for eggs and bacon is not worth it. Food was plain and nothing special"}
