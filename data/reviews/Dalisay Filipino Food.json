{"text":"Water on the floor and not being swept. They ask for your order and forget about it.. They look at you and ask again, then still not prepare it. Let u pay.. Then another person stares at u and asks you what u want again! Food is ok.. But pricey for the quality and location. No presentation at all"}
{"text":"I gave this place 1 star because 0 was not an option. Horrible service, dirty, and terrible food. I found a bug in my food and the staff didn't see any problem. They acted as if I was lucky to receive a free protein. STAY AWAY! You're better off eating from the dumpster out back."}
{"text":"Tucked between a much larger Chinese restaurant and a FreshCo grocery store is this little flilipino food joint. With it's simple black and white sign and mirrored door glass, you'd be forgiven if you passed by this place all the time and either didn't notice it or assumed it was a hair salon.

The setup is simple. Order your food at the counter. It's cafeteria style. There are a handful of hot dishes to choose from, warmed in the bain-marie (or hot table as the non-Quebecois might say). I'm no expert in filipino food but I was hoping for some dishes like sisig. They did have kare-kare (beef in peanut sauce) although the beef was not super tender. 

Lots of seating and filipino dramas and news on the TVs. Staff is friendly and does not get nonplussed (yes I'm using that word correctly http://www.thefreedictionary.com/nonplussed) by two arm flapping honkeys who are probably hoping this is just a Jollibee.

Prices are reasonable. $7 for the 2 item combo (comes with rice and bottled water). Although small, they take Visa/Mastercard/Debit."}
{"text":"I am pretty new to Filipino food. 
Since I live in the area, I thought that I should try this place out. The first time I came here, I asked for a take out menu, but the servers told me with a confused look that they do not have one, despite their signage saying that they do takeout service. So I left and didn't try them until I recently decided to dine in. To my surprise, I found out that Dalisay isn't like a dine in restaurant where you order from a menu with your server and pay tip. You actually order at the front counter as if it was a cafeteria. Nice since I don't enjoy paying tip (I'm a student).

I ordered one of the combos, which includes 1 bowl of rice, 2 bowls of side dishes and a complimentary bowl of sour soup. I chose Kare Kare and Chicken Adobo. It was 7.99 I think. Since I'm more used to getting a large portions of food from chinese restaurants, overall I think it's quite pricey for what you get in the combo...especially since everything is conveniently served on those buffet tray warmers. And it sort of looked like the food in the warmers were sitting there for a while.

The bowls of side dishes were not really full of meat. The Chicken Adobo was 75% bone, hardly any meat in there which was disappointing. The karekare was pretty much peanut sauce, with sparingly pieces of beef. The dishes seemed really over seasoned (salty)... and the sour soup was unbearably sour. I mean I've had sour soup before... but this tasted like I was sipping vinegar. 

For dessert I ordered Halo Halo (the bigger sized one), which was pretty tasty but also small for the price paid ($5.50 I believe). I actually like the corn flakes on top, it's a nice bit of texture.

These seem like downtown prices in an uptown area. I will say that the staff were very pleasant and nice to talk to though."}
{"text":"I saw the word Filipino Food and all I thought about is Halo Halo!! 

I wish restaurant would have a sample menu on display at their storefront. While I trying to peek through the mirrored door glass, I couldn't tell if there were people and if they have Halo Halo. Then one man trying to get in telling me that Dalisay serves Filipino Food... duh?! 

The menu is right behind the nice man then I saw Halo Halo for $4.99... I ordered that after I was reassured that ube ice cream was available. It took quite a long time for my dessert to arrive... $3.99 I paid now... so am I getting a discount or what? 

It was a funny version of Halo Halo as breakfast cereal was used instead of crushed rice... maybe this one is the Canadian version or is this a breakfast version?... I wish for more ice cream... I wish for more substance... 

The nice man asked me how was it... I told him I want more ice cream... then he told me that there is a $5.99 version? I left a little confused...."}
