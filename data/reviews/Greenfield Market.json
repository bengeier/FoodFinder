{"text":"Great selection, fair prices, DELICIOUS homemade kimchi. The storekeeper is very attentive and sweet, she said even the fish sauce in the kimchi is homemade by her with her family's recipe.   I'm a tad distressed about the review below mentioning a rat sighting. I hope this grocer has gotten an exterminator since 2014 (date of the review). It definitely seemed very clean and tidy!  Will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Rat!!!!!!!! Ewwww!!! I went last night but they were closed...thank goodness because there was a huge rat inside. I posted a pic I took, it's on the bag of rice in the corner:("}
{"text":"This place has a great selection of bulk goods and packaged health foods, but the real winner is the kimchi. The kimchi is locally made, wonderful quality and fairly priced."}
{"text":"Great korean organic store in the parkdale neighborhood :) I got the kimchi from here and it was delicious.. def coming back when I finish mine.."}
