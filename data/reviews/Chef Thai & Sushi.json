{"text":"A great Yelp find, Chef Thai is a win! The menu is great and, as everyone has noted, the ingredients are wonderfully fresh. Very tasty stuff. And, they didn't flinch at bringing the kids one order of sesame chicken with two plates (that they still didn't finish). 

Delicious food, fantastic service, great value. Thanks Yelpers!"}
{"text":"I went by there last week to get some takeout. However, they seem to have closed permanently. A Vietnamese restaurant is opening in its old location. This is a shame because I thought the food was very good."}
{"text":"The Thai basil with chicken was a total win! Hot and sour soup delicious. The spring rolls tasted fresh and the dumplings were awesome as well. Crab Rangoon (I forgot the actual name) was a huge let down. The decor was nice and intimate."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi made just how I asked.  The fried rice was a little different from what I'm used to, but now it's the only kind I want."}
{"text":"I am absolutely floored at finding a gem tucked away in a run down shopping center in Concord, NC.  My husband and I stopped in because we have friends who said they ate there once and liked it - and we were in the mood for  Thai and an adventure.

There wasn't a soul inside the restaurant when we arrived.  It made us extremely nervous.   We both decided to go \"safe\" just in case it was all bad.

We were dead wrong.

The food was incredible.    My green curry was full of fresh, delicious vegetables and fresh basil.  Delicious.  Flavorful.   Fresh.  Yes I keep saying fresh.  I can't stress enough how full of never-frozen vegetables my curry was.  They're not skimping here.  I ordered mine medium spicy and it was pretty spicy.  Not too much but I'm very glad I didn't go for hot.

My husband's Pad Thai was similar.  He was just as pleasantly surprised by the non-greasy, flavorful plate he got.  He ordered his as \"hot\" and said it was pretty hot.

The owner of the restaurant chatted with us for a bit and is very enthusiastic about his recipes and foods.  

We are already planning to go back in the next day or two and probably again for lunch later this week.

Quit going to the greasy \"Chinese\" takeouts that clutter our landscape and go here for a real meal!"}
{"text":"All the Thai dishes here are so authentic and fresh.  It's the kind of food that you look forward to having for leftovers.   The curry dishes are my favorite.  Be sure to adjust your spice preference,  the lowest level  is as spicy as I can take.  The green curry is the milder choice but still delicious.  I would have given them 5 stars, but the sushi  I've had from here is not that great.  But it could have been a poor roll choice too."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!!! Hidden back in a strip mall so don't miss it. Go once and you'll be hooked. Best Thai food hands down in Charlotte/Concord area."}
{"text":"The food here is phenomenal. I had the sweet and sour soup, spring roll and Cashew Nut chicken on my 1st visit and have been going back since. 

Will have to say this is a small operation so do not expect things to happen fast. We have had the same mild, mannered waitress every time. 

The decor is appropriate. The benches are a little uncomfortable and would suggest a chair."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars, because the food is very very good. BUT the portion sizes are not good, at least when you get a takeout order.

I ordered the green curry with extra mixed vegetables added (+$2.00). There were not extra vegetables added to my order at all. The portion size was extremely small and they didn't even fill the container up all the way, it was only half way full. Usually, thai curry takeouts are put in those taller plastic soup containers. I was really disappointed and I don't live near Concord so it's not like I could go and complain about it.

As far as the taste, the spiciness was great and was a nice infusion with the green curry. The eggplant was very good, I just wish there had been more! This was definitely not worth $12.

This is a great place for flavorful thai food, just don't expect to get much! Oh, and I got a side of red pepper oil and it was in the TINIEST container and was only about 1/3 of the way full!!! Why even give it away if you're not even going to fill it up?"}
{"text":"This restaurant has changed ownership a few times over the last few years, and I have tried them all. Chef Thai is the place to go to if you want some great food. The food is amazing, and the staff is very friendly. They have some of the best Green Curry I've ever had."}
{"text":"The food here is always excellent, and the service is friendly. The restaurant serves a wide variety of food and sushi. The appetizers, larb, noodle dishes and curries are delicious. Takeout is available. The dining room is fairly quiet and comfortable."}
{"text":"The Sushi Bomb is the bomb!  Try it with the ginger and soy sauce.  I usually order takeout from there and it's only a 15 minute wait. Great variety and decent prices."}
{"text":"I am SO GLAD i found this GEM of a place in the Kannapolis / Concord area!! I almost always get the chicken pad thai (medium spicy) and have NEVER been disappointed!! SO FLAVORFUL!! And when you go before 3pm - dine in only - the pad thai dish comes with a hot and sour soup and a mini spring roll with a sweet sauce to dip it in...kinda like duck sauce but better. (Not sure if any other dishes come with these 2 appetizers since i mainly stick to the pad thai). Well worth the price! On occasion, if i happen to go after 3pm, i make sure to order as an appetizer the chef roll (it's pictured under the glass tabletop at every booth). Delicious!! You must do yourself a favor and try this spot at least once. I'm sure you WILL be back again!"}
{"text":"It definitely is our go-to place in Concord for Thai cuisine. It hasn't disappointed us yet. Totally recommend."}
{"text":"Ok, so I didn't order any \"thai\" food so I can't comment of that aspect but I did order won ton soup, fried rice, and a crunch roll and waited 45 mins!!! This was a pretty simple order and the food was bland but I still can't get over that I waited 45 mins!!! There were only 3 occupied tables so I am not sure what the problem was but I would not go back."}
{"text":"Today is the second time I've been here. The man that greets and sits everyone is amazing and also the brother of the owner of the restaurant. The place is family owned by a family from Thailand and they have only been opened for 5 months. I haven't tried their sushi but their Thai dishes are really good.

The first time we came here for dinner, it was a Friday night and the place was pretty empty. We ordered Pineapple fried rice, Red curry (spicy level: hot), and the Thai sweet and sour. We did not expect such good authentic Thai food in the Concord area!

Today I stopped by for takeout and got the Thai Basil (spicy level: hot). I'm impressed again and I can't wait to try the rest of their dishes and sushi."}
{"text":"We originally sought out this place when visiting friends in the Concord area a year ago and were delighted to find an authentic Thai restaurant in NC after so many disappointing experiences in other parts of the state where 80% of the \"Thai restaurants\" are more Chinese than Thai.  We recently returned with the same friends and once again found the Thai dishes have not wavered from the true Thai flavors.  My only complaint is that some of the dishes tended to be a little too sweet for my taste. Highly recommended are the pad thai, veggie delight, and seafood tom yum."}
{"text":"This place is a very good restaurant for great Chinese or Thai food. They have various good noodle, chicken, and curry dishes. The interior isn't great but it's still a nice atmosphere to enjoy a meal. I usually get take out from here for this reason. Take out is usually quick and they always seem to get the order right. I digress, the food is amazing here. They have very good noodles and their blends of flavors are amazing!"}
{"text":"Our absolute favorite Thai restaurant! We love the staff. They are always so friendly. They remember us when we come back. It is nicely designed and feels upscale. The food is the best evvvvvvvver We usually get spring rolls, cashew chicken and sweet and sour chicken. Hubby loves the California roll sushi also. Food is always presented beautifully. Even the drinking straws paper are fashioned into beautiful  flowers. Don't miss out on this place."}
{"text":"Where is everybody?  This place is the deal!  Order the duck pad Thai!  You are welcome!"}
{"text":"Sushi was so so but the Thai food was amazing. Thai food is definitely their main focus. I haven't had this good Thai food since I moved here. Drunken noodle and Pad See U were delicious. I intend to return."}
{"text":"Love going to off the beaten path restaurants, and this one is a GEM! Had the Drunken Noodles with Chicken, DELICIOUS! Just the right amount of spiciness and the home made flat noodles were gorgeous. You must try this place."}
{"text":"This place is great! Fast service, awesome food.  Can't speak of the busy times because we went a little later than normal lunch hour, so it wasn't busy at all, but we received great service. The bathroom (ladies') was clean and smelled nice which is always a plus.  We don't live in that area, but next time we're there, we'll definitely visit this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Great Thai food!  The wait for it to come out of the kitchen was just too long - 45 mins."}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant around.  Coming from Florida where Thai food was very easy to come by, it was hard for me to try this place because it's the only one in town thst I know of. Good thing I did. Great place to have a date night! Their curry is delicious!!! It's almost better than the place I frequented in Florida! I love this place. A must go!"}
{"text":"This is our second time coming here.  The first time I came I had miso soup and lad mar and it was delicious! My boyfriend had the drunken noodles both times and he loved it!  This place is on the same level as Basil downtown Charlotte, but half the price! The second time I had the sassy girl sushi roll and the miso soup.  The sushi was really fresh and tasty!  The miso soup is some of the best I have had."}
{"text":"This place is amazing; everything from the service to the food! A hidden gem that I stumbled upon thanks to a Groupon a few months back. Everything I've ordered has been delicious from sushi to entree. Must try rolls are the Beauty and the Beast roll and the Sunset roll. Favorite entrees are the Drunken noodles, Pad Thai and the pineapple fried rice and those are just the ones I've tried this far. You can't go wrong with this place, it's truly the best Thai I've ever had! Thank me later."}
{"text":"Wow! I was going to say, best sushi ever...Until they refused to accept my AMEX. Great sushi, but the refusal if my company Amex was poor form. Sushi was the best ever!!!"}
{"text":"This spot is pretty nice inside. It's clean and well kept. I saw some people dressed rather nice and others in jeans and a tshirt so pretty diverse group. The waitress was really friendly and chatted with us whenever she had time. She was helpful with selecting our food as well. The food was right around average Thai food. It's not bad but it's also nothing special. I wouldn't mind going back here if I'm around again."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant, the decorations is beautiful , the food delicious and presentation have a 100% , the server was awesome even that she was by herself. I highly recommend it and we definitely gonna comeback!"}
{"text":"This is seriously, the best red curry I've ever eaten. Ordered it \"Thai hot\". It's hot and flavorful.  Got it to-go so I can't comment on the service but the man who helped me was super nice. I have a new go-to lunch spot."}
{"text":"Yesterday we went to Chef Thai for lunch. 

We ordered:  spring rolls, (yum!), egg soup (yum!), the beef and cucumber salad, chicken green curry, pork drunken noodles, ginger shrimp and the crispy duck!

Everything was wonderful but the prize goes to the crispy duck!!!  DELICIOUS!!!!!"}
{"text":"Sort of a random location, but found this because of Yelp! I had a spicy tuna roll and massaman curry with chicken. Something told me not to get sushi in NC, but I went for it. It was bordering on fishy, but not bad enough for me to leave it uneaten. The curry was flavorful and had just the right amount of spice. Tender chicken and lots of peanuts! Overall it was a great meal in an unexpected location!"}
{"text":"This place has really good food! It's cool to see a restaurant have different Asian cuisines and make it delicious. The prices were very good compared to other Thai restaurants and the quality of the food is great. The people were super friendly, but the service was kind of slow (maybe because we came later at night)."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with their food. I'm a big fan of thai food. We got the drunken noodle, the thai basil fried rice, chicken wings and a seafood with ginger stir fry. We were happy with all the dishes ordered and portions were plentiful. Best of all they had my favorite dessert---- mango with sticky rice and coconut milk!!!! The mango was ripe and sweet and the rice was nice and sticky. I was very happy at the end of the meal and busting at the seams!!!"}
{"text":"Great food!  1st time eating Thai. Ordered Pad Thai chicken spicy.  We'll be back again"}
{"text":"The place was empty when I made my order. It was empty when I came back 15 minutes later to pick it up. The girl at the counter was nice enough, on her phone when I walked in but quickly put it away as I approached. I ordered drunken noodles and sesame chicken. Both were really good. A little better than average but not the best I've ever had. The price wasn't to bad so I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"The Thai Basil beef was delicious (I asked them to chop the beef and they kindly accommodated my request). The fried egg roll was tasty, they were pre-sliced). The tom yum soup was a little sweet for my taste. Overall, a very good experience, the staff was very nice."}
{"text":"Surprised to find this spot just down the road from work, been twice in 2 weeks and looks like it will be a regular stop now.The drunken noodles are addicting as well as the Panang curry.  Have not ventured int the Sushi realm yet, my feeling on that is:  
A. This is a Thai restaurant first and foremost
B. If I want Sushi I am not getting it from a Thai place

I love the Thai Tea, it must have a 1000 calories alone but its worth the caloric investment."}
{"text":"A bit let down after reading such great reviews. Pad Thai was very bland and generic, sushi was sub par. The tempura shrimp looked more like deep fried chicken."}
{"text":"Best Tom Ka soup in Concord!  Authentic and very very good Thai.  We come here several times a month and have never been disappointed.   They have a great selection of sushi as well.   It's never crowded and always tasty.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Always a great place to eat at. They have great food and the staff is always very friendly. This is truly  one of the hidden gems of the Concord/Kannapolis area"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Much better Thai food than you will find in Charlotte.  Great lunch specials.  Sam P."}
{"text":"Thanks Yelpers!  Found this while visiting the area, what a gem.  Greeted by friendly face and the excellent service carried throughout the meal.  They brought complimentary spring rolls and soup.  The soup was very tasty.  

We had very fresh sashimi, pad Thai and drunken noodles.  Chicken was better than the shrimp.  We ordered it  3 out of 5 spicy and it def had a kick.

Reasonable prices too.  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"The Beef Ginger Delight was amazing as well as the Hurricane roll. Service was impeccable and refills on drinks were speedy. We would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Love the food here and excellent service. Chef is super accommodating about any dietary issues. Don't let the strip mall fool you, this place is tops!"}
{"text":"My family wanted some Thai food and decided to check this place out since many people on yelp raved about the food. We came here in a big group with dogs and the restaurant was very accommodating. Chef Thai offers both sushi and Thai food but we only ordered the Thai dishes from the lunch menu. All the lunch entrees came with a spring roll and hot and sour soup, and they were reasonably priced.

The red curry was good but I was not a big fan of the massaman curry. The server didn't ask for the spicy level of the dishes, but the curries didn't turn out too spicy. The vegetables were a little crispy and undercooked for my liking. The stir fried noodles were great, but I couldn't taste the difference between the pad see ew and pad see mao. The service was quick since we were the only table. Overall, I think the experience and food were good but not amazing."}
{"text":"Just average. Nothing special about this place. There are much better Thai places in charlotte area. The day we went it was about 80 degrees in there and the waitress told us the air was broke and there was an issue between the owners and landlord so they can't get it fixed. Too bad. Prob won't be back"}
{"text":"Probably the best Chicken Pad Thai I've had recently. It's served with a lime wedge which really sets off the flavor. Also I got 3 star and I like hot things and it was some solid heat. I don't think I could have handled  4 or 5 star heat. If you love hot Thai food this is your place. If you aren't a spicy food person stick with 1 or 2 star. The sushi was pretty well priced and tasted good. It wasn't the best I've had but still good quality for the price."}
{"text":"Was in town for work and just looking for somewhere close to eat. It was close, but also amazing!  The staff was super friendly, fair prices and the food came out extremely quick. Definitely going back if I'm ever in town again. A shame this place isn't packed with the quality of food they produce"}
{"text":"This place has delicious Pho.  The people are very friendly, and always accommodating.  They have fresh ingredients, and always get the order correct.  Delicious."}
{"text":"I really love their green curry! Mine was a bit spicy but you can definitely adjust it. I tried their pad Thai, and sushi too- they were good. But their curry is by far my fav! Give this place a try!! (:"}
{"text":"I can't believe this restaurant! It's a little out of the way restaurant that has the best Thai food in all of the Charlotte metro region.  The food is always fresh and I have not had one bad meal in the 8 to 10 times and I've eaten there in the last four months.  Both the entrées and sushi are excellent. They combine excellent food at very reasonable price. Both your pallet and your pocketbook will be happy. Now if you're looking for a fancy place this is not your restaurant but if you're looking for great Thai food I can't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I figured I would try this spot since it's in concord.  I carried out for lunch special. I think the portion was a little small and the spring roll could have been better. The red curry chicken was Excellent."}
{"text":"I've been to Chef Thai a few times now and I have had a few different experiences there. Mostly I have gotten good service from all the staff there. The food is pretty good and very decently priced. Though one time I went and was completely ignored. We waited at least 15 minutes for someone to come take our drink order and so we just ordered our food at the same time just in case we would have to wait that long again. We had ordered an appetizer and never recieved it or any other food after 20 more minutes of waiting. We ended up just leaving after this. We couldn't stand watching other tables that came in after us recieve food while we were stuck there waiting. Overall I think I will go back again but hopefully with a little better service next time."}
{"text":"Very good Thai food.  Enjoyed their Tom Kha Gai soup and cashew chicken.  Good spring rolls.  Decent atmosphere and good service.  We are in town visiting family and there are are not a lot of restaurants other than chains.  We will eat there again."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate here a few months ago. It was a great experience, spending nearly $100 on a few appetizer and entrees. I have pictures posted on Facebook but I am just going to cut to the chase, it was definitely worth trying and I would recommend it. You can't set a budget on good food. LOL. Their papaya is awesome with flavorful taste, although the price is a bit higher than I normally pay for in other places. Great red snapper to try out but range is around $30. Sushi was very good, sadly I only got to try one roll so I will surely go back for it. If only it was cheaper and closer to where I live."}
{"text":"Had the Crunchy Sushi Roll. Very tasty. For dinner had the pad Thai and mussamun curry. These were presented well and was some of the best I've ever had. We were very delighted since this was our first time here and we will be back."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here after work because it is quite, friendly and the Sushi and food is good.  It is never crowded - which I like.  I am usually finishing up some sort of office work and need a change of environment."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurants I have ever been to. The sushi here is also severely underrated. This place is a hidden gem"}
{"text":"Great little Thai place in Concord.  I will definitely be going back.  The spring rolls and veggie delight sushi were very good.  I would get the spring rolls every time I go!!!!  

If you have to have sushi with shrimp sauce, they do not have it.  My friend love shrimp sauce on her sushi.  As for me, I like ginger and soy sauce.  They do add a little spicy mayo sauce on top of sushi.  

Not sure about their more traditional Thai dishes but next time I go back I will be probably get one.  Looking at other's plates while passing by, they looked good."}
{"text":"I use to love this place! I would always get pad Thai with a side of spring rolls. Their peanut sauce is so yummy. I usually try to go on lunch because they have a lunch special from 11-3 for 7.95 but the past 4 times I've been there I've had the same waitress who rushes me to order and tries to walk off before I'm finished ordering. I do not care for bean sprouts at all so I let her know please no bean sprouts but she never writes anything down so it always comes out wrong. She didn't check on me once and after sitting for 45 minuets done with my meal I just left money (which I usually never have I try to only carry my debit card) on the table and left. Will not be back. Good food does not excuse terrible service!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Thai in Concord, hidden gem for sure! Always consistent, service is always excellent."}
{"text":"So glad my friend Joli told me about this place. Met her there for lunch one day and it was so  delicious. I decided to take my mother there for dinner so she could have her first taste of Thai food and she loved it!!! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Delicious red curry.  The mango sticky rice was very tasty and a beautiful presentation."}
{"text":"I was here yesterday, and I had an \"okay\" experience
The inside of the place was exteremely dark. The table where I was sat, it was clear that the place did not clean their table cloths, I had crusty marks all over my table where the glass was not covering it.

The food was above okay, but not overly outstanding or anything noteable.
I had the Pad Thai Lunch Combo, it was roughly 7.75, comes with a spring roll, soup, and of course Pad Thai.

Service was okay, they were clearly busy, and they kept a smile on their face the whole time, which I have to applaud, for only 2 waiters and roughly 15-20 people in the house, I'm sure it was tough to manage."}
{"text":"Very pleasant surprise!   Great sushi stop. Miso soup was unique and spiced very well."}
{"text":"This place is as authentic as you can get!  We've lived in Bangkok and hadn't found good Thai in Clt until Chef Thai.  Their papaya salad and beef cucumber salads are perfect.  The curry is absolutely amazing.  Really can't believe that this is in Concord, which often has seemed like a food desert."}
{"text":"Are here for lunch and was quite surprised with the food and service. There were very few other patrons, but probably because it was close to the Thanksgiving holiday and everyone was still eating leftovers. I enjoyed my hurricane roll and my husband liked his  green curry and drunken noodles. We appreciated our attentive server who was constantly refilling our beverages."}
{"text":"Fresh rolls are delicious.. The crispy spring rolls also delicious... The Som Tum (papaya salad) is phenomenal and so fresh and crunchy..... Also one of the best I've ever tasted! Pad Thai also on point!! They are very consistent with making food... Haven't been disappointed yet  and I don't think I will ever be eating at Chef Thai... I live in s charlotte but when in the area this is the only place I'm eating at! Can't even believe this amazing place is tucked away in a concord shopping center"}
{"text":"We ate here today for the first time, and I feel so bad that we have been ignoring this delicious place for several years because long ago it was Bangkok Garden (which was a terrible experience) and we never realized until now that they changed hands!  So obviously the inside has been changed after all these  years.  We were very pleasantly surprised with everything--the lunch specials, the service, and the quality of the food were all excellent.  Our family will def be back!"}
{"text":"Had the steamed dumplings and red curry with chicken (hot) subbed brown rice. It was soooooo good! The only issue I had was the temperature of the restaurant. I went yesterday (95 degrees out) and it was 90 degrees in the restaurant. Might be why they were not offering sushi? Great price, service, and food."}
{"text":"I would have gave it a 5-star, but the short staff gave it away to a 4-star as well as the pricing to some items we ordered. 

The guy that greeted us was super generous! He sat us down right away after taking care of the other customers. After ordering our food, my 19 months old daughter was feeling sick and puked everywhere, but he was kind enough to clean the area. It did take awhile for our food to arrived, but like I mentioned, they were short on staff. There were probably 3 people. One in the back, one making sushi and the other one running around taking order so we were okay with it. About 15 minutes, we got our food and it was SUPER DELICIOUS! I've been on the hunt to find good sushi and papaya place & I found it. We ordered the Sassy Girl and my husband & I loved it. The papaya salad was the best one we have ever tasted, but we didn't like the price at all. $9.95 for a little plate of papaya that could be $5. 

After we ate, we waited for our check but that took forever! Since they were short on hand and the time we were waiting for our check, there were at least 2 tables waiting for their food and 3 take-out. They took care of take-out orders first though. About 30 minutes of waiting, they guy finally came and gave us the check. Would definitely go back, but not on a Friday or weekend night."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a handful of times, mostly for dinner.  Yesterday I decided to get some pineapple fried rice with shrimp and chicken for lunch.  Since I only have 30 minutes for lunch, I called my order in for pick up before leaving my job.  My lunch was not ready when I arrived about seven minutes later.  I had to wait probably another ten minutes for it after I arrived.  I drove back to my job and had about 5 minutes to inhale it.  It was very good fried rice.  The raisins were a nice touch and the portion was large.  In fact, I still have have half of it in the fridge for leftovers.  On a side note, I was impressed that they lined the foam container with aluminum foil.  I'm not sure if it was to keep it warm longer or to prevent the foam container from melting, but I was a nice attention to detail.  My only issue with the dish was the price.  I felt a little ripped off considering I paid $13.86 for chicken and shrimp and I only got 4 pieces of shrimp.  There was twice as much chicken as there was shrimp.  For that price, the ratio should be 50/50.  Other than that, Chef Thai is a solid Thai spot.  It's tied for my second favorite in the Huntersville/Concord/Kannapolis area.  I certainly will go back, just not at lunch so I more that five minutes to enjoy it."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai in such an unsuspecting location! The Tom Kha soup and \"cheese rolls\" appetizers were to die for! Masaman Curry simply wonderful! Can't wait to eat here again (and we haven't even left yet)!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today with a friend. We ordered a bit of everything and shared it all. Started with the soft spring rolls and steamed pork dumplings - both were delicious but I definitely wanted another round of spring rolls! Next we shared a spicy tuna roll and an eel and avocado roll - again they didn't disappoint. Given that the basic rolls were good, I'm sure their specialty rolls would be. We topped our sampler off with chicken pad Thai mildly spicy and it was the perfect ending (and I'm slightly picky about my Thai). As for the service, you can tell they're a family run business and genuinely care about keeping their customers happy. Each time we finished, the plates were cleared in a quick and polite manner. Our waitress was more than friendly and (thank goodness) she kept our drinks topped off. I will definitely return again soon!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to like it, but I should have let the service missteps clue me in on problems.  The dining room was ice cold and I had to go look for the hostess to be seated.  After 10 minutes at the table, I finally grabbed the hostess again to ask to order, upon which she produced my server for the first time.  After watching the table which arrived after me get their food well before me, I was getting pretty annoyed.  Chopsticks had some kind of sauce on the end of them.  Details can tell the story

Ordered a two piece Hamachi sushi with a Philly roll to start.  Yes, it's a Tuesday,  but if your supposed sushi grade Hamachi isn't up to snuff, you don't offer it.  Was afraid to eat the second piece.  I don't know who decided to put raw asparagus on the Philly roll, but it was a terrible decision.  Flavor and texture both were off because of it.  End pieces were 75% rice, so I really got 3/4 of the advertised roll

What to say about the Lad Bar with Chicken?  Drowning in sauce, I had to dig around to find the noodles, which were stuck together in one big clump.  What Thai place can't cook noodles?  The majority of the food was only warm while the broccoli burned the roof of my mouth and my tongue like hot pizza.  How did they do that?

I was sitting in the parking lot of the Logan ' s Roadhouse when I did the quick Yelp search to find this place.  Turned around and passed my hotel to come here instead.

You guys let me down this time"}
{"text":"I really like this place! The sushi is always very good and edamame is salted just enough. I do wish they would bring out the appetizer first and not with your meal. Nice dining area and very clean. The staff and cooks are a little noisy amongst each other but it's not busy either."}
{"text":"Came here with my family on 7.22.2016. Place was pretty empty when Inarrived around 2pm .  Waitress was friendly enough and gave us plenty of time to peruse the menu .  Ordered the lunch Thai Basil with Chicken , sushi-philly roll and Thai fried rice . Everything was delicious and perfectly cooked . Would definitely come back to try more dishes. Was in Thailand recently and the dishes we're definitely comparable to what I had over there . I would say the food is fresh , authentic and simply delicious ."}
{"text":"I've had sushi all over and this wasn't impressive.   I had the beauty and the beast. A mix of tuna and eel.  It was ok.  The fish was fresh, but nothing spectacular.  It was really quiet inside with only one other customer inside. 
Even during lunch at 1215 when i2 left there were only two other customers.  The seats were older and i sank down when I sat which made the table higher than I'd like to eat from.  Service was timely and friendly.   
The bathrooms were so- so.   The soap was out and the toilet paper in my stall ran out. Not impressive for a restaurant.  
Too many restaurants in the area to go to you come back to this one again."}
