{"text":"Inside the plaza of Kennedy and bur oak.  Used to be pixel 8. Similar concept with rice, Ramen, bubble tea etc.  OK quality food, I just feel like I can taste the MSG at first bite but it's at a good price so I can't complain. Parking is never an issue since it's inside a small plaza away from the main street.   Overall I'd come back again but I wouldn't push to promote this place for any kind of amazing food."}
{"text":"Interesting atmosphere.  The food is eh, decent. I like how the soup of the ramen doesn't taste too salty, but i wish it just had a little more flavour. The portion sizes are also tiny! For the price, I can get three times bigger portion at the pho place next door.   Food seems very pricey compared to the portion sizes and quality."}
{"text":"We decided to take a chance on this new joint.   Being a new restaurant, we were the only patrons that night and of course, the service was stellar.  I loved the fact all the people outside were eyeing the menu and trying to peer through the window.   My husband and I tried out the popcorn chicken ($6.25) and the chicken katsu ramen ($7.99).     The popcorn chicken was delicious.   Not too salty, good crunch and very flavourful.   They even had basil leaves too.   The only downside is that the price was a bit high for what you get.   The chicken katsu was also done well.  It wasn't overly oily.   The chicken was not over cooked and I liked the sweet sauce provided.   The ramen was not bad.   The texture of the noodles could be a little less soft, but it was not mushy by any means.   The presentation for the noodles, however, could have been way better, ie put more corn, added the spring onions to the top, layered more seaweed.   I thought the price was reasonable.     I'd try this place again for its other ramen offerings and perhaps try other food options."}
{"text":"First time here for snack such as chk wings, chk popcorn and honey green tea. Impressive!  2nd time here for dinner and the chk wings still good as before! I like the soup from my ramen, not too salty. However, improvement for the noodle could make it the best ramen in town."}
{"text":"the workers are rude never say thank you and slam the menus on the table. they also demand tips and will stare at you until you give it  the food is still good for instance the egg I like it  however they are in small portions so you will still be hungry  sometimes there is hair in the food too which is not yummy !!  the restaurant is clean and you can expect to spend around $10 here"}
{"text":"Went back over the weekend. Food is ok for the price. Added $2 to the seafood ramen for a bubble tea for my youngest son. Good for a no-frills no line-up quick meal."}
{"text":"I was disappointed to hear Pixel8 had closed but gave its replacement, Smart Cook, a try anyway on a Saturday at 3pm.   VENUE/AMBIANCE The interior is unchanged from its previous days. Lots of small 2-4 tables and booths, a little worn, but clean and tidy. There was one other table seated when we arrived.   SERVICE A waiter greeted and seated us immediately when we arrived. He did hover a little (maybe because we were the only table in the front section) but was quick to come over when we were ready to order. He knew the menu well and readily answered any questions we had (eg. What is a volcano ramen??). 3.5 stars.   FOOD We ordered a pork belly ramen and a popcorn chicken ramen. Food came really quickly. My iced milk tea was super watery when it arrived and I was disappointed after the first sip. A more experienced waitress noticed I didn't touch my tea and replaced it with a second glass before I said anything - much appreciated! Ramen was slightly overdone but the soup base was alright. Generous portions of pork belly (tender) and popcorn chicken (a little too chewy). 3.5 stars.   QUALITY/VALUE At $8.25, plus an extra $1.25 for upgrading to a cold drink, the price isn't justified for the quality of food and location. 3 stars.   OVERALL Although I miss Pixel8, Smart Cook does a decent job replacing them but there are still a couple things they need to work on to boost their sales. 3 stars."}
{"text":"Update - The value for lunch is pretty good.  All entree items on lunch menu is under $7.  Add $2 to get a milk tea.  Lunch time goes to 5pm.  ======= Smart Cook takes over the space where Pixel 8 used to be.  I would describe Smart Cook as an Asian fusion eatery.  The restaurant titles itself as ramen & cafe, so there are some ramen, terriyaki rice, and izayaka styled snacks.  The fusion part comes in as there are also some Taiwanese styled food, Korean styled rice, bubble tea, etc.  The menu are filled with entrées perfect for lunch: ramen, rice bowls and snacks .  If customers want to dine in family style, they must work around the menu.  We ordered a rice bowl with grilled eel ($8.25), a rice bowl with Korean beef and kimchi ($8.25) and a chicken ramen ($7.95).  The ramen broth was not up to the standard of a ramen speciality eatery/restaurant.  It was not rich enough.  The ramen was also pretty average.  On the other hand, the ramen was way cheaper, had more noodle, meat and garnishment.  So this was a quantity and value over quality thing.  If you feel like a simple, well portioned, budget ramen, and you don't mind it be lower in quality, this is what you are looking for.  My dining companions ate the two rice bowls.  I took a bite of the eel and the Korean beef only.  I liked the eel more, as it was soft, juicy and tasty.  The Korean beef was good, but I found the kimchi flavour quite mild.  Both rice bowls were well portioned.  The ambiance is pleasant, young, trendy yet down to earth.  There are a few televisions hung on wall.  They were showing videos of some menu items when we arrived.  The services was friendly, polite, fast and effective.  It could be because there were only two tables of customers.  Nevertheless, based on the menu, I guess that the owner focuses on the lunch crowd anyway."}
{"text":"Same staff, same decor, same location but food is definitely not the same.  Once upon a time, this restaurant was known as Pixel8 which now have become Smart Cook.    They have selections between $6.95 - $10 ranging from rice bowls to ramen, udon, taiwanese style snack and drinks.  The rice bowls do not come with a drink but ramen and udons do.  On my visit, I tried the volcano ramen (my once favourite when it was pixel8).  The ramen was nice and chewy but not a fan of the ingredients.  There was half soft boiled egg, 3 shrimp, 1 stick of imitation crab meat, 2 narutomaki slices and a small sprinkling of corns.  This for $8.75 (incl hk milk tea) was a bit of a disappointment.  The hk milk tea i can give 4/5 but i would not recommend the volcano ramen.  The ramen was great but it lacked the spiciness that would justify this as \"volcano\".  My family ordered the popcorn shrimp and stone pot beef and egg on rice.  Both were pretty good (4-4.5/5).  Only peculiar thing was the salad put on top of the rice.  Would I come back? Maybe ... maybe .... I don't know yet"}
{"text":"3 stars for food. Healthy stir fry zucchini paired with plain rice (very little sauce)  and nicely fried popcorn chicken. All it lacks is a bit more flavour for the chicken and rice, perhaps pouring some sauce over the rice would be less plain and marinating the chicken more. The popcorn chicken meal was about $8.75 and came with a miso soup.   4 stars for their real fruit drinks! You can get it as a milkshake or frappé. They really do make it with fresh fruits! None of the cheap powder stuff like some bbt shops.. I ordered their avocado+papaya milkshake and the flavour was strong and perfectly creamy with lots of avocado not too sweet as well so it was delicious. Very impressed of the quality and it was only $3.48!   Will be coming back for their drinks :) hope they keep the quality up! Please don't cheap out on fresh fruits over time."}
{"text":"I found Smart Cook after having eaten at Pho Metro, which is next door. I made a mental note to come back and give ramen a try at Smart Cook.  I walked in and was asked whether I wanted takeout. Um, no. I'm by myself. I'm hungry. I want to eat in the restaurant.  I was promptly seated and given a couple of menus. There was a deal on slushies, so I went with a coconut and banana one. I also ordered the shio ramen. I love ramen, so I had to give it a go here.  The problem was that I actually had to hail someone working at the restaurant to place my order. I felt like I was hailing a taxi, waving my hands up like a maniac. It was only me without any food and another customer who was chowing down.  The slushie was good. It was thick, so it took me a bit of time to suck it down.  The shio ramen was okay. Nothing to write home about, but it did cure my hunger pangs.  Perhaps I need to try the popcorn chicken or something. My review doesn't exactly jive with all the outstanding reviews. My experience was just okay.  (23)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday for lunch. Surprisingly empty (only 3 tables were used around 12-12:30pm!). Ordered the deep fried crispy chicken ramen and Japanese pork belly udon with HK milk tea. I enjoyed the hot ramen broth and the springy ramen noodles. Each portion was okay for one - definitely closer to snack-sized rather than a stuffed-full lunch. It would be great value during the Monday to Friday lunch special for ~$2 less (~$6.50). I would return for this special, sans kids.   Unfortunately they had only one high chair for toddlers, so another family had to ask to see if we were done with ours so they could use it. We also weren't given any small spoons or knives to feed the kids so it was a bit difficult portioning out the food. Would recommend bringing your own portable highchairs and utensils if you are bringing small children.   Note: For $2 more you can upgrade your drink to a bubble tea."}
{"text":"Food and drink  - 7.8/10 Service - 5/10 Environment- 7/10  Overall: 3.5/5 stars   Food is worth the price, service is okay. Amazing bubble tea. Seating is slightly uncomfortable."}
{"text":"2.5 star   I have mixed feeling with Smart Cook.  A small family business serving unmemorable food. Price is good and you get a lot of food which is just ok. Nothing really stand out that I would be back or tell my friends to come and try that.  But having Smart Cook does give the neighbourhood more choices. The price is good for students next door for lunch.  Being a Ramen & Cafe, their Ramen was meh. Looked and tasted homemade. Having that as your signature and you really going to disappoint your customers."}
{"text":"Portions here are huge! Ordered the Korean beef kimchi rice and it comes with miso soup and an egg for $8.25. Place is huge and clean but it was very empty.  Popcorn chicken was tender BUT, it doesn't taste as authentic as it should be.  Waitress was very attentive and polite. Food wise it's alright. If you are lazy to cook and want something quick on a weekday then you should come here."}
