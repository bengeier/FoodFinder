{"text":"I can't speak for all of the Love's locations as I haven't visited them, however this location is good for sure. Always clean restrooms, nice clean well stocked store and a great Subway inside. Myself and my son will often drive out near Apex to watch the trains or will go exploring up Hwy 93 just North of this location. I think it deserves 5 stars as everyone has always been friendly and we have never had any issues."}
{"text":"I was filling up gas and it stopped at $14.40. I pulled the pump out (holding it in the air) and it kept on going stopping $15.76!! I can understand a pump can get faulty, but I am EXTREMELY disgusted with the customer service I received regarding this incident. None of the managers came out and acknowledged the situation and they refused a refund for the extra $1.36 (something that I didn't really care about anyway). The employees did a test on the pump and found that when they stopped pumping gas, the price would still continue and go up. If it weren't for this test, they wouldn't have refunded my money!!! I am not mad at the fact that I was overcharged, but I am more mad at the principle that they automatically denied the refund without even looking into the situation and the manager didn't even bother to come out to speak to me or apologize at that matter."}
{"text":"One of my go to places to stop along I-15 in Nevada. Good location where I-15 and US 93 split off. Plenty of parking and good prices for gas. Overall I definitely recommend this place for stopping."}
{"text":"I stop here on a daily basis for fuel and drinks and snacks. Fuel prices are very competitive compared to other truck stops. Sometimes around 4pm this place gets a little crazy and you have to jockey in to position for a fuel pump. The restrooms are always clean. They have a decent supply of commercial truck accessories along with personal products."}
{"text":"I stop at Love's when headed to Caliente or Pioche because it has everything you could need for a road trip. I stopped in to get drinks and snacks for our latest trip and debated getting something from the Godfather's Pizza they have inside. Between Godfather's and Subway the smells were killing me. It just smelled so good and other people thought so too because the line was no joke 20 plus people deep. you can order a whole pizza, but they don't sell it by the slice. They have the mini individual pizzas starting at $3.99 and you can make it a combo blah blah blah. I decided to peep out the jerky section. I remembered they had a lot to chose from the last time I was here and man was I right. I picked out a couple things and then went in search of something \"Hostess\" for my wife. Too bad they only had Little Debbie! It's all good my wife is a fan of her too so the iced honey bun I got her went over well. They have oil for your car, jerky, candy, drinks, pizza and even a gift shop area. Some things are way overpriced but that is to be expected. It's your typical gas station/convenient store with a few extra bonuses."}
{"text":"I really dislike this Loves location the folks are rude the pizza is in no way as good as the pizza from Subway. There was no hot dogs or sausages the fruit, cups they had out look like very poor quality . I can tell Love's has put tons of money, and work into this location. ( Thank You ) I sure hope the professionals at Love's headquarters steps in"}
{"text":"This is the second time in the past few months that we have stopped at Loves. Both times 2 of the 4 ladies toilets were out of order including the handicap. You would think that the high volume Loves does they would expand their restrooms! I'm gonna start stopping at the Indian Store their bathrooms are clean and no lines!"}
{"text":"Just outside of Las Vegas, in the middle of nowhere, The prices of the soda refills was ok, but not going to complain since out of town. 
Fast, friendly service,easy to get in and out of, diffidently a place to stop and get your road goodies!"}
{"text":"The employees are amazing!!! We ran out of gas and they were there to help in a second. Gives us faith in the world, there are wonderful people out there! Thank you Jordan and the caring lady on the diesel side. You both are such sweet people. Much love."}
{"text":"Adorable generic gas station that has the cutest little symbol hanging up high with a heart. I stopped here for good gas and quick snacks! My favorite gas station"}
{"text":"This review is more for the RV storage facility across the street. But they are one in the same business. 

DO NOT trust these people to provide the service they claim to provide.  We pay for two spaces with pper to keep our batteries topped off. And every single time we have made our way up to check on our rig the power is out and our batteries are dead. They fail to keep the other tenants here under control as the have people running a fridge and air conditioning on the 20 amp connection shared by a number of units. What's worse is not only have they completely killed my brand new battery bank but they refuse to do anything about it. This place fails at customer service and fails at even providing the services you pay for.  It looks nice and is apparently fairly secure but that is all. I wouldnt tust them with anything beyond that. 

Terible business"}
{"text":"Good place to stop for all of your needs.  Subway and godfathers inside.  Usually greeted with a \"welcome to loves\". Gas, food, gaming, clothing, beverages, phone chargers, just about anything you could ever need.  It's close to work for me so I am here quite often, and have zero complaints.

If the line ever gets long they immediately grab another cashier"}
{"text":"What can I say, really. It's a truck stop/gas station. They usually stay competitive with the gas prices in Rock Hill and I often find myself stopping here rather than the Petro Express in RH. Why you ask? Wide open pumps and is typically not as crowded as the other stations across the bridge, Free Air & Water. Big, clean restrooms big enough to breakdance in. Not to mention the lot is huge so cars can come & go freely without a traffic jam happening. Plus there's a Subway inside if I want a snack. I typically look on the trucker's side to look at the neat little gadgets and whatnot. 
Plus it's right off the interstate, easy to get to... no other businesses around to cause a traffic nightmare."}
{"text":"Really like those 2/$5 fruit cups -especially when they have watermelon and the weather's hot.

This location also has a Subway and a Godfather's pizza on site.

Also, this location has good souveniers."}
{"text":"The store is my go to stop on the way to Vegas and on the way home. The bathrooms have been very clean every time I have been here. It gets very busy and there is sometimes a pretty lengthy wait for gas pumps and bathrooms."}
{"text":"The restrooms are down to two working urinals out of the six. It's a nightmare here. As a trucker there's a long line which blocks truck parking from leaving or parking in the front ( nearest parking spots ). Idk who thought it was a good idea to turn the diesel pumps opposite then all the other truck love stations?? It's obviously a error in building and who ever was in charge. Avoid this spot, if your in/ on a schedule."}
{"text":"This is the worst truck stop. I am never going to stop their again! I heard the graveyard employees talking about how they dropped the meat in the walk in and picked it back up. That is just disgusting. God knows what else they do to the food there. I had stopped in the morning before this incident, and the manager Chad was nowhere to be found. I waited awhile and he still wasnt available. No conference call, nothing. Just wasnt available. This place is so unprofessional, but this last incident is what did it for me."}
{"text":"Nykki at Subway has exceptional attention to detail. She warmed up some components of my sandwich to make it more uniform and advised me of changes to available components. 

I have no complaints about the rest of the facility. :)"}
{"text":"Great place to stop right before you get into the city. The place is huge and literally has everything you never thought you needed. They even have a godfathers pizza (Omaha, NE pizza chain). 

The only down size is they don't have any grass for dogs to, you know but it is the desert so I can understand."}
{"text":"I stopped here yesterday on the way back from Caliente.  This Love's opened a little more than a year ago, and it's an easy on/off from the freeway.  There is plenty of parking space in front for cars and in the back for trucks.

Gas prices are higher than some places, but they don't gouge you like some freeway gas stations.  The store is fully stocked with snacks, drinks, and all kinds of travel needs.  There's a sub shop and a pizza shop in the mart.  Restrooms are clean (I assume the women's room is).  

This is but one more option when the needle on the gauge is getting into that uncharted territory you'd rather not explore.  It's also a sight for sore eyes when your bladder is that uncomfortable zone and you're not sure you'll be safe until you get to a Starbuck's."}
{"text":"My gas tank hadn't been filled for quite a while and I wanted to get some more before heading onto Utah. This Love's station features a full stop for truckers and travelers alike. They have a couple dining options with Subway and Godfather's pizza. Inside the station there are plenty of drink and candy options. I ended up getting some of their ice tea, which 1.50 for a huge large cup was a killer deal. Lots of coffee options too, but no ice coffee unfortunately. The bathrooms were large, very clean and well stocked. Employees seemed super friendly as well, great place to stop if you wish to avoid stopping in Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this gas station. It's just a regular, standard gas station, but the logo and the name speak to me."}
{"text":"Strategically located pit and gas stop before you head out on Nevada Highway 93 or I-15, because after you pass there the pickings become very slim, especially on Highway 93. I usually stop here when I pass through. They have a Subways and a pizza place if you're hungry. They also have a well stocked convenience store and the restroom facilities are decently clean."}
{"text":"We broke down at this station... spent about 6 hours there for our towing service until a good Samaritan / subway sandwich worker saw us take out our jumper cables (to start our generator for air conditioning). He tried to jump the car (even though we said it wasn't the battery)... but then he asked if we spoke to the Love's mechanics. WTF? There are mechanics there??? We just spent 6 hours waiting for a tow in 109 degrees with our dog in heat stroke. In 15 minutes they drove over and helped jump it. Car started, but the mechanic realized our battery wire was burnt. He changed it - the next morning we paid $100 for the mechanic to drive to Vegas to get us a new part and install it. Very nice mechanic... hilarious! 

And they sent us on our way - 

However, I wish they would have realized the alternator was about to go out - we had mentioned the belt sound and the dim lights... but it just didn't click. None of us had any idea that this would  be the first of 5 break downs to come... all for the alternator! 

Anyhow, If you find yourself at this stop - there is a semi truck mechanic area on the other side of the building. No one tells you and it's hard to see. But there are mechanics there. They may be able to help you (7am-11pm). 

Thank you to the Subway Sandwich worker who stopped to help! You were the only one who even looked our way for 6 hours!"}
{"text":"If you are trying to avoid lines and hordes of people avoid this place.  However I do have to say that the place is ran like a well oiled Machine.  The workers at the Subway were super efficient I was pleasantly surprised. They work through a long line very quickly. Fuel seems very expensive here"}
{"text":"My car broke down and I was lucky enough to make it to Exit 64 off of I15 to Loves. Mickey was running the cash register and noticed how upset I was trying to handle my situation in 113 degree heat with two kids in tow. She was very kind, helpful, and professional. The establishment was clean, well stocked and had everything a traveler could need. The fruit looked better than most big chain grocery stores. The prices are reasonable too.Nice to have the option of not just snacks with Pizza and Subway on site as well....But it was employees like Mickey that make all the difference sometimes! Thanks Mickey!"}
{"text":"The bathrooms were clean, gas price was reasonable but our favorite part was talking with the awesome woman named Sandra who was behind the cash register. People at roadside gas stations are rarely so friendly and just plain kind. I hope Sandra's boss knows what a gem she is."}
{"text":"I actually like stopping here, often on my way to other places.  It's always clean, brightly lit (which is important in the dark hours of the night), and the staff is always friendly.  Whatever I want/need, they have it.  If you need to stop on your way out of Las Vegas, or your way into town, it's worth stopping here."}
{"text":"If you're headed south on I-15, you have to travel 6 miles on another road to rejoin I-15 southbound.  WEIRD!!!  Nice and clean location.  Loves is my favorite truck stop.  Parking was not very good, as regular car spots seemed limited and there were a ton of trucks parked everywhere."}
{"text":"Easy on and off the freeway, but this place can get insanely crazy with people."}
{"text":"It's a truck stop!  LOL.  What am I really supposed to say...When I was a truck driver there were only certain gas stations that my company would allow us to go to. I don't remember if this was one of them...Anyway, the only food choices were Subway and Godfathers pizza...boooooo.  I had my own food.  hehe.  Nothing exciting to comment about.  The cashier's were ok.  As long as I was greeted in a nice manner.  Ohhhh the women's bathroom..GAWDDD the line was superrrr long. and of course the men's bathroom, well, you can just walk right in...(if you were a guy that it...) LOLOL!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I travel a lot, we love driving cross country stopping when we need too or want too, keeping up with the truck stops when we do. Love's is always clean, prices are reasonable but they can be busy.  

Inside, there is snacks, drinks, tobacco and coffee, but there is also a pizza shop and sandwich shop if you want something heartier. Of course there are other items for sale, like truck gear, CB antenna's and road maps.

The bathrooms are clean and big, so when the place is busy, there are plenty of stalls for everyone."}
{"text":"They're OK -- just don't expect to pay with a Subway card  They don't accept them contrary to their website  However, if you have some Love's fuel points that need burning up, they do accept those"}
{"text":"I drive by this truck stop every time from home (Overton) to Vegas (work). Might I say this is the busiest gas station for sure. Competitive prices and the employees are friendly. It's a truck stop and they have a Subway too! By the looks of it, it looks like Love's is expanding for RV and boat storage too. Way to go!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness for this pit stop before entering Las 
Vegas as we were driving back from St George, Utah where we had Chick-Fil-A. I had a sudden urge & need to have to use the restroom facilities. Boy did I luck out in time. There were four in the ladies restroom but there was a wait. On top of all that I had to go back again. Sorry for the TMI!

Anyway, the travel stop itself was good sized that you can order pizza or sandwiches plus they carry a lot of souvenir stuff and lots of snacks!!! I did like that as I'm a sucker for snacks and cute plushes!

Stop here if you need to; you'll be glad you did!"}
