{"text":"So, one of my Meetup groups had an outing planned here that I wasn't able to make but the name intrigued me.  Automatically I started thinking that I don't know if I would want to eat at a place that eludes to anything that is gastrointestinal related.  However, my curiosity continued to get the best of me despite the name, so I checked out the website.  I was impressed with what I saw.  I'm a crazy picky eater so there are some dishes on the menu that you couldn't pay me to try, but there were also several that excited my stomach.  I'm a music junkie so I became even more excited when I read that different local DJs hit the ones and twos every night!  I said to myself, \"Self, we are so going to Soul Gastrolounge!\"    One of my friends and I met up there on a Friday night around 9:00 and the place was packed!  There's a really cool outdoor patio that overlooks the street and inside is dimly lit and full of a laid-back, eccentric vide.  I thought to myself, \"I've found where I belong (tear, sniffle, sniffle).\"  My friend and I were told that we would have an hour and 15 minute wait, which normally would've sent us packing but we were fully committed.  So, we chose to wait at Twenty-Two (check out my review) which is right below S.G.  When it was time for us to be seated we were lead to a bar right by the DJ booth (who was awesome btw).  Our server came by in a matter of seconds to take our drink orders and then we perused the menu.  Since I had already looked at it online I decided to order the Soul Wings (I wasn't feeling as adventurous that night but trust me I'll going back to try oh so much more.) and the french fries with garlic-herb salt, pecorino & truffle oil.  The wings were okay but I loved the fries.  Our server came back to check on us several times throughout our stay and was pretty darn amazing.    I'll definitely be back here.  The food options are just about limitless, reasonably priced and the service was awesome.  I say \"YES\" to Soul Gastrolounge and you should too!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time this week...fantastic. Sat at the bar/DJ booth, we're sat right away by the friendly hostesses. Very hip place, reminded me of Carrboro. For all of its hipness, no one we spoke to was rude or condescending. Our server Drew was friendly, helpful and the perfect amount of attentive. Food was great: two sushi rolls, the Korean wings and the pork belly tacos was a good amount for two. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Truffle Fries!! Definitely a must when you visit Soul! Great atmosphere and friendly down to earth staff!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sat night with another couple and will return! The restaurant sits on the corner of Central & Pecan and is upstairs with a really nice view of the city. The atmosphere is casual sophistication with a nice relaxed feeling inside. The service was lacking but the food more than made up for it. The service was not bad it was just slow and not because she was waiting on the kitchen but because she did not seem to know what she was doing. Maybe she was new.....I asked what was good and she proceeded to tell me what the most expensive items were, not a good idea. The Bruscetta, Ahi Tuna Skewer, Southern Fried Oysters and Dip Trio were wonderful as well as the sushi (surprisingly), the meatballs was the only thing that I did not care for. The wine selection was quite good as well."}
{"text":"Great food. Great patio. So much on the menu, you'll want to go a few times to try everything!"}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. They have creative and unique menu items, tapas (small plates for you Anglophones), interesting cocktails and the best bartenders in town. Getting up to the bar is like a game for me and I love it. How many people can I squeeze by to get into the prime seating?  The vibe at Soul is upscale, most nights there is a DJ, it's dark and a little loud, but somehow still pulls itself off as a speakeasy-like atmosphere. Definitely come here with a small group. Big groups will never get seated -- just not enough space. Sharing tapas is the best way to go here. I have never eaten a meal here without sharing their fries, a generous portion of garlicky, perfectly delicious fries. Shoe string style if you were wondering. I, also, highly recommend their sushi. The Soul roll is one of my faves, not overly spicy, so don't let those jalape√±os scare you off.   If you want interesting cocktails you have come to the right place. Check out their menu with tons of house favorites (Basil Smash) or tell Adam or one of the other awesome bartenders what you like and they will mix up something special just for you.   On most nights and ALL weekends you will wait at Soul, for sometimes up to an hour, but it is totally worth it. Elbow in at the bar and order some cocktails and hummus to keep you happy while you wait. If you can snag a place on the patio on a night with good weather, you have definitely hit the jackpot. Perfect view of the Charlotte skyline. Soul is a great date spot -- nothing like getting to know someone by sharing food.   Soul has always been an ultra hip spot in the sea of a semi-hip place, but now that Plaza Midwood is growing up, I think Soul compliments its neighbors well (ie: Peculiar Rabbit and Twenty Two). If you have someone you want to impress in Charlotte, go ahead and head over to Soul Gastrolounge."}
{"text":"Adam by far is the most talented bartender in CLT. I gave him a liquor selection and he masterfully created a cocktail that not only satisfied but took my senses to the next level. I am inspires by the menu and humbled by the bartenders talent. Do not miss this under shadowed hotspot!"}
{"text":"We had a great time. We went after reading the review, and we did not regret it.. It is a small place with a laid back atmosphere. I would recommend going as a party two. We choose four dishes including a desert and split the food. Everything we tried was awesome. We also saw  many other dishes that looked delicious. We will have to go back another time to try them all!"}
{"text":"In Charlotte for the night, and stopped by based on the previous reviews. Excellent  food and drinks. It's tapas and a little pricey, so it's probably not the place to go if you're starving. But I'd certainly recommend it for a nice, relaxing, upscale happy hour."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the hype, this restaurant lacks in good tasting food (which is my most important factor). Getting tasty food is like hitting the lottery here, there might be one or two items on the menu worth stomaching. Service and atmosphere are ok, but the marathon wait times and bland dishes are a detractor for the average patron. You've been warned!"}
{"text":"The food is great and priced well considering. Great staff and laid back environment. This is a perfect date night or small group venue. If you need to compensate more than 6  MAKE A RESERVATION AND CHECK IT TWICE!!!  I made a reservation for my birthday a while back, called a few times to confirm and had less than stellar replies to comfort me that all was taken care of with the exception of the first conversation saying I was all set. That wasn't the case and on the event night, no reservation existed. We waited for hours for a table that never became available. We had cocktails there, but dinner elsewhere, which had to be decided last minute."}
{"text":"The food was very fun and imaginative while the ambiance was funky and relaxed.  My dinner date and I arrived on a Saturday night at 5:00pm, when they first opened, and we were seated immediately.  I love the ambiance of the restaurant.  It has a trendy, young vibe.  Good music, alternative looking waitstaff, clean, yet interesting decor with the exposed ceiling beams and red brick walls.  We started with an x-rated martini and the drink special of the night, the cucumber-mint mojito.  While the martini was a bit over-priced ($11) and not that tasty in my opinion, I really enjoyed the mojito.  Typically mojitos are quantity over quality (aka low liquor content), but not this one.  There was a good balance of all of the flavors.  We picked from a wide array of items from the menu, from dips to small plates.  My favorite item was the asia pork-belly tacos with watermelon salsa.  Though this sounds like a strange combination of ingredients, it worked perfectly!  I love when dishes have contrasting tastes and textures that work together in harmony, and this hit the mark on both counts.  The garlic and truffle oil fries were really good as well, though I always love me a little extra truffle oil, which this lacked.  Our waiter, Justin, was awesome, he managed to always be there when we needed him for ordering another drink to bringing extra condiments, but he was not obnoxiously ever-present.  I will definitely go here again!  It is clear that this restaurant is run with an emphasis on giving each patron a quality, unique dining experience."}
{"text":"Noisy spot, good nightlife and great grub! One suggestion, the foie gras....not what it should be. But try it yourself and call me a liar if you must!"}
{"text":"So the hostess was perhaps top three least friendly people I have ever met, once I sat down, however, I was very glad I had come. The shrimp ceviche was fantastic, the sushi very good, and the caramel chocolate bread pudding sublime. I'll be coming back for sure, but probably seating myself."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. We come here very often. Not so uptight. It's casual dressy, a very relaxed environment. Love it."}
{"text":"Walked in and the music was by Zero 7 which is just a great album to chill to, so I was sold right away.  We went with tapas instead of sushi and it was very good.  The braised ribs were great, the fried oysters were great, the pita chips with a goat cheese and white bean dip was great.  Decent alcohol selection and the mix of people was awesome - suits, tattoos/piercings, young, old, hip, not hip (that would be me).  Duy Huynh paintings on the wall - i loved it and will be back soon if someone will babysit my kids for me.  Thanks a bunch."}
{"text":"All in all one of my favorite places. Hits all points for creativity, taste, service, ambiance. I kind of wishes they took reservations cause if it is past about 7:30 on a weekend the place is packed and there's a wait, and sometimes The bathrooms could use some help sometimes but I think that has to do with fact that at night there are a lot of people using just two bathrooms. Still, it is an area that could be improved upon I think. I love some Soul!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Soul! The atmosphere is what makes the place my favorite- the cozy, funky, warm environment of sharing small plates throughout the night encourages conversation and sparks smiles!! :) This is always my #1 go to spot!"}
{"text":"long... But worth the wait, defiantly one of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte. This is the best eclectic hot spot in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Amazing dining experience.  Tried several tapas and several sushi along w few different cocktails.  Everything was excellent.   Great new place.   Like all new places it is always jammed and they don't take reservations  but alas the wait is well worth it!!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant in town. Great vibes. Fantastic food and cocktails. Pork belly tacos are vital, but you truly cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. Be there between 5:00-6:00PM on a weekday if you do not want to wait quite a while for a table."}
{"text":"Given the high ratings this restaurant has, I was extremely disappointed with my dinner at Soul Gastrolounge. We ordered the baba ghanoush dip, Korean wings, sticky veal shortrib, and the southern fried oysters. I was underwhelmed by the flavor of all four. The crispy pita chips that were paired with the eggplant dip were very hard and tasteless. The Korean wings had a kick but little taste. The sticky veal shortribs were not cooked correctly. The only reason I would come back here would be to try more of their cocktails. I had the Wounded Margaret, which tasted similar to a Bloody Mary mixed with balsamic. The cocktail was the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Very unhappy with this place, booked it for a friends birthday received a text at 8.11 got to the restaurant at 8.14 and they gave our table away because we were considered late! WTF!!!! I have never seen such bad service, rude staff and the management is even worse. Never will you see any of my money."}
{"text":"Food is over priced but delicious, atmosphere and decor is so unique but the people are a tad booshy and uppity."}
{"text":"Great service and yummy food. I  decided to venture to Soul for the first time thinking the rainy day would reduce the wait time.  It didn't for most of the guests, but I used the spp, and came solo,  so I was drafted upon arrival. Tiana was a superbly friendly Anna knowledgeable server. I tried everything she recommended and she was spot on.  The sushi was great and the Korean wings were superb. The bartender didn't skimp on the liquor and the cocktails were delicious.  The atmosphere was the best part.  The dj wasn't there yet, but the background music had me dancing in my seats.  The vibe alive was worth the trip and the food was a bonus."}
{"text":"The Bottom Line: a wide range of unusual tapas that will have you eating your face off.  Pros: - The service was excellent. - The food was delicious. - If you're a carnivore, omnivore or herbivore... you are in for a treat.  Cons: - This is really minor. More could be done with the outside area given the excellent views of the city."}
{"text":"Charlotte's hottest spot for the semi-well to do but not really, is a place called Soul Gastrolounge which is inspired by the gastropubs of European origin that serve small plates and libations all throughout the wee hours of the night.    You'll find everything here, darkness, trendsters, hipsters, scenesters, nerd alerts, creepos, weeaboos, ceos cheating on their wives, questionably bent dudes in pink shirts, cuckqueens and mystic trannies along with a life sized stuff peacoack on the wall that makes for an excellent segue from awkward and potentially friendship ruining topics about butthole worship.    The drinks were excellent, with everything being cucumber infused which refreshes the palate for the next small dish.  Dubs had the hummus which sadly, tasted more bland than a glass luke warm camel's milk but her 2nd choice of meatballs with cream sauce was an excellent dish, except the waitress took away the dip far too early and left me with dry meatballs that was a bit difficult to swallow.    Our baritone voiced waiter who had a voice for radio and a face for the sequel of Arnold's all time smash hit \"Jingle All the Way\", recommended the watermelon & pork soft tacos which was exquisite.  I would recommend eating with a fork and knife because the tortilla, which was about the size of Dub's baby hands, was purely there for \"deckorayshun\".    Last of all, the friend chicken skin pimento cheese nachos was also a winner.  Overall, this is a good place to kick it where service is fast and tables so close together so that the woman sitting next to you can correct you about actually being able to see the July 4th fireworks, when in fact I was right, and you can't see the fireworks."}
{"text":"had a great time with my husband and his old friends from his childhood.my now brother in law jon is da bomb in the kitchen!!and over all these guys know how to run a restaurant."}
{"text":"Perhaps my favorite restaurant in Charlotte despite a few negatives. The food is phenomenal. Great variety, well worth the money. The downside is that you have to be strategic about when to go because it is always busy, especially during the weekends. Not a place to go with a large group of people for the same reason. My first attempt to go there, I went with a group of  8 on a Friday night and waited 2 hours, and ended up leaving. The hostess was rude and the impression that we got from their service was that they can afford to be rude because their food is so GREAT and customers are willing to overlook that.  My next time around, it was better... but then again I went on a Wednesday night  with one friend at 9pm (still crowded but wait was 5min).   In sum, my 5 star rating is for the food quality and the ambiance once you are seated."}
{"text":"Food amazing! The wait was more than I would have liked. They told us a 30 minute wait and then  we waited an hr."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends for the first time. We arrived around 6pm and there were still tables available outside. It was a chilly day, but they had it enclosed with heaters on. Order the pork belly, Korean bbq wings. Sunflower hummus, and blue cheese burger sliders. The pork belly was crisp with just enough sweet sauce. My friend said the Korean winds were spicy and the portion was 6 wings and they looked nice and crisp. The sliders needed a bit more mayo, but the crispy onion was very tasty. The hummus was good and came with plenty is pita chips. Dishes took a bit long to come out but it seemed rather busy."}
{"text":"Visiting from DC and Rome, nice place but major attitude by the 18 year old hostess who barked at us the minute we walked in. The place smells like food, kitchen needs major work. The manager saved the day."}
{"text":"Yes, this is my second review. I liked it more the second time. We got two orders of the mini burgers and the tuna tacos. My fav is still the cuban sandwich. the only cuban sandwich I like. It's not the most kid-friendly place but we were eating early so we took them. My 5 year old actually ate a southern fried oyster. He loved it! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch and ordered the southern heritage. The gravy was meh, the biscuits were dry and my bacon was over cooked. I know it is a small plate place, but I would have liked a larger portion for brunch. Other than that the service was okay and the atmosphere was pretty cool. They had a DJ for brunch. What."}
{"text":"I mean, this is probably my fave place to chug and grub! The sushi is phenomenal. I always, ALWAYS get the Napolean roll. It never disappoints. The service is pretty great. The place is pretty small and can get packed and busy fairly quick. I love that there is always a feature menu - the chef creates something new to taste nightly. They have a twitter account and tweet their new items which make me get off the phone (while i'm driving) and drive right there.   I'm no longer in Charlotte but love to see their menu items scroll down my TL. Great to go solo or with a group. P.S. The DJ's are greaaaatttttt!!!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite places in Charlotte.  The drinks and food are amazing, creative and worth the wait and cramped quarters!!!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious!! Service was great! Only reason I didn't give five stars was because the lighting is so dark!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and everything we had was awesome! I recommend the fried meatballs, flat bread and their sushi.  The mountain oysters are worth a try if you haven't had them before, very unique texture :-). You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is high on the list to take friends when they come into town.  Good food, good atmosphere, good wine/drinks.  As some have mentioned, no reservations so it is often crowded with a wait.  But still worth it.  I could list all the good things but it would be easier to just say that I've yet to have anything I did not thoroughly enjoy.  Parking can also require some creativity on crowded nights.  But I love a challenge.  Fun fact:  I have been coming to this location since it was \"The Perch\" comedy club back in the day.  4.5 soul's out of 5"}
{"text":"I don't even want to give this place 1 star. Whenever my wife and I go out , ever, we dress up a little. We just like too, no reason. The hostess at this place looked at us like we had 8 heads because we didn't have the typical slummin it  for the night look, that apparently is the in thing there. I asked for a table for 2, and mind you there are NO reservations there, and there were many tables open at the time. It seemed painful for her to talk to me but she was able to belch out it would be a 30-40 minute wait. We sat at the bar waiting for the 30 minutes at least ( all along by the way, they were seating other groups immediately that were walking in, with no reservations either ) and were finally texted to say our table was ready. I walked over , right after they had just seated another walk in immediately, and she proceeded to tell me that the \"2\" seater tables ARE the bar and she moved us down about 5 seats .... huh???? LOL!!! We left. Very judgmental about class there and if you aren't the \"soul bar\" type and are a party of 2 only.... this is NOT your fit! DO NOT go there."}
{"text":"Interesting place, it's on the second floor of an art gallery that you enter from outside. There's no sign on the door, no advertising. It's a very trendy concept decor wise with some large couch like chairs around small tables. Much of the staff there are very earthy and easygoing, a very young hipster crowd with unique individuals. The best dish was definitely the pork belly tacos with watermelon salsa which were melt in your mouth, super tender and fatty."}
{"text":"Great vibe but you guys already know that. Loved the drinks or at least the husband did. He food was a little bit of hit or miss for us. Here's the things we got.  1. Pork tacos - good but personally I'd like a little more sauce 2. Arugula flat bread - very well done! 3. Chicken skin nachos -  nope didn't work for me. The lady warned us but we decided to give it a try. Not very wise unless chicken skin is your thing 4. Bread pudding - oh my! It's tasted like a brownie but I'm not going to complain.   Here's some additional details from a very vocal pair of neighbors - wings were to die for and the spinach pastry / spanakopita was the best they'd eaten. They couldn't stop oohing and aaing. Haha."}
{"text":"My first time here was not a disappointment. Great atmosphere, awesome food...only thing I didn't really like was the sushi (but I'm a sushi snob). We ordered about 5 different tapas/small plates and all were excellent. I think the blue crab fritters were my favorite...it was a special they had. Would definitely  recommend the Dirty South Nachos. The only other thing I didn't really like was the wine, the Malbec wasn't good, and the Shiraz was so-so.   This is definitely a place I'll go back to try different things in the menu, will probably stay away from the sushi and wine, and stick with tapas and beer. Also will be nice to sit in patio once it gets warmer....great view of the skyline."}
{"text":"I visited Soul Gastrounge twice in the last two weeks and I've gotta say I'm underwhelmed.  The first time I went I was stuffed but friends ordered the veal shortribs, Korean BBQ wings and pork buns.    Short ribs- Not as tender as I would have liked.  The whole point of braising is to get the meat to a point where its fork tender.  This was not the case and it distracted from the overall flavor.    Korean BBQ wings- the outside skin was nice and crunchy but the inside meat was bland and not seasoned.  So anticlimactic.  Pork buns- They were ooook.  The meat to bun ratio could have been kicked up a bit but the flavor was to be expected.  Now, the second time I visited Soul was a hot mess.  I arrived at 7:30 to find that there were no tables available.  I understand that this is commonplace most nights.  I ordered a crunch roll at the bar- I thought this was yellowtail and some tempura flakes or something.  An HOUR later my sushi was done.  Admittedly, it did get pretty crowded in there but come ON.  You dont even have to cook it!  When I asked the bartender where my sushi was his only response was, \"it's coming.\". Well, it came but I don't think it was a crunch roll at all, it was the tempura shrimp roll.  But I ate it anyway, I was starving by that point.   It was also very tasty-which I hate to admit.  So that said, if I go back to Soul Gastrolounge, I will be a) only ordering sushi and b) watching my waiter/waitress/sushi chefs like a hawk so they don't play games with my food."}
{"text":"If you have not yet visited this restaurant you must! It's a great atmosphere and always packed after 6pm because their food is really some of the best you can find when it comes to tapas in Charlotte!  Please do not leave this place without ordering for the Pork Belly Tacos! I don't want to say much about them to hype them up but I can assure you that you will be pleasantly surprised!  They have the best Lamb Lollipops and a great and tasty selection of daily specials. When we stopped in they had the real fresh wasabi which was a nice treat with their sushi. I will definitely be back  to try theri brush on Sunday!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Soul in a while so decided to go recently. Previously have been 4-5 times, the food is going down hill IMHO.  If you are going to call yourself a \"Gastrolounge\" the gastro part better be good, consistent, and well prepared.   Was seated at the bar because there was a 30 min wait, fine. Bartenders were good enough. Ordered pork belly tacos, and flat bread  While waiting for the order, I watch the saute guy eating and touching places he shouldn't while he's was cooking customer's food. Nice ! ... If you work in an open kitchen, you Must be more presentable and conscientious !   I notice the health dept. score, is a 93 ... are you kidding me?   especially in a place that serves raw product.....the report is on line.  The food comes ...  The flat bread was soggy  undercooked, too much topping, and had arugula on it that  should not have been served. Pork belly tacos were good, but nothing spectacular.  We were seated at the table, Collette did a great job ... she gets 4 stars.  Tuna skewer , 1 skewer was well cooked on all sides, rare in the middle, 1 was barely seared on 1 side, and completely raw. The tuna was seriously not fresh.  Beef skewer, not bad, but had to ask for s&p as there was absolutely no seasoning on the meat, the chimichurri was oily and bland.  Korean chicken wings, good flavor and well cooked, but didn't strike me as even slightly \"Korean\"  Soul is very popular but I think but I think the kitchen needs serious help.  Meh, I have experienced better...."}
{"text":"The food was good and surprisingly affordable -- but I'm not convinced it's worth the wait and attitude you have to deal with. Too cramped of a space with too many people that care who's checking them out from the balcony.  Overall, the atmosphere and food is great, but they could step up their game with service and pricing and/or portion sizes. I might go there on a day when I have nothing better to do or if I want to be a bit more fancy, but I don't find myself coming here often."}
{"text":"I went to soul for the first time and thought it was stellar! = )  Our service was decent and the ambiance was nice. The plate portion sizes are perfect for ordering a lot of dishes to try and share. Perfect recipe for a social relaxing meal. Being a lacto-ovo vegitarian I chose the saganaki, wild mushroom toast, and the trio of spreads. All amazing. The mushroom toast with the egg was just... gosh darn fabulous. OHOHOHOHOH! You must try the goat cheese icecream. Big huge mouth orgasm... trust me"}
{"text":"Very good eats and friendly staff- the hipsters holding court there definitely made me feel like I was back in SF."}
{"text":"I went to this place on a late Saturday for a few drinks with a friend. It was my birthday weekend and when we walked in there were two chairs available woohoo. We sat down and ordered drinks and it was served quick.The atmosphere was real chilled, definitely had a soulful cozy vibe, and the DJ play some good music. I'm originally from up north and the vibe that night mentally took me back home.. Only for a second lol. It was cool. The people were nice .. Drinks were on point .. We didn't order food but I will order next time .. This review is subject to change after eating here but honestly it can only go up from here.   Highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Fun environment, great cocktails and the food is amazing! I love how you can order so many different items off the menu and just split it with everyone! It's cool because you can try so many new things. App size servings are great!"}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in charlotte..great atmosphere and great mix of people. Everything that we have ordered on the menu has been amazing. The most amazing fries! Get there early otherwise it's a long wait, but well worth waiting for."}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere, friendly staff but loud and very crowded. Count on a 30 to 60 min wait for a table."}
{"text":"The food is an exploration of southern cuisine without limits! Drinks are as cutting edge as any NYC lounge...with the creative vision of mixologist Andy at the helm you won't be steered wrong. Well worth the wait with a drink in hand."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Every time I go here, they never disappoint!!! My sister and I always order the cupcakes to go!!"}
{"text":"I  frequently enjoyed the food and atmosphere here until I had a very bad experience with the very rude hostess and manager.  There were 10 of us celebrating a birthday and our night was ruined.  We left Soul, went to the Diamond where we had  better service. Soul, quite frankly, lacks \"soul\". The food is good but the unwelcoming, rude staff is a major turn off."}
{"text":"A few things you need to know about SOUL:  1. They do not take reservations, get there early if you can.  2.  It's quite loud in there, but it is after all, a gastro\"lounge\"  3.  It's one of the best culinary experiences in Charlotte.   And... that's all you need to know.  Now, go!!"}
{"text":"Pros:    Food = 5 Stars and is not typical Crowd= wonderful and exciting Noise=Bar setting but more like a unorthodox restaurant/lounge drinks=great and decent price for size  Cons: You have to walk up steps to get there.  That may be a inconvenience to some people."}
{"text":"Pork Belly Tacos are my all time favorite.  yum!  The wait can be longer but it's so worth it...  grab a drink and enjoy the view!"}
{"text":"Ever since discovering Soul, it's always a destination when out-of-town friends are visiting. I think it represents Charlotte really well: eclectic, creative, cozy, and trendy. I don't make it here often enough, mainly because I drop a pretty penny whenever I do visit. It's too easy, because I want it all! Dress up or dress down, go grunge or glam, and you'll fit in. Perfect for an intimate date night during the week or a group of fun friends on a weekend night, if you don't mind standing room and a loud DJ. You will not be disappointed by anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Besides for the service, the food was pretty good. The hummus was tasty, but that's a hard thing to mess up. The lamb lollipops were delicious and the chicken skewers offered up some of the juciest and most flavorful chicken I've had in a while. The dessert menu offered up 3 flavors of cupcakes which were slightly on the dry side. We tried the red velvet and the chocolate, and they were equally as average.  Most importantly, prepare for a lag between the time that you order and the the time you receive your food, even if it's just a little busy. In my opinion, steer clear of a server named Jackie if you want things done right!"}
{"text":"My heart and soul belong here. This place was the reason I moved into Plaza Midwood. The food is creative with surprising combinations of flavors and styles. The drinks are well-crafted and curated for quality. Soul has a quality that can't be imitated anywhere else. The mix is always intriguing with neighborhood hipsters, uptown sophiscates, local yokels, and out-of-towners. It is great to come here with friends,yet intimate enough for a date. It is one of the few places you can come alone and blend with the scene. It gets packed on the weekends so be ready for a wait, but it is fun to people watch in the meantime. My tip is to come earlier in the week because there are great djs every night. I loved my Monday nights with my boyfriend. We enjoyed the soulful spin of the dj and savoured our conversations without the frivolity of weekender distractions. I've since moved out state and miss my Soul."}
{"text":"This place is so much fun to go to!!!  I am in love with the food here!  Also the drinks!  LOL  Though it can get crowded on the weekends and you may have to wait it's worth it.  There is always a great group of poeple that hang out here.  Plus there is live music!  You can't beat that!  Groovin' to some tunes while enjoying awesome food!  I recommend Soul as a definite go to!"}
{"text":"Fantastic spot!  Definitely busy on the weekends, but the atmosphere and staff make every dinner a memorable experience."}
{"text":"The chicken and lamb skewers were really really succulent and tasty. The other things i had were good too. The ambience was pretty lively ( read: noisy ) but it was Friday night so sort of expected it.  The only cons are the long waits and no parking . Paid $5 for a spot a block away :("}
{"text":"Good food but small portions and expensive.  My waiter was really nice.  This is another one of those places that tries really hard and ends up coming off as snooty and mediocre.  It would be a good date place I suppose."}
{"text":"Fabulous interesting food! Service was extremely good and the menu was creative. We had some of everything - appetizer, sushi, soup, skewers and dessert. We are foodies - highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is trendy, but an overall great concept that stands out in Charlotte. All that needs to be said is that the FOOD is Outstanding! Oh..and the bartender concocted amazingly well mixed martinis."}
{"text":"Make sure you get there as soon as they open. There is always a wait, but oh, it is so worth it!! Highly recommend the ahi tuna tacos, pork belly tacos, pan con tomate, and everything else on their menu!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get a slightly dirty dry martini - the bartenders know how to make them! This place becomes crowded on the weekends, but Sunday night is the best time to go! It is intimate and cozy, or if you want the bartenders will chat you up like an old friend. The atmosphere is like you are going to your gorgeous friend's house, you know, the one who has better taste than everyone.   You must try the truffle french fries!"}
{"text":"Very good food!  Great food and a fun place to eat.  Sometimes they have a band or Dj playing.  Great drink specials."}
{"text":"Randomly stopped by with a friend late on a Sunday night. Pleasantly surprised.  DJ was spinning some great tunes & the place was croweded. My friend knew the chef, who sent over a sampling of some Tapas. Very very nice. Staff was friendly & the environment was alot of fun. I've been to Good Food on Montford Dr. & this place is definitely up there with food quality. Look forward to going back again. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Went with my food-loving husband and finicky father... I wouldn't recommend bringing somebody of the simple meat-and-potatoes persuasion, but that's not a slam on Soul by any stretch.   That said, the hubs and I Adore food and I made our way through a good bit of the  menu.  Quick notes:  - The pork belly and watermelon tacos. Are. BALLER.  Seriously, I could eat about a dozen of 'em.   - Ramen - oddly creamy, bland, largely unmemorable but the cheeks were cooked well.  Wouldn't get again. - Marrow - bones were good, parsley salad was Awesome; definitely replicating the latter at home. - Meatballs - kind of dry, but good flavor.  - Flatbread - arugula, truffle-whipped goat cheese, pesto, garlic.  Greasy but very flavorful.  - Crunch Roll  - didn't realize the whole roll was fried, accordingly the fish was cooked through.  Sad face, don't recommend.  - Wings.  Both Korean BBQ and Southern - nothing fancy, but good. - Fries - garlic-herb salt, truffle oil, pecorino, yes!  Giant portion, too.  Service was excellent - Jamie rocked - and though the majority of the food was maybe three-star caliber, the atmosphere, tacos, and friendliness bumped it up to a solid four."}
{"text":"We went here on a Thursday night around 7:15 and did not wait at all to be seated. The crowd was a mix of after workers and locals mostly enjoying cocktails. We decided to eat outside on their heated patio. We started with the cheese plate, and white bean and goat cheese dip, both were very good. We were then bombarded with everything else we ordered, this always irritates me at tapas restaurants because the whole point is to eat slowly, trying and enjoying each new plate. IF your gonna bring it out all at once don't put tapas as your main menu, put app and entree. It was so bad we literally had no room for the last plate on our table. Other than that the tapas was very good. Here are our highlights: the mushroom and egg toast was amazing, curried lamb skewer was also very good, it came with a mango chutney, the fried oysters were also very fresh. I wouldn't recommend the braised veal shank as it was very fatty, the dolmades were just OK, but the hummus that was served as a side was out of this world. I would also avoid the the cupcake, it was very dry. The pistachio ice cream was extremely creamy and had nice pieces of crushed pistachios in it. We will definitely be back to try this place again."}
{"text":"The blonde hostess apparently thought we weren't hip enough and it was clear she didn't like the idea of us \"older folks\" sitting outside just to have a beer while watching the sun set. \"Tables are for people who are having meals.\"  We walked out, and I will never set foot in there again."}
{"text":"Soul is a wonderfully intimate restaurant. Go with the time to enjoy a drink while you wait for a table (super popular place with a bit of a wait) and the ability to enjoy the food without rushing. Soul's menu items compliment each other perfectly."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Soul for the first time last week and I must say, it was the best dining experience we have had in the city, since moving here from California in January. Amazing food, great atmosphere and reasonably priced. I would highly going!!"}
{"text":"This place stays busy and I now know why.  Make sure your entire party is present to be seated.  The food is yummy!  The fried Brussel sprouts, lamb lollipops and goat cheese flatbread were delicious.  The chocolate salted caramel banana filled filo with banana ice cream was amazing!!! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I don't really see what all of the hype is about? We waited two hours to be seated.  I tried several dishes. There was a white dip that came with pita bread - the pita almost broke off a tooth. I ate some of the truffle fries that my friend raved about, and those lacked in flavor as well. I tried three of the sushi rolls. They didn't have a standout flavor. I expected something special based on word of mouth. There was a bone in my roll, so they did not charge me for it. The chocolate bread pudding was delicious and  was the best part of my meal. I would return for the bread pudding and maybe to try some drinks when the place is less busy."}
{"text":"SOOOOOOO Basically I love this place and enjoy coming for not only the fantastic drinks and eats, but the atmosphere, art/soul & general vibe of the joint... not to mention they serve some of the best eats late night in this entire CITAYYYY! Okay enough about how much I actually love this place bc this is ::dun dun dunnnnnhhhh...:: is a negative post bc i had an absolutely terrible **** of a server. I made him wait (my relatively blind date) and we made our server follow us as we moved down 3 whole tables to the corner table to have a little privacy earlier this evening... we must have asked far too much of her. I KNOOOOOOOOW that everyone has a bad day every once in a while and I say this with the deepest concern bc I too have been a server for many years... almost a decade to be exact (although I don't look it) NONE THEE LESS... I don't know her name... this relatively wretched looking, worn down, mousey brunette server with her muffin-top and complete disregard for her looks in general, not matching, no makeup, hair w obviously no effort and potentially unkempt for quite sometime with the rest of her looks... had less then charm, patience, concern or general care of us (i was on a FIRST date  mind you) as patrons. I am being potentially bias and a touch harsh do to upset but honestly she was quite the sight for sore eyes in the joint and I wouldn't give her a gold star for server of the month, I expected more bc everything is normally perfection. The general purpose of the story IS that she was a mediocre and not so visually or otherwise satisfying server...NOT saying she deserved or should have gotten a 10% tip... but she did. In my defense I was on a FIRST DATE!!! We left not keeping her tooo late, I mean the dance music was still bumping and we went to Thomas Street to have a night cap (we did see her there after her shift I'm presuming) then on the walk back to my car as we cross-walked in front of our server in whatever POS she is still struggling to pay off  and she yells from her window \"THANKS FOR THE 10% TIP\"  then peals off and hauls ass. Before her rude display of disdain from an unsavory tip (honey it happens to the best of us) I hadn't a clue... my date was embarrassed (which he should have been, 10% is never acceptable but NOT that she deserved much more...she wasn't an impeccable server by ANY means) I was without words and it was just a sh!t end to an otherwise decent evening. All I'm saying is loud mouth b!tches that don't know when it is appropriate to say something and when it isn't is the ONLY problem if any bc SOUL is an amazing place and the completely uncouth lady (i say that lightly) that served my table didn't deserve the tip she got. I understand a bad night but we weren't even a rude table and sometimes instead of acting like an a-hole you just gotta chock it up to the game, I say it only from experience... cut the fat from the sassy server staff and I would have NO complaint. BASICALLY I wanted to say B!TCH bc I didn't get to before she sped off. Get a filter... Serving is an acting job and you diffidently didn't look or act the part... step it up or find a new profession bc you suck."}
{"text":"Some places just feel comfortably right. Soul Gastrolounge in Charlotte's Plaza Midwood is one of those places. In the funky second floor rectangle that once hosted potty-mouthed comedy shows at The Perch, exposed brick and beams invite diners to settle in for cozy consumption.  Shouldn't all meals be small plates of surprising complementary textures and flavors? A little taste of babaganoush, blue cheese stuffed mini burgers, a wee bite of manchego, some sushi, and skewer of curried lamb with mango chutney is tapas as it is meant to be: plates large enough for sharing or not, and portions that are satisfying and delicious. Daily cupcake specials and house made goat cheese ice cream for dessert round out the menu.   Service is impressive and personal from employees who exude pierced urban cool. When one diner in our party was unsure of which red wine she'd like, the bartender offered tastes of his top three favorites and let her choose the best for her palate from those while our table was readied. Dishes are delivered to tables as their kitchen preparation is completed, and sampling each dish as they arrive is encouraged.  Close quarters are remedied with booths for larger groups, two and four top tables, bar service and couches and chairs at just the right height for coffee table sharing. Outdoor dining is also available on the balcony overlooking the intersection of Central and Pecan Avenues and the Queen City's skyline at this laidback gastronomic retreat."}
{"text":"Very surprised brother took me here, haven't been to this part of town in a long while.  Atmosphere very laid back nice vibe  Food excellent!  Tuna Tacos it works what more can I say  Soul roll not very spicy but very good!  Grilled Caesar very nice  Sushi Fondue also excellent  I will go back and go back soon!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here numerous times before- My husband and I came for our anniversary... As he had never been.  the food has always been good... And because they don't take reservations, we waited to put our name in... While waiting, We overheard the hostess tell the party of 3 in front of us, that it would be about a 5 minute wait.  She went to prepare their table, and came back- we put our name in, and we were told it would be a 45 minute wait... As we watched the party of 3, who came in minutes before us, get sat... We watched 3 other tables, all of which, who arrived at least 30 minutes after us, get sat immediately, at tables that had been empty, the entire time we were waiting. I simply went inside and asked the hostess, why those people were sat immediately/before us, as we saw all of them arrive from the down the street, and she came up with some rude lie... I then explained that I overheard her tell the party of 3 before us, that it would be a 5 minute wait.. And she rudely told me that she never said that... And that we would wait our turn to sit... \"Like everyone else\" needless to say, we didn't make it that far- we left, and had a wonderful dinner elsewhere, at a restaurant with polite staff- that was 10 times more enjoyable. My advice to Soul? Get some employees who are pleasant who greet and take care of your customers correctly, especially ones who know how to articulate themselves to customers politely. Not sure I will be back."}
{"text":"There is definitely a lot of soul in this food!  I had rocky mountain oysters for the first time and they were awesome!  The ambience is unique, the menu is hard to beat and the drinks - YUM!  I forget the name - but I had a drink that was served in a copper mug....WOW!"}
{"text":"Pros: Fantastic food, nice little patio, excellent cocktails, Good service. Charlotte needs more of this vibe.  Cons: if you go on a weekend night, it's CROWDED. Either get there early, or choose another spot to imbibe. Bar seating is first-come first serve and the tables are for diners only.  My suggestion? Go early on a weeknight to avoid the crowds. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pork belly tacos are to die for! Wait took forever and host staff was a little rude, but I'll be back for the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Everything was closed when we arrived at Charlotte so we gave up on the hopes of having a great meal on our first night at Charlotte. But to our surprise, this \"Tapas\" bar/lounge was an absolute surprise. The food here was deliciously a breath of fresh taste buds. Everything on the menu was amazing. I truly recommend the pork belly taco because it was out this world. The vibe of this joint was extremely chill/hip, and the service was exceptional. I can't wait to check this joint out in the near future."}
{"text":"The worst wait ever. Got there at 7. Didn't get seated til 10:30. We were told it  was a 2hr wait. Really?  So beyond disappointed!"}
{"text":"Tapas is not created equal. If you want a trendy ambiance, excellent flavor combinations in small plates, and a bit pricey menu, please try this place. My husband enjoyed the pork belly tacos with watermelon salsa (he does not even like fruit) but was in heaven over the flavor. Also tried the bacon shells and cheese and it was so creamy and delicious. Pita chips with dip trio is very good, and will help you save a little $$ while trying other plates. Delicious! Must try. We will definitely be returning on our next visit to Charlotte."}
{"text":"I've been to Soul at least 4 times in the last year and every time I have gone it's been a bad experience.  It's a cute spot in Plaza so I always try to give it a chance, but the management and staff are terrible.  Management is young with no training and no experience.  Hostesses are so relaxed and do not care about customers.  The bartenders openly make fun of people in the restaurant.  As for the wait, there is always one! I've been twice when the booths have been available but because my group wasn't at least 4 people, they've asked us to wait.  One time we literally waited 45 minutes with no one sitting at two of the booths.   I've been at different times and days and it's always the same.  My last visit we were there at 6:00 pm on a Wednesday with several open tables but none available for two people so they lost our business.   I gave Soul two stars because their food is unique."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place in Charlotte!! I could eat here every day! :) Great atmosphere and food. The lamb lollipops and bone marrow are amazing!!"}
{"text":"We're passing through Charlotte on our honeymoon in July and stopped here. Loved the vibe of this place! It was a Saturday night and the wait was over an hour but they take your number and text you when your table is ready. Super cool so you are t stuck waiting. We explored the area and grabbed a beer while we waited.  We sat outside which was quite cramped.  We ordered a TON of food! Trio of dips, sushi, pork tacos, flatbreads....there was more. Everything was good, nothing I haven't had though. Fun place. Cool location. Great for a fun date night."}
{"text":"So so delicious. Does not open until 5, but people are lined up out the door to eat there. There is a nice bar area, a nice booth seating area, and true couches/lounge area. Amazing service, amazing food. Also - don't be afraid to try their sushi. So good! Their pork belly tacos are also unexpectedly delicious. All over great restaurant - but not very big. Plan on a long wait or making reservations, and it may not be the best choice for a big party."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Goat cheese is off the hook. We don't get here often enough but when we do it is worth it. Brussels and pork belly tacos are not to be missed."}
{"text":"After a number of friends recommended Soul, I decided to give it a try. Atmosphere is good, especially if you're lucky enough to sit inside at one of the \"living room\"-like areas. We sat outside, but no problems there -- the weather was great and the view of the city was nice.   Service was below average. Sure, it was busy, but that's not my problem, is it? Our waitress seemed exasperated when we asked questions about the menu -- to the point that on her first engagement with us she simply walked away when it was apparent we didn't know what we wanted yet. I would have left at that moment, but I didn't want to ruin the evening for everyone else.   On to the food:   They should either remove the sushi from the menu or hire someone that knows how to make it. We had yellowtail with scallions and hamachi with jalepenos. Both were unremarkable, bland and the plating was just wrong.   The white bean and goat cheese dip was mainly white beans (did they even put any goat cheese in it?). Bland, boring and criminal given that it was unseasoned and lacking goat cheese. I can open a can of white beans at home and won't forget to doctor it up so at least it tastes somewhat interesting.   Anchovy fries were OK. Saganaki -- same. Mediterranean wings were nicely done. The lone excellent dish was the fried oysters -- lightly battered, delicately fried and juicy inside.   My main advice to the operators of Soul would be to hire waiters that can handle stress and that at least try to pretend they like their customers. Good, personable service can cure a lot of ills."}
{"text":"The hype is real... the food is amazing. You have to get the pork belly tacos and after that it's your call but you won't be disappointed. I would suggest going before 7pm and trying to sit at the bar. I was able to get a seat right away. I didn't have any cocktails but they looked awesome as well."}
{"text":"I've been to soul for dinner and enjoyed it, even after the hour + wait to get in the door, but after having brunch there today, I will never venture anywhere else (except Zada Jane's) for Sunday brunch! Wow! Awesome flavors! Awesome service! Less of a wait than other popular brunch places! The spinach feta pita=amazing! Truffle fries=f*#k McDonald's fries forever-slap your mama-holy lawd-delicious! The potato hash (sans sausage of course)=rich and tasty! Great mint Julip with fresh muddled mint, and good bloody Mary. Only gripe= they need MORE VEGETARIAN options (some TOFU and \"SOY\"SAGE would be lovely; they have both across the street at Zada Jane's...another great brunch place) and they need to offer a VEGAN BLOODY MARY (with vegan or no Worcestershire)."}
{"text":"Star knocked off for wait times. Unfortunately can't reserve ahead of time so ah well.  Regardless,  the food is pretty good. Ordered the tzatziki dip, fries, and Korean BBQ wings. All food was delicious! They came out as they were ready, so nothing was too cold when it got here. One complaint some may make is the pita bread/chips are a little harder than they should be. Ask for extra napkins when you eat the wings!"}
{"text":"Tapas were good, not amazing but worth the money. The pork belly nachos were the best part of the meal. The beer selection is lacking, especially since they are a mile away from a brewery that has 10+ beers. I'll come back again. Service was great!"}
{"text":"Good food-great sushi-amazing drinks. Why not five stars??? The staff is rude---and not very attentive. We had to ask 3 times for water, and unless you have extreme tattoos and gauges in your ears, don't expect to see a smile come your way. Bartenders are the best chance of a pleasant employee interaction."}
{"text":"Literally my favorite restaurant I've ever been to. Phenomenal food, excellent service, great bar. I've had probably 12 different things off the menu and all but 1 have been stellar. Even the 1 that wasn't stellar was pretty good. The servers are all wonderful. Very accommodating, happy to chit chat if you like, or be all business. I will say, if you don't like tattoos and piercings on your waitstaff, probably not the place for you. Me? I don't care. The house mixologist is excellent. His take on a moscow mule is the best I've ever had. Its so good that they keep it on draft! Its one of three restaurants in Charlotte to which I consistently return.   Side note: the sushi is amazing.  Finally, be forewarned: If you go on the weekend you WILL wait two hours to be seated. Its worth it."}
{"text":"So my friend and I checked out Soul Gastrolounge for the first time last night. As the other Yelp reviewers confirmed, there was at least an hour and a half wait - but they take your phone number and text you when your table is ready, which is super convenient if you want to bar hop in the area while you wait.    We only ended up waiting an hour and were seated. We ended up ordering the pork belly tacos, truffle fries, Korean BBQ wings, avocado stack salad, and a sushi roll. Each portion is small and comes out when it is ready.   The pork belly tacos were everything that the previous reviews said they were gonna be - AMAZING. The watermelon added a nice tang to the saltiness of the pork.   The truffle fries were amazing as well. Hot and crispy and seasoned to perfection as any good fry should be.   The avocado stack salad was literally amazing and life changing and everything a avocado loving person like myself would dream of.   The Korean BBQ wings were ok. I'm a fan of spicy food, but this seemed like someone just poured a whole bottle of hot sauce into a bowl, added a dash of Korean seasonings and tossed the wings in there. Wouldn't order again.   The sushi roll was good. I believe it was called the Geisha roll. Could be wrong.   Definitely would come back here, but probably during a weekday when it might not be so busy, in comparison to a Friday or Saturday."}
{"text":"First off let me say that the atmosphere is what we went for. I love the exposed brick, low lighting and relaxed seating. It does get a bit noisy around the bar, so if you are looking for something more private get a booth. We were able to grab one of the couches and people watch while enjoying the food. One down side is they do not take reservations so get there early. Luckily, I knew this and we showed up around 6:30 and were one of the last to be seated right away and ended up staying until around 9. This is a tapas bar so you never really know how long people will stay.  Now...onto the food... Which was amazing! The tuna tacos were great, I would have liked them in a soft taco instead of a hard shell, but that is just personal preference. I found myself with sauce all over my fingers after one bite. The white bean and goat cheese dip was just ok, I tasted more bean than cheese though. We had an amazing flatbread that was on special that evening which was the highlight for me. New potatoes, corn, cheese and pesto... Mmmmm! Something I have learned is ALWAYS ASK FOR THE SPECIALS!   The drink prices were right on target and not overpriced. The service was on point before our server was sat several times with one table being a party of 12. Tatyana still checked on us often and kept our water glasses filled.   Minus one star for not being able to make reservations or call ahead seating. We do not live close to the city, so showing up and not being able to get in when we want would be disappointing.  Overall a great experience. We will be going back!"}
{"text":"Very good spot food was awesome drinks were good service was great the food and the presentation were excellent!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Food was excellent! We enjoyed every bite. Definitely the place to go if you're in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I went here first for a girls night out. I must say, I love the hipster atmosphere with the worn but comfy couches surrounding a coffee table. That was the perfect way to wind down on a Friday evening. I didn't even realize I like cucumber infused water until I came here. We ordered several dishes to split - lamb lollipops, sticky veal short ribs, fried brussel sprouts, spanakopita, fried meatballs, pork belly tacos and the truffle fries. There is not one item that didn't blow my taste buds out the box! The only thing I would change is the tzatziki sauce. It was not nearly \"Greek\" enough for me :)  My advice is to get here early, or you'll never sit. And bring lots of people and order everything and share! One of my best girls' nights for sure."}
{"text":"After having reservations (which they don't take until you show up at their restaurant) and waiting for 2 hours we had to leave and go eat somewhere else because it was going to be another 45 minutes. I have no idea if this place is worth a crap but unless you have 3 hours to wait for dinner do NOT GO HERE on a weekend night!  TH said Bistro la Bon was amazing, fantastic food, spectacular service, great vibe. We will be back"}
{"text":"First time I went to this place and loved it! I hear it is typically very busy and has a long wait but we went and were sat immediately.  The flatbread: AMAZING! I didn't want it to end. And the atmosphere was very cool and chill. Definitely a trendy spot but very enjoyable."}
{"text":"We had been wanting to try Soul and finally made a visit for brunch. It was a pleasant experience all around and we're looking forward to trying the full dinner menu. The food was fresh and tasty, the drinks were mixed well, and the service was just right. Marlon was our server and he did a great job of balancing info and full glasses without overpowering. It was refreshing! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food. LOVE the pork tacos. Wish the place was a little larger and didn't always have such a long wait."}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite restaurant in Charlotte, but it's more bar bites than true tapas. Don't expect to just walk in and get a seat - it's not uncommon for the wait to be hourS (yes, plural)! Pro tip though, download the NoWait app and get a place in line without having to physically walk in. Then just head up about 15 minutes before the expected seating time to get a drink. Be sure to keep your phone closeby because sometimes you're up earlier than expected and you only have 10 minutes to claim your table. Cocktails are good, but don't expect a hefty pour. I get the pork belly tacos every time! Flatbread and the duck are also delish. Skip the sushi, there are better places to get sushi in town."}
{"text":"3 words: Pork Belly Tacos!!!! With the watermelon? Oh. My. Gosh. A must and enough reason to go to Soul (even if it's your only). Although the fried goat cheese on bruschetta is pretty darn good, too."}
{"text":"My favorite spot in town for a group dinner. But you need to go right at opening time or prepare for a 1-2-hour wait (they don't take call-ahead or reservations and it's a small place). Best size group for your money/eating is 4-5 people. Get about 10-11 small plates/sides and split them all. Such a fun way to eat. Portions are small but you'll get to try a ton of things! Top three must-have's are the ASIAN GLAZED PORK BELLY TACOS (only comes with 3 though, so get 2 orders because you will want MORE), the garlic herb fries, and the curried lamb skewers with mango chutney. NOM."}
{"text":"The \"Soul Roll\" is just sums it up for this place! The sushi is amazing and the Soul Roll is the best dang roll on the planet. The atmosphere is conversational and small. The hostess's are bitches and I am not a fan of them when I enter the door, but its worth a passing to sit there and eat their amazing food! I've had just about everything on their menu and I love how they have mini plates, so you can have a variety of food at once. Great place to bring a date, have a glass wine or even a cocktail, and hang out with friends. I probably go at least once a week, but the place is very small for such a fantastic food and drinks. Not recommended for huge parties because your food will take forever! I went the other night with 5 people and it took forever to sit, the hostess was a bitch to us because we had 5 people, and our food came out in spurts so we never got to eat all at the same time. One recommendation for Soul is get better hostess's and make your place bigger for dining. Your food is way to good not too! I gave you 4 stars because of my past experience with having a bigger group and the fact that every time I go in their your hostess's are rude, bitchy, and straight up not friendly."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow! There aren't many places that could have made an 8 hour layover from Phoenix  to a long awaited vacation enjoyable... But this place sure nailed it. We went on a Wednesday night, waiter told us there can be a 3-4 hour wait on the weekends. Food, drinks, & service were great."}
{"text":"Seriously great place. Love trying new things and sharing?  Then this place is for you!  Vibe is a little hipster so I stand out like a sore thumb but who cares with such good food!  We tried about 8 different things but the chimichurri beef, dirty south nachos, and queen Charlotte roll stood out!  Great place to bring out of town guests!"}
{"text":"Super high quality food. Went here for a birthday dinner and ordered 6-7 different tapas between a friend and I. Had chimichurri beef, Asian pork belly tacos, saganaki, bone marrow, and veal short ribs. One of the tastiest meals I have had easily. Great lightning inside, I would go here just for drinks."}
{"text":"Hands down, one of my favorite places in Charlotte! Their bartenders and servers are the best and the food is allllways tasty! I've loved everything I've ever tried, even things that I had no intention of loving (I'm looking at you, Pork Belly Tacos!).   It can be a bit loud during peak dinner hours but I'm usually digging the tunes so that's never an issue for me. I take all my out of town visitors here for dinner and/or brunch."}
{"text":"I made my second visit to Soul and was just as pleased this time as the first. The service was great. I love the fries and sushi. Looking forward to the next visit."}
{"text":"Soul was literally my first stop after landing in Charlotte (thankful it's open late night,) and it was even better than I remembered. My friends and I ordered a variety of cocktails; all were creative and delicious (I liked the spicy moscow mule the best.) I ordered the truffle fries (to die for,) a california roll (good, but nothing extraordinary) and pan con tamale (new addition the menu, and absolutely delicious.) Even though it was nearly midnight, the server never rushed us and willingly separated our checks (which I know is a nuisance.) Thanks, Soul, for a lovely evening back in Charlotte! I literally would come to town just to be able to eat here."}
{"text":"Such a great experience and the food was delicious!  We ordered numerous dishes. The garlic fries are to die for! The garlic flavor was perfect just to my liking. The pork belly tacos were a tad too salty for me but the watermelon really toned the saltiness down and was a great compliment to the pork belly. We also enjoyed the ramen bowl, different but delicious. Another great dish was the nachos, fried chicken skin with pimento cheese. I never had anything like that before, it was definitely worth all the calories.  Washed everything down with the cucumber water that they provide which was the perfect closure to the night."}
{"text":"Yummy food and really cool vibe! Loved the sashimi tuna tacos, flatbread and brussel sprouts! Our server Alex was EXCELLENT! She knew the menu very well and was extremely patient while trying to accommodate our friends buttery Chardonnay request! Can't wait to go back! But it would have been nice to have more Chardonnay options by the glass"}
{"text":"First review in Yelp gives to Soul Gastrolounge, hands down one of my favourite places in NC. I had the dinner this August and the pork belly bun still impresses me. They have a lot of specialities on the menu, just be adventurous. Nice place for a date, but the place can get quite busy for its popularity."}
{"text":"I have lived in Charlotte for almost 6 years now, and I have to say I sincerely love this establishment. I don't care how long we have to wait to get a table, the food is very much worth the wait every time. I understand the restaurant is relatively small, so wait times will be lengthy  on a Fri, Sat and Sunday night. My main recommendations are the Lamb Lollipops, Hummus platter, and the Truffle fries. OMFG!!! But seriously, the whole menu is quite wonderful. A must try."}
{"text":"This city needs some more places like this. Small, simple, good. Crazy mixed up menu that works in its own weird way. Sushi with a greek influenced menu? Two of my favorite things. WHY NOT? Came her with the lady friend on a Wednesday night. Wanted to sit on the bar and have a bottle of wine and relax. Host told us that patio was only for dining guests... odd but okay. Bellied up to the bar. Sat for about 5 minutes or more before a bartender even recognized we were there. Grabbed a bottle and the dip trio plate. PERFECT. Bartender brought us a sample of one of their specialty drinks as well as a sample of some Soju. Def made up for the small blunter. Finally after the kitchen closed we were able to grab a seat outside. Ended up being a great night. Only regret is that I did not get the Shrimp Ceviche and Spicy Feta.... next time."}
{"text":"I moved to Charlotte about 6 months ago and have not wasted a second to try all of the fantastic restaurants offered in this unsuspecting town.  After a few wonderful experiences and some mediocre, I finally made it to SOUL.  I had only heard great things about it other than the fact that they dont take reservations & don't seat until the entire party is there.  This was not that big of a deal, when you see how tiny the place is inside.    My first experience was great and I could not wait to go back when my boyfriend was in town.  We didn't want to wait for a table so we sat at the bar.  We had \"Bob the Bartender\" and couldn't have asked for a better server.  We told him we wanted him to basically do a tasting menu but to keep it under $100.  He not only made us FANTASTIC drinks but each dish he served us paired well with each cocktail. I had the cucumber martini that he prepared old school style by pouring the liquor into the glass from above his head.  He served us wonderful tapas including the Dancing Tuna roll, Fried egg Mushroom toast, hamachi jalapeno sashimi, ahi tuna tacos, pork belly w/ watermelon, etc. For dessert he made us the most delicious Chocolate Martini; I had the goat cheese icecream and my bf had the pistachio.  Both delectable.  I cannot say enough great things about this place, the food & service are amazing and it has been a regular stomping ground for me in Charlotte.  Bravo Soul!"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant.  I was sooo looking forward to my meal here, but over two hours later and a $120 bar tab, our party was never seated. When confronting the front staff they said \"There's no competition, this is Charlotte\" basically showed us the attitude.  I will never give this place my business, Make your money while you can, because people will only put up with this shit for so long. Learn to turn your tables."}
{"text":"I have relied on yelp for years, but I have never written a review. Tonight's meal is worthy of a review! The pork belly tacos and lamb lollipops are DELICIOUS. We will order 2-3 plates of tacos next time. The winter mules are also excellent...very ginger-y but it worked. The hostess and wait staff were friendly enough. :) Our water glasses were never empty and the food was served promptly. If you arrive just before they open, there is little to no wait."}
{"text":"This place had decent food, but overall I found it not worth the high price tag. If you're a tapas person and are looking for a cool place to hang out and try a couple different things, it's great! You can find stuff here that's not served anywhere else."}
{"text":"My wife decided to take me here after she went with a couple of her friends.  She thought that I would love their fries.  Which, I do.  The atmosphere is fun and lively.  I have not been when there is loud music playing so I cannot comment on that as I have heard that they do.    My favorite is the Napoleon roll.  I am not a fan of sushi at all and I love this one.  In fact, I go to Soul just for their Napoleon roll.    If you are looking for a casual place to hang out and have a good time I suggest trying Soul.  I feel that it is a place you will either love or hate.  I personally enjoy it.  The service that we had was great one time and then poor the second time.  Granted, this is true of most places you go to."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Porkbell tacos are amazing! Only bad thing is the seating abs the wait. But it's totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Great atmosphere! What more could you ask for? The menu is unique but not too eclectic. They're tapas which is nice. The fried goat cheese bruschetta is delicious. Same with the oysters. It's a popular place, so expect a wait on the weekends. However, they'll text you when your table is ready. So you can enjoy a drink at the bar or wander around the area. Overall, good spot to check out!"}
{"text":"Got reservations an hour early.  They seated us 15 mins late.  The food was tiny and overpriced.  Quality a 3* and price a 4*.  They brought out the plates one at a time 5 minutes a part.  An hour after we ordered, after delivering everyone else's food, they finally told the last member of our crew that they were out of his order.  Everyone else was nearly finished with their meal at this point.  The foods a 3 and the experience was a 0."}
{"text":"We went this past Saturday for some drinks. Loved the atmosphere and the service was great. We also ordered the flatbread, tuna tacos, and fries to snack on.  LOVED the tuna tacos!  Overall, we really enjoyed the food and drinks. I didn't really like the mule (way too heavy on the cucumber flavor) but otherwise everything was great."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Very hip crowd, fits in perfectly with the Plaza Midwood area. Artistry and very laid back. Reminds me of a DC handout I went to. The best sushi in town. Small restaurant and bar, perfect for a outing with a small group of friends. I would not suggest bring kids, this is more of a adults only restaurant. SOUL Rolls are the best. YUM"}
{"text":"Whenever my wife and I feel like doing something lounge-esque but don't feel like dealing with the douchebaggery (from both men and women) that passes for the norm at bars and clubs on Tryon Street, we'll venture to Soul Gastrolounge for good food, stiff cocktails, and some well-chosen chillout music.   Soul Gastrolounge, thankfully, is devoid of the bling-ridden, obnoxious pretension that soulless dead ends like Cosmos Cafe is so guilty of. Here, you'll find a mix of urban professionals, hipsters, regular joes, all walks, so to speak. You won't be made to feel out of place here. The staff, from the hostess to the waitstaff, are very friendly; the waiter who served us the last time around offered a few suggestions that were first-rate, and he did so with cheerful aplomb. Did I just use the word \"aplomb?\" Of course, expect crowds on a Friday or Saturday night, but if you time it just right, you can get a table right after 9pm or so, when patrons fool enough to go hit the bars and clubs on Tryon vacate their tables. Suckas.  I love the vibe here. Dimly lit, but not dark, the music loud enough but not deafening, and, yeah, it's crowded on Friday and Saturday nights, but you never get the feel that you've got someone brushing up against you. Unless you like having someone brush up against you. Whatever works, son.  The food itself is the attraction for me. Soul Gastrolounge takes its culinary cue from the classic tapas bar set-up; you're hungry, but you don't want a big meal, you want something you and your party can pick on and share together. There's definitely much on the menu in terms of appetizers and tapas to choose from. The sushi is also quite spectacular, surprising for a non-sushi restaurant.  I particularly enjoy eating and drinking on the balcony. At night, you're blessed with an uncluttered view of uptown Charlotte. The balcony's a bit crowded, since it's quite narrow, but the view's pretty nice, plus, if you're lucky, you'll get to see the freight train come across the heart of Central Avenue.  Honestly, I'd eat at Soul Gastrolounge any time, even when we're not feeling lounge-y. This is one of my favorite places to eat in town."}
{"text":"Great spot. Wait for a table can be very long on weekends. The pork belly watermelon tacos, lamb pops, and meatballs were all awesome. The duck banh mi left something to be desired, but was still very edible. Generally had a cool vibe."}
{"text":"Very close to my house. One of my favorite spots in Charlotte. Very hip and trendy. Loud. Very helpful serves. Menu is very big and slightly complicated. Every item you order will be FABULOUS.  What to get: Ahi Tuna Skewers Pork Belly Tacos ***** Brussel Sprouts Salmon and basically everything  They don't take reservations and there is always, always a wait, so that is one drawback. But you can give them your cell number and go to Peculiar Rabbit for a drink while you wait for them to text you."}
{"text":"The only good things about this place are the atmosphere and the bartenders. They've got some cool, friendly bartenders. My food is always wrong, undercooked, or incredibly slow. How does that happen every time?"}
{"text":"Soul is our absolute favorite place for dinner and/or drinks in Charlotte! We have tried so many things on the menu and have not yet been disappointed. All of their sushi rolls are delicious and I love that their cocktail menu changes seasonally."}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE place in Charlotte!!! I used to live a few blocks away and went at least once a week. They have everything!!! It's a good place to take a group bc everyone can find something they like! Five stars for sure!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A great variety of food in a chill atmosphere. The service was cool and attentive. Underneath the place now is a hipster art gallery/bar that I wish I had spent more time in. I will go again."}
{"text":"We checked out Soul Gastrolounge a couple years ago and for some reason... we didn't really like it. Despite our lack luster experience the place has always remained one of Charlotte's most popular restaurants. While hanging out with some friends they suggested we check out Soul again and we reluctantly agreed. Thank God we did... Soul rocks!  We must have either ordered the wrong stuff or caught them on an off night the first time because this second look at Soul Gastrolounge left us wanting more, and more, and way more. Since we were able to go as a group and split the plates we ended up ordering a lot more than if we had gone alone. We tried the:  Garlic Shrimp Chimichurri Beef Dirty South Nachos Sticky Veal Shortribs Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos Pan Con Tomate Soul Korean BBQ Wings Wild Mushrooms on Toast Ahi Tuna with Sesame & Soy Drizzle Duck Bahn Fi Sandwich  All of which was delicious and worth recommending but for me the star of the show was easily the pork belly tacos :)"}
{"text":"The pork belly tacos are my favorite plate in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"The absolute best food in a log time- shells and cheese ranks up there with the Red Dragon Roll and then finish off with Spanakopita (perfect film dough and spinach). The best drink with all the above was the cucumber mule!!!"}
{"text":"Hip atmosphere, eclectic mix of food. I had the cubanini and it was satisfying.  I want to try the sushi next time."}
{"text":"I love this place, the food, drinks and atmosphere are all tens...my only issue is the music is too loud. Soul is such a chill place to lounge, but the music makes me want to leave because I can barely hear the people I'm spending time with"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Great menu and really cool vibe inside. From out of town but in Charlotte often and will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"My husband just politely told me to update my Soul review, mainly due to 1 fact that has changed. The cocktails.  In my last review, I recommended not to get cocktails here. Since that point, my viewpoint has changed 180 degrees. Soul cocktail menu is very diverse and changes with the seasons. The bartenders use innovative techniques to create these pieces of art. Every single cocktail I have gotten has been totally delicious!!!  My opinion on the food has not changed. Everything is perfection. Pork belly tacos. Truffle fries. Ramen bowl. Pork belly stuffed shells. Some of my favs! We always end the night with a sushi roll (usually do the roll of the day) as a way to round out our fullness without spending a ton of money!!  Soul continues to be my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. We typically only go about once a year just to keep it special."}
{"text":"Cool happy hour atmosphere problem is it is always insanely slammed.  I probably wouldn't try to get in with out reservations (and expect service to be a little slow)."}
{"text":"Came here on a late night date during the week, hoping their kitchen was still open, I was pleasantly surprised to see they served food until 2am!   Small plates, BIG taste! Their fusion of Greek, Spanish, Asian and American cuisine is always a reason I keep coming back. I find myself ordering half of the menu just to try everything I possibly can! The stuffed piquillo peppers and goat cheese is one of my favorites as well as the Hummus.   The ambiance is perfect for a late night date, or a chill gathering to enjoy smooth house music and good company. With a choice between tables, outdoor seating or couches, this place provides the setting for a very good night."}
{"text":"My favorite small plates restaurant in Charlotte. Service never disappoints and neither does the food. Definitely try the pork belly tacos and their ramen bowl (honestly, everything on the menu). Their sushi is also phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I live in the area and tend to try and make it several times a year if I can. If the pricing was a little better, I might be able to attend more but can't fit it in my budget as frequently as I'd like.  I recently took my cousin and her fianc√© as they were visiting from Poland and they both enjoyed their experience (probably him more than her).  We each started with a drink, my cousin and I got the Ros√©, and he got a scotch on the rocks. The waiter mixed up orders and brought two scotch on the rocks but that wasn't a hard fix :). They offer cucumber water so if you want plain, be sure to let your waiter/waitress know. It's very refreshing and light, and I enjoy that little difference they offer. Who isn't bored of regular water with a lemon anyways??  It's a tapas style restaurant so we shared the stuffed piquillo peppers, garlic fries, tuna tacos, and bone marrow. I haven't had a bad experience with Soul's food and that's a reason I keep coming back.  The last couple times I've been a bit disappointed that my bone marrow bone was very small and in turn, yielded very little bone marrow to enjoy. Luckily this time I had a nice, deep bone and all three of us were able to enjoy it. The texture is a little slimy and bulky, sometimes salty but it melts in your mouth...don't forget to add it on top the provided grilled bread, so delicious. Tuna tacos never fail either. They're marinated, diced tuna in fried wonton tacos (thin and light), with marinated cucumbers and sriracha mayo (not spicy).  The fries are garlic-herb salted, dusted with pecorino & truffle oil are always necessary to get. They are thin (almost McDonalds looking), and not greasy so you don't feel too bad eating them. Trust me, try them if you haven't. The herb cheese stuffed piquillo peppers on bruschetta are sooo good. The cheese is light, not heavy feeling and compliments being stuff inside the pepper. They come out warm on the bruschetta so I'd recommend eating them when they arrive. No worries if it cools a little because they're still delicious. My cousin and her fianc√© had a lamb gyro and enjoyed it. It was a reasonable size as they were able to split it between them.  Overall this experience went well. It was later at night when we arrived so there wasn't a wait (about 10pm), but if you're looking to go closer to the weekend you could be waiting for hours. Prior to this visit I utilized the \"no wait\" app and I'd suggest doing the same as well because once everyone gets out of work, or its dinner time on the weekend, the place will fill up real quick. Very quickly. I mentioned living close by so the \"no wait\" app works perfectly. (No joke) about 1.5-2.5 hrs before I know we want to go to dinner, I put our name on he list and just wait. An hour prior to their guesstimated time I will start getting ready and once we're the next to be seated we start walking over. I once put our name on the no wait app a little late (630-7pm?) and were given such a late time that we opted to go somewhere else. We forgot to take our name off the list and we're finally messaged around 1130 that a table was ready. We've already eaten elsewhere and made it uptown by that point so no need to make it over. Needless to say, do some research and utilize the no wait app if Soul is still affiliated with it. Otherwise you may not get to eat at a reasonable hour unless you score a seat at the bar which is first come first serve. Or, you may like the Parisian eating schedule, and all I'd have to say is \"enjoy\" :).   Great place, amazing and different food, great vibe with upbeat music... try to make a stop in if you're in from out of town. Your guests shouldn't be disappointed... unless they like the normal burger and fries or shrimp scampi and don't like trying new things."}
{"text":"Consistently good. We have eaten there a bunch and we keep finding new things we love."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say I'm a hipster, but I love Soul.   Luckily we live in the 'hood and can slip into this place on early evenings or afternoons when it's not slam packed.   I've not had anything bad here.  Sushi is wonderful and love the option of ordering several tapas plates to share.  Cupcakes for dessert - yum!  The decor is posh but the interior is small and can be very tight at times.  Always had good service here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Their pork belly tacos and lamb chop lollipops are to die for. I could get them all day! Just writing this review is making my mouth water"}
{"text":"I have only one complaint. This place is popular - people know about their daily drink specials, their eclectic menu, and friendly service, full of suggestions and refills... and being that I wait tables myself, I am hardpressed not to leave the moment I've finished my meal and the place starts filling up. I'd LIKE to sit and stay for several more drinks but my inner-server tugs on my sleeve, telling me to get goin' and let the people make their money (not THEIR servers, though.)   Where do I start? Went with my boyfriend and roommate one Monday, arrived fairly early, around 6pm, and the server told us about the specials and I ended up grabbing their flatbread special after I heard the words \"crab\" and \"arugula.\" I LOVED THIS DISH. The crab/arugula/lemon vinaigrette/candied garlic combo is genius, I could eat it out of a tub. It would be just as good as a salad, with more arugula, of course.   My roommate, who isn't altogether very picky or adventurous, ordered the sliders and cleaned his plate. My boyfriend and I shared the hamachi and jalapeno, which is super fresh, has a pretty presentation, and the accompanying sauce is right on point for the fish.   I drank their sparkling sake, sparking rose, and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, the boys had Newcastles, and we were satisfied overall with their selection. I might have ordered beer if their selection was better. I could use some more microbrews, seasonal stuff, etc. The sake is ok, the rose is good, and the Sauvignon Blanc was good. Nothing to write home about. I sampled the new Greek wine they hadn't put on the menu after ordering an Assyrtiko blend that was on the menu, but it wasn't for me, and the server graciously agreed that she may not have wanted an entire glass of it, either. Makes you more comfortable when a server agrees with your dislike of something, so I appreciated it.   I love the warm ambiance, the coziness, and though I've only been there once, I could tell that many others love this place, too. It's moderately priced (well, pretty cheap, actually, if you're used to eating out fairly regularly,) and the three of us spent $80 (tip not included) on snacks and bunches of drinks, including a couple glasses of wine and a small-ish bottle of sake ($12.)    Definitely close to 5 stars for what it is -- a cool little gastropub."}
{"text":"1 star due to the HORRIBLE attitude of the manager. Decided to sit outside tonight because there was a 45 min wait for an inside table. After being seated and seeing it was pretty cold, we asked the manager to turn the heaters on. He told us that there was no way he would turn the heaters on with it being 65 degrees. Too bad it was actually 55 degrees and he was a total ass in his approach to our request. I've been coming to this place for years but seriously doubt I will be back anytime soon with how management wants to treat customers!"}
{"text":"all I wanted was a simple steak and egg sandwich.   the waitress mentioned the egg would be sunny side up. having had unpleasant issues with a runny egg recently, I asked for the egg to be scrambled. she obliges and put my order in.  5 minutes pass and the waitress comes back to the table to let me know the chef REFUSES to scramble the egg. the choices: sunny or fried hard. why couldn't he just scramble it? she said she asked him the same thing and they got into it. i sullenly agree to \"fried hard\" -- whatever that means.  plate finally makes it to the table. dried ass tired looking egg on top of unseasoned \"steak\" with a butter soaked piece of toast underneath. gee, thanks.  honestly what I requested wasn't a substitution (the menu doesn't state sunny side up)... all you had to do was shake the damn fork or spatula around in the egg.  i was so displeased, i couldn't really enjoy my meal. the waitress was very nice but otherwise..."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute gem of Charlotte. Great, relaxed atmosphere with some superb food. The sushi at this place is the best I have had in Charlotte. The staff were incredibly helpful and went out of their way to make sure that we enjoyed the food. The food is served in a tapas-style layout. There wasn't anything on the menu we didn't like. I will definitely be going back to this place ASAP."}
{"text":"Love love this place.  I have come twice now and I could live on the pork belly tacos alone.  Other standouts are the lamb lollipops and the hamachi jalape√±o plate.  The only thing I don't like is that they don't take reservations - get there early or use the wait in line app.  Also, if you are seated outside it smells slightly of mildew.  I think it's from the plastic curtains that shield the patio from the wind.  They probably get a bit damp post-rain."}
{"text":"Soul Gastrolounge can get really busy - so expect to wait outside or on the stairs for a table.  Because of the exciting choices on the menu, I was pumped to try out this place.  Armed with a Corporate card and a coworker, we arrived at Soul on a Wednesday evening and hardly had to wait.  We both got a table outside, which was actually really nice on an early fall evening.  Service was great - our server was very nice and our plates were cleared quickly and waters always full.    For food, we ordered the following:  Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos - ain't nothin' \"Asian-glazed\" about these tacos... unless something like five spice qualifies as \"Asian\".  However, these were my favorite out of the bunch we ordered.  The pork belly was nicely cooked, really flavorful with the \"Asian Glaze\" and the watermelon salsa (really just marinated watermelon) added a nice flavor to the bite as a whole.  I would probably rather have this without the tortilla.  Ramen bowl - very large serving!  The first 5 bites of this was really good, but then it just really became way too salty.  The ramen noodles were nice and chewy and reminded me of the kind that comes in American instant ramen (Top Ramen).  What really stood out here were the veal cheeks that basically melted in your mouth and the amazing goat cheese fried mushrooms.  YUM.  Bone marrow - pass.  This hardly tasted like anything and was basically a ton of butter on some crostini.  Flatbread - truffle whipped goat cheese, pistachio pesto, honey braised garlic and fresh arugula - actually quite tasty, but hard to eat.  It was very soggy, but had really good flavor from the mix of ingredients.  Korean BBQ wings - I live in NYC... where Korean chicken wings are a real thing and really delicious.... unfortunately these do not compare.  Chicken wings need to be more crispy, in my opinion.  For dessert, we got the banana chocolate phyllo turnovers - such a good decision and at $5, it was very reasonably priced.  However the star of this show was the banana pudding ice cream - SO GOOD.  Too bad they don't sell it by itself.  I'm not really sure what to call this place... like an American/Asian \"fusion\" or what, but it's a decent place for drinks and tapas with a good environment.  I'm pretty picky when it comes to food, only because I've had far better in NYC.  Bottom line - decent food, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is cool.  The food is awesome and the prices are very reasonable. The drinks are equally reasonable and good.  The atmosphere is pretty cool but a bit cramped. Getting a table or place to sit can be a challenge.   Over all its a good value for your $ and its a fun place just to chill and grab a late night meal."}
{"text":"Always a culinary adventure and cool vibe. Plan on a wait, drinks at the bar or on the patio, and then indulge in inventive and yummy tapas. Pork belly tacos and sushi rolls rule."}
{"text":"The significant other and I just happened to stroll into this place and managed to get a seat at the bar despite there being an hour wait for any table.  The bartender (long hair and tattoos) was an excellent host and made all sorts of recommendations for things to try as well as places to check out in the city. What was supposed to be 2 tapas turned into about 4 or 5 over the next 2 hours and several drinks, all of which were outstanding.   The pork belly tacos were the stand out item but everything was amazing. The atmosphere is very chic and upscale, which I should have looked up in advance since I came in wearing jeans and sneakers but no one minded. Overall a great experience and definitely a place worth coming back too."}
{"text":"Love this place! Although they get really really busy and they don't take reservations, if you go early enough (around 6pm) you should be able to get seated promptly. Came here with 2 friends on a Friday night and we ordered a bunch of food and drinks and they were all fantastic. Some dishes were a little bit salty but nothing to steer us away! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I am a native Charlottean and this is my go to for anniversaries and birthdays. Also a must when we have people from out of town visiting.   No reservations and long waits but it is so worth it.   Small plates are perfect for sharing with a group with some of the most unique and robust flavors you will find. Some of our favorites are the pork belly tacos, southern fried nachos and the ramen bowl, but you cannot go wrong!   Their cocktails are out of this world and unlike other places worth the cost!"}
{"text":"A unique dining experience with incredible flavors! The cocktails are on point. One of our favorite spots for a date night. The problem is it's so packed, it's not even worth trying to get in on weekends. Much better to settle for during the week!"}
{"text":"Tapas style (small plates) restaurant. Each app was excellent. Really liked this placed and the drinks ere also good. Small space with limited seating so be prepared to sit outside."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and the food is awesome!  Their hummus and pita bread, rocks!!!  Oh and the Djs music is very soulful and will have you rocking in your chairs.  I will most definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, INCREDIBLE drinks, very fun atmosphere. Only negative was the noise. It was so loud that that we almost had to yell to each other at the table."}
{"text":"The customer service in this place is awful. We waited for an hour and a half only to be told that they gave our table away.  The manager did not offer an apology for the mistake and informed us that he could put us back on the list for another half an hour. He did not make any attempts to remedy for issue instead didn't care if we were going to write a bad review about the restaurant. The place is extremely loud for any kind of outing with friends and expect an extremely long wait that you may not be able to get in."}
{"text":"Soul has made a lot of changes since I've last visited when they first opened. I've recently gone back to meet star bartender Andy Maurer. If you're looking for a great, fun and creative cocktail experience...this is where you need to be. None of that crazy \"mixology\" stuff, just great drinks for real cocktailers. Also great food! The Korean BBQ wings, amazing! Friendly staff and great music. Most Monday's are old school night. And, I mean real old school. Marvin, Teddy, The Spinners, real deal music. Even if you just go for brunch, make sure you get there!"}
{"text":"Pros: Sushi is good  Cons: Service slow and lacking, music too loud, people seated too close to you.  Recommend to others: Yes, if they are the patient sort."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte visiting for business and stopped into Soul Gastrolounge. This place is AMAZING. The food was unique and full of flavor. Marshall the bartender was very sweet and personable. Even when we left around 9:45 on a Wednesday night, there were still people coming in trying to get a table. We did have to wait a little bit but it was well worth it. I would recommend showing up earlier rather than later. Great experience overall! I highly recommend for a new, fun place to eat/get drinks."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Charlotte, not even close. Tapas and sushi mostly, everything is good. I need places to have good energy to want to go back and Soul has it, good music, good food, mostly good service.  Highly recommend the Lamb Lollipops, Soul Wings, Southern Fried Oysters, Wild Mushrooms on Toast (yes, try it), and for sushi - Replay Roll and Soul Roll.  The cupcakes are hit or miss and have mostly been a miss for me lately.  I could eat here 5 times a week."}
{"text":"I wanted to order everything in the menu. Our waitress went above and beyond to make sure we were satisfied. Great and innovative food and they had a dj live mixing. The pork belly tacos are a must."}
{"text":"I always dread the long wait to get in but I totally get why there is one. Food is amazing, I've never had anything here that wasn't delicious. The family style portions are great for a girls night out!"}
{"text":"Amazing people and music. Food smelled divine, didn't eat, but the size of the crowd definitely said this ace was hoppin'! Great drinks and the service staff was amazing! Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"I'll definitely be back. I woke up this morning wondering what I'll try next time.  I'm ashamed to say it took me so long to eat at Soul (I'd been for drinks before). I'm a huge fan of the tapas style menu, and one of my favorite places no longer exists (Las Ramblas). Soul has great food. I loved the salmon o pita, saganaki (fried cheese), piquillo pepper bruschetta, and garlic french fries. The curried lamb skewers had awesome flavor, but were a tad bit dry. The marinated mushrooms weren't that memorable.  Our service was great. I tend to watch the wait/bar staff when I eat out, and I noticed they really get along and help each other out at Soul. I hope the owners appreciate them.  Comfortable atmosphere. I don't mind loud music as long as it's good. It was a pleasant experience, with great company :-)"}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Tried 4 or 5 tapas, beef chimichuri, Korean BBQ wings, ahi sashimi tacos, and the bone marrow!  Everything was very flavorful!  We also had the ginger mule which was on draft and it was very refreshing.  Service was also great and the only reason this place didn't get the 5th star is because it was quite loud.   Highly recommended and I'll definitely try to go out there again on my next trip to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Our second time here, and the food is amazing. We got the pork belly tacos (sweetly gazed & topped with a refreshing &a juicy watermelon) which are absolutely delicious, obviously very popular too because everyone had one. We also got the tuna tacos again because they're light and refreshing, and the crispness of the wonton taco is a perfect addition to it. I got the hamachi jalape√±o salad, which was amazing. Again, refreshing. My boyfriend got the chicken gyro, which was filling and tasty. I recommend this place to anyone. Price is a little up there though. Service is great. We ordered a drink and took way too long to arrive but other than that, it was great."}
{"text":"Okay so I have no idea why I have not written a review for Soul because this is my absolute favorite restaurant ever. In the world. First the Hip eclectic ambiance is perfect for date night or just a night cap with drink . The Dj is always on point and will have you grooving in your seat. The staff is always friendly and service is always great. I would recommend calling before hand seeing that this place is very popular and the wait can get a little lengthy depending on what time and what day of the week you go. They specialize in tapas, or small plates, which is why this place is perfect for someone who enjoys many flavors and wants to try many different things in one sitting. Each dish comes out as it is ready which is nice so you don't have to worry about everything coming out on top of each other.  I have had every thing on the menu with the exception of maybe one or two things but trust me I am getting around to it. Of course I have my favorites. The pork belly tacos are a must! Everything about them is why you should try them and I'm sure everyone who has had them will agree their truffle fries are amazing along with the fried brussels sprouts which give you a perfect balance of sweet and savory. I have had the curried lamb skewers, and the chimichurri beef which are both amaze-balls and you cant go wrong with either! The veal short ribs are to die for and you shouldn't hesitate on ordering that Ramen bowl! I can always go for those sashimi tuna tacos, the cucumber and sriracha mayo together in one bite is heaven! I always end my meal with one of those grilled caesar salads and I never regret it! They have an awesome sushi selection and the drink list is one of a kind! I wish I could give this place more stars! Soul has earned a spot in my taste bud heart forever  WELL DONE SOUL!"}
{"text":"Really great \"white table cloth\" restaurant for savvy bites and inventive cocktails.   Service is on point, and the staff is really attentive and well informed on menu items and bar selections.  When in doubt in the Queen City, you can't go wrong with dining at Soul!"}
{"text":"Randomly stopped by with a friend late on a Sunday night. Pleasantly surprised.  DJ was spinning some great tunes & the place was croweded. My friend knew the chef, who sent over a sampling of some Tapas. Very very nice. Staff was friendly & the environment was alot of fun. I've been to Good Food on Montford Dr. & this place is definitely up there with food quality. Look forward to going back again. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Meh.   Hostess didn't want to seat us at open bar tables (\"they fill up fast\" - right, by us for example?). Claimed 90 minute wait with nobody else waiting. Slooooow service after that (tapas should be relatively quick...)  Overpriced drinks ($12 for a Manhattan?) Menu seems all over the place (sushi, tapas, gastropub). Bland white bean dip. Very good fries, but nothing to dip them in. My kid liked the chicken skewers. Brussels sprouts were cooked well but were a bit greasy and a bit sweet. Also, they put bacon bits on it. Bacon. Bits.   Menu *looks* good but they miss the mark on a lot of it. I think they read some menus from good places in other cities, but never actually ate at any of them..."}
{"text":"Food is good. We got the Pan con tomate dish and a salad which was good not exceptional. Make sure you use the nowait app to put your name in before you arrive. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"2 hour wait? *cries* But I wanted good food so I waited. It was worth it! The highlight was the chicken skin nachos. We all know the best park of fried chicken is the skin, so they just took the skin and made nachos. The most gluttonous glorious dish ever. I don't think I will order them again, but they were certainly an experience.  Oh, and we sat at the bar right in front of the DJ, so much fun!"}
{"text":"Ask me a year ago and I would have nothing but good things to say about Soul.  Ask me now and meh it is.  The first few times I went there, it was wonderful. I sat at the little mini bar around the dj, feasted on sushi and reasonably priced beers and left happy.  The last few times I went I had to  *wait two hours for a table....on a Wednesday night.  I'm sorry? This is Plaza.  *joined some friends who were on the patio dining and when the server came around multiple times, she didn't even acknowledge us. Even when I started acting childish and saying I'm so thirsty as a hint. I did this because when I tried to flag her down before, she straight up walked away. *Get dripped on with rain water since the plastic covering for the patio wasnt wanting to cooperate. I hope it was rain water at least.  Their sushi rocked when I went the first few times and I would love to have it again but it wasn't in the sushi stars.   Oh Soul, you were like a bad boy crush. Fun for the first few times but no real future with you."}
{"text":"The wait really kills it. The food is so amazing and very reasonably price, but unless you're ready for a two+ hour wait, it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Ho-ly SMOKES. This spot is phenomenal and absolutely worth it. First off I'd like to mention you should use the yelp waitlist feature because this small location will get a long wait of easily an hour to three.  The chefs and owners of this restaurant clearly took time to create amazing flavor fusions in their food that you won't likely find elsewhere. Highly recommend the pork belly tacos, as well as the ramen. The ramen was different from any ramen I've ever had before and really had a unique twist with great bold flavors. We also tried a couple sushi rolls, both were amazing but my particular favorite was the special of the day, and also the lamb lollipops were absolutely worth the price. Judging on the tasting I had with a sprinkle of things across the menu I can only assume everything they have to offer is amazing. That being said if you go with a group I'd recommend ordering a lot and sharing with the table so you can try a bit of all the unique flavors! (PS, while we didn't order it my friend said the only thing they've ever had that they didn't like was the white bean dip so maybe stay away from that!)"}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming to Soul for a date night. It's ALWAYS packed so just be prepared to wait or sit at the bar. The food is hit or miss for me, but the portions are small and the menu's always changing that's the fun of it. The drinks are always good and the atmosphere is awesome"}
{"text":"The vibe here is really nice. Its definitely a good date night or mellow night out. There is a bit of a wait during their peak hours which could be a little discouraging if you are looking to sit quickly somewhere.  Although, it may be worth it to hang around a wait for  the bar or outside seating when the weather is nice. I had the sushi which was pretty good, most say its hard to mess up sushi but I disagree. The chicken wings are also a great bite. Their menu options are a tad different than your normal restaurants but who said you cant try something new. The service was pretty decent and the music sets off the nice vibe I was speaking of.   Overall, the experience was enjoyable. During our wait the floor manager made sure that we were taken care of from beginning to end. I would recommend them if you're looking for something relaxed with a good ambiance."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte! The venue itself is great, there's a lot of interesting art and a cozy environment.  The food here is SO good. I love the tapas situation because I got to try so many things. The first time I came I LOVED the flatbread, pork belly tacos, shrimp ceviche, and salmon pita. I couldn't decide which I liked best. We also got the lamb skewers which I'd give 7/10--pretty good but nothing exciting next to the other things we ordered. This was TOO MUCH FOOD, and we only ate about half and took the rest home. Depending on what you order I would say 3, maybe 4 dishes is good for 2 people. We also got a Sapporo each, which ended up coming in a HUGE can, 2 full drinks worth. All that plus tip came out to around 70$ if i remember correctly. Considering how much I'd heard about how pricey Soul is I thought it was a good deal and totally worth it for what we got.  The second time I came we got the lamb lollipops, the dip trio and the tuna tacos. All were great, especially the lamb (although not worth 20$) but I wasn't as blown away as I was the first time.  I've yet to try the sushi but WOW it looked good when I saw it being brought to other tables!  Both times we went on a Tuesday around 6:30 and were seated right away."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to this place but the food was  disappointing. The Korean bbq wings were spicy but had no flavor and were too dry. The fried oysters were breaded too heavily. The pork belly had poor texture and no flavor and was just soaking in a salty marinade."}
{"text":"We didn't wait long because we went on a Tuesday night and it was only me and my boyfriend. We were seated by the bar in the corner, which isn't a bad spot to be in!  There are only a few pescatarian friendly options but we had the hamachi and jalape√±o special, babaganoush, salmon taco, shrimp skewer and a sushi roll (the only one that didn't have a fried component). The waiter said they have the best sushi, but of course they do because everything was fried!   The hamachi had good flavor but mine had a piece of bone in it.  The salmon tacos were small for the price and the fried wanton was too greasy (I like the idea but it wasn't as tasteful as I thought) The shrimp skewers were good but not spectacular. A bit too salty for my taste! The babaganoush was good but the pita chips were overbaked.  The food comes out quickly, yet there is still a 3-hour wait on weekends. I suggest meat eaters to come give this place a try but may not be so suitable for pescatarians!"}
{"text":"Best places charlotte. Out of control good. Get the ramen, pork belly tacos, soul roll, lamb lolly pops (you really can't go wrong at this place) get the no wait app bc they don't take reservations but that really helps!"}
{"text":"Pork belly tacos were insanely good. Original and surprisingly perfect in every bite."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Stars! The food is excellent. We stopped in on a Monday night around 7:00 and were seated immediately. The vibe is relax chill set to a jazz/slow jams music background. Our server Marlon was excellent. We started with he ahi tuna tacos. Let me tell that you need to order one of these per person. There are three on the plate and you will not want to share! We also ordered the chimichuri skewer, shrimp ceviche, salmonkopia, and Korean wings. For dessert, the dark chocolate cupcake!!!! You cannot go wrong with anything on he menu. Go there now."}
{"text":"Can't believe I've never written a review for this place and I've been eating here since 2013. Let me start by saying they have been extremely consistent since 2013 which is rare and very important at the same time.  Consistent in many POSITIVE aspects: 1. The customer service from hostess to bartenders to servers at the table. 2. The food is consistently GOOD & we've eaten all over the menu from front to back. From Tapas to full plates to sushi to sides. 3. The drinks  are very consistent in flavor and alcohol levels to ice The one NEGATIVE consistency: 1. THE WAIT & not accepting reservations  The plus to the only negative consistency I have is that they offer table places using the NoWait app which is new and a HUGE plus. Lastnight my husband and I were at a concert and was able to put our name down in line while enjoying the last two acts because it specified that we had 89 - 110 minutes before our table would be ready and showed us that there were 24 parties before us.  Let's Get down to the goodies. The food is not complex it's straight forward and GOOD. Some of our go to's are: Sashimi tacos  Fried oysters  Garlic shrimp skewers  Lamb lollipops  Beef skewer  A number of sushi rolls which we tried the Godzilla lastnight and wasn't a huge fan due to the cream cheese. I asked if they could only put 1% on and was told YES however they put 101%. It was too creamy and we ended up picking out the cream cheese per piece before eating.  Our server was super cool and he noticed all the cream cheese on our plates and once we ordered dessert Chocolate Bread pudding (which was amazing) he brought it out and informed us that he was comping it due to the mix up with the cream cheese which we Super cool as we didn't complain we just took the cream cheese out and ate the roll. This place is the perfect DateNight spot with the dim lighting and cool music. It's also a cool spot to catch up with friends and enjoy some drinks and small plates.  If you are going for the first time please note that it's not accessible friendly as you have to climb the black fire escape black cast iron stairs to enter. Don't quote me on this because maybe there is a secret elevator that no one knows about but I've never seen it or I inquired about it. I'll find out and update my review if such a thing exist."}
{"text":"The drinks are awesome. While the food is pretty good, It adds up since they are small plates. Don't go there hungry, but more so to enjoy drinks and an appetizer. Always prepare for an hr wait."}
{"text":"We went to Soul this past Saturday night for dinner for the first time.  We were impressed by our initial entrance.  The restaurant/bar is situated on the 2nd floor of an old restored brick building.  The outdoor seating offered fantastic views of the Charlotte Uptown skyline.  Inside there are a few booths (with high backs), a few tables, a bar, a DJ booth with stools, and some sofas and chairs.  All in all, it offered a great, casual, fun atmosphere.  The place was \"hopping,\" but luckily, we were seated right away at some empty stools indoors around the DJ booth (who wasn't there at the time).    The menu offers a variety of tapas.  We had a hard time picking out which ones we would order, but finally were able to narrow it down to five to share.  We chose the (1) Sashimi Tuna Tacos, (2) Lamb Lollipops, (3) Bone Marrow, (4) Boursin Cheese Stuffed Piquillo Peppers on Bruschetta, and (5) the Sushi Crunch Roll.   The tuna tacos were very flavorful and were like very mini tacos.  The lamb was good and tender, but I probably wouldn't order them again because I'd rather try some of their other (cheaper) skewers of meat.  We were adventurous with the bone marrow, but it was our least favorite and something we wouldn't order again.  It was a little too gel-like for my taste, although one of them tasted like egg (?).  The bruschetta was creamy and rich with flavor.  I'd definitely order that again.  The sushi crunch roll was huge!  It was very wide, so we had to cut it in half before eating it.  I liked it, but I've had better crunch rolls, so I'd try a different kind of sushi roll next time.    Our server was fantastic.  She was very friendly and, being that it was our first time, she explained a little bit about the menu.  Even though she had several other tables, she kept checking on us after each tapas was brought out.    All in all, we had a fantastic time and it's a great place to hang out for a date night, with friends, or to bring out-of-town guests who like a vibrant scene."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Charlotte. The food is delicious and ambience is cozy with a sultry vibe."}
{"text":"Incredible small plates that delight the palate. I love the pork belly tacos!! The sushi is fantastic and the truffle fries are sinfully delicious. With amazing drinks by inspired bartenders you will have a gastronomic delight!"}
{"text":"tl;dr: GET THE ASIAN GLAZED PORK BELLY TACOS WITH WATERMELON SALSA!!!!!  More notes: Only reason I took off a star is because they don't take reservations and seating is limited. Show up when they open (5pm) or be prepared for a long wait. We've waited 30 minutes on a Friday night before.   Made the mistake of going on a Saturday night around 7pm and they told us the wait was going to be 2-2.5 hours. That's insane. We tried to wait for a seat at the bar, but it was too packed and you'd practically have to get in a fist fight with other couples waiting for the same thing. We ended up placing our order to go- the bartender was super nice about this, gave us water with cucumber slices while we waited, and was very friendly. The menu is small plates, and I have always been with my husband and we order anywhere from 3-5 to share.   Since this review is skewing negative, let me get to the positive. ASIAN GLAZED PORK BELLY TACOS WITH WATERMELON SALSA!!!!! This is all you need to order. In fact, this may be all you need to eat again for the rest of your life. This menu item should be trademarked. As we were eating them, eyes closed in ecstasy, I wondered who the chef was behind these tacos. They cannot possibly be paying him or her enough. These tacos are seemingly simple. They are small flour tortillas topped with exactly 3 cubes of the Asian glazed pork belly and 3 cubes of watermelon \"salsa\", which is really just watermelon in some sort of vinegary marinade. I am seriously not doing these justice right now. I don't even love pork all that much, but I will always order these- they are life-changing. For frame of reference, That time we got the to-go order we ordered 4 orders of the pork belly tacos, 2 for each of us. Didn't give the rest of the menu a second glance.  We have eaten at Soul a handful of times now, tried various other things on the menu. We tried the sushi, it's fine. We tried the bone marrow, for fun, and that was cool and tasty. But we always come back to those tacos. They might be my death-row last meal sort of choice. The combination of sweet, salty, sour, crunchy....I am drooling just thinking about these, days later.   Oh, the cocktails are also good. :)"}
{"text":"I'm throwing my lot in with Julia on this one. Soul is an Uptown restaurant that somehow got lost down Central Ave. Trapped on the wrong side of the tracks. It isn't comfortable here.  The food was nice enough. I was surprised at how much of the menu didn't appeal to me, but that's probably a function of them being adventurous cooks and me being a picky patron. Regardless, I found somethings I wanted, and when the food arrived (green onion hummus, salmon-o-pita, and mini-burgers) it was delicious. Not paradigm changing, but definitely worthwhile.  Yet the meal's experience was lacking. It had the loud, rowdy atmosphere of Plaza Midwood, but also the snobbery of aging Uptown frat boys. That is a weird combination. I like the Plaza Midwood energy. I can handle frats. But they don't work well together.  And vis-√†-vis music, I prefer Twenty One downstairs."}
{"text":"Happily surprised with this place. The interior is very cool with the original exposed brick, that said when it's 30 degrees outside (not very often in CLT) you'll need to keep your coat on inside, it was cold! When I see a menu this large and so varied I tend to cringe...there's no way they can do all of these things really well. I was wrong. Ordering is tapas style which we love, sharing a bunch of plates.  Had the tacos w watermelon, Red Dragon sushi roll, ramen bowl, and Fries. All were very well done, great playing and strong tastes. The fries were our favorites, no need for sauce or condiments, tacos were cool, different and surprising. Ramen was legit great the broth is superb. Sushi was good but not amazing in our opinion, wish we would've ordered the stuffed shells that a table next to us got, they raved and it looked awesome. For dessert we had the bread pudding which was very good. Walked out with drinks 70$ for two of us....for this kind of food and ambiance that is super cheap. We will b back to try more of the menu!!"}
{"text":"Just go. Order the truffle fries, the pork belly tacos, & whatever sushi special on the menu that sounds good to you. It was a PARTY in my mouth! I get goose bumbs thinking about it. This was the best food experience I have had in NC thus far. Thank me later."}
{"text":"Soul is one of the best places to eat in Charlotte. The dirty South nachos, the shells and cheese, and the pork belly tacos (of course) are favorites. The wait is ridiculously long on the weekends, so try a visit during the week."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite little specialty restaurants in Charlotte. Located in the funky neighborhood of Plaza-Midwood, across from Fuel, this place is small, but worth the wait, which I would expect if you get there to eat after 7pm. However, this is an official PBR restaurant and waiting for me is quite enjoyable!   Menu is all small plate and has something for everyone. I'm a fan of the sushi, tuna tacos, small sandwiches and the lounge atmosphere. Come here with an appetite and an open mind to try anything and everything. I find myself coming here often and trying a little of the same and a little something different every time. That's the fun of Soul. (and the PBR of course)"}
{"text":"Took a while to get seated, but it was worth the wait.  The service was good as well as the food and drinks.  The pork belly watermelon tacos were my favorite."}
{"text":"My cousin and I were in town from NY and Texas and decided to try Gastro because the reviews were decent and there were only few restuarants open pass 11pm.  At 10pm on a Friday night, the place was packed and the wait was ridiculous. A 90 minute wait for two people. We spoke to the hostess told her we were from out of town and she seemed really eager for us to stay and enjoy their food. We waited for a table for about an hour. Not horrible. I'm sure the hostess had something to do with that. She was very sweet and welcoming.  I'm glad we waited. The food is fantastic. Definitely try the Pork Belly tacos. Three perfect bites of tasty excellence. To die for! We also tried the Garlic Shrimp skewers and Korean BBQ wings. Both were delicious as well."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a Friday night with the ladies or a romantic date night. Get the Pork Belly Watermelon tacos and your life will change as you know it. The Brussels Sprouts are good too. The rest of the food was ok. This place is tiny, so the wait will probably be long. We waited 2.5 hours on a Friday night, but we just hopped over to Peculiar Rabbit next door and had drinks at the bar while we waited. They had a DJ and it felt very metropolitan."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant to visit with outstanding small plates. Worth the short distance from D'town."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Charlotte. Perfect for girls night or a first date. Tapas plates so good for sharing. Must try Watermelon tacos absolutely amazing. I would suggest downloading no wait so that you can show up when your table is ready, only downfall is always a long wait but worth it, especially when using the no wait app."}
{"text":"WAIT TIME and SERVICE: Wait time even for a Monday was much longer than needed. We were told outdoor seating wait time was 15-20 minutes, however the wait ended up being about 40 minutes. The host apologized and thanked us for waiting patiently. Our waiter was fantastic and extremely polite and everything was brought out within proper time. I would give this place a 4/5 stars for my waiter if the food tasted better.  FOOD: The specials item on Monday was Red Dragon sushi (not sure of the exact name, but it had tuna) with chicken dumplings. This is more than enough for one person, especially if you're a woman and hungry :) BUT it was not mind blowing. Keep in mind you're ordering sushi at a restaurant with random menu items. I had also ordered the Midsummer Night cocktail that tasted very watered down. All in all, I would come here for the pretty lights and good music, but food and drinks were just okay."}
{"text":"Wow. This is, hands down, one of the best restaurants in Charlotte. After being told about it constantly, I finally made my way there. Since my first visit three weeks ago, I have been back 3 times (thats how good the Pork Belly Tacos are). Along with the pork belly tacos, the other 8 plates at my table including the ahi tuna tacos, steak skewers, the crunchy roll, lamp lollipops, and all the other items were all absolutely delicious - nothing disappointed.   While I clearly love the food, the service is attentive and the ambiance is really eclectic and comfortable also making for a great experience. However, Soul only got $ stars from me because for even such an amazing restaurant, the three hour wait was a little overkill. I got forced into waiting, because yes I like it that much, but since you can sit and eat, talk, and drink for so long, people end up hanging around forever. For not having that many tables and being permitted to sit for 4 hours, if you so choose, the place gets a bit cluttered and you end up waiting a long time.   I guess when people agree to wait for three hours to eat there, they dont really care but the amount of extra business they could be doing is unfortunate.   But if I leave you with anything...its get the pork belly tacos!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant.  The pork belly watermelon tacos were unbelievable.  It's good to see Charlotte restaurants taking it to the next level."}
{"text":"WATERMELON PORK BELLY. If you only get one thing on the menu, get the Watermelon Pork Belly. It is melt in your mouth and the sweet from the watermelon is a perfect combo. It is a TAPAS place so, one dish is NOT going to fill you up. So I think the $$ is misleading. It should be $$$ due to the fact that you have to order multiple plates to be tastefully satisfied. Drinks are sky high in cost. There is limited seating and you may end up in the lounge area eating on a couch and a coffee table. Get a drink before dinner downstairs at Twenty Two (a gallery / bar) and look at some art. Actually it is a great place to go to get a drink while you wait for your table upstairs."}
{"text":"I am so MEHHHHH about about Soul Gastrolounge.   This was one of the places highest on my list to try after moving to Charlotte! My girlfriend and I had a weekend visit from one of our other friends who is super into food, so we saw this as the perfect chance to give it a shot.  They don't take reservations at Soul G so we went later on a Friday night (around 9:30 PM) expecting it to be a little crowded. We ended up having to wait around 10-15 minutes to be seated so we were all good there.  While waiting, we each ordered a cocktail. The only things I remember about the cocktail was that it was mezcal-based (because I love it), and that it was room temperature. It was NOT good. Not a great start.  Once we were seated, that's when it really went downhill for us. We were seated in the back corner right next to the DJ and right underneath a speaker blaring music. The music was BUMPING and not in a good way. It was crazy loud and way too much volume for a dinner. I get it was Friday night around 9:30 but we were screaming at each other from across the table. Not fun. I'm not sure exactly what vibe they were going for here. We did ask the server if it was possible to get the music turned down a tad but I'm not sure he ever got to it.  LUCKILY, the food we ordered was actually pretty good and we were able to scream approval to one another after most of the dishes.  Asian Glazed pork belly tacos - 4/5 - You might see pictures of this all over the place and rightfully so. That's not a combo I'd really think of but the pork is juicy AF and the watermelon goes great with it. I'm not a huge fan of watermelon in the first place but it worked.  Pan Con Tomate - 5/5 - THIS was just awesome. A little bit different take on pan con tomate with spanish chorizo, a rioja reduction, and whipped manchego. As a huge manchego fan, this was a really fun one for me.  Bone Marrow - 4/5 - Love me some bone marrow. Tons of flavor but didn't really have all that much to go with the toasts. Tough to split between 3 people.  Spanakopita - 3/5 - Eh. It was alright. Served fresh which helped its cause, but I'd say if you aren't craving it, go with something else.  Queen Charlotte Roll - 5/5 - YES. tempura shrimp, cucumber, capelin roe. Big time score.  Fries - 4/5 - Came with garlic-herb salt, pecorino, and truffle. Some places overdo it on the truffle when it comes to fries but these were pretty good and served fresh.  All in all, the food was good here but the rest of the experience was just kinda disappointing. If I come back, I'll do so earlier or on a different night and I suggest if you want to enjoy some conversation that you do the same."}
{"text":"seriously. my favorite place in charlotte. try the guacamole stack and goat cheese bruschetta. amazing!  the ambiance is perfect for a date or girls night out.  give it a whirl!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Soul. Like - extremely.  Driving up, I was mortified to see that Soul was \"that sketchy place I pointed out last time we went to Dish.\" It's in a building where the downstairs tenant is gone and has been replaced by brown paper window coverings. The building next door has chains on the windows. So it doesn't scream - this is a good idea!  HOWEVER! Once you step into Soul, it's a different world. Very cool decor and trendy crowd. A+ for the atmosphere. Booths, tables, couches, bar, outdoor.. whatever seating arrangement you please.  The wait can be long, but there is an area to sit or you can go outside and wait and they welcome you to visit the bar in the meantime.   The drinks are hit or miss. I was served some \"famous martini\" that I thought may end my life at any moment and didn't have even a hint of goodness to it. Since then, I have avoided what the bartender \"recommends\" and go with what I'm feeling.. so far, much better.  The food is not hit or miss. It's very hit. The lamp lollipops are very memorable. They were my first bite at Soul and are my first bite every other visit. Fried Meatballs - very good. Soul Grilled Cheese - delicious. Skewers - YUM YUM YUM (have had the garlic shrimp, gyro, chicken and beef). \"Soul Original\" suchi rolls - yes, please! And the truffle, garlic, herb, whatever fries - I can not eat enough of those. It's just not possible.   I would definitely recommend a visit to Soul. It is all-around great. I've been on a date night with the boyfriend and taken my mom for a girl's night, been with girlfriends. It's perfect for any dinner outing."}
{"text":"This place really impressed me. I absolutely loved every aspect of it. It's a small and cozy size and dimly lit. It's got a really cool, eclectic vibe about it. Everything we ordered was delicious except for the eggplant dip. My friend and I savored every bite. We shared the truffle fries, the trio of dips (the tzatiki was fantastic), the chimichurri kebab, and the goat cheese & honey flatbread. I highly recommend this place and will be going back soon! I wouldn't bring large groups just because there isn't much seating available. And for sure come early. If you wait till past 7 there will be a long wait."}
{"text":"This place had some amazing options as far as food. The ambience is very nice and they are always busy! Our server was on top of her game and extremely sweet! The drinks were good on price and so was the food! Definitely get some sushi and if you like cheese, the fried goat cheese was amazing. We will definitely be back!   My only negative was that the host had us wait and drink at the bar, but sat people before us who came in after us that waited at the front. He also had the booths available to be seated, but he sat us at the sushi bar instead.. after we said we didn't wanna be at the bar. If someone says they don't want the bar, make sure to ask them if the sushi bar is okay before seating them there. Wasn't what we wanted, especially since three different seating options opened up, but I guess since we were just two people we weren't enough to take up such space."}
{"text":"The food is to die for! The most original small plates, all delicious. The problem is that they don't take reservations at all and the place stays packed. We got there really early, before 5:30, and there was already a wait. And you have to stay there while you wait. Once we were seated, the music was so loud that we couldn't talk. We were right by a speaker. I asked about a solution and our great server turned our speaker off till we finished. OMG, the good is so good, it might be worth the wait at times!"}
{"text":"Wow! Drinks & tapas are unbelievable! Pork belly tacos are a must followed by lamb skewers! Goat cheese dip and bruschetta. tuna sushi was so so fresh! Everything was amazing, knowledgable & sweet staff. Cocktails  don't miss out on this spot or the cupcake for dessert"}
{"text":"everything is great about this place. My only wish is that they expand soon to be able to handle the crowds that come in and have better lighting on the patio for night dinners. I love that they post their daily specials on facebook and twitter. Also their brunch is awesome.  I recommend the chicken and waffle for brunch. For dinner i always get the soul roll and the wings or the cheeseplate as an appetizer. All the drinks are unique and won't disappoint you."}
{"text":"You've got yourself a new fan.   Forget all the cons that other reviews mentioned. No one is perfect. And based on my experience...you are totally worth it.   Why? Because the food is pretty damn amazing!   I tried a lot of menu items and my favorites of the night were the pork belly tacos (shocker...I know) and the Godzilla roll. But honestly, everything that I tasted was good! There's so much more that I look for and to trying.   And I was also impressed with the service too! Everyone from the hostess to our waitress and the severs that brought the food out...were all fantastic.  I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Definitely a 5 star experience. We had to wait 2 hours for a table (literally) but it was completely worth it! Excellent sushi, tuna tacos and white bean dip, and the drinks are unique creations worth trying. Visiting from out of town but next time we are here we will go back for another taste!"}
{"text":"Always great. Honestly, the only reason I might not give it 5 stars is because of how hard it is to get a table.  But, I'll let that slide, can't hate just because its popular.  Solid food, great drinks, and cool vibes.  What's not to love.  The pork belly tacos are probably the best known item on the menu.  I am definitely a fan.  The tuna tacos are pretty tasty as well.  The lamb lollipops are great, but not a whole lot of food per dollar compared to some other items on the menu.  Similar with the mushrooms on toast.  I don't if I've actually had anything bad here.  Check this place out at least for a quick drink, a Moscow Mule on tap perhaps, but stay for some snacks as I think you will enjoy them."}
{"text":"this is one of my favorite places to go anywhere. the food is unreal. they have a wide range of different foods that are always fresh, sexy and tastey. its really packed on the weekends and very limited seating but i enjoy going there on slower nights and i love the house music that the dj's always play. it can be a very relaxing, living room type feel to the place."}
{"text":"Friendly awesome staff. Wonderful food options. Great view to uptown!"}
{"text":"Good food but a little too loud for conversations. But still... good food  A little waiting is required as they are slammed. So don't come here extremely hungry."}
{"text":"Food was okay, but I was so completely shocked at how unprofessional the management was. Three were told 45-hour wait, and then waited an hour and a half to be seated while they continued to seat parties of two and six at 3/4 person tables who came in. I know things get hectic, I know sometimes there are reservations we're not aware of, however ANY other establishment would not have let one party wait for 1 1/2 hours (especially 30+ mins over their estimate), while that happened.  We finally got seated and my sister asked to see the manager and way too nicely explained the situation was a bit frustrating. The manager looked at her blankly and goes \"uh well sometimes there are things you don't know about....i guess i can get you a glass of wine? Try to enjoy you meal though\".  Completely offensive and unprofessional, however what made it so much worse is that even though he was the one delivering our food, he didn't come back once to check to make sure we were okay. And not that we were trying to get free food, but didnt take a single plate off (btw we spent well over $200 on the meal, so it wouldn't have hurt), NOTHING.   Everything aside, whether we were right or wrong, it's the the managers duty to make sure we had a good experience, and he could honestly have not been more condescending or cared less. Any other restaurant manager would have been horrified.   Definitely never coming back. There are better places to waste time for a $200 meal."}
{"text":"I'm new to Charlotte but this place has become one of my favorite lounge spots!! I decided to try this place out when a friend and I were looking for somewhere to go in the Charlotte area on a Friday night and we were both entirely over the typical club scene. We decided to check them out after reading some reviews online and we were not disappointed!! The food is awesome and very reasonably priced. The sushi is very popular here. The drinks aren't that strong, at least not to me, but I'm somewhat of a \"drinker\" so take that for what it's worth. Service was great. Our waiter took time to go over the menu with us and point out some of the more popular and highly recommended dishes. He was really patient and nice and he even brought me a free glass of wine from the bar. I have no idea why but I didn't question it! The only downside to this place is that it's really small but very popular so depending on what time you arrive, you may find yourself waiting for a long time to be seated. We arrived around 10pm and were told there would be a 45 minute wait. We were able to find a small space at the bar to hang out and ended up ordering a few drinks and some of their AMAZING Garlic fries while we waited. This place probably wouldn't be the best spot to take a large group of people but they do have group seating areas that can accommodate a small group of 5 or 6. Parking was free and close to the building so we didn't have to walk far.   If you decide to check it out it's a must you try the Garlic fries....by far the best fires I've ever had! I'd also recommend the Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos (different but awesome), the Sushi Fondu, and the Korean BBQ Soul Wings."}
{"text":"Yummy, unique and not pretentious! Unique, eclectic and lots of great craft drinks! One of my favs. Only thing is sitting is limited and have to do stairs so usually hard for older folks. Worth it though!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, shitty host service. There were at least four tables open, but no one was being seated. Talk about losing the opportunity to up sell and increase profits. Just because a table gets sat doesn't mean you should leave the other 4 tables empty."}
{"text":"Soul is always in my top Charlotte restaurants-to-recommend list. This place is amazing. Tiny, but amazing nonetheless.   Soul is tucked away in the second floor of a brick building in the busy, hip neighborhood of Plaza Midwood. There is ALWAYS a wait for a table at night and for brunch when available. They do not take reservations so if you're smart you'll try to get there early to get your name on the list. There have been several nights I've easily waited an hour and a half for a table and just went downstairs to 22 (an art gallery that serves alcoholic beverages) to have a couple beers before they sent a text saying our table was ready.   Soul's menu consists of tapas and sushi. It's best to order 2 small plates per person and share everything. My favorites are the Soul Roll (sushi), Lamb Lollipops, Cheese Plate, Chimichuri Beef Skewers. Goat Cheese Balls and Tuna Tacos. You can't go wrong with anything at Soul. Also, ask your server for the daily specials. They're usually crazy unique and worth trying.   The atmosphere at Soul reminds me of a small hip restaurant in New York. A DJ spins while you eat dinner or sip on craft cocktails at the bar. The decor and small space make for a vibe that is inviting, warm, and eclectic.   Parking in this area of Plaza Midwood sucks so be on the lookout for tow-friendly spots. You can sometimes park at the parking lot across the street for $5. Good luck finding street parking at night.  If you're planning on making a night of it at Soul, bring some loot. For dinner and drinks for 2 people, you're likely to spend between $100-$150. Well worth it for a fun date night that's different from the usual.   Soul should definitely be on your list of Charlotte restaurants to visit if it isn't already. It's an awesome spot for a date night or with a small group of friends. FYI, large tables will wait forever to be sat, if at all so keep it small!"}
{"text":"Very good and affordable Tapas style restaurant. Good atmosphere...different and refreshing from the balance of CLT eateries."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Great add to Plaza Midwood. Atmosphere is awesome, food delicious. Love the fried oysters, mini-tuna tacos and ahi. Good skewers. You will wait forever for a table, so if you go make sure you're going to make a night out of it, have a bunch of drinks and chill while you wait. If you're looking for the one hour, in and out, it's not for you."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Their music is always fantastic. Dishes can run on the small side, which I think can throw off some people that don't understand the tapas concept, but if you go in understanding that then you won't be disappointed. Another thing - like a true tapas place, they serve dishes as they are made and say so on their menu, so don't expect all your food to come out together. This does mean that all their dishes are exceptionally fresh. Also, mad props to the kitchen. I've never had anything less than perfect and they have a pretty big menu for such a small kitchen. Their servers are all really helpful and charismatic. Their hostesses could use some math lessons because they say the wait is going to be an hour or longer and then we are always seated within fifteen. Signature bar drinks can seem a bit pretentious, but bartenders have no problem making the drinks you actually want. In summary, this is my favorite place in Charlotte right now.   Fav dishes: Dirty South Nachos and Pork Belly Tacos. Both phenomenal and not to be missed."}
{"text":"Soul is one of the most unique, yet highly recognized restaurants in Charlotte. It's located off Central Avenue, which is quite eclectic, yet boasts a variety of great restaurants and food options.  Soul is one of those places you seek to take out of towners, or \"newbies\" to Charlotte. The menu changes occasionally, yet there are some mainstay choices that are always available and you HAVE to try (i.e. pork belly watermelon tacos).  Soul is a very small space, which gives it a cozy, friendly and intimate setting. They have a handful of tables, or you could find yourself on stools sitting closely to other couples. There is even a lounge area with couches and comfy chairs. If you're lucky enough to snag one of few tables on the porch outside, you have a gorgeous view of the city skyline. They also have a small bar where you can have a drink while you wait. While they don't take reservations, they have started taking down your cell phone number so you can check out some other places nearby (Peculiar Rabbit, Bistro La Bon) and they will text you when your table is ready.   Soul is mostly known for their tapas style dishes, and they offer great sushi too. I've been a handful of times, though this was before I was into the phase if photographing my food. Some of my favorite dishes include the pork belly tacos (no brainer), the lam lollipops, the fried brussel sprouts, fried oysters, eggplant parm, grilled cheese, housemade gyro, and any of their current specials for dessert (They usually have outrageous combos of cupcakes that are so amazing).   Things I wouldn't recommend - dirty south nachos (the fried chicken \"chips\" just weren't up to soul's standard), salads. There are too many other good things at soul, so I tell people to stay away from the salads. I'm a dietitian so I'm all about some additional veggies, but take my word on this."}
{"text":"Best Tapas Ever. The drinks ain't cheap, but the food is reasonably priced.   The brunch menu is delicious as well  I wish I lived in Charlotte so I could eat here more often,"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  I love everything about it, except the capacity.  It's easier to get a spot to eat when it's just me and my girlfriend or with 1 other couple. If you have more than 4 in your party, you will definitely have a good wait on the weekends.  That being said, I don't mind a wait when I'm dining here because I'll either get one of their finely crafted cocktails or go downstairs to Twenty-Two (See my review).  Once I get a table...IT'S ON.  The restaurant is a fusion of American, Greek, and Japanese (well, sushi mainly).  It's tapas style and I'll usually order 2 small plates at a time to split.  It's a pretty interesting menu when you bring all 3 of these together.  My favorite dish is hands down the sashimi tuna tacos.  My eyes usually roll into the back of my head as I savor each bite.  They just taste so fresh and smooth.  We always get the cheese plate to nibble on throughout the meal, and it's massive...a really good value.  The spanikopita is a favorite and we always get a roll of sushi.  They have great sushi.  The quality is there and you can taste it. They have a great brunch too, love the pimiento mac n' cheese.  They also have these breakfast pierogis with fried bologna and maple syrup.  That dish is out of this world.  I love the selection of music (very loungy) and the patio overlooks the skyline of Charlotte.  Soul was voted one of the city's best restaurants for a reason."}
{"text":"Fun, high-energy atmosphere, good drinks, delicious food. Last time, we split Babaganoush, Southern Fried Oysters and sushi (Eel Roll, Crunch Roll and Queen Charlotte Roll) and some strong, yet tasty cocktails. Sushi, seafood and tapas are three of my favorite things in the world, plus awesome music + DJs... so much love."}
{"text":"Went here a little while back and not really sure about the hype... Maybe I'm missing something... The food is okay at best and the service is...well...terrible... I guess terrible is not even appropriate since we barely got any service. We sat outside since inside is incredibly loud and you can barely hear the person sitting next to you. Our server came and brought us 1 menu... We we asked for another one he said he didn't have any, even though one was sitting right behind him; so we helped ourselves... We ordered drinks which took about 25 minutes to come... After this he didn't even take our order... It took another 25 minutes for us to be able to order... and I should mention the outside sitting area was maybe half full, so not like he was terribly busy... When the food came it was just ok... The white bean and goat cheese dip is not a dip no natter what they say... It's merely cooked white beans with some goat cheese mixed in.... Overall the place is not very good... Lots of hype but nothing special... Probably won't be coming back..."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is trendy and fun. Good wait staff.   Parking is terrible and to be expected.  Over priced for the food.   We ordered at least 8 different dishes and only 2 were good.  Probably would not come back for food.  Just drinks and the atmosphere. Somebody needs to check their taste buds in the kitchen. Nothing tasted the way it was supposed to."}
{"text":"Great cocktails and the lamp Popsicles are AMAZING!!!  Warm atmosphere rounds out this excellent establishment."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, you will spend a lot of money if you go here. The small plates are $6-15 each but we ended up needing 3ish per person. Additionally, the cheapest wine bottles run in the 30's. With that being said, I am not complaining. Just be aware that you're not going to be filled up after 1 plate. Its best to go with a group of 3-4 so you can order more dishes and try out a lot! The atmosphere is awesome! Just make sure to get here early because the wait will be long. We got the cabernet and it was great! Here is a break down of the food....  Dirty South Nachos- 5/5 Chicken skins fried and topped with melted pimento cheese. I have always been a fan of the skin of the chicken and this was heavenly for someone who loves fried food... just not very healthy   Sashimi Tuna Tacos- 5/5 They were perfect especially the sriracha mayo  Flatbread 3/5- It was average to us  Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos- 5/5 They don't look like what you expect tacos to look like but they are really tasty. The watermelon is a unique twist  Sticky Veal Short Ribs-4/5 Solid choice!  Pan Con Tomate- 5/5- Recommended by our waitress and the ultimate favorite of the table  Spanakopita- 4/5 Good but you don't get as much as you expect and it can't beat traditional Greek made   Bone Marrow- 2/5 We were being adventurous and probably just don't like bone marrow. I won't hold it against them.  The service was EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"You know, we came here for the tapas dishes which were phenomenal. BUT, we were shocked at how good their sushi rolls are too! Some of the best I've had! This place is now near the top of of our \"go to\" list for Charlotte."}
{"text":"I love the vibe at Soul. It is intimate and quirky. The dishes are generally good and they are adventurous. But, don't call a dish ramen just because it has Ramen-style noodles. For now, stick to the classics, but always order dessert!"}
{"text":"A couple things to know about Soul is that they don't take reservations, the place is small, and there inevitably is a long wait unless you come at opening time. It's got a hip cool vibe and service in general is good. I've been a couple of times and every time love love love their ramen bowl. It certainly is NOT traditional ramen but kind of an american/italian fusion on ramen with a cheese based sauce rather than the typical pork broth. The noodles are always cooked well and the overall dish is bursting with flavor. Most people like the pork belly tacos which is good but I definitely wasn't wowed like most people. Have tried a variety of other things such as their brussel sprouts, mac and cheese, mussels, and bone marrow. Everything was good but again, it's the ramen bowl that keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Really wanted to go to this place for a while now. Today was finally the day. First and foremost, I have to say, that this was the most non-family friendly place ever. No high chairs or booster seats, also, we got a tiny table for 3 people (me, my husband, and our toddler). Even though our server was otherwise great, he only served the table for 2, and only brought a third glass for water upon request. We ordered two small plates: Rocky Mountain oysters (pretty good, too much cornmeal, which took away from the delicate flavor, in my opinion), and Shells stuffed with pulled pork in cheese sauce (the pork filling was on the dry side and overall underwhelming, even though the cheese sauce was delicious). My husband also had a steak and eggs sandwich, which was for some reason was served open-faced and pretty much impossible to eat as a sandwich. I tried a few bites - it was very under seasoned, although the quality of steak was top-notch. I ordered a chicken pita wrap - absolutely delicious, no complaints there.  For dessert we had the chocolate brioche bread pudding, which tasted more like a dry brownie; and banana turnovers, which were decent, but not more than that.  A few other tables around us ordered food that looked and smelled much better. And the tables are so close together that you could really really see and smell what the other people are eating)) and hear their conversations, and occasionally rub elbows.  I'm considering coming back in a solely grown up company, to try some of the cocktails, bone marrow, noodle bowl and the Korean bbq chicken wings.  It wasn't a terrible experience, but definitely a bit of a let down."}
{"text":"Apparently we were lucky to be seated at the bar, the restaurant filled Saturday when they opened and stayed that way our entire visit.  Despite this, our order was filled quickly.  Fantastic beer selection, we shared garlic truffled fries, and Muy Beueno Roll (sushi).  Our server was awesome, we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Great service, ask for Fletcher. I encourage you to ask questions about the menu. The meatballs are he best you will ever have."}
{"text":"Loved the drinks, the food (we had many things last night not one was less than wonderful).drink menus was unique. Great place highly recommend.  Love this place."}
{"text":"In previous experiences here, the food has been great. Service is not the best. The hostess was rude tonight and we ended up leaving before being seated. I can say we will never come back because there are too many other great places in Charlotte with better service."}
{"text":"I must be the only one who had a problem with this place.  I will preface this review by saying that I prefer the dives over the hip and trendy so my opinion my be biased.  I recently met a friend here to partake in their dinner menu.  I must say that first off, I was very unimpressed by their beer selection. They only had your standard Domestics on tap/bottle (Budweiser, Michelob and Miller).  I don't understand how this is possible given that Twenty-Two is right below them with a laundry list of great beers.  However, their wine selection looked admirable but alas, I'm not a wine drinker so that's were a star is lost for me.    The Food:  Overpriced but delicious.  My order of Hummus was more filling than my entree of the Pork Belly tacos.  I will say that the Pork Belly was amazing especially when paired with Watermelon, which I wasn't expecting at all.  My friend ordered the shrimp tacos and enjoyed them much the same.   The Environment:  Trendy with various ambient, trip-hop music.   I think that this would be a great meet up place after dinner with non beer drinkers.  There are definitely more affordable places to congregate with a better alcohol content.  Just don't come here hungry and on a budget because you'll just end up somewhere else an hour later."}
{"text":"On a work trip and thought I'd give it a shot. Cool atmosphere and vibe, good looking crowd, unique food options and drink menu. Good ended up being really good, had bone barrow and tuna tacos along with an off the menu sushi. Service was a little slow, but worth the wait. Drop in"}
{"text":"Food took a bit longer, the bar staff, two gentlemen; were very accommodating! A fantastic mix of sushi and tapas. It is even open late, a great addition to the culinary scene, in Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good for date night or a small group. The bacon Brussel sprouts and pork belly watermelon tacos are a must if you go! Amazing service, went on a Saturday night and surprisingly the wait was only a little over an hour. Typically weekends you'll want to get there early to get in."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte! Love the tapas style and atmosphere. Great drinks too! Pork belly tacos are a must."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the fuss is about. It has a cool interior and I wouldn't say it was not nice because it was. But the tables are so close together that you feel like you are on a group date. For some reason they did not have nearly enough menus and people were asked to share and people were asking tables next to them to borrow theirs so it was weird. Service was good, no complaints there. Food was OK but I thought it was overpriced and not that great. If you want small plates, Good Food on Montford, Dandelion Market and Heist Brewery are all better. This place is very popular with hipsters and yuppies alike, so maybe this is the kind of place where people like to go just to say they did. Or maybe I'm just too old and lame to understand the hype. But either way, we enjoyed our evening but not enough to go back again. There are better options."}
{"text":"Warning: Awesome Place for a Date!!!   Honestly, if you have an adventurous pallet and don't want the normal fair one night then you HAVE to try Soul.  Anyone that gives this place less than 4 stars is downright out of their mind!  I am extremely picky about the freshness of food, ambiance, pleasantness of staff, and pricing of food.  Soul's staff is always a pleasure to speak with and of the 5-6x I have been there, each meal has been nothing short of excellent!  If you do not try Soul Gastrolounge then you are really missing out!"}
{"text":"all of the tapas we ordered were great. the highlights were the veal shortribs, lamb chops and tuna tacos. and don't miss their desserts, especially their pistachio and goat cheese ice cream. definitely a must-go restaurant when in charlotte."}
{"text":"Over promise and under deliver. They're resting on their laurels. Save your money and eat at somewhere with better food."}
{"text":"A true hidden gem... Well, hidden as far as its location but a DEFINITE staple and favorite of Charlotte's locals!  Picture this: 1) Dimmed lighting that sets a classy-casual vibe mixed with random eclectic decor, such as a giant peacock embracing the brick walls with its luscious feathers  2) Hungry Charlotte-ans filled with laughter as they line up by the bar, drinking and chit-chattering away as they WILLINGLY wait hours for a table 3) Visiting guests who are embodied with anticipation as their minds are brainwashed by locals about how amazing the food is 4) Eager faces and watering mouths as tapas are slowly brought out to their owners  yummm.. makes me drool just reminiscing about the experience and especially my meal! Absolutely everything we ordered had an extra kick or zing that took me by surprise. Every \"normal\" dish offered, or so it was described, had an unexpected twist of flavors.  We ordered Wild Mushrooms On Toast (Panini), Ahi Tuna with Sesame & Soy Drizzle (Skewers), Sashimi Tuna Tacos (Tapas-Meze-Small Plates), Sticky Veal Short Ribs (Tapas-Meze-Small Plates), Soul Roll (Sushi: Soul Originals), Goat Cheese Ice Cream and Pistachio Ice Cream (Soul Made Ice Cream). All this for two little girls who, by the way, finished every last bite! In parentheses are the categories of each item. I would recommend any and all of these dishes, but my absolute favorite is the Sticky Veal Short Ribs! These were the most amazing short ribs I have ever had! The meat was so tender and the flavors oh so rich. The meat slid off the bone with ease and every bite was drenched with flavors!  Aside from the amazing short ribs, I have to say that Soul houses the best Pistachio Ice Cream.. IN THE WORLD! The entire meal was absolutely divine. I can't wait to come back!  TIP: It's located upstairs, above a boutique, and can easily be missed if it's your first time. Be on the look out!"}
{"text":"Most unique restaurant in Charlotte! I came here last night and had an excellent experience. There is a long wait but we used the app the staff recommended and overall the experience was worth it. Great service from the moment we walked into the building. We had the tuna tacos, a mixed vegetable salad, watermelon pork belly tacos, bone marrow, lamb lollipops, and the cupcake. We witnessed a family waiting next to us react very rudely to the staff over waiting a long time for their table... . I think the trick to this place is to put your name on the wait list and go explore other places like the new brewery Resident Culture. We will return again like always because we are never disappointed by Soul Gastrolounge!"}
{"text":"The shrimp ceviche in coconut milk was AMAZING. I was not a fan of the fried meatballs or the fried oysters BUT the pork belly tacos were SO good it made up for it. Server was nice too. Cool little spot."}
{"text":"One of the best foodie restaurants in Charlotte. Relaxing atmosphere and outstanding eats. Extremely skilled kitchen."}
{"text":"Willing to give it another shot, but not impressed with the sushi.  I like the vibe, small but trendy. Great drinks.  Just was less than impressed with the roll and I had the soul special. I admit, I'm a bit of a sushi snobb.....but that doesn't mean I believe a good roll has to burn a hole in my pocket. No, I love the dive sushi joints that are actually good.  Overall not impressed."}
{"text":"Ohhhhhh, ScottWeaver, I believe you can get me through the night.... ohhhhhScottWeaver, I believe we can reach the morning light...  I was out running around and my friend called me, brinnnnng, brinnnnng, (that's my cell phone ringing, but really when she calls me it's Another One Bites the Dust) do you want to meet me at Customshop?  Why yes..  We meet there and she is out in the street telling me they are out of vodka.  Sunday brunch, out of vodka, what a travesty.   So we head to Soul, I have heard great things about Soul, but I wondered if the hipsters would kick us out of their club or would the servers be hipper than thou, boy, did I have them pegged all wrong.  Everyone was really nice, food was spectacular and they have great hand made cocktails.  We had bloody marys, my friend ordered chicken and waffles and I ordered an egg and bacon biscuit.  The hit of the day was the cast iron skillet of pimento cheese mac & cheese and of course,  the DJ,Scott Weaver playing great music."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!! Service was great as well. The waiting time is ridiculous, but you can wait downstairs and get some wine. Do not order the bottle as I learned a small bottle(3 glasses) will cost more than buying 3 glasses separately. Check the size first. Pork with watermelon, coconut shrimp and flat bread were my favorites."}
{"text":"Awesome place! I love the unusual things about this place! It could be bigger because they are becoming more popular! Only thing is I was in the middle of writing this review and noticed everyone around us received their food before us when we say down before everyone. The food here is awesome but I do not like the inconsistency of the delivery!"}
{"text":"Great tuna tacos and skewers! The fried Brussels were over fried and not good. The drinks were delicious and very nicely presented. Service a bit slow but friendly."}
{"text":"I haven't been to many tapas bars, so I can't give too deep of a review comparing it to others, so take my enthusiasm with a grain of salt in that regard, but I will say that my fiancee and I LOVED Soul. Every item we tried was superb and the choices let us explore a variety of tastes.  The atmosphere is very dark and cozy, as you'll often be mere feet away from the diners around you. However the servers are very attentive and tended to any need we had. Try the Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos. They are AMAZING and unlike anything we had tried before."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite places to eat!    Interior: A+ (although sometimes I wish it was a bit bigger!) Food: A++++++++++++! Can't go wrong with ANYTHING on the menu! My normal menu consists of: sashimi tuna tacos (OMG!), shrimp or tuna skewers, grilled caesar, & sushi fondue. AMAZING!  Drinks: A++++++! Brian is an awesome bartender!  Staff is friendly & attentive.  Water glasses stay filled.  Music is always on point!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  Relaxing, amazing food and a great atmosphere.  I always have a good time when I come and the food just get better and better every time.  The pork belly tacos are a must have. The staff is amazing.  You can't go wrong with anything you order. This place is just wonderful all around."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious from the cheese plate to the sushi. Super hipster but the food is to die for. Good sized portions for tapas style.The best restaurant I have tried while working down here in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Outstanding!!! My wife and I love trying out new places and this was recommended by a friend. It did not disappoint. The cucumber mule drink is the best I've ever had. The pork Belly tacos will keep you coming back. Service is outstanding. There is always a wait but it is so worth it. We met a couple who waited 2 hours and they were more than happy too. We cant wait to go back again"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my wife... Recommend to get here early... Sitting filled up quickly. Our waitress was great, checked in on us often and had great recommendations. Food came out fast and everything was delicious."}
{"text":"I'd give this place 3 and a half stars if I could, but I can't, so here you have it.  Look - the food at Soul is really quite good.  Loads of variety, and well made and presented.  I haven't had anything here yet that I wasn't impressed by.  The cocktails are better than the food, if that's possible.  Knowledgeable barstaff make great drinks, and relatively quickly, too.  Sounds like a 5 star review, right?  Well, the thing that kills Soul is that it's gotten too popular for its own good.  There is always -- ALWAYS -- a wait to be seated, and they don't take reservations, which really grinds my gears.  If you want to sit down to a meal at night, the DJ is often playing too loud for you to have good conversation with your dinner company, and you'll likely spend a fair bit of coin to order enough small plates to make it a real meal.  Maybe a 45 minute wait to sit down and eat appeals to some people - maybe it makes you feel like you're in New York, or that you're experiencing something truly special, or it gives your visit some sense of occasion.  For me, it makes me wonder why I'm not giving my time and money to any number of other really great food places within a quick walk, bike, or drive of Soul."}
{"text":"Beyond what I expected . It's always great to be in such cultural diverse surroundings and be able to put that diversity to your on your menu . The food was beyond awesome and the service was phenomenal..... Try it .. s/n the music was wonderful as well. I'll be going back"}
{"text":"Great place, enough said! First, a bit of advice: be prepared to wait for a while for a table on a Friday or Saturday night, and by a while I mean 1.5-2 hours. The atmosphere is very hip, and the patio/balcony dining space was really interesting. The crowd was younger, which made the experience very fun and energetic.  Regardless, the food is definitely worth the wait. We had a sashimi tuna taco, slow-cooked ribs, grilled chicken skewer, and a tuna sushi roll. I would describe the food as the best of East meets West. Especially the ribs and chicken skewer-- the presentation, the taste, dressings, and sauces reminded me a lot of Japan, where every detail matters. So much so that I kept saying the owner's must have lived in Japan for a while, but it turns out the owner is Greek...I was way off!  I would highly recommend the tapas over the sushi. The sushi's really just mediocre."}
{"text":"After just getting back from NYC and eating some fantastic food... of course.  I was still craving the cuisine you can find on every street in NYC.  That being said I adventured back to Soul.  I hadn't been in a very long time and things have changed for the better the menu has a lot more variety now and lots of sushi.    I highly recommend the pan con tomate & pork belly tacos truly fantastic.  The sushi was a nice surprise fresh and tasty.  Ahh the drinks also bring me back to a little mid-town at $10 a pop the prices are almost equal as well but the drinks are well worth the cost.  This by far has been one of my favorite meals out in the last 4 years living in Charlotte.  Tip this place gets packed so be prepared to wait.  It's well worth it."}
{"text":"Soul is great for dates or dinner with friends.  The small plates and sushi (Dancing Tuna roll!!!!!!!!!) are delicious and the atmosphere is fun.  The cocktails are interesting (expensive), but I can't fault a place with Moscow mules on tap.  Be prepared to wait awhile, like hours, but they do have a waitlist app (not sure what it's called), where you can sign in and put your party's name down, and will continue to update you on how many parties are in front of you. If you utilize this, then just go over to a Plaza Midwood bar and hang while you wait!"}
{"text":"Goodness, Soul. You make Tapas and Gastronoms fall in love so easily.   There are quite a few things worth trying:   Brunch: On Sundays. Best Greek Yogurt with honey I've ever had. Perfect and pretty sure its made in house?   Soul Roll: The spicy mayo and jalepe√±o give it a nice kick and salmon is bangin.   LAMB LOLLIPOPS: If you don't get these, you're a fool. (Unless you're a veg) Perfectly cooked, french cut (lollipop style) and served with amazing pecorino. Worth the cash you'll have to drop. Every time.   Cheese Plate: Good for sharing. Nice assortment. Manchego is fantastic.   FRIED CHEESE: Not sure if this is always on the menu, but if it is you'll be hard pressed to stop eating it hand over fist. Amazing.   Paninis: Mini Burgers, Mushrooms on toast and the Cubanini are my favs. Definitely a good go-to if you're in a pinch.   Dip Trio: tzatziki, hummus, babaganoush  are all great and interesting.   The only cons I can think of is getting a seat. Put your name in, head down to 22 for a beer and chill if it's a nice night. You can always try and squeeze in at the bar. Definitely get the same experience and can sometimes be faster on a busy night.   Love Soul. Places like this make Charlotte more unique. The dining experience is different every time and there always seems to be something new to try. Culinarily daring, busy as all get out and worth every penny."}
{"text":"We ate here on a Friday night - when we used the no wait app before we arrived there were 21 parties ahead of us and although the app said 105 min wait we were seated within 45 minutes. We tried the meatballs, Brussel sprouts, red dragon roll and spider roll. Each exceeded our expectations and were delicious! We were satisfied with everything we tried.   The only down sides were parking was really hard to find and our server didn't check in with us often even though we waited a good 35-40 mins after we ordered for our main dish to come."}
{"text":"Great food, great service & great selection. This is a cool hip fun place to hang out and have a few cocktails and eat. I love the fact that they're open every day till 2 AM and have music. I highly suggest going here on a date or just to hang out with friends. It gets extremely crowded so you might want to make a reservation."}
{"text":"I am originally from Charlotte, and was back in town visiting family and friends and a friend of mine suggested meeting here for tapas and drinks this evening.  I could not wait to write this review.  I have not encountered such poor customer service in a very long time, and that's saying something, as I currently live in New York City.  The hostess who \"greeted\" me was incredibly rude.  I use the word \"greeted\" very freely.  Basically, she looked me up and down expectantly as I walked in the door.  When I said nothing, obviously expecting a \"Hello\" or a \"Welcome\", she proceeded to sigh and grunt out a \"How many?\"  When I explained to her that I was meeting someone and pulled out my phone to text my friend to ask her if she wanted to sit inside or out, I was told, very rudely and abruptly, that the restaurant was \"obviously very small\" and that she would not seat me  until my party was complete.  Fine.  I understand that many restaurants have this policy.  I was making no complaint.  There's no need for such an attitude.  A bit taken aback by her demeanor, I asked if I could wait at the bar, towards which I was waved with a scowl.  When my friend finally arrived, I tried to settle up with the bartender (for a single seltzer), and he said it was no problem and not to worry about it.  When we approached the hostess to claim a table, she looked at me very accusingly and said, \"Well did you settle your bar tab?\"    I've worked retail, I've worked food service - I know people have bad days, I know these jobs can really suck sometimes, but there is no excuse for attitude like that.  Especially when I did nothing to provoke it.  The waitress was competent, but not particularly friendly or helpful in the slightest.  Food was fine, nothing incredible.  And the red velvet cupcake was dry and infinitely forgettable.  I think the management and staff here should seriously rethink their approach to customer service.  Treat your customers well - they're the one and only reason that you're in business.  I will never, EVER come back here.  And I will never recommend this establishment to anyone."}
{"text":"3 words: Pork Belly Tacos. Just do it. You won't be sorry!!!!!!!! There was truly a party in my mouth after eating them. Couldn't stop thinking about how amazing they tasted. Such a cool, fun & funky vibe in this tiny (too tiny) 2nd floor spot. Just order 4 or 5 things & split them all. Or not since they're tapas. Their wknd brunch is awesome too. I had a breakfast panini, which was absolutely amazing...berries & cream cheese...who doesn't love that all melty & gooey goodness?"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic and very fresh. I recommend getting one of their signature cocktails, all made from scratch. Their menu has a unique offering of both Asian and new age for your pallet that will leave you wanting to come back again. I am glad I gave this place a shot because it's Off the beaten path and worth the hike (up the stairs)!"}
{"text":"We stopped in Charlotte for a night on the way back to NYC and were excited to try this restaurant based on all the amazing reviews. When we first got there, we were intrigued by the decor and atmosphere and didn't mind the wait (initially told it was going to be up to 1.5 hours, but that it could be much shorter). We left our phone number with the host and went to the bar next door for a drink. 45 minutes later, we called to check on our reservation and were told that they supposedly texted us 10 minutes prior as our table was ready (we did not get any texts). Either way, we came back and were promptly seated...albeit with only one menu for the four of us (I had to grab one myself from another table). This is when things really started going downhill, which is a shame because most of the food was pretty good.  We all ordered drinks, but only two eventually arrived. We had to remind about the other two 20 minutes later when we realized nothing else was on its way. Then they continued to randomly bring out our tapas dishes without any thought to the order and with very long breaks in between. One of us didn't get any of her four orders for over 30 mins and had to watch others eat. There were two orders of grilled cheese and they came out 45 minutes apart after we inquired about the second one. They completely forgot a dish until we inquired about it at the end of our meal. Bone marrow was undercooked (they comped it on the bill without us saying anything about it, so we assume they knew). Our main waiter didn't remember anything any of us ordered and some orders were getting brought over by different people. Worst of all, we didn't receive much of an apology throughout the ordeal. All we got was a  dismissive \"it's that kind of night.\"  This is a real shame because this is a unique restaurant and lamb lollipops, sashimi, and tuna tacos were great. I recommend the bone marrow or the grilled cheese. But at these prices, this type of service is really unacceptable at an establishment that has been open for a while and has had time to work out the kinks."}
{"text":"This. Place. Is. Legit.. Seriously, I was in town for business, sat at the bar, and had an awesome experience. I went with the bartenders recommendation on three dishes- pork belly watermelon tacos, ahi tuna tacos served in homemade wonton shells, and hamachi tuna sashimi platter. Whoa. Completely dominated most Asian places I've been and does so with a totally chill laid back hipsterish vibe- exposed wood ceilings, chill music, cool people. Its location is up a random metal staircase  on a corner of a kinda weird area so you won't stumble upon it- you gotta know its there. And it's there. And it's spectacular. The only bias here for me is I'm greek and so is an owner- even though I didn't get anything greek there are a ton of Greece influenced dishes onthe menu- when I come back next quarter I can't wait to try them."}
{"text":"I was a non sup believer. But this place has earned my business back. Anchovy fries are worth a try! Moscow mules are the best in all of Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Had a great mix of a meal at Soul - from sushi to pork belly shells and cheese, and everything in between. They don't take reservations and the restaurant is small, but it is worth the wait and the cocktails are good and strong, so grab one while you wait for a table. It's best to go with someone who has similar tastes in food so that you can order together and try bits of everything. I recommend the fried brussels sprouts, shells and cheese with bbq glazed pork belly, and the red dragon roll. I also had the Asian glazed pork belly tacos (which is one of their top sellers) - great flavor and outer crispiness to the pork belly. I tried the fried cheese goat cheese on bruschetta but could live without getting that again.  Nice service, as well. They warn you when you sit down, but the tapas come out as they're ready - not all at once - to keep everything fresh."}
{"text":"When it comes to edgy culinary experiences in a unique setting, Soul has been on the top of my Charlotte list for quite some time. I'll start off by saying the atmosphere is not for everyone. It's a small space where the tables are extremely close to one another it can be noisy. If you are willing to embrace the resulting conversations and meeting new people, then you also get the benefit of trying some of my favorite dishes and cocktails that the city of Charlotte has to offer.   Again, the space is small and they don't take reservations. Getting large crowds (4+) in is extremely difficult. While the no wait app has been a game changer, this place puts up ridiculous wait times so be prepared to go early. I also recommend trying one of the specialty cocktails here. Several big names in the Charlotte cocktail scene either started here or spent some time here. While I'm not sure who influenced who, I'll certainly enjoy the resulting drink menu they have to offer.   Regarding food, I've tried many dishes over the last few years and only have had a handful that didn't blow me away. I would treat this place as an experience more than a meal, and have easily spent close to 2 hours in the past ordering dishes (1) or (2) at a time and often putting my experience in the hands of our waiter/waitress as they are better versed in what is good for the night. Some highlights include the pork belly tacos, sashimi tuna tacos, and garlic truffle fries. Since the small plates can add up quick on my bill, I normally round out the night with a sushi roll as they tend to have more bang for your buck calorie to dollar wise."}
{"text":"Have lived in Charlotte for almost a year, and have take a personal (if not misguided) initiative to eat in as many spots as I can.  Soul Gastrolounge has the best food I've had so far.  First of all, the atmosphere is killer.  Dive bar meets hipster meets club meets food truck meets I don't know what else.  It's edgy and comfortable all at the same time.  But the food.  Shared several rounds of small plates with a friend.  Pork belly tacos, pan con tomate, ahi tacos, some sort of bacon cream corn that fell from heaven, sushi that made me cry.  At some point we had dessert.  I could describe how they tasted, but I think I'll just stop and enjoy the memory again.  And plan my next trip."}
{"text":"It was good but I would not say oozing with character. No complaints about any particular items. Would go regularly for drinks and appetizers if we lived closer but would not make a point to drive from 30 minutes away with so many other restaurants to try in a city new to us.   Menu has a lot of sushi, which we didn't try. The pork belly items were great. The mix of food is intentionally diverse but could benefit from more focus IMHO."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here NEARLY as much as I would like.  But the times I have have all been amazing.    Stranded in midwood one night soon after soul's opening, I met up with some friends who were going there for dinner.  Since my only other choice was to sit alone at common market, I followed them, and I was not sorry.  I had one of their sushi rolls...which roll it was is lost in the mist of time and many killed brain cells.  I do remember that it was a little spicy, a little creamy, a little crunchy, and I DEVOURED it.    I wasn't able to return until almost 4 years later, but I watched the twitter feed and my mouth watered at every special they posted.  Finally I was able to go there for brunch.  We shared the truffle fries which were amazing.  I don't know if they come with a dipping sauce, but we didn't get one, and we didn't need one.  I had the chicken and waffles and I once again devoured every bit.  It was also very reasonably priced for the amount of food.  I got a mimosa but I wish I had gotten a bloody mary because my friend's was delicious and came with all sorts of pickled goodies.    Oh, also, they put a cucumber slice in the water, which is like a double boost of hydration for those of us who may or may not be - ahem - dehydrated from the night before.  Soul, I love you!!!"}
{"text":"Have been to Soul countless times and always have a fantastic experience. The cocktails are great, and the food is even better. Definitely our favorite restaurant in Charlotte. The menu changes a fair bit, but unlike most places, I never have trouble finding several things I like.   If you haven't tried the pork belly watermelon tacos - they will change your life. Do. Not. Miss. Them.  Remember - they don't take reservations, and there is almost always a 1-2 hour wait. The pro move is to put your name in with the hostess (or use the NoWait app to get on the list), and then go across the street to Peculiar Rabbit or Workman's Friend for a drink while you wait for your name to be called."}
{"text":"Just had another amazing soul experience. Our waiter Jamie was on point, engaging and friendly. Every I'm in Charlotte I make an excuse to to hit up soul. Great tapas, drinks and musk every time."}
{"text":"Soul has a very music vibe with upbeat music an extensive menu and creative drinks. The truffle fries are awesome and their entire sushi menu is great! Will definitely be coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"Run, do not walk to this place for some great small plates and delicious drinks.  We started with sushi, which was so fresh and simple.  Then moved onto the pork bell tacos, so good my mouth is watering thinking about them.. Perfect combo of salty, Asian glazed pork with sweet watermelon. The Korean BBQ wings were next, and if I wasn't already looking forward to dessert I would have ordered more.  Sweet potato cupcake with a marshmallow topping that could have easily been the best dessert I have ever had. It was the perfect blend of salty and sweet and I hope I can figure out  way to re-create it.  Top the food with excellent service, I will be back!"}
{"text":"LEGIT!  Friends in Charlotte raves about this place, I can see why! We put our names down early (6:30pm)  for a party of 6 but there was still a long wait. Grabbed some beers downstairs at Twenty- two in the meantime.   There seems to be only 3 booths that can fit bigger parties. They decided to take their sweet time with the bill, so we ordered some cucumber mule at the bar. I love it when mules are served in copper mugs which really brings out the refreshingness of the drink.   As usual, we did family style and shared: southern fried wings, truffle fries, Asian glazed pork belly tacos, sashimi tuna tacos, lamb lollipops, dirty south nachos, and special roll with coconut shrimp and tuna.   The pork belly tacos were out of this world!!! Every juicy bite was paired equally with a piece of pork belly and watermelon. The sweet and savory combo  was wonderful. The lamb lollipops were cooked to perfection as well. Everything else was pretty good as well, I'd pass on the dirty south nachos though.   TLDR: expect a long wait, get cucumber mule, Asian glazed pork belly tacos, and lamb lollipops."}
{"text":"Killer drinks. Good sushi and tapas. No reservations. Long wait expected.  Bartenders are great here. You will always have a wait and they don't do open table or reservations. So if you have somewhere to be after dinner, might not be the best choice.   However, the tapas style menu is really good. Most things are meant to share.   My faves include -   The lamb lollipops The soul roll   Park in the bistro la Bon parking lot but NOT in the cvs parking. They tow.   Have the bartender make you a CORPSE REVIVER NO. 2 with a splash of Absinthe.. so good.  1 oz. gin 1 oz. Cocchi Americano or Lillet Blanc 1 oz. Cointreau 1 oz. fresh lemon juice 1 dash absinthe Orange peel, for garnish"}
{"text":"Everytime I come here I prepare for a long wait or slow service. I get very confused on who the waitresses are aside from customers. The food is a little pricey, but definetly delish! I don't think anything really comes with sides. But a must try is the ramen noodle bowl! Soooo yummy! The vibe is definetly the best part about this place, no doubt."}
{"text":"Where oh where do I begin with this place? To begin with the amazing food? Or no, maybe the awesome vibes. Possibly even the super cool staff. I'm seriously lost y'all hahah. Oh well, let's take this logically from the start!   Walking into Soul kind of like walking into this darkly lit rustic speakeasy with a trendy twist to it all. It's old school with a touch of contemporary. The seating inside makes for a great date night setting or a fun night out with a good group of friends. There's outdoor seating on the patio as well which is what my girlfriend and I did. The weather was perfect and it had a nice bustle out there which was much appreciated. To complement this unique setting is the staff - everyone with their own unique personality and equally amazing. Our waiter was super fun and had great recommendations for us on not just food at Soul but also in the Charlotte area. And for a Yelper/ Foodie like me, I thrive off local recommendations. we genuinely enjoyed his company, so much so we held him in conversation and stopped him from even getting to his other tables. Oops?   On to the food! And I'm gonna get straight to the point. Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos. They are everything. That is all.   No but seriously just get them because you won't regret it one bit. The flavoring was a perfect tangy sweet and sour and the watermelon added a very interesting touch to the profile.  I'm not that big of a pork belly fan to begin with so y'all I'm serious haha. I also had the Tuna tacos which were also great and my girlfriend had the flatbread which she thoroughly enjoyed. As for the drinks and cocktails - very well made and crafted with attention to detail. They're a little pricey but totally worth it. Try the Sidecar Named Desire!   I'll definitely be going back soon to try the rest of the fantastic menu - I got my eyes on those short ribs!"}
{"text":"I'm often asked by friends and fellow yelpers, \"what's a place I should try?\" Or, \"what's your favorite restaurant?\"  The answer I always unflinchingly give is Soul Gastrolounge. With that, here's everything you need to know Soul...  1. LOONG WAIT. The wait to get a table can be long. Very long.  I mean its pretty simple, do NOT go to Soul on Thursday or Friday night and expect to get in and out within 2hrs.  Therefore, I only go to Soul on Tuesdays or Wednesdays.  Oh, and they don't accept reservations.  2.  NO LUNCH.  That's right, Soul doesn't open until 5pm.  I usually try to get there a little later in the evening; usually after the main dinner rush, around 9pm or so.    3.  DJs & Tunes! I'm not 100% sure, but I believe they have a DJ on hand Thursday - Saturday nights starting around 9pm.  The DJ's are always on point with the music and really add to Soul's trendy vibe and reputation it has around Charlotte.    4. NO PARKING.  There's no parking lot, or area exclusively for Soul's patrons.  Your best bet is to park in the lot across the street near CVS (sometimes its $5), or anywhere else around the heart of Plaza Midwood (near Thomas Street Tavern/Whiskey Warehouse) and walking over.   5. The FOOD IS AMAZING!!!!  Although I've tried many items on the menu from the pork belly sliders, to the steak and eggs which both make my mouth water, my favorite item is the Sakana Roll.  Its a tuna, salmon, avocado, sushi roll lightly fried - simply the best sushi in Charlotte!  If sushi's not your thing, don't worry there's plenty of great menu items as I said the steak and eggs or any of the skewers are great.  The humus of the day and guac stack are both great tasting, lighter options.  The french fries w/truffle oil are out of this world yummy!!   6. HIP. COOL. VIBE.  I like Soul's ambiance so much because its the perfect representation of the people and culture of Plaza-Midwood and Charlotte as a whole.  Its young, hip, chill, and different.  Everything from the walk up the black steps, to the dark interior, to the tight bar, to the blue peacock hanging behind that same bar; create a happening, mellow vibe thats unmistakeable.    Soul perfectly in-captures everything I value in a dining experience. From the amazing and unique food, to the trendy ambiance, to the phenomenal service - everything pops at Soul.  Soul, what a great name for an establishment that truly represents the heart and soul of the Queen City."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and each time was outstanding. I would suggest being patient (very) as far as getting a table. This is a very small intimate spot with a lot of demand. The truffle fries aren't to be missed. Their desserts are quite inventive as well. I would be careful about getting to caught up in the \"small plates/bites\" menu, however. You can end up leaving with a big tab."}
{"text":"A little over rated if you ask me, but not a bad place to grab some interesting small plates."}
{"text":"Had a \"Top 5 Worst Restaurant Experiences Ever\" at Soul last weekend during a trip to Charlotte.    Arrive around 6:30 PM on Saturday night, put our names in with the hostess.  30-45 minute wait expected.  OK, no problem.  Head downstairs and enjoy a nice brew and a chat.  Go back up to check on things after 50 minutes.  Next 2 person table that comes free is ours!  Alright!    Wait around near the hostess station for 30 more minutes.  See 2 tables come free about the same time.  Hostess proceeds to push the 2 2-person tables together to make a nice seat for 4.  Oh no!    Approach hostess to inquire.  She has a table ready for us.  OK, all is forgiven.   We're shown to our \"table\", which looks a lot like two seats at the bar.  In fact, it is two seats at the bar.    Silly Soul Gastrolounge!  If we had desired seats at the bar, we would have gone ahead and taken them 2 hours ago.  Needless to say, we got up and left immediately and won't ever go back.  Doesn't matter if they are serving up gigantic platters of Ambrosia plucked from God's own orchards, no food on earth is good enough for that kind of service.   We went down the road to Fern and were treated to a delicious meal with excellent service.  Go there instead, people."}
{"text":"Other than the 1.5 hour wait this was by far the best restaurant we have been to in Charlotte. The host stand team was amazing, the bar made fantastic drinks and our server Drew was outstanding! The food was out of this world, the Brussel sprouts were hands down the best I've ever had. The beef skewers and the BBQ stuffed shells were so rich and flavorful. Even the salad was great! Amazing job, we will be back!!"}
{"text":"A few friends and I visited Soul on a Saturday night out on Central Ave.  Most of the reviews for this establishment speak to the service and food- and on this particular night, both were excellent. It helps that \"Rock with You\" was playing as we walked in...  Yes, the indoor volume could be 40-50 dB lower but I dont talk a whole lot and so this didnt bother me terribly. Our server was very patient and attentive without being officious. The eats were tasty and plate sizes were sufficient, read \"UNAMERICAN.\" The portions are not the most generous but appropriate  for tapas. Cab was quite amazing: a hearty pour in a wine tumbler- I like your style Soul.   Won't be dying to go back, especially on a busy night, but I live nearby so I am inclined to REvisit on the slow and easy."}
{"text":"Food was incredible, and the drinks were even better. I highly recommend the pork belly and watermelon tacos, ahi tuna tacos, and fresh sashimi.  Cocktail of choice: Dill with it. AMAZING! Will be back for sure.  Tip: If you'd like to hear your dinner partner do not go on Friday or Saturday night. They have a DJ that plays entirely too loud of music if you even want to call it that.   Follow me @jodieats"}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat and drink in Charlotte! Food is fantastic and drinks are delicious. Be sure to try the pork belly tacos. You won't be disappointed! Only downside is this place fills up fast and doesn't do reservations. Make sure you show up early or the wait can be 2 hours, totally worth it though. Happy eating! :)"}
{"text":"First of all the food here is awesome. We had a honey humus which we though might be interesting..it was delicious. Pork skewers with the BBQ glaze...jut get them. On the other hand I like to go to a place for the complete experience...our waitress was great and maybe we were there at a weird time but the porch seemed to be filled with chain smokers who's vocabulary contained the f word every other word that came out. Really hindered our experience unfortunately."}
{"text":"Soul is a trendy night spot in the heart of Plaza Midwood. Trundle up the stairs to the patio... and enjoy the beautiful view of Charlotte's skyline!  You can sit out on the balcony, inside lounge style on sofas, or at tables.  The wait staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Ask what they recommend for some interesting suggestions.  We have been several times, and never been dissapointed. Consistency is sometimes tough for a restaurant, and I am happy to say that each meal has been wonderful.  The lamb lollipops....All I can say is, you will need more than one order. They are fabulous...maybe the best lamb I've ever had. Seasoned perfectly, cooked to a succulent medium rare...They are beautiful.   Some other dishes we have tried: White bean and goat cheese dip...very very good spinach and phyllo....good Littleneck clams...excellent lamb lollipops.....Must have!! Hoisin Veal shortribs...excellent Bone marrow....very nice change from the usual! Cheese plate..good Sashimi tuna taco....excellent!!! Shrimp ceviche....excellent!!!  They also serve sparkling saki....which I had never had before. It is sweet saki and just delightful!   The decor and atmosphere are nice too...dark, but not too dark. There is a stuffed peacock on the wall that I am just fascinated with!! I want it for my den!!  Enjoy Soul...it really is an interesting change of pace here in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I came to Soul on a Saturday night at 8PM with three other ladies.  We knew they did not take reservations and were expecting a wait.  We were quoted 1.5 hours and decided to have some drinks at the bar.  The bar service was great.  After 1.5 hours of waiting I checked in with the hostess and she said there were four other groups in front of us.  A little after a 2 hour wait we got our table.  If the hostess had any thought of us waiting over 1.5 hours she should've quoted us that.  Honestly, that is the only huge negative thing I have to say about this restaurant.    Now, onto dinner.  The menu has a little bit of everything ranging from Greek to Asian to American food.  We ordered a lot of different things, but I will only list my favorites: the lamb lollipops, the Soul Roll, the pork belly tacos, and the brussel sprouts.  The server at our table was fast and attentive.  We did order dessert and I do not recommend the cupcake or the pistashio ice cream.  The cupcake was dry and the ice cream wasn't cold, yet it was solid.  Weird.    Overall, expect a long wait and a delicious meal, but please skip dessert."}
{"text":"I gave 3 due to the extremely nice staff and great enviroment. But i wasnt to thrilled about the food. I ordered the stuffed shells and the fried oysters. I wont be ordering that again."}
{"text":"As always when I come home to visit my folks in Charlotte I am faced with the dilemma of finding restaurants to eat out at that not only tease my palate with some new flavors but also manage to not scare them off in the process. It's usually just my mom dining with me, so that relieves some of the pressure of pleasing all 3 of us, which is truly an unenviable task. This time around I solicited the feedback of a few fellow Yelpers in Charlotte for some new places and decided Soul Gastrolounge offered up so many options on their menu that surely I could find something to satisfy us both.  It seemed to me that most of the complaints people had with this place revolved around the wait to get in, or just poor service in general, but I can definitely assure you we had neither of these problems (although mom likes to eat dinner early, so we got there a little after 6PM). In fact our server Marlon was one of the most attentive I've ever had, and constantly updated us on the progress of our items, since we ordered so many different plates. The pace of the food was all done well, and only at one point was our table completely overflowing with dishes, to which we just stole some space from the one next to us for a few minutes. All of the drinks came out within just a few minutes of ordering as well. Maybe we just got lucky, but this service was on point the whole night.  At first glance the huge menu here seems to be a total mishmash of things from all over the globe, prepared in every way imaginable, the kind of thing that Gordon Ramsay would come into a restaurant and blow a gasket over. After a little further examination though you can see some of the connections, although I still think they should do away with a few sections altogether and focus more on the remaining dishes. The pricing of everything here (with the exception of the $18 lamb lollipops) is all pretty fair though, so you can try just about anything on the menu without a huge investment, a nice departure from the \"small plate\" pricing schemes in DC.  We began with their spicy feta dip, which had a nice thick texture but I couldn't get past the strong Pimento cheese flavor, something that quickly reminded me I was back in NC. I did like it, but not sure I would recommend it. Next out were the Boursin cheese stuffed piquillo peppers served over mini-bruschettas. The flavors here were a bit muted for me, something my mom was a fan of, but I guess that's due to my inexperience with piquillos and expecting them to be spicy rather than sweet. So, if that's more your style then this dish is definitely done properly. The last of our teaser bites was easily my favorite, the French fries with garlic-herb salt and truffle oil, and we wound up snacking on them throughout the whole meal as a nice base point for flavors when we wanted to alternate back and forth. The truffle presence is pretty potent here but the herb flavors do a good job balancing it...definitely request some of the spicy mayo for dipping!  Our first meat dish to come out was the chimichurri beef skewers, really well cooked cubes of beef with a hint of pink and a side of dipping sauce. Thankfully the chimichurri was for dipping, because it was a big disappointment compared to other versions I've had, but at least the meat was good. The sticky veal shortribs with the five spice honey glaze though were superb. The meat falls right off the bone as it should and maintains tenderness throughout. I really loved the traditional Asian flavor combo of hoisin and five spice here too. The lamb lollipops are clearly the star of the show here, although I wish the rosemary flavor was a bit more pronounced...and I hardly ever say this, but they cooked have been cooked just a bit longer to get a nice sear on the outside.  My favorite dish came next, the pork belly tacos with watermelon salsa. We were worried they wouldn't be available, as our waiter told us there was currently a watermelon shortage, but someone managed to find some and deliver it to the restaurant just in time, whew. Glad they did, as this was a unique flavor combination for me that really worked brilliantly. The high didn't last long though, as I was thoroughly disappointed with the shrimp ceviche, mainly due to the coconut milk base which was entirely too sweet.  Dessert was a mixed bag, with the eggnog cupcake being OK, thanks in part to a heavy dose of rum-spiked frosting, and the pistachio ice cream being much better. There are nice big pieces of whole pistachios mixed into the ice cream which not only enhanced the flavor but added a nice textural element.  I really appreciated the effort they're putting into the cocktail menu here as well. At just $10 a piece you can get some pretty creative combinations, such as the Dark N' Spicy using dark rum, ginger liqueur, Saranac ginger beer and fresh lime juice, much better than the \"Stormy\" version. Basil Smash was also good, but the Sweet Heat had too much syrup and not enough kick."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here.  Each small serving was tasty.   Good selection of specialty cocktails and some bottled beers.   Restaurant seems better suited for parties of 4 or less.   We arrived at 7PM and by 8, the place was packed."}
{"text":"Great stop while en route to the Caribbean for our honeymoon.  We were able to kick off the festivities with some amazing culinary cocktails.  Since they don't accept reservations, we enjoyed a couple on the 2nd floor outdoor patio before heading inside for dinner.  We sat at the sushi bar and shared a variety of tapas.  Would definitely try to go again when in town."}
{"text":"Soul Gastrolounge now has emotional value to me. It's about to get really sappy, sorry in advance.   My boyfriend and I went to Soul Gastrolounge on our first real date, March of 2016. Everything was SEAMLESS. Everything WORKED. Our service was great, server was very attentive and knowledgeable. The ambience was cool and casual, the lighting was perfect. The music and the style was trendy but not super stuck up. The perfect environment for any date night.   Now the food, the most important part of any restaurant review on Yelp. To put it into perspective, this is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte and one of my fave in the US, period. My personal fave are the sashimi tuna tacos and the ceviche. Sooooo yummy! I've tried a bunch of other things on the menu and there has not been one single thing I haven't liked. It's Tapas style and there's something on the menu for every taste I think. Drinks: they're strong, so be careful. I couldn't handle more than 2, these bartenders are generous with the alcohol.   Also, my bf went to eat here alone on his birthday once while I was unfortunately out of town for work. I called the restaurant and asked if they'd let me buy him a drink and dessert and they cooperated in helping me surprise him and let me pay with my card. Pulled it off perfectly. Almost 2 years later we are now a happy couple and Soul Gastrolounge still provides the perfect setting for date night and still delivers on the great food and service. Thank you Soul for orchestrating the perfect first evening for us. This is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte and one of my fave in the U.S. An absolute MUST HAVE while in Queen City."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend, late night. Took FOREVER to get a server to even take our drink order. Once that was taken, it took even longer to put our food order in...and as you can probably guess, it didn't exactly come out on time either...  Aside from all of that, the food was good...not great. Had some skewers, white bean dip, buffalo wings, and the fact that I can't remember what else we ordered probably says a lot...The white bean and goat cheese dip was not that great however, if it had been served hot, it might have been better. It was lukewarm...  We sat outside which was nice (but you definitely knew you were in Charlotte--NOT NY...) There were lots of drunk kids entering and exiting and an extremely inappropriate couple (by couple, I mean something that comes out of a Jersey Shore episode) who may have actually fell over the balcony, together, had they stayed a minute longer...management observed their behavior and said nothing...until they shattered a glass over the balcony.   Even if the food was better, I don't think I'd return. Most uncomfortable experience coupled with poor service= not worth it to me!  Oh, and by the way, a friend of mine tried to book this place for her birthday and the MANAGER told her he couldn't accommodate a reservation for ten--EVER...like, he said he just could not a reserve a table for her...interesting....Why did I still come here after knowing this?! Don't know.  Take your money elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Worth the wait  pork belly tacos"}
{"text":"This is absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in the city. From the towns favorite pork belly tacos to the fresh sushi. Complimented with a refreshing glass of cucumber water. It's heaven!!! My first time ever having a food-gasm was here!! I wouldn't recommend coming here if your super hungry because from experience you can rack up a pretty hefty bill. Great food, amazing service, and awesome atmosphere. Grab your friends and check out the epic always changing and very diverse menu they have to offer. I give my stamp of approval.   Now, on the other hand the wait is ridiculous because of the popularity. They don't rush you to leave but you kinda feel bad because you know how it feels to keep waiting. Well worth the wait though.   Menu favs:  Pork belly tacos Tuna tacos Spider Roll Shrimp skewers  Lamb lollipops Grilled cheese Wings (all flavors) And many more"}
{"text":"Soul may be hard to get into on busy nights, but it's worth the wait. The tapas-style menu features Spanish dishes like chorizo, Greek pitas and dips, some of the best sushi in town, and tons of other fantastic dishes, all served as super-shareable small plates. Come hungry and ready to share. Soul has opened my eyes to dishes I never would have thought I would like - the anchovy fries are now one of my cravings, and I'm not sure where else you can order bone marrow in Charlotte. My favorites are the mini burgers, stuffed piquillo peppers on bruscetta, sticky veal shortribs and replay roll, although not listing the entire menu here is difficult. The bartenders here are also pretty skilled. Great spot choose if trying to impress your foodie friends."}
{"text":"Came here about 2 years ago and probably went back 3 more times in the same month no joke. Now I limit myself to once a year for date night but it's always just as good as the first time. Three favorite things I usually always get is their Fries, Pork Belly Tacos, and the Dirty South Nachos. Tried the shells and cheese this time which was good, just heavy after all the food I ate. Cupcakes are also really good here. They have a great menu so it's hard to go wrong. They don't take reservations beforehand so be prepared to wait, luckily there's places nearby to drink and hang out. Can't wait to go back next year!"}
{"text":"i have been scoping this eclectic dinner spot  in plaza midwood since it's opening and finally went there with a few girlfriends last night.  it's official i am a fan of both it's ambiance and the menu.   an excess of options at first had me a little overwhelmned with what to choose but we ending up starting in with a variety of nibblers the guacamole stack, white bean & goat cheese dip, fried goat cheese on bruschetta and the soul roll (yum)! followed by greek salad, a gyro (a little too different on the seasoning front for my taste) and then on to the cupcake of the day - snickerdoodle, which went over well with the entire group (i'll be honest i was tempted to order another just to take home for later)!  only real is issue with the entire evening as there always seems to be with plaza midwood was where to park, after that dilemna was solved a good time was had by all."}
{"text":"One of my friends was in from out of town so I brought her here.  Everything we had was delicious and the wait wasn't bad at all, we must have come in before the dinner rush.  We ended up trying the fried brussles sprouts, which were delicious. The Saganaki on the menu says it is flamed, but either the girl forgot, or they just don't truely flame it, so was kind of disappointed.  The Fried meatballs which were divine.  And the yellowtail Hamachi melted in my mouth.   The drinks were very tasty as well, they had a granny smith apple cocktail that could be dangerous, as you couldn't taste the alcohol in it, so we ordered two. ;)  In all, loved this place, will definately go back again."}
{"text":"Terrible indescribable bad service. Waited two hours to never be seated. Idiotic manager and hostesses. I had better expectations for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Soul is my favorite place to eat in charlotte. They have great cocktails, the best sushi, and a great location. There is usually a wait but it's easy to put your name on the list and grab a cocktail or walk around plaza. The service is always fun and friendly. Great place for a date or for a group that has various food preferences as they have sushi, veggies, lamb, and dessert."}
{"text":"Loved this place! It was recommended by a friend who lives locally and I will definitely be coming back. The drinks were excellent! I am typically drink an Old Fashioned and enjoyed the Out on Bail.   The shrimp skewers were my favorite, but I'm not a sushi eater. The waitress warned me that the shells and cheese were heavy, but they were still good. Overall, great food, drinks and I loved the chill environment."}
{"text":"Three cheers for this place. Me and my friend went here for her first night out since having her baby a year ago and it was perfect. This place is extremely popular and we knew there would be a wait. We were told an hour and 15 minutes and headed to the bar. We got the tiki taboo and the cucumber mule, both were fantastic. When we were seated we ordered the pork belly tacos, red dragon roll, dancing tuna roll, brussels sprouts, and the fried goat cheese bruschetta. Everything was delicious and I'm so excited to come back again."}
{"text":"A fun hipster spot to enjoy a casual beer at the bar inside, or a meal at one of the wooden booths or outside on the balcony deck.  Ambiance is perfect for meeting up with friends for an evening catch-up with a good menu of small plates that won't leave you hungry.  The pork belly tacos are spectacular.  There are some unexpected things on the menu (rocky mountain oysters) as well as some fun flavors.    I was a little confused on the sushi here as it seemed overly flavored with sauces so the fish doesn't really stand out.  Perhaps a matter of preference, but sushi didn't really fit into the overall theme and feel of the restaurant and seemed like an unnecessary distraction from an otherwise lengthy menu.  It is still a place that I come back to occasionally because of some of the signature go-to items.  Tip:  Use the \"No wait\" app to put your name in ahead of time.  It doesn't guarantee you a spot outside, but does help reduce the wait time since they don't accept reservations."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best \"Charlotte\" restaurants. This restaurant is tucked away on the second floor of one of the building on Plaza Midwood's \"main and main\" Focusing only on dinner service, Sould Gastrolounge has a cult-like following in Charlotte and regulars alike. I have never been dissapointed with the food at Soul, and the chef is constantly adding new and innovative dishes to the classics on the menu.   There's not a bad seat in the house but my favorites in order are: outside on the small patio on a nice day, inside at the low couch table if I'm with 3-4 people, and at the DJ bar if I'm with one other person. Don't expect to sit at the bar unless you get there right at 5pm. If you come later than 5pm, expect a short wait. Grab one of the incredible drinks made by the well-informed bartenders and mingle with the other patrons or stand outside on the patio and admire the view of Uptown Charlotte.   There are so many different items to explore on the menu but my \"don't miss\" favorites are: Pork Belly Tacos (order 3), Shells and Cheese (sinfully delicious), Brussel Sprouts (never taste this good when I cook them), Soul Roul (yes, their sushi is GREAT), Ahi Tuna tacos, and the Lamb Lollipops. You're not going to go wrong with this menu, but if you come here and don't order the pork belly tacos you're doing it wrong."}
{"text":"I love love love this place!  I love the global collection of food. The garlic fries are so good and some were the shrimp and lamb skewers. The pan con tomate was delicious and so was the salmon-o-pita. The stiffed burger sliders are also good. I wasn't a fan of the Korean bbq chicken wings, they were a bit too spicy for me. I loathe the day that I get to try the pork belly tacos. They've been sold out every time that I've gone. If you're a drinker, get their Moscow mule. They are delicious. They make their own ginger beer and lime mix so it's not like any other. It's a very small place but the ambience is posh and swanky. The wait to get a table can be a pain so get there early or go on a weekday to avoid the crowds."}
{"text":"Probably one of our favorite date spots.  Delicious and fun tapas options.  Great drink menu.  Good vibe.   Worst part is waiting in line but they have an app in which you can place your name and monitor wait times."}
{"text":"I always come to this place expecting a wait, however after my recent experience I will never be coming back here again.    First of all, my friend and I were told that the wait would be an hour and a half to two hours, fine, we weren't expecting much less anyway.  In reality we weren't seated for three hours, and it would have been longer if my friend and I weren't walking out the door.  The issue was that instead of giving us our well deserved table, the host was allowing his \"friends\" to cut in front of us.  This is, in my opinion, completely unacceptable.     My second biggest issue involves the bartender.  To pass time my friend and I were going to have some drinks at the bar, but our experience was terrible.    I am absolutely unashamed to call out the bartender right now.  Although I don't know his name, I can describe him. He has very strange hair that is shaved on one side and flipped on the other, and wears these steam-punk inspired glasses.  Let me say, this guy is a complete jerk and should not be working in the hospitality industry PERIOD.   My friend and I were  standing at the bar waiting for a drink for 45 minutes.  He was blatantly ignoring us.  Everytime I waved at him he would say \"I will get to you in a minute\" however, during this period at least 10 other people, if not more, were served who were not waiting before us and just got to the bar.  In fact, some girl walked up to the left side of the bar after we were patiently waiting, (which by the way is not allowed) and was served.  This happened not once, but twice, and no she was not a waitress.  Finally when I was able to get my drink from him he asked for my I.D.  which is totally fine except I was already being served alcoholic beverages.  When I told this his was response was \"you should take that as a compliment\".  I honestly believe the only reason he made me take out my I.D was to harass me and make my life more difficult since my friend and I were obviously getting upset with him.      Bottom line is, the wait sucked but if I had a pleasurable experience at the bar it wouldn't have mattered.  Not to mention my friend and I were planning on drinking a lot so the bartender screwed his own pocket out of valuable tips, as well as the restaurant.  Because of that, I will not be coming back to this place, which I am a pretty frequent customer of.  This gentleman may be a good bartender, but it is blatantly obvious that he shows favoritism to certain customers and I hope that the restaurant sees this review and takes it into consideration whether to keep him or not.  My review doesn't do it justice how rude he was.   On a side note, the other male bartender was very charming."}
{"text":"Great small plates, great decor buy what really makes this place visiting was the ambiance - the DJ in the middle of the restaurant spinning deep house and sphere-like tunes while devouring the creative dishes - BOOM."}
{"text":"Some really good, unique dishes. Came here tonight with some friends and I was definitely impressed. Ordered the pork belly tacos, the chicken skin nachos, the shells and cheese, pan con tomate, ahi tuna tacos, and the Korean wings. The shells and the pan con tomate were some of the favorites of the group. Wasn't a huge fan of the wings. Would have probably gotten the short ribs or another dish but hindsights 20/20. Get here early though! I showed up at 450, 10 minutes before they opened, and shortly after all the tables were taken, as they don't take reservations. Definitely a solid place and I can see why it's rated too high. Service was solid throughout, but i, all about the food anyway."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to trying this place with a friend and we were severely disappointed by the food.    Let me counter that by saying that the staff was great, friendly and honest.  I would hang out here for drinks in the evening to hear the music inside or stand outside and look at the skyline.    The Food:   We started with the white bean and goat cheese dip with pita chips.  It was ok.  Nothing special, not too much flavor - but it was white beans.    Next, the chorizo.  WARNING - this was the most disgusting thing I've ever been served.  I couldn't tell if it was raw or just packed full of fat.  It was falling apart in the casing and was so chewy we never actually got to the point of swallowing.    The sardine fries were interesting.  They were mini sardines (full body - head to tail) deep fried with dipping sauce.   Lastly, the lamb lollipops.  These were also no good.  They were so fatty and a little overcooked.    I think the menu was good in theory with a horrible execution.  It seemed like they were trying to be too fancy and didn't quite cut it.  When I looked around, I realized no one else was eating.  Everyone there was just there to drink.  That should have told me something.    Overall:  If you just want a cool place to drink and possibly order some dip and pita chips, then you'd like this place.  Everyone seems pretty cool and laid back.  If you are sick of Thomas Street or you've grown out of Snug Harbor, this could be your new hang out.    If you're looking for a nice meal, look somewhere else.  My suggestion would be Crepe Cellar in NoDa - they've got an amazing menu and daily specials."}
{"text":"I don't get all the hype.  Totally over -rated.  Menu is just weird. And there are too many places to eat in Charlotte to wait in line for a place that doesn't accept reservations."}
{"text":"Love this place, good food and atmosphere.  Love the veal short ribs and the ceviche is soooo good! Great place to get a lot of everything! Bartender remembered us when we came back in only to have met us once a month before! Easy latenight \"go to\" spot"}
{"text":"Our favorite in the Plaza Midwood area for several years now. Great thing about Soul is that you go here 5 times and try 5 different items from the menu.  From Sushi to Baba Ganoush and many choices in between Soul has your ticket to a great date night dinner.  Small plates range from $4-$20 so you can eat on the cheap or splurge on your girl."}
{"text":"Tried out the place for brunch. It was a 45 minute wait at 1:00pm so we were able to find 2 chairs at the bar. The bartender was very, very accomodating when we wanted to order an omelette to order and the kitchen wouldn't let us. Apparently you can ONLY order what is on the menu because the kitchen is very small and they just don't have the means to make things to order. We attempted to order something off the menu and the kitchen said they were out. The bartender made a recommendation and kept filling our mimosas for free. I love this place for dinner but brunch was just as good. Huge portions and the stuffed sage sausage french toast is devine."}
{"text":"This service and atmosphere is one of a kind. The food is unique and always tasty. This is definitely a date night place. No babies. I recommend this to everyone who's visiting to Charlotte as a place they shouldn't miss!  Had a lovely time tonight thank you :)"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb.com. Here's what is waiting here for two hours though for - ....    Nothing. Go somewhere else if you can.   When they tell you the wait is around 1:15 and it's been 2:15. Go somewhere else.   Yeah, the pork belly tacos are good, but not that good, yeah.  Someone should train the staff on a more accurately leveled seating and wait system - instead of texting their clientele to download some outdated, poorly reviewed smartphone app that incorrectly maps out the system - even more so than their staff itself."}
{"text":"I HIGHLY recommend this hot spot. This is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to and the absolute best in Charlotte. The only bad thing about this place is the wait you'll have to deal with but they use the Nowait App which is super convenient. After having dinner with my girlfriends here one night, I have made it almost a weekly routine to hit this place up. I've had the bruschetta (topped with fried cheese goat balls), sushi, bean and goat cheese dip, the hummus, and the avocado salad. It was all amazing."}
{"text":"Daydreaming about the pork belly tacos.....yum..... there were a few other things we ordered that I could live without and were just okay.  This place has a very eclectic crowd and only like 8-10 tables."}
{"text":"Arrived late one night and the wait was out the door. Really thought I was going to be impressed according to how busy they were. After a 45 minute wait and placed my order they were all out of why I wanted so I chose the chicken chips. When it arrived at the table I was excited by the appearance however the taste was not good to me."}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin but this place is amazing and the food is great. I'm a huge fan of lamb and few places do lamb dead on but this place nailed it. They offer a good cheese plate but they should use better or different toasts or crackers.   The atmosphere was very relaxed and chill. This place got packed around 10:00pm on the inside. The waiting staff was very good with timing between checking up on us and good knowledge of their foods.   We didn't stick around for dessert though, we went else where for that.  We spent three hours there when it felt like a hour. I'd strongly recommend that anyone take the time to try this place out."}
{"text":"Don't come here with a large group. As other reviewers stated, the servers don't have any desire to deal with more than 6 people at a time. I can't count how many times we heard the answer \"we're so slammed\" when we asked about items we ordered and were missing, or when we inquired about our servers  We had 3 tables on the patio (in winter) with 12 people, and were asked to give up 2 of our tables because we were congregating around one of the tables while waiting for our plates to come out. We originally had tried to move the tables together, but we were stopped by the staff that said \"we're not doing that\" in a 2nd grade teacher tone. I understand moving tables can be frowned upon but we were in a corner outside and were not told during our 2 hour wait that we would not be seated together. Bottom line, scolding customers is not an acceptable way to communicate. Only reason for 2 stars is because other than one hair in sushi incident at the end of the meal, everyone loved the food. I've had 3 or 4 great meals there before this but now I doubt I will return."}
{"text":"Rudest experience we have ever had.  5 or 6 different interactions and we felt completely disregarded.  You guys have excellent food and a cool space but Cora the hostess has ensured we will never come back.  Other note:  we were told it would be a 2-2.5 hour wait.  We checked in after 2 hours and was told 2 more hours....messed up a special dinner with out of town nephew leaving for the Navy.   Our loss food wise but that hipster grumpy, too cool attitude gets really old.  Good luck."}
{"text":"I've frequented Soul quite a few times since it has opened.  I generally prefer to hit the bar up after work on a weekday when the crowds are sparse and they play interesting tunes.  On weekends, however, the wait for a table gets too crazy (although you can head to 22 below while you wait, which is a new plus), the service can suffer, and it gets way too boom-boom club for my taste.  I also have noticed a steady increase in their prices since they've opened, but it can still be an affordable place if you order carefully.  That aside, I've had pretty good food here over the past year or so.  I think there was a period--maybe in the summer of this year--where they missed the mark a few times when I visited, but I'm happy to say that on my most recent visits, it's been quite nice.    My standbys usually are the mini-Cheeseburgers, the Cheese Plate (mainly for the quince, which is delicious ,but I always have to ask for more bread), the truffle fries, and most of the sushi rolls.    So, enjoy Soul, but I recommend it during the off hours."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Charlotte! Yes it is a small place and yes you will wait to be seated. If you don't want to wait then go early, as in before 6:00pm or on an early weeknight. Pork belly tacos are a must! Also a great place for a nice seasonal cocktail list."}
{"text":"Fantastic date spot.  Food is great, atmosphere is right on point.  The only issue I've ever had is that they don't take reservations, which puts a damper on planning for the evening.  That said, they text you when your table is ready and there is a great bar right downstairs where you can relax until called."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here on a Friday night when we were in Charlotte for the weekend.  They don't take reservations (which I knew going in), so we waited almost 2 hours for a table.  However, the atmosphere is really cool, and everything we ordered was delicious.  Go there early, expect to wait, and definitely order the dirty south nachos!"}
{"text":"I felt like was in a Forno.  Soul grastrolounge I would make so many babies with you if I could.  You could tie me up and do whatever you want to me. I seriously could eat here everyday.  NY Lounge style with awesome DJs are here everyday of the week.  The outside seating has a little view of the city and waiters/waitresses are always cool.  Lets get it on with the food.  Sashimi Tacos were the first thing I have ever eaten here.  So fresh and drizzled with some siracha mayo.  Oh yes mouthgasm.  I honestly am drooling on my keyboard right now.  The second time I was here I had the lamb lollipops which I haven't seen in a while.  So friggin good. The steak and egg was great for a good snack as well.  The last time I was here I saw something I have always dreamed of.  Fried chicken skins.  Now I know that sounds nasty and white trash as all hell, but when in Charlotte do as nascar does. The pimento fondue and jalapeno pickled okra complimented this very well. All the food here is just exceptional I can go on and on and on.    This is probably my favorite restaurant in Charlotte now. ( sorry chima, its over)  They have specials every night that are just concoctions of genius.  Add them to your FB or twitter you won't be disappointed. Soul is a perfect tapas restaurant with intelligent food ideas, great drinks, and great music.  Other places could learn a lot from Soul. The only cons I have are that this place can get packed, and my bank account hates me."}
{"text":"Try the Lamb chops - to die for . I wanted to give them a 5 stars but I feel they became a little more pricy and their portions have become super smaller . Also, their atmosphere is super loud now, maybe they were having some special night those 2 days I was there last ? I couldn't even have a conversation because the music was as loud as a club ."}
{"text":"My sister in law suggested this place while I was in Charlotte for work. This was one of the few bars open during the week day during late  hours (points for that). When you walk up the outside stair way, the business offers seating on the balcony and I believe I saw heaters outside as well - for the patrons that choose to sit outside on the cold nights. My sister and I were freezing so we opted to sit inside. The seating in here seems a little limited to me but my sister in law says they often draw large crowds at this establishment. After we took our seat, our waitress came over to welcome us and take our drink order. I wasn't too impressed by the speciality drink selection options but ended up trying the The Golden King (this one has rum in it). When the drink came back my taste buds could not tell me if I actually liked the drink or if I didn't like the drink. I think I liked the drink because I finished it or maybe due to the price I finished it. To me the Golden King is stronger drink, so I don't suggest it if you are looking for something sweet. Next my sister ordered a white dip. This came with pita chips. The dip was cream cheese tasting dip, something i never had before and tasted ok. Finally I opted to order some sushi. Now this was really good! I can't remember the name of the roll but I took a picture. After I ate dinner I really wanted a cupcake but the only make one flavor of the day. The day I came it was chocolate which I am not a fan of, so no cupcake for me. I do give this place props for the decoration, late hours, and sushi!"}
{"text":"I love Soul. I am always welcomed right in, snuggle up to the bar for a stiff drink, and more often than not, wait for a table. If the table wait is too long, you can grab a bite at the bar and its just as good. I've done that with 3 others in my group before and it worked just fine. They have a daily special food menu, albeit, its limited, in addition to the delicious full menu they always have. They have the popular items like the pork belly tacos and all their yummy sushi (some of the best sushi you can get around Charlotte, I think) as well as specials like grilled octopus with potatoes and smoked paprika potatoes. I just love it there.  The drink menu is one of the best in town and the bartenders will listen to what you like an d make you a refreshing cocktail that way too.  Its a great date night place or a fun place for you and your girlfriends to go. Whatever the reason, just go!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for a group of 4-6 friends. Get about 20% more plates than people and you'll be full. Can't go wrong with anything, my favorite is the ramen."}
{"text":"Been here many times, great food, great music, wide selection of cuisine.  LOVE!!!"}
{"text":"after 6 yrs in Charlotte finally made it in & it was worth every minute of the wait!  I had the ahi tuna watermon tacos & the ramen.  Simply oh la la!!  can't add any more to what everyone else has said to this marvelous place except create a phone in waiting list, accept reservations, & when is a bigger location to be opening & another location in the Ballantyne area."}
{"text":"the foods here is awesome.  very good foods and atmosphere.  The only thing about this good place is the wait, they have very long wait, about couple of hours on the weekend and 45 mins on weekdays.  So make sure you have time if you try out this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to try Soul since they opened, and decided our 1 year anniversary this past weekend was the perfect occasion. We arrived at 8:00pm on a Monday and were surprised to find out there was a 30 minute wait. Around 30 min later we were sat at the bar and the food was more than worth the wait.  We started out with four dishes; Baba Ghanoush dip, anchovy bruschetta, lamb cheek profiteroles, and curried lamb skewers. The Baba ghanoush with pita chips was smoky and spicy, probably the best I've ever had. The marinated Spanish white anchovies on Bruschetta were refreshing, lite, and full of flavor, everything on the bruschetta was super fresh. The profiteroles for me were by FAR the highlight of the meal and one of the top 5 dishes I've ever eaten in my life. The kitchen was on point because everything on this plate was perfection. It was the first time I've had savory profiteroles which I thought was very creative, they were stuffed with tender lamb cheek, mushroom jam, and a foie gras  mousse. The three ingredients just kind of melted together and although the portion was small, they were so rich that it really ended up being the perfect amount. I would normally have a heart attack after paying $18 for 3 golf ball sized \"sandwiches\" but these were so good that we will probably order them every time we go back! The last dish of our first go around was the curried lamb skewers with mango chutney. The lamb was cooked and seasoned well, but there wasn't anything necessarily special about the lamb itself. But, the mango chutney was perfection, and we probably could've eaten a few bowls of that on its own. The pairing of the curry with the sweetness of the mango worked perfectly and definitely elevated the flavor of the lamb.  Our second go around we ordered the Rocky Mountain Oysters, Sakana Roll, and Korean BBQ wings. The choice of the Rocky Mountain Oysters was really just out of curiosity. I always see Food Network hosts eating them when they're in Colorado and I was curious to taste them. They were perfectly cooked and incredibly tender, but I just did not care for the taste. They were good and my husband ended up eating the whole plate, but there is nothing in this world I hate more than liver, and although very mild, they did have a slight liver taste. The Sakana roll was pretty good and I really liked the combination of sauces that they served it with. Finally we had the Korean BBQ wings which were cooked perfectly. They were tender, very moist, and very flavorful.  The only disappointment of the night was dessert. I was eyeing the goat cheese ice cream since I first opened up the menu and when we ordered it the waitress told us they no longer make that flavor and we must have received an old menu. That was kind of a buzzkill, but we moved on and ordered the Vietnamese coffee ice cream. This is definitely not a cheap restaurant, but up until dessert, everything we ordered was more than worth the price. The ice cream scoop was $4 and it was about a 3oz scoop barely larger than a golf ball. I guess we're kind of picky because we make ice cream at home a lot, but our 1st shot at Vietnamese coffee ice cream was better than that. It was not a huge deal, just kind of anticlimactic after such delicious savory dishes.  My husband also ordered an Old Fashioned and said it was delicious. Lastly, the DJ was fantastic and one of the highlights of the night. We were seated right in front of him which was entertaining, and he was playing old school records all night which was the perfect type of music to accompany our food!  All in all it was one of the best meals we've ever had and cannot wait to go back. My husband thinks we can try the whole menu in 3 more visits, which I think is a bit ambitious, but I'm sure we will get there eventually!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Very creative and great quality food. Pork belly tacos are one of the best things I've ever eaten. The flatbread is awesome too."}
{"text":"Foods good... To many 25k millionaire millennials complaining about their hard lives and how they deserve more?  I always love the pork belly tacos!!  Wish I could find a day to go when all the of libitards are asleep or hungover to really enjoy the place?! Maybe when they move on to what's next... tight suites and high waters...lol!?"}
{"text":"This is the whole package! Its best to go Herr with friends and share many small plates and sushi rolls. They have a DJ that spins while you eat. The only negative is how small the place is so there will always be a wait and its hard to accommodate large parties. If you are waiting make sure you go downstairs to twenty two for a drink and view some local art!"}
{"text":"Again, Soul does not disappoint.  I finally went back last night after a 7-month hiatus because I was living abroad, and the food was actually better than I remember.  We ate the sashimi tuna tacos, goat cheese bruschetta (I can't help but get both of these each time I go), the sushi special, and the oh-my-goodness these are the best things I've ever had pork belly tacos.  Now don't get me wrong, the sashimi tuna tacos are amazeballs, but I just found my new favorite dish at Soul.  The melt in your mouth pork belly and refreshing watermelon were such a perfect combination that I didn't even care when my date pointed out that I had dripped grease all over the front of my dress.  I've had the same waiter almost every time and he is great as always.  Very knowledgeable about the menu, attentive, and fun to interact with."}
{"text":"Oh man, where do I start? Okay, so I went here for my 28th birthday with my family. The atmosphere is dark but comforting. I don't remember much else about the decor as I was so interested in the food in which I was about to partake! With that said, this place has some very tasty dishes. We began the night with some sushi, which were as good as could be. Then we moved on to 'the good stuff'. I ordered the pork belly tacos, omagherrd. Also got to try the baked cheese plate dealy thingy, it's like three or four cheeses melded together bathed in a Brandy, sooo goood. I have yet to try the Lamb Lollys but hear they're amazing. :) Give this one a try for sure! You won't be disappointed! Top 10 in Charlotte for sure."}
{"text":"Holy crap this place rules. The shells stuffed with BBQ tossed in cheese and BBQ sauce is unreal. They also have the best sushi in Charlotte. Which is crazy weird because it's not an Asian place but MAN it's good. I really wish they'd move or open a second or third or fourth location! The wait is SO LONG. Although it's good they are on the \"No wait\" app, that helps. I don't know why they haven't opened a new location, they get enough business!! Attn: owners!! Open another location! We love your food! Take our money! LOL."}
{"text":"Food and service at Soul is too up and down, well the service is mostly bad. The food is great I'd say about 60% of the time but if the service is that bad the food has to be better than 60%. The atmosphere is great and the patio has a good view."}
{"text":"I love this place so much that I almost don't want to give a review for fear of too many people finding out about this absolute gem of a restaurant.  The staff is one of a kind, the ambiance is like morphing out of Charlotte and into LA, and the food is a work of art.  We usually get the same thing every time: Edamame, an Eel Roll, a Yellowtail Roll, and BBQ French Fries.    Sometimes it gets crowded and the staff forgets--so make sure you ask about their specials for the evening.  They are usually a 10 out of 10.  The word \"fan\" is putting it lightly.  I am in love with Soul."}
{"text":"Weekly night out with the girls. Great food, drinks, music, atmosphere & especially great prices! You'll wait a while for a table when they open (well worth it) or you can come in a couple of hours after work when it dies down. Love this gem!"}
{"text":"I thought this was a for-profit business but was surprised to learn it has morphed into some sort of artists' colony where the personal expression of a \"mixologist\" is of supreme importance. Don't ask for, say, the sugar rim to be left off your $14 cocktail. The answer will come back: \"No. I have designed this cocktail with a sugar rim and that's how I will serve it.\"   ...Yeah. It's that kind of place.  Charlotte has hundreds of restaurants and bars where the person paying for an overpriced beverage can actually weigh in on the drink they'll consume."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly service, great music and ambience.   Overall, I can't say the food here is overwhelmingly amazing and worth the three hour weekend wait. I'd return but only an weekday in hopes of a shorter wait. Pork belly tacos are as good as everyone raves about and I usually hate anything pork related. Sushi is also very good, I really enjoyed the Soul roll. Ramen bowl was pretty disappointing, didn't want any more after one bite.   Be aware: the app they use that tells you your place in line is not accurate. We thought we had plenty of time so we were out and about, killing time (we were told a two-three hour wait)... App said there were 17 parties ahead of us when we got the \"your table is ready, please come within ten minutes\" text. Make sure you stay somewhat nearby."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere if you like low lighting with intimate seating. I'm not a huge fan of sushi but this place has made me open my mind to it. Plated beautifully and tasted fresh. My husband called ahead to see what the dj would be playing and the hostess didn't know. That would be my only complaint, I'm not a fan of house/techno music but tolerated it due to the great food!"}
{"text":"Soul is too sexy for me. Soul is that too cool for school always a little more fashion forward than you kid. Their mixed drinks are simply divine and I adore their cucumber water. Such a little touch. But so refreshing. Yes, it is a struggle to find where to park (come on all hipsters just ride their bikes anyway) but once you traverse upstairs its worth it. Start with ahi tuna tacos, or lamb lollipops, or the surprisingly ample portioned cheese plate. Heck, start with anything. Finish with a cupcake. Got to love a place with a stuffed peacock on the wall that serves sushi and cupcakes and a hosts a monthly drag queen disco brunch. Get here early. Don't forget your skinny jeans and fedora."}
{"text":"A lot of places in Charlotte are proud to prepare food with local farm products. Soul is also one of those places. Every time my girls come down from the east coast, this is a place on the list that we never skip. The ambience at night is like NYC restaurant, funky music, live dj and all kinds of food - sushi to steak. The wait is also similar to hopping restaurant in NYC. Seriously you can go in at 10 PM and still have to wait 30 mins for a table (this did happen btw) But the wait is worth it. Make sure to always get the truffle fries! The kabobs are damn good and so are sliders. But their lamb chops certainly are my fav. We have even done brunch there and the menu is almos tthe same and so is the wait lol. Bt the bloody mary's make up for it!! Definitely a fun place to take your friends...be prepared for a wait, make sure to take in some drinks and just enjoy it all."}
{"text":"When I walked into to Soul Gastrolounge, one word came to mind... Asheville. It felt just like I was in downtown Asheville eating at one of the fun and laid back restaurants that makes that city so different from Charlotte. I love going to a restaurant where you know it will not be replicated literally 20 miles away, no chain feeling here. Soul has a unique menu with lots to choose from. The prices are very reasonable and the portions are fun so that you can order a variety with friends when you go. I would highly recommend the Tuna Taco, that was my favorite. There were so many tasty items I had trouble narrowing it down which often times I have trouble finding anything on the menu. Try this place out and you won't be disappointed! If you love dining in Asheville's restaurants you will feel right at home."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and delicious food and cocktails. I really don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. The sushi is so fresh and the truffle fries were bangin!"}
{"text":"Yes, there is a wait.  And there is a major reason there is a wait.  BECAUSE THE FOOD HERE IS FREAKING DELICIOUS!!  I went here with a group, and we decided to devour everything in our path.  Here are some of the must haves:  1.) The Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos.....are you kidding me??  These were some of the most delicious things I have ever put in my mouth.  I could take a bath in that glaze.  And topped with watermelon....who was the genius who came up with that?  I want to marry that person.  2. Sashimi Tuna Tacos.  Prior to eating here, I wanted nothing to do with raw anything.  I am a changed woman after having had these tacos.  Between these and the Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos, this could have been my whole meal and I would have gone home happy.  But there is more.....  3. Fried Brussel Sprouts..... fan-freaking-tastic.  Maybe not the most exciting thing to order, but so delicious all the same.  4. The dips.  Oh yum, the dips.  We had tzatziki, babaganoush, and white bean dip.  With crisp pita chips.  No, I don't weigh 500 pounds.  But after having to physically sit on my hands so I wouldn't lick these dips from my fingers, I probably should.  5. I was told that this place has some of the best sushi in the city.  So of course I had to order a roll.  And I was not disappointed.  I got the Red Dragon Roll, and one of the others in my group got the Dancing Tuna Roll.  Orgasm in my belly.     6. Various members of my group got different types of skewers.  Chicken, chimchurri beef, and gyros.  Now while I didn't try all of these personally, the fact that these skewers disappeared into various bellies within minutes of hitting the table likely speaks volumes as to how good they were.    7.  OH MY GOD, THE TRUFFLE FRIES.  THE MOTHER-FREAKING TRUFFLE FRIES.   My only caveat is that we were so full by the end that we could not possibly fit in another bite and so did not get to try dessert.  But it's okay because I will be back very very soon to eat my way through the rest of the menu.    This place is absolutely, 100% worth waiting for a table.  Spend the wait by going to the bar for one of their cocktails, the Nude Beach and the Cucumber Mule are so delicious and refreshing that you may just forget that you went there to eat......though I wouldn't recommend that.  Ask for Matt as a server, if nothing I mentioned above sounds appealing (and if it doesn't, just forget about going, because you obviously have no taste), then Matt will definitely recommend something on the menu that will have you licking your plate, he knows his stuff for sure."}
{"text":"The best food in Charlotte. The most common complaints are seating and waiting. I have gone there four times. If u want a nice calm dining experience get there at five."}
{"text":"In my global travels and foodie adventures, This is one of my favorite places I have ever stumbled upon. We came here on a Sunday night after a mediocre dinner elsewhere and wanted some yummy dessert and post-dinner drinks. Our server was attentive and very passionate about describing her drink recommendations. As a big city girl, I was shocked and couldn't have  been more impressed with the amazing cocktail they served me and how well it complimented my bread pudding. I will absolutely be back here if I ever get back to Charlotte. The place was hopping for a Sunday night so I am obviously not the only person who loves this place!"}
{"text":"Seating is nice for a coffee shop but not a bar, only a few traditional tables, otherwise you end up eating at a cramped bar or off a coffee table.   We went here hoping for good Mediterranean food - evidently sushi is the way to go.   We had the dip trio and while the tzatziki and babaghanouge were above par the hummus was flat and flavorless.   Also ordered the spanokopitia which was disappointing.   The phyllo was dry and not buttery and there was a scant amount of feta to balance the spinach.   The linguini special was very good as was the grilled ceaser salad.   The sushi looked amazing and some of the other small plates looked worthy of a second try.  But it may be time to jettison the Mediterranean aspects of the menu which lack the same quality."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere for a relaxed lounge night with the ladies. I am exploring the Charlotte area and I  will be returning"}
{"text":"Ate dinner at the Peculiar Rabbit on a friend's suggestion, but wish I ate here instead. We popped in for a drink and were welcomed very warmly by the hostess. The DJ was playing some very cool lounge music. The bartenders-awesome! The guys gave my friends and I great recommendations and were very fun to chill with. I WILL be back for sushi and their brunch sometime in the near future!!"}
{"text":"There isn't a thing on the menu I haven't enjoyed! Even the cupcakes!! You can always trust that the staff will help you choose what's new and fantastic. I'm not a picky eater, so I even let my server pick all of the tapas on our last visit! I want to say we had at least 8 or 9-Every item she chose was amazing! The cocktails are incredibly delicious (I'm a St. Germain lover) and they have a wonderful wine list. Love how cozy it is inside, too!"}
{"text":"Went to Soul for this year's birthday dinner. I had heard so much about it and I was very excited. Soul didn't disappoint but I can't say that it was the best meal I've ever had. We ordered all the recommended items. I can say that the cocktails were pretty fantastic. I had the Winter Mule (fantastic!). The pork belly was perfectly tender and had a nice crispy exterior. The only disappointing part was there was a slight taste of something else (maybe fishy). Perhaps it was time to change the oil that they finish the pork belly in. The fish on the Soul Roll was fantastic but the roll could have used some more flavor. The Dirty South nachos were over the top indulgent and I loved them. I could feel my arteries tighten LOL.   Overall, I'll stop in to Soul again and I'll deem in Charlotte good :)"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Friday night, we got there early in an attempt to beat the wait and we just barely did. We got there at 5 and starting at 5:30 the place began to fill up. The tables are very small and very close together so just prepare yourself for that.  I wasn't able to eat the sushi but my husband did and he said it was excellent, can't wait until I am able to give it a try myself!  We also had the pesto arugula flatbread and that was probably my favorite item. The goat cheese with the honey garlic was perfect. We also sampled the shrimp skewers which were good but nothing super amazing. We had the southern fried oysters which I quite enjoyed and the dipping sauce was very delicious, spicy but not overwhelming. We had the serrano and manchego cheese on toast which was delicious. Overall everything we had was good and we will def go back. I will def. be trying their sushi personally as I hear it is the best in the city!"}
{"text":"this place is adorable. I went on valentines day. the wait was an hour and a half but I got seated really quick. I had the sushi, and tuna tacos. it was soooooo good. to bad I'm not from Charlotte or live there, but if I do I will visit this establishment again."}
{"text":"This place is so fun! Went on a weekday night around 10pm. The place was pretty busy, but we only had to wait 5 minutes to be seated.  There was a DJ playing some tunes.. Delightful atmosphere...  I ordered the sushi and it was delish! It came served with this sauce, not sure what it was, but it was so good!!   There were so many things I wanted to try on the menu that I'm gonna have to keep coming back for more!   I definitely will bring friends/family here when they come visit."}
{"text":"I have been here three times and if they were open for lunch this number would be higher.  I have ordered a wide variety of items and have found each and every one of them to be quite enjoyable.  I rarely order drinks when I am out because I have an extensive bar at home and work at the best liquor store in the carolinas, but I did order drinks here and they were as good as the food!  The place is small and crowded, but it is worth the wait for the excellent food and drink that are available.  This is just one of those places that everyone needs to try at least once.  The menu is a lot of fun and you should have no trouble finding something that you will enjoy a great deal on it."}
{"text":"During my visit to Charlotte my friend chose Soul as our first stop for a fun Friday night and a bite to eat. Upon walking in, I noticed it was jam packed and that reservations may have been needed. We went ahead and put our name in and the hostess said it would only be about twenty minutes. Nice, thats a drink at the bar first!  The bar had a spacious standing area that I was happy about. (I hate lurking over peoples shoulders so that our feet are in the \"bar area\"). About a drink in and another on the way, we began talking to the group beside us and found out a few went to the same college as my friend which spurred more chat. It must have been twenty minutes later...(although I was now 3 drinks complete hhmm), when the hostess signaled us to a large table nearby. Our new friends were still waiting so we invited them as well.   The place had such a great energy that everyone was feeling the buzz. We ordered more drinks which was when I was introduced to the Firefly Peach cocktail. Things were fuzzy after that drink made it's appearance, but damn it was good!  In the haze, I do recall having a few tapas passed around and thinking they were tasty morsels of goodness...I just can't recall what in the world they were...."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants, however after multiple bad experiences I can't say that I will be dining here again. My most recent experience was definitely the last.   It's always a rough time trying to get a table so I'm always prepared for a lengthy wait. My party of 3 was quoted a wait time of 45 mins to an hour, however after over an hour of waiting we started to notice party after party walking in and getting seated right away, including a party of 6. We spoke with the hostess who informed us she can't seat a party of 3 in a 6 person booth. Even if we've been waiting so long? They'll keep it empty until the required number of people show up? Doesn't make sense.   Once we got seated I spoke with a manager and let me tell you I have never had worse customer service coming from a MANAGER. He completely dismissed my concerns by simply saying there were things I didn't understand. He made it perfectly clear that my experience was none of his concern and I was not valued as a customer.  It is clear Soul Gastrolounge only cares about one thing, and that is the money, and not customer service. Needless to say, an hour and a half wait and $200+ tab is not worth it to be treated so unwelcoming.  I might add that, despite running food to our table several times, this manager never once checked in to see how the rest of our experience was."}
{"text":"Completely and utterly blown away.  Soul has always been on my list of to-dos, but I think I always found myself going somewhere else because I couldn't find anything super special about this place ... but boy, was I wrong.  We came in around 8:30 p.m. on Monday and didn't have to wait, but the place was packed. Seated and greeted immediately, we took a minute to look over the menu and decided on starting with the dip trio; we chose hummus (which I believe was Tahini that day), tzatziki, and some caviar sauce. Despite loving all three of them, the dips lasted us all our courses, and there was still so much leftover at the end.  With guidance from our server, we ordered the Korean BBQ wings, dirty nachos and pork belly tacos.  The wings were super tender, and the sauce wasn't anything I expected. Honestly, I could've done without the dirty nachos; the chicken skins tasted almost burnt and the pimento cheese seemed to be just melted American. The pork belly tacos were by far my favorite, and they are reasonably hyped. Sweetness of the pork belly was perfectly balanced with the sourness of the watermelon.  For dessert, we had the chocolate brioche bread pudding with a miso caramel ice cream. I loved the ice cream because the caramel wasn't too overpowering. The bread pudding itself wasn't too chocolatey either, and the perfect size.  Needless to say, will be back, and I can't wait."}
{"text":"After reading several reviews re: wait times, we decided to try this place right at 5 p.m. when it opened for an early birthday dinner. Overall it was a lovely experience. The cocktails tasted great. The food was delicious and the host and waitress were very friendly. As it got busier, the service was a little slower and I do wish the prices were more reasonable considering how small the portions are (even for tapas). But overall, if you'd like to indulge on a special night out, this place was great."}
{"text":"If you love good music, atmosphere and tapas this is the place to be! The steak and egg is the greatest! I would eat 10 of them if I could."}
{"text":"Hipsters... hipsters EVERYWHERE!!  Seems like this spot is where all the cool pigeons flock. Gross.  BUT THE  Pork Belly Tacos. Sweet, salty, crunchy and juicy in one bite! And the Red Dragon Roll (sub all tuna for more salmon) is right behind it!!! Frikking derricious!  Other than that the dry, dry truffle fries is not worth ordering. And the meatballs is.... O.O bleghhhh. I hated it. It reminded me of American meatloaf. I hate meatloaf."}
{"text":"This place has got soul! Too cheesy? It's okay just keep reading it gets better I promise. I just had to! Originally this was going to be a 5 star review but after a prompt return visit the hostess's bitchiness and ineptitude caused me to take away a star. More on that later. Buckle up kids this is going to be a long review.  I probably have to give Soul the award for some of the most creative and tastiest cuisine I've ever had in Charlotte. Yes it's that good. Even when you order something that sounds fairly normal, they managed to give it a creative twist. I'm so appreciative of that! The interior is very small, crowded and very loud. So be prepared for a long wait sometimes, especially since they don't take reservations. But the staff is nice without being over the top, and water refills are kept up. I especially like that they serve it with cucumber instead of the usual lemon. I never like the taste of lemon in water, but I do love the flavor a slice of cucumber can infuse!  My first trip here I went with tuna sashimi tacos, an amazing duck confit pasta topped with crispy sweetbreads and foie gras, and grilled toast topped with wild mushrooms and a fried egg with a Dijon vinaigrette. Finished with last but not least goat cheese ice cream. This meal contained probably some of the best things I've ever eaten anywhere in Charlotte.   Lets start with the tuna tacos, I've had something similar to this dish while I was in Cali, it was a deconstructed fish taco and so I was excited to find it here! It did not disappoint at all! The guacamole was flavorful and added dimension and fattiness to the tuna while the fried wonton wrapper gave it a lovely crunch, yum.  Next up came the duck confit pasta, now if the last dish was awesome this would qualify as a masterpiece. The duck confit paired with the delivered such amazing flavors that this dish could have easily fit into a high class restaurant. The foie gras' earthiness and richness complemented the pasta and gave it amazing depth of flavor, while the crispy sweetbreads brought the whole dish together some much needed texture. This dish is best eaten in small amounts though because it had such a rich, luxurious mouthfeel I felt quite sated after finishing half of the plate.  The last savory course of the evening was grilled wild mushrooms with a dijon vinaigrette over charred toast and topped with a fried egg. I wasn't even going to get this dish because I was quite full but I saw the table next to us get it and I had to have it. I thought this dish was the most balanced of the night with complex flavors and textures melding together in glorious harmony. Just get the thing and you'll be singing it's praises too.  Feeling like an overstuffed plush at this point, I decided to go all in and order the goat cheese ice cream. You could taste the grassiness of the goat cheese and the ice cream felt surprisingly low fat which surprised me. I think I'd prefer it if the flavor kicked me in the face next time like *WHAM* that's goat cheese alright! and maybe make the ice cream a bit more decadent? I just feel like you want to go all out for dessert and this let me down a bit.  The music here is very very very loud. I couldn't hear what my dining partner about a foot away was saying, I almost contemplated just texting each other across the table. The hostess the first time was perfectly nice, but my second time was so rude, unfriendly, and nasty that I just took my business elsewhere. For such excellent food though I'll brave all these missteps and take my chances."}
{"text":"Extremely experienced sushi chef. He uses his skill set on providing the best quality and presentation of the fresh fish he uses. The taste is phenomenal and it is definitely one of the best sushi places in Charlotte for sure. He always tries to bring something new each week with a specialty item which keeps the menu interesting. The ambiance is great and definitely a great place to grab a drink.   Everyone should definetly give it a visit!!!"}
{"text":"A really good tapas place that has a somewhat late night menu as well. They also have some decent beer available."}
{"text":"Came in last night for a girl's night and we were told the wait would be at least two hours. Normally, that would result in me trying someplace else but soul uses an app that allows you to monitor how many tables are ahead of you. So we went to common market for drinks while we waited. When we got back everything was awesome! They had a mussel feature that was delish. The guacamole stack is great with crispy bits of garlic. We also had the gyro skewers that we loved and a fantastic flatbread with pistachio pesto. Atmosphere is great and I highly recommend Jamie as a server. Very attentive and they have a great support staff. The fact that we could walk away made it feel like two hours was nothing. The experience made it even better!"}
{"text":"Walk with me up a long staircase to the 2nd floor to opens up to a covered deck lined with tables that are packed then turn left and walk the restaurant that is also packed...this alone let's you know you are in THE popular place. If you come alone like I did they will tell you that the tables are for couples or groups but the bar is first come first serve which you will wait over 20mins to sit down if not longer.   While I am waiting I see the bartenders making craft cocktails like the mixologists  that i love going to bars to see. But the first drink I order came out of a premix tap which was disappointing as it tastes like a margarita over ice. I told the bartender I would like something different and they gladly made me a drink that tasted like a Negroni and Sazerac had a baby and it was lovely. Then later I had a Cucumber Mule off of premix tab and it was really.   Now let's eat... I had the pork belly watermelon tacos and the lobster grilled cheese sandwich which was so yummy that I am going back for that alone. I wanna try other things on the menu like the bone marrow.   I really enjoyed it...the only down side was trying to find a place to park and the people that keep insisting on ordering drinks over me and my food without a single excuse me."}
{"text":"I came here for my 28th birthday with a mixed group of friends. Two very different friends both like this spot so I was intrigued. I was even more intrigued by their eclectic menu of sushi, Asian fusion, tacos, and burgers.  Everything was amazing, except this weird pork belly taco. I had a special salmon ramen with cream cheese sauce that was probably the most filling item on the menu. My roommate had a burger that he raved about and this guy eats more burgers than anyone else I've ever seen. A couple friends liked the sushi, although I'm sure there are better places for sushi.  Beers and drinks weren't as great. Most of it was served by the can, which was shocking considering Soul looks pretty fancy.  The booths are large and tall so you don't really even see other people. The space is dimly lit too.  Come for food not for drinks."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. From the food to the views of the city, it's the best!"}
{"text":"I love a good tapas bar because it means the portions are small, prices are decent and I can try many different things! Well, that's just what my date and I did! The place is upstairs and you walk in through the patio which is covered in the winter time, heated though. You walk in and the lighting is low, music is energetic and are greeted right away! We used the Yelp application to get on the wait-list and was sat almost right when we walked in. The exposed brick of the restaurant combined with the unique lighting was very appealing. Marlon was our server and he was INCREDIBLE. Well-spoken, knew the menu, made great suggestions and held great conversation. My date and I started off with the Godzilla Roll and Cheese Panini. Both very tasty. I then ordered the Lamb Skewer and she ordered the Mini Burgers. 3rd round consisted of Piquillo Pepper Toasts and Gyro Skewer. Everything was so good, my least favorite was the Gyro Skewer... it was just meat on a stick and a bit dry. My favorite... oh man. Those Lamb Skewers were incredible. I'd order like 30 of them as appetizer, meal AND dessert. They were so juicy and flavorful. I will definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"This is a Charlotte original. The best chill atmosphere, tunes, small bites and custom cocktails along with genuine service. Thank you everyone working at Soul!"}
{"text":"Snotty, pretentious, rude. Both the hostesses so rude and snotty. This place is not worth the wait or the pretentiousness! Service is awful, food was basic. Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food. My party tried a good spread of the tapas and sushi rolls and none of them were anything close to disappointing.  The lamb lollipops were fantastic, as was the ceviche. I ordered one of the house cocktails(not impressed) and then switched to beer (solid selection). The service was good and friendly. The interior was a touch loud but welcoming."}
{"text":"Finally got here at a time that had no wait!  5:30 pm on Saturday.  Of course we had to sit on the small patio, but the food made it all worthwhile!  And our server, Hailey - best server for sure!  She took the time to explain the whole menu to help my date with her gluten-free choices.  Plus she had recommendations that were awesome!    We had the garlic shrimp skewers (totally tasty!), shrimp ceviche ( in coconut milk!), Dancing Tuna Roll (taste was so good, I wanted to just keep it in my mouth!) and the Guacamole Stack (great concept that really works!).    Can't say much for the decor on the patio, but at least it was warm.  Hopefully next time I'll get to eat inside!  Thanks to all my Yelp friends who have recommend this place so strongly!"}
{"text":"Soul is by far my in my top three restaurants from Charlotte to Los Angeles.  Never have I had a bad experience.  The food is inventive, delicious and decadent.  The atmosphere is intimate and has a very cool vibe.  Be prepared to watch your neighbors expressions as their food is brought out - you will start having discussions about the intricate flavors and presentation and find yourself sharing with complete strangers.  I absolutely cannot go here without ordering at least two of the Pork Belly Watermelon Tacos.  Those alone are worth the trip.  This evening, we tried one of the specials - tempura asparagus with garlic aioli...yes, please!  We did ask for some extra aioli on the side and continued to sample it throughout the entire meal.  Next up was the Soul Roll - spicy salmon, cukes, jalape√±o, sliced white tuna, wasabi aioli, spicy mayo sauce  - just enough kick to finish off the delicate white tuna.    We followed the roll with the Pan Con Tomate  - Spanish chorizo, whipped manchego, rioja reduction - the fresh garlic and whipped manchego literally made me want to scrap the plate clean.  And don't miss out on the Flatbread with truffle whipped goat cheese, pistachio pesto, honey braised garlic and fresh arugula - one of my favorites to start the meal.  Just enough sweet with fresh arugla and how can you go wrong with goat cheese?!  If you care to partake in a drink - try the pink sake - tastes like a light, crisp sweet champagne.  The cucumber martini is perfect for Summer.  If you haven't tried Soul, run don't walk - you have no idea what you have been missing!"}
{"text":"What a cozy little cool joint up on the second floor of this corner building in Plaza-Midwood. I have been here three times and continue to be impressed with this place and it is quickly becoming my go to to just hang out with friends and have a drink. The tapas selection is great and you can't go wrong with any of them (ok, well maybe the rocky mountain oysters - which I tried and they were ok) but the goat cheese apps, the lamb lollipops, bruschetta - it's all great.   My dad would call this a \"yuppie joint\" but I give it two thumbs up for it's warm cozy atmosphere and great food. People watching is cool two."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite place in Charlotte! Absolutely everything I have had here is amazing, from the sushi to the goat cheese bruchetta, to the drinks on the menu. I love love love the art gallery downstairs as well, definitely a great addition to an already fantastic establishment. Each time I have been here every staff member I encounter has been very kind and helpful which I think just completes every visit! The only downside is the wait, as with every great place, however with my last visit the host had me download an app called no wait where I was able to make a reservation and watch how many people were ahead of me, so my friend and I were able to go hang out with a few coworkers while we waited."}
{"text":"I tried Soul a while ago, and there's a reason I haven't been back. Hubs really wants to go for a date night, but I really wasn't that impressed. It's really cute inside, but if you go at a popular time, you won't really get to see it. There is always a really long wait; 90 minutes to 2 1/2 hours - which is way too long for me to wait for food! I will say the cocktails and food are good, but go at an off-time to have a nicer experience."}
{"text":"not bad i guess... the wait was crazy but the place isn't so big. The pork belly tacos were good but it seems like everybody's making them now and nothing stood out about theirs. This is a place that makes everyone look cooler than they are though, the lights were super low and there was a DJ. The fries were salty and the drinks were amazing but way too expensive. I also tried the korean bbq wings which were spicy and decent. I'm not dying to get back there though. If i'm invited to join a group of friends, and I have nothing to do, I might join em."}
{"text":"Quite possibly my favorite Charlotte restaurant. Love the food and the atmosphere, try pork belly tacos, white bean dip, the cheese plate and the sushi."}
{"text":"We live just under three blocks away from Soul, we mostly have enjoyed the food, and we are pretty laid back people, so we gave this place several chances. Unfortunately, we have decided never to go back due to the consistently and rather shockingly nasty attitudes of the host staff. We have experienced it ourselves, as well as seeing it directed at other guests. On almost every visit, we have seen at least one party take their name off the list due to the rudeness of the hostess. Normally, when I read a review like this one, I take it with a grain of salt because I have worked in the restaurant business and I know how rude the customers themselves can be, but I assure you that neither we nor the others we have observed being treated rudely have done anything to bring it on ourselves. There is simply no food that is good enough to be worth this kind of disrespect. For good food AND friendly staff, walk a block in either direction to go to The Diamond or to Dish or, for sushi, take a quick drive to Niko. All of these places have food that is just as good and staff that DON'T treat you like the pile of dog poo they just stepped in."}
{"text":"I went a few months ago and still remember the tuna tacos I got here- definitely the way to go! The side salad was respectable but the lava cake was a bit much for me. Get the tacos! The atmosphere is great and seats open up a bit as the night goes on. I recommend sitting at the bar if you don't want to wait. Definitely worth the Uber trip on a layover in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This was the last stop while I was in the Charlotte area and it was the perfect ending to a great trip. Loved the cool vibe of the place. Didn't wait too long and got the best table in the place big comfy chairs and a couch with a nice long table aaah bliss! Started off with a Tito's winter mule, I'm really into ginger so I knew this was the drink for me, it was really really good. The menu is very extensive it was hard to narrow it down to a reasonable level of what we could actually eat. So here goes. Bone marrow, fried brussel sprouts, chicken skewers, serrano ham & manchego on toast,I know there was something else can't remember what and I was so into the meal I didn't get pics of everything...that alone let's you know how good it was...giggle. the bone marrow was a little too gamey for me, could be the type of meat it was from, have had it before & loved it, not so much here. Loooved the brussel sprouts the BEST i've had anywhere and I've had a lot of them :) the ham & cheese was also really good, didn't try the chicken as this was a day filled with food & drink but my dinner companions loved them. The service was great too. Would like to come back next time!"}
{"text":"Great cucumber mule seriously best mule I've had but was on the Yelp waiting list and waited over 21 minutes over my expected time and still wasn't seated. The worst part is we were so excited to try this place out we came to the front and the host literally passed us 3 times never said anything and once my husband said hey we have been standing here can you greet us she said oh I didn't know if you were taken care of. Wait what? So you thought to yourself oh they're good without throwing out the hey guys u been taken care of?? Disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"OMG, this place was flippin' amazing! We had the Brussel Sprouts, Steak & Gryo Skewers, Guac Stack, Spanikopita, Veal Short Ribs, and Huckleberry Ice Cream to top it off.  All of it was simply delicious!! I'm a total Foodie from out of town and stumbled upon this Gem on Yelp. Thank you Yelp, you never let me down!! We can't wait to go back to try more things on the menu, heard the Pork Belly Tacos are a must."}
{"text":"So we went back for dinner....understanding they don't take reservations.  So our party of three was told it would be about 45 minutes for a table.  Fine no worries, an hour came and went and we had show tickets so we went into ask what the hold up was...only to be told another 45 minutes.  WTF?  Hipster host who couldn't give a flip told us 'well we never can estimate a wait time,'  our response was Olive Garden seems to have no problem so surely Soul could manage to figure it out.  We looked inside and saw a four topper open and three two toppers....when asked why we can't have one of those tables we were told that 'well we had three people and there's only one table in the whole restaurant that they can seat three people at'  Cue the what the hell looks on our faces.  I mean seriously Soul.  You are trying way too hard and running off customers.  So evidently they refuse to seat a party of three at a four topper, or to push two, two top tables together.  So after wasting all of this time we went over to PIzza Peel and wolfed down our food.  Luckily we still made it to the Brian Regan show on time!  I am never ever stepping foot into Soul again."}
{"text":"Delish!  We are already planning our next trip bc after cleaning our plates we looked to our neighbors and thought \"we did this all wrong.\"  There was so much more to try and we were trying to being well thought out orderers. Should have just gone for it all.   The eggplant skewers, pork belly tacos, fries and the stuffed peppers were all great.  Is it crazy out of all that I loved the truffle fries the most? Pro tip: get that spicy ranch for dipping!  My BF liked the stuffed peppers the best.  All pleasing dishes and we left happy and ready to come back for the steak skewers and bone marrow!  Great dinner!  Second pro tip: plan to arrive right at 5 for no crowd or wait.  Make it an early date night. :)"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place. Ordered pork belly tacos, shrimp ceviche, shells n cheese, Brussels sprouts, short ribs, and chicken skin nachos. I didn't like any of the food. Chicken skins tasted burnt. We had a 2 hour wait. We were sat outside by the stairs where people waiting smoked cigarettes the entire time we were eating. Also a patron charged his cell phone directly behind my sister's chair and yelled to someone on the phone pushing against her chair the entire time to reach the plug. We were scared to say anything to him because he was yelling at his friends and large wads of cash were being exchanged. We did not feel safe during our meal. We read it was on the top 50 charlotte restaurants. It should not have even made the list."}
{"text":"Okay so we tried Soul Gastro...AMAZING food and signature cocktails!  You MUST have their Cucumber Mule...a delicious summertime drink!  The food is what we were there for though!  We started out with the short ribs and Korean BBQ...perfectly done!  Moved on to the porkbelly with watermelon tacos...also done to perfection!  The spicy with cool watermelon works well together.  We then ordered sushi and had Gidzilla roll and dragon roll...five stars!  I highly recommend this place for adults...not a kid place for sure...is very small and not reall suitable for strollers and whatnot. We will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Charlotte restaurants.  A great place to take out of town guests that enjoy a hip atmosphere in a cool part of town (Plaza Midwood).   I LOVE small plates where you can taste a number of different dishes and that is exactly what SOUL offers up.  On my last visit I must have tasted ten different dishes on our table and all of them were amazing!     TIP: Be prepared to wait.  This place is small, and there isn't much room for large parties."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I've only been here twice but it's practically perfect every time. I kinda want to give it 5 stars but I rarely do that unless something extraordinary happened. As for Sol, it's good. Very good. The food, cocktails, atmosphere and music are on point. The vibe is very cosmopolitan and I love that. I feel like I'm at a spot in New York when I'm there. I wish there were more places in CLT with this cosmo vibe.  My second visit was recent. I ate at the bar and the bartenders while cordial weren't very talkative so I pulled a member of the staff who was just walking by and asked him for recommendations. He wasn't even my server but he eagerly stopped and spent a good bit of time with me to offer several suggestions. His name is Drew and he was fantastic!  I had their version of the Moscow Mule to drink. They have a different name for it. I can't remember what they call it but it's damn good. I also had the pork belly tacos, goat cheese balls, and chocolate bread pudding for dessert. Every item was cooked to perfection. Literally mouthwatering.  My only con is that the place is really small. Apparently the wait can be off the chain. I went 30 mins after they opened and there was already a wait but I was by myself so I snagged the one open seat at the bar and it was perfect.   Also it's pricey. All the items are tapas. By the time you order a few plates and drinks, you will have already racked up a hefty tab but it's well worth it.  Love love love this place and highly recommend it, especially if you have friends in town. That way, you can show them what a cool kid you are :) I can't wait to go back....but it will need to be for a special occasion or a splurge."}
{"text":"The food at Soul is outstanding!  The atmosphere is definitely an upscale casual.  I am comfortable going in a skirt or jeans.  It's a great place for a friend outing or a date night.  The Pork Belly Tacos are by far my favorite thing on the menu, but I have ventured out from the norm and have loved everything I ordered.......Dirty South Nachos (so bad, yet so good.)  If you have not yet been to Soul, you must try it.  Be prepared for a wait because this is a very small, quaint establishment, but it is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Can get pretty crowded at night but it's still a fun, cool vibe with great music food and drinks!"}
{"text":"The menu is very limited for someone with a gluten allergy to begin with. I ordered the duck panini without the bread and the chef refused. Flat out refused due to the effect on presentation. So much for customer service. Apparently how food looks is Far more important than providing food a patron can eat while taking into consideration medical issues."}
{"text":"#1 place in plaza midwood. Will take some time to sit down most days, but for me that speaks for how bomb the food is. Once you eat it you will understand. A+"}
{"text":"If there's anything you should try, try the Asian glazed pork belly tacos! This was by far the most unique dish of the night - sweet and savory with rich and refreshing all combined in one. By appearance, three little cubes of watermelon sitting on top of three little chunks of pork belly don't look like a lot, but these small tacos sure pack a punch.   The shrimp ceviche in coconut milk was also a fun and different interpretation on ceviche - sweet, creamy, and not at all acidic.  Be sure to arrive early or expect a looong wait."}
{"text":"Everything was incredible!! Food, drinks, music, atmosphere, service. Can't go wrong with the pork belly and watermelon tacos."}
{"text":"The food was GREAT! Highly recommend the fries and the Korean BBQ wings! The facility is small so be prepared to wait for a seat. We opted to sit outside last night under the heat lamps it was perfect and much quieter! What you waiting for check this place out!"}
{"text":"Gotta get the pork belly tacos, seriously, MIND BLOWING amazing. Sushi is always fresh and delicious and presentation beautifully done. Last visit, my friend ordered the lamb lollipops and raved about it. Moscow mule was on point. Definitely one of my top three favorite restaurants in Charlotte. The only downside is the wait time to get a table. I usually end up sitting at the bar (which is still great and full service)."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spot to hang out with my bf! Lots of selections to choose from but my absolute favorite is their bone marrow (huge fan!) and pork belly tacooooosssssss OMG to die for and a must try when you go here! Loves!!!!!!?"}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype. After reading the reviews I finally decided to go. I attempted to go a couple of times on a week night and it was always a 2 hour wait. Finally I decided to go on a Sunday night and no wait. My bf and I were seated in the corner under the speakers.  I love music in the background while eating out but it was a challenge ending a sentence with Huh.lol. our waiter african American with locs was pleasant and patient when it came to explaining the menu.   Being a foodie from NY I tasted all kinds of food and open to trying various foods. We wanted to keep it simple and ordered the teriyaki wings which were not the greatest. The sauce had a strange taste I never tasted before. I also had the spinach pockets. Not what I expected. B had the gyro which had a strange taste. So not like him to leave food on his plate.   Conclusion: we will not be returning. Everything is not good for everybody."}
{"text":"Soul is overrated, in my opinion. The food isn't bad, but nothing to write home about. The neighborhood is cool, though."}
{"text":"Some of the best tapas in the Queen city. Pork belly tacos and grilled caesar salad are two of my favorites. Sushi is also excellent"}
{"text":"I recommend the goat cheese flatbread, wings and avocado stack but we didn't care for the hummus or the short ribs."}
{"text":"When somebody is visiting me in town..this is my spot to take them!! Ambience, food, vibe, drinks. Amazing place. Haven't had a chance to go in a couple months...I need to make a trip back I'm craving it...."}
{"text":"GREAT food, atmosphere, menu, and service! Been trying to go here for a while now but the wait was always 2 hrs! But that's how you know it must be good! So o kept trying. Finally a friend and I went earlier in the evening, around 5:30 on a Saturday and sat right down, although still pretty busy. Laid back atmosphere with bar seating, table/booth, and even couches and chairs. Being tapas you can tell people hang out for hours casually and munch. Probably why the wait is so long. However, great place for dates! Unique menu would allow for great conversation. And our server was a delight as well."}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant in Charlotte. Tuna Tacos are the stuff dreams are made of. Pork Belly Tacos, Soul Roll, Shrimp Ceviche, Wild Mushrooms on Toast, Fried Oysters = Yes. And the cocktails are even better if that's possible. Their version of a Moscow Mule is deadly good. PLAN TO WAIT for a table -- this way you won't be disappointed. If you go at any time that people would consider having dinner, there WILL be a wait. No matter what day. Just give them your cell number and head downstairs to Twenty-Two for a beer or glass of wine. Done and done."}
{"text":"I love love love the ambience. The music definitely played a huge role in the experience. The DJ is a master of mixing and he proves it in his  set. I came one evening to have the infamous pork belly tacos. I expected them to be great. What I got was way more amazing. They're so simple, pieces of pork belly and watermelon salsa wrapped in a tortilla. Looking at them, you think \"seriously, what's the hype all about?\" But as soon as you take a bite, it all makes sense. It's pure art. A flavor that you dream about but have never tasted- until now. I loved the experience. I definitely plan to come back."}
{"text":"Super small Portions! Sushi is awesome but some of the appetizers were so so. It's defiantly the place to go if u wanna be in the scene."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere Great food only down fall is wait time but well worth it! The drinks are on time and keep you occupied why you wait"}
{"text":"I want to give this place more stars because the food and drinks that I enjoy here are absolutely delicious...the sashimi tacos make me dance... The bacony Brussels sprout are perfection... Don't get me started on their spin on \"nachos\". Fried chicken skin smothered in pimento cheese and speckled with pickled okra?!  Who is the evil genius behind this??? While there are a few misses the food is good! They lose two stars for spotty service unfortunately On more than two occasions I have visited and been treated like a peasant.  One instance it was super busy and I had eventually ordered drinks at the bar.  The bartender handed me a receipt and pen to sign but there was literally no where to rest the paper to sign with two drinks in my hand and several people just leaning along the bar I found a clear spot at the end of the bar to get it done. I put the drinks down and not even two seconds later I am scolded by some dude organizing receipts or something at the end of the bar saying I can't use the space.  I told him I was just trying to sign and pay and he gave me the Kanye shrug... Another time we my group of four was told we had to wait about an hour for seating at midnight and there were several open tables...we eventually and rebelliously just sat down and were served (surprise surprise no one came to claim the 'reserved' tables) I have a few other similar stories.  Why do I return?  Because the food and drinks are good(and usually I get outvoted). But please work on the service"}
{"text":"The glazed pork belly and cucumber Moscow mule is why I come to Soul Gastro! It's unbelievably Scrumptious!!! They also have sushi with poke which is amaaaaazzing! Anytime I need quick bites or a drink, this is my go to."}
{"text":"If you ask yourself what you want for dinner and think \"I would really like some good fusion food, but slightly overpriced in a cramped dark hipster-ish setting with mediocre service.\" This is your place.  Be ready to wait! When I say wait I mean wait like 4 hours for a table! They don't take reservations which is a pain, but if your party is small and you get there early it can be tolerable. If you get there on a Saturday night with more than 2 people you will be waiting forever. My suggestion is put your name down and go to whiskey warehouse or common market and have a drink where you are not so cramped, then walkover when your table is ready.   Went on a Saturday once and put our name down for a table for 8 at 6:30, we were not seated until 11:15.   Food overall its good, however I don't get what all the hype is about...they put watermelon on some pork belly and you would think they invented the PB&J, it's good don't get me wrong, but common people it's not that good.  Place is great if you and the significant other want a date night, but I wouldn't come here with a group of friends it's just way too tiny and cramped. Not to mention the food comes out when it's ready not all at once, and in a group its strange when some people have food and some people don't."}
{"text":"What a great find this place is Located in the hot trending Uptown area of Charlotte  The walk up the staircase to the second floor balcony reminded me of the French quarter in New Orleans. It was about 9:30 pm on a Tuesday and the place was packed! I liked the dimly lit and dark wood ambience. A well stocked bar, decent wine and sake list  We sat and dined at the bar. The menu is very gastro pub eclectic with things from sushi to a Korean take on wings to ramen with goat cheese balls to ahi tacos to pork belly with watermelon tacos.   The thing is everything is really good  It was now about 11 pm and the place was getting even busier and the music playing from the DJ was getting a little louder and better.   I kept thinking how much I was enjoying this place and the food and if I lived in Charlotte I would be here quite often  Time for another drink!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Soul!  If your are looking for a fun place to eat with friends ( and the best it gets for the price), there is no place I would rather go in Charlotte.  I went their for my birthday dinner this past Friday.  The Soul Roll was amazing, the sushi was so fresh.  There is always a good dj spinning in the background.  Yes, i waited an hour for a table, but who cares?  I was sipping cava on the porch with my friends, nobody was complaining.  I am pretty sure by now, I have tried everything on the menu at least once.  Some favs:  Sashimi tuna tacos, shrimp ceviche, sticky veal short ribs, the Soul roll, and if you have room for sweets: red velvet cup cake   I think the sushi keeps getting better, I do want to try the cheese plate though, looked really good at the table next to me,( I usually get the ham plate).  The prices are more than reasonable; I always leave good and full and without buyers remorse...  We need more places like this in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Tried the avocado salad and pork belly watermelon tacos.  The tacos were pretty good and so was the avocado salad, but not good enough to come back.  The avocado had to much brown on it, that kinda turned my stomach.  The environment was horrible, some drunk girl was making out with her boyfriend blocking the way out in the middle of the stair case.  She became very aggressive making me feel like she was gonna push me down the stairs when I was trying to get past them. They need security working that area, it's a long way down the stairs if you were to get pushed.  At the very least the management should have the aggressive behavior from their drunk customers under control. Things could have escalated very quickly to a major injury leading to a law suit.    Soul Gastro you might wanna address this issue with your management team before something serious happens to someone here.  Not a safe environment. To many angry drunk people  with no one monitoring their behavior."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a work dinner on a slow Monday night - luckily we got there early and had plenty of seating options.   Ordered the dip trio, the jalepeno sushi roll, the pork belly taco's and the salmon in filo. All top-notch, especially the pork belly taco's (very addictive and the watermelon on top is perfect).  Only gripe is that most of the beer specials were by the bottle versus on-tap. As usual atmosphere was cool - funky, dark and loud.   Great option for a dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Update time! We finally made it back for dinner last night and suffered only an hour wait. Soul is a busy place, let me tell you. While it IS very small, I can see why it takes so long to be seated: it's not a normal restaurant where one would order their meal, have it delivered, eat it, and then leave. No, not at Soul. Once we were seated we ordered a round of tapas... which did come out rather quickly... ate them... decided we wanted to order more... and more. This is a process in itself. Our group of 4 agreed on 3-4 dishes at a time, probably totalling 8-10 tapas and 2 cupcakes during our visit. Soul is known for their sushi, but I personally thought the lamb skewers, brussel sprouts, pork tacos and fried clams (the special) were my personal favorites. Sadly I woke up in the middle of the night with a HORRIBLE stomach ache- a lot of fried food, and while it comes in small portions, it is deceiving. Beware. We have been eating a lot of meatless/healthy/raw lately, so don't let the size of the tapas fool you. That stuff is heavy. Ah- and how can I forget the fried goat cheese? It was divine. No wonder my stomach hated me last night. :)"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first experience at Soul.  I've heard nothing but great things about this place so I was really excited to try it.  We had a party of 4 and all of ordered a variety of dishes to try.  The food and service was outstanding (thanks Marlon)!"}
{"text":"Super hip resto near boring uptown. Alison was super cool and all her suggestions were on point. We tried the bone marrow, the Brussel sprouts, and the hamachi, hands down the best hamachi dish I ever had! The ponzu sauce was the best one, too. Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Minus the long wait time, the food and drinks were great! Service was good as well. The atmosphere is on point. Too bad I'm not from here otherwise I'd be at this spot quite often."}
{"text":"Lamb lollipops yum Tuna tacos were delish Loved the truffled fries"}
{"text":"First time in the little town of Charlotte and a friend brought me here for drinks.  She knows how profound my desire for craft cocktails runs, so this was our first stop for the evening.  It did not disappoint.    First off I love the comfy darkness of this place.  Reminds me of stepping into a speakeasy where you kick your shitty sunny ass day off at the door and melt into a bar stool or cozy chair and sip into a blissful state of relaxation.  I loved the exposed brick, the well thought out lighting and the art.   The bartender that evening was courteous and prompt.  She answered all of our questions without hesitation or any notable sense of annoyance.  She whipped us up some fabulous drinks as well.  We ordered the Flip'n Branca and Flamed Martin off the spring 15 cocktail menu.  Both so scrumptious!!    Though this review is only for a two drink experience - the food coming out of the kitchen looked amazing and I'd certainly give this place a go again!"}
{"text":"Great food and.the servers are total pros but... dont expect to.be seated by any priority except profit.  If you come at a busy hour be prepared to watch as parties who arrive long after you are seated before you, based on their profitability."}
{"text":"Always fantastic. If you can deal with the wait to get a table, you'll love the craft cocktails, small plates and out of this world sushi. Soul roll, lamb lolly pops, fried chicken wings, truffle fries, avocado stack and are a few of my favorites!  Beware you must walk up some metal stairs on the side of the building to get into Soul and I am not aware of a good option if climbing those stairs is unrealistic for you.   The funky atmosphere with exposed brick and vintage wood floors, live DJ at night, great service with fun servers and consistently great food bring me back over and over for repeated delight."}
{"text":"I want to start out by stating that I've actually been here a handful of times but it was before my time on ye ol' Yelp. This isn't some one night five star fling review ;) Soul consistently delivers when it comes to food and drink.  Soul is a cozy, hip restaurant that has an upstairs entrance. It also boasts a patio (that's heated during the winter months) which provides an abbreviated view of the skyline. They have a beautiful bar that's pretty much the centerpiece of the space. Ladies: there's an added bonus for bar seating. They have purse hooks!! As for restaurant seating? well...I'm not lying when I say it's cozy. There are about two-three booths and then rest of the seating consists of tables that can be grouped together or broken a part for two person seating. Trust me, you'll be so focused enjoying every bite of your food that you won't be worried about your proximity to your neighbor(s).  Back to the bar....the bartenders make THE BEST DRINKS. I've enjoyed their  summer version of the moscow mule which includes cucumber - yum - and their winter version called the winter's mule. The winter's mule is hands down my favorite drink and I was that person sucking down every last drop of the drink through her straw.  As for the food....there is so much to say. The place covers Asian, Greek, Spanish, American cuisines with such understated flair and sophistication. Clearly there's a reason why the pork belly tacos are so well-documented because THEY ARE DELICIOUS. Simply put, you absolutely must get those if/when you go there. It's like a rule. Every time I've been to Soul, I always get a sushi roll of some sort. They are very creative with the flavors and I'm always pleased.   Soul does not have a designated parking lot. Don't even bother thinking about parking in the CVS lot because they will either tow your car or yell at you when you walk back to your car (mentioning this from past experience). If you're lucky, grab a spot in the lot that's across Pizza Peel/The Dish and walk over or park in the Bistro La Bon/Healthy Home Market lot. Also, don't even think about not having to wait on a weekend night. If you're like me and don't enjoy waiting long periods of time for food (although this place is worth it), come on a Tuesday/Wednesday evening.  Being that the place serves tapas-style plates, be prepared to spend a little more $$$. It's by no means a cheap place (well...depending on your appetite) and it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"Came here on the recommendation of my friend and it did not disappoint. Monday night so we were able to walk right in at 7pm. Usually it's a long wait to be seated. It's a quaint place and a little loud but that just adds to the ambience. Service was great. Love how more than one person takes care of each table. Drinks were always full and the tapas style allowed us to try a huge variety of delicious food. Don't go and not get the pork belly tacos or the brussel sprouts!"}
{"text":"Besides the fact that its hard to get a table some nights (which is good for Soul) this place is a must go for a sexy date, sushi craving, late night cocktail, hipster watching, sunset photographing, and soul music. The place just has a buzz about it and the staff is phenomenal. Some of the bartenders are without a doubt the best in charlotte. Try the veal fries....they're balls."}
{"text":"Since I'm review #615, I'll keep it short!  - Get there a few minutes before 5:00 to make sure you get a seat. At 4:55 on a Saturday, we were the 4th group in line. - Get the pork belly tacos (the watermelon slice makes it), pan con tomate (our waiter suggested it, we were leery, absolutely delicious), mini burgers (mmm, onion ring on top), duck bahn fit (literally the best thing we put in our mouths). - Skip the fried meatballs (pretty dry without the tzatziki sauce) - My friend is Greek, and she said the Greek salad was spot on like her mom makes. I tried some of the feta with oregano, and it was deeelicious. - For dessert, we got the cupcake of the day (goat cheese with raspberry topping), and it was just ok. Thankfully, we also got the banana phyllo turnovers, which was basically warm chocolate and salted caramel in phyllo dough with a frozen banana on the side. Magical."}
{"text":"Awesome.   Fish Tacos, meatballs, lamb, and definately the pork belly tacos.   YUM."}
{"text":"Recommended to me for a long time, finally visited. Worth the wait.  Will be back.    Highlights: Pork belly tacos Sushi Skewers Mussels Wine Cocktails  Lowlights: After the sushi, the tuna tacos were underwhelming.   Brussel sprouts"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Every time I'm back in Charlotte, this is the place to go to. Items on the menu always come out amazing - guacamole stack, lemon chicken skewers, white bean and goat cheese dip, hummus dip, fried goat cheese on bruschetta, herb cheese stuffed piquillo peppers, pork belly tacos, fried meatballs, any of the sushi options. Amazing.  Downfall - Doesn't take reservations, so expect a long wait for nights. Also, have to find street parking in the area. If you park at Sherwin Williams after it closes, then you're fine - but during business hours, same as CVS, beware of getting towed."}
{"text":"LOVED this place! I had the best time at Soul, and the food was to die for. Our waitress was very nice, the wine was delicious, and although it was small and we had to sit at the bar to wait for a table for about 30 minutes, the bartenders were attentive and the time flew by. I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience from the moment we walked in the door , service was great , food was delicious !"}
{"text":"When my friends told me about this place in Charlotte that had a large variety of food and they started listing out the food, I thought they were just pulling my leg. Literally they were talking about tacos, wings, sushi, ramen, mac and cheese, paninis, and the list goes on. When I heard of all the choices, I thought it must be one of those spots that don't do anything really well so they just go for pure diversity so while I was apprehensive about heading to this joint as my last meal for my final work trip to Charlotte, I decided to be open minded and give it a shot. This joint is located in an area which has apparently gone through a lot of modifications/upgrades over the recent years according to my friend. The spot itself is up a flight of stairs and there are some patio seats outside and the moment you step inside, you see a bar along with a few booths and tables around.   The spot has a policy of only seating tables when your entire party has arrived so something to keep in mind if you are going with a large group. We were seated quickly given our group was present and we were given menus quickly after. Sure enough this place has a ton of options and while we had a tough time narrowing it down, we went with Asian Glazed pork belly tacos, lamb lollipops, Dirty South Nachos, Shells and Cheese, Korean Chicken Wings, the Cuban panini, and the Red Dragon Roll. We also ordered off the drink menu as the bar had an extensive menu so should be a lot of options for any type of drinker. The Asian Glazed pork belly tacos were out first and they were good. The pork belly was tender and while the watermelon chunks were a bit big, it actually was not overwhelming. A solid fusion starter for sure. The Dirty south Nachos were out next and these were really good although the presentation of it was quite interesting. The pimento cheese fondue was good but it wasn't as spicy as I was hoping for and ended up being just a bit too much cheese for me. The lamb lollipops were by far my least favorite and I would recommend staying away from it. The meat was a bit tough to eat and there wasn't a ton of flavor on this but we ended up ordering enough food to not be starving. The Shells and cheese were good and while I did not think the BBQ pork would go well, it ended up being a solid dish and I was pleasantly surprised. The Korean chicken wings were Good and I bet they are probably considered very good given the lack of Korean restaurants in Charlotte. A good dish for the local market so props to them for it. The Cuban panini was very solid and definitely a crowd pleaser. The meats were tender and it was the right balance of all the ingredients to make it a tasty panini. The roll that we ordered ended up being solid for rolls. I don't eat too many rolls anymore but it tasted like a solid roll and the fish quality was good surprisingly. A hidden surprise and I think something that would do well in the CLT market.  All in all, I think the food was good at this joint. I actually want to give this joint a lot of props for trying a lot of different fusion combinations that while sound weird, actually ended up being Good in the end. I certainly think that it's a solid spot in the CLT dining scene and want to give them props for the risks they are taking for these unique recipes."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi, tasty shrimp ceviche and their winter mule is my fave. Awesome ambience also!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this place blew my mind. Came here with friends on a late night Friday for some drinks and small plates. We were seated at the outdoor balcony within 5 minutes of walking up and the view of the Charlotte skyline was pretty cool at night. Our server was super chill and gave some great recommendations on items to try since it was our first time. We ate about everything on the menu haha. Never in my life could I have thought to order hummus, Korean bbq wings, pecan seared trout, sushi rolls, flatbreads, or aioli french fries and been so impressed with the quality or the inventiveness of the kitchen. I even pitched in and invented my own plate- a cheese grilled cheese stuffed with marinated baby portobello mushrooms. Everything was spectacular! I highly recommend checking this place out of you're in town and want to break away from a typical sit down restaurant. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty sure the hubs and I have found our new favorite date spot! We had an awesome experience at Soul this past Friday night. We took the advice of others on here and put our names on the wait list online. By the time we made it over to Soul, we only had to wait about 10 minutes for our table. Now, I will agree with others that they squeeze you in there tight (which is typically not my cup of tea). BUT after a few delicious cocktails, my husband and I suddenly didn't care what the couple at the table next to us was chatting about.   The food OH the food! Almost everything we had was superb. We of course ordered the Asian pork belly tacos (which I dream about now, thanks Soul), a sushi roll (I can't remember the name), the fried goat cheese bruschetta, the fried Brussels sprouts (not a fan, I thought they were a little too charred), and stuffed shells with pork BBQ (!!!). Our waiter was fantastic (I can't remember his name, unfortunately) and we liked the fact that the tapas came out one right after the other (instead of feeling overwhelmed by all of them at the same time). We thoroughly enjoyed gorging ourselves and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I want to call this place an amazing hidden gem but I am afraid the word is out. Very rarely can you find a place like this that has it all. Great service, great food and reasonable \"tapas\" pricing. This, for me, is one of those places you go to and then want to go again the next day. Although I am not from Charlotte, I will make it a point to get me some Soul every time I am in town!"}
{"text":"We just came for the Packers game, we from Cali. I was craving for sushi and pitas, found this gem! Food was amazing, we had fire pita, mini burgers, tuna tacos, lamb pita, Cali roll and the chocolate  bread pudding. The ambience is excellent, great music!  I did my reservation using yelp. No waiting at all. Service was phenomenal and friendly !!! Luv this place!"}
{"text":"I came here based on the BuzzFeed article & the reviews for their pork belly \"taco\". While I knew this was a hipster tapa joint, I honestly expected more from a highly regarded pork belly taco. Isn't North Carolina known for it's BBQ & hence amazing meat preparation?  The pork belly was chewy vs melt in your mouth tastiness. Plus it was really just a pork belly tapa vs a taco because there was no way the measly flour shell could wrap around the large pork + watermelon layers.  It was decently busy, but Sunday busy so I expected better service. Honestly it nailed all the hipster bar cliches. Busy with loud music, over priced attempts at fusion food & prohibition style cocktails & stand offish people.   I'd come here with friends for a drink on a weekday, but not worth the hype IMO."}
{"text":"I cannot rave about this place enough! This restaurant is super popular -- with its unique cocktails, modern romantic decor, and tapas style menu this place is sure to hit the spot for dinner. It gets very popular though so I recommend trying to get there before 6 o'clock. They also do not take reservations and will not seat you unless your whole party is there. But back to the food: ordering a bunch of different tapas (and even sushi rolls) is the way to go. I love the Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos -- the pork is cooked to such perfection that it literally does melt in your mouth, a very popular tapa among customers. The Lamb Pops are also really good, which are smothered in rosemary, pecorino and pepper. Soul also has good sushi, in which I recommend the Charlotte roll, with tempura shrimp inside. Just order a little bit of everything and enjoy!"}
{"text":"We walked in here and got bar seats. We were taken Extremely good care of by the bar tenders. We ordered the special cup cake of the day ( soco lime) but were disappointed. The bar tender noticed the unfinished cup cake and offered to replace it- he then got me the red velvet which was Yumm. We weren't charged for the soco lime cupcake. This is what I call service. Highly recommend this place. Great music good people."}
{"text":"Really excellent! Great service, delicious cocktails, good date night or girls night atmosphere. Shrimp ceviche with plantains and pan con tomate were mind-blowing. The house cocktails are very well crafted; not too sweet and lots of flavor. Soul roll was a little bland, as was the baba ganoush. Next time we are saving room for pork belly tacos and bone marrow. I think this will become one of our go-to date night places!"}
{"text":"My friends and I probably come here far too often, but with good reason. We have never had a less than stellar experience here. From the food, drinks, ambient music, and staff, it truly is an experience from start to finish. When I first moved to plaza midwood, my roommate and I came here to celebrate. I was in love with the seasonal mules, and other unique cocktails. It's a rite of passage to get the pork belly tacos, but there are so many other delicious options! The dirty south nachos sound odd (especially to a northerner like me), but they are just too good to pass up. It bothers some people that they don't take reservations, but as with any special or luxury experience, they don't offer them because they don't have to. They know the value of their venue and truthfully, I don't mind sitting at the bar for 2 hours prior to my meal and loading up on cocktails. Go, as fast as you can."}
{"text":"I loved this place!  I definitely recommend downloading the \"nowait\" app to make sure that you don't have to wait for a table for two hours.  We got a few plates - the dirty south nachos, fried meatballs, shells & cheese, and the Ki roll.  My favorites were the Ki roll and the shells & cheese (which were PHENOMINAL!!).  The dirty south nachos were good but different, and the fried meatballs were good but a little dry.  I got an amazing cucumber vodka mojito to drink, which was a perfect pallet refresher!  The interior is super cute and very intimate."}
{"text":"I have no idea where to start. One of my favorite places ever. Fun experience for small groups or couples. LONG wait, just expect it. Favorites were the winter mule and hibachi jalape√±o sashimi. Dynamic roll was good too but then again everything we tried was."}
{"text":"Favorite Tapas spot in Charlotte!!  Pork Belly tacos is the most surprising enjoyable dish that I order every time.  Lamb Lollypops are also amazing. Can't go wrong with with any order.  Love the neighborhood and environment, always work the wait.   Disclaimer: I love Pimento Cheese but the Dirty South Nachos wasn't for me....still not enough for me to feel this place wasn't worth 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"If you are the type of person who enjoys appetizers more than meals and appreciates variety, then head to Charlottes hipster neighborhood, Plaza Midwood, and try a few tapas from this restaurant. Soul Gastrolounge caters to a unique crowd and is located on the second floor of a building. There is outdoor and indoor seating. I tried the ramen noodle bowl with veil meet and portebello mushrooms, alongside the chicken pita and mini burgers which were all delicious!! They also serve cucumber water which is rather refreshing. I'll definitely be making a few more stops to try out other delicious tapas like the Korean BBQ and avocado salad."}
{"text":"Love this eclectic hot spot. Indoor and outdoor seating. DJ spinning the tunes. We ate at the bar where we enjoyed great service. They even stock my favorite EFFEN Black Cherry Vodka! Started with an order of the boursin cheese stuffed piquillo peppers on bruscetta...to die for! Heard that the sushi was the best in town so being a non-sushi eater, I decided on the vegetable roll. I'll go back now for that alone now! Finished with a red velvet cupcake and also homemade pistachio ice cream. A great experience...."}
{"text":"Vegetarian options here are limited but delicious. Here's a list of what we ordered with a review:  1. Hummus if the day (tahini honey) - This was good but not great! Would've been better if it had a flavourful hit of garlic to it. Not the best. The pita chips that came with it we nice and healthy (since they were baked not fried).  2. Eggplant Parmesan skewers - This was the best dish I tried in soul! The eggplant and cheese was cut into perfect chunks and breaded and crisped to perfection. The marinara sauce (which I hope was made in the house and not store bought) was great to accompany the dish. All in all perfect! Must try for everyone.  3. Flatbread - Was good. The pesto was delicious although, the honey braised garlic made it somewhat sweet (which is the point) but didn't do anything. If you love cheese and pesto on bread, go for it!  Pita sandwich with falafel - Again, a great dish. Nothing innovative here, but a good soft pita with tomatoes and tender tasty falafels. I liked it! Vegetarians will definitely love this one.   Dessert - chocolate brioche cake with ice cream - Good warm cake with nuts and tasty caramel syrup to moisten it while the ice cream melts! Good dessert!  And after so much food, what we paid was unbelievably reasonable (just $38) ! That's the best part.. it's gourmet food at cheap pricing!   I've been waiting to go to this place since forever. Will definitely go back to try other vegetarian options (and the eggplant parmesan skewers as well) :D"}
{"text":"Myself and several friends went to Soul for a girls night out  today! The first thing i must  mention is this place is tiny! I now understand why most reviews state there is typically a wait. Myself and two other members of my party arrived around 6:10pm. At this time, there was no wait. We did have to wait for the majority of our party to arrive prior to us  being seated. We were placed in a booth, that was suppose to accommodate 8 people. It's a great that  only 7 of us were present- we were packed in the booth like sardines. Regarding the food- it was everything the reviews mentioned. I had the guacamole stack- try it if you are a fan of avocado, the flatbread- my favorite, and the truffle fries, my second favorite. I also tried the Korean wings- too spicy for my taste, fried meatballs- just ok, nothing special, lemon chicken skewer-they were ok, I would not order them again, and a host of other items. The last thing I tried was the pistachio ice cream. It was no bueno!!! It was completely tasteless. The server was nice enough to remove it from my tab. I am a foodie, and have to give credit when credit is due. The presentation of the food is good but more importantly the taste  is what works for Soul. I would record this for a smaller group due to the size being so small!"}
{"text":"The wait here is incredibly long on weekends, they do not take reservations but use an App called NoWait. Even using the App to get a seat we had to wait about an hour and a half.   But, it was well worth the wait! The food here is amazing, its predominantly a seafood/Asian cuisine menu that includes: multiple sushi's, bone marrow plates, rocky mountain oysters ;) and a variety of craft cocktails. The atmosphere is very trendy/hipster with a nice combination of mild electronic music playing. I would highly recommend this place for dates, dinner parties or a casual drink."}
{"text":"Everything we had was GREAT! but the Pork belly tacos and Lamb lollipops were AMAZING!  A really fun place to go, but get there early...the secrets out and the place fills up fast!"}
{"text":"Cocktails & tapas! Whether you are with friends or on a date this place is fabulous. The staff are friendly, atmosphere is fun, and the food.... YES PLEASE! I may as well list the entire menu because there is not one bad thing on it!"}
{"text":"Soul is a fantastic Gastrolounge, really cool ambiance like an Old Irish Pub.  Bartender Billy is really knowledgeable and takes care of you.  The Food:  Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos, Very flavorful and the watermelon cube packs a bite.  Duck Bahn Fit, Hello Foie Gras & Duck Confit...just eat it"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place. Very busy the night we went but we were able to grab a few seats at the bar. My friends and I ordered a variety of tapas, including hummus, chimichurri beef skewers, grilled cheese, fried meatballs and another I can't recall. It was all good but of all things, it was the grilled cheese that I enjoyed the most. It included provolone, mozzarella and kasseri cheeses. The kasseri made all the difference. It added a saltiness to the sandwich which really gave it great flavor.  The carrot cupcake was also quite tasty.   The service was friendly and very attentive, especially since the bartender was extremely busy. Cool atmosphere. I'll definitely return when I visit Charlotte again."}
{"text":"Pork belly tacos. That's all you need to know.   I think once a year or so, however rich or poor you are, you need to try to find a restaurant with good reviews and just buy whatever the heck you want. This was my 2014 restaurant I did that with. You'll spend a bit because the plates are small, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place -- the food, the atmosphere, everything (well, except the wait)! The watermelon pork belly tacos are to die for! I highly recommend ordering those. Once again, a small plate/tapas style restaurant (my fav)! Great ambiance for a group of friends or even date night."}
{"text":"I looove this place  if you haven't been to Soul and you want a chill, trendy yet amazingly delicious dinner then you got to come here. They have a wide range of food options but I always get their sushi because it's so delicious and fresh. I love the dark atmosphere and the type of music they play. I would recommend reserving a seat ahead of time because they wait can be a little lengthy."}
{"text":"I've lived in SF and Paris, I spent some time in NYC. I also had very high expectations of this place, since everyone in Charlotte keeps talking about it. The verdict? It's GOOD. It's VERY good. Get Red Dragon Roll and Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos (amazing).  P.S. It's not cheap. A cocktail will cost you the same amount of money as if it was Paris. It's worth it though."}
{"text":"This is a place I would imagine Anthony Bourdain would visit if he came to Charlotte.  It's fine dining without the stuffy feel, the vibe is chill with a live dj and unique seating options. They serve mainly tapas/small plates so you have the opportunity to sample a wide variety of food.  The food is incredible. Top favorites include the ceviche, bone marrow, and sushi. If nothing else, try those 3, you won't be disappointed.   The prices are also reasonable. We were a party of 3 and wound up paying around $50 per person, including cocktails and all of the tapas we ordered."}
{"text":"Big fan of Soul!  Went on a date on a Tuesday night.  A bit tight for a date- tables are close together.  We quickly realized the couple next to us was also on a date by the awkward convos haha!!  We did antipasti salad and a bunch of different skewers, all awesome.  My fav was the chimichurri beef.  Yummmmmm!!!!  Service was good, very hipster crowd as far as employees.  Mixed crowd as far as customers.  Excited to try it again!"}
{"text":"You're going to wait for a table for a looooong time. Kill the time by grabbing some wine or beer at 22 or getting a small bite to eat at Fuel (their garlic knots are to die for). Once you get your table, you'll soon realize the wait was worth it! Order 2-3 plates/person and share!"}
{"text":"One of Charlotte's best hidden gems!  The menu is a cross among American, Greek, Spanish & Japanese cuisines.  The music is excellent (mostly lounge/house music.)  Great view of uptown....my only complaint would be that it always gets packed especially on the weekends and a couple of times me and some friends actually waited over an hour for a table."}
{"text":"There aren't letters in the human language that can be compiled to translate the amount of incredible this place is.  I travel nonstop for work and make it a mission to find cool, unique places everywhere I go, and this place is by far the best food stuffery I've ever been too.  Food Atmosphere Service View  All in one package. Soul, you win. Everything.  Oh! And get the Pork Belly Tacos. Like stop reading this right now and just yell, \"Pork Belly!\" Do it. Right now.  Seriously. Right now."}
{"text":"Soul Gastrolounge is awesome and has very good food. The menu has something for everyone - there's sushi, mac n cheese, tacos, flatbreads etc. Everything we ate was delicious but it wasn't unique enough that I would wait two hours again (there is always a wait for a table at this restaurant)"}
{"text":"is it fair to review a place if you've never eaten there?   i will probably never go back based on how the hostess acted upon our arrival. i've never encountered such a rude person in the hospitality industry. as a hostess, your job is to greet people, welcome them and make them feel at home. i was appalled by the way she treated us and will probably never return due to how unpleasent she was. customer service is key."}
{"text":"This was an incredible and worth-while gem of Charlotte. It's small and eclectic and wouldn't be out of place in a hipster-Brooklyn setting (including the 2-hour wait time). We especially liked their style of serving the dishes as they were prepared rather than being overwhelmed with all the food all at once (it also meant that we could start eating fairly quickly since we were super hungry!).  Here's a helpful outline of how to do Soul Gastrolounge right:  First, download and use the NoWait app to secure your place in line at this restaurant. It saved us over an hour of waiting.   Second, you'll need to find parking as there's no parking lot. We went on a Saturday night around 7:30pm and we're only *just* lucky to have found a spot on the same street.   Third, it's helpful to know that the gastrolounge is on the second story - not street level. This confused us at first when we were looking for it. When you get there, order some drinks as the wait will still be a few more minutes. Their original cocktails are both unique and fantastic.  Finally, the food! Since it's tapas-style you'll want to order several dishes per person. The server was incredibly helpful to recommend dishes that were perfectly paired and balanced so that we didn't order too many heavy items or too many light dishes. The highlight was the dragon sushi and the berry-cupcake with red-wine cream frosting. We also had flatbreads, fried goat-cheese bruschetta, and Asian-glazed pork-with-watermelon tacos. It was out of this world delicious! My partner also ordered the skewers with chimichanga and enjoyed them, but I thought they were just a bit too fatty and chewy.   All-in-all we had a great time here. The servers were knowledgeable, the staff was friendly and attentive, the ambiance was relaxed Southern hipster-chic. We would most definitely return here!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this little spot , and I enjoyed myself. This visit I had cocktails and sushi and it was quite tasty. The ambiance is everything, small, quaint , a sense of exclusivity. The drink and food menu is a little pricy so if I had to choose, I'd choose the drinks. However, know that if all you're going to do is drink, you have to sit at the bar. This is definitely a great spot for a date , or a classy night out with friends."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place in Charlotte! Everything we have tried on the menu has been great and the waiters are all very friendly and helpful. Our go to's are the tuna tacos and the dynamite and red dragon rolls. Their daily specials and cocktails are always special and delish.   The first time we went on a Saturday and waited more than 2 hours but we learned a trick that if you go right after work during the week you won't have to wait at all. It might be worth waiting on your first visit but after that you just want to be able to get seated right away. If you do wait, the place downstairs (twenty two) always has great exhibitions and reasonable drinks.   Although we are young, we are not typically into the hipster scene but this place is really a great environment for all."}
{"text":"Great food. Cupcakes are to die for! Portions and prices just right. I also appreciated the fact that my drink actually seemed to have alcohol in it. So many places jip you on the alcohol but Sol did not. We'll be back !"}
{"text":"Cute little spot! Crowded, but didn't take long to be seated.  We sat in the little area with the sofas; very relaxed atmosphere.  Great sushi - had the Queen Charlotte Roll and it didn't disappoint.  Also tried the Southern Fried Wings and the Mini Burgers.  Everything was great and the service was as well.  Definitely will add this to my list of spots to frequent in the Queen City!"}
{"text":"Obsessed and can't wait to go back.  Fried goat cheese bruschetta - amazing  Sliders with blue cheese and onion strings- how can you go wrong? Southern Nachos (not on their online menu) - instead of chips it's served with thinly sliced, fried chicken.  I don't remember what else was on them because we ate them so fast.  Grilled cheese -  yum Steak kabobs with chimi churi - just ok, I wouldn't order again.  The steak was too well done.  Plan to wait and don't go with a group of more than 6 or you may wait until midnight.    When I go back I'm going to have a hard time ordering....I want to try everything!    P.S. Although the menu has a a lot of unique items even the pickiest of eaters will find something,"}
{"text":"Cool joint. Great atmosphere. A little cramped when it came to seating because it is smaller on the inside. But, don't let that hold you back. They do Tapas plates, so be prepared for small plates. They suggest you order several and I agree. Overall good experience. The food was very good, but not great."}
{"text":"Take the stairs on the outside of the building to the hopping gastro pub on the second floor. Sushi, small plates, some southern-inspired dishes, everything freshly made in the kitchen that you can see if you look across the bar. This place is busy any night of the week, which is usually a good thing. The food has some great flavors, but the portion size is a little small for what you pay for. I got the pork belly tacos, for which they are known. You get 6 1\" cubes of pork belly with the same size and amount of pickled watermelon on two small tortillas.  The cocktails are also tasty, some of which are batch-made and are thus on-tap. They have some interesting twists on classic combinations, using bitters and cordials for for extra punches of flavor."}
{"text":"Interesting!  Came back finally for New Years Eve party. Different feel this time, because of the music was catered to the event. All in all, definitely a place worth visiting!  The servers were nice and attentive. One bartender was able to catch a bottle of amaretto with one hand, without it hitting the ground. Good reflex!  Was not able to try the food, again this time -- boo! We seem to come at the wrong time. So hint! It will take a while to get your food after 10pm. So come early!   Will update more, with food in my belly from this place!"}
{"text":"Super friendly bar staff and fun neighborhood lounge. Definitely more a spot for cocktails - very limited beer and wine offerings. But if craft cocktails are your thing look no further. Small menu of bar food with some great selections (couple sushi selections, skewers of assorted meats/fish) - and some not so healthy options (various fried foods). Thought the skewers were an especially great option for small bites while enjoying the great drinks. A note of personal thanks to the staff for safe keeping my credit card that I accidentally left behind - was relieved to retrieve it there the next day!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat and enjoy the urban scene. Great music, djs, and great dishes. A very eclectic menu and seasonal variations that keep you intrigued! No complaints."}
{"text":"Food was incredible but the music was waaaaaayyyyyyy too loud.  The DJ was playing techno as loud as it would go. People were leaving because it was too loud. The waitress even told him to turn it down 5 times but he wouldn't. Impossible to talk to each other or enjoy the food.  Really too bad because I won't go back though the food was the best in charlotte."}
{"text":"The food is great, but their big ticket item is the cocktails. I can not find a better Old Fashion anywhere else in Charlotte. They have so many more drinks to boot. It's definitely worth checking out. It is one of the highlights of Plaza Midwood."}
{"text":"I said before that they fry everything in the south. Well so far everything I've tried has been good so I wasn't complaining. Ok it gets better... this is phenomenal. Fried Brussel sprouts & Rocky Mountain Oysters (veal). Thank you Soul Gastrolounge!"}
{"text":"A fairly interesting joint with a good beer selection and wide range of food items, with my favorite being the eel roll! Wasn't too keen on the Korean wings though as the sauce was too rich and overwhelming. Sashimi was surprisingly fresh."}
{"text":"Soul!  Love the cozy beatnik-meets-diva decor.  I have been here a few times over the years but didnt try the sushi until last night.  I had the Soul Roll (Warning!!!  A little spicy!!!!) and my friend had the Queen Roll (tempura whatever how can you go wrong?)  The food came out on separate plates which is different, usually if there are just two rolls ordered they would put it on one.  But it was faster this way and we were able to dive right in!  We sat at the table by the door and when our tiny table got too full of stuff the waitress neatly opened the drawer on the vintage table and promptly lined up the soy sauce and extra things on the table in the drawer - hilarious! And genius!  The rolls were about $10 a piece...very reasonable.    The lamb lollipops are also a favorite with the spanakopita - if you want to get several small plates to share.  Cant wait to be back Soul!  :-D"}
{"text":"Nice food n atmosphere. Great service, hip crowd n ambiance. Had to wait a bit to get seated but it was worth it. Food had distinct flavors although the quantity/price ratio sucks. Moscow Mules were perfect. All in all a must visit joint."}
{"text":"Over priced and overly loud.  Ok food but epic snarky hipster douche-baggery wait staff and crowd."}
{"text":"This place has all the character in the world, we dined here a while back and our \"table\" consisted of arm chairs and a quaint little table. The food is so on point and the \"tapas\" style provides you with enough wiggle room to try as many items as you desire! Service was a little off, received an \"I don't want to be here vibe from the waitress\", but other than that quite the experience."}
{"text":"You get a 4 star. This is a good place to have a basic salty dinner and cocktails. I mean, it feels good but I'm not sure what else is exceptional here. Mule on tap, do you even know what that means? No time for bartenders to make my drink."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the hype is about this place. Husband and I went in last night to have some dinner and drinks while in town and the wait was an hour and 45 minutes. With all the great reviews they got we decided to have some drinks and wait it out. When we finally were seated, we ordered a few of the plates and needless to say the wait was not worth it. The only thing we both really enjoyed was the pan con tomate....we ordered the Ramen hoping it would taste exceptional and my husband said it tasted like a Ramen concoction he's mad himself in the past. I'm giving it 3 stars because the staff was friendly, the winter mule was delicious and the food came out pretty darn fast but we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Hip. Loud. Good but inconsistent food. Drinks were pricey."}
{"text":"I love this place. Seriously love this place. Which can be a little dangerous when you live 3 blocks away.  The ambiance is groovy in a refreshingly alternative way and could easily be at home in San Francisco. The music is usually really good, but can be a bit loud at times making conversation difficult. Still, a respectable first funky date location if I do say so myself.  On to the food, there are a few must haves: the truffle fries and the pork belly tacos. The fries go without saying on account of the truffle, while the pork belly tacos consist of simple ingredients that I would never expect to have worked together: tortilla, 3 cubes of fatty pork belly, an Asian glaze, and watermelon. Yes, watermelon. At $9 for two small tacos I could rightfully call it highway robbery. But you'll be paying for seconds and thirds (as I have been known to do) when these flavors combine to elicit tears of ecstasy as you fall to your quivering knees in a euphoric culinary-induced coma. I may have to clear my schedule tonight.  Honestly, I've never really had anything bad here--although I can say that the bone marrow challenged me a little. All aside, there is a reason that there is often 2 hour+ waits to get inside for dinner. They are amazing.   TIP: If there is a huge line, try stalking the patrons in bar stools until you can swoop in. I reduced my 2 hour wait to 5 minutes this way."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place! Amazing, creative food, intimate atmosphere, and servers are crazy attentive! Diverse menu with everything from Asian Pork Belly Tacos and creative sushi, to pork stuffed Mac n cheese, lamb lollypops, meat skewers, and the incredible cupcake of the day! Omg. I have to get back here ASAP! It's worth the 2 hour ride from Greenville."}
{"text":"If you are a Tapas fan like we are this is a must. I love that they have sushi as well as Greek inspired tapas along with other types of tapas cuisine. You have to get the pork belly watermelon it will be the best thing you ever put into your mouth. They are on the App no wait  so it makes the waiting in line soooo much easier.  Its a great date night."}
{"text":"Best food I've had in Charlotte so far.  Creative, imaginative menu....mouth watering!!"}
{"text":"As visitors to Charlotte, we knew we wanted to eat somewhere exciting so we turned to Yelp for suggestions.  The #1 option was Soul Gastrolounge and I'm so excited we decided on this place!  I wasn't craving a huge meal and love tapas so I thought this place had the right set up for us.  The vibe is very cool, hangout with your friends while you drink and snack.  Kind of hipster but not over the top.  We chose to sit at the bar which was fun to kind of people watch and really take in the place, but they also have tables and couch/chair areas you can sit at also.  It is located in a area with a few other busy restaurants so you may have to park elsewhere and walk over.   We chose the gyro skewers, french fries and the special that night which was a smoked cod on a potato cake.  The skewers were great and the sauce was a nice compliment with its cool/fresh taste.  The fries were to die for and I had to tell my husband to stop hogging them all.  I didn't try the special, but my husband was a fan.  Overall everything we tried was great!  They bring out your table's item whenever they ready so it wasn't so much a \"ok now we can eat our meal\" situation.  The food is a little on the expensive side (which I've learned is kind of standard at tapas places) so this would be more ideal for a special occasion (date night, night out with friends, etc) rather than a regular night.  I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for something delicious with a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love Love Love. Wonderful tapas and small plates. Perfect for a social dinner with drinks. The Deep South Nachos are an absolute must!"}
{"text":"I wanted to come here for a while. Glad I did as I enjoyed the food. The place was rather small and the seating arrangements were kinda awkward.  I understand the \"lounge\" title in the name now, but  I wasn't in the mood to converse with any one new that would have been seated inches on either side of me.  Charlotte peeps aren't into meeting strangers this way I find (I grew up in New Orleans where meeting new people while dining is the norm). We enjoyed sitting at the counter near the DJ.  Music was ok, but typical house music gets old quick. Variety is the spice of life - kinda like their menu.   The mixed dips where rather dull though (baba ganoush, humus, tziki) and were served with stale, I mean toasted, pita chips. Asked for warm pita which satisfied me and was worth the extra $1.  My wife had the steak skewer and she didn't likey.  We enjoyed their french fries very much. My highlight was their sushi. I loved the Soul Roll and their hamachi sashimi dish. Great presentation and fresh tasting. I'll try more sushi next time.  I'll be back but not in a huge, crazy, tremendous hurry."}
{"text":"My friends invited me here and I was so confused by the name. It makes me think of Gastro intestinal issues. Anywhoo...once I got over that it wasn't so bad. I feel that they are a bit over priced but at least the food is good. We all had sushi. I was looking forward to dessert. Our waiter talked up this \"lemon vanilla ice-cream\" so we ordered it but she came back to with a sad face to tell us that they had run out. I'm not gonna lie, my heart was a little bit broken. I still want to try it so I guess I have to go back.  I liked the atmosphere, its kind of hipster/trendy...great place for small plates and delicious drinks."}
{"text":"Plza can easily be one of my favorite places in Charlotte aside from now southend. The food and libations are creative and consistently pushing the culinary reform here in CLT. I wish they would open another bigger location. The music is always great, vibe is great...the wait to sit down because it's so small and it's first come , first serve, not so much. If you are a late diner, great! The later in the evening it gets, your chances of scoring a table is good and the music gets better (either the DJ has had a few or I have, still trying to figure that out)!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled across this place and are definitely  going back. We only grabbed a drink and dessert, but the vibe and the food looked amazing. Really cool hole-in-the-wall."}
{"text":"This is among my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. The Queen Charlotte roll is my personal favourite. It does get extremely crowded at nights so If you're at the bar, ask for Stephanie. She is a solid bar tender who will make you smashing special cocktails that aren't on the menu. Enjoy.   But be prepared to buy more than 3 tapas per person or you will spend a lot and leave hungry."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with a really exciting menu, delicious food and a great bar staff, can't go wrong, been in the business 20 years and I was extremely satisfied"}
{"text":"Holy mother of Noms.   I had gone to meet Michael G's sister (Lauren G) for dinner in the historic neighborhood of Plaza Midwood.   It's quite a hard place to find, as it's on the second floor of an old building.   For starters we had got the , Goat Cheese bruschetta, and some preposterous Sushi Tempura.   Non sequitur... I don't usually say these kind of things, but Soul is one of the best restaurants I've ever eaten in my life.  I mean there was a party in my mouth.  Ok..back to the food.  Round 2.  Lamb lollipops inappropriately named (in a good way), cuz we ate them in one chomp.  Pork Belly Tacos...Let me tell you, that pig lived a good life.  So tender.   To top it off for dessert, we had the Vietnamese Coffee ice cream.  Overall one of the best culinary experiences EVER."}
{"text":"This has been and continues to be one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte.  The incredible amount of options available is enough to visit Soul but the fact that each is prepared to perfection every single time takes this place to the next level.  It would be an incredible sushi restaurant if that's all they served! But they have some incredible small plate options (lamb lollipops...) along with great sides and desserts.  The cocktail menu is excellent as well."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks, awesome vibe, good place to take friends from out of town. Pork belly tacos and the peanut butter cupcake are the best thing I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Can't say much that has not been said. So, I'll make this easy.   1) Very hip place-make sure you look jazzy!  2) Expect to wait. Very small...think like 15 tables max and then the bar area.  2) Goat cheese balls are the BEST!  4) Oh, its kinda hard to find...it's upstairs, sign is on the corner of the building,  5) Parking is a nightmare.  6) It's not cheap, but worth it."}
{"text":"Found this place on a site saying it was a top 25 place to eat in Charlotte so I went.  It is located upstairs in a building and has a very trendy atmosphere.   I took my family and ordered so many things off the menu!  Our waitress was fun and friendly and helped recommend things for us to order. My favorite by far were the Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos.  I don't even like watermelon but the pork with it was truly amazing! My only complaint is the order comes with two small tacos so a bit pricey for what you get. The French Fries With Garlic-herb Salt, Pecorino & Truffle Oilwere truly something to behold I honestly have never had fries like them!  The Korean Bbq wings had great flavor sweet with a good amount of spice to them.  The Fried Brussel Sprouts also had good flavor and were worth ordering. The only bad thing I had was the Dirty South Nachos are basically fried crust in a sauce and they were basically nasty!  So all in all this place is worth going great food even if it is a little pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"I've heard so many people in Charlotte rave about this place and after checking it out last night - I now see why. The size of the space makes it feel cozy- both perfect for a date night or an evening with friends the small plates make for wonderful sharing experience.   The Greek salad is the best I have ever had. No lettuce but stuffed with marinated veggies and a healthy block of feta right on top. The pork belly tacos are an absolute staple - big chunks of pork belly with a square of juicy watermelon creates an amazing flavor combination. We also tried the shells and cheese. Wow. Again the flavors were insane...goey melted cheese with a crispy top layer over three shells stuffed with BBQ pork belly. The last thing that really sticks out were the fried goat cheese on bruschetta - an amazing ball of fried goat cheese on top of perfectly seasoned bruschetta and a crispy baguette.   Even on a Monday this place was packed so make sure to do the Yelp check in feature to lock down a table."}
{"text":"I never tire of this place! Really great atmosphere (even though it tends to get loud sometimes), food never disappoints and the specialty cocktails are great! On the first weekend of the month, they have Drag Queen brunch...haven't been yet but trying it next month and I can't wait! Love, Love, Love you Soul Gastrolounge! Don't ever change :)"}
{"text":"Hipster restaurant / bar that serves great food in a cozy, warehouse type space with a DJ spinning tunes. We ordered spanakopita, saganaki, tzatziki, and chimichurri beef skewers. Food and service was excellent, but the hostess was so rude I would hesitate to go back. I understand that this place is hip and super popular right now, to the point where you're constantly busy with waits for tables over 2 hours. This does not mean that you don't have to be welcoming to your guests and can expect people to keep coming back for more regardless of how they're greeted when entering your restaurant. I'm not very familiar with Charlotte, but there seem to be many options available for dining and drinking, so I don't think you can afford to have someone working the hostess stand to be that rude to your guests. Wow."}
{"text":"I'm a foodie and I am a firm believer that home cooked food is still the best. With that being said, this is one of the best meals I've had in a really long time. Ever tapa dish I had was absolutely delectable with unique flavors, garnishes, presentation. Most importantly all of the meats were cooked at the right temperature!  I would recommend everything I had  1. Fried Brussel Sprouts (lick the sauce off the plate good) 2. Pork Belly Tacos (I think I shed a tear because of how the flavors come together and melts in your mouth) 3. Roasted Duck w/ rice grits (Grits that will change your life) 4. Lamb Skewers (cooked perfectly and every bite was seasoned to perfection)  5. Smash and Grab Cocktail - refreshing drink with Bourbon and Basil   My only knock on the spot is the high price of the drinks/cocktails. After ordering a few rounds, I wasn't expecting a phone bill.   The wait can be a little long so get there early and get your reservations in.  I wild definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone that comes to Charlotte."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot in Charlotte!! LOVE IT! Great food, great atmosphere. My husband and I love to go and sit at the bar and eat there. $6 champagne- in a cool glass- can't beat it! Get the pork belly tacos, you won't be sorry. Also love the lamb/gyro kabobs. I love it all!"}
{"text":"Ordered the house special sushi dish. Loved it despite the excess cream cheese! They had spicy tuna sashimi in the middle that was also awesome! Ordered the spiced rum, it really warmed me up on the cold winter day. The open brick walls and wood beam ceilings and bar made for a cozy hangout!"}
{"text":"Came here spontaneously with my little sissy. There was a wait around 6-7 so we sat at the bar as soon as a couple got up. Hop on the bar stool, ordered my sparkling wine with the trio dip, pork belly tacos and soul roll. MMmm, spectaculish!! Plates were well presented and food made me wanting more!   Btw, I could probably finish all of that all by myself! Just too bad that I had to share :("}
{"text":"The minute I walked in I was on sensory overload!  I'm gonna get this out of the way....the food....one word....stupendous! My favorite thus far, the lamb lollipops....nom...nom...nom.  Ok, now the more interesting details.  First off, the joint is small...really small and the layout is much like a galley kitchen, you know straight and fairly narrow.  So one side of the place = bar, the other = dinner seating.  Easy peasy.   There was a DJ there when I went so I'm assuming that is the norm.  Strange collection of music the night I was there but it was so loud didn't really matter.  And crowded it was, a little over an hour wait even at 7:45pm.  Keep that in mind and get there early to obtain solid bar real estate while you wait.  The decor is trendy chic and seriously had me pondering for over 30-45 minutes trying to figure out...\"Am I at a bar or a restaurant?\" Hahaha....didn't matter really the spot was fun, full of energy and the food was more than worth the wait :)  My only suggestion would be go during the week when it's not packed, I think I would have enjoyed it even more."}
{"text":"Perfect date night restaurant. Best Damn food and drinks in town. Small bites enough to share and have a taste. Definitely recommend the Cheese and Shell with sweet pork. Go try it out!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a little gem. The food is unique and fun. It's a super eclectic mix of cultures and flavors. It's pretty small and seating is limited, they don't take reservations so there is always a wait!!! Not bad when there's two or four of you but If 6 girls show up for a birthday dinner you might be waiting for-eva!  They are on the no-wait app so that helps a little. I highly recommend you get on that before you arrive to help move you along.   So once/if you get a seat (possibly a 2 hour wait) they have such great small plates!!! Well they only have small plates.  Spanakopita  Tuna tacos  Best grilled Caesar salad I've EVER had Hamachi with jalape√±o  Queen Charlotte roll Mushroom on toast Avocado stack  Are a few of my favorites. I don't eat lamb but a friend raved over the lamb lollipops. And another girl enjoyed the watermelon and pork belly taco.   Stay away from the Rocky Mountain oysters. There are no oysters in the mountains so that my friend will be an order of sheep, maybe goat balls! Can you say gross. I don't care how good someone says they are, those things aren't coming close to my mouth!   I love this place. It's a fun loud artsy atmosphere, all the staff is super casual and a little hippy. Lots of tattoos and patchouli.  It's great. Just go on a night that's not a 2 hour wait, or plan for it so you aren't starving as you stand and sip on their delicious cocktails"}
{"text":"This. Place. Is. Awesome. For a couple on date night would say 3-4 tapas would be enough to share depending on your appetite (it was my bday so we did 3 tapas a sushi roll and dessert).  If your doing tapas no doubt go with the Pork Belly Tacos. Pro tip, cut the tortilla into thirds and eat each bit as a mini taco.  The saganaki was awesome and the red dragon sushi roll was absolutely on point but I will say left thinking that it didn't matter what I ordered beverything on the menu would be good.   2¬¢- don't do what I did and wait four years to finally try this place!"}
{"text":"I came to Soul on a Wednesday night and luckily we got there early (around 6:30pm) and only had to wait 20 minutes or so (for two people). This place is extremely popular so get there early or expect a long wait! The food is definitely worth the wait. We tried the shells with pork belly and a sushi roll and both were incredible. I can't wait to go back and try more things on the menu. This place is also not outrageously expensive and even the drinks are reasonably priced unless you order the fancy cocktails. This is my favorite restaurant so far in Charlotte."}
{"text":"You can NEVER go wrong with soul, the only thing I dislike the most about souls is the awful wait time. I swear you can wait up to an hour and a half getting there at 6pm just a little after they open. But they are that good and worth the wait TRUST ME!!! And if you go with friends my suggestion would be for everyone one to order two or three things they want to try so everyone can taste.   DON'T BE STINGY!!!  Enjoy your dinner and night cap at SOUL!"}
{"text":"Great place. The flatbread was amazing, the Korean BBQ wings were good. Keep in mind it's tapas so get several to share with the table. Loved the set up of this restaurant, nice hipster vibe. Will go back, will recommend. Definitley a great date spot."}
{"text":"The wait is crazy so use the No Wait app to get in line without being there. But the food is AMAZING! must get the pork tacos"}
{"text":"I'm claustrophobic and loud music bugs me. Yet I'm still willing to give Soul 5 stars because it's just that good.   I've been here several times and have not yet gotten past my menu indecisiveness. At other restaurants, I will narrow it down to 2, maybe 3 things, and then just go on gut instinct when the server arrives. However, at a recent dinner with a friend, we both found ourselves flipping pages back and forth, almost unable to make up our minds. (Indecisiveness loves company, it would seem.)  Though I tried to resist the temptation, I ended up going with my usual, the Mini Burgers. Holy pickle on a stick, that is a good burger. I also got a Spider Roll, and at the last minute, I threw on an order of eel Nigiri, just in case. My server double checked to make sure I was hungry enough for all that food, and indeed, I was.   All of the food was, as always, spectacular, but I have never seen such slices of eel in all my life. They were like salmon filets, they were so big, and the minuscule seaweed strip couldn't even hold them onto their tiny rice beds. As soon as they arrived I understood my servers skepticism. Still, I found room.   My friend enjoyed his falafel pita immensely, and we made good on the trio of spreads.  His cupcake (the night's special, Kahlua cake with Bailey's icing and chocolate chips) was divine, though I was a little full to steal as much of it as I could have.  Oh how I wish the space were bigger, but Spring will soon be here and the patio will add more seating. And while loud DJ tunes may not be best for 2 friends who haven't talked in awhile, it did make it easier for us to talk about the people next to us without them getting suspicious. Yep, I'm sticking with my 5 stars, and I'll be back again, music and all."}
{"text":"My friends & I spent the evening out at Common Market South End when we realized none of us have eaten dinner yet! Being only a week into my relocation to Charlotte, my native friends took me out for a treat: Soul Gastrolounge.  It was about 10:30 at night, and the place was packed. We were originally told that the wait would be about 40 minutes. Ugh! About five minutes later, the hostess came back and explained that if we'd like to 'lounge,' the three of us could sit down right away. Sign us up! We were greeted by a selection of comfy chairs and a small coffee table. The setting was intimate, not too loud, and yet plenty of opportunities for people watching. I absolutely loved the eclectic decor, exposed brick, and dim lighting. With waters all around, we made our game plan by ordering four tapas: ahi tuna tacos, the dip trio, scallops, and fig arugula flatbread. Oh my lord. Not kidding when I say these were to die for! I think my favorite was the ahi tuna tacos; quite possibly the perfect mix of sushi meets mexican. The best taco shell I've ever had. Light, crunchy, melt-in-your-mouth goodness. I'd be happy to go into detail about all of the dishes we had, but I'm afraid we'd be here all night.  The service was great. Very accomodating. Our drinks were always filled, and she even brought us more pita chips (3 times, mind you!) for our dips. And at the end of the night, pricing wasn't too bad. Four tapas, three friends, $13 each + tip. Not too shabby. I'll definitely will be back. Great place to take friends, and this new Charlottean is hooked!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. Came in on a week night following the holiday season it's on the corner and upstairs. They have limited seating. I didn't take many pictures, but the food is exotic and good. The lamb was nice and tender loved the sliders they had a spicy sauce on them and the spiced drink I had really warmed me up. The lemon ice cub gave it a zing. The staff were attentive and friendly. I suggest making a reservation in advance or you may be left standing. There was a large crowd that accumulated as we dinned. The food came out quick when you order despite the crowd. Overall I recommend and will return to try more of there tapas."}
{"text":"My gf and I are straight up food snobs, I would not dole out high praise to a place I was not truly impressed with. I'm giving Soul Gastrolounge 5 stars for their variety of creative, tasty cocktails and the fact that some of the small plates were literally among the best things I've ever eaten (looking at you, pork belly taco). Plus, maybe it's because I'm from New York, but I found the prices to be more than reasonable."}
{"text":"Everything here was.... the best i EVER had.  Sticky veal short ribs Lamb lollipops (are you kidding me???) Sashimi tuna tacos Bone Marrow Saganaki  Very cool oldschool looking spot, dj and/or live music depending on the day. Big cozy booths.... makes me wish i lived in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Hayley was awesome..drinks tasty and very attentive staff.   Recommend the cucumber mule and pork belly."}
{"text":"PORK BELLY TACOS. Amazing! You have to get them - probably my favorite food in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Wow. And wow. On a work visit, this was recommended by Jonathan at the Omni, spot on! A quick cab ride away from the downtown area. Brian and Kelly our bartenders super meticulous about their craft. Cucumber mule awesome fresh. They will make you your fav, but this is the one time it was better to go with their specialties..ps..no sour mix in their drinks, its a sin, I agree.. Both pork and tuna tacos amazing..pan con tomate..wow..even spanakopita full of flavor. Save room for chocolate bread pudding and banana chocolate in phyllo. Every staff member so welcoming and the DJ nice funky touch...you sit, chill, he spins, we drink, we munch...it blew any NJ small plates away by far. Thx guys! Might do a repeat tomorrow...why dismiss a good thing!"}
{"text":"Had pretty high expectations of the place after some friends raved about it. I honestly thought it was just okay. Sure some of the tapas were inventive and good, but I've had much better. I'm also not crazy about the setting. The place doesn't seem to have found the right mix between bar and restaurant and we were sitting in what seemed like a bar lounge area and served tapas. It just didn't really feel right and it was a bit cramped with our big group. Still, worth a try and there are some good choices on the menu."}
{"text":"Yes, you are going to have to wait to eat here. Yes, it is going to be worth the wait. The tapas are awesome. Specifically, check out the pork belly and watermelon tacos."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with two friends because I saw decent reviews. It's location is in a pretty hipsterish area in Charlotte--but not the NoDa kind of hipster lol. I called for a reservation and they said they didn't take reservations so we just went but when we got there we had to have the entire party for them to seat us--understandable. I honestly wanted to sit inside but they said they don't seat parties of 3's in booths and that there was a party of 10 taking up all of the  3-seaters. I asked if we could sit at the perfectly open seats in the back but the host said those are strictly for two people, even though ten seats were literally wide open...didn't really understand their logic but just went with it. The host was kind of rude though to be honest, in a passive way.  When we were finally seated we actually sat outside, but it was a nice view and the weather was nice so we didn't mind. We ordered two orders of pork belly tacos with watermelon salsa, the surf and turf special, and curried lamb at first. It took a good 20-ish minute wait for our food to come out, and I was a bit surprised actually at the portion sizes. They were so small. Especially for the price ($12~$18 range). There were only two pork belly tacos on a plate, so essentially we were paying $6 per taco. I won't complain about the taste though--it was delectable! But because the portions were so small, we ended up ordering southern style and Korean style wings as well, and to no surprise, there were only like 5-6 wings. The wings weren't anything special, and the Korean style wings were too burnt because they used gochujang (red pepper paste), which burns easily. To wrap up, we ordered two cocktails which were crazily overpriced..they were seriously the same price as the food (at least $12). I don't think I'd go drinking there again.  Overall, the atmosphere and food is great, but they could step up their game with service and pricing and/or portion sizes. I might go there on a pay day or something if I want to be a bit more fancy, but I don't find myself coming here often."}
{"text":"From the name I would not expect the place to have an asian fusion vibe to it but one glance at the Yelp pictures and that's what it is!  I just happened to be there earlier and there was already a line at the door before it opened!  Definitely is a good sign.    It is a pretty small space with dark lighting and definitely a hipster vibe.  I snagged a seat at the bar.  The waiter told me the Pork Belly tacos were the most popular so I had to order that and I also got the Veal Short Ribs.  The pork belly tacos I thought was just ok, I did love the watermelon salsa on top but the pork belly itself was a bit tougher.  The veal short ribs though, sooo tender and had so much flavor.  It definitely made up for the tacos!  I wish I had more room to try things.    The ambiance of the place and the ribs definitely made it a nice appetizer stop for me.  Wish I had room for a drink since their drink menu looked phenomenal and interesting."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!! Loved every dish we tried especially the hamachi with the jalape√±o dipping sauce. The bone marrow was soooo good also the beef skewer with chimichurri is delicious!! This place nailed it with every dish we tried. Highly recommend it if you like small plates."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday one year. It was just my husband and I. This place is always busy! There's always a wait. I think the food was tasty but nothing memorable that really stood out to me. Maybe we should give it another go. The parking situation isn't really the greatest either. The place is quite small. I think the concept would work a lot better in a place that was just a smidgen bigger with more seating."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service! The cucumber mules were so good we could have sat around all evening and drank them. Chicken skin nachos were EPIC!!"}
{"text":"Soul is always crowded. For good reason. But I have avoided Soul because of that. I do not however, avoid this fine place. Recently I have gone to Soul for food before concerts at Midwood Guitars. The early crowd is not so bad. The service is always great early. But tonight I hit it at prime big crowd time. I hovered at the first come bar for a while. I ordered wine (Chardonnay not so great) and told the bartender I really wanted to just get a stool and order dinner. Next thing I knew he spotted a couple who was about to leave and he asked them to make sure they gave a seat to me. Way cool. So my take = service is great whenever you come. Just be patient. Oh and BTW when I started enjoying my sushi the sushi chef looked over at me. We made eye contact and I gave her the thumbs up."}
{"text":"Located in my favorite part of Charlotte, NoDa, the line at this restaurant is consistently outrageous. Unfortunately, you can't reserve a table in advance, but whatever you do, I beg you to stay put. Order a drink from the bar while you wait on the terrace, where there's a beautiful view of the Charlotte skyline. The food, drinks, and overall atmosphere are incredible. Like many people on here, the pork belly tacos are to die for...in fact, you're guaranteed to experience a foodgasm. Whether you're here with friends, on a date, or even solo, you're bound to fall in love."}
{"text":"As a bar = good.  As a restaurant = not so good.  This review is based on my \"dining\" experience... Love that this place opened in the neighborhood, but based on my experience, I will only go for drinks from now on.   Yes - it is very cool inside, and love the balcony looking over the city.  The menu looks great on paper but the execution and service needs to have some kinks worked out.  Hoping it is just the newness factor.   The staff kept bringing us the wrong table's food.  Most times we knew it - except the one time.... We ordered \"spicy tuna\" rolls - It looked like a mess when it came out (like I would have rolled it.) but had some avocado and extras in it.... After my date and I finished it, the waiter brought out the \"spicy tuna rolls\" and we realized we just finished the people next to us rolls.  The other stuff we ordered (grilled cheese panini, fries) tasted good - but how could you screw that up?  You can tell that the waitress was working hard and was still friendly to us, but it just seems like there was some execution issues going on.  Hope they get things worked out."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere, don't get me wrong.  The food is 3/5 stars (the fried stuff is on the greasy side).  Unfortunately I've given up trying to get into Soul after being quoted a one hour wait at 8:00 on a Wednesday in September."}
{"text":"Why don't more people hang out here? I'm yelping as I'm sitting by the DJ booth. Love the vibe, the music, but I wish at least few folks would groove on the \"dance floor\". This is a really good soul spot if you just want to do a couple of two steps and do a few spins. I will for sure be back."}
{"text":"First-rate, interesting food! We ate at the Soul Gastrolounge on a Sunday night -- we were lucky to get seated quickly, as this otherwise admirable place doesn't accept reservations -- and had a fine meal.  Nothing was bad, and several of the dished were truely outstanding.  We did five small plate/tapas and had a comfortable amount of food for two.  The top item we had was a shrimp cheviche made with coconut milk. It was sweet, of all things, with a touch of heat and was remarkable in a very good way.  The Salmon-O-Pitas were also wponderful (though I would have liked more a of a salmon flavor).  Likewise the goat cheese flatbreads. Definietly worth a return visit -- if only we could."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite restaurants ever. It's a shame they don't have one in Atlanta! Great vibe, live DJ spins hip, chill mixes of fresh beats and slow jams. The bar was great and bartender made me a really unique cocktail after hearing that I'm a fan of Deaths Door. He used DD Gin, St.  Germaine, celery bitters, lemon and cracked black pepper garnish. It wasn't my kind of drink but I really loved it! Very inventive and flavorful. The food was excellent. Sushi that was super fresh, awesome ponzu. The pork belly watermelon tacos were stupid delicious and I tried Foie Gras for the first time. It was very buttery and extremely fatty but I enjoyed the tapas portion on a flakey mini roll. The avocado stack was my favorite. Elements of guacamole were present but it was a sliced avocado with minimal extras a super flavorful thin citrus dressing. Our table of 6 ordered an obscene amount of small plates and I cannot remember everything we ordered but I can say absolutely everything was amazing. Inventive, fresh, creative, executed well-- the wait staff and bartender were all super cool and chill. Not overly expensive and accommodating. What's not to love about this place?"}
{"text":"Fabulous bar. Great cocktails, food and music. Shane at the bar was amazing. Try the Black Lace cocktail!"}
{"text":"I went to soul gastrolounge on a ladies night out. The wait was long but we finally got seated. The two of us each had a cocktail. I had the rosemary gin cocktail which was ver good. Others were less impressed. For dinner we shared the ceviche, flatbread, and Brussel Sprouts. The Brussel sprouts were amazing! The ceviche was bland and lacking something special. The rest was ok but for the price and all the hype I wasn't that impressed. Maybe we got the wrong things... I will try again however because it has a cool, fun atmosphere and there are plenty of other things to try."}
{"text":"Soul is one of the very few places in Charlotte at which I'll wait 2 hours for a table.  The food and experience is just that good (plus you can kill time by getting a drink downstairs -- they'll text you when your table is ready).  In my opinion, sharing small plates is the best format for a dinner.  Favorites on the menu include Asian-glazed pork belly tacos; all the sushi; braised veal cheek ramen in garlic cream sauce."}
{"text":"I went to Soul on a Friday night for dinner. Had heard many good things and was excited to try it out! The wait for a table inside was 90 minutes but for a table on their balcony we were seated immediately (it was hot out!).   I ordered their version of a Pisco sour to start. It was okay but probably not worth the $12 price tag. We ordered the white bean hummus dip, smoked salmon spanakopita and the bone marrow which were all fine but nothing to write home about. The pork belly and pickled watermelon tacos, however, were phenomenal. We would go back for those tacos alone.  The dessert menu was surprisingly limited for a gastrolounge -- kept only to cupcakes and ice cream -- so we passed.  All in all, we had a nice evening at Soul but don't think it lived up to the hype."}
{"text":"So, the BEST was the DJ and the food! KUDOS to the DJ and the Chefs!!! For sure, the DJ was ON POINT with his entire set; not one foul song!! Obviously, I can't stop talking about him; he was rockin it (and on a TUESDAY)!!!! The food was delicious! I had sushi and it was ON POINT!!!   The only thing I didn't like was that we asked for a booth but was told booths were for larger parties as was a table in the corner, however, we were allowed to sit in the corner table! That was NO BUENO! Any paying patron should have the option to sit where they want to sit especially if the seating is available - to tell someone that they can't sit anywhere, almost put me in a mind set that there was an underlying reason behind that. It was a Tuesday night....surely they weren't expecting a huge crowd, but I digress.   Altogether, if the seating situation had been better, I would have rated it a 5. For the DJ and bomb food I give it 4 stars and will be back for those two reasons!!!  Revised:  I went there a second time and again the manager seemed nonchalant towards myself and my companion plus I noticed the same type of attitude towards another African American patron; for this reason I changed my rating to below par. If I did not feel such a prejudice undertone it would be much better but because of this reason I will not ever return to this establishment even if the DJ was one of the best I've ever heard...He's not there all the time anyway."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant on Earth. I would want my last meal to be pork belly tacos from Soul.... We eat here for every special occasion. There isn't really anything on the menu that isn't amazing. The brunch is fantastic! The bloody Marys and mimosas are awesome as well."}
{"text":"This restaurant got the most tastiest food ever since I've been in Charlotte. The food is so unique. I just can't explain how delicious it is. I highly recommend anyone to try their food. The alcohol is a bit pricey though.   The DJ is very talented! He plays very good beats. Our waitress Collette she is very friendly too. I like her style as a waitress with dreads and cool nail designs.Much better than the uptight all black dress code. This place is very comfortable.   It just makes you feel like you are home."}
{"text":"This palce is really neat down the street from my work and never get the chance ot stop in and eat there since they are only open at dinner time.    However ate there with a my friend Kevin and we sat outside on their balcony watching the cars go by and it was relaxing.  Now let me remind you this is a Tapas Bar.    Great finger foods and a mix of Greek, sushi, and all american finger foods.  Didnt try their drinks only had beer.  But overall great service and great food.  This is a must stop by at least once type of place."}
{"text":"Happy with everything! Price, service, quality... we went as a group of 6 and ordered a lot. Glad we had a chance to try a lot of things. I personally loved the sushi rolls and banana pudding dessert the best but all the others were so good to! Will come back again!"}
{"text":"The waiter was exceptional but food-wise I don't see the hype. Most definitely not worth the crazy wait time (or any time)."}
{"text":"This restaurant has great feel. Super laid back & mellow atmosphere. Sophisticated drinks with a reasonable price. Dinner was comprised of a rich assortment of tastes from various tapas dishes including Sashimi Fish Tacos, Pork belly shells and cheese, spicy tuna rolls, saganaki... all of which were fantastic. Staff is friendly and helpful. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'd like to believe I maybe the queen of all things delicious.  While living in the Queen city, I had a Charlotte restaurant bucket list, and leaving Charlotte, was the reason I had to kick said bucket.  Soul Gastrolounge was on the top of it. If you haven't been to Soul yet, here's 5 delicious reasons why you should.  - Guacamole Stack: Simplicity is king with this healthy and appetizing take on Guacamole. Yum! - Ahi Tuna Tacos: A great ways to serve up Ahi Tuna- they're not just for Tuesdays. - Lamb Lollipops: Incredibly rich and succulent. - Ramen Bowl: Mouthwatering slurpable noodles. Slurp, nom, Soul.  - Cucumber Mule: On tap!  Just do Charlotte a favor and don't eat everything on Soul's menu at one time.  Four and Three Quarters Yelp."}
{"text":"Went for the first time for my birthday and sat at the bar. Bartender was great! Made me a special cocktail that contains the alcohols I enjoy. And the food was amazing! I've been back three times in the last month 1/2!!! I've had just about everything on the menu now and have yet to be disappointed! Lamb lollipops, duck sandwich, avocado salad, scallops and shrimp (was a special that day), even the sushi!!! It's a must try in plaza midwood for tapas !!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are die-hard foodies, and we've eaten some amazing dishes all over the world. I have to say though, Soul is easily one of my FAVORITE Top 3 restaurants of all time!  The food is flawlessly and consistently executed (so rare these days), and the environment is laid back and unpretentious.  Must orders: pork belly tacos, dirty south nachos (trust me on this), salmon 'o pita, Charlotte roll, the foie gras, and the pierogies on the brunch menu.  Can't say enough great things about this place!!"}
{"text":"Whenever I have family or friends visiting me in Charlotte this is one spot I always take them.    You must get there early enough to get a table outside to watch the sunset in order to get the full effect! Seriously incredible to watch from this spot! The city view adds so much to this amazing place!   Where do I even start with the food! You must get the truffle fries I always ask for sirracha to dip them in. It adds a great spice! You can't go wrong with any of the small plates or sushi. I love the spider roll! If you go here often they have a specials menu so there is always something new to try.   This is highly recommended if you want to impress your guest!"}
{"text":"A great place to get together with people. I'm glad I took photos to remember all the great things we had. Food was reasonably priced as well as the drinks. Some of the highlights were the pork-belly and watermelon tacos and the ramen with mushrooms and veal cheek. Sushi was good, but a bit over-sauced for my preference."}
{"text":"Awesome! Been to Soul several times. Grill Greek cheese, bone marrow and lamb chops are a favorite."}
{"text":"Literally my favorite place in plaza. All the bartenders , servers, and host are really awesome! The menu is tapa style which enables you to try multiple items in one sitting. The cocktail menu changes seasonally and never seizes to amaze me! One thing that's a must for me is consistency and they have it with their service,food, and the cocktails doesn't matter who prepares it!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday night for dinner and were lucky enough to get a table right away. The food was absolutely amazing!!! We ordered a bunch of small plates to share and each one was incredibly delicious. Since we sat outside on the deck, we were able to catch the sunset."}
{"text":"Kickin tapas with some top notch sushi and open late? Killer bar too! We sampled the oysters which were perfectly fried. The ham plate was filled with tasty choices and the truffle fries and baconed Brussel sprouts were exceptional. Minor note would be toasts are dry and too many of them are a downer as is the pounding techno beat. Achieve hipster haven at a lower decibel"}
{"text":"I took some friends to Soul last night to celebrate a good friends 26th birthday. I haven't been in a while and it use to be a favorite hangout for me. As always it met my expectations in the highest way. Staff, Bar, Hostess, and Server...Top notch. The food was as it always was, interesting and Delicious. (Try the bone marrow). Andy, whatever you are doing don't change a thing. On and did I mention that we has a beautiful table outside on the patio? It sealed the evening as perfect for everyone at my table."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! It's the perfect spot to enjoy modern food. It's the perfect atmosphere. Lastly, you can't come here and not order the french fries, I swear they were made with angel tears!"}
{"text":"It doesn't get better than this, never disappoints, always top notch. If you're looking for tapas in Charlotte you have found the place- look no further.   p.s. No Reservations here- get your name on the list EARLY and bar hop for drinks elsewhere while you wait. Expect a wait, it's packed for a reason. :)"}
{"text":"A little pricey, but delicious! Ahi Tuna Tacos, fried oysters and special foie gras meatballs were amazing!"}
{"text":"Came for a conference, stayed for the fried chicken nachos. I met up with an old friend who suggested that we grab some Tapas at this trendy little gastropub. We skipped the line and snagged two seats at the bar. I swear, I must've had 4 orders of the fried chicken skin nachos. These were BOMB. We all secretly only like the skin on fried chicken..and they serve it to you on a plate covered in nacho topping goodness. We tried a few other tapas, all which were tastey. But really, get the nachos.   If I ever find myself back in Charlotte, I'll be here."}
{"text":"I'm weak willed and went back.  The last few times they have redeemed themselves.  Great food and service (can't beat small plates in my book) and the music is pretty stellar. All around, usually have a pretty darn good time here."}
{"text":"I can't even begin to describe how good this place is. Trust the reviews and do yourself a favor ...go try it out!  While your there...try the pork belly tacos. They are sinfully good. You cannot go wrong with Soul Gastrolounge."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped by for late night eats. The service was just as good as if we came for an earlier  dinner. I had the tuna tartar tacos. They were delicious! What I most liked about this place is the option of lighter and heavier meals. You can't really go wrong with what you order. Everything that came to our table, I'd order a second time."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a late night dinner and some drinks and the place was packed but we didn't have to wait longer than a beer by the bar before being able to sit and order some grub.  We went with sushi since is was such a warm night and neither of us was could commit to downing anything that warmer than the weather.  Between the two of us we got the vegetable roll, ki roll, spicy tuna roll, and salmon nigiri.  The rolls came out fast and disappeared equally as quickly.  They were delicious!  Fresh and wonderful.  Between the food, frosty beverages, and awesome tunes the DJ was spinning I left feeling full, tipsy, refreshed, and completely satisfied!"}
{"text":"Soul Gastrolounge is a fabulous place to go for the best drinks and tapas plates in town! They are always busy after dinner on the weekends and there usually is a very long wait. But that only speaks to how great this place is. We went around 7:30 hoping to have a few drinks and bites before heading uptown. Until we were told the wait was about 3 hours! So we went uptown and had dinner first and came back after 10:30pm on Saturday. We had drinks and dessert. I had the The Secretary. What a wonderful drink. Somewhat spicy and strong with grapefruit bitters and basil. A VERY nice combination. The wife had the chocolate bread pudding. I'm not a fan of bread pudding but I must say, it was delish. It was very loud so we could hardly hear each speak. After 10 the dj begins playing the flavor of the night. Frankly, We are fans of the earlier hours. But still, what a great place for drinks and food!"}
{"text":"I'm so in love with this spot. I have the no wait app so I don't have to wait in line. It's very busy on Friday nights. Small inside but does have outside seating. Decent drinks and there is a bar there. Servers are great! The food is the bomb.com!!!! Pork belly tacos my fav and I always try new items. I love everything, even the cucumber water!"}
{"text":"No stranger to this place, I have been here multiple times and I love the vibe and the atmosphere! Food is great and so are the drinks, which is a plus. Have the pork belly tacos w/watermelon. Thank me later.  DJ is great even during the week, which I can appreciate on a Thursday eve around 10:00. Always a pleasure and it does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Reallly great food and drink at this one!! Well worth visiting!! Try the pork belly macaroni!!"}
{"text":"So, I finally made it over here after hearing about it since before I even moved to Charlotte. I love the space and the vibe; it's even cool that it's only accessible via what is essentially a fire-escape ladder. I love the bar that it hovers above (even though I can never remember if it's called Twenty Two or Twenty Three) and I love. Love. LOVE. Plaza Midwood in general. My hopes were high for Soul.  My ONE gripe - it's easily the restaurant I've had the toughest time finding gluten-free options in since I've been in Charlotte. I never want to be that person, so I didn't even ask the waiter for suggestions, but I'm not sure I would have been able to hear her anyway - place is LOUD. Boyfriend and I were there on a Wednesday night at 7pm and we could barely hear each other across the small table. Side note: there was about a 45-minute wait. On a random Wednesday night. It's a popular spot.  And still, you say, Soul deserves 4 stars? Really, Amy? Well, everything we had was absolutely incredible. As mentioned before, I'm an annoying gluten-free bitch. Even though I didn't eat 1/3 of the ingredients in the pork belly tacos (flour tortilla), the other 2/3 (pork belly and watermelon) were delicious enough that I'm still salivating over them 3 weeks later. Holy eff, that combination is deadly. Sweet, salty, indescribably amazing.  Brussel sprouts were some of the best I've ever had. Fries were BANGING. Sushi was decent, but we probably ordered the wrong roll (crunch roll) - some other rolls floating around the restaurant looked better. We only spent about $45 due to the fact that most of the other items had unavoidable gluten. But I can still safely say that I get it, Charlotte. This place is something special."}
{"text":"Hipster central. While the food is good, I don't think I'm nearly cool enough to ever step foot in this place again. Everyone from the hostesses whispering to each other (who needs 2 hostesses in a restaurant with less than 15 tables anyhow??) to our haughty waitress made me feel judged. I'm willing to admit it's totally a personal problem, but I just felt uneasy and uncomfortable all night.   As I mentioned, the food was good -- and surprisingly affordable -- but I'm not convinced it's worth the wait and attitude you have to deal with. We had the dirty south nachos (great), shells and cheese (good), brussel sprouts (good) and Korean wings (tasted burnt, below average). I'm not sure I want to dissuade anyone from trying Soul if you're curious but I doubt I'll ever be back. So, by all means, if you want to test your cool quotient, pay them a visit. ;) There's just way too many great, non-hipster restaurants nearby -- Bistro La Bon, Dish, Fern -- for me to give them another chance."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. Great food.  Must have the pork belly tacos. Out of this world! Everything we had was great, although I wasn't crazy about the Bone Marrow.  Dirty South Nachos, veal short ribs, chimchurri beef skewers, spider-roll sushi.  It was all great, even the Rocky Mountain Oysters (which were a first for me).  I would definitely go back again.  In fact, I'm ready now."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to visit Soul for years and hadn't had a chance to make it. I'm sooooooo glad I made the time. Which led me to visiting twice in a weeks time!!! Oh how I love the Pork Belly tacos with the watermelon salsa. It's a must try! The Lobster Ramen special was amazing. The burgers were awesome! The shrimp skewers and the chimichurri beef skewers. Oh and the Korean wings! Oh and the feta pimento cheese dip. All amazing. I would've skipped the truffle fries, needs some type of dipping sauce in my opinion and the Brussels weren't amazing. And although it doesn't seem like a lot of food, trust me it will be more than enough to share. Everyone order a couple of things and then if it's not enough order some more. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"There's a bit of a wait when you go, but it is well worth it. Here's what I ordered with a friend:   Shrimp Ceviche (my favorite thing here!) - It had coconut milk and lime with a little red onion and fried plantains. It was phenomenal.   Ham and manchego cheese on toast - they give you a whole slice of cheese, wrapped in ham, on a crostini - it was wonderful   Lamb Lollipops - good, a little pricey, but worth it if you enjoy lamb.   Beef skewers with chimichurri sauce - the chimichurri sauce tasted like blended parsley - t wasn't very flavorful but the beef was marinated well.   Dip trio - hummus, baba ganoush, and tzaziki sauce. The tzaziki sauce was great, the hummus was well prepared, and the baba ganoush was okay. Will not order again.   They ran out of a lamb lollipop (since they are supposed to come in threes) so we received the cupcake of the day. I couldn't figure out what the flavor was, but it was great! This needs to be eaten right away, since the frosting melted by the time I ate the meal."}
{"text":"Oh man, the line is long but worth the wait. We waited 2 hours (small party of 3) on a Friday evening. The drinks were good, ambience fun and inviting. The food was delicious. I'd recommend going an off daytime/evening to avoid the wait. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"What can you say that others haven't? Always amazing. Music bumpin and awesome atmosphere with consistently exceptional food."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte for business and knowing NC was home to badass BBQ, I did serious research only to throw all of the pork BBQ joints out the window when I discovered that NC was host to an impressive array of home-grown chefs doing some amazing work with local ingredients.  Soul Gastrolounge seemed like such a funky place -- a hip lounge off the beaten path with sushi and Greek classics on the same menu. The space is small, but that's not a bad thing. Dark and intimate, I saddled up to an empty bar (I ate solo on the early side on a weeknight), ordered a PBR and decided to go to to work on some bone marrow, anchovy fries and saganaki. Obviously, I wasn't planning on hooking up wiht anyone later (which was very much appreciated by my wife back home).   The bone marrow was served alongside some pickled red onion, parsley and thin, toasted bread. I love that bone marrow is making a foodie comeback -- poor people's food now finding its way onto respectable menus and savored for the deliciousness it's always been. The acidity of the red onion/parsley cut the richness of the beef butter just right. The only complaint I have is that the toast points were too thin and too crispy to properly soak up the richness once it melted into the bread.  The anchovy fries were true rockstar food as I don't have many friends that would join me in this adventure. I love the saltiness of a fresh anchovy. Dredging them in flour (cornstarch, perhaps) and flash-frying them made an already good thing amazing. The lemon aioli that came accompanied it was proper -- those little fishy fishes vanished quickly in between bites of bone marrow slathered toast and...  So I had never had saganaki - this beauty of fried, then ouzo-flambed cheese that Greeks have enjoyed for generations -- until this fateful night. And wow -- worth the wait. Perhaps, I didn't need the extra dose of saltiness given my anchovy fries and pickled red onions, but the salty cheese was incredibly satisfying -- especially when washed down by a cold, domestic brew.   Soul Gastrolounge boasted quite an impressive menu of small plates and if I was a local, I'd make a point to hit them all. The bar was a perfect place to perch as it allowed me to watch the team of cooks prepare my meal. Given the size of the kitchen, which is about the size of my coat closet, these guys and girls really know what they're doing and are so intentional in what they serve their loyal fans. Charlotte is lucky to have them around."}
{"text":"The prices remain the same but the portion sizes are even smaller. I remember back when you could get 3 pork belly tacos for $12, now it's only 2 tacos. We got Brussel sprouts as well thinking that would be a decent portion but there were about 10 making it $1 per sprout! We also got the shells and cheese (super rich) and the hoisin glazed shortribs (again super rich). The best thing we got were probably the truffle fries. The sushi will always be my fav here but everything else just got so much more expensive!"}
{"text":"An amazing place for tapas/drinks/dinner. Really fun place to try new and different foods. Love the atmosphere of the bar and sitting outside with a view of the skyline. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The food was great but I think it's a little overpriced for the portion. I understand it's a tapas restaurant. I found everything more appealing because it was very posh environment. I would go back again but I'm not necessarily in a rush. Their pastry smoked salmon tapas was my favorite."}
{"text":"I always take guests here when they're in the town... specifically for the pork belly tacos!  and it gives me a great excuse to stop in! Love everything I've had there!"}
{"text":"This place hit me square in the face, in a good way!  Ended up here pretty spontaneously on a Wednesday night.  There was a 20-30min wait, but they were super busy (for good reason!).  I was a bit hungry and annoyed that we are waiting for a table this long on a weekday, but the wait was well worth it!  Our server was great, she recognized that it was our first time here and explained the menu and how it all worked with tapas and her recommendations.  She recommended that each of us (there were 3 of us in our group) order two plates.  We put in an order of edamame and we were off to the races!  I chose the Sashimi Tuna Tacos (heaven in 2 bites) and Shrimp Ceviche which was an awesome way to end the meal since it came out last.  My cohorts chose the special:  fried shrimp with alfreado linguine and a crunch roll;  and the other two plates were soul wings and sticky veal shortribs.  Everything was excellent.  It was fun having all the small plates and being able to try everything.  We were lucky enough to get an outside table and halfway through the meal it started raining, but they have covers that rolled down to keep the splashing to a minimum.  The inside looked pretty cool and loungy - not many tables inside (hence the wait), but overall I am definitely coming back here to try some more tapas!"}
{"text":"I went here with some people I met through one of my dinner groups.  Having only driven by and never stopped it was time to experience another place I've heard such rave reviews on.  First off, it's not a place that is good for the differently abled as it is on the 2nd floor and access is via the steps outside.    Up the steps, you see a few tables outside on a metal catwalk.  Inside it's fairly dark with mood lighting.  There's a bar that extends to the small kitchen and sushi prep station.  To the left if a DJ area and more comfortable seating.  To the right are 3 booths with high backs so you cannot see the tables next to you.   Our group of 5 was seated here.   There is an interesting selection of wines.  One of my friends and I were intrigued by the Velvet Devil Merlot so we both ordered this.  Good stuff.   Now for ordering.  We ordered in spurts.  Tried a few plates and then added more 2 times, trying everything from a sampler to a cheese platter, then moving on to proteins with the ham plate, the shrimp ceviche, the shrimp sashimi tuna tacos, the spanish chorizo,   Everything was tasty but I think my favorite was the sashimi tacos which is way outside of my comfort zone.  The spanish chorizo almost had the texture of beef jerky,  There's nothing wrong with that, I just wasn't expecting it.  Same with the Shrimp saviche.  I wasn't expecting it to be so saucy with the coconut milk.  This is definitely a good place to go with a group because you get to sample everything,  And it does fill you up.  None of us had room for dessert.    The place is relatively inexpensive.  After 2 drinks each, and about 10 different tapas, we decided to split everything evenly 5-ways and it only ended up being $26 each.    The only flaw was with our server.  When we wanted to order more food, we didn't see her for about 15 minutes and had to flag her down.  This cost the 5 star rating."}
{"text":"one of the best places I've eaten in a long, long time.  the pork belly/watermelon is life-changing. coconut milk in ceviche revolutionary. and the friend goat's cheese wonderful.  add in a fabulous staff and killer drinks/views and it's no wonder why this is the place to be in Charlotte.   I could not be more impressed."}
{"text":"This is the best place to come for costumer service. Stephanie was an amazing bartender as well as Alison as server. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great drinks and tapas. Our party of 3 ordered a little of everything which worked great as each item came with three servings. Everything was amazing. The pork belly tacos and ahi tuna  skewers were unreal. We didn't try the ramen bowl but the table next to us raved about it. We would definitely come back the next time we are in charlotte."}
{"text":"This is one of my very favorite restaurants in Charlotte. It is not a secret. This place is known for being delicious- and it is. You can't make reservations. I do not recommend this place with a big group of friends. Try to avoid the crowds on Friday and Saturday. Some of my favorite dinners at Soul have been during the work week when it is a little quieter.  This is the sort of place where you can dress up at. You don't have to- but no one will look at you strange if you decided to go all out.  The food is delicious. The Soul Roll is my favorite sushi in town. The fries are INCREDIBLE. The Lamb Lollipop will make you forget about lambs being cute and instead you will find lambs tasty.   Ideally- go here with 4 friends. Share food together.   The cocktails are always incredible. Adam is a creative bartender. If you see him- ask him to make you something unique- he usually tries to use local ingredients and it is not always on the menu."}
{"text":"First time dissatisfied at the lounge! Tuna tacos were horrible couldn't eat them, service was a joke. But all is well I'm sure it was just a fluke and I will be back soon.    Update: favorite lounge on the easy coast! I'm in Hawaii now and miss it terribly."}
{"text":"Soul is the best spot in charlotte to have drinks and eats. The atmosphere and service is one of a kind."}
{"text":"It's tiny, and they don't take reservations.    I went with a friend on a Monday evening about 7ish and it was very busy.  We were glad to find a couple of seats at the side bar.    They have a patio, but they could do more with it and should.  If you've got a view like that, I'd splurge on a better quality winter enclosure so you could seat that space.  We tried several things, Ramen Bowl, Pork Skewer, Salad, Fried Oysters, Salmon-kopita, and maybe something I've forgotten.  The Salmon-kopita was in the lightest, crispiest wrapping ever, but they should give your a warning - I bit into one and blistered the roof of my mouth immediately, it was boiling hot inside.  It didn't taste like salmon at all, though, but it was crispy and creamy and had a good flavor.  So I guess not being salmon-y would be a good thing for some people.  The Pork, Oysters and something else were good, but the Ramen Bowl with Braised Veal and Fried Goat Cheese stuffed Mushroom Balls with Garlic Cream Sauce was phenomenal!  I like that so much I went back the next night and got it again.  I think this is a fun place with interesting options and I will go again."}
{"text":"Hat's off to the chef, and staff, but especially the chef, all of the food here is amazing, and to top it off the music and ambiance is great as well!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. The wait times are usually absurdly long, so I delayed trying Soul for a long time. When I finally did eat there, I found the menu was hit-or-miss. Only about half the tapas we tried were any good. The meatballs were unremarkable and the shells and cheese were a no-go: the intense sweetness of the BBQ pork belly in it didn't pair well with the heavy cheesiness...just an overwhelming dish, and far too sweet. Portions were also pretty small, given the quality of the food. Service was pretty good, as was my cocktail, but I don't think the food was good enough to warrant coming back."}
{"text":"We knew we wanted to take our friends from out of town somewhere delicious and unique, and I had this spot recommended to me time and time again. So we decided to try it out.  We were not disappointed.  We chose to sit inside, which was definitely the best choice. The atmosphere, the couches, and the lighting make the inside the better choice. Soul has a great lounge-feel with interesting music and amazing food & drinks to compliment.  I had a glass of champagne, while others tried local beers. The champagne complimented the food well.  For four of us, we ordered six tapas and all felt full afterwards (two men & two women in our group). I think when you're all snacking for an extended period of time, you tend to fill up and not feel like you need a full meal.  We ordered:  Porkbelly Watermelon Salsa Tacos: This was as incredible as everyone on Yelp says it is. It didn't look like much when we got it, but every bite was incredible. Two tacos come with this.  French Fries with Truffle Oil: Could. Not. Stop. Eating.  Dip Trio: Pretty good. I will probably forgo next time.  Lamb Gyros on a Skewer: Yes, yes, yes.  Soul Roll: Not nearly as spicy as I expected, but I can't really eat spicy foods so I thought it was perfect.  Queen Charlotte: Seemed like one of the less adventurous rolls, but it was one of the best sushi rolls I've EVER had.  I would bring anyone back to Soul and can't wait to go back myself. I love this place!"}
{"text":"So in love with this place!  The vibe inside is super laid back with cool urban beats in the backround.  The bartenders were making actual cocktails...they were muddling, mixing and shaking like crazy.  But the food was the best surprise.  We had the greek salad, saganaki, sushi and the short ribs and all of them were freaking awesome!  The short ribs were so tender and flavorful, my mouth is watering just remembering it.  I have been back many times and its great every time."}
{"text":"One of our absolute favorites in Plaza Midwood. The brussel sprouts, pork belly tacos, and guacamole stack are our favorites. The sushi is good. Ceviche was very spicy, hotter than we like. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food in this place is simply delicious and will have you coming back for more. This is my third time coming to this place (I was there on 05/02/2015) and truthfully I never had any complaints because the food is just downright good. Their french fries are a must and also, I ordered a mai thai and it was well done. Not too much alcohol and not too sweet, it was simply just on point. My steak and egg sandwich was oozing with extreme juicyness of delight and my company had the soul grilled cheese sandwich and just eating a tiny little piece I just wanted to snatch it off her plate and eat it all. Anyway, my waiter was simply the best. She was not only helpful and patient... she definitely did her best even when I wasn't happy. The only reason I'm giving this score a 4 is simply because the kitchen was moving extremely slow and I had to wait for my original order of fries for a very long time. One thing I do have to say to anyone that likes to eat big... this might not be the place for you. The portions are small, so if you don't like to eat small this is not the place to go. Highly recommendable and I will be back."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore Soul. For our first date my now boyfriend said I could pick anywhere in the city so I turned to a seasoned local for suggestions and Soul was the perfect choice. I love the concept of the tapas bar where everything comes out as it is ready. You can linger over plates and rest assured they are as fresh as possible and haven't been sitting under a light while the rest of the meal cooks. If you particularly enjoyed a plate, or are still hungry you can easily order more. As a first date spot it is trendy with delicious and very strong cocktails, and allows you to review important sharing attitudes. Does he give you the last sashimi taco? These things are important in a potential mate!   Next time I go I think I am just going to order several plates of the sashimi tacos.  They are beyond amazing marinated raw tuna in a fried wonton shell. Hands down my favorite dish in Charlotte.  Their sushi rolls are all tasty and reasonably priced for the size they provide. The pork in their pork belly tacos is super tender and the sauce on it is perfect (though I remove the watermelon from mine it just doesn't work for me). If you are feeling adventurous the bone marrow and toasts is a great flavor combination.   Soul can be affordable or it could be pricey. Their sushi rolls are large so you could make one a dinner if you wanted. The price spikes rapidly when you order several plates, or just one more of your favorite. The cocktails are about the price you would expect for the area, but they are shockingly strong. So in the end I actually think they are quite the deal.   Everything I have tried at Soul has been so delicious and the staff is very friendly. The only complaint I have with Soul is the wait time is underquoted. If you go during the week it shouldn't be too bad but last time we went was on the weekend and we were quoted an hour wait, but it took two full hours to get to our table. Being off by an hour is a pretty huge miscalculation. Only for you, Soul, will I wait so long for a table.   If you go on the weekend I would advise checking in and going to a nearby bar. They will text you when your table is ready."}
{"text":"Food is delicious! Some of the best options in Charlotte.  Sushi and tapas style dishes with extremely strong handcrafted or on-tap cocktails.  Sure it's expensive and parking is a pain, but it's one of the few high end food options in Plaza."}
{"text":"Love this place. Billy and kel behind the bar are so great and the small bites are great for sharing. Only downfall is how small it is and how long it can take to get a table, but it's worth it and the service is always pretty good"}
{"text":"Great service.  Great food. The tuna tacos & salmon sushimi is to die for... I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"What a cool spot in a cool neighborhood! I was in town visiting friends who suggested Soul as a good place for us to eat, drink, catch up, and people watch, and it was all of the above! When we arrived, our party was incomplete so we had a drink at the bar. Thumbs up for the local beers on tap. We then moved to a table nearby and started ordering a feast. As everyone else has stated, the pork belly tacos are AMAZING. Just get them. We also ordered the soul roll, the Brussels sprouts, and a flatbread... And devoured almost every bite. The service was great and our server was down to earth and made a lot of great recommendations. We sat at the short little table by the door so we were on the love seat/living room furniture but that was okay cause it was comfy. I will definitely come back here when I'm in the area, especially because there are decent bars nearby to go to after!"}
{"text":"To sum things up in a tidy little sentence:  Soul has a swanky vibe, indoor and outdoor seating, great service, and fantastic food/beverage selection.   My boyfriend and I headed over to Soul on a random Sunday night just after 5pm in order to get one of the coveted outdoor tables to enjoy the weather over dinner. We ordered a plethora of options to share, including:    - White bean goat cheese dip with pita points: so good that my boyfriend, who doesn't like goat cheese, devoured it. - Athenian tomato salsa: delicious - I thought it'd just be regular old salsa, but the seasoning was divine.  - Veggie roll: in order to entice my boyfriend into eating sushi, we started with this option, and he really liked it. Looking forward to more adventurous options next time. - Soul roll: this was my dinner roll - delicious with the jalapeno and spicy mayo for a bit of a kick.  - Tuna skewer: sauce that came on this skewer was very good, and it was seared perfectly.  - Chicken pita: great flavor and presentation.  They also make cupcakes in house and change flavors periodically, so be sure to try them all so you don't miss out!  Parking can be a bit tricky in that area, and the place fills up quickly on weekends, so head over there early if you don't want to wait. That said, there's always the bar to try out some of the fun cocktails if you do have to wait a bit - the bartenders at Soul are always friendly!"}
{"text":"This is really a terrific restaurant. Great food, great service. Creative menu. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Really bad brunch! I knew things were going to be bad when they had no sweet tea. You can't be a restaurant in the south called \"SOUL\" and not have sweet tea. Our waiter explained...\"We don't have sweet tea because the owner thinks it's gross\".   I ordered something called the \"Tortilla\". The name is deceiving as it didn't even have a tortilla in it. It was some kind of egg skillet thing that could have been good...but was not. Tasted like burnt eggs and that's about it.   I will show some love for the atmosphere. The place had a cool vibe...but that's about it."}
{"text":"I try this place last Sunday let me get straight to the foo we order humus dip, duck banh fit, souls roll and and pork belly. The humus haft of them were burn the duck banh fit bread we cold and chewy the roll were too small and the pork belly too salty .never again"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the environment and food at Soul Gastrolounge! Our server was great! I had the spider roll and it was yummy, not a big fan of tempura rolls so I won't get it next time. My partner had the Godzilla roll which was so goooood. I'm ordering that roll next visit :) We also tried the Dirty South Nachos, they were interesting but not my favorite. I enjoyed my first visit to Soul and definitely will be back next time I'm visiting Charlotte and have a taste for sushi."}
{"text":"Great spot in Charlotte! Really varied and unique food and cocktail menu. Probably my favorite restaurant in Charlotte so far. Made me feel like I was back in NYC , without the douche bags and shitty aspects. Standouts: Soul Roll, kamachi special, Korean BBQ wings, shrimp skewers. Pistachio Ice cream was awesome too. Great date spot or group of friends to chill with tapas-style food and drinks."}
{"text":"Brunch turned out to be such a disappointment! We've been to Soul for dinner/drinks before and it was GREAT! Decided to come back for brunch with some friends, and everyone at our table was pretty bummed with the experience. The service was SLOW to a point where we had to go look for our waitress, and the food was mediocre at best.  The menu looked awesome, but the food was anything but.  Stick to Lulu's for brunch...BEST EVER!  And only go to Soul for dinner/drinks."}
{"text":"Words cannot explain how wonderful this place is. Downside, its always packed, waiting is ridiculous but worth it, and they need to just rent out whatever is down stairs and team up with pinky and the brain. Its different and anybody can fit in here. Only thing missing is a dance floor! HaHa"}
{"text":"Hip spot with great ambiance and an eclectic menu. Five stars - will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"While in Charlotte for the week, I was given multiple recommendations to come to Soul, but was warned repeatedly about the crowds and long wait times. Being by myself, I was hoping to sneak in to a bar seat and after about 30 minutes of creeping behind some folks I did snag a seat. So... I didn't have to experience the foretold wait times. That being said, after my experience I would have waited multiple hours to experience the amazing food and cocktails that Soul offer up.   The people were amazing. Amanda, Kelly, Johnny(?), and Josh(? - sorry, I drank a couple too many cocktails and some names are fuzzy, but EVERYONE from the host stand to the DJ were impeccable). Their suggestions were spot on and they truly know mixology. I didn't have a sip I didn't enjoy and found a few of the libations completely unique. Toward the end of my evening they every suggested that I try to make the Punch Room before it closed for the night because they said that there I could find the pinnacle of cocktails. But I just couldn't leave the amazing experience I was having here.   As far as cocktails go, I will let you go there and have the staff explain them, because I'm not sure I could do that justice. They have some cocktails on tap which I was skeptical of but the one I tried was spot on. They had a drink, Black Lace,  with activated charcoal and porcini mushrooms - sounds weird? Yes. Was it my favorite drink of the night? Absolutely. The point is, I wouldn't come here and suggest drinking beer. These bartenders are on point and will guide you through the process to suit your tastes. Amazing!!  Lastly, the food. I ordered one thing at a time so my meal might seem to have been disjointed. But I enjoyed every bite. I started with Serrano and Manchego on Toast points. This is my all time favorite combo originating from Spain. I wish it had been served traditionally on a crusty bread BUT it was amazingly fresh and super generous. I then went to the dirty south nachos which were quite indulgent. These stuck out as the outliers. They didn't flow with anything else I ate but I would order them again. Then there was the cheese plate which was super generous as well, followed by the Duck Bahn Fit. This sandwich was so stupid good I wanted another immediately. But I had to try the sushi. This was the highlight of the night. I was convinced to go with sashimi. Whoever is cutting this fish is insanely talented. Non- traditional cuts but perfect to highlight each selection. At this point, these folks knew I was here to EAT so the chef sent me an amazing special soy sauce to accompany my last course (Many MANY thanks for this - truly unique). I basically rolled myself out in to the uber, but it was worth the slight discomfort. Thank you to everyone who made my night remarkable. I can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"lamb lollipops, tuna skewers, guacamole stack, wild mushrooms on toast are all amazing.  the tacos fell very short of expectations for me.  sushi is good too but I usually order the small plates instead."}
{"text":"I have to say, this restaurant was my favorite one until today. So disappointed right now. I don't usually write reviews but I really need to do it. Just got off from work, walked a few blocks to get there, patio totally empty and they refused to serve a table for me because my 23 pound dog. Two weeks ago went to the restaurant and they didn't have any issues with my dog. The hostess said it is the rules! Really since when? How come this wasn't the case last time, this shows the poor management. Please be consistent, if I  bringing my dog with me it is because I have been allowed to eat there before. My dog is not the first one that I have seen there before. Please don't waste my time. I prefer to miss the food than coming back ever again to this place. Maybe you are more lucky than me and can get service without any rejections."}
{"text":"I decided to try Soul for the first time last night. It was my 23rd birthday so i had 3 friends come with me. We didn't have a wait and got to sit on their nicely heated porch. I definitely think it helped that we were there on a Wednesday even though it was 7:15 because every review I've read is that you have to expect to wait at least an hour.   My one friend and i decided to split three dishes off of the Tapas menu. I love tapas menus because i always want to try at least 3 things and am hard pressed to pick just one thing. We split the Dirty South Nachos, Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos, and Shells & Cheese. The best part about the tapas is that they didn't all come at once. They gradually brought the dishes out so we had a natural progression throughout the meal.   After eating their Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos I made sure to tell everyone that these would be served at every major life event that I have. They will be served at my wedding, the birth of my children, and every birthday in between. I was so skeptical of these because the watermelon on top, but boy have i never been so happy to be proven wrong. If you take one thing away from my review it needs to be: GET THE ASIAN GLAZED PORK BELLY TACOS. Your tastebuds will surely thank you.   Do you like fried chicken? Do you think the best part of fried chicken is the crispy skin? Then the Dirty South Nachos are for you. They are delicious and perfectly seasoned and crispy. The pimento cheese that they are on top of is a nice compliment to the \"chips\". You get about 5 large \"chips\" and that's more than enough.   The Shells & Cheese were great. It was essentially perfect mac and cheese elevated to the next level with their fantastic pork belly again. Between the three things we got we had left overs and it was A LOT of food. I felt like i was going to have to be rolled out of the restaurant.   My other friend who came with us got the Guacamole stack. It looked delicious and so pretty. It is definitely on my list of things to try next time i'm there. My last friend got a sushi roll but i can't remember which one. She said it was great as well.  All in all i am definitely coming back to Soul Gastrolounge any time i can."}
{"text":"Got there at 6:15 on Monday night and was seated immediately!  Happy I did as by 7 there was a wait.  Colette served us. She was VERY helpful with the vast menu and guided us through a great dinner.  We had  6 \"small plates\" between 2 of us and could not finish.  Each plate was delicious...the lamb lollipops were thick and juicy...in my opinion they needed a tad more seasoning but were a good value! From the bruschetta to the fried goat cheese to the martinis it was a great meal.  The table next to us FORCED us to try their chocolate bread pudding ......I will never be the same!  Thanks for everything!"}
{"text":"5 Stars for creative ambition in place where there really aren't that many places just trying to come up with different things so for that I'm going to break it down dish by dish. Still execution could be better and I wouldn't necessarily wait again for it.  Souther Style Nachos - Fried chicken skins with cheese. This should be a grand slam in the you like rich food at a biological level, yet the chicken skins get soggy quick and the cheese congeals. There has to be a way to make the cheese less solid and the chicken more so.  Gyro - Not as good as town tavern, maybe better than showmars but that's no standard to go by.  Southern Fried Chicken Wings - these were legitimately great. Good size, juicy through the middle, great breading. Get them if you go.  Pork Belly Tacos - I like the watermelon on it but the texture is much to hard. The whole point of pork belly is to have it be incredibly soft. If you over cook it, or cook it at too high of a heat and it gets rough you might as well eat a healthier cut of pork.  Serrano and Machego Crustini - Bread was too thick and not toasted enough resulting in a pretty doughy concoction.  Anchovy Fries - Chinese people do this with smelt and it works a lot better. Anchovies don't have the consistency to not get soggy and really just end up being too soggy. I grew up eating these at home and was really disappointed   Lamb Meatballs - Just too tough. Probably needs more bread and less time in the oven.  Flatbread - Too rich, not enough texture.  These reviews may sound too hash but if you're going to try to do new an interesting things basic execution is paramount. The positive is that these are all problems that can be fixed with practice while good ideas don't' come out of nowhere."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing and worth the hype!!! One of those places that makes you want to shake hands with the Chef and say thank you. Unbelievable food!! Best in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Still am a fan of this place but I have to revoke my sushi recommendation. The last three times I've gone their sushi has been absolutely horrible ...not fresh but fishy, messy, bleh. What happened to my sushi fondu roll ? You use to be so good, bummer. I'm not sure if they changed fish vendors or sushi chef's but please go back to what you had before...pretty please.   I do have a few new recommendations though: Shrimp ceviche - hell yes! Light coconut flavor served with a plantain chip mmmm. Also the mojitos are delicious! I wish they added some fruit varieties besides mango (too sweet for me) but they are definitely worth having (served in a pint glass - not some dinky small glass)"}
{"text":"I've tried to eat at Soul Gastrolounge three times and am now officially giving up.  I'd tried once shortly after it opened and the wait was over an hour for a table - so we left because we figured we would wait until the hype died down to try the place.  I tried again a month or two after opening and during on a weekday when I was quoted 45 minutes to wait for a table - so we went to the bar and ordered a drink. After we realized the host had not asked for names and had no rhyme or reason for picking people from the bar to be seated, we left again.  I tried about 2 weeks ago on a Sunday to get an early dinner. We were actually seated (what a miracle), however the service was absolutely terrible. The server came and brought drinks then vanished. We waited for 25 MINUTES in hopes the server would come back to our table to take our food order - but he didn't. So we got up and left.  I've given up. There is no way the restaurant is worth that many attempts to get a table or worth the complete lack of service from the last visit."}
{"text":"Soul is hands down one of the best restaurants where you can try a little bit of everything. There was no wait; however, we went on a Monday evening. We got the sashimi tuna tacos (those were my favorite), salmon-o-pita, country Greek salad and the Red Dragon Roll. All of which were very delightful. I am looking forward to going back and trying new menu items!"}
{"text":"A friend took me here for my birthday. Seating is first come/first serve. Upon arrival, I gave hostess my phone number and they would text me as soon as a table became available. Watched people come and go. An hour later and we still hadn't been seated. When I inquired about how much longer it would be, turns out the hostess wrote down the wrong number. We were seated immediately after that, but it took a while for waiter to bring drinks and take order. As far as food selection, menu is unique in offerings. I went with the pita chips and tzatziki dip, fried goat cheese on bruschetta, and mini burgers. Server did not check in with us often and forgot my burger order. I finally got it and manager apologized, but due to lack of attention I passed on ordering the sushi as we had already been there a long time. We also got free drinks because of the inconvenience. Even with the poor service, the food was absolutely delicious and I would be willing to give it another try."}
{"text":"great spot, sometimes too crowded but still worth the wait.  always have great tunes spinning and great drinks flowing.  food 8 times out of 10 is on point, just dont get too out there, read: bone marrow made me sick as a dog once but i'll still go back."}
{"text":"I am between 3 and 4 stars, the food, place and overall experience are all amazing. The draw back, JUST TAKE RESERVATIONS!! how hard can that be! the place is small and always crowded, the least I had to wait when I go there is 45 minutes. I went there last night, my friend and I were there at 8, the wait was an hour and 45 minutes! I left my name so they'd text me, they did at 11, so that would have been a 3 hours wait,, uh NO!! so please just take reservation!!"}
{"text":"So the only positive of your birthday falling on a Monday is that you get to go to Soul and not even have to wait for a table. Place is intimate. Really intimate. As in I felt like I was also on a date with the tables on either side of me. Thats seriously the only con from my experience last night. It's a great place to go for a special occasion because you can justify ordering half of the 10,000 things you want. Plus the tapas style of dining is perfect for conversation because you eat a little, then take a break.  We came for the pork belly tacos. This is a dish that actually lives up to the hype. I feel like so many of the \"must eat in charlotte\" things don't. The flavors were incredible. Really simple but the sauce on the pork belly and the watermelon were perfect compliments. I could have eaten 12 more.   Next were the dirty south nachos. I am personally not a fan of fried chicken skin I now know. The pimento cheese and pickled okra they were topped with were very good though.   Korean BBQ wings...amazing. Truffle fries. Our server described as like crack. He was right. I was full as could be still picking at them.  I ordered the sushi roll that was on special. It was really good, I just couldn't finish it, because, see above. Boyfriend got the ramen bowl. The sauce on the ramen was delicious.   Our server Marlon was great the entire meal! Very attentive without being annoying and made some excellent recommendations on the menu, for our table and others.   All in all, it was the perfect way to celebrate my birthday! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"What a first time experience for me! My girlfriend and another friend in our group had already been able to live the Soul Gastrolounge experience, and they had nothing but good things to say! I was ready.  Ironically, my girlfriend had asked if I had been there before as we passed by heading to nearby Resident Culture Taproom. After a few hours and a few cold ones there, it was time to get the grub on... What came up among a couple other options? You guessed it. Soul!  Parking is a bit rough around the Midwood area, but we managed to squeeze the ol pickup truck in a spot at a nearby closed business. There was a bit of a wait, unless we wanted to sit outside in the covered area with supposed warmers. We chose to wait a few minutes, which turned out to be not that bad at all while they cleaned the awaiting booth for our group. We started with our drink orders. It took quite some time for the waitress to return to start our food order and in that time frame, they ran out of the sushi roll of the day special. That was frustrating since we waited to see her comeback so we could order one. Anyway, we ended up going with a Soul original roll. That was very tasty. We then moved on to the following tapas:  - ASIAN GLAZED PORK BELLY TACOS: First off let me say, I was excited about this because I am not a fan of pork belly .. or should I say, WASN'T a fan of pork belly until the SG version of pork belly entered my life. Combine that with the slight bite from the watermelon salsa chunk... makes you say OOOOWEEE.. like a pig.  - SHELLS & CHEESE: These were \"ok..\" Very cheesy, indeed. Filled with shredded style pork belly meat.  - FRIED MEATBALLS: Very tasty, especially combined with the yummy tzatziki!  - MINI BURGERS: Wow! Very delicious! Comes with three, we added a 4th (with an upcharge) since we had four people.  The fancy creative drinks are just that: fancy .. and pricey! But, you'll have that at a place that specializes in creative cocktails and liquor ON TAP! When you're in the need for the \"facilities\" there are two gender neutral lavatories near the rear of the establishment.  Everything we had was just fantastic and tasted great! We will definitely be back to visit in the near future!"}
{"text":"The menu selection was great. They have a lot of interesting options that I would've never thought to try. Loved it all, and the drink menu is awesome. Their cocktails are on point. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant. So many of mine and my bf's date nights are here and many dinners with my girlfriends are here. The wait can get extreme but the food is never disappointing! We always get the truffle fries, pork belly tacos, fried oysters, and at least something that we don't understand for the sake of it. I love eating weird things so I absolutely love having a place so close to home that stretches their menus past most people's comfort levels. Ask for Colette to be your server if she's available and the wait time isn't so long, she's an awesome server and always has the best personality! Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"I have only made brief stops to Soul, but on those trips, I've enjoyed it. The vibe is like Central Perk all grown up. Nice, comfy furniture, dimly lit (assuming you are there at night or at least after dark), and provided you manage to visit when the place is not packed, plenty of room to enjoy your stay.  The downside is that there can be times when there are just too many people in the place, and then it's a bit awkward. While the furnishings are nice, the lounge goes entirely out the window since there are only so many places you can do your lounging. This is not really a club, and if you are too late to the party, you will have a tough time finding room to lounge.  On a similar note, the mingling aspect is cool, the food is interesting, but it can be tough to eat - there just isn't that much space to spread out. You want to keep it small when ordering because the arms of those sofas cannot handle the entire buffet that you want from the menu. Either pick carefully, or take it slowly so you don't get overwhelmed."}
{"text":"Love this place! Hate the wait. I highly suggest making RSVP. We waited almost 2 hours. They give you water with cucumbers. I have tried the seaweed salad and it was fresh with just the right amount of sesame seeds. Chicken pita sandwich was huge! Tzatki sauce was so good. Perfect with red onions! The chicken was juicy. My favorite thing on the list is Korean wings. They talk a while to make but I promise you it is worth it. It was legit and I'm half Korean. I ate every last piece of meat on each wing and I had no shame licking my fingers. The sauce is spicy and the wings were crispy. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Wifey likes the Moscow Mules here so we ate here tonight. The food is excellent and our waitress, Alex, was very attentive. We ordered a couple entr√©es...LOL, Spicey Tuna Rolls, Midwood Mixed Greens Salad, Country Greek Salad, Fried Brussel Sprouts with Bacon Bits (OMG), Shrimp Ceviche and Humus of the day. Sounds like a lot but for those that don't know, this is a Tapas Bar. The atmosphere is nice, the music is played at a level you can still have conversations without raising your voice. The restaurant is kinda small and has outdoor heated seating also. We were there at 5:00pm and was a full house by 5:30pm. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"food is amazing. tuna tacos are so good. if you are looking for service dont go there though. its worth the wait though."}
{"text":"The mentions of waiting and waiting turned me off from coming here for a long time. We went on a Tuesday night around 630p and there was no wait. I think we got lucky considering it had just opened for the night but in the hour we spent there it filled up quickly. Once we got inside I could see why there's usually a wait - the place is small! Our waiter was really nice and came by at just the right times. He suggested we order three plates per person. We ordered the tuna tacos, the flatbread, the wings, the fries and a sushi roll.  Tuna tacos ($11); they come as an order of three. We got 4 instead for an upcharge I'm sure. Why have items come in threes when it's a sharing kind of place? Then someone is a jerk for eating the last one and someone feels like they got shorted one. These were good and I would recommend. They're two bites each.   Flatbread ($10) was dripping with cheese and honey; should just be called a mini pizza. Not very refined and sticky.   Korean wings ($9) were also really sticky. Don't order these unless you want to get up to go wash your hands.  Fries ($6) were like truffle fries at any other place; similar to the ones at Good Food on Montford. Greasy. Skip.  Queen Charlotte Roll ($10) was probably the best part of our meal; 8 pieces, I've had better but at least this was what we expected it to be. We ordered the fresh wasabi to go with this ($5). About a dime sized portion (see picture)  All of the above plus 1 cocktail and 1 beer came to $72. Is this real life? The quantity of food is very disproportionate to the cost. We should have just stuck with sushi because at least the price on the rolls is proportionate to the size of the item. It was okay but I wouldn't come back here. The reason we finally came was because we'd received a gift card from a friend. In theory being able to order items from different cuisines sounds like a good idea but in practice all those foods shouldn't mix. We both felt off afterwards. Save your money and your stomach for someplace else."}
{"text":"First time here tonight. Hanging out with friends and co-workers. I really enjoyed the tapas style dining. The atmosphere was warm and inviting with a great mix of culture. The food was excellent and our waitress was on point the whole time. The fresh cucumber water was refreshing. We were all comfortable and enjoyed the social scene. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Second visit! Be warned they don't take reservations so be prepped to either wait or grab a drink in the meantime. Me being the boring individual that I am, I opted for going to grab drinks at the Peculiar Rabbit next door. After all, turn down for what?  We received a text promptly at 7:45 as promised (approx. 45 min wait) and we headed on over. We were given the choice to either sit in a booth or at high top table. Our server arrived immediately to get our drink orders. I had a Moscow Mule (vodka, lime and ginger beer) which was absolutely delicious!   For tapas we got: Rocky Mountain Oysters, lamb lollipops, ahi tuna skewers and the Napoleon roll. Between the tenderness and seasoning the lamb lollipops are definitely a dish I will get again! (Sorry Mary, we ate your lamb). The sesame and soy drizzle on the seared tuna was delicious, I felt like licking the skewers! And the sushi consisted of tuna, cream cheese and jalape√±os lightly fried...OMG it was the best sushi roll I've had in a while. Now step lightly with the Rocky Mountain oysters because you might just get tea bagged! No seriously, they are the TESTICLES OF BULL CALVES! These are not for me (I'm a texture person and these were NOT firm to say the least) but rumor is a lot of people enjoy them here routinely...if it wasn't for the ranch...hmm testicles in ranch...yeah I'm going to leave that one there. To each his own!   Overall the food and drinks were absolutely amazing! And the atmosphere dim and intimate, while the elevated music put off a nice vibe! If you're looking for a great time, Soul is where it's at!   You're welcome."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in Charlotte for a date night or with 1-2 friends.   Food is fabulous/probably the best food in Charlotte I have had...always a hit. Love the ambiance/love the giant peacock that hangs above the bar!  Waiters make great recommendations on food and wine! Some of my favorites-white bean & goat cheese dip, guacamole stack, lamb lollipops with rosemary & pecorino, southern fried oysters.   Ask about the specials... Bar stools are very uncomfortable, I like eating at the bar if there is a long wait but not here bc you will keep sliding off if you have on a silk dress or leggings... Hostess is not very friendly, what is up with the rude hostesses in Charlotte... Don't go with a large group, you will NEVER get a seat.  Also, don't try to move your table around so you can be romantic and sit next to each other, you must sit facing each other or you will get scolded by the hostess. ( :  I do love this place...can't wait for my next visit, maybe tonigh!!."}
{"text":"Soul is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. The food and the drinks are awesome. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the wait. Every night of the week the wait is over an hour. They do call ahead seating but you have to do it a half hour before you go; therefore, if the wait is an hour and a half and you do call ahead, you still have to wait another hour when you get there. There is a bar under it, though, so you can go have drinks while you're waiting."}
{"text":"My girlfriend treated me to a birthday dinner there and the food was good. Dips were fabulous. Gyros a little dry. Environment a little noisy for conversations."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great space although their wait time is never as long as they say. Good drink list and awesome sushi. Staff are great too!"}
{"text":"We finally got around to trying Soul Gastrolounge for living in the area almost a year already. The wait times always deterred us. On Saturday we got there at 530p (opens at 5p) with no wait and were seated on the patio. Matt was our server and he was fantastic with recommending options and explaining the menu. We tried some things off the sushi menu which were fantastic: 'Joe Cool' sushi special roll, blue fin tuna, hamachi jalape√±o. We also tried a trio of dips: spicy feta, white bean and the tzatziki dip...all were fantastic. We also had the recommended pork belly tacos which were BEYOND CRAZY AMAZING! For dessert we had the featured cupcake and the filo dough wrapped banana and Nutella bites. Everything was fantastic and with the wait times, you just have to deal with it because the food is awesome."}
{"text":"This place has great food and a great bar. It's a little busy. We had poor service there once and the manager did his best to make us feel welcome. Every other time we've been there was great. One of our favorite spots in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the tapas style eating and drinking.  We got there as soon as it opened. There were choices for the vegetarian, not as much for a vegan and my meat eater husband was happy too. We ordered a bottle of wine and 6 or 7 tapas between us and it was a feast!"}
{"text":"Soul is a fun place to grab some good food and enjoy the laid back atmosphere. The service was excellent when I went. The pork belly tacos were amazing and the beef chimichurri was very good as well. The feta and hummus dips were both good but nothing outstanding. Overall the food was good, the service was superb, and the restaurant was pretty cool. The prices are high for the portions you get, but I guess that's sort of expected at a tapas bar."}
{"text":"Soul was the first restaurant recommended to me when I moved to Charlotte. Unfortunately I found that I really can't pass that forward. While it was trendy and hip and the service was really wonderful, the food was really not to our taste.   My companion and I finally got seats here at the counter - they don't take reservations, and they don't need to; it's so crowded always. We actually went to Workman's Friend for a few drinks while we waited. Luckily they will text (or was it call?) you when it's your turn. We were so excited to try some dishes. My dinner date and I have completely different tastes in foods, but we got a few different items to share.  Portion size was good, and we got the food very quickly, but EVERY single dish was so insanely salty we had difficulty eating it.   Korean BBQ Wings - Way over with the sauce. Way. Gochujang goes a long way, and this was just too much. It could have been diluted at least 2x. Not every millimeter of the wing needs to be coated in sauce. This made me sad. We were actually pulling the outer layer off so we could at least eat the non-coated chicken underneath.  Saganaki - Again, too salty. It was delicious, because how can you really go wrong with partially melted cheese that's been lit on fire? Even the little bits of toast that came with the cheese was pre-salted. Salt on top of salt on top of salt. If we didn't have heart or kidney issues before, I think we do now.   Dynamite Roll (I think!) - The flavors melded pretty nicely in this sushi roll, and the presentation was excellent. There was just one thing wrong. Take a guess. Yep, too much salt. It had a sauce drizzled on top of it and underneath, which, while had a great flavor, was too salty!  Wild Mushrooms on Toast - Toast, mushrooms, and a fried egg. How can you go wrong? You go wrong if there's too much salt. The toast was buttered or oiled with salt, the mushrooms were much too salty and oily, and the fried egg was of course salted.  As I stated, my companion and I have very different tastes in foods and neither of us enjoyed any of these dishes. The flavor underneath the salt was promising, and the presentation was all very nice. From what I could tell, it was a normal night. There were no neighboring complaints about food - just happy people stuffing their faces. I'm sorry we were not able to join in the enthusiasm."}
{"text":"Soul is a funky, fun little gastropub located on the second floor of an old brick building on east Central Avenue. It features an eye-popping menu ranging from wings to skewers to sushi, all executed with a careful hand and quality ingredients. We visited on a Sunday evening after a Panthers game and it was fairly well packed including the outdoor patio space. I can say that the food here justifies any wait you may encounter.   Our selections included the grilled caesar, which comes out on a lightly charred leaf of romaine lettuce. This was quite flavorful with its seasoned croutons. The pork belly pita was served with some watermelon salsa and red onions and was quite delicious. Sushi items were masterfully prepared; we enjoyed our California roll and the lightly tempura fried tuna and salmon sakana roll. My one disappointment was the highly anticipated pork belly tacos. The presentation has three large cubes of pork belly glazed in a sweet Asian-inspired sauce topped with three cubes of watermelon. This is somewhat unwieldy to eat but unfortunately, my pork was slightly overdone so it wasn't my favorite item on the menu.  One shining highlight was our chocolate bread pudding dessert.  Rich but not overly sweet, our baked pudding was crispy on the outside, moist on the inside, and served with a large scoop of pistachio ice cream.  Service is exceptional here from the maitre d' to the wait staff and bus boys. I felt very welcome here. It's busy often from what I gathered from the staff and doesn't accept reservations, although I was able to put our party onto the waitlist through Yelp. We didn't have to stand very long to get seated once we arrived. If you're looking for an excellent meal that's a bit offbeat and eclectic, this is the place you've been looking for. Recommended."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but the wait is ridiculous. I added my name to a 2 hour wait, came back an hour and 45 minutes later only to be told it would be another hour and a half wait. They won't let you put your name in until all of your guests are present, and they don't take reservations. I have WAY more sh*t going on in my life rather than to wait 3 hrs for a table at a slightly above average restaurant. Goodbye soul...it was fun while it lasted"}
{"text":"I came to the incredible realization last night that I haven't written a review for Soul yet?! Since I've eaten here, oh, I don't know seven or eight times, you think I would have gotten around to it by now. Nope. So, here we are. Months later and I've had many a dish at Soul. The interior is cozy and dark, the staff has always been friendly and helpful while choosing from their extensive menu. Yes indeed it can get crowded, so plan your evening accordingly! Here's the low down on the dishes I've tried:  White Bean & Goat Cheese Dip: 3/5: Tasty white beans mixed into a (cool) creamy goat cheese. Served with snappy little pita chips. I kind of wish it was warm, but the flavors make me come back to it often.   Goat Cheese Crostini: 4/5: Toasty balls of goat cheese atop a lovely crostini piled with tomato and onion. Yum.  Shrimp Ceviche: 5/5: Bangin'. Just damn good. Perfectly prepared and full of flava.   Guacamole Stack: 2/5: Meh. Not bursting with flavor and I'm always searching for some type of carb to pair with this lovely stack of avocado.   Tuna Tacos: 3/5: I love the fresh tuna & the sauce but I dislike the overly fried flavor of the encompassing taco shell.   Soul Roll: 5/5: DELISH. One of my favorite sushi rolls in Charlotte - 'tis flavorful, punchy and super fresh.  Gyro: 2/5: I prefer Showmars, frankly. The meat or mix within the meat tasted sweet?! A bit strange.   Cupcakes: 3.5/5: I've tried two types and had two different reactions. My first was a cookies & cream - it was tasty but dry. Sad face. Then, last night I tried the snickerdoodle cupcake - delicious, not dry whatsoever. Mouth watering cinnamony sugary goodness topped with buttery frosting. Nom.   I know I'll be back to this eclectic eatery soon - there is truly a dish for every bud and tastebud!"}
{"text":"If you want to have a good time with some good people around you? Well I say come here. I love coming here whenever I am in Charlotte because they have really good food and great drinks. I would include some personal times I was here but quite frankly a lot of them are blurred out from having too much fun. I love coming though for brunch on Sunday Mornings as they have one the best brunches I have ever had in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I love Soul.  Great place to get a small bite, or load up on the menu.  Atmosphere is great and the food matches it.  Charlotte needs more restaurants like Soul."}
{"text":"Great pork belly tacos.Small plates nice to try many items.Has good energy buzzing.Definitley will be returning next time in Charlotte."}
{"text":"People ask me all the time for suggestions on where to go to eat. This is easily one of the places in Charlotte I mention the most.  No, they don't take reservations. Just go ahead and get over it. Sure, it would be nice. You know what would also be nice? If they gave me free cocktails, but they don't do that either. See, it sounds pretty ridiculous now doesn't it? Expect a wait. There's a wait for a reason. Go early and put your name on the list, then walk downstairs to Twenty-Two or over to Workman's Friend for a drink. They'll text you when your table is ready.  If you looked through the user pictures on here, you've probably figured out that the pork belly tacos are the most popular item. I agree, they're my number #1 at Soul. I also like the tuna tacos, soul roll, and hamachi with jalapeno. My most recent adventure here was with the lovely Sarah C and we felt it was our duty to order the giant shells and cheese stuffed with pork belly. I can't think of anything on the menu that I've tried and didn't like. My roommate and her bestie love the shrimp ceviche. Cocktail menu is also great. I usually always start with a Tito's Cucumber Mule.   Price-wise, this is a place where you can very easily spend a lot of money. It's easy to get caught up in the delicousness and order a bunch of plates. Sarah and I split four small plates and three cocktails... $87 before tip.   Only other thing you really need to know: parking blows. The JLC WearHouse across the street closes at 7pm, so I'll park there or the breakfast place next door to it. Just make sure to pay attention to all the signs in this area before you park."}
{"text":"Great spot for a date night! Soul provides an intimate spot to grab fun tapas and it definitely felt like a special treat. Shout out to our waiter Marlon - he provided great recommendations and service!  The food at Soul is really quite good. The fella and I started off with the dip trio (because we couldn't pick just one!) and enjoyed that. Although we are big sushi fans, we opted to stick with tapas and ordered the pan con tomate, flatbread, and sashimi tuna tacos (couldn't quite stay away from the fish). I loved the pan con tomate and flatbread and I'm glad we opted for some of Soul's more unique items. The tuna tacos were good as well, but didn't have the culinary depth of the other two dishes.  While I loved the food, I was pretty underwhelmed by my cocktail. I normally don't order cocktails but had Soul had a good menu. Unfortunately, my Viking in Hades honestly tasted like a basic cran-vodka. The fella seemed to enjoy his James Ryan cocktail, so maybe I should just stick with beer and wine.  Overall, it was a great date night treat. I wouldn't come here on the reg because it's a bit pricier, but it's definitely worth checking out at least once!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness.. I thought I had written about this place after I woke back up from my amazing food mania that I had there. I loved the idea of tapas, because it was small samples of anything you wanted to try, so I could cram several of those plates in my face hole. We tried so many things, I can't even tell you how many plates we had in front of us. EVERYTHING was delicious and had flavor like I'd never tried.   The atmosphere was laid back, and everyone in there was friendly. It was artsy and mood lit inside and active and bright outside. Soul is like a hidden gem, that you don't know about until someone tells you how amazing it is. It's like being part of the fight club, except you're allowed to talk about it, and nobody fights.. err something... yeah.   Seriously I don't think you can go wrong with this place. There is nothing bad on the menu. At ALL. If I make it back down to Charlotte, I will have to head back into Soul for a quick bite. You Charlotte peeps are soooo lucky, with all that tasty food!!! :)"}
{"text":"This is only my favorite place in the WORLD to eat... The chocolate bread pudding is what you might imagine heaven to be like! Tuna, guac stack, cheese plate OH MY! Haven't had one bad thing yet."}
{"text":"Soul Gastrolounge is a pretty hot spot in Plaza Midwood for eclectic tapas and entrees. I ordered the spicy feta dip (not really spicy) with pita chips to start and then the Queen Charlotte Roll (i.e. sushi). Wasn't expecting the sushi to be as good as it was, but it was fantastic. The goat cheese on bruschetta (my friend ordered) was great as well. We sat outside with a beautiful view of the Charlotte skyline which was gorgeous. Topped it all off with the Vietnamese coffee ice cream which was pretty tasty. Wonderful service as well and deserving to be in the top 25 restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"My friend got the fried crab appetizer and loved it. The wings weren't as Korean as they were named to be. The dragon bowl of sushi wasn't as spicy as in the description and the drink was watered down. Also a really long wait to be seated out side. It was kind of frustrating. I had the edamame and tht was so good as it always is anywhere."}
{"text":"I would give them a 5 star except you can't make reservations so that kinda sucks. The food is amazing, the drinks are awesome, the vibe is lively the atmosphere is dim and sexy but nothing fancy!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch once and enjoyed it so I decided to try dinner. Ambiance is nice, outside seating available for the Spring and Summer months, staff is friendly, and food is delightful!"}
{"text":"Pretty neat little restaurant. No big sign or anything, but it was on the 2nd floor of a building.   My tip is to reserve online. The dining area is small if you want to eat inside. We opted for a table outside since the weather was nice.  I ordered the steak and egg sandwich. Open face sandwich for this one. It didn't look like a big portion, but it was filling.  Also get an order of the truffle fries. One order is enough to share between 2-3 people easy. We got 2 orders between 4 people and could not finish them. Delicious nonetheless.  Also got a side of mushrooms on the side. It was served cold and was pickled.  Nice drink selection as well. Overall, great spot to eat for small plates and to hang out."}
{"text":"arrived at 5:30 on a Friday with a party  of 4 and told it would be a 30 minute wait. then when sitting at a spot that looked exactly like the bar, told we had to move b/c it was actually 2, two person tables and they are in separate waiting areas so we could not seat 4! after 50 minutes a group of 5 \"neighborhood\" people came in and were seated in a corner table ahead of us! horrible service and no regard for customers that are not wearing skinny jeans. I don't care how good the food is, I will never return!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Charlotte.  Also try the lamb lollipops and tuna tacos.  Very trendy, great ambiance.  No reservations, be prepared for a long wait (biggest negative).  They don't give much of a pour if you order a glass of wine, go with a bottle, beer, or mixed drinks.  Usually a loud DJ with house music, but it works.  Whatever you do, don't order the chorizo.  I guess the disclaimer is that, by the time I sit down, it is usually two hours after I intended to eat, so I am starving, and I am three drinks to the wind at the bar waiting, so probably anything would taste good - particularly the fried/fatty offerings.  Perhaps that is their strategy.  Luckily, the ambiance is good so I can stand the wait."}
{"text":"So ... My fianc√© and I researched places all over Charlotte.  We wanted to go some where we would have thoroughly enjoyed.   To our dismay we were greeted by the host with scoffing and contempt. My whole party and our friends felt unwelcomed. We were not even offered drink or food menus while we were clenching through our egregious wait time. We were not served.  It's not Studio 54 people. It felt like we were pretty much just asked to leave. (Not directly.  Indirectly in a micro aggressive fashion . ) I heard exciting things about this place.  Be advised even on a late evening on a Thursday the service can be subpar.  We talked to a manager before we just left and went to spend our out of town money down stairs at a local bar. Please note: I don't believe Soul is wheelchair accessible either.  It's up a flight of stairs.  (Which we had to figure out after guessing. )"}
{"text":"One of my favorite go to restaurants in Charlotte.  They have the best sushi rolls and my favorite, lamb lollipops! Everything on the menu is awesome!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Soul! The environment is very romantic but because of that either plan to get there very early or wait for a table. The patio is very nice and somewhat secluded while the inside has more of a pub feel with live music on some nights. The menu here is a diverse array of small plates with lots of things to please everyone. My favorites are the sushi and the sliders. This place is a nice staple to the plaza midwood area and should be a priority for anyone in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This place used to the bomb. Friends and I frequented the Gastrolounge usually but not limited to Friday nights. I stopped going for good reason; the service and food went rapidly downhill . Even the staff started to quit. I thought they had undergone new management because it seemed everything fell apart at the same time. The food went from fantastic to mediocre and the one accommodating staff, now sucks. In their defense, they still have a wide selection of tapas which is hit or miss depending on your taste. Also, Soul has a good feel to it  Exposed brick walls and comfy booths and couches."}
{"text":"I think Soul has a lot of potential. It's in a nice location and has a nice atmosphere and is a great place to go for drinks.  My biggest issue with Soul was the service. I went for someone's birthday. She had called and made reservations for a large party,  which they had confirmed with her. But when we all gathered at Soul, the host told us that they do not accept phone reservations and made us wait for an hour and a half. He was kind of rude about everything.  As far as food goes, I really think Soul needs to spend some quality time perfecting a menu. I appreciate the more creative items on the menu. The grilled romaine was beautifully presented. But overall a lot of the things we tried were just mediocre. I really think this is because the menu is so ambitious, and could really benefit from fine tuning."}
{"text":"Soul \"I feel so hip right now\" Gastrolounge.  This is not a place for \"soul food,\" so don't let that portion of the name fool you.  It is the place to go for a WIDE variety of smaller, tapas style plates.  There is something here for the adventurous and the plainest of palates.    Plan to wait, upwards of 2 hours if you go on a weekend night.  I have pretty smart friends, so we came here at 7:30 on a Wednesday night and had nary a problem getting a table (with a 6 top).  We decided to order drinks at the bar while waiting on our last guest.  I was feeling crazy, and ordered a bloody mary (Absolut Peppar).  Bartender asked if I had ever tried a gin bloody mary.  I hadn't, and he gave me a sample.  I will stick to my vodka, but it was an awesome gesture. My liver says, \"thanks.\"  The food comes out as it is ready, so don't be shy to start eating if your friends haven't gotten their food yet.  Just dig in, people.  Per Nicole W's 5/5 review, I ordered the Shrimp Ceviche.  It was tasty, but I don't know that I'd order it again. The plantain chips were sweet and crunchy.  The perfect addition.  Cheese Plate- I feel sorry for vegans.  This was excellent.  My only qualm is that our server did not tell us what cheese was what, came from what kind of mammal, etc.   Lamb Lollipops-Fab.  I love these suckers, pun intended.  Dolmades-I am spoiled in this department and partial to Kabob's.    Rocket Antipasto- Great for sharing.  I could really taste the balsamic, which makes me happy.  I came here last summer I think it was and they had a hush puppy stuffed with warm pimiento cheese.  It was heaven.  Please bring those to the regular menu!!  Soul is a fun, tasty place!"}
{"text":"Went here on a first date on a Saturday night and it was completely packed. We were told that the wait would be an hour and 15 minutes and decided to wait it out and grab a drink downstairs at gallery 22 since they had an ipad and would text us when our table was ready. After over an hour and a half we went back upstairs to check on our table situation and there were multiple tables open outside. We asked them what was going on and they said that the could seat us right away. Once we were seated we were greeted in a timely manner by our waitress. The drink menu had some very interesting selections but none of the \"go to\" drinks that were easily identifiable. We ordered tapas and a sushi roll. The tapas were great but the sushi was very unremarkable. The service and overall atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"Here on a business trip. Had a wonderful meal. The crowd was really neat. I myself am married, but this would be a great place to go with your single girlfriends and meet a handsome lumberjack looking man haha. The tapas were amazing and I had the Brussels sprouts I could have imagined here"}
{"text":"Underwhelming at best. Was stoked to try this place out, as it came highly recommended. We showed up early and were seated right away (yay!). Our server was nice and explained the menu and made some recommendations. The cucumber mule, which they have on tap, was entirely too sweet and I ended up trading it in for a glass of prosecco. The brussel sprouts were tasty, but not anything special. The BBQ pork stuffed macaroni shells were a flavor combination that didn't work, the pork was too sweet, and the white cheddar cheese sauce had an odd texture, bordering on slimy. The Caesar salad was ok, but, due to their anything-goes coursing style, was the last dish we received. Again, nothing special. I would have tried more things, but was too disappointed to spend any more money for such mediocre small plates. Great concept, lovely space (although there is zero street signage and it's up a flight of stairs), but I was not impressed at all. Will not return."}
{"text":"Tapas. Sushi. Brussels sprouts. Enough said. Everything here is absolutely delicious! Service is always excellent and friendly and fun! Personally, I think this is some of the best sushi you can get in The surrounding Charlotte area and I feel it is overlooked a lot of times. The only down side are the hours, but don't we all wish they were opened more often. For all the Tinders' and Bumblers out there, this is first date friendly spot fa sho!"}
{"text":"Went here on my bday on Tuesday, all I can say it was pretty awesome, the lamb was so tasty I was one happy bday girl! It's more like a tapas joint, The music was pretty cool as well... I will definitely be checking this place out again."}
{"text":"Impressed - you betcha! This is a tapas food place, so great for a party of four splitting a bunch of different dishes, the pork belly with the watermelon is TO DIE FOR! (I literally think it melted in my mouth).  Drinks were also fabulous and a great atmosphere.  Parking can be tough, but if you're willing to pay $5.00 across the street, then you'll be good to go! :)"}
{"text":"Not many vegetable dishes but you don't come here for a healthy meal. The pork belly tacos topped with watermelon are a MUST. I don't usually like fruit with savory things but this was amazing. My two other favs were the lamb lollipops and the bread pudding with salted caramel ice cream. So so good."}
{"text":"The tapas and cocktails that they offer here are out of bounds! There's something for everyone on their menu and something new that you may have not tried before. My experience here was great for the most part with a little loop hole. Our waitress was nice at first, recommending certain things to us and explaining what tapas style food is. Once we ordered everything and we were ready for the check,  she seemed to be disappointed that we didn't order more. With that being said,  once we asked for the check, she seemed a bit awkward in a way that seemed rude. She was in a sense rushing us out of there because she cleared our table extremely fast and even took our water pitcher away. Not sure if it was my fianc√© and I, but we definitely got a weird vibe from her. Regardless, I will be back for another night out in the near future,"}
{"text":"Wish I could review the food because it smelled so good, but unfortunately we never got to try it. Came in to meet a few friends (5 of us total)- we were the first two there and the hostess wouldn't seat us until the whole party was there. I hate that rule, but I understand that many places have that in place. However, I explained that the others were parked and walking up but she wouldn't seat us and then gave up the only large booth to another group that came in after us. Frustrating but no big deal, I told her we didn't mind waiting. Then a table got up and left, leaving three 2-tops all in a row vacant. Hostess refused to let us sit there and put the tables together, even though we were the ONLY people waiting for a table. We asked a few times and she kept saying it was house rules not to seat those tables like that.  I have been a hostess, I appreciate the reasoning of having some general guidelines in place. However, to be that rigid to the point where it was almost laughable as we sat there in the small entryway staring at 6 open seats, was ridiculous. We left and had a bomb meal down the street at Midwood Smokehouse."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant, EVER. My fiancee and I will never leave Charlotte without having dinner and drinks here. We have gone on many different nights of the week. Although weeknights typically less crowded, there is usually always a bit of a wait (which is always worth it).   One of my favorite aspects of this place is their drink menu. I've lived in the tri-state area my whole life, so I have been spoiled by many speakeasy cocktail bars in New York City. My fiancee and I tried to find something comparable in Charlotte. It wasn't until we found Soul Gastrolounge that we found a place that offered invigorating cocktails that went beyond margaritas and manhattans. Their drink menu is always changing and they are tailored to the season.   Their menu is incredibly versatile. Following a tapas style menu, small plates range from salads, skewers, wings, tacos, and flatbreads to sushi, sashimi, sliders and paninis. You would think that with such variety, that it all couldn't be good. However, I have NEVER had something that I didn't like. A few unique specials are always offered, but the regular menu alone can keep you occupied. My favorites are the midwood mixed greens salad, chimichurri beef skewers, pork belly tacos, goat cheese and pesto flatbread, the Soul Roll, and Korean BBQ wings. We have been there several times and still haven't tried everything that we've wanted to. Don't forget to try their cupcake of day for dessert.   A DJ has always been spinning when we've gone. Following with the lounge theme, he plays subtle, but not typical or cheesy lounge music. It's enough to spark your interest without being overwhelming or distracting.   I HIGHLY recommend Soul Gastrolounge!"}
{"text":"Soul Gastrolounge!  This is probably one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. I've had my last two birthday dinners and countless other dinners here and I love the atmosphere and how diverse and eclectic the menu is. Greek-inspired, Middle Eastern, sushi, southern, there is something for everyone, for the most adventurous palates (Rocky Mountain Oysters) to not so adventurous palates (Soul Grilled Cheese). Since I've tried a variety of tapas here, I'll break them down into my top choices, ones worth trying, and ones that are just not good.  MY FAVORITES +Piquillo Peppers on Bruschetta: These taste like mini pizzas! A little difficult to eat but I love the flavors here. I usually get 2 orders and if I have to share, I'll get an additional order. The tomatoes are marinated well and the bread is super crispy. I'll get these EVERY SINGLE TIME. +Godzilla Roll: Not a sushi fan, but this is the best sushi of my life. I don't like the regular sauces it comes with (mayo, eel sauce, & sweet and sour) so I get this with sweet chili sauce instead! A little heavy on the cream cheese but still so so good. +Falafel Pita: I don't like tomatoes in this so I ask them to put tiny pickles instead. Extra tzatziki doesn't hurt either! +Truffle Fries: Hot, crispy, flavored with garlic, truffle oil, and pecorino cheese. Basically amazing. +Banana Phyllo Turnovers: A sweet way to end a delicious meal. I might ask for more ice cream next time.  WORTH TRYING +Fried Goat Cheese on Bruschetta: One of my friend's favorites! I prefer the Piquillo Peppers though, cause these are a bit blander than the peppers. Easier to eat though. +Flatbread: With pistachio pesto, truffle whipped goat cheese, honey-braised garlic, and arugula. A little sticky and messy and although I dislike arugula, somehow this combination works. Not something I'd order every time though. +Sashimi Tuna Tacos: While I'm not a fan of most of the components in this (sashimi, tuna, & mayo), every time we're here, this is a must-get item for LA. +Fried Brussels Sprouts: Smells horrible but tastes pretty good. Vegetarians, they cannot leave the bacon off of this. +Daily Specials: Most of the time the daily specials are not vegetarian-friendly so I usually stay away from them. A few months ago, they actually had a vegan special that I tried. It was Linguine with Chanterelle Mushroom & Porcini Cream with Sliced Honey Truffles. Kinda bland but I took it home and after I added a little Sriracha to it.. A++. +Chocolate Brioche Bread Pudding: So I didn't actually order this, it was a little surprise they brought out for my birthday last year and it was really good! Tasted like a delicious, warm brownie.  SKIP! +Ahi Tuna Skewers: Ok this goes back to my disdain for tuna in general but I wanted to try something different one time and I did not like this at all. I asked for the tuna to be cooked really well done but apparently it was a request they could not do and the tuna was still red in the middle when I got it. Had they cooked it to my liking, this could have ended up in the \"worth trying\" list. +Anchovy Fries: Nothing special about these.. Breading has no flavor and I don't like the sauce it comes with. +Grilled Caesar: I found the concept to be intriguing but the execution wasn't there for me. It was difficult to eat and there was an extremely heavy anchovy flavor in the dressing. +Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos: Seriously this is their best seller?! LA and I found it to be all hype. The pork belly and the watermelon were ok separately I guess but together? YUCK. I hated the texture and flavor of everything together. The soggy flour tortilla was useless too. I know I'm in the minority here but if it's not good, I'm not going to lie and say that it is.  OTHER TAPAS I'VE TRIED (1-5 star rating) Eggplant Parmesan Skewers (****) Babaganoush (****) Spicy Feta Dip (***) Chimichurri Beef Skewers (***) Soul Grilled Cheese (***) Spanakopita (***) Dirty South Nachos (***)  MY TO TRY LIST (for the future) Salmon-o-pita, Saganaki, Ki Roll (vegan sushi!), Hamachi with Jalape√±o, Eel Roll, Guacamole Stack, Country Greek Salad, Midwood Mixed Greens, Taramosalata, Marinated Spanish White Anchovies on Bruschetta, Cupcake of the Day  The seasonal cocktails are interesting and worth trying. Some of them are like wtf (in size and/or taste) but others can be really good. Servers are friendly and it's nice that some of them remember me even if several months go by in between my visits.  Yes there might be a long wait. This place is tiny and popular. I usually get here after peak times so I've never waited more than 30-45 minutes. Just download the Nowait app. If I have to wait, I'll just walk over to the Common Market (about 5 min walk) and grab a beer or a small snack. Pay attention to your phone though! I think they hold your table for 5-10 minutes once they send you a text that it's ready.  Thanks to anyone who read my novel.  Looking forward to my next visit to Soul!!"}
{"text":"Easy to miss the staircase entrance to this fun tapas style joint. Enjoyed sitting outside with view of uptown and grazing tapas style. Wife loved drink special, which was a ginger infused vodka concoction whose name escapes me. Food was not particularly memorable. Cost $70, $65 minus cocktail for four. Those tapas add up! Good service and food came out promptly. Better for drinks and light eating than dinner."}
{"text":"It's a place to be seen. It's small..really really small...like a restaurant for ants...it's the cool/hip place to go. They don't take reservations so either go early or go late...if you go in between don't say I didn't warn you b/c you will wait and wait....and wait some more..only to be sat 6 inches from the next table. (Go downstairs to 22 and have a beer while you wait) Food is pretty good...service has always been awesome. It's a tad pricey but it's tapas....and it's the place to be seen..don't forget that. The last 2 times I ate there, I ate the sushi and it did NOT like me at all 6 hrs later so I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The food is always amazing! I always get the pork belly tacos, goat cheese bruschetta, soul crunch roll and brussel sprouts! I wash this goodness down with a brut cava. The wait and be ridiculous and up to 2 hours on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday. It's so worth it tho! Just grab a drink and enjoy the views of uptown while you wait."}
{"text":"Soul is an incredible experience! We went there on a double date and ordered a wide variety of food to share. I didn't try anything I didn't like. It is a great place for a special date night or a group outing. It wasn't overly noisy and our waiter was great! This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Love the pork belly and duck tacos!! It doesn't take reservations but can use Nowait app to line up in advance. Def recommend this restaurant for a night with friends."}
{"text":"Feel like you are being let in on a secret when you sit in the comfy chairs and try dish after dish of things you can't get enough of.  Think I'm exaggerating? I'm not ;)   This is haute cuisine served casually as if it were effortless. Combine this with excellent service a cozy loft atmosphere and you have found heaven!"}
{"text":"Finally made it into the ever elusive Soul. Our server was really helpful and found a new favorite bourbon that my fiance loved. We had a great tasting: pork belly & watermelon tacos, Dirty South Nachos,  lamb lollipops and finished with Thai Iced Tea Ice cream. I would recommend all of them and the Dirty South Nachos are like a dream - planning to recreate at home but a trip back to Charlotte might be in order!  Just a tip for the hosting station: your goal should be  to organize and welcome spending guests, not give such a cold attitude that people think twice about enduring the crazy wait. There is a way to greet and treat people that conveys this goal. Thankfully the food paid off. Take it from someone who has happily waited hours for Toki Underground, you can make or break someone's experience literally right from the door."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to check this place out for a while and so glad I finally did! Awesome service...sat at the bar...the curry lamb skewers with mango chutney was to die for and surprising the sushi was amazing as well. Got a cupcake to top the night off and it sadly was no good...lacked flavor but overall I would definitely go ahead!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best place to take a date in Charlotte! It's exclusive so you will have to wait but it's worth it. First, the lamp chop lollipops are\"The Bomb\". Seasoned to perfection!! Next the grilled Cesar salad with that killer dressing!!yummmy!!!! And the pork belly with the watermelon cubes...genius!! If you haven't been...you're missing out!! Check them out on Central Ave!!"}
{"text":"I'm a big sushi lover, and I had the best roll of my life here. It's the bottom roll in the picture, I wish I remembered what it was called! Another favorite was the ahi tuna tacos. Everything we ordered was great though. Service and location were amazing as well"}
{"text":"Went here when visiting the city of Charlotte from DC, and just had to post a rave review about it.  Everything from the ambiance to the music really set the tone of the mood-posh, yet chill, with slightly romantic undertones.  The menu seemed like it was designed around those exact themes, as there were many classic items on the menu such as, stuffed shells or short ribs with a twist on them. Except these items were smaller, and meant to be shared with company.  I enjoyed the short ribs as well another pork tacos and they were both equally delicious.  As I ate my meal, Two patrons beside me said that they frequented the restaurant and they loved everything on the menu. This was an automatic cue for my return! What a pleasure to dine here."}
{"text":"Huxley and I tuckered in, situating ourselves cross-splayed at one of the dark-wood tables lining the near wall of Soul's narrow upstairs veranda. She slowly lowered her sunglasses and thumbed back a wayward strand of her salted, birch-blond bangs. She squinted to the morning light diffusing in through the muddled plastic of the zipper-tent enclosing the balcony. \"It's a such a gorgeous day,\" she said. \"It stings.\" I nodded. It was a spectacular February morning, bright, clean and full up with that heavy brisk that forms in the hours just before the cold air of lingering night completely gives way to the warm mug of day. I ran my hands across my face. I looked up to Hux's squinted eyes, her splotchy cheeks, her ragged clumps of unwashed hair. We shared a commiserating smile.  Presently, our waitress approached - a rangy sprite, narrow and straight, with a black bob, olive skin, and the most adorable pair of black-framed lenses perched atop her strong nose. Quintessential midwood mistress, quirky and divine.  She absconded to fetch our coffee, and Hux and I reflected: Soul is two restaurants in one. At night, it's a swarming lounge, swollen with music and laughter and flavor and abated light. Tapas dance cruel and sushi rolls mean and the pork-belly tacos punch you right in the gut. But for me, it's the drinks, dear god, the Basil Smashes and the red red wines, they flow so fast and so readily, and it's impossible not to, in an instant, drink yourself drunk. Soul, at night, is not a restaurant to be dined casually. It's a force to reckon; it's a bright hot swill. And if you let it, it'll always take you where you want to be. But then there's that other Soul. That once a week daylight binge, the Sunday brunch, the counterpoint to your drunk drunk nights. Haggard with heads low and eyes tight and feet ashuffle, skittering down the cracked sidewalk, all the denizens of the late-night world awake and wander together, inexorably drawn here, to this place, this dazzling place, that opens itself up to us in its most vulnerable hours to feed our faces with the most glorious menu of hang-over spurnables your wasted mind could imagine.  Our waitress returned with our coffee and cream. I delighted. Huxley ordered the scrambled egg pierogies; I went with the shrimp and grits.  We sipped our brew, strong, warm and rich, for a bit, until, in too little time, our waitress returned. \"So...\" she began, \"the kitchen is a little out of sorts this morning...  we're out of pierogies.\"  \"That's fine,\" Hux said, so sweet and demure. \"I'll have the mac and cheese.\" We soaked up the warming air and forced our eyes to let in a little more of the morning light. I turned sideways in my chair and leaned my head and shoulders back against the brick wall. I looked up and admired the amber light seeping from the antique sconces stationing the upper perimeter. \"I love this place,\" Huxley said, gazing dream-faced out into the steadily enlivening miasma of Central ave.  I smiled. \"Me too.\"  \"Can we order mimosas?\" I glanced down at my watch; it was ten to noon. \"Nope, not yet.\"  Our waitress returned with our plates: I was presented with a magnificently arranged tray set upon with fried building blocks of sweet southern grits, smothered in shrimp and andouille and a spicy cream; Hux was handed a messy little cast-iron bowl of corkscrew macaroni drenched in hot white cheddar and topped with bacon and chive, and it was all the best and worst things she or I could desire.  Our hearts swelled and our throats filled up and we salivated like wild, unfettered things. Without care or consideration, we devoured. Savory delights not fit for any creatures such as ourselves, not on that morning, not after that night, but that's what Soul brunch is... that's what it does. It fixes you, it heals you, it restores in you whatever semblances and sensibilities the previous night had taken away. It fills you full, deep and complete, with exactly what you need.  The waitress returned, two tall cylinders of nectar in hand, and placed them on the table. \"Sorry about the pierogies,\" she said. \"These are on the house.\"  I gaped, I gawked, I mooned those two glasses. Juice and champagne, a marriage of substances not easily rivaled, the crowning gesture of an exceptional morning. \"Mimosas...\" I said in a slur. I let the sound roll round my mouth and spill purposefully from my lips. \"Mimosas.\" I spit and I toiled and let myself get all riled up with it. \"Mimosas!\"  Hux reached out and put her hand on my wrist. \"Calm down.\"  I grinned, a jackal, and threw back half my glass, the bubbly sweet and acid all so perfect together, so perfect in my mouth. I looked down at Hux, that girl, that vision, her and all her colors, opaline and prismatic, that oval face, the curves of those crazy lips, and that hair there just dancin', blowin'. \"No, you calm down,\" I said to her.  The quirky waitress got a really good tip."}
{"text":"So went here the other day with a friend of mine. They were packed as always, but we were promptly seated at a patio table, which is great because they have a beautiful view! Our server was AWESOME! Very friendly and knowledgable.  My girlfriend ordered a couple of sushi rolls and I ordered the shells and cheese small plate.  Her food showed up almost twenty minutes before mine...but I know mine takes a bit longer, I guess they just didn't time it out well.  When my food finally comes I try to cut into it with my knife and couldn't (it's pasta...), it was severely over cooked.  I let the server know and he said he'd be happy to bring me another one. Fifteen minutes later a manager comes to the table and tells me that he's sorry I didn't like the dish, but after speaking to the chef, it was not cooked improperly, but that it was supposed to be like that (something I found interesting, since I get that same thing every time I go there, and not once was the pasta so hard that I couldn't cut through it with a knife...). He then told me that he preferred not to bring me that same dish, since I \"don't like how they prepare it.\" He insisted I pick a different item instead of the one I wanted, saying also that if I still insisted on the dish I ordered, that it would take another 20 min.  In the end I went with something completely different, the tuna tacos. They were good, but not what I wanted. It was also really frustrating that it took over 45 minutes from the time that I first ordered before I was actually able to eat... The manager was nice enough to take care of my food, but after my food being severely over cooked, the manager trying to play it off as if that's how it's supposed to be cooked, and then telling me he wasn't going to bring me what I ordered and instead pressuring me to pick something else...don't think I'm going to go back here."}
{"text":"Soul Is a few blocks from my 3rdW pied-a-terre and from the week they opened became my funky, friendly, foodie oasis.The decor, done by Scott Weaver, is high design kitsch, with the dormant color the perfect shade of teal blue and stuffed peacock to boot! The booths are claustrophobic to me but \"cozy\" to some. I am normally found on my \"Lola\" stool at the main bar. If you want a quiet dining experience get there as close to 5:30 as you can...after 7 it's a scene with hip 'hoodies and loud girls from Ballantyne. My \"guys\" bartenders Brian, Johnny, Adam, and Bob keep me well hydrated and fed.  Whether by myself or with friends I like \"small\" dishes, tapas grazing. The menu is vast and varied but after 2 years needs a makeover. The specials by chef Jay and John  are the way to go. Last week a salad served like sushi roll, consisting of an heirloom tomato wedge, wrapped in cucumber, bathed in red wine vinegar with a dash of bacon oil had me doing the \"Harry Met Sally\" groans."}
{"text":"Love this place, amazing food! Everything on the menu is great. The atmosphere is very cool, and the staff is always very nice. One of the best places in Charlotte. Yes, the fish tacos are to die for."}
{"text":"The long wait was well worth it. Located in plaza midwood, with a great sunset view of the city skyline. Great assortment of tapas. I highly recommend the pork belly tacos with watermelon. Sounds like an odd flavor combination but was my group's favorite hands down!"}
{"text":"Exquisite! I've never had anything from this place that wasn't amazing. Service is always amazing and the food is seasoned to a T! Their shrimp ceviche is out of this world. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Always a win in my book. Some really unique dishes and everything is small plated so it's nice to have a variety of orders.   The pork belly and watermelon tacos are by far one of the best dishes in this area. Be warned though this place is NOT cheap. With drinks and a a few different plates your going to be paging but it is worth it.   The brunch on Sunday mornings is to die for as well. The whole menu in the morning you can't miss on. The service is always good though you may have to wait for a table if it's peak hours. Atmosphere is also very nice and low key. Great date place!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of four on Thanksgiving eve without a reservation and the place was packed, both inside and outside on the patio.  We left our name with the hostess and went to the bar, which was also full, so we stood around with others while we waited to be seated.  The whole time while standing at the bar, we noticed an empty table for four, perfect for us.  After about 15-20 minutes, we were seated at this very table.  Wonder what took them so long.  Soul offers a variety of tapas and sushi and we ordered several items including: the crunch roll, goat cheese toasts, yellowtail roll, hamachi roll, chicken skewers, Asian wings, sashimi tuna tacos, little neck clams, sticky veal shortribs, and Mediterranean wings.  Everything was excellent.  The fish used in each of the sushi plates was fresh and delicious.  The sashimi tuna tacos are really fragile, though and pretty much break when you try to pick them up.  Each tapas or sushi dish runs about $7-8.  The inside of the restaurant is dark, stylish, trendy, etc.  Candle-lit tables, comfy booths and chairs, nice atmosphere, and a good spot to take a date.  In fact, one of the people I ate with like it so much, he decided to take his date here the following Saturday.  Additional notes: water here is optionally served with a slice of cucumber, the bathrooms are unisex, you have to walk up/down a set of stairs outside of the building to get in/out of the restaurant, and service was good."}
{"text":"Meh, coming from the NY area not sure what the hype is all about.  Long lines, service OK, but most importantly the food was nothing to write home about.  I think there are much better restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday and it did not disappoint. The fried chicken skin nachos were soooo delicious that we ordered two and do yourself a favor and try the pickled okra that comes as a garnish. Simply fabulous! The veal, pork belly mac n cheese, steak and chimichurri, lamb were all delicious. We did not care for the fried meatballs (a bit dry and flavorless) or the saganaki (it was very unpleasant). Our waitress Allison was awesome. Good food. Good company. Good service. It was a fantastic Saturday night!"}
{"text":"Let's see....pork belly tacos, fried Brussel sprouts, dirty south nachos, the flat bread, are all amazing & a must try!! I've had better bone marrow & the Rocky Mountain oysters would be better with a better dipping sauce...maybe a lemon based aioli. The drinks are fun also & with cocktails on tap you just can't beat the fun ideas presented here! It's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites Charlotte!  Whether it's a Saturday night or a Wednesday Happy Hour, the food is always amazing and the drinks always cold.  Try the Soul Roll and the Pork Belly Tacos- neither will disappoint."}
{"text":"Fun girls night. We tried so many small plates and all were tasty! I also enjoyed my cucumber mule, which they have on tap. While there are no reservations, we arrived early, got our name in and were seated in about 30 minutes. It's definitely a later crowd, standing room only when we left. Only draw back service was a little spotty."}
{"text":"Went with a group. A longer than desired wait time. Drinks were great. Got the cheesy shells with pork belly bbq inside. Best thing Ive eaten in a very long time!  Will definately be back!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in Charlotte, if you go on the weekends the waiting list could be 1+ hours.  All food is great and there are many options in the menu. The atmosphere with the DJ and nice decoration makes it a very funky place."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 4. I love places that serve tapas generally because the food isn't boring and that's exactly why I love this place!   There is a great variety of things on the menu. These tapas are pretty pricey, but if you want to treat yourself once in a while, then go for it. Everyone usually suggests the pork belly tacos. Pork belly is getting more and more common these days, but they use a watermelon salsa and surprisingly...it's awesome. I also recommend the sashimi tuna tacos and the veal short ribs. They were all pretty worth it.   **I think the lamb lollipops are NOT worth it. It's one of the more pricier options on the menu and there's nothing that special about them. The lamb lollipops at Davidson St. Public House are better in my opinion.  Besides the food, I love the environment of this place. Great place to meet up and grab drinks after work or late at night. There's usually always a wait though so that's a downside.  note: Kitchen isn't opened til closing time."}
{"text":"Me and my wife's favorite after hours bar in Charlotte. And even though we've always had dinner before coming to Soul, we somehow always seem to manage saving just enough room for some delicious food and drinks. Our favorites are the Replay roll and Pork Souvlaki skewers. Also, don't expect to get right in on the weekend as it gets crowded inside but squeeze by people at the bar and grab a drink. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Always have a great time here! Great food, great vibe, just all around good time! But what can you expect from Greeks :-) I can honestly say though the only thing I have not tried is the sushi. I have heard good things about it just have not had it myself. It really is just the way I enjoy eating with friends and just snacking on so many different plates, just like home.  My only complaint would have to be that it just gets so packed, but hey that can also be a good thing!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, but portions were small.  Great fun atmosphere, but it got really loud as the place packed out.  Not sure i would go back."}
{"text":"I was very lucky to find this on yelp.  However I did not know it was upstairs so I did look like a fool as I walked around for a bit.    The bar saved me from a long wait!  The food was expertly executed. The beer knowledge was above expectations and I hope to have the chance to go back."}
{"text":"We had an unexpected add to our party was rudely told that we couldn't have 9 at the table and they had to leave. Never ever again will I go back to soul. Hostess was rude, server was rude, manager was rude."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. Food is delicious. You can go here when you're in the mood for sushi, meats or cheeses. Suits a lot of different tastes.   Be forewarned it's served tapas style, meaning food comes out when it's ready. This only ever bothered me once when more food came out than could fit on the table...like, at least try to plan it out!   When you go, try to get a table rather than a booth. The booths, unfortunately, are tall, cutting off your view of the restaurant and killing the ambiance. I want to chop the tops off! If the weather permits, sitting outside gets you a killer view of the city."}
{"text":"Had 6 of us. All filled to the max for under $25 a person. Great food, well executed and a wide variety. Servers not the best. But the food is worth it"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place after hearing all of the hoopla about it. If I could rate the ambiance alone I would have definitely given it 5 stars. The food is really just quite average and was unimpressed with everything that I tried. The pork belly tacos seem to be a favorite of the majority of reviewers. I thought the flavors of the pork belly with the chunks of watermelon was really just a muddy mess of flavors in my mouth. The sushi was just fair. I have had much fresher sushi and sashimi from other places in the Charlotte area. Frankly I've given this a rating of 2 stars for an average over the ambience of 5 stars and the decent tasting brussel sprouts and edamame. This place is just overpriced and over rated however if you're looking for a romantic type of ambiance for decent cocktails alone I highly recommend it ."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite in charlotte. They have great food and the service is really good. Everyone should try the watermelon tacos and their sushi."}
{"text":"Long wait, a lot of uncomfortable seating, crowded, loud, dark dining room, hit or miss service......but the food....the food.  I am in love with the food here.   The drinks are pricey..tasty...but expensive for what you are getting.  All in all it seems like my review is pretty negative.  BUT--I'm serious, the food is worth it.  I will wait in that line and put up with whatever to get some pork belly tacos.  Most everything on the menu is good, a few exceptions to that rule (meatballs, steak & egg, some of the sushi) but for the most part, the dishes are creative and delicious.   Use the no wait app to put yourself in line and eliminate your wait.  It's way worth it it.  The patio is cold in the winter, the heaters do help some, though.  Hot in the summer...deal with & sweat away while sipping your crafty wallet cinching cocktail!!!! But please, make sure you get the pork belly tacos!!! Did I mention they are my fav??!!"}
{"text":"Share meals tapas style. Bring a date or a group and check this spot out. Seating is limited and no reservations all for a reason. This is a must try in clt."}
{"text":"Incredible food. Service is hit or miss.  Hostess was pretty rude which obviously didn't set the tone for the evening right. The atmosphere here is unique, but never come here hungry or in a hurry. Even with open tables you will have to wait. I'd suggest making a reservation.  Bottom line, there are too many great places to eat in Charlotte to make me hurry back to a place where the 1st person that greets you is unpleasant."}
{"text":"I was here this past Monday night and must say I was truly impressed. This place is really laid back. The wait staff was nice and the DJ was awesome. This place is definitely going to be a regular spot for me now. It seems to be a good intimate place for you to hang with friends or that special someone. I only had drinks this first time, but the tapas plates I saw around the room looked really great. The menu looks diverse and I'll be eating for sure the next time I come by."}
{"text":"I still suffer from that \"want to hate this place\" thing, because seriously, how many Forever 21 tank-dresses and half-finished brand new trad sleeves can I handle seeing in one night? But I'm making an effort, here, to see past the fringe-fratty crowd that fills this place, because it's trying to be good and carve a niche for itself in a nabe that doesn't take to Fancy Tapas Pants. And who doesn't like good beer and well-paired nibbles.  It's odd to me how extreme the differences in service and quality can be on any given night. Even from the same server, the same night, the next week. And that's rough - I have no idea what to expect when I walk in (and like I said in my last review - the prices here are above average, for moi, anyways, so I have some expectations). Sometimes, it takes 20 minutes just to get a glass of water - others, as soon as you sit, you've got menus, a nibble, agua, todos.   So when you're hungry, and need a beer, please, peering around the way-too-tall booth backs can get annoying, quick. If you've got claustraphobic pals, sit at the bar.   The music improves on off nights - they have DJs that don't care as much about crowd-pleasing as they do about, say, a history lesson in 70s Soul or Surf. Getting an education in Sly while eating Manchego and toasties, while sipping a Xingu or Manhattan, yup, that's about as good as it gets.   So yeah, Soul, I don't know what to do with ya. I want to come hang out, often, but the hassle-factors keep me away. So I guess we'll keep our relationship casual. No, I'll call you."}
{"text":"The only bad thing about this place is how small it is. The food is outstanding and the drinks even better. Absolute excellent service. Go early or you won't get a table. The pork belly tacos are what they are known for and for good reason. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I love the atmosphere! The pork belly tacos are amazing! Plan to wait! I mean really plan to wait to get in. Three hours of waiting and we finally were seated! Make sure to download the no wait app to secure a spot in line."}
{"text":"Still not impressed. I came here a long time ago and wasn't a fan. I returned for a friend's birthday dinner and looked forward to giving Soul Gastro another chance. I had the gyro which was lamb and beef mixed on a stick. It came with three pieces and yogurt. It smelled like faint poop and didn't taste well seasoned. Just not a great thing. I also had Brussel's sprouts. They were well seasoned and cooked correctly. The birthday girl had an orange cupcake that we all tasted. No one like the cupcake. Lastly, our server kind of rushed us throughout the entire dinner. Middle of the road friendly. It just wasn't a great experience. I will say that the Korean BBQ wings were good and that's what I would recommend to anyone visiting."}
{"text":"Best tapas in charlotte & the drinks are to die for. Great place to meet up with friends, clients, or cozy date night. We love Soul Gastrolounge!"}
{"text":"Soul is, hands-down, my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. It's a delicious spot, with a funky vibe, and always makes for a great date night (or just food adventure)!   There are so many staples on their menu that you want to order again and again, but you also want to make room to try some new items as well! Some of my favorite include the pork belly tacos, the lamb lollipops, any of their sushi and their chocolate bread pudding! The bone marrow is also melt-in-your-mouth delicious, and they'll let you take the bone home as a dog treat as well! The Rocky Mountain oysters are something that only sounds intimidating, but in reality, they are perfectly breaded and fried, very similar in taste and texture to a fried oyster. Even writing a review about their food makes me want to make my next reservation now!   There is always a wait for this place, but trust me, it is completely worth it. It also brings out something else I love, the fact that even though there is a wait, the servers never rush you, and you really get to enjoy your time and savor all the food!"}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE!!!!!  Pork-belly tacos   YUM!!!  I will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"One of the Charlotte favorites. You can't go wrong bringing out of town guests here, there is something for everyone. They menu is huge and I've never had anything that didn't get eaten up! Some favorites are the pork belly tacos (obviously), the stuffed shells and the hummus. Prepare for a wait but worth it."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour to check out the pork belly tacos with watermelon salsa. The pieces were huge and the watermelon was sliced in cubes and seemed to have been drenched in vinegar. Wasn't a fan of the slicing and presentation. I did love the flavor of the pork belly but it could have been cooked a little longer for some melt in your mouth kind of meat.   Place was upstairs, parking is on the street, ambiance was nice."}
{"text":"Is it ok if I say that this is my favorite place in Charlotte? Well...non-Asian place that is ;) You enter the room and you are transported to a chic restaurant in a hip city such as New York or LA! There is absolutely NOTHING on the menu that is less that awesome. I personally love the truffle fries, Napoleon sushi roll, wings, skewers,etc, etc. Yum! They also have a cool selection of beers, wine, and cocktails that are worth trying. If you're looking for a fun, vibrant, place where you'll also meet cool new people and eat scrumptious food, come to Soul!!"}
{"text":"Fun place for a late meal and drink. Can sit outside or inside upstairs and the music is a nice feel!"}
{"text":"I was passing through from Charleston, WV to Savanah, GA for a wedding. The tapas canned out very quickly and the drinks were amazing. The atmosphere and music were a hit with my fianc√© and sister. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Food was ok.  Service was terrible....this includes the hostess and waitress!  The manager is the only person who tried to accommodate us for getting a table.  They weren't very patient or understanding when asking about menu items.  Chicken and waffles was just ok, the waffle was better than the chicken.  Just an FYI...Out of all their brunch menu items, they do not do egg whites."}
{"text":"First time at Soul on Monday and was impressed! They had a good selection of food on their menu. Something for everyone. I wouldn't recommend coming here on an empty stomach as waits are pretty lengthy (we waited over an hour after being quoted a 45 min wait for 5 people) and since it is a tapas place, plates are generally small and you could rack up a pretty big bill.   I ordered:  Chimichurri beef skewers : They come with 3 small skewers with about 4 pieces of meat on them along with the chimichurri sauce. The sauce is full of flavor and rich! You'll want to drown your beef in it.   Sashimi Tuna Tacos : 3 to a plate. Burst of flavors, I tell ya! Tuna was def fresh and the marinated cucumber adds such a great taste to it.  Pork Belly Tacos : A little disappointed that they only come with 2 a plate (for $12/plate -_-) but man, that pork belly is AMAZING! I can see why it's such a hit there. Although, I wasn't a fan of the \"watermelon salsa\" because of the slightly pickled taste, I absolutely loved it. The glaze on the pork belly is to die for. So sweet and delicious!  Korean BBQ Wings: Talk about a kick to the friggin' face! I was really surprised how spicy the wings were after taking a lick of the sauce. After you get through that first taste, these wings are delicious! They had a slight taste of gochujang, korean hot pepper paste (hence: korean bbq), which is probably what gives it such a kick. This was definitely my favorite plate!  Sushi was just above average, but not that impressive.   Unfortunately, they ran out of the dessert we wanted (their bread pudding) so I can't speak too much on that behalf except that I was just sad that I was not able to try it :(   Aside from being misquoted a wait time, the ambiance of the restaurant is perfect for a chill night out, service is good and food is definitely something to try. Can't wait to go back and try more items off the menu!"}
{"text":"Great food, but service was ok. The bartender was a little rude and the kitchen closed earlier than scheduled. I would go back and give it another try for the food and ambiance though!"}
{"text":"Pros: -Great vibe -Cool bar menu -Great food  Cons: -Expensive -Left hungry (all small plates)  -Pretentious and rude staff -Long long long wait  I don't really understand what all the hype is about. The food was good, but I'm not sure if it was worth another go."}
{"text":"Soul is one of my favorite restaurants in all of Charlotte. They have the best truffle fries, tuna sashimi tacos, and sushi!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Cool place. This place is hoppin!! I hate to admit it, but its definitely for the younger crowd, but my old ass will be going back!! They don't take reservations, but they suggest you use the \"NoWait\" app to keep a place in line until your table is ready. Pretty cool. We had a drink at the bar while we waited and the got our table soon after. Drinks were good but pricey. Our waiter was awesome and knowledgeable and gave us great suggestions. I've been dying for Pork Belly Tacos and they were delicious, but I kinda feel like the taco part goes to waste, because all I ate was the pork belly and watermelon. Tender, juicy little nice size bites of sweet, unctuous pork with a piece of cool, sweet watermelon. Yum fuckin O!! We also had the Cheese platter with apricot preserves and toast points. Nice portions of Blue, Goat, Manchego, and Boucheron.  So good. Had to ask for more toast points, we ran out. We also ordered a sushi called the Dragon Roll. It was some kind of fish, tempura shrimp, cream cheese. and the fish was fresh, flavor was on point, so FN good!!!. My dessert was the Chocolate Brioche with Vanilla Ice cream swimming in what tasted like the best chocolate milk you ever had. I couldnt finish it, but I will next time. Go early or use the app. I can't wait to try all the other stuff. I'm getting hungry again!! Fill your belly and warm your soul here. The wait will be worth it!"}
{"text":"My friends and I had such a fun dinner at soul.  Between 4 people we split 5 plates plus 2 desserts. This we the perfect amount of food and each plate was so yummy. Our waiter was excellent and so helpful explaining the menu. My favorite was the goat cheese bruschetta. Very  fun atmosphere for date night, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Brilliant. Desireable. Damn you Soul....you can do no wrong."}
{"text":"The place has a great vibe, with a good cross-section of people. We were there mid-week, and got a great big table for four right away. The menu has at least 2 somethings for everyone, and we ate well. The drinks we're great, too, and the service was laid back but didn't miss much."}
{"text":"A MUST try!   Overall great place for tapas style dining! Be prepared for a wait, especially on weekends and parties larger than 4. Everything I've tried on the menu is amazing!   Their sushi rolls are my favorite! Many people suggest the pork tacos with watermelon. (I've never tried them simply because I don't care for watermelon.) Cocktails and cupcakes of the day are a major it as well!"}
{"text":"Maybe I don't get out as much as I used to since we had kids, maybe it was the prospect of a well-deserved and overdue date night with the wife, but this was one of the top 10 meals of my life.  Pork belly tacos, ahi tuna skewers, beef chimichurri skewers, korean BBQ wings were all amazing. My wife loved the tuna sashimi tacos as well. Showed up around 7:00 PM on Saturday night and had to wait a reasonable 30 minutes because we wanted to sit inside and it was well worth it. The ambiance inside is great for date night, can easily hear your companion but its not definitely buzzing in there so you don't feel bad laughing and having a good time.  Would highly recommend this place. I think 4 people would probably be the max i would bring considering there aren't that many tables unless you're willing to wait a while, the place doesn't take reservations. Owner told us this place gets really busy around 8:30 PM on Saturday, so would try and get there early in the night if you can. He also told us you can call and put your name down on the list when you're on the way..  My wife and I LOVED this place and hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome. Drinks awesome. Atmosphere awesome- very dark and meaningful. Service is good, a touch slower; is that Euro style?  We sat outside and great locale. Lots of smokers but doesn't bother us. Cocktails are killer. Pricey but worth it. Love this place. Sunday is great night to go, no wait. It still was bumping though."}
{"text":"Let's get the biggest negative out of the way - the wait here is atrocious. We went on a Thursday night and the wait was over an hour and a half. Okay. Now let's move on.  Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. And yum, again. Everything we had here was wonderful. For drinks, my fella had the Cucumber Mule and described it as \"super refreshing\". I can't remember the name of my cocktail but it was really good. For meals, we had the dirty south nachos and korean wings (both for him) and the brie bruschetta and red dragon roll (for me). We both enjoyed everything! My favorite was the red dragon roll and I will probably order that every time.   Great spot. So bring a fully charged phone to keep you occupied while you wait (unless the person you are with is someone you've been dating for a few months or less - in that case, talk to them and DON'T mess with your phone) and enjoy :)"}
{"text":"* This is my takeout experience from December 2013.  no. no no no no no.  Our group ordered about $120 worth of food. A large enough variety to get a good idea of the food here. We were really excited but very very quickly disappointed as we dug in. Overall the food wasn't cooked, portioned, or seasoned appropriately. A gastro-anything should not fail in these basic aspects! I think if we actually dined in I might be able to give it a 2-star rating to account for freshness and what not, but quite frankly I'm glad I experienced the dulled tastes of our very disappointing food.  the gist: * pork belly/watermelon tacos: overcooked and dried out pork belly (FAIL), mushy watermelon (YUCK) * nachos: unbelievably excessive grease (even for chicken skin) * lamp lollipops: bland and dry * wings: not memorable, so likely not terrible offensive."}
{"text":"I don't get the 2+ hour wait?   The hostess isn't very nice. Had two encounters with her and she's just snobby.  Anyways, the food... Shared a bunch of stuff. The pork belly tacos, bone marrow, tzatziki dip, skewers with chimichurri, a sushi roll. All were okay but nothing super amazing. The skewers were a little bland.   Had the pistachio ice cream which was good but super melted when it came out.  Again, don't understand the hype. It was okay but don't think I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Stopped in on an early Saturday evening, shortly after they opened. Ate outside as it was a nice day. Food was amazing! Everything is served tapas style and we ordered 5 items in total which was enough for my wife and I. Cocktails were great and the food was very good. Some highlights were the Southern Fried Chicken Wings, Truffle Fries, Sushi, and Mushroom Sandwich. Will definitely go back, but the service was lacking. The waitress made several mistakes on our order and was not very attentive as we waited 10+ minutes before we ever even greeted. Perhaps this was due to us sitting outside, though we were seated by a hostess... The food comes out as it is finished and there were multiple servers that ultimately helped us out which helped the overall experience. Even though the service was lacking, the food more than compensated. If you are in Plaza Midwood, I would encourage you to stop in. Not exactly cheap, but worth it.  Very laid back, trendy, hipster-type of environment."}
{"text":"Super cute for couples. Some times can be a long wait.... Try the Mountain Oyster *side eye*"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Soul because of a recommendation. The food, atmosphere and service were all incredible!!"}
{"text":"Definitely my new spot to get sushi, I love this place!  Very trendy and located in Plaza-midwood Soul definitely sets itself apart.  My first impression was \"Ok I'm here.... where is it?\"  Well Its upstairs, above a skate shop / bar.  Walking up the stairs your first greeted with a metal catwalk type of area with outdoor seating, so of course this is where I sat.  Looking inside,  the Lounge looked very hip and trendy.  What I really like about it was the fact that music was not blasting, and you'd actually be able to have a conversation.  Food:  Rocks.  I had a sushi roll, can't recall the name, but it was great and huge.  The nigiri and sashimi I had were by FAR the largest I've ever had and best tasting.  As a big fan of eal I of course had that, simply amazing.  Two pieces was the size of a typical sushi roll somewhere else.  Had a few other dishes and they were all delish, hands down try this place!"}
{"text":"My friends and I met for drinks and date night with our hubbies. It was my first time, I loved the vibe and atmosphere! Our drinks were on point and music was great! Then the food came, everything was shared and very tasty! My only regret was not ordering more food before the kitchen closed. Oh well, next time!"}
{"text":"Food and service were excellent! This isn't where I would recommend for sushi but the other side of the menu is superb. Pork belly tacos are a must. Fried brussel sprouts are solid but not really special; they are the rage everywhere now. Shells and cheese are good and gooey...warning: they are super rich. Dirty south nachos were not really our thing-a little weird. The southern fried wings are also tasty."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were awesome. The pork belly tacos are the truth!!!! I'll be back! Funky atmosphere, definitely a foodie spot. Make sure to have your entire party with you for seating otherwise you'll have to wait. It's first come/first serve. Be patient as you will have a wait once you order but it's beyond worth it."}
{"text":"Inventive, expertly mixed craft cocktails, eclectic small plates, and a hip (but not pretentiously so) atmosphere make Soul Gastrolounge tops in our book. It actually has a bit of a West Asheville feel now that I think about it...  Anyways, you will be a better person for ordering the Pork Belly Tacos and the Pan Con Tomate--how DO you whip manchego cheese?!?!  Specials and drinks are always seasonal and on point.  Sushi is solid, but not earth shattering; it is certainly fresh, and I have to admit that it is nice to have rolls that don't try to throw the kitchen sink into them every once in a while.  Friendly and attentive service as well.  The only real drawback is that they do not take reservations, so be prepared to wait.  At least you can try to squeeze into the bar and enjoy one of those fantastic cocktails!"}
{"text":"This felt like a very hip place. Cool dj spinning all night long, fashionable 20 and 30 somethings enjoying drinks and tapas style dishes, lots of laughing and fun.  The shrimp skewers were great, so was most everything."}
{"text":"Pork belly tacos, sashimi tacos, lamb lollipops, salmonopita, bone marrow, Korean wings, fried Brussels sprouts, and more. I was there with colleagues and we shared a feast of small plates. All of them were so good. We also had excellent service. This is a gem amongst many good places in Uptown."}
{"text":"Astronomical food! Always start with the pork belly tacos! , Then everything else is the !  Drinks are the best around!"}
{"text":"The pork belly tacos with watermelon are the closest thing to a spiritual experience I've yet to experience. Thought it sounded a little odd at first but the flavors compliment each other SO well!  Do yourself a favor. It's worth the trip out here JUST to try these guys. But I recommend coming with a group and ordering a bunch of stuff to taste with friends. EVERYTHING was delicious!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites and I'm a major foodie. Pork Belly Tacos and Lamb Lollipops are insane. If you don't get there early, it's a pretty long wait. We don't ever concern ourselves with the wait, we chill at the bar with the amazing creations that the highly knowledgeable bartenders have to offer. It's not a place to go to just eat--it's an experience from the moment you walk in to the last bite."}
{"text":"MAJOR KEY ALERT: This place is amazing, definitely worth the wait. Use the No Wait app to get a reservation without going in first."}
{"text":"You'll have to wait but go downstairs to the art gallery for a drink or two to pass the time. I HATE waiting, but the food is well worth the wait.   Get the lamb lollies, tuna skewers, pork tacos, brussels. My favorite restaurant in CLT."}
{"text":"Date night, Friday night, hell, even a Tuesday at noon; it's always a good time to venture to Soul. Unfortunately, this is not a little known secret, and it has become a popular dining destination. Expect a wait; it's part of the experience.   Yelpers love the pork belly tacos topped with watermelon cubes, and taking their cue, I followed suit. This was a good decision. We also ordered the ramen bowl, which consisted of noodles topped with garlic cream, braised veal, goat cheese fried mushrooms... it was good. This was a moment I had to remind myself not to lick the bowl...  When asked if we wanted to see a dessert menu; I informed our server I would just take a gander. Which lead me to ordering the chocolate brioche bread pudding. I am a sucker for cocoa nibs and caramel ice cream, and couldn't resist.  There are many options on the menu I am excited to try on our next visit, too!"}
{"text":"This place puts Charlotte foodie dining to shame. Halibut cheeks, rocky mountain oysters, bone marrow, and anything else a food lover would want. Not to even mention the stellar and inventive bar menu. Don't leave without trying a gin and tonic on tap!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about this place! We loved the variety of dishes and tried several of them. I love the cucumber in my water as it was a great palate cleanser between each dish. We tried the Rocky Mountain Oyster and hubby enjoyed them but they were not for me. It had nothing to do with the chef, just me. I love that I could try them. The Pork Belly tacos all I can say is amazing! I loved the Guacamole salad and can't say enough about the Pulled Pork Shells. For dessert we had the Banana turnovers which were okay but the Chocolate Bread Pudding I will be dreaming about for a long time. We are not from the area but this will be my stop whenever I go visit Charlotte. As for price, I don't think the prices are bad for tapas but I am sure ordering can get away with you if you let it. Our waiter was great at explaining this and extremely knowledgable."}
{"text":"Meeting a friend for drinks and a quick meal before heading to a party and what a great pit stop.  Soul is located on a major road with cool views for people watching. The parking reminded me of New Jersey/New York having to pay to park or drive around until you find a free one so I chose to pay $5 which ain't bad. Located upstairs and when I say it's a hot spot, it was LIVE and packed. The music was great and the bartender I had (cool guy with these awesome throwback shades) made perfect drinks & recommended drinks for my friends. Our bartender was able to explain the drinks very well and sold us on a few.  We ended up ordering a few tapas which were cooked to perfection & I wanted to order more but this was just a pit stop . It took a while for the tapas to come out (Lamb, Shrimp, Beef, Wings) but was so worth it. We met tons of nice folks.  I will say the place seems small bc it was packed and we were told a 2hr wait for a table so thank goodness we came just in time when a group was leaving. We stayed there for at least 3 hrs and the 3 tables near the bar were there before we got there and we left before them so heads up folks.   Come for tapas & drinks chill at the bar or go outside on the patio. It's good people watching outside so hint hint ."}
{"text":"On the fourth try using the app, we were able to get a table. Do yourself a favor and just leave early and go to a bar nearby. The app doesn't update the expected wait time and if you miss your window to be seated, you have to wait for another hour or two.  The atmosphere was the best part. You walk in to a hip feeling diverse environment with excellent lighting. There was a DJ which was different for a dinner experience, his song choices ranged from good to bad and I enjoyed it much more than she did.  We ordered two drinks, both were bad. The drinks actually summarize this restaurant. They try to be too fancy and hip but completely fail to execute. Do yourself a favor, order your favorite classic drink or beer instead.  The food was mediocre for the price. You get the feeling that the chef doesn't know what they're doing in designing some of the dishes, especially their careless use of fresh jalapeno.  The counter to this is that everything seemed fresh, which in Charlotte can be hard to find.  The pork tacos are just bland meat in bland sauce on a bland flour tortilla with watermelon ok top. The sauce should make it pop but it doesnt. I'd rather pay $3 dollars down the street at a Mexican food place and get better food.  I enjoyed the ahi tuna skewers.  The shrimp ceviche was tasty but beware, my dish had bits of suuuuper spicy jalapeno. The jalapeno taste is a bad shock that nukes your pallette until you can recover. I love eating fresh jalapeno but these were either too spicy or just out of place.  We had some sashimi (or is it nagiri) later too that was good. It had a cute salad with it that was good except for again you had to pick past massive strips of thickly cut fresh jalapeno. It added nothing to the dish and was almost a disaster had I not told her that she was about to eat it.  She liked their Brussels sprouts the best out of all the dishes we had.   The people next to us had a glass of wine and a cheese plate. I think that's the way to do this place. Go in with a clear strategy, and maybe try one or two new things. If you go in wanting to taste lots of good food you will be left wanting."}
{"text":"WOW!!!! This place rocks. It takes forever to get a seat, but man it is worth the wait. This place had got a menu that if you don't find something you want you just ain't hungry! From sushi to tapas they got it."}
{"text":"So, so good. My only regret is not ordering from the glorious cocktail menu (although a bottle of ros√© was second best). While visiting my sisters in the area, we stopped into Soul and feasted on tapas after stopping next door for a drink. Starting with the coconut shrimp ceviche with plantain chips, we moved on to the  fried brussels, Southern fried oysters, and bone marrow - all were absolutely fabulous. Despite the wait to be seated, our service was SO quick and efficient (much appreciated). Such a wonderful experience overall - would return in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Food was off the chart. Goat Cheese Ice Cream sounds crazy I know but with the sweet taste of ice cream the goat cheese added a *bitter and sour* hint of flavor to the dish. Veal Shortribs tender (braised not boiled) but not over cooked great dish. Gryo Lollypops fresh lamb and beef never a bad idea. Tip my hat to the chef  Great staff and vibe"}
{"text":"Having moved back to Charlotte and into the Plaza neighborhood it was about time I gave this place another try. Midweek dinner with a friend the hostess was great with accommodating us quickly and the service was great. I wish I could say the same about the food. Don't get me wrong the food isn't terrible it just isn't great. You know I am expecting awesome food when I am paying $10 for 10 brussel sprouts. Unfortunately it just didn't live up to the hype. I would go back for the ambiance - let's be real it's an awesome date spot in terms of being comfy and cozy. However not only was the food lackluster, but the portions are definitely smaller and the price tag larger than the Soul Gastrolounge of yesteryear."}
{"text":"Great food and price but expect to wait some time for a table"}
{"text":"So hipster. The waitstaff just kinda has that whatever attitude. Also a cockroach crawled across the bench when we were eating. Eeeeek  However the food was really good so I didn't complain."}
{"text":"Soul is a great place and a unique experience in terms of food and atmosphere. I came to Soul after they first opened and have returned several times for dinner or just drinks. I have been generally impressed with the quality of food, (have tried many specials as well as house favorites) have enjoyed the unique cocktails as well as the creativity of the bartenders. Their location is in Plaza-Midwood neighborhood in an old building which provides the perfect atmosphere for Soul's unique vibe.  The downside of Soul is that it is very small AND pretty crowded. The staff is a bit picky about where small groups can or cannot sit as well as those who intend to eat food vs. just have drinks. I find their logic to be flawed at times as I remember an incident where I came right after opening (to an empty restaurant) and was not allowed to grab a table. I'd suggest they go with the flow and err on the side of satisfied regulars. I'll caulk that one up to a one-off incident and hopefully not the norm.   All of this said, I love Soul and hope they continue to serve things up in their unique and cool way."}
{"text":"I don't eat lamb... or well, that's a thing of the past, now that I've tried the   lamb lollipops at Soul. They were simply delicious, and that's just one of the many good things about this place!! Everything from the cucumber cosmo to the sushi, from the hummus platter to the vibe and atmosphere here.... this place is just overall cool! I recently moved from the bay area to Charlotte, and I've already found a favorite spot here :) I look forward to going back to Soul again and trying other delicious foods off their menu!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night.  Sat outside on the deck with a warm heater.  Food is really good.  Many Tapa dishes to try so perfect for a group.  Sushi was excellent.  The Quean City Roll was fantastic....tempura shrimp and cucumber...oh yea.  My wife loves the brussel sprouts and the local NoDa beer was good.  The great diverse menu will have us coming back."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Drinks are good. The people that work here have serious attitude though. That's the reason I wouldn't come back. The long haired guy at the bar thinks he's too cool for school and the brunette waitress literally looked at me and laughed at me with other patrons like a teenage girl. I don't recommend this place that thinks it's way better than it is. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Despite the two-hour wait, I'm relieved to say it deserves the hype.  The Good  I love eel sushi and Soul makes the best eel roll I've ever had. It's served with no extra filling, which means you focus on the succulence and sweetness of the meat alone. Absolutely divine.  Soul also makes the best flatbread I've ever had. It's made with truffle whipped goat cheese, pistachio pesto, honey braised garlic, and fresh arugula.   The Not-So-Good  Oh my god, the wait. We went at about 8:00 on a Friday night and the hostess said it would be a 2.5 hour wait. We walked over to Workman's Friend instead. Determined to try it again, we came back the next night at about the same time. This time a 2 hour wait. Luckily we found bar stools to get comfortable and ultimately decided to eat at the bar.  We ordered mules. We were thrown off that it's served on tap. And way, way too sweet.   The shells and cheese, made with BBQ glazed pork belly, were unremarkable. I wish we ordered the pork belly tacos instead. The fried meatballs didn't wow me either.  So, in summary, a few items on the menu blew me away enough to still give Soul my 4-star rating. Order the eel, flatbread, and prepare yourself for the wait."}
{"text":"awesome food and great service! favorites in order.. veal short ribs, tuna sashimi tacos, bone narrow, fried cheese saganaki style, and the tzatziki/hummus/babaganoush plate was amazing.. you could really tell all of the ingredients in the dishes were fresh as the flavors really stood out. I'm not from charlotte but this restaurant made me wish I was."}
{"text":"Wow ! The food was delicious . There was a wait for seating but they're able to text you when your tables ready . Lucky there was a seat outside and we took it . A bit cozy outside but it worked .   The pork and watermelon tacos were so so good ! Get them if they're available.   The salad was very refreshing and the chicken skins were good , but I can only have many one . It's very very filling .  Another item to get is the Asian style hot wings . Different and delicious.   Also had dessert . It was a thin flaky type of pastry filled and had ice cream on the side . Different but I enjoyed it .   Go here !!!"}
{"text":"Soul Gastrolounge has gotten Way too full of itself.  I have never been treated so rudely at any other restaurant, ever.   I have been to Soul at least a handful of times.  I've always enjoyed it.  However, the last time I attempted to dine there I was treated to a truly shocking display of rudeness.  I knew it was going to be a long wait, so when I was told it was going to be 90 minutes I wasn't the least bit surprised. However, I did find it a bit odd that that I was 3rd in line and that it was still going to be that long before I was seated.   I hopped around Plaza Midwood to kill some time.  90 minutes later I called and somehow I was still 3rd in line.  This defied logic.  2.5 hours later I called and was told that I was fourth in line.  Uhmmm... how is it possible to move backward in the line after waiting 2.5 hours?  When I posed this question I was very rudely told that it was my fault for not having downloaded a seating app.  At this point it was so late that other restaurants in the area were no longer serving.    I had out of town friends with me and this was their introduction to Charlotte.  Never in my life have I been treated so poorly at a restaurant.  Soul will certainly be just fine without my business (which they will never get again).  The food is good, but with the ever improving Charlotte restaurant scene, Soul Gastro may lose some of its following if this level (lack of) customer service continues."}
{"text":"This  restaurant  is so close to us, but so far away.  We live a few blocks from it, but it is impossible to get a seat.  So, what is a 7:30/8:00 dinner couple to do?  Go early!  We went at 6:30 on Sunday night, Labor Day weekend and were seated immediately. I ordered the most lucious wine, Butternut Chardonnay.  My man got an IPA. We chose the sushi special, which was called Wasabi. But, it really wasn't spicy on its own.  We also got fried oysters.  Primo!  A flatbread featuring truffle whipped giant cheese, honey, arugula and pistachio goat cheese.  Amazing!  And spanakopita in the shape of those little paper \"footballs\" that some of us used to make out of paper and thump with our fingers when we were kids.  You could really taste that fresh dill. I always enjoy the vibe in this place.  The energy and service are great.  Love the catwalk music. So next time we want quality tapas food, we will go the Eatly Bird  Special route,.  It's that good."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite spot in Charlotte. The food is absolutely the best. Such an eclectic menu to keep your tastebuds entertained as well as your date. The ambience is quaint and high class at the same time. High quality without the high dollar."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant on a Thursday night and got there pretty early in the evening because we heard it gets crowded quickly. I think we got there just in time and probably got the last booth. We sat across from a busy and extremely well stocked bar. Our waiter was very attentive. We ordered pita chips and dip first and they were wonderful! Then we moved on to the pork belly tacos and the Ramen bowl.  Both were superb, although the tacos were my favorite! We added sushi and a pita sandwich and shared everything between the four of us.  This place can get pricy,  especially with eclectic tastes and drinks.  However, it has a huge variety of food and can easily accomidate those who enjoy sharing small plates, as well as those who want their own entree. If you park at the nearby shopping center, it's an easy walk to the restaurant. Great food!"}
{"text":"My husband wanted to treat me to a nice evening while we visited Charlotte for my birthday weekend and, because of the great reviews on Yelp and the fact that we love tapas, we gave Soul a try.   It felt a little uncomfortable at first because, as cool as we like to think we are for 50-somethings, we are not that hip. This place attracts a young crowd. They don't take reservations, and I knew we were in for a good 1.5 hour wait and all I could think was, what in the world will we do? In total, this place is less than 1000 sq ft inside and out. There is absolutely no where to stand, sit, or lean against, and the crowd on a Sat. night was tight. The stars must have been in my favor because one barstool opened up in the \"first come first served\" area and we claimed it for the next, you guessed it, 1.5 hours. While we waited, I sipped wine and water, and my hub tried one of their signature mixed drinks. We had a lot of time to watch all the bartenders, all of whom were very fast, talented, and knew how to handle the crowd (especially a very drunk, loud and offensive guy who was asked to leave. Nice touch).    While we waited, we also tried the dip trio, which came with generous amounts of tzatziki, babaganoush, and hummus, with mostly too-hard-to-eat (and burned) pita chips. As Robert Irvine would say, something like that should have never left the kitchen. Though, our wonderfully attentive bartenders made up for that faux pas by refilling our chips every time the bowl was near empty. It was all good, but I really enjoyed the tzatziki the most, and it would have been even better with warm, soft pita. As you might imagine, I wasn't very hungry by the time our table was ready.   Anyway, after getting there around 7:45, we were seated around 9:30 or so. I ordered the avocado stack, which is a salad of sliced avocado, red onion, cilantro, tomato and fried garlic, drizzled with olive oil. So pretty (see pic) and tasty. I then tried the garlic skewered shrimp, which was light and savory. I enjoyed all of this while my hub sat across from me with nothing in front of him, as I believe his mango sushi order was lost. Ever the patient one, he nibbled off my plates until his sushi finally arrived, and it was beautiful (see pic). A huge portion, and he said some of the best sushi he's ever had.  I saw people ordering the pork belly tacos, which are described on the menu with \"watermelon salsa\". Interestingly enough, they come out looking like three cubes of meat on a flour tortilla, with three cubes of watermelon on top of the meat, so it's not actually a chopped up salsa. I wondered if the watermelon was marinated and will have to give it a try next time.   We were too tired and full for dessert so didn't indulge, as much as I would have loved to try the bread pudding cupcake with pretzel whipped cream.   So all in all, a great evening of food and entertainment. A DJ did start spinning music about 9:00 or so, and it was a mix of everything from 80s to techno to jazz, which went along with the cool vibe of this place with the exposed brick, open rafters, and low lighting. Just go prepared to be patient and wait if you show up at prime time, and just relax and enjoy something new."}
{"text":"Ventured over to Soul last night for a lite bite with a friend.  I'm so glad I did.  It was a great experience.  The service was friendly, the food was very good (for the most part) and the price was right in my opinion.   It was packed for a Thursday night..they had a 45 minute wait but we were seated at the bar immediately.  Our server was super friendly and he was very attentive the whole evening.   We tried the white bean/goat cheese dip---pretty good, small portion and couldn't really taste the goat cheese but it was decent.  The pita chips were a little stale.  Next we tried the curried lamb skewers with mango chutney....this was the show stopper....SOOOOO good!  The lamb was cooked perfectly and the flavoring was not too spicy/hot...it was just perfect...SOO on point!  I HIGHLY recommend trying it!!  We also tried a tuna roll...I can't remember the name but it had cream cheese, it was flash fried, had jalapeno and something else....it was excellent.  Fresh, tasty, just enough crunch, etc.    Lastly, we tried their newest cupcake addition....it was a dark chocolate cupcake with carmel on the top with whipped cream.  This was the biggest disappointment of the night.  The cupcake was dry as could be with ZERO flavor.  If you closed your eyes to take a bite you wouldn't know what flavor you were sampling.  It might be the worst cupcake I have ever tried.  I noticed they pistachio ice cream on the menu and I should have gone with my first instinct and ordered that instead.  Steer clear of their cupcakes...they are not worth the $4.    Overall...like everyone has repeatedly stated...great atmosphere, fun people-watching, good food and just an overall solid spot.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love coming here with my friends! Though I try to avoid going here on the weekend because it's usually a 1-2 hours wait. Which I don't mind since there's the bar downstairs. :) The food here would be classify as eclectic. Like the Pork Belly Tacos has watermelon in it but is phenomenal! Love their drink list. Sushi are great. Duck Banh Mi is amazinggggg! Bone Marrow is fresh (still in the bone kind of fresh lol). All my friends love this place after I take them there and now they're addicted!"}
{"text":"I love SOUL!!!  I would give them 5 stats but the bartenders can get a little temperamental at times.  The food and atmosphere is great.  A good variety for everyone's palate."}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review. But as a decade long front-house restaurant employee who currently works in a 4-star restaurant, I tend to have a more critical eye than the average Yelper. Whether you're fan or not of Soul is immaterial. You should read this (atypical) review regardless.  Within the last two weeks, a friend of mine called Soul to place a takeout order of their Shrimp Ceviche. As I'm en route to pick it up for her, (coming across town 30 mins to do so) she promptly called back to tell me that they wouldn't allow her to buy that specific item for \"Take-Out\" due to {insert erroneous/illogical reason here from an employee}. The problem was, I've already ordered that item \"To-Go\" before.  On principle, I was perturbed. Saw I called personally and asked to speak to a leadership position.   I was told [paraphrased]; that the head chef didn't think that particular dish was appropriate to serve as a \"To-Go\" item, as its quality (and his work) would be devalued upon consumption if not on site.  As someone who eats out 1-2 times a week, I can honestly appreciate the sentiment. Nonetheless, I ultimately felt that if I'm a paying guest for a product (that's in stock) I should be able to receive said item without a hurdle. Cash for product = service, I felt.  Once explained, a female manager (pardon me, as I can't recall her name) promptly and kindly addressed my issue and told me it'll be ready in 20 minutes. I showed up...it was ready...and I left. The food (as always from Soul) was phenomenal, even in a box on a 20 min car ride.  So here's your bottom line...  If you're on the fence about going there, don't be. Trust me, just go there. This place is awesome. Prior to this story, I've been there 20 times and always left happy. Their food and their cocktails (particularly their bourbon list, personally) are worth your time and your money. It can be a first-date or a chill night with your main. Their ambiance covers all bases and their menu covers all tastes. A real staple for the community of Charlotte.   P.S. Pork Belly Tacos..."}
{"text":"I had the best cocktail of my life here,  this dude lit the orange in my cup on fire!  Can't go wrong! Talented mixologist for sure. The food is incredible,  I love the div-y feel of this bar."}
{"text":"We ate here before a show at ovens auditorium. It was close enough that we didn't have to rush through our meal. The food was excellent. The pork belly tacos were very good but I cut the pieces of watermelon in half because I'm not much of a watermelon fan.  My wife and I also had the flatbread which was good. The southern nachos were our favorite. We had one of their cocktails (the mule one, can't remember it's name) which was well made and very good. The restaurant isn't that large and doesn't take reservations so make sure to give yourself time to wait. There is an app you can download to get yourself on the waitlist as well."}
{"text":"Hipster vibes with classy eats  Plaza Midwood is kicking and Soul Gastrolounge is no exception. Soul is located on the second level, so don't try to go to the front door. With the doors opening at 5pm and them not taking reservations I suggest arriving early if you want to eat at a decent time. Soul is also on the app \"Nowait\", where you can put your name on the list only if there is a wait.   Arriving at 6:30pm on a Friday night it was almost an hour wait if we wanted to eat inside. We sat on the enclosed balcony. This area also has heat lamps and overlooks the skyline, not a bad deal. I wanted to sit inside because it was our first time at Soul, but waiting over an hour was not going to fly.   Libations A lot of their specialty drinks are on tap which I found interesting. The Feeling Squirrley was an awesome beverage, but I don't think it was worth $13.  Cucumber Mule was light refreshing and had just the kick it needed.   Grubs Keep in mind these are tapas //small plates. You should share with folks, but when you have a veggie and a meat eater together it's a little hard. We opted to share a sushi and then get our own small plate. The portions are decently sized for being tapas. +Dirty South Nachos, the pickled okra was the best part of these. Felt a little overdone and trying too hard for Soul. +Flatbread- this is the reason I would bring someone to Soul. This flatbread had my taste buds jumping for joy.  +Dancing Tuna Roll- Seared tuna with avocado are what dreams are made of. This roll made up for the wait, the drinks and the chicken skin nachos. I can't even tell you about it because you'll just have to try it yourself.   Try to make it to Soul in the Summer right before sunset."}
{"text":"Hands down the freshest and best prepared sushi i've ever eaten and i've eatin sushi all over the world and im still in disbeleif that id find that great if tasting fish in land locked charlotte. I will tell my kids, kids, kids to way here.     Went on a late monday night and didn't have much of a crowd at all."}
{"text":"I could talk about this place for days, but ille spare you the long review. I absolutely love this place. The wait time is one of the few things I dislike but let me tell you, its worth it. The pork belly tacos are RIDIC. So yummy! Their sweet menu isnt my favorite but even so, i come back again and again for their savory stuff."}
{"text":"Great dinner spot for tapas and cocktails! I tried the pork belly tacos, the pokemon sushi roll, and the avocado salad. All of which were very good. It is definitely too much food for one person though, so I highly recommend sharing! Try to get a place in line through the NoWait app, so that you won't have to wait as long when you arrive. The restaurant almost always has a wait."}
{"text":"Tapas Dining at its best! The decor is very eclectic for example there is a DJ booth that you can sit at with a stuffed Peacock on the wall. If you have been in this area before its to be expected though. I would suggest sharing plates with your dinner date up to 4-5 my favorites were the fried goat cheese on bruschetta, veal shortribs, cubanni, and anything from the sushi menu including the squid salad are superb!"}
{"text":"Was home for the thanksgiving weekend and got a chance to catch up with some girlfriends and this place is always first on my list! It's tapas/bar near dt Charlotte and boy is it good!   If you have a big party, this is probably not the best place to go. It's more of an intimate setting / best for small groups. The service is always good - no bad experiences there!  This time in particular we all tried the crunch roll (yum!), truffle fries (to die for), beef skewers, bone marrow, shells and cheese, pork belly tacos, dirty south nachos - all were amazing! Don't think I've tried a bad plate of food here!"}
{"text":"Get here early and expect to wait for a table. Excellent bar program and the food is really good too. I just wish they changed the menu more often."}
{"text":"hostess was extremely rude. couldn't seat us at a booth because we didn't have \"4\" people. If I was a waitress here and wasn't getting seated due to this matter I would have raised hell.. someone needs a new job. we decided to just sit at the bar...the bartender was forgetful but ended up being cool as ukfay. other than that the pork belly tacos were awesome."}
{"text":"Great place to hangout nice atmosphere with great music. We frequently go to Soul great brunch,and dinning, we highly recommend Soul as one of our favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"This place offers a distinguished menu that's unique and flavorful. It's a rather busy place and would require a wait, however it's definitely worth it. The food is always fresh well presented. The servers are well informed and take their time to take your order and explain any item on the menu. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Ok, this place rocks. The atmosphere is very urban. Low light, cool music, a couple of couches to relax. Nice bar. Very cozy. Mixologist's excellent. Tapas on par with anything in the city. The place reminds me of some sweet establishments in Chicago. Come early. After 7:00 it's standing room only."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why all the hype. Everything is a bit pricey. The food is bland. Maybe it's just not my taste."}
{"text":"I had an amazing  meal at this place. I highly recommend the Garlic Fries... these fries are incredible.  Not a big sushi eater but I tried the Queen Charlotte roll and feel in love with it.  We ended up ordering another one because it was so good.  The biggest surprise of the meal was the Pork Belly Tacos....they are a must if you visit  Soul Gastrolounge."}
{"text":"Took my parents to Soul yesterday (Sunday) for mom's birthday brunch.  We just got done with the never-ending halls at the Christmas show.  I was defying all traffic laws and regulations just to make it here before 3 (brunch is from 11-3).   As I was dashing into the door at 7mins before 3, they sat us at one of the loungy couch area immediately.  The waiter knew we were to order brunch and took our orders promptly and calmly.  He was very attentive and helpful through our meal.  Definitely thumbs up on the service (I forgot to catch his name)  We shared 3 dishes: shrimp and grits, chicken and waffle, and southern biscuit with gravy and sausage (added an egg for $1).  Here is my verdict on the food:  Best dish is chicken and waffle.  3 small pieces (2 pieces of wings and 1 thigh meat) fried super crispy yet moist (at least the wings I was eating). The waffle is fluffy. All for $9 which is quite reasonable.   Best side item is sage rope sausage. Very tasty. I can probably eat an entire plate of them. Not too salty, the casing is just crispy enough. Just simple pork greatness.   Worst side item is biscuit.  I guess I am used to flaky buttery bo biscuit. This is a little chewy and doughy.    Least worthy dish is the shrimp and grits.  It wasn't horrible, but for $12 it was disappointing. It looks and smells like awesomeness in a bowl, yet it was more bland than I would ever imagine.   Granted not everything was great (hence not a 5 stars review), I will definitely come back for another brunch. Comparing to nearby places, I find this place more economic and food choices more appealing."}
{"text":"Really good food with interesting menu.  The service and vibe can be weird and a bit stuck-up but in the end the quality and creative menu make it worth it.  Go early to avoid a long wait."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. They have a cucumber mule on tap that is delicious! Served in copper mugs, it's the perfect drink for summer.   The ambiance is really fun and funky. No reservations so you have to be prepared to have some lovely drinks while you wait.   Food: some awesome dishes. Especially love the coconut shrimp ceviche, which is super tasty. The hamachi roll melts in the mouth. The roasted Brussels sprouts have really rich flavor. And best of all, the pork belly tacos with watermelon. These are just incredibly delicious.   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Open till 2 am with a pretty decent menu and some fun things, most anything on the menu is good to go, good atmosphere and wait staff. Legit"}
{"text":"My experience at soul Gastrolounge was very terrible I arrived on December 18th at 11:20PM. When walking into the lounge it was very crowded and out of control. The hostess at the door immediately told me that the kitchen was going to be closing in a couple of seconds and I had better place my order now before they close. I proceeded to the bar to place my order and the bartender rudely asked me \"what I would like to eat\" as if I was wasting his precious time. I felt so disrespected and disappointed after receiving such a great recommendation to visit the restaurant. I have never in my life felt not welcomed in a restaurant I don't think I would ever revisited this restaurant again nor could I recommend it to anyone after the terrible unwelcoming experience."}
{"text":"The food real was great.  I meet a couple of friends here for drinks and we ended up tasting ALOT of food.  I had a Greek salad which was amazing, Brussels sprouts (I don't eat Brussels sprouts BUT) these were amazing!"}
{"text":"This is a place I have driven by many times but did not notice.  After finding out it is a popular spot, we finally made a stop.  I love this wonderful spot!  The atmosphere is great, comfy, and as another reviewer, the music is incredible; it makes you take notice!  Our server was great and well informed.  It always helps when the waiter has personally tasted the dishes being served.  Since we could not possibly experience everything on the menu, we had:  - grilled caesar salad: 4/5 - white bean/goat cheese dip:  4/5 (served cold but it grows on you) - Korean BBQ wings (not spicy at all, more sweet):  5/5 - salted caramel-popcorn buttercream cupcake:  4/5 - Punto Final Malbec (Argentina):  5/5  We ordered the sashimi tuna tacos as well, but they never made it to the table...next visit but I really didn't mind.  Soul has a small but adequate wine listing and the couple we ordered were delightful.  This is a hip but inviting spot to hang out for something to eat and drink in the Plaza-Midwood area and I always enjoy great spots that my fellow reviewers love!  Best regards..."}
{"text":"Soul was recommended by friends from Charlotte and it did not disappoint! After another restaraunt closely botched our reservation, we came to Soul and were seated immediately despite how crowded it was. The service was nicely done from start to finish. Some highlights on the menu: pork belly tacos (maybe one of the most unique bites that I've ever had), the tuna tacos, the dirty south nachos (very unique concept and well executed), lamb lollipop, flatbread, and the replay roll. Everything was fresh and delicious. I also tried the ramen, which was a special, and it was good, but not as tasteful as the other dishes that our group ordered. I'm looking forward to coming back to Soul the next time I'm in Charlotte. The cucumber in the water was a nice touch!"}
{"text":"A visit to Soul makes for a great night on the town. Grab 3 or 4 of your friends and make it an evening. First off, do not come starving as you will likely encounter a wait of 45 minutes up to 2.5 hours on a busy night (Thurs, Fri, Sat). No reservations unfortunately. It will be worth it though and once your name is on the list you can either get drinks at the bar, or walk down to Thomas Street Tavern or the wine bar just below.   The setting is intimate and I prefer the booth seating as it feels like you have your own private room for the group. The other tables are fine too, the only seating I do not recommend is at the DJ booth. There is a great view of downtown from the outside balcony, which is also very nice to take in during the Sunday brunch.   Food wise everything is unique and very well made. Start off with 3 or 4 orders of various tapas items to share amongst yourselves. I recommend the Mushrooms on Toast, watermelon pork belly tacos, or the Soul roll sushi.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for great Sushi and service this is the place to go! I suggest the dancing tuna roll, hands down! It was made to perfection. I also ordered the Tuna Nigiri and the Salmon Nigiri which were both great as well. They have a variety of signature drinks and a full bar. I went there on a weekday so there was no dj playing, however, there is a dj booth and I've been told that it gets pretty packed on the weekends. As for parking, do not park in the CVS parking lot because your car will get towed. There is street parking and I had no problem finding any."}
{"text":"The bartenders (Brian and Kelly) were rly friendly and helpful in terms of recommendations!  My meal of tuna tacos, bone marrow, and the supernova sushi special was actually amazing. I would come back to Charlotte just to eat here again!"}
{"text":"GREAT atmosphere! Couldn't ask for a better location just to hang out and have a glass of wine...AND talk to complete strangers! Truly enjoyed myself!"}
{"text":"I really love this place, but the small plates, wait times, and price are the things that deter me from giving this place a 5 star review. Love their drink menu and love their food, but I would recommend getting a reservation ahead of time!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best cocktails in Charlotte. The bartenders are super attentive and knowledgeable. The food is solidly good. A nice selection of both vegetable dishes and heavier meat stuff and seafood in-between. Most days they also have a live DJ spinning some cool tracks. Overall, the best place to hang out."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. By far the best food and drinks I've ever had. And it's in Charlotte! And so close to my house. The food here is seriously like sex in your mouth. Everything is delicious. This night I got to taste a friends lobster soup and I swear I wanted to jump in the bowl and live in it. I haven't had anything here is didn't like. Example cold meat plate. I would never order that but it's amazing. And of course the lamb skewers are incredible. Better than a filet. Truffle fries, well yes please! This place need to never close down.   And don't get discouraged by your long wait. It's totally worth it. In fact order as much as you can with a friend or many friends and share. Taste as much as you can. I haven't had the brunch but that's hopefully going to be my next visit."}
{"text":"Came by last night for a few drinks with a friend . Was seated promptly ,  but decided to sit at the bar. Bartender  was very friendly and attentive and I loved the fact we didn't have to hunt him down to make a drink .  My friend tried the \"James Ryan \" cocktail special . He enjoyed the drink  so much he ordered a second and I enjoyed watching it being made . I loved the ambiance and how chill it was . It's definitely a great place for drinks , conversation and some good music .  ( snippet of drink being made uploaded)"}
{"text":"Soul is unique with some good/interesting food options.  I wish I had a drink here, as they all looked great, but I had plenty the day before, so I wasn't feeling up to it.  I even saw Bob the Bartender slinging drinks from behind the bar, so that is always a great sign.  We tried to go here a number of times, but the place is small, there is always a long wait, so get there early, (i.e. before dinner time) if you want to sit immediately.  I started off with the Pork Belly Tacos, and they were amazing.  I would suggest splitting these, though, as they get heavy on your stomach pretty quick.  Especially if you are going to sample other menu items.  The fried cheese was also great.  I ended up just eating by itself, rather than on the bread.  The service was slightly below average, as it seems like they serve their food in batches (e.g. they make a large batch of pork bell tacos and everyone gets it at the same time regardless of when you ordered), and our server was mostly absent.  The big down sides are 1) getting a seat, and 2) sitting on the lap of absolute strangers once you do get a seat.  I really hate cramped seating, so next time I would try and get their 1-2 booths that have.  I would love to come back here for some drinks, but I would target an afternoon or an off peak time."}
{"text":"YUMMMMM!! They have a little bit of everything - and everything is GOOD!!  Sundays is brunch only - If you're going for dinner get there between 5p-5:30 if you actually want to get a seat and eat before 7pm (outdoor seating  has views of the city skyline) - Pork Belly Tacos ARE the Best thing on the menu (it sounds gross, watermelon & meat, but seriously scrumdiddlyumptious).  Best tip about this place: Be sure you know your liquor - they don't have Beefeater gin and tried to pass off a lower-shelf for it."}
{"text":"I go this place about once a month for dinner. I've lived in Charlotte for three years and this has been our favorite place the entire time. Takes a while to get a table, but it is well worth it."}
{"text":"I concur with everything regarding dinner so I will review breakfast.  The Sunday brunch is one of the best breakfast experiences I have ever had. Groovy Sunday morning music plays at a good volume as the DJ spins classics, Every item on the menu is decadent and amazing. The bloody mary's and mint juleps pull no punches. And every item is an urgent wake up alarm brimming with flavor and attention to detail.  I think I am addicted. Soul's brunch turns a hungover Sunday into a downright religious experience as we commune at the bacchian temple of good times, good drinks, and good food."}
{"text":"So I got drunk one night in Charlotte and made some new friends.* Whenever there was a lull in our magniloquent discourse on the finer points of the economy, microbiology and NASCAR, I'd ask them where I might find the best meal in Charlotte. There was a lot of hemming and hawing from most people, but about 40% of them instantly pointed me toward Soul.  That kind of percentage can't be ignored, so when I was able to drag myself out of bed the next morning, I headed over for brunch.   I must admit that Soul and I got off on the wrong foot because they refused to serve me liquor before noon. However, once our server was able to gasp out (past my hands wrapped around his windpipe) that it was North Carolina's ridiculous law rather than their personal decision, we moved past it. And everything from that moment on was perfect, because everything included their shrimp and grits.   Our lovely waiter Marlon sold me on the dish, and it truly was architecturally interesting as he described. Instead of a bowl of shrimp and grits (as I'm used to), it was more like fried grit cubes with the shrimp and sauce poured over. And it was beautiful, rich, salty amazingness. The only downside was that I wanted more. (Her french toast panini was nothing to sneeze at either, but I'm a savor-tooth tiger to the core.)  I'm sure it would've been a better brunch with a bloody mary, but this was a meal I'll eat every time I'm in Charlotte, and you probably should too.  _________________  *Depending on your perspective, I suppose you could say that I bothered a lot of strangers."}
{"text":"On my first visit to this Charlotte hot spot I cannot add anything bad to the raving reviews. they're all true. Every small plate we had was delicious, the wine list had some great choices although a couple were not available. I recommend getting there early or on an off night as this place seems to be very popular for very good reason. You should go and be prepared to enjoy some delicious food. One warning, the bill adds up very quickly even though you are having small plates."}
{"text":"You should know before you even plan on coming here that pretty much any night of the week there WILL be a wait. Sometimes it's 2 hours. And they don't take reservations. But having said that, it's worth it. My favorite place to wait is downstairs at Twenty Two, the art gallery. Grab a drink there and look out for them to text you when your table is ready. If it's a nice night, the patio at Soul is perfect. You can watch people walking on the street below and look out at the Charlotte skyline. Most importantly: the food is great. I always always always get the fries. Even if my main course is sushi, I always get fries. They're too good. The sushi is also really good by the way. Mini burgers are great. People rant and rave about the pork belly tacos but they're not my style (too sweet for me -- but still delicious). They have entree, sushi, and drink specials that don't disappoint and change frequently. There are many things on the menu I have yet to try, but I've loved it all so far."}
{"text":"Pan con tomate, pork belly tacos, shells and cheese, meatballs, lamb lollipops...bring friends and split ALL the small plates.  Cucumber mule to die for!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and each time I was utterly impressed. The first time I got the ramen which was so tasty, the meat so tender, and the noodles fresh and delicious. I also got the infamous pork belly tacos which lived up to their hype, and are a no brainier. The second time I got the bahn mi duck sandwich that was the perfect size, rich, and filling. Can't wait to try their brunch and sushi!!"}
{"text":"First time, everything was delicious! Favorites were shrimp cerviche, fried Brussels sprouts"}
{"text":"Long awaited and overdue. I can not believe as long as I have been going here I hadn't done a review on them yet. This is going to be short because I have absolutely no complaints I'm going to sum it all up by saying great food , great drinks, great people, great vibes. Never have I went to Soul Gastrolounge in years of coming here have I had anything I didn't like and in my opinion hands down they have some of the best mixed drinks and best bartenders Charlotte has to offer. Do yourself a favor and make this a must go to stop! Thank me later."}
{"text":"Soul is a trendy new age restaurant/bar and any restaurant that plays music is a winner in my book. I'm just that kind of guy; I appreciate music and believe it adds to the ambiance. The music selection also compliments the decor and Soul's prime upstairs real estate. Some patrons are what we might label as hipsters and C Town is glad to have you Soul.   And now on to the star of the show, fooooooood. The menu is quite eclectic. Tapas is the theme and items range from baba ganoush to sushi to bone marrow. For it not being a true sushi restaurant, the tuna was amazingly fresh and of high quality. So fresh that I can also honestly say that it was better than some real so called sushi restaurants around town. All of the menu items looked so enticing that I really wanted to try them all in one sitting. Next time P, next time."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. It has a great vibe to it, some cool specialty drinks and eats. I heard its hard to get into, but we walked right in and got a seat. We did come relatively early, 5 ish. We had spent some time at the local breweries and decided we wanted some food. Given all the 5 star ratings, we wanted to see what the fuss was about. The place is really quite small, but everything we ordered was very tasty. And the service was also very good. Atmosphere, great food, great drink, adds up to 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"Always crowded here so make sure you are there in time! We always have to wait for like an hour if we arrive later than 6 pm for dinner, especially on weekends. But probably one of the best sushis I've ever tasted! And loved the tuna taco too. I love that they serve smaller dishes combined with larger so you can choose and mix between everything. One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to fall in love with this place, maybe my expectations were too high. Everyone I spoke to raved about this place and Yelp gives it great reviews, but if I'm being completely honest, Soul you left me a tad disappointed. We will start with the bad and end with the good.  No reservations- always upsets me, really? why not? The hostess didn't offer to sit up outside ( I wasn't aware we could actually sit outside until I saw a few people grab a table)  We ordered 4 tapas. The eggplant parm skewers were 2/5. They tasted like over breaded, burnt to a crisp mozzarella sticks. Not a great way to start off our dinner. The  pork belly tacos 3/5- they fell short, the pork was very dry and chewy, not a huge fan.  The dumpster downstairs was overflowing with trash and even when I tried not to focus on the awful smell it would creep up and smack you in the face ( Not really sure if it was Soul's dumpster... It could just be bad luck. I thought some of the pricing seemed  pretty high for what you were getting. there is absolutely no way pork belly tacos (2) should be 12 dollars.   Moving on to the good... The waitress was friendly, quick and overall a good and nice waitress ( extra extra brownie points for trying to hard to light the birthday candle)  The dancing tuna roll was awesome- 5/5 stars AMAZING  The Goat cheese flat bread was rich, warm and with a perfect flaky crust... YUM 4/5  The chocolate chocolate  cupcake was quite delish, not the best I have ever had, but not bad at all.  The view was so pretty and with the warm August breeze we never waned to leave. Soul, I will give you another shot and change up my ordering.  Thank you for a different dinning experience even if a few options fell short of expectations."}
{"text":"Awesome place , would definitely come again. I am from NYC and usually have high end standards. This place meets them . Food tastes amazing"}
{"text":"Went here based solely on the wonderful reviews online and I was not disappointed. Food was excellent. I got the flatbread and the mini burgers. Both were delicious. My drinks were delicious as well. Next time I'm in Charlotte I will most certainly be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Table outside if perfect on a nice night.  Food is really good here, unique choices/combinations.  I recommend you check it out!"}
{"text":"If you've never eaten at Soul Gastrolounge, you may be tempted to dismiss it, but if you do, you may be making the biggest mistake of your foodie life here in Charlotte. While it may not look like much from the outside, and climbing those fire-escape-style steps may look like a hazard, you will be rewarded upon entrance with some of the most delicious, food-forward tastes you will have ever experienced here in the Queen City. Not only is their sushi amazingly fresh and considered some of the best in town on many \"best-of' lists, but the taste combinations are often amazingly radical even for most sushi devotees. Other non-sushi items are also what could be called flavor-wells due to the sheer amount of good tastes contained within. Even though by some standards the menu could be considered small, everything (if you are an adventurous eater) is constructed for what I call \"optimum flavor density\". You know how you can taste several flavors when sampling a glass of wine? When eating at Soul it seems like everything is gauged to make you experience multiple flavor combinations, all of them amazing. Some issues are present that may hinder your enjoyment and one is the restaurant is on the small side and tends to get packed quickly so there may be a wait. Another is the lack of parking in Plaza Midwood, which affects all businesses there, not just Soul. There is no parking specifically for the restaurant, so be careful were you park, many places in the area may tow your car. As long as you educate yourself on your parking options you will be fine but the drugstore across the streets tows as well as others so find a safe place where you can park for a few hours and enjoy your dining experience. This restaurant is amazing."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite restaurants and definitely my favorite in Charlotte. This was our go to date night spot when living here and no return trip there is complete without a visit!  You must try the pork belly tacos, this is the one dish I crave the most! Their sushi is top notch and they always have a delicious cupcake feature which never disppoints.  I have tried to find a surrogate place like this near to where I live but nowhere comes close!"}
{"text":"Still good, but for the love of god..change your menu seasonally!! There's too many other great restaurants in Charlotte and in my opinion, this place can no longer compete. The last time I went everything was disappointing (even something as simple as the flatbread; it was overcooked and burnt on the bottom)."}
{"text":"In and out in 45 minutes, full and happy. Can't ask for more.  I had the Greek salad, tuna tacos, and tuna skewers - all were fantastic. Washed them down with a NoDa Midnight Madness, which was great. The service was quick and friendly, and it seemed like a pretty hip scene (tattoos and undercuts everywhere). There was also a live DJ, which was pretty cool for a Tuesday night.  My only complaints were that there was a limited selection of beers on tap (although based on the set up, my guess is they make some mean cocktails) and the meal was a bit pricy - I ended up paying close to $40."}
{"text":"If you're looking for culinary excellence in Charlotte, this is definitely a spot you need to check out. The flavors each dish brings will not only blow your mind but also your taste buds. It should definitely be known that each item is small and invokes it's diners to order many plates and share amongst themselves.  But if you decide to eat here, the ASIAN GLAZED PORK BELLY TACOS are a must order with the SALMON-O-PITA a close second.   On the drink side, their bartenders have an exquisite pallet to create drinks with multiple levels of flavor."}
