{"text":"I might be a little biased, since I've been coming here since I was in school to get their Greek Style Poutine. I still crave it once in a while now. $3.99 gets you a take-out container full of fries, with feta cheese, tzatziki, and some oregano sprinkled on. Yum! The fries are just the frozen kind, of course, its fast food nothing fancy. They usually fry them fresh for me, so at least I know they haven't been sitting around for who know how long. I've also tried the Gyro wrap, its pretty good as well. But the majority of the time I get the Poutine. It's a pretty big portion, I get full from it for only $3.99, and I can't eat anything else."}
{"text":"This place is inside a smaller mall with few small restaurants in its food court. Souvlaki is good enough, as well as falafel. All items are inexpensive.They are very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"This is a halal Greek restaurant in the food court of the very basic Woodside Square mall.

It has all your basic Greek dishes from souvlaki to gyros to baked chicken and spinach and cheese pastry. 

I always go for the gyro wrap.  The meat is always tasty and tender.  It's soooo good with extra tzatziki, extra feta and extra hot sauce. So effin good. I often crave it.

For this wrap, it's just over $5.00.  You can pay here by cash, debit and credit.

Good stuff. I recommend it!!"}
