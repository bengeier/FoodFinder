{"text":"the service is sucks. the woman who has black hair and make up a lot. she was always eating gum when she served us."}
{"text":"Food was okay, but service was the worst I've seen in a while. We came as a large group (7 ppl) for brunch. Some of my friends weren't familiar with how to order their eggs (the terms), so they asked the waitress. She said \"oh boy!\"... while rolling her eyes. What attitude! When we left, she was talking to another employee while pointing at us. Needless to say, she didn't get a tip."}
{"text":"This is the by far the worst allo mon coco that I've ever been to. The both times (once dine in and the other time was takeout) I've been here were horrible. Both times I had extremely slow service when there were barely any people there. I'm never going there especially after my last experience last weekend. I repeated myself 5 times saying I don't want any bacon with my TAKEOUT grilled cheese orders. 15 minutes of waiting, they finally bring my orders saying they included bacon in one of them and I demanded a refund for one of them. The cashier brings out front the so called \"manager\" who was LAUGHING IN MY FACE asking what the problem was. He gave me a refund and and when I leave and open my order at work, the grilled cheese did not have potatoes inside!! (The $5 combo INCLUDES grilled cheese potatoes and a coffee). ALSO they didn't give me any utensils or napkins. I've only went there because it's across my work building. I'm never returning again. Go to the one on de maisonneuve near guy metro. Whenever I go there, they are professional and have excellent service."}
{"text":"The coffee was a little bitter, but the staff was friendly and fast! Hearty breakfast for a beautiful morning in Montreal."}
{"text":"The food is pretty well made. The side potatoes are really good, as well as their steak and egg options. It is quite a large portion of food they provide, so it will make you full.  The pancakes were fairly thick, but are expensive to add as a side. 

The service was good as well. The waitress we had was friendly. My only gripe with their service is if there is a line up out front, it gets very disorganized as they do not make a list. 

Overall the food was good, service was good and it's a nice place to grab breakfast in mtl if you're looking for large portions and food that you're already familiar with."}
{"text":"I went here with my mother last sunday just to check out the new brunch place and we were not disappointed. 
We ordered an omelette and their special: Crepe royale. 
Both were delicious and could have been eaten by 2 people instead of one. The omelette was huge and well made and we liked the potatoes that came with it. The crepe royale - well technically they were pancakes instead of crepes, but we didnt mind - was humongous! Topped with yummy ice cream, fresh strawberries and chocolate syrup.
The server was very friendly and helpful and kept refilling our coffee."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast if you have a big appetite! The service is good and make sure to use the benches that add comfort to your experience at this location. The food is really good with a lot of choices on the menu. The only reason it is not a 5 star is that I find that it is a bit pricey for what you get. When you order they also keep asking you for extras (like maple syrup for 2.95$). I would recommend this place to go once in a while for a big breakfast to start your day well."}
{"text":"If you've read my other reviews, you'll probably realize I'm a person who loves variety. And this is a huge reason why I love Allo Mon Coco so much! Their menu offers a lot of variety and I'm pretty sure can cater to any need, craving and even diet (their healthy menu option is good too!).

I've gone a few times and have yet to be disappointed. You can TELL their pancakes, waffles, crepes are made freshly on the spot (which is why I didn't mind waiting a while for my food). Their eggs are great too, not overly fried or seasoned. I found their meats to be a way too salty though - leaving me thirsty throughout the day. Aside from the salty meat, service is great, the ambiance at this location is also great (heart of downtown) & you really get your moneys worth!"}
{"text":"after a long train ride, a horrendous experience at crescent sushi yesterday, just a generally exhausting day, and a long sleep the first thing on my mind this morning was that i needed to get a good breakfast, i had a look online and found that Allo! Mon Coco was the nearest one, i'd never been and it wasn't a name i'd recognized but i decided to give it ago.

after arriving the service was prudent, seated us immediately and actually came to ask us for our order before we'd decided (not a common thing) the first thing i noticed was the coffee... it was spectacular, not at all what i'd expected and a pleasant surprise, a good sign to say the least.

a few minutes later they brought my full meal, philly steak benedict... boy oh FUCKIN BOY it was absolutely incredible. everything about it was good, the eggs were cooked perfectly, there was just enough steak, the bread was cooked perfectly to be just the right amount of crispy and the seasoning was magnifique. along with the main meal was a side of potatos and a bowl of fruit, also good but a bit of a difficult thing to mess up.

needless to say i'll likely be returning here by the end of my trip, probably for the pancakes next time!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst allo mon coco in all of Quebec, based on service. 
When I walked in and waited in line, no one came to me to ask me how many people we were or my name. When I reached the front of the line, the hostess didn't acknowledge me. The floors were also disgustingly dirty and tables were empty but no cleaned. 
Finally I was seated, after approaching the hostess. 
Once I was seated, the waitress was unfriendly, did not give us utensils even when asked. 
Horrible!!! Worst service ever and very dirty restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice branch place. Usually I share one breakfast combo with my friend because it is a lot of food, enough to make both of us full. Really like the pancake with banana and the milkshake. The only problem is the air conditioner makes it too cold sometimes. The service is also good, he is handsome also nice."}
{"text":"Fresher squeezed OJ, more food than you can eat. Bacon eggs Benedict, potatoes and a fruit cup."}
{"text":"It's your typical brunch chain restaurant .. Like eggspectations .. If you're prepared for that then you're good .. But if you're expecting more then you'll be disappointed .."}
{"text":"For the prices they charge one can do a lot better in the area. Poorly prepared food. I love the food in Montreal, but this place is one place I wish I had avoided. If you like good food go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We haven't been inform that we should pay for coffee, and their coffee didn't even taste good. Apparently somewhere in the bottom of the menu they mentioned that coffee is 1$. The problem was not one dollar coffee , the real problem was the manager's strange attitude for an incredibly low quality coffee and it's bad taste that we should even pay separatly.
So much mash potato, lots of tasteless fruit.
It was like they have so many customers, they just don't care anymore."}
{"text":"This Chocolate Banana Waffle  (CBW) was one awesome , but big servings.  If you are a big eater it's perfect other than that, if two people wants to share it's good.  I couldn't finish.  The staff is great at least our waitress was.  Very clean."}
{"text":"Food was so, so  and service was slow, the waitress looked uninterested and never smiled ,  the front door is impossible to open."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was good. Our waiter was very friendly. Each dish comes with a lot of food. We didn't care for the potatoes, but the eggs, bacon, fruit and crÃªpe were delicious."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here two days in a row. As an American visiting Canada for the first time, I was blown away by this unassuming place in the Underground City. Loads of fresh fruit with many excellent (and huge) breakfast dishes. Excellent service, not crowded. What else could one ask for?"}
{"text":"Came in on a packed weekend brunch time.  They sit you quickly if you're less than 4 people, but they seem understaffed. If you want service after the food arrives, make sure to flag the waiter/waitress down! Either than that, food is good and portions are enormous. Coffee has unlimited refills!"}
{"text":"The food is surprisingly good (those potatoes!), and priced averagely. Although the waiters are generally friendly, they seem stressed and rushed, and the overall service was terribly slow."}
{"text":"Very good food and big portions but it's also pricier than other breakfast places. The service isn't bad overall.

The place could be a bit loud with customers talking in a small place and radio blasting.

Otherwise would recommend."}
{"text":". 
The place is over-crowded, extremely noisy, the staff over-stressed and the food over fatty, greasy and over-priced. If a scene like this appeals to you go for it. I'll be somewhere else for brunch."}
{"text":"Burned out from projects 
I said potato? Then screamed POTATOEEES .
From that moment we rushed to Allo Mon Coco 30 mins before they close. 
Dat late afternoon breakfast. 
My friend ordered an omelette 
I ordered eggs, bacon, ham, sausage (got my protein game here) 
Crepes, toast 
It came with fruits
And the majestic potatoes. 
I needed my daily fruit game, do I asked extra fruits 
Coffee is extra +1$ I believe (not aware :'( ) 
The plate came. Oh lala 
Beautiful. Drizzle the syrup everywhere 
Each potatoes bite tastes like little pieces of heaven. 
I love melons. And they had all kinds of them . Makes me happy. 
We couldn't finish it haha 
Big food coma for the next hours haha 
Definitely coming back for the potatoes. 
If I could get just eggs, meat, potatoes and those slice of melons, I'd be supper happy haha"}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times hoping it would get better, but it doesn't.
 
A few months ago I ordered a buckwheat pancake to have with the rest of my meal. It tasted rancid. I asked if they could make a fresh batch which they brought about 10 minutes later. It tasted identical to the other one. Thankfully I didn't get to pay for it as I couldn't eat it. I suggested they check their buckwheat flour before making another order for someone else.

Another few times the service is quite lacking. The restaurant is 1/4 full, yet getting your order taken only 15 minutes later.

Speaking of being empty: I tried to go for a late lunch with my husband for 2PM on a Tuesday. We get there and they say they are closing and not accepting more customers. They are supposed to close for 4PM. VERY frustrating!!!

I won't be back."}
{"text":"Walked the 20 mins from our hotel to this resto for breakfast. Worth the walk! I ordered the Choco Coco and the serving was ridiculous, but then again, the price is indicative of the meal. The freshly squeezed pink grapefruit juice was exactly that, pulp and all, just the way I like it. Decor could use abit of work but the food makes up for it. Choco Coco...potatoes were tasty, bacon crispy, and eggs not runny. The only set-back was the crepe filled with bananas drizzled with chocolate. The crepe texture and thickness was more pancake than crepe."}
{"text":"Not the best allo mon coco location. I have tried the one in Dix30 and Laval and they are superior in quality compared to this downtown location. The potatoes were just nasty and looked reheated from the day before. 

Cleanliness is also an issue. Where we were sitting, you could see the floors had not been cleaned in months. The wall were dirty with buildup along the edges. I will never come back to this location. Turn back."}
{"text":"Extremely satisfied with the breakfast. Had visited twice , enjoyed the ambience and food. I will keep continuing coming here  . Would recommend to everyone ."}
{"text":"Je trouve les portions trop grosse. Les prix Ã©levÃ© pour un dÃ©jeuner pourrait Ãªtre plus bas en servant des portions raisonnable. Que de gaspillage de nourriture!
C'est bon, le dÃ©cor est beau, mais il faudrait tenir le restaurant plus propre. Le haut des banquettes est vraiment dÃ©goÃ»tant.  Finalement, il ne faut pas se fier Ã  la publicitÃ© parce que le menu avant
8h30 est plus cher qu'annoncÃ©e. Ce n'est qu'une faÃ§on de vous faire entrer!"}
{"text":"Great food, decent prices, pretty good customer service.

I went to this location for breakfast after a night shift, and I got a freshly squeezed orange juice and a \"regular\" eggs benedict. It came with a mountain of fruits along with the rest of the eggs benedict.

When the server brought me the glass of freshly squeezed orange juice, she spilled some of it, so she came back with a napkin, and wiped it up a bit. When I picked up the cup, it still had orange juice on the outside, so I asked for more napkins to wipe my hands and the rest of the cup.

Aside from that, the staff was very friendly, and I didn't sit with my empty plate for too too long. I was very full up to more or less dinner time, so the portion was quite decent.

All-in-all, even though there was some room for improvement in correcting the spilled orange juice situation, I'd likely return to this venue due to everything it did have going for it."}
{"text":"I always get the same fruit cottage cheese with poachEd eggs and bagel.  It's hard to choose another plate when they always make my fav order so well. I'm.never disappointed.  It's always packed but i guess cuz it's just that good the food."}
{"text":"I went here with big group of friends for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. The line was out the door, and we had to wait quite a while, but it was understandable since we had more than 10 people in our group.

So after about a 20 minute wait, we were finally seated. The service was pretty good. The waitress was really nice, and we didn't have to flag her down for water like at most restaurants in Montreal (at least the restaurants I went to). 

After looking over the the menu, I decided to order the \"Lac Saint-Jean\" which is \"2 eggs, bacon, baked beans, cretons, blueberry pancake, potatoes, toast, and fruit\". The portion sizes are HUGE. I could barely finish all my food. The blueberry pancake was about the size of my face, and it was nice and fluffy. The eggs were ordered over-easy and they were cooked to perfection. The bacon was nice and crispy, and the fruit was really good as well.

Overall, this place is a solid brunch place that will have your tummy doing a happy dance. It's better than your average brunch place. The presentation of the food is cool, and they make sure you leave full and happy. So check this place out when you have a chance."}
{"text":"I have to say the service is really slow. I like the food though. The menu changed a few month ago, and I feel it is better than before. Price is acceptable to students. It is one of my favourite place in Montreal"}
{"text":"Allo Mon Coco is my favorite breakfast chain, their food is quite good. My favorite dish is called the coco waffles, which consists of eggs, bacon, a mountain of fruit and of course a big waffle. The staff are polite and knowledgeable. The only knock is that I wish they came around more to refill my coffee. Overall, a solid experience."}
{"text":"Le restaurant manque de chaleur et fraÃ®cheur. Les pommes de terre bonnes mais pas suffisamment chaude. La sauce des Âufs BÃ©nÃ©dicte un peu trop Ã©paisse. Serveur courtois et attentionnÃ©.  Assiette abondante mais constamment dÃ©rangÃ©e par des petites mouches Ã  fruits... Ce n'Ã©tait pas Ã  la hauteur de mes attentes d'un restaurant Ã  dÃ©jeuner"}
{"text":"Wow, there are a lot of bad reviews for this place! Fortunately for me, my experience was satisfactory. My son and I were back from a show on a Saturday morning and I had to go quickly to my office not too far away ... While crossing the food court \"coincidentally\" my little boy got suddenly hungry, AllÃ´ Mon Coco was opened so we tried our luck here. 

We were seated quite quickly but the time it took to get our order was a bit long especially given the few people that were there, however, as soon as the waitress realized her forgetfulness everything came together pretty quickly. I ordered a mocha with Benedictine eggs which tasted very good and my son had a pancake with strawberries and Nutella. We both enjoyed our meal and were happy with our overall experience at this place."}
{"text":"Even though the price range is $$ the portions make it a great value-for-money option. Their moto is making the Sunday fanily brunch interesting and they stick to it, It's a very family and kids place. The place look like a typical American  diner or a Montreal version of Waffle House. The food is very commercial because it's a franchise, the quality is similar to Waffle House. They even charge extra $1 for coffee which is rare in Montreal breakfast places since the coffee is usually complimentary.

I took crab cake egg benedicts and enjoyed it much. Wish the potatoes were more spicy (or if there was an option of asking for tabasco). What wins for me is the fruit bowl (and I am not a fruit person), we ordered English cream to go with and it was fantastic!

The huge downturn was the staff; they have very poor service. The waitline was super slow and not well-attended. I had to ask for glasses of water and for coffee and for every other service because they weren't attending to our table.

Definitely prefer Chez Cora to this."}
{"text":"Assez bon, j'ai toujours bien mangÃ© et le service est quand mÃªme bien. C'est cool qu'il y ait un cafÃ©/thÃ© qui vient gratuit avec le dejeuner. Par contre, le lait/crÃ¨me Ã  notre table n'Ã©taient pas trÃ¨s frais."}
{"text":"Yayy always down for Allo mon coco. Even though it was veryyyy crowded (as usual on sundays), the food was good, they never disappoint."}
{"text":"We were eager to try this new place as it's just strewn the street from us. I'm sad to say it's the worst food I've had at a breakfast place in town.

First I ordered a decaf coffee, everyone else had regular coffee that was obviously piping hot. My decaf (of which no refills were offered until we'd asked for the bill) was tepid, luke warm at best.

Off the menu I ordered two eggs with roast potatoes and a pancakes. The menu inidciated that the meal came with toast and fruit, and I'm sad to say the toast was the best part of the meal.

The \"roast\" potatoes were actually an  incredibly over seasoned mash full of dill, onions, and what tasted like vegetable stock; with the warning that they *may* contain bacon fat.

When I pointed this out to the server she just sort of shrugged, offered no concessions or compensation, and left. 

The scrambled eggs were completely unseasoned and a bit rubbery, but tolerable.

The pancake (which came with no syrup til I asked another server) was essentially like eating a dense, flat, vanilla cake.

I can't stress enough how terrible the potatoes and pancakes were, especially if you're expecting hash browns or actual roast potatoes (as the menu indicates in both English and French)

On the way out I told the hostess about these issues and again, no compensation was offered. I doubt I'd ever go back here."}
{"text":"All around just ok but too expensive. Much better options at a better price to chose from in the area."}
{"text":"We went in before the big line up Saturday around 11 am. The restaurant was already packed. The service is fine. Not too slow. The portion has diminished though (potatoes)... This is my 3rd visit, the potatoes were more salty than my last visit. I like this chain of brunch. I also go to the one at Marche Central and the one on Ste-Catherine Street. I like their menu, variety of pancakes and I love the table d'hote during weekdays. You will be full for sure with the table d'hote I often bring left overs."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the potatoes, they are way too mashed and seasoned with some powder mix of sorts. The pancakes (usually a massive portion) and eggs are alright, while other additions like breakfast sausages and bacon are average. 

It's a shame that this location isn't up to par with all the 'allo! mon coco' hype, I was looking forward to its opening since it's in my area and I thought it'd maybe be better than Eggspectations or Universel... but, nope."}
{"text":"It was my first time in Montreal and I was staying at the Le Meridien nearby. I asked the concierge for a good breakfast place and this place was only a 2 minute walk from the hotel. I went in and the ambience was nice and bright - which is perfect for the morning. the waiter was extremely nice and I ordered what I thought was a small breakfast, but boy was it big! I couldn't finish the whole thing, but but it was very good."}
{"text":"I really like the food here! The place is large, bright and clean. There is a huge selection of breakfast options (maybe too large!) to choose from, so the only problem is deciding what to have. Portions are large so you won't leave hungry. The only drawback is that the quality of service varies drastically depending on the server.
The Choco Coco has a great thin pancake/thick crepe wrapper stuffed with fresh banana and plenty of good chocolate sauce. Add the bacon or sausages and eggs and their tasty potatoes and what a way to start the day! Or you can go with the Sunshine, which has the same wrap but is stuffed with fresh fruit - strawberries and melon - instead. The Portobello Omelet is full of nice portobello mushrooms, but also has prosciutto and Oka cheese to put it over the top. The Gourmet Eggs Benedict comes with mushrooms and brie cheese as well and it is super!
I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"pretty nice decent food , can get a bit crowded during weekends but that's expected as its on a busy street, not ideal for the pennysaver as its fairly expensive but enormous portions(12eggs=1omlette) which in most cases ends up being leftover or wasted, service is alright, sometimes waiters are a bit rude especially during rush hour"}
{"text":"This is very good spot near my home. I think it's the best place to get breakfast in La Salle. The portions are very generous so make sure you are hungry when you go there. Staff is friendly and environment is spacious and clean. The food is satisfying."}
{"text":"I'm turned off to this franchise after my visit to this location today. My order came 10 mins after my girlfriends and the bacon that came with it looked repulsive. I applaud the waitress for being apologetic and taking 10% off the bill, but that doesn't take away from this being a bad experience."}
{"text":"my sisters and i went for a marriage shower on may 6 2018 and we found the service excellent. the manager martine and the waitress stephanie were very courteous sweet and professional. the servive was very fast considering we were about 20 people. i had the egg benedict with the crab cake excellent and the potatoes and a plate of fruit and the price was excellent. by the way, i tried 4 other allo mon coco one in terrebebonne and they did not have the same service of menu  and the plates are smaller. thanks martine for everything. fanny  5 stars"}
{"text":"Went there today with some of my coworkers. We were early enough to get the early bird special and with those you get a great value for your money. Service was decent. Not too long and friendly. The food was adequate. Not the best food but not the worse one either. I had a cheese omelette and it was with kraft cheese but the taste was good. No reasons to comply."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, and the service is usually great. However, I had a bad experience today. Our waitress (not sure of name, but she was petite with dark hair in a pony tail), needs coaching when it comes to treating clients. She never brought us the water we requested even though she was walking around with a pitcher. Also, we felt she was rushing our meal. We were still eating when she asked us if it would be one bill or two. Then she made us pay even though we were not finished our meal. Never asked us if we wanted anything else. We told her we felt rushed and she gave us an excuse that she was closing her tables. Usually I would understand, however we noticed that she did not do that to her other tables that finished after us. We felt like we were treated poorly because we were white because she only did this to us and the other tables were not. I'm so disappointed. Imagine eating your toast and they want you to put your food down and pay. The other waitress that helped in our section was different. She assisted us when we needed something and we were happy with her."}
{"text":"I've heard good reviews about this franchise through many friends. This branch is closest to my house, so I decided to try it out instead of the ones downtown. 

Service:

It was 12pm on a Saturday and it was packed. Very nice ambiance and decorations. We were seated by a hostess who wasn't welcoming at all. No smiles and no greetings. Just \"how many people?\" 

We were seated at the booth near the entrance to the kitchen, where waitresses and waiters rushed back and forth. We expected better service seeing as we were seated where we were visible by every passing server. After sitting for 20 mins without first contact, I was finally offered coffee. There weren't any utensils on the table for me to stir my coffee with so it went cold after 10 mins when the waitress returned to take our order (finally). The couple beside us ate, got their bill, paid and left within the 20 mins because the waitress tended them instead of us. 

Food:

Normally, from past brunching experiences, the plates should arrive at the same time. My boyfriend ordered a breakfast poutine which came before mine and was cold. I asked to send it back to be reheated. 

When my avocado Benedict came, it was presented beautifully. Very nice portions, though the Benedict wasn't anything out of the ordinary. The big bowl of fruits was probably the highlight of my overall experience. 

In the end, very disappointing experience for us. Won't come back again but will probably try other branches just to be sure. I still tipped the waitress 15% because she was very nice and smiley."}
{"text":"This place is known for generous portions ! I definitely have enough food for 2 breakfasts. Nothing particularly good it's a breakfast chain so I don't have any high expectations. I would say the breakfast potatoes are pretty amazing !!!"}
{"text":"Being allergic to kiwi means that I'm generally at a disadvantage when it comes to breakfast and bunch spots since kiwi is almost always used in fruit bowls. To make sure that no contamination occurred, I stay away from all fruit. I normally don't mind too much but the fruit bowls were so adorably done that it made it a little bit sad I couldn't have any. 
What I did have: coffee and the eggs Benedict with potatoes instead of the fruit. Coffee was included in the price of the meal I believe so that was appreciated. Our server kept the refills coming as I chatted with a friend I hadn't seen in a long time, so we didn't feel at all rushed. My meal was more than satisfactory, the eggs were perfectly poached and the hollandaise sauce wasn't too heavy. The potatoes were kind of like a hash-style, and apparently people like them with cheese but I went without because I wanted to try them nude. I couldn't finish them all, but they were well seasoned. 
I'd go back again to try out some other dishes, everyone seemed to be enjoying their food."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. We were 30 minutes ahead and there was no line. Our friends were arriving at quarter past, so we asked if we should wait in line for a table for 6. They did not tell us that they wouldn't seat the table until the whole group arrived. After everyone but one person arrived, they told us they wouldn't seat us after waiting for 45 minutes. They proceeded to seat several 5-6 person parties that arrived after us. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Sooooooooooo disappointed. I was so exited about a new breakfast place opening in the neighborhood, and I was thoroughly let down. 

Points to note:
-*Roast* potatoes (as listed on the menu) are not the same as overly salted and dill-filled lumpy mush potatoes (and I usually LOVE salt, dill and mush more than most).
-Decaf coffee and regular coffee should be served at the same (hot) temperature.
-Pancakes should not be glue-y messes.
-Eggs shouldn't be rubbery.
-Everything is an \"extra\" (coffee was not included etc...)
-$20 is too much to pay for a good plate of eggs, much less a sh***y one.
-Even if your server doesn't speak your language, they should be gracious about it. Especially in a Anglo-heavy neighborhood like the Concordia ghetto.
- Restaurants should offer you something as compensation for mistakes or lousy food, not make excuses or justifications.
-There was almost nothing on the menu my vegan friend could eat, in-buttered toast and fruit just about covered it. Even the potatoes said \"may contain lard\". 

I would give this no stars if I could, or even negative stars. NEVER going back again.

Only positive: the fruit bowl was beautiful, expensive, and beautiful."}
{"text":"I came in starving and I just wanted a nice breakfast. Turns out I was very unsatisfied with my meal, toast was burnt and stale felt like it was left on the counter for 15 years and everything apart from pancake  on my plate (eggs potato and bacon) and was lukewarm... experience was not great but I left with a full stomach thankfully. Maybe just a one time thing but cmon"}
{"text":"Worse place ever!!!
After they seated me in a corner, I finally got served (after 7 minutes with no water and nobody to see me).
Potatoes where disgusting with plenty of oil, I requested toast white and they gave me brown ones
Coffee is bad and on top they charge 1$ for it, besides my basic eggs. They never brought my French toasts but they had charged for them.
16$ plus taxes for 2 eggs, potato, bacon, wrong toast and a coffee; and a very long and bad service!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice place!!cleaned,and the service is fast!very friendly!!i will back !cause here is very close to my home!!"}
{"text":"It gets 4 stars from me because as a breakfast diner it matches up to my egg-spectations (egg-scuse the puns!). The place is bright and cheery and pretty spacious.  Considering there's no other breakfast place nearby this one could stand to do well being literally next door to all the high-rise apartments.  Sure, it's not the trendy, hipster place for breakfast but the convenient location makes up for it.  The food is made quick and the portions are large enough to eat half and take the rest to go. A coffee or tea is included with every meal.  Bring parents and kids to this place and it's fine. I personally find the red booth seats quite invigorating to look at and it just wakes you up after sitting a while. Breakfast wait staff tend to be quite pleasant I find, nothing to complain about on my first visit."}
{"text":"First time at this chain. Reserved for a group of 14 at noon. Arrived on time and it took them 15 minutes to seat us despite having a reservation.   Everybody ordered coffee, and other drinks on the side (beer, mimosas, milk shakes...) however not everyone got a coffee even after repeated reminders and the alcohol came for some 45 minutes later. My meal (steak and cheese eggs Benedict) came an hour after sitting down! The eggs weren't runny but at this point I'm so hungry I don't complain.  My colleague ordered their specialty: potatoes gratinÃ©. However the cheese was cold on the cold potatoes. $3 for \"melted\" cheese!  He brought this up to the waitress and she said the steam from potatoes is supposed to melt it. BUT IT DIDN'T!  No apologies. At this point most are ready to pay and get the hell out since we've already wasted 90 minutes in this place. When she took my plate I expressed my disappointment that the eggs were overcooked and she didn't seem to care. 
The food: not bad. Generous fruit bowls. Potatoes are good. Would be better if the cooked them longer to have crispy edges. Menu has a good variety. Too bad staff isn't trained to put the customer first. I'll never be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Not bad. Huge portions of food. Priced decent. Courteous staff. Rather quick delivery of food which is always a plus. My friend couldn't finish his Poutine but hey they asked him if he wanted to take it home but he said no."}
{"text":"Tucked into the underground food court at 1 Place Ville-Marie Long. 

Huge portions, great value. Buttery pancakes, seasoned potatoes, crisp bacon, greasy sausage. Fruit portions are big and nicely presented. Coffee is adequate to decent. Delicious artery-clogging breakfast goodness at excellent prices. Long waits during lunch. Come early or prepare to wait. Staff are harried, hurried, doing their best. It's a tough gig and they do okay. Would return, if I were in the area and could take a slightly longer lunch that day!

Pro tip: Check jam bowl for \"Grenache\" caramel spread (see picture) and add to your pancakes, very Montreal & very nice! Also: I am no slouch at eating, but one breakfast platter is more food than a normal sized person can eat, no joke. Prepare for food coma."}
{"text":"I've seen some reviews and frankly, I don't get them. If you're looking for a place for a coffee and a bagel this is not the place for you.

But if you're fora big meal at a reasonable cost with children, friends or a big family I think this does the job very well.

My son and I ordered smoothies that were both very good with eggs Benedict. The plates were big, we'll filled with very fresh fruits and awesome potatoes.

Service was fast and good. We weren't in the busiest time of the day, but hey, go during low tides and all will be fine. I'm sure earlier in the morning things are rock and roll, but hats the price to pay.

So all and all a good place for that \"American oversized meal\". And I don't mean that in a bad way."}
{"text":"Aucune indication que la place est fermÃ© le dimanche, ce qui nous fait un dÃ©placement et un stationnement pour rien ici. Chapeau."}
{"text":"We went on the Thanksgiving Day so there's a line up but the turn over was pretty fast so we had our table within 15 minutes. We ordered the weekend special and the waitress was super friendly and attentive. She urges us to share one portion when we asked if that's enough since we always order too much for brunch and it ended up that the portion was just good and we didn't feel overeating. Overall, it was an excellent experience and we will definitely come back."}

{"text":"PremiÃ¨re fois Ã  cet endroit, le personnel est trÃ¨s aimable, le dÃ©cor est un peu trop pop Ã  mon goÃ»t pour une place Ã  petits dÃ©jeuners 
+ les portions sont trÃ¨s gÃ©nÃ©reuses pour le prix, et c'est trÃ¨s raisonnable 
+ les pommes de terres servies avec les petits dÃ©jeuner sont bien assaisonnÃ©s et assez bonnes
+ le cafÃ© est correct

- la prÃ©sentation des assiettes est assez grossiÃ¨re, des traces de doigts sur le rebord des assiettes et des marques de fruits rouges sur les pots de salade de fruit, des Ã©lÃ©ments inutiles tel que des morceaux de salade dans une salade de fruit pour dÃ©corer ..
- des petits intrus nous dÃ©rangeait durant le repas (des petits moucherons)
- un trÃ¨s gros manque d'assaisonnement pour tout Ã  part les pommes de terre (oeuf BÃ©nÃ©dicte, sauce hollandaise, viande..)

En rÃ¨gle gÃ©nÃ©rale je conseil cet endroit, les petits dÃ©jeuners sont en moyenne trÃ¨s bons, vu que la place est assez rÃ©cente ca serai bien qu'ils s'amÃ©liorent pour la prÃ©sentation et l'assaisonnement. Bonne journÃ©e !"}
{"text":"Overall the food is good and the prices are solid. Service is a whole other story. It might have just been an off day, but service was slow, sloppy, and just hampered the overall experience. Plus, finding avocado pits in my omelette wasn't fun."}
{"text":"Surprising find, situated as it is on the edge of a big-box shopping centre. Delicious omelette, croque monsieur, and definitely try the breakfast potatoes. Very nice interior, outside looked good too. Great, friendly service."}
{"text":"After going back a second time I was not as impressed with the service. After noticing the menu said the potatoes may contain traces of bacon fat my friend asked the waitress what this meant. The waitress said the potatoes contained small bits of bacon fat. I told the waitress Ive had the potatoes and I am a vegetarian and the menu should state it does contain bacon. She looked confused and didn't seem to care. After that we noticed our waitress tended to her other customers cheerfully and hardly said two words to us. Definitely disappointed."}
{"text":"Despite a bit of a line, we were seated quickly. Atmosphere was bright and busy. High ceiling means it wasn't too noisy even with the Sunday morning crowd. Food came quickly. Pretty standard fare, not spectacular but satisfying. Did have to ask for both water and cutlery so there were a few kinks in the system. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"I would like to start off by saying that I'm extremely impressed with my waiter, Ronny, from an overall excellent experience. 

Right from the start, the hostess took up names from the people in line to make sure we felt taken care of. Even though the restaurant was full the great management made it so that I obtained a seat seconds after walking in, the line moving very quickly.

Ronny came and took alatte bowl order. My drink was made instantly even though the barista, whom I was seated in front of, had multiple bill orders. I noticed she had a clear work order and ethic and was impressed with how she managed her time and movements. She also kept her work station extremely clean and desinfected after each task !! The only downside was that I think original Allo Mon Coco recipe for a latte bowl requires two shots of espresso but your bowls are very big, compared to standard hotel cutlery, so the latte tasted a bit diluted.

Afterwards, Ronny came to take my order and my food came promptly. Being seated at the bar, I noticed that Ronny made sure that all the tables were taken care of adequately and that he would notice small details before the client would have to ask for them, such as syrup or ketchup. I also noticed his communication skills with the other waitresses and his overall kindness and will to give a great customer experience. Let's all be reminded that the restaurant was at full capacity and even with the high pressure of the load of clients, I always felt welcomed. 

Having been a breakfast waitress myself, I must admit that I would have much enjoyed working in this environment. An overall great tuesday morning for me !"}
{"text":"As usual this place amazes me with the quality of food. Fresh fruits and big pancakes. Their English cream is just mouthwatering and makes you eat more and more of it. 
Kids love this place. We always go there for breakfast and we always take the rest with us as the quantity is huge. Good energizing breakfast doe a long working day. Happy breakfast. :)"}

{"text":"I'm sorry that others have had such a bad experience here but we had a solid breakfast and our service was on point, our waitress crushed it, we were in need of not and she got us out quickly so we could catch our choo choo train. Look at those over easy eggs, perfection there is not a sign of crispy around the edge.  Fresh squeezed OJ was what I expected, pulpy and sunshiny.  Pancakes had a little chew which I like.  Bacon, yummy (duh).  Sausage, smokey but not the type I'm used to south of the border, still good.  Ham, it's ham.  Brown toast, perfectly toasted and buttery.  Coffee, not bad for a chain, black and rich like I like my coffee.  The only thing at issue for me is the way they do their taters, I like home-fries or hash browns, these are rich and creamy which wasn't a big deal it's just not my thing.  All in all we left with full bellies and smiles on our faces."}

DÃ©Ã§ue par cette succursale: expÃ©rience trÃ¨s moyenne malgrÃ© toute la douceur de la serveuse qui nous appelle \"ma chÃ©rie\" et \"ma belle\" ma copine et moi. Ãa prend un moment avant qu'on vienne nous voir, l'eau que nous avons demandÃ©e arrive longtemps aprÃ¨s le cafÃ©, on ne me demande pas quel type de pain je veux, puis quand mon assiette arrive, on se rend compte qu'il y manque quelques Ã©lÃ©ments...

J'ai commandÃ© des oeufs bÃ©nÃ©dictine avec oignons caramÃ©lisÃ©s et saucisses (menu spÃ©cial du weekend). Le pain et les saucisses Ã©taient froids et le reste Ã©tait tiÃ¨de. Les patates, toujours excellentes, avaient heureusement une tempÃ©rature potable. Le rÃ©chaud de cafÃ© s'est fait attendre longtemps. 

Quand la serveuse m'a demandÃ© si tout Ã©tait Ã  mon goÃ»t, j'avais dÃ©jÃ  presque terminÃ© mon assiette, alors j'Ã©tais mal placÃ©e pour me plaindre. Je retournerai chez Allo mon Coco, mais pas Ã  cette succursale."}

{"text":"Nous avions entendus des bons commentaires sur cette chaÃ®ne, mais nous avons Ãªtes trÃ¨s dÃ©Ã§us de notre expÃ©rience.

J'ai commandÃ© une omelette portobello, prosciutto et fromage Oka. Le goÃ»t Ã©tait terrible car il y avait vraiment trop de champignons et le prosciutto Ã©tait abondant et en tranches complÃ¨tes (non coupÃ©) ce qui rendait l'omelette difficile Ã  couper, mais surtout j'avais l'impression de manger une tranche de prosciutto avec une orgie de champignons. De plus, ce n'Ã©tait pas du fromage Oka, mais du mozzarella.

Par ailleurs, les portions sont gigantesques. Je prÃ©fÃ©rerais payer moins pour avoir une portion raisonnable 

La cerise sur le sundae, un service froid et peu courtois ou il faut se battre pour attirer l'attention de la serveuse pour avoir la facture et partir au plus vite de ce restaurant mÃ©diocre. Jamais la serveuse n'est venue nous voir pendant le service pour nous demander si tout allait bien. Il y a tellement de restos dÃ©jeuner de meilleur qualitÃ©.

{"text":"I had a delicious breakfast here. While other restaurants in the area are quite pricey, this definitely worked for me. Good food and good service!"}
{"text":"The place had a friendly environment. The service was great and every single dish on the menu is satisfaction guaranteed. The food is well made and the presentation is nice."}
{"text":"I'm torn.

The service (Hao) was great! He was nice, quick, informative (like assisting in trying to find my gluten-intolerant friend a dish so that ordering a bunch of individual parts wouldn't cost her double the price) but still a salesman (offered the potatoes to be gratin for mine). He was quick with our check and polite the whole way through.

The food however left me torn. The potatoes were delicious and the serving of fruits was larger than normal (and included 9 different fruits!). Sadly, my eggs Benedict was overcooked, one hard boiled and one half cooked, which really kills the beauty of an eggs Benedict. The thing that finalized the sour taste was our bills. I don't mind paying $14+tax/tip for breakfast, but when you tack on an extra $1.00 for coffee/tea you go down a peg or two in my books. Minus one star for not being able to cook your namesake, and another for charging on something that I've never had to pay for with breakfast."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch place! Beware that the quantity is a lot for one person so you could share! The only thing that they could improve is to tell how many eggs would be in the Omlett (six) it's expensive but worth it if you are eating good and can share or take it home."}
{"text":"I heard that AllÃ´ Mon Coco had good potatoes so that got my attention. 

We walked in on a Friday morning at 9:45 and were able to get seats right away.  Normally, on weekends there are lineups. By the time we were done, at around 10:30, there were about a dozen people waiting in line to get a table! 

We ordered the Good Morning and the Coco Waffle De Luxe. 

They were right! The potatoes were real gooood. Something like refried potatoes cause it comes in a pile of semi mash which doesn't look appealing but taste great cause it has that fried potato taste. 

Apart from that, my scrambled eggs were kind of weird, stringy and greasy so it wasn't very impressed with that. The waffle was decent, a little \"bready\". I tasted my neighbour's cinnamon roll and it was also bready but decent as well

Overall, I'd say it's not a bad choice of breakfast place if you've nowhere hipstery to go to :)  However, it is a chain resto though so it operates like a \" Chez Cora\"."}
{"text":"Here's the thing about breakfast places.  Either you're going for a unique and authentic dining experience or you're going for the resto-chain experience.   When I go in, I'm fully expecting a franchised experience I so take everything with a grain of salt. 

I heard about their potatoes and being potato fan that I am, I was interested in trying them out.  Happily, when I had them the first and second time, I was quite satisfied with them.  They're like refried mashed potatoes.  There's that nice pan fried aroma and flavor that satisfies the junk foodie in me and the comfort of warm mashed potatoes.  I even ordered just a plate of potatoes once!  What I appreciate is that the waitress didn't look at me weird when I asked for just a plate of potatoes with a tea for breakfast. (I had a light breakfast at home and was just accompanying a friend by ordering a plate.) 

Are there lineups? Yes (I've never had to wait).  
Noisy? Yes (especially if there's a birthday person).  
Service a hit-or-miss? Yes (for me it's been ok). 
Pricey? Yes (I think I can do better for that price).

But it's a convenient place to hit up in the area cause Saint-Leonard doesn't really have any good breakfast place in the vicinity so I won't complain.  If you want, McD's is right across the parking lot!

Another time, I ordered just a fresh fruit cup. It's quite filling! Also just a touch expensive.  It was $7.95 but with tax and tip comes to about $10ish...so yeah, that's a little steep for a dozen grapes, 3 strawberries, 1 blackberry, half a banana, slice of honeydew, slice of cantaloup, half slice of grapefruit, slice of cactus pear, 2 quarter slices watermelon, slice of kiwi and one very sour slice of piney apple. 

Saturday and Sundays only offer the breakfast menu. Lunch menu only offered during weekdays."}
{"text":"I seriously wish we had one of these in Toronto! This is up there with one of my favourite breakfast places. 

Pros:
- Food: The food here is so good! Large portions and I felt like I ate my money's worth. Most of the entrees come with breakfast potatoes and toast (The Strawberry Waffles did not). I love the option choices because you can get savoury and/or sweet on one plate. The potatoes here are so bomb! Not to try and full of flavour. 
- Service: The service was great. We were seated quickly around 10-11am and our server was great. We told her that it was our first time there and she took the time to ask us what we were craving and recommend us what most people liked. 
- Quality: I would say that the quality of food here is great. It's not like other breakfast places that just have a standard menu, but they have so many options. Everything that our friends got was also great as well. 
- Price: I think the price is great for the quality food and portions size. The portions are hearty so be sure to go in with a large appetite!

Cons:
- Parking: Unfortunately, no parking spaces at this location. 

Foods/Drinks I like:
- Allo Mon Coco Crepe
- Strawberry Fusion Waffles"}
{"text":"I was searching for a place near my hotel for breakfast food, and wow! Does Allo Mon Coco fit the bill!!! 

I did not have a negative experience here, as some seem have had. However, I could see how some may view service as being a little \"slow\". But I would not characterize it as slow. The servers are all very good, and they are very sensitive to what you are doing as they pass by your table. I noticed that they did not interrupt conversations, or if someone was doing something on a computer or tablet, the server came back when the time looked like it would not be an interference. So, my water and coffee cups did go empty for a couple minutes, but everything was simply leisurely. So, I would say, that if you are looking for \"fast\" food, this is not your place.

This place IS, however; a place you go to enjoy your food. Every single bit of it. The portions are large, and all of it seems very fresh. If breakfast food is your favorite food, the menu will cause you to have an anxiety attack because it is a fantastic selection. I am a \"traditional\" breakfast kind of guy, but their creativity made it easy to try something I may not have tried back home in the States. And I am glad that I did. 

I only give a 5 star when I cannot think of even one minor complaint. 
I now have the food trifecta here in Montreal. Where I will be spending quite bit of time for work. I have a favorite dinner spot, last week I found my lunch spot; and today, I found my favorite breakfast spot. 

The location is one street off of Saint Catherine, so it is easy to get there. It is a somewhat non-descript building. So look for the sign. 

You will be glad that you did."}
{"text":"That was a hearty breakfast to fulfill a hungry person.  The best of the omelette is with very fresh ingredients. Don't miss their Tuscan style."}
{"text":"My go to breakfast stop. Great menu selection. My favourite hands down is the eggs Benedict! Not only do you get a side of thier amaaaaaaazinng potatoes (did I mention you can add cheese on them too?!) but you also get a very generous portion of fruit. I also enjoy their \"pick 2 pick 3 etc\" item option allowing you to really get what you want for breakfast."}
{"text":"Some harsh reviews so far! I came here this week and had an experience very similar to my experiences in laval's locations. I had my usual 2 eggs and sausage, which I understand is not the most complex dish, but still, it was exactly what I expected and got. And it was just fine. 

I actually like their potato mash. It has a signature taste and texture that I associate with this specific breakfast resto, and I look forward to having it each time. 

Minus one star because they charge for coffee. I get that it's downtown, but come on - it's coffee."}
{"text":"Jules won't be back!  Large portions of not very tasty food.  Tasteless bagel served untoasted.  Diner next to me asked for real maple syrup and they brought her a substitute, and she had to ask again.  I had to request a glass of water and a coffee refill.  15 minutes to pay after getting the check."}
{"text":"Quand j'ai dit que je voulais prendre mon petit dej dehors, je pensais Ã  un petit cafÃ© ou jus frais avec un croissant ou pain au chocolat mais c'est chez AllÃ´ mon coco que j'ai atterri. 
A part le service et le personnel que j'ai apprÃ©ciÃ©, le reste bof, ambiance cantine, les \"Â petit dejÂ \" sont trÃ¨s/trop copieux, et pour le prix, on ne veut pas gÃ¢cher. J'ai pris des Âufs BÃ©nÃ©dicte avec saumon sur muffin anglais et sa sauce hollandaise, c'Ã©tait correct sans plus mÃªme si le saumon fumÃ© n'a pas de goÃ»t, je pense que les pommes de terres sont cuites avec l'huile des bacons, car mÃªme si mon plat n'en avait pas, je pouvais le sentir/goÃ»ter et c'Ã©tait Ã©cÂurant. J'y retournerai pas mais au moins j'ai essayÃ©."}
{"text":"I don't know why all the negative reviews, but I ate here twice while visiting a friend just up the street. The first time I had an omelet with smoked sausage, onion and cheese. It was delicious. Now, let me tell you, I am used to paying $6 for an omelet, toast and potatoes so I was a little concerned about the $14 price tag for breakfast, however when my plate arrived I was happy to see that its a LOT of food, and it was really good. 

My next breakfast here was huge. I am huge too so I giggled a little when I almost (keyword: almost) couldn't finish my plate. I got some sort of special which came with a banana pancake and it was really very delicious. Even at $15! (As I said, these kinds of specials and foods cost about half where I live). 

Everyone hates on their potatoes, but I actually really liked them. They are different and unique from other breakfast places and are spiced nicely. The problem with many breakfast places is that they don't spice their potatoes at all and AMC seems to do a great job with it. 

Just beware, the portions are HUGE and this is coming from a huge guy."}
{"text":"Omelette was good. Fruit was mainly fine considering most if not all of the fruit is not in season. The service was absolutely terrible. Our waitress came to check on us once during the meal. We had to wait about half an hour for our bill once we were done. It's like she disappeared entirely. Not at all impressed considering the place is staffed quite highly."}
{"text":"Barely Benedict... I'll give it to them, the fruit bowl was pretty amazing, and even the coffee really hit the spot. But the breakfast potatoes were like a strange potato salad? Pretty disappointing, but the service was excellent."}
{"text":"The best brunch potatoes EVER. Seriously, never had better brunch potatoes anywhere in Montreal. OK their food is good, but I go solely for the potatoes cuz its just that good (its also one of their major points of uniqueness from other brunch places). I also bring someone along just so I can steal their potatoes (shhh don't tell em that). 

Portions are very generous and well priced. They also have amazing fruit waffles and crÃªpes. I used to go here probably once a week...trying to cut down on my addiction XD

PS if you don't like mashed potatoes or mashed potato-esque food then you probably won't enjoy it as much as I do"}
{"text":"Horrible service. I've gone there a few times because I work nearby and hope everytime that the service has improved from the last time, however the service is consistently bad. Takes long to be seated even if half the restaurant is empty. Takes forever to get food. Comes in different parts ..One time, my eggs got cold by the time I got my toast (15 min apart) and waitress had the nerve to say \"you mean you didn't start eating your eggs?\". She then takes my credit card without giving me my receipt..I paid and asked if could see my receipt. The receipt she gave me included a tip already. I asked her about it and she explained that she gave my bill to someone else because she ordered the same thing but that the amount was correct. 

On another occasion I got my food so late (took 40 min) I asked her to pack it instead...3 components of my meal were missing. She went to get them. I said what about the fruit? Is that just decorative? She answered yes (??) but if I wanted some she'd get me some. Yes please!!!! 

I think I've said enough. I signed up to yelp to write this review."}
{"text":"Been there several time, didn't knew they open a breakfast restaurant in that location. The staff are amazing and very great service. The interior is beautiful with the colours makes you smile. The variety of breakfast and lunch are amazing. Good price and great ambiance."}
{"text":"I gotta say - AllÃ´ Mon Coco surprised me. With an extensive menu, cheap coffee, and diner aesthetic - it's hard to find fault with this branch of a regional chain. I followed the advice of my friend and got Eggs Benedict with Avocado price. Soon later, a hefty array of food arrived with no only my eggs, but also fruit and potatoes. In totality, the food was good but nothing fantastic and life changing. If you're in Montreal for a quick stop - don't go but if one is a local craving quick and relatively affordable diner food - they will not leave AllÃ´ Mon Coco disappointed."}
{"text":"The place is full of fruit flies even in october. Service is crap. We asked to take our leftover to go, the waitress came to our table with a take out box and left. She obviously saw our table was already full, with 3 plates and 2 coffees on a small square table. We wanted to pay and had to wait 15 min AT the cash with 3 employee standing there and saying \" just wait for your waitress\"."}
{"text":"Generous portions, lots of cheese on everything. Yum! 

Caroline are waitress was nice and efficient and made an effort to speak in English to us. (Always a plus!)
 
Great location with lots of sunlight. 
Nice patio outside. 

Four stars only because the very friendly hostess, didn't make an effort to speak to us in English, however she was very sweet and friendly.  (Not mandatory to speak England but always a plus in my books! It's just nice to have that option! )"}
{"text":"It was a very ordinary breakfast. Nothing special. For the price they charge I would have at least expected better quality food. The breakfast sausages were below average kind of quality. More like the rejected parts of the pig along with mostly fat all mashed up together. This reiterates the reason why I am leaning more towards a vegan diet."}
{"text":"The food has large portion and was delicious, the potato and English cream was amazing. But the fruit is not fresh and doesn't have good quality.Service is nice and quick, but kinda official, and they are always rushing you... A little annoying for a slow pace lazy Sunday morning"}
{"text":"This is the best brunch in town hands down. Fast, good, big, polite waitress, clean, AWESOME."}
{"text":"The restaurant is good and the menu has many choices to choose from and plus, it's near where I live. The service is good and this place can be pretty popular on the weekends. 

I also like the coffee here. It's not bad like the coffee at A&W nearby. The portions on each plate is pretty generous and the layout inside the building is nice. Plus the staff seems friendly and attentive.

I like the omelettes here."}
{"text":"Great place to stop buy for brunch or breakfast. Food are generously served and delicious too. Can order takeout if you just need a good meal during your break at work. Totally a recommandation."}
{"text":"This is the downtown version of a popular breakfast franchise that started in Laval. The menu is largely consistent with what you would expect in a typical breakfast chain in QuÃ©bec although they do add their own twist. The portion sizes are quite large, and they seem to use fairly high quality ingredients. In the dishes we ordered this was most evident in the quality of the fruits, the bacon and the side of beans. We also liked the crÃªpe with fruit and custard (crÃ¨me anglaise). We did not try their specialty coffees, but the drip coffee they serve is quite decent. 

The location is bright, spacious and generally quite pleasant and the staff were courteous and efficient. Overall this is this is a very good option if you are in the area and looking for a Montreal breakfast chain experience. They do have a lunch menu as well but we have not tried it."}
{"text":"I was excited to have a breakfast place open up so close to my apartment because on a lazy weekend morning I wouldn't have to venture far for brunch.  I have to say though that allo! mon coco isn't all it's cracked up to be.  They have lineups but they deal with them quickly.  It's just everything else after that left a lot to be desired.

Portions are gigantic and in my opinion they're too big.  I can usually finish what I order in a brunch place but here I just can't.  I'm also not a fan of their potatoes.  The seasoning is overpowering and they're too mushy for breakfast potatoes.   The pancakes are fluffy though and I did like those quite a bit.  Everything else (eggs and breakfast meats) were on par for an average brunch place.

Service wasn't great either.  We ordered coffee as soon as we sat down but they didn't bring us cutlery with it so we had no spoons to stir in milk and sugar.  We had to flag our waitress down for basics like water and they were quite slow to bring us the bill.

Honestly even though the restaurant is so close to my apartment I'm not sure if I'd come back here anytime soon.  I was left quite underwhelmed by the whole experience and if I just walk a little farther to the Atwater market area I know I'll find cheaper and better brunch places."}
{"text":"I had to re-write this review with more detail after realizing how many 1-2 star reviews there are here--whaaaaat? This is among my favorite breakfasts in Montreal. You get an incredible amount of food, so come hungry or be sure to have room in your fridge for leftover potatoes. 

The freshly squeezed OJ goes for about $5, but my god is it worth it. You get a large glass and it's so bright and refreshing. It's a huge pain to make at home, so it's always a treat to have. The coffee is pretty standard, and every so often I'll instead get a tasty espresso-based drink. All the food is delicious, although the fruit is better when it's in-season (no surprise there). My favorite is the French toast. I went with a picky friend who ordered nothing but French toast, and they served it with the most glorious mountain of whipped cream.

And those potatoes! Fluffy, flavorful, hot. I've taken them home before, and they reheat very well in the oven, with some crumbled leftover bacon. You also get plenty of toast with nearly every order, and they have a lovely selection of jams and spreads (marmalade being my favorite).

I try to avoid the busiest hours, because even when I go during the week in the late morning, they're very full. That said, I've always had excellent service (Dave is the best!!)--friendly, attentive, and quick. Sometimes you have to flag your server for the bill when it's packed, but I've never had a problem with that."}
{"text":"I was with my friend, we spent $50 (tips included) on our brunch, which is a bit expensive!
I ordered something with 2 pancakes, eggs, and fruits. The waitress asked me if i want honey for my pancake. I said i dont need but end up she gave me the honey and also charged me $3 for it!!
Foods are good as what we expected!
Good location! Just the opposite side of metro St. Mathieu!"}
{"text":"Potatoes were cold and not good, asked for them to heat the potatoes, he said he ll bring me a new plate. It wasnt cold but still didnt taste good at all. Im not a picky eater, my friend isnt either. We tried our best, put some salt, ketchup...cuz we were hungry. Ended up eating eggs and toasts with p&j

Service was good. Food was bad. Wont go there again."}
{"text":"We arrived with a party of 7 at noon today, waited for 30 minutes. When we arrived at our table, an argument broke out between two of the employees as to the availability of our table, and we were told that we would have to wait for an undetermined amount of time for another table. We then left, telling them that we would never return again to this disorganized, unfriendly and uncommunicative establishment. We then drove to nearby Eggsqui restaurant, where we were seated within 10 minutes, had great, very friendly service."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife for a late brunch. We  both ordered the meal at the same time. She ordered the benedict and I ordered nothing special, just 2 eggs with smoked meat and a side of Italian sausage. Not sure why, but my wife's food is half way done and mine is still not here... After the waiter saw me waiting impatiently... She finally brought me my food. 
And guess what, food is cold. Even the toasts are cold. The waiter claimed it just came out of the kitchen, I told her, be my guest and take bite and see it yourself. 

Maybe I have too high expectations for a restaurant nowaday but my food arrived after a long period and it was cold... And they are telling me it came right out of the kitchen. 
What kind of service is that? Am I really asking too much? 

To end the story, they did remake everything for me... Well by the time they will me this, my wife has already finish her plate. 

Thank you for making my Sunday brunch like this."}
{"text":"We went in the morning around 10 o'clock on Friday . We wanted to sit the place next to the window, guess what did they say? It is reserved. For who? In a breakfast restaurant? Seriously?

{"text":"Very quiet place and not at all busy for Saturday brunch. Friendly service and my food was brought quickly. Tasty food and large portions (though like most brunch places, I honestly find it to be too expensive for what it is). Clean and large dining area. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great fresh breakfast, large portions, attentive and quick service!

Can't ask for much more in a breakfast place!!"}
{"text":"HUGE portion and very fair price, but quality didn't follow. My friend barely ate 1/10 of the plate (croissant with a lot of potatoes that you can never finish) and felt full. Overall it's a nice and convenient place to go if you are starving in the morning."}
{"text":"The volume is big. The taste is a little bit salty but ok. The service is good. It's a good place to have a good brunch without waiting for long time in ligne"}
{"text":"I'll try to make this to the point. This happened last Saturday, January 23rd.

Hubby & I line up, we're waiting in the cold vestibule between the outside door and the restaurant doors. 

Line doesn't move for 20 minutes, yet we see several people leave (meaning tables free up) during that time. 

We're still waiting. I go into the restaurant and tell a staff member that clients have been leaving, yet the waiting line is not moving. A group of 4 comes in behind us (remember this for later). I asked her if people were being seated. She told me they were cleaning the tables. Ok, fine. I go back into the cold vestibule. 

As time passes they slowly, and I mean slowly, start seating the people lined up in front of us. We make it into the actual restaurant. Ahh, it's so much warmer now, but hubby & I are still waiting. 

A table for 4 becomes available real close to us, but I watched the guy and he spent, it must have been, 5 minutes prepping & resetting the table. If that's how long it takes to reset ONE table during peak business hours.... 

Finally once the table was ready, the hostess went behind us and seated the group of 4 who arrived after my husband & I. At this point, my husband totally snapped and we left famished, after waiting uncomfortably for 30 minutes, watching the turtle slow workers, then being skipped in line. 

WE WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE AGAIN. THEY HAVE NO CLUE ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE."}
{"text":"This place is not as great as it was when it opened two years ago. The quality is getting lower but the quantity is ok."}
{"text":"Everything you could want for breakfast served by a very friendly staff. I had eggs with buckwheat crepes (Gluten free) and really enjoyed them. While the plates are not garnished with all the fruit that Chez Cora puts on its plates the prices were a bit less and I think the quality was just a bit better."}
{"text":"This was one of my worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant.  My sister and I went for lunch.  First,  it took 15 minutes to place our orders.  The waitress seemed more interested talking to other clients than to take our orders.   The restaurant was packed so I understand that our order took 20 minutes to be brought to our table.  My order was missing half its items.  The waitress said it was coming.  I didn't mind as I was catching up with my sister.  After 10 minutes,  I tried to waive at her in a respectful manner,  she made a minute sign with her finger. I continued talking to my sister.  10 minutes later,  I tried to waive at her again,  she looked at me and ignored my sign.  We were seated just beside the kitchen so she had to pass beside our table to get her orders.  She must have passed 30 times without checking up on our table.  After an hour,  I haven't touched my plate since I didn't get all my items and by that time,  what was in front of me was cold,  my sister finished eating.  To make matters worse,  after an hour and a half,  she comes,  cleans up the table and asks if it will be one or to tabs.  I politely tell her that I am not paying as I didn't get my order in full and that being ignored is not a way to treat a client.  She made a runt and left without apologizing.  The manager came and asked what was going on.  She apologized and said that I wouldnt have to pay.  Well,  that was obvious.  I left,  ordered from a food court restaurant and went to work.  Thanks for ruining a rare lunch date with my sister."}
{"text":"We were seated in a booth, ordered coffees and noticed 5 fruit flies in our booth.. requested to be seated elsewhere and her reply was: sorry it's closed everywhere else and there's no waiters.. we arrived at 2:45 and hour and 15 mins before closing... service 0... we spoke to 2 waiters regarding the issue and they said there's nothing that can be done..."}
{"text":"The food was good. Like regular breakfast good but the service was ridiculously awful. Upon 3 min of receiving our food the table was covered by fruit flies flying over our food and it became a really stressful game to eat while trying to chase the flies. I asked our waitress to be moved and she pretty much told us it was the same situation in the whole restaurant without apologizing and asked if I wanted to see the manager. Yes. 10 minutes later I was told there was no manager. And seeing me trying to chase another fly she actually chuckled and walked away. The restaurant should not be opened and accept paying customers under these conditions. Never returning."}
{"text":"Finally a place that gets it when it comes to breakfast. Probably the best breakfast place in the area. Nice portions, great price, fast and great service. My waitress was Veronique, she made my experience one to remember."}
{"text":"I would definitely go here again. Their eggs/bacon/potato dish with fresh fruit was delicious, my daughter was super happy with their pancake plate and the servers were very quick about coffee refills.
If you were thinking about Eggspectations for breakfast, go here instead."}
{"text":"Another review mentioned this but we showed up at 10 and had a couple minutes wait then when we left at 11 it must have been forty minutes. 

The only great item I had were the potatoes with cheese on top. Definitely a style I've not had for breakfast, more of a mash."}
{"text":"Waitress was rude and inattentive. Food was just okay, it is standard diner food and nothing special. Portions were way too big, wasteful."}
{"text":"Our relatives brought us to Allo Mon Coco for breakfast.  There are quite a few locations in Montreal.  I think this is the branch we visited.  

The breakfast did not disappoint.  Each of us was happy and stuffed!  Our crepes were extremely delicious!!  Sorry, but I do not remember the names of our crepes.  Have a feeling that they are all good.

Highly recommend visiting one of their locations when in Montreal!!"}
