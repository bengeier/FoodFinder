{"text":"We ordered many times from this place. The food quality is good. Best dishes are shanghai noodles, tom yum soup, chicken satay, chicken with cashew, thai spicy soya fried rice and purple basil chicken. I totally recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The chicken I ordered in the green curry was extremely tough.It didn't seem like chicken at all.When I complained to the waiter saying it's texture was not anything like chicken,he assured me that it was chicken indeed and looks and feels different because of the cutting and the cooking method.I refused to eat it and he was very kind to offer anything else that I 2ould eat instead.I ordered the green curry vegetable and it was delicious. Both came with coconut rice and it was worth every penny."}
{"text":"I've been here twice before - the first time wasn't so bad, but this time was THE worst! My colleague made a reservation for 8 of us; when six of us arrived at the restaurant we were seated right away, but no one came to take our order or even offer us water for at least 10 minutes. It wasn't even that busy..it wasn't until my other 2 colleagues joined us that we were finally approached by the waiter. Our orders were taken, and after 10 minutes the first food dishes came out. 

I ordered lunch combo B - mango salad with a Thai spring roll and Pad Thai. It came with a choice of lemongrass or wonton soup. I chose the lemongrass - it wasn't bad but was quite salty. When my main dish arrived, the pad thai looked orange/red and the spring roll was really greasy. The pad thai was literally a pile of noodles covered in sugary ketchup... it didn't even have egg, tofu or veggies in it. There was the occasional piece of onion but that was it. The spring roll was greasy and lacked flavour. The mango salad was the only half-decent thing. Two of my colleagues had lunch combo C - fish with rice. I don't even think there was any fish in the dish - it was lumps of doughy batter in a gloopy sauce with rice and mushrooms. 

Even though the lunch special was only $8.50 I've had MUCH better food for less than that. A Thai restaurant up the street serves delicious lunch specials for $6.99. This was THE WORST pad thai I think I've ever had. Not to mention the poor service. No one even came around to top up our water glasses, and one of my colleagues didn't even get one. I very rarely complain about my food, but this was a terrible experience and I won't be back!"}
{"text":"I went to Star Anise last night before catching a movie with a friend and  I can't say that I'd ever go back. 

The staff was very friendly and the restaurant atmosphere was nice, but the food wasn't great. The soups (coconut chicken and lemongrass shrimp) we're overly salty, the lemongrass chicken vermicelli was flavorless and the vermicelli looked more like thick rice spaghetti noodles, and the basil beef was basically inedible. The beef had such a strange texture, that I took two bites and left the rest untouched.

Perhaps we just ordered the wrong dishes or they were having an off night but I for one ordered a large popcorn at the movies to stop my stomach from rumbling."}
{"text":"Having moved from Vancouver where pho restaurants are cheap, delicious and plentiful, this place was a severe disappointment.  The first spring roll we were served was frozen in the middle.  I recognized them from my Costco grocery excursions - $8.99 for a bag of 20.  Served with some wilted veggie slivers and somehow bland sweet chilli sauce.  My pho - a dish I'd been looking forward to all day - had four buoyant carrot cubes, green pepper and other STIR FRY food items.  The kicker?  No vermicelli.  Nope, this guy was served was spaghetti's Asian cousin.  Anyone familiar with the usual spread at pho restaurants?  Basil, sprouts and sauces were nowhere to be found.  Service was fine.  It seems as though they spent a bit too much money decorating and unfortunately the food suffered."}
{"text":"really like the general tao chicken lunch special.  the wonton soup is good too.  the fried rice is a little bland.  Noodles are pretty good as well.  good lunch time spot."}
{"text":"I've been to this place multiple times.  It's a fairly small restaurant, with only about 10-12 tables and always packed around lunch time.  

Why come to this place: Decent Asian food in Yorkville for cheap.  Curry is delicious and they have a good selection of lunch specials (at least 15-20, they have pho, pad thai, curry and stir-fry dishes, and starting from $6 - realistically - $7 if you want something good) and you can customize the combo to add fried rice as well.

Best dishes: Green curry and pad thai.

Things to avoid: Just get the lunch special and not the combo.  The soup is mediocre and the spring roll is a bit bland.  

Final verdict: Great for a quick business lunch."}
{"text":"After many years, this place is now closed permantly."}
{"text":"So I came here for lunch for the first time today, partly because most other places needed a wait and this one was pretty empty.

So the service is nice the waiters are friendly and they smile and make it a happy atmosphere BUT the food wasn't that great. I got the beef pho which was pretty good but I had also ordered the Thai iced tea and had the wonton soup. The Thai iced tea was initially reallyyy sweet for me and I had to add in some water to dilute it --which then made it taste better. And the wonton soup was reaaaalllyyy salty. I really couldn't even drink the soup and just ate the wontons which still felt salty.

We also ordered the pad Thai dish and couldn't finish the small portion because we felt it was too sweet after a few bites.

Could just be my taste, and I would come back here since the pho was decent!"}
{"text":"I was craving noodles this afternoon. I was in the area (Toronto Reference Library) and too lazy to walk South on Yonge to the many noodle places so popped in here. I got the lunch special - chicken pho with spicy laksa broth.

First - I was the ONLY one in the restaurant. Hmmm...this was not a good sign.

Second - some of the chicken pieces in my soup were not cooked through. 

Third - the soup said pho but the noodles were either ramen noodles or regular spaghetti noodles (!!!!!!)

I came back from this place about 30 mins ago and now I don't feel too good. It may the half cooked chicken.

I don't think I will go again unless I am in the area and starving. 

Should I give this place another chance? I need to think about that....."}
{"text":"Favorite beef pho in town. Nice service too, friendly staff. Would definitely go back. Price is good for portion and the vietnamese spring rolls are amazing."}
{"text":"Walked into the restaurant and it was just full, it was a short wait for a table. The interior was plain and nothing really stood out but it was well lit and clean. The service was satisfactory but the server seemed like she was in a bit of a rush.

Ordered the lunch special that came with mango salad, pad Thai and a spring roll. Chose the wonton soup over the lemon grass soup, which was a good choice for a couple reasons: protein and the other soup was sour. The soup came with two wontons and it was a bit salty. The mango salad was very refreshing and sour. The pad Thai was decent but there was no protein in it at all. The spring roll saved the entire plate, the only thing with protein and was not sour. The portion size was good for the lunch special price, was definitely full after. Was people started leaving no new table came in, short lunch rush.

Overall, a very average meal. The lunch specials were a pretty good deal and it is a short walk from work so there might be future visits."}
