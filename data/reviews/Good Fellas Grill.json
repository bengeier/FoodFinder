{"text":"Food was amazing! We saw a sign spinner on 19th ave and Greenway that said $1.99 gyro sandwich.... I looked to my right and I saw Good Fellas Grill in the Chino Bandito shopping mall. It was probably the best decision I had made all day, after a 7 hour work day I walked in was greeted, and ordered our two gyro sandwiches. We were given large servings of soup from the owner, my bf had chicken curry potato and I tried the lentil which were both amazing. We received our gyros which were on the best pita bread I've honestly ever had, the gyro was not greasy which I've had gyros that were total opposite, the onions and tomatoes were nice and fresh as well. The facilities were very clean, they had two big screens playing ESPN, which I love, and the bathrooms were nice and clean. The owner introduced himself as well which I find very respectable. I will be going back and I recommend you try Good Fellas Grill, you will be going back for more."}
{"text":"Great food, great people and a clean restaurant.  I'm a personal Chef and I'm picky when it comes to food.  I had the 3 meat combo and a side of Gyros meat.  It took me about 20 minutes to eat.  I'm not a slow eater by any means but,  The flavor was out of this WORLD!!!!  When Ninos wrote on his menu \" A Skewer of seasoned ground beef, a skewer of marinated chicken and a skewer of seasoned Rib-eye steak charbroiled to PERFECTION.\" He was not kidding.  Cant wait to go back with my wife and kid."}
{"text":"What amazing food... every time I have been there I have been greeted with the most homemade soup - it is just warming and makes you feel good. Then the chicken is so tender and seasoned to perfection - yes, I kid you not - every time it has been so for me. But my most fav after the soup is the delirious rice - its a must go to to try!!!! You'll love the family style atmosphere and the food too. Ill be back, time and time again... Thank you for making this one of my favorite yummy places to go to - esp on a night when I don't have time to cook - its always good to know there is quick, nutritious food out there for me to grab. Just go, and you will know of what I speak of for your self."}
{"text":"This without a doubt is one of the greatest places I've eaten at for Mediterranean food. The meat is full of flavor and the menu options although semi limited are definitely of good quality . You cannot go wrong with ordering anything from their menu as all the food is equally delicious. The service was great and the actual restaurant was clean. I definitely will be back. And the complimentary lentil soup is outstanding."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  The spices were just right. Had the Kafla which was hit and seasoned just right.  The wife had the chicken kabob which was moist an delicious as well.  We'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here you need to do yourself a justice and eat here. The chicken is perfectly marinated and cooked to excellence, literally melts in your mouth. The beef is tender juicy and coked to perfection. Hummus and pita is excellent. I have been searching for a place like this for a while. Not to mention nenose(not sure that's how you spell it) is the nicest guy you will ever meet. Treats his customers like friends and is a genuinely happy great guy. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good about this place.....we just happened across it since my husband works nearby - but as many of the other writers have said, wonderfully friendly owners, very accommodating, and the food is great!!   How can you go wrong!?   Eat there or take home, either works just as well.  Soups are fabulous, and the chicken/rice is the best ever - tender white meat, leaves you wanting more!!"}
{"text":"My wife & I decided to come here on a spur of the moment; whipping out Yelp, we saw the high ratings and headed over for dinner.    The guy taking out order was exceptionally kind & energetic and explained in fine detail the unique elements of each dish.    I got a kafta & chicken plate while my wife got the gyro plate.  And then we were surprised when he said he would give us a couple bowls of soup (potato/chicken/curry, and a lentil soup) for free!  (This was before he even knew we came in off the yelp review).  Turns out this kind guy taking our order was also the owner and his name is Ninos.   What amazing service!!!  And the food??  Absolutely delicious!!  Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing here! The soup is hot and great, the place is super clean and great service. The chicken kabobs are very tasty! Will def be back for more."}
{"text":"I put in an order online, walked in around 8:15pm, the crew was mopping, the seats were on the tables, and noticed on the sign they closed at 8. I explained that I had put in an order online and didn't realize they closed at 8 and would just take a refund.  I was impressed with the customer service as I know most places would've have just given me refund, instead the owner told me they would fire up the kitchen and get me the food I ordered and even gave me soup while I waited! I had the gyro plate which was delicious and was a large portion, my girlfriend had the steak wrap and fries which she said was amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I love finding hidden gems like this. When we drove up to the restaurant we weren't really sure what to expect...but as soon as we walked in the service was great and the food was even better. If you like home-style Mediterranean food then I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This was an excellant place to eat, the only reason it didn't get 5 starts is I only thought the Tziki sauce was ok. I had the 3 meat dinner and a friend had the GYRO (or this is what I would call it). The meals came with a complementary bowl of soup I had lentil she had potato, both were excellant, my meal came on a bed of rice that was some of the best I have had,  I think it was flavored with safron or safflower. The price was outstanding my 3 meat entre was 11.99 my companions was 7.99. If you want a great meal at a realy really good price go to Good Fellas Grill."}
{"text":"Better than the ratings suggest. What a great experience,  the owner was incredible, the soup, Excellent, the portions, Huge, the tastes, Fantastic! The restraunt was amazingly clean and the people were unbelievably friendly."}
{"text":"The food is addictive! Sooo good. My wife and I frequent this place often. She actually craves it. Every menu item is spot on authentic. Fresh ingredients and prepared wonderfully. I can't think of a single complaint. Everything is always clean and inviting. Great food for great prices makes this a \"must\" for anyone seeking a fantastic meal. Would've given 6 stars if I could. Great job, Ninos!"}
{"text":"I had to go into goodfellas after all the positive reviews and gotta say it's freaking good! Right when I opened that door I got excited..I got that good marination fresh authentic smell. I love Mediterranean/Greek food that's what I grew up eating and I gotta say this place is the closest I ve had or tried that comes to my mothers food or that's not from east coast.  We were welcomed by a younger man and and he was very sweet/helpful/knowledgeable abt his menu.. We ordered I took his recommendation which was very very good!! he brought us soup on the house which was impressive and good!! That is so little but such a nice homey touch that u don't find too many places these days then got our sandwiches they were steaming hot and fresh and the spice taste marination were spot on so I started stuffing my face then I thought ok if their hummus is good they know what's up so I went and ordered it (after I was seating/eating already) that's how excited I was that I finally found a Mediterranean place!! Got it and yup just like my mamas lol enough said point being u gotta try this restaurant if ur looking for amazing authentic Mediterranean food. Can't wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"I don't get all of the great reviews.  Yes, the owner is constantly there, that's nice, but its the food that counts.  I did not try any of the soups, which I hear are very good, but if I had to sum up the dish I did get it would be PLAIN.   I got the steak kababs with rice and tomato.  The steak is seasoned with salt and pepper.  That's it.  The rice has \"vegetable oil\" and some \"vegetable seasoning\".  That's it.  No Ghee, no saffron.  The tomato wasn't even grilled, just sliced.  The portion of rice was good, but there were only about 5 small pieces of steak.  All this for 9.99.  I think it was the most expensive item on the menu, and certainly not impressive."}
{"text":"They provided soup while me and my mother waited for our order Food was great for being a first time customer visiting from California  Thanks guys"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The service is always good and the food is always great! The lunch special is the best deal! Try their free chicken and potato soup, and the hummus! You won't be disappointed. The portions are huge and I ALWAYS leave with leftovers."}
{"text":"Yum!!great gyros entree!!and Kabob Hindu has lots of great flavor. Definitely would recommend. Low prices and clean!!"}
{"text":"I'm really happy we found Good Fellas. What a great place tucked away on a little strip mall that doesn't do it justice!  We love Greek/Med foods, so it's nice to find a good one close to home. Good Fellas had very reasonable prices, and the owner was extremely nice. The service was just wonderful, and you can tell the owner really cares about his customers' experience. I'm not sure what the other posters are saying in regard to the prices. I think $7.99 for a chicken kabob wrap, crispy hot fries and a drink is pretty reasonable!  It also appears that they have cheaper lunch specials.  We had hummus to start ($4.99, I believe - also reasonable in my book). It was wonderful and very tasty! The pita that came with it were piping hot, hot, hot! Perfection. I enjoyed the chicken kabob wrap, and my dining partner got the gyro. Both were super yum and cooked perfectly. The owner (Ninos?) offered us the lentil soup and the chicken curry soup for free. They both were steaming hot, and both were very, very good!  Our daughter was dining with us, and Nino even offered to make her a special soup that wasn't as hot. He was super nice.   I like this place a lot more than Chicago Gyros, which I think is pretty dang good, too. But I give this way more thumbs up for the service, and I also think the food was better.   Our food was great, and all of it was super hot - a big plus in my book. We will be back for sure. I highly recommend it!   I can see myself craving this place."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Service was excellent.  All the food was really good.  The baklava is amazing!  One of the best I've had.  Nice atmosphere.  Lentil soup. ..yummy!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to this place for the first time tonight. The gentleman who took our order was very friendly and polite and gave us two servings of soup on the house.      The food was fantastic . The lentil soup was to die for. The hummus was delicious, the chicken kabob was tender and tasty.     The restaurant was clean and well lit and the prices very reasonable. I am new to the area and have been looking for good, locally owned establishments and this fits the bill. I will be going back"}
{"text":"Very good.   Food was good ... service by owner himself.    He even brought us his Lentl soup to try on the house.   Will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been there twice. First time I went alone, excellent! Second time I brought my wife 02/20/2012 around 7pm. I'm so glad I brought my wife to experience the gyro's sandwich. She basically said that it was the best gyro's sandwich she's ever tasted in her life. We will for sure 100%, most definitely, absolutely, positively, be going back."}
{"text":"Friendly people run this place.   The food is good if a little americanized.. would have liked more flavour. . I had the chicken kabob sandwich and chicken potato curry soup..  It was all under $10.00 even with a soda.. I'll be back. ."}
{"text":"You will simply not find a nicer place to eat if you're looking for great Mediterranean food.  You're NEVER a number, you're a friend. They've cheefully followed through on special requests I've made on several occasions when I've eaten there and the quality of the food has always been consistant.   Even on the two Grand Opening Nights, the service and quality of the food was fantastic as was apparent by the tremendous lines that were forming outside the door!"}
{"text":"Went here last night and I was pretty impressed. It is a small place tucked away in one a strip malls. The guy behind the counter (who I'm assuming is the owner) welcomed us and gave us some advice on what to order. He didn't try to upsell anything either, which I appreciate. He gave the two of us each a free bowl of soup to try. I had some sort of chicken platter and my other half had a gyro. Both were good. The highlights were the garlic sauce, chicken with lots of grilled flavor, and really good fries. I don't really think there was a down side, except that my lentil soup was just okay (then again it was free!) Overall great!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent staff, owner very welcoming, and offers free soups! We had the Gyro plate and the 2 meat platter, chicken and steak."}
{"text":"I came here because of the other yelp reviews.  The place was clean, very courteous staff, and now the food; so darn goods.   I had the lunch special, which mind you is $5.99 +tax. It came with a soup starter, pita, and a plate full of rice, salad and three samplings of meat: gyro, chicken, kofta (I think that's what they are all called).    This was just unbelievably good. Great smell, taste, spice. The rice is magical, the portions were ample. If I were going to be in Phoenix longer id go again. I overheard some other patrons say 'so what'd you get yesterday again?' The people here know what's up.   Ps, clean bathrooms and a soda fountain machine too."}
{"text":"If I could give Good Fellas Grill more than 5 stars, I absolutely would. The food is incredible. You start off with a complimentary soup- we had the lentil and chicken potato. The chicken potato was awesome but the lentil was out of this world. We also ordered the hummus platter and falafel platter, both were the best I've ever had. The pita bread was so fresh and piping hot. We finished by splitting the chicken kabob platter which comes with rice and sliced tomatoes/onions. Excellent. It's really hard to nail down what the best part was. And the service was great as well. I wish I weren't so full so I could turn around and eat it all again. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We just ate here for the first time and are seriously impressed. The owners are super friendly and inviting. We ordered to go and she asked if we wanted a complimentary bowl of soup while we waited. The food was fully cooked to order and extremely fresh. Hands down the best Mediterranean food I've had in Phoenix. You must get the baklava to complete your order."}
{"text":"This is the best flavorful Middle Eastern food you'll ever find in the valley for a reasonable price, the place is clean and inviting especially that the owner is almost always there to help you with menu suggestions and he's keen on providing Middle Eastern hospitality, he offers a taste of the soups for free the first time and keeps recognizing my family every time we show up.. My fav is #7 The chicken pieces are so tender and delicious the Kebab is flaforful I also love the rice and garlic mousse. I highly recommend this place to all my friends!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I were looking for something new tonight, so I went to Yelp and did some digging in our area. Good Fellas Grill came up, so we gave it a try. Out of the reviews I had read, I was excited for two things: meeting Ninos (the owner), and the complimentary soup. I couldn't believe it. Complimentary Soup?! I've heard of complimentary chips and salsa at Macayos, but I've never heard of complimentary soup. We had to check this spot out. We walked in, and the first thing you see is a menu on the wall with pics of the dishes. Awesome! A man came out and greeted us. I thought to myself: This must be Ninos! I didn't say anything because I didn't want to have a Yelper geek out moment and freak him out. He was nice, and helped us out with the menu since it was our first time. He suggested the Meat Combo Plate, so we went for it. He asked me for my name, and he introduced himself and shook my hand. He brought out the Lentil and Potato Curry Soup and introduced himself to my hubby. Throughout our meal he asked how we were, and it was nice, because he cared. You could see it in his eyes! He wanted the customers to be happy.   FOOD  We had the meat combo and the gyro plate and the complimentary potato curry soup and lentil soup. All of it was fresh, and the meats were packed with sock it to me flavor. The gyro plate was a gyro with fries. The bread the gyro came on was fresh and crisp, the gyro meat was fresh from the rotisserie, and the fries were hot and crispy. The meat combo was a row of chicken pieces and ground beef, rice, tomatos, pita bread and onions.   I'm a carnivore, and I've had my fair share of chicken, beef, etc. This location had the best tasting chicken/ground beef I have ever had. None of it was dry. It was juicy and filled with sock it to me spices. Yummy!  SERVICE  Ninos....nuff said! He was the service, and he was an exceptional host with a warm smile.  Support this business!"}
{"text":"Well I definitely found my new favorite spot to eat!!! I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and it was AMAZING!!! I also ordered the lunch special which was 3 meats with 1/2 rice and 1/2 salad and that was AMAZING!!! I don't usually right reviews but this place was deserving of my time!!! They do offer potato soup on the house and I ate all that too(I was really hungry!) I am so excited to try other items on the menu and I will be returning with my whole family for them to enjoy as well!!! I brought home the two lettuce wraps that I didn't finish and let my son try it so I told him to take a a bite and I wanted to see his reaction to how yummy it was and when he bit it his eyes opened wide and he was like,\" wow that IS good, what is that white sauce!?!\" (That's what she said!!!) ahahahaha anyway I knew he would like it!!!"}
{"text":"It was good, good service, and good soup(on the house). I ordered 3 meat combo and it was really good. Just dont sit under ceiling fan , food got cold pretty fast:/"}
{"text":"Don't judge the food by the look of the joint, best food, excellent prices, friendly service! I keep going there again and again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were on another of our road trips from Southern California!  We hadn't eaten all day and were in the mood for some homestyle, ethnic, one of a kind cuisine.  Well, our search brought us to Good Fellas Grill!  We were in the right place.  Ninos  (pronounced Knee-Nose) Lol :-) greeted us and made a couple of recommendations for the Gyro Plate and the Chicken/Beef combo plate.  He even threw in a couple of soups-lental and a potato soup.  Everything was out of this world.  Not only were our meals amazing but the baklava was some of the best I have ever had!  If you are in the mood for great Mediterranean food, a down home friendly environment, and  a place to watch whatever sporting event is the hype of the day.  This is the place to go!  Good Fellas Grill It is the real deal.  Not to mention that the quality of the food is awesome and the prices.... super reasonable.    Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"Ninos, aside from being a Bears fan, is an absolutely outstanding cook and an outstanding host.  the chicken kebabs and the lentil soup all the way!  Allah Tif this place stays in biz!"}
{"text":"2 meat combo was amazing. free potato soup made the deal that much sweeter. Hospitality was great. The owner is mad chill. Great experience. Fun for the whole family"}
{"text":"Gyro plate was very delicious. Pistachio baklava was one of the best we've ever tasted in the U.S."}
{"text":"OMG, WOW - Excellent great food and service in a clean causual setting.  No frills, just good food from a friendly greek family.  It appears they all work there.  We had the 3 meat combo(very tender and juicy), Tattosh Salad(simple and fresh) and Lentil soup(wonderful unique Mediterranean seasoning).   These were enough to share for two.  As well, they have several Gyro/sandwich, fries, & drink combo's for 7.99.  While eating there, it was obvoius that they have a lot of return business."}
{"text":"TASTY TASTY TASTY  The Hinny Beef is like a Spicey Persian Meatloaf.   Awesome.."}
{"text":"I stopped by for some takeout and was not disappointed. There were several vegan options for my wife, including a few things I hadn't tried before. Ninos was so nice, and gave good recommendations, as well as a complimentary bowl of hot soup while I waited. The food was delicious, although a bit saltier than I felt necessary. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Unbelievable Food and Unbelievable prices the service was excellent and i could definitely a place i would add to my regular list!"}
{"text":"We have been here before and for some reason the warm weather today gave me a craving for a plate of hummus. So my husband took the family there for dinner and everything was very delicious and flavorful as usual. Along w/ the hummus we had falafel and fries and we just couldn't stop saying, \"Oh! This is sooo yummy!\" Anyway, you should really try this place if you like this type of food. Pretty sure you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't like to give five stars to any place because, really, who can be perfect?  Gotta say though, Good Fellas comes pretty darn close!  I've been a few times now and tried a number of different options.  The 2 or 3 meat combos are staples of goodness with highlights on the chicken and the delicious garlic sauce that matches it so well.  The vegetarian platter is also fantastic and I have no problem picking it on a number of different occasions.  For sandwiches, the marinated chicken on french bread was just right.  To top it off, the service and atmosphere is an example of how to do things right.  I don't think I would have found this place without Yelp, but I'm sure glad I did.  With a great restaurant like this, I can't help but keep coming back!"}
{"text":"We live near here, and this place is great for us for casual dine in or take out. I'm a fan of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern food. This place offers a pretty standard fair and they do it well. The service is quick and friendly and the food is tasty and inexpensive. The experience here is consistent. If you're looking for a casual dining experience with good food, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem.  A friend and I made our first vist last week and were delighted. Food is fabulous, prices are reasonable and Nino, the owner, made us feel right at home. The place nothing fancy but very clean.    We tried the lunch special, which consisted of three meats, (chicken, gyros & Kafta), rice, and a salad. At $5.99 it was a bargin plus Nino gave us complimentary bowls of soup because we were first time customers.     Everything was delicious.  It was so good that my friend got another order to take home for dinner.  We also enjoyed a piece of baklava;for desert. It was very high quality - we could taste the butter.  Just thinking abour it is making my mouth water!"}
{"text":"I really hope the word gets out about this place. Ninos has a really good thing going here.  Stopped for takeout dinner and was welcomed by Ninos. He went over the menu and provided us a bowl of soup for free while we waited. Both the lentil and potato soup were delish. This place really knows how to use seasoning right.  We ordered the kabob meals and they were really good. Kabobs were fair in size but the rice portion was large, definitely enough for a couple meals. Meals came with pita and a light, almost butter like garlic spread. The spread was so good on the warm pita.  The place was exceptionally clean and I would definitely go back to try more on the menu.  Wish I worked closer because I would be a frequent visitor for the $4.99 lunch specials.  I really loved the combo of good food and great hospitality!"}
{"text":"Lunch special....gyros, kafta, marinated chicken, small salad and lentil soup for 5.99.  Everything was fresh made to order and very good.  You cannot beat that price.  the other gyro place in the old circle k parking lot on union hills is not as good and more expensive."}
{"text":"The food was great. The service was excellent. Thoroughly enjoyed our visit. Wish we had this closer to our home. Had the gyro plate and the grilledchicken salad. The entire staff was super."}
{"text":"You know you drive by this place all the time and would think, ugh, whole place doesn't look good, but try to find a parking place somedays cause it's PACKED..  Good Fellas is a no frills, amazing food kind of place and prices are great.  My husband sort of AGREED to go here but didn't even know what Greek food tasted like, he was impressed... trouble is then you can't get that great taste out of your head..  can't wait to go back.."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to go here for nearly a year and never got around to it.  Nearly collapsing from hunger after getting off work late yesterday, I stumbled in here half an hour to closing.  I ordered the veggie sampler and had a chat with the owner, Ninos, while I waited for my food.  The complimentary lentil soup was delish and helped me survive the short wait until my food was ready.  Ninos is as awesome as everyone says - such a warm, friendly guy.  A real breath of fresh air with the way most businesses are these days.  As others have mentioned, the restaurant is pretty spartan, but it was very clean.  Some of those hole in the wall restaurants have tasty food but have you trying not to look too closely at the tables or study the grime engraved in the walls.  Definitely not the case here - it was very clean and bright.  On to the food.  I wasn't all that crazy about the potato cake, but it seemed like the distant Grecian cousin of shepherd's pie, which I can't stand.  That's just personal tastes, nothing against Good Fellas.  Otherwise, my food was very tasty.  The hummus had an unexpected yet delightful smoky hint.  The unexpected star of my meal was the boorack, a delicious pocket of dough stuffed with savory mushrooms and potatoes.  I've never had them before but loved them.  I'd love to see a grilled veggie kabob added to the menu.  I was a little surprised that I didn't see one on the menu, although I was looking at the carryout menu and didn't double check the posting on the wall, so I'm not totally positive one hasn't been added.  In the meantime, I'll try to avoid buying a truckload of that boorack; I don't think my waistline would appreciate it.  ;)"}
{"text":"I tried this place because of Yelp reviews.  I have been several times and I am impressed by the atmosphere and the attitude of the owner / employees.  They are always very friendly.  The food is yummy, starting with the lentil soup.  I usually get a gyro or 2-meat plate and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Did a terrific job with our catering order for a birthday party. We ordered chicken and kofte kebabs, with salad and rice. Everything was delicious, and we would definitely use them again."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here often.  We love their food.  The Hummus is the best I have had.  I can't eat the pita, so I eat the hummus with a spoon.  It is that good!!!!  The soups are awesome as well.  Chicken potato is what we get but the lentil is delish as well.      This is one of the best places for good food that is not expensive.  A must go to."}
{"text":"I've been there twice now. The complimentary lentil soup was just as good this time as the last. The owners are very accommodating and made up a 'junior' plate of the chicken, rice and pita for me. The chicken was moist and flavorful and I'm extremely picky. The rice was aromatic and tasty. It's clean and simple with very good food."}
{"text":"Yelpers did it again! The free chicken potato soup while we waited on our gyros was amazing! The gyros were great! Only 4 stars because it is the only time we've eaten there. Don't live here, but would stop again!"}
{"text":"If you love Greek/Mediterranean food, this place if AWESOME. The owner is a very friendly, hardworking, kind person.  He recommended the #7, 2 meat combo and #12, gyro plate, so we would be able to taste 3 types of meat, gyro, ground beef and chicken.    Along with the main course, he brought us 2 soups, Potato and Lentil, both complimentary, which were very good. The 3 meats on the platters were seasoned nicely, very fresh and moist as well as the tomatoes and onions. The rice was superb along with the tzatziki sauce, garlic spread and fresh pita bread. We were shocked at how extremely moist the chicken meat was.  Also, amazed at the amount of food served for the price.    The atmosphere is very plain and casual. But don't let that deter you because they make great food here."}
{"text":"I reviewed this place over a year ago and it still is a local favorite for my family.  Yummy and fresh food, delicious flavors, friendly service..so nice  to be able to patronize a neighborhood family-owned business that provides high quality food.  It's in a wierd little strip mall, but definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I have it to give it to these guys: their food is in a word, phenomenal. I was initially skeptical of all the positive reviews because of the strip mall ambience and the fact that it's a 20 minute drive for me, but once I made that drive I've been going back regularly.   I get the three meat gyro plate, and every single component (chicken, kaftan, ribeye, rice, freshly sliced onions and tomatoes) is just perfect. The meat is tender, the rice is pillowy soft, and the onions and tomatoes are always very fresh. This is not just the best mediterranean food in the valley, but also beats anything I have had in new york city."}
{"text":"We love it at Good Fellas. Nino's is very personable and always makes you feel welcome. The food is priced very reasonably and is excellent value. If you like flavorful good Greek food, you've come to the best place!! It's easy to select meal as they have photos. Everything is delicious...We have tried different dishes...the meat dishes taste good and moist, not dry, the rice is flavorful, both lentil and potato soups are very good. Comfortable dining area. We've taken our relatives here and will continue to patronize the restaurant. You will not regret it. Thanks Nino."}
{"text":"Really cute, well-priced, authentic atmosphere.  Mom and pap-like shop. Definitely happy to support this business."}
{"text":"I've been by this place a couple of times, and am a bit ashamed to say I haven't been by more, since I literall live within walking distance of this place. This entire plaza actually has lots of hole in the wall gems- Chino Bandido's is most famous, but Good Fella's is awesome, and so is Muffin But the Best.   But more about Good Fellas. It's greek, and it's family owned. Each time we've been in it's been the same gentleman manning the front counter. He's soft spoken, so nice, and if you tell him it's your first time here he'll go out of his way to recommend things to you. The husband usually gets the gyros, and I get the gyro or the two meat plate, as I'd rather usually eat with my utensils, versus my hands.   The gyro meat is outstanding, and I love the tzatziki sauce that comes with it. Now granted, I'm just a sucker for tzatziki in general, but this stuff is good. The meat is thinly sliced, and crisp, and the rice itself has lots of good flavor. His pita is always soft and fluffy and warm, and they are generous with the gyro meat and the tzatziki. I really ought to try out other specialities of theirs- I'm a sucker for a good plate of dolmades and a nice spanakopita.  What takes this place from good to great though- is the service. As mentioned by some others- I'm pretty sure the gentleman manning the cash register owns the place, and he's always comped us a bowl of soup each time we've been in. He even recognizes us. I get the curry and potato, and in this weather it's amazing. Warm and hearty and very curry like. He's ultra nice, and the food comes out promptly.  Cons? It's a small operation, so I've dined here before and noticed the tables not cleared away right after patrons leave. Not a deal breaker, but for those of you who are finicky... you may not like that. That and the fact that it's in a crappy little hole of a complex. They're a fairly new operation and clearly renovated before they came in- Chino's is a lot worse, but again. Some of you might care about that. Oh, and they're also not open on Sundays. Bummer when I'm craving nice greek after church.  Definitely give it a shot- it's a regular on my list, and not just because of it's proximity."}
{"text":"Great service and friendly folks. The falafel sandwich with extra tahini sauce was fresh and tasty!  Great place and free soup while you wait."}
{"text":"I want to eat EVERYthing on their menu...twice.  I had the 3 meat combo, and it's all I've been thinking about lately."}
{"text":"We are traveling through Phoenix and read all the great reviews and HAD to stop!!!   Awesome meal!!!  We had the Greek salad, 2 meat dinner, humus and gyro sandwich.  All good!  We were given complimentary soup as we waited for our meals.  chicken potato and lentil, they were both very delicious.  Large portions and very tasty!!! Service was excellent, very friendly staff.  Dessert was given to us as we were leaving. Baklava. Mmmmm.  Great place!"}
{"text":"Wow! We love, love, love this food! The 3 meat combo is awesome. Super friendly owner. Just an overall great place to eat Mediterranean. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Nice local family lunch spot. Friendly service nice options for lunch. They offer fried pompano which is rare but tasty."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch to go. It was really good. I had the gyros and fries. The meat was tender and the tzatiki sauce was delicious! Service was friendly and quick. I will definitely be going back whenever I crave tasty and economically friendly gyros :)"}
{"text":"In town for a quick business trip and looked for a good local joint to eat. Staff was friendly and accommodating. The restaurant was clean and welcoming. And the food? It was really good. I ate way too much but it was worth it. Try the kabob."}
{"text":"Just happened to be driving by this place, so I looked it up on Yelp on my mobile and decided that It sounded good.  Don't let the outside appearance be your first impression, as once you are inside, it is surprisingly well adorned and inviting.  It's casual dine in, so you order and pay at the counter and they bring you your food, self serve utensils and drink service.  But the fun begins when they bring you the food, they asked me if I wanted complimentary soup, and this time, I turned them down, and I am glad I did.  I had the daily Lunch special, which is a \"Lunch\" version of their 3 Meat combo, Kafta, Chicken, and Gyro, served on a bed of rice, with a generous salad on a plate filled to the edges.  It was totally filling, and I'm not a little man, this is why I'm glad I didn't go with the soup.  Every bit of the meal was outstanding... Flavorful, just enough spice so that you could taste the meal and not just the spice, the meat was perfectly done and tender.  The rice was excellent and even the dressing on the salad was great.  Not just your garden variety, chopped lettuce with a few pieces of tomatoe either, it had most of the entire garden in it.... It also came with a Pita with dipping sauce, which made the whole meal extremely reasonable and filling.  I was out the door at $8.50 with a drink...  Will definatley be back again and again, maybe I'll try the complimentary soup next time"}
{"text":"I was recommended to eat at this place by a friend who is local; during my visit in the Phoenix area . I have visited other Mediterranean restaurants in the past and I must say that Good Fellas Grill has been the best of them all! What I recommend: Soup, Hummos, Baba Ghanoush, 3 Meat Combo, Salad, Grilled Chicken Chopped Salad ( off menu item). if you desire great food and very friendly service then this is your place!"}
{"text":"I love love love this place.  My family and I eat here at least once a month and the food is amazing as is the staff.  I have never had a bad experience and can recommend everything on the menu.  Even my 7-year-old granddaughter loves the food and requests to eat there every Friday.  We discovered this place from going to Chino Bandido --- I was tired of feeling sick to my stomach from eating at Chino's and gave this place a try - boy was I glad we did.  We never eat at Chinos anymore!"}
{"text":"delicious, affordable, friendly. The dining room is nothing fancy, but the food is incredibly!"}
{"text":"It's very clean inside and looks fantastic! The customer service was excellent but in general the food was okay kind of bland. All my friends kept telling me to come here because the food was amazing! Maybe I will give it another chance... I have to admit I was a little disappointed in the food but the service was excellent !"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Very well priced! They give you a soup on the house - potato or lentil. Very impressed with that restaurant! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"I read all the good reviews for this place so I thought I would give it a try. My friend lives close, so I said I will meet you there. To see it, you would never think ,oh this place will be great. It is in a strange shopping center. Right next to Chino Bandito,or something like that. Though I must try that place one day as well. When you walk in it smells divine! My friend was already there and had ordered an Ice Tea. She ended up getting the Chicken lettuce wraps, and I the Gryo dish,which is on a bed of fantastic rice. We each got the chicken Potato soup. Oh my gosh, everything was fantastic!  Plus we even got pita bread and they were nice enough to give me hot tea,even though it is not on the menu. I even got 2 Baklava's to go. Which we had for dessert that night. So glad I read the reviews or I never would of known about this place. It is very clean as well, with nice clean rest rooms and lots of parking."}
{"text":"Great authentic Greek food. Had the Giro with drink and fries. Very tasty and very affordable. Also, love the bowl of complimentary potato and chicken soup. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"My favorite go-to greek place. Free soup and a generous amount of pita bread on the house, PLUS 20% off with yelp check-in. You can't beat that! Food is always full of flavor, I always get the lunch special (I just pay regular price if it's not during lunch) I always have leftovers!!!"}
{"text":"Don't let the location dissuade you. The food is very good, especially the chicken kabobs (part of the 2 meat special). Will go back."}
{"text":"Great food and service. They had a three meat lunch special so we were able to try out the chicken, gyro, and Kafka. It came with rice and salad. We were also pleasantly surprised when they told us it came with soup. Both the lentil and potato soup were good, I preferred the potato. The chicken was a tad bit dry, the other meats were good but lacked seasoning. The salad dressing seemed like it was just oil, salt, and pepper, I didn't even get a hint of vinegar - so that was disappointing. I really enjoyed the rice, it had the most flavor of all of the items. The other thing we ordered was a gyro sandwich. That was really good, and it was even better when we had it as leftovers the next day. The French fries were good. We also liked the pita basket that came with our food. We live super close, I'm sure we'll try it again."}
{"text":"Delicious potato soup and tender chicken! We loved everything. Our new fave Mediterranean place."}
{"text":"I walked into this place looking for something healthier to eat. I was a bit skeptical at the beginning, but it's my experience that most mom and post shops have the best food, so I went with it. The staff is really cool, recommended something and like always I went with it. I can not explain how my tastebuds are right now. The experience is quite pleasing! The food! Oh the food! Excellent!! I will be here again and again.   Thank you for the great food!"}
{"text":"Went here one day while trying to find a new gyro place, was not impressed.  The tzatziki sauce was super runny and didn't really have a great flavor.  The meat was ok but overall it was pretty lackluster.  Went their with a vegan friend and she seemed to enjoy her meal but we never returned even with the lack of vegan options around the house."}
{"text":"It is hard to find quality middle eastern food in Phoenix. This place is an exception. The grilled meat is delicious as is the hummus, tabouleh and baklava. And the menu offers a wide range of food plates and sandwiches. It is simple..you order at the counter, but the restaurant is airy and comfortable. If you like middle eastern food, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick and yummy lunch spot in this area and By George I think she's got it!-- name that reference!  Anyway, food is great, prices are reasonable, service is quick and painless. I will definitely be returning. Keep in mind this isn't a place to impress a first date or anything like that, when you drive up to it, it kinda seems like a hole in the wall-type place but it's pretty big inside-- nothing fancy though, which I'm alright with since I was purely interested in the quality of food at the time."}
{"text":"I don't think I iterated how wonderful the food is. The chicken is THE moistest chicken ever, i dunno what they do to their chicken but it can be cut with a fork and melts in your mouth. I don't eat rice but I will indulge in the most scrumptious rice around. This hidden gem is definitely the best Greek around. I've also had the lettuce wraps, 4 in an order, doesn't sound like enough, right? I only ate 2 and had to take the other 2 to go. They are freakin' awesome! Fresh tomatoes, chicken, and a couple of different sauces make these sooo wonderful! Did I say how yummy this place was!!? Go! now!"}
{"text":"I was not very impressed play seems a little dingy ran down now the food was okay at best lentil soup was good though 46 and carrots and onions plenty of flavor that was a highlight beef shawarma was not very good I mean why would you wrap it in a flour tortilla and not very good at that probably never go back"}
{"text":"260+ check-ins!   Yeah, if you haven't figured it out yet,  it's REALLY good!   If you are debating on trying it,  JUST DO IT!  The food is amazing!"}
{"text":"The soups were very good. The meat platter was wonderful.  The salad dressing was amazing.  We are so going back!   Just wish they had a waiter/waitress."}
{"text":"Service was great.  First timer, so the man behind the counter helped with ordering.  Suggested options, offered free soup, recommend dishes, etc...  Food was well prepared, tasted good and quick.  In and out in less than 30 minutes.  Would definetly recommend this place if you like Greek food and friendly people."}
{"text":"Wow, very good!!! I had the lettuce wraps (low carb), my wife had the gyro and my daughter had spanakopita.  We also has some hummus.  Everything tasted great! The service was excellent! Highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"WOW!! Glad I don't live here because I'd probably be here at least a few times a week!! I had the 2 meat combo with chicken and upgraded from the ground beef skewer to the steak skewer and it was delicious! Both meats were juicy and tender and full of flavor!!! The meal also came with soup and I picked the lentil soup and it was also delicious as was the pita bread, rice, and white sauce it came with!!! If I ever make it back here I would visit again!! Sorry no pic of the food it was too good to let it sit around!! The people were super nice too that just added to the experience!!!"}
{"text":"Everyone raves about the lunch combo special!  It's true!  It's a good as everyone says ... and the lentil soup .. my goodness!  Divine!  Definitely in my top 5 neighborhood joints!"}
{"text":"Gyro plate was amazing. We've been traveling. Good food is hard to find without a good review."}
{"text":"Food was really good, but could have done without the cock roach  crawling across the counter when paying for my food."}
{"text":"So good. Just so very good. I started going there a week after they opened. Good humus, kafta  is great, rice cook and flavored to perfection, chicken jucy and tender. My favorite thing is the lentil soup. I like lentil soup, but they take it to a whole new level. The decode is simple and clean."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic Mediterranean and Greek food. Half the menu is Vegetarian and Vegan and their salads are fresh and not smothered in olive oil. Plenty of grilled meat options also of course. Great, cordial service in this upstart family run restaurant. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Just had the following with my dining companion: 1.  2 meat combo (skewered chicken & chopped meat) comes with rice, tomato, pita.      EXCELLENT.  2.  BabaGanoush---Outstanding---the star of the show 3. Tabouleh--- Excellent, nice portion. 4.  Spanokopita (spinach pie) That was the reason for my visit-- Unfortunately they bake it and then when you order it they fry it up.  Too much grease on it.  I had to use napkins to soak up the grease and still it tasted greasy.  So sad.  This is my favorite greek dish that I travel for-- this is why I came.   5.  Complimentary LENTIL SOUP WHICH WAS DELICIOUS!!!  ( so they made up for the less than stellar spanokopita)   Plenty of pita was provided along with garlic sauce and a spicy sauce which I think was Harissa.  Not sure but it was tasty. Positive attitude and smiles from everyone.  Very clean and Prices are very reasonable.   Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am being messaged by the owner to remove the review which I think violates yelps policy. He says they do monthly sprays. Great. But I still saw a roach & my review is my opinion."}
{"text":"Nicest guy ever, owner operator, helper for Mediterranean novices.  My wife and I shared a Gyro, pretty standard, comfortable fare for noobs, and it was right up there, but the three meat platter was bomb.  Lamb, Chicken and Beef, SOOO well seasoned, rice included that was fantastic.  We also ordered the hummus plate, which was huge, 4 adults sharing it for an app and there was leftovers.  My Bro ordered the stuffed pastry appetizers (traditional Mediterranean, but the name escapes me at the moment), it was delicious, too.  On a whim we got the potato soup and the lentil soup (FEASTED) and it was phenomenal, especially the lentil curry. My bro's 11 month old grubbed on it, too.  I didn't have the baklava myself, but reviews from in-laws raved.  Everything is made in-house and they do it right.  It's way off the beaten path from just about any tourist destination in Phoenix, but totally worth the drive.  It's in a strip mall, which I have come to appreciate as places were people with good food, but not a lot of money hide some very tasty restaurants."}
{"text":"I loved this place the owner was wonderful took the time to explain the menu he even made us something that wasn't on the menu. The free soup was delicious as well as all the food or feast that we ate. Ninos came over to check on us he really wanted our feed back he also told us about the vegetarian menu he was working on. The next day I was thinking about Good Fellas and it felt like you were at Ninos house for dinner not a restaurant. I recommend that every body tries Good Fellas I know you will be hooked like I am."}
{"text":"Food is always on point.  Free soup while you wait?  sure! Pretty sure that's what draws my bf to this place,  the lentil soup. Lol. Anyway,  good portions,  quality,  and service"}
{"text":"With all the hype and great things said about this place, why wouldn't I try a little Good Fellas Grill.  In addition, I was looking for something a little on the healthy side, and this somewhat meets that criteria.  OH MY GOSH!  Isn't that hummus and baba ganoush amazing?  The owner split our plate in half so we could enjoy this excellent dip.  It packed flavor, freshness, and a delicious spread on top of my pita.  The wifey and I were not able to finish it, and I would have to be so bold to say that it even tasted better the following day.  No way?  Oh yes way, my friend!  There is a ton of hype on the lentil soup, but I would have to say the potato soup had more flavor and was definitely more hearty than the lentil.  Therefore, I would highly recommend trying the potato as well.  The wifey had salad wraps while I had the 2 meat combo.  Since my wife did not share the wraps, I am sure they were delicious, as she kept them to herself.  The 2 meat combo is like the combo punch and kick you would see watching old school batman with the words saying, \"bam, pow, or crunch!\"  Meaning, the meat, the chicken, with the rice, onions, and tomato make for a treat for excitement.  It definitely lives up to its hype and adds on to another great Greek Restaurant in Phoenix!  We will see you again!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent, but the service is phenomenal! They make you feel like part of the family right when you walk through the door!!  Everything is made from scratch! I  recommend the hummus, its huge and so delicious!!"}
{"text":"I tried this place about a month ago and was blown away. The owners were very friendly and gave us soup to try for free and an extra piece of baklava for free. The chicken was so moist I immediately wondered if it was cooked all the way. It is incredible that chicken can be fully cooked and still so moist. The owner told us he has a secret process for cooking the chicken that keeps it so moist. The falafel seemed to taste a bit different than what I'm used to but it was still good. There wasn't anything I tried that I didn't like. I would eat here all the time if I lived closer."}
{"text":"I love middle east food, Good Fellas have a good selection and the food is awesome. The owner Ninos is very nice and cheerful.  EA"}
{"text":"Great service, and Ninos is so nice. He made me some tabbouleh and it wasn't in the menu. The prices were a bit high, but I don't mind paying for great service and good food. Overall a great experience and I'll go back, and it's nice to see this location has a good middle eastern restaurant finally."}
{"text":"I couldn't quite pinpoint exactly what made my meal so above average...but definitely the flavor, quality, detail and great customer service tornado that I believe had me in awe of my good food stupor Good Fellas Grill put me in tonight.  I kept thinking of what that special something was after I had my meal here tonight... The only words that came out of my mouth tonight were: Mmm...sooo good...TASTY...mmm...sooo goooood ...Taasty  Lentil Soup = BEST soup ever... like  the best creamy chicken base with lentils pureed in.  free.  Chicken Potato Soup = ALSO ties for BEST soup ever.  A chicken-brothy soup with moist pieces of chicken and tender potato.  They are sure to give you some chili paste to mix in to only make a great soup even greater.  free.  Salad = romaine mix with chunks of tomato and cucumbers with what has to be their own recipe greek-tasting vinaigrette  Gyro Meat = moist with those perfect crispy edges, a little meat juice. Sandwich Pita = perfection in a pita, perfectly grilled possibly with butter for great flavor.  Yogurt sauce = just right thickness major dill  I will be back for this sauce.  It is definitely their own recipe and it is a major star.  Chicken Kabob = perfectly cooked, not overcooked, chunks of juicy chicken breast marinated in greek seasoning of some sort and lemon...think lemonpeppergreekseasoned.  Rice = again perfectly cooked, not overcooked, large bed of white rice.  They shove another little cup of chicken broth for you to swim your rice in because they think they know what is good... they truly do though... we took home the other 2 cups of rice left on the plate pured that chicken broth all over it and are dreaming today about eating it tomorrow.  That good.  Pistachio Bird's Nest = Light crispy phyllo with that good inner juiciness of syrup that pops in your mouth only when you bite into it.  Service = excellent son and father that made sure we had anything and everything we needed all with a friendly demeanor that is more often than not non-existent.  Go here... I love me some Greek Wraps but this place has it's own special charm and flavor."}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you this place is as good as it gets in this side of town , no no, this side of the world. This is pretty g*d d*am authentic and the prices are reasonable.   Owners are Syrian and it shows with the hospitality. I would highly recommend this place for anyone whose been and needs a quick trip back to memory lane. Order the hummus if you don't believe me.   I received complimentary soup and it was enough to make me cancel my meal. Thank the falafel gods I didn't. Go and go early and often."}
{"text":"I saw this place about a month ago on my first trip to Chino Bandido (which btw is totally overrated and the food isn't that great). But enough about Chino, this review is about good food at Good Fellas. My wife and I were looking for something different and for a reasonable price. We found Good Fellas and the reviews were great so we thought we'd try it out. Were we ever impressed!  The owner, if you haven't read, is a great guy, extremely personable and wants to make sure you are satisfied with your dining experience. He suggested a couple of dishes and we ordered them. My wife had the Chicken Sandwich and I had the 2 Meat Platter. We also ordered the hummus, which came with a side of hot pita. The owner, Ninos, gave us a complimentary bowl of soup with our order.  I thought they were both tasty but I preferred the chicken and potato curry over the lentil.  The hummus was fresh and full of flavor.  When our food arrived, I couldn't believe how much food there was. A heaping mound of rice, a twelve inch piece of grilled beef and 6 or 7 hunks of chicken.  After the soup and hummus, I felt myself slowing down early and I'm usually a big eater.  The food was so flavorful and the portions were awesome for the price you pay.  Our meal was right around $22 and was some of the best money I've spent on food in a while.  I'll definitely be heading back for good food at Good Fellas soon."}
{"text":"I am sooo lucky to live right down the road from Good Fellas Grill!  My daughters and I are literally obsessed with the food and level of service.  Excellent, treats us like family, I wish we were family so that I could steal the recipes for some of my favs.  With all of the trendy,  chain places that serve(real)  middle eastern food,  this place is a breathe of fresh air.    Thanks you Ninos and family for bringing some quality and your wonderful personalities and great service to my neighborhood.   We  always enjoy everything,  if you are a newbie,  try out the gyro,falafel,  the rice for sure,  the curry potato chicken soup.  I could drink the tzatiki sauce its so good.  The tahini is tangy like it should be and not bland and boring.  They are always adding to their menu,  new vegetarian choices.  LOVE THEM!!!!  I am one lucky girl,,  now we can have it delivered,  and who shows up??  Ninos himself,  Makes me feel special.    Again, we love this place, I would give them more than 5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good stuff about GoodFellas. The food is amazing, and SO CHEAP. Free soup? Yes! The lamb kofte is just... amazing. I usually don't even like lamb, and my \"I hate meat\" vegetarian kiddo scarfs it up. Ignore the somewhat gnarly strip mall that GoodFellas is in and come enjoy the lunch special... three kinds of meat, salad, rice, and soup for like $6. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the neighborhood and was craving some gyros and then randomly realized that I drove past this place that had a gyros sign so I decided to give it ago. Boy am I glad I did that! This was my first time and definitely will not be my last. My friend and I got a couple different things and weren't disappointed. I had the gyro with a side of fries and it was heaven. It seems like this place is family owned which makes it even better. The girl at the front was very friendly and helped us decide what to get. She also offered us some soup while we waited which was super nice as most places don't do that kind of stuff anymore.  We got the food togo this time because I live so close and man was it good. I live within a mile so I will definitely be coming again in the near future. It was reasonably priced for the portions and the flavor. I am so excited to have stumbled upon this place!"}
{"text":"We love Greek food & we're always open to trying a new place. Good Fellas definitely didn't let us down. The owner greeted us when we walked in & asked if it was our 1st time there. He asked what we like & suggested a couple items. My boyfriend ordered the 3 meat plate that comes with steak, chicken, ground beef & rice. I ordered the 2 meat plate that comes with chicken, ground beef & rice. Both meals came with fresh pita bread & some sauce. The owner was very nice & gave us 2 bowls of chicken curry potato soup to try on the house. Neither of us has had Greek soup before & wow was it great! I had no idea what I was missing. All of the meats were delicious, perfectly cooked & seasoned. I was a little leery about the ground beef but it didn't disappoint, it was great as well.  Overall we were very pleasantly surprised and will definitely be back again.   They also have a check in coupon so it saves you 20% off an entrée plate. I hope they get a lot of business so they stay open and we can dine often!"}
{"text":"The best kabobs in Phoenix oh and also the potato soup is to die for make sure you try it . I come her 3 times a Month and every time it only tastes better ."}
{"text":"You cannot beat the everyday lunch special for $5.99 Not just a weekday special either! 3 meats, rice, salad, pita bread with garlic sauce and a bowl of lentil or potato soup. Food is excellent.  Restaurant is clean and service is good."}
{"text":"I read so many rave reviews here on Yelp, in fact, was very impressed by all the positive remarks, so I finally came in for dinner.  Hubby made some doubting comment about \"Well, if those reviews are valid...\"  Our experience was exactly as already described, being greeted by Ninos, getting menu recommendations, free soup, etc, so I won't bore you with all that.  That's an unbelievably awesome way to run a business and couldn't believe he does that with everybody.  Smiles all around, hubby very happy!   JUST GO HERE.  The food is great and plentiful.  The restaurant is clean and bright, much brighter than you'd expect from the rather sketchy strip mall location.  Menu is basic (as in no flaming saganaki, ha ha)  but hits all the right notes in terms of Greek and Mediterranean \"fast food\". We had what Ninos recommended, the 2- meat platter and the gyro platter.  Oh, both soups were good but I liked the lentil better.    My votes would be 1. gyro meat, so tender and good spice, 2. chicken, and then 3. the beef.   Also had the boorack and hubby loved them.  BTW, he ordered baklava before we even ordered entrees!  whoa, and it was delicious; a little dry/flaky, but that's personal preference.  [We like our baklava super sticky with honey!]  Please, Yelp seems to be their main advertising.  Run, don't walk, and please keep this place open!   they even deliver, which on this upcoming super-cold weekend (Jan 11-14), wouldn't that be great?     We will go back to make sure we weren't dreaming, and to start working our way around the menu.  We need to try the hummus to truly decide.  Just a nice, friendly, filling, fast, relaxed place to chow down."}
{"text":"Good fellas is honest simple home cooked goodness! Delicious and a savory dishes. We tried the 2 meat platter and the gyros. The meats were cooked to perfection, tender moist and spiced perfectly. The potato/chicken soup was the best soup any of us have had in along time.The service was friendly and enthusiastic. The dining area is simple and clean."}
{"text":"Good Fellas Grill is on the NW corner of Greenway and 19th Avenue just north of Twins Barber Shop.    I ordered the #4 and Chef's Special to go.  The #4 is the Kafta and comes with two skewers of ground beef with rice, pita bread, tomatoes, and onions.  The beef was flavored nicely but had a bit of a chew to it.  I would have liked it to have been a little more tender.  They give you enough rice to share with a friend.  I liked the meal and the portion size but I would have preferred to have some kind of sauce on the side.  It was good but a little on the dry side.  The Chefs Special came with half a salad, half rice, and grilled chicken.  Again, the portion was huge.  Lots of rice,large salad, and a good amount of chicken.  I didn't love the flavor of the chicken but the rice tasted good.    As I waited for my food I was given free soup and that was a very nice gesture seems how I wasn't dining in.   I would come back to try more items but I would definitely ask for some kind of sauce on the side and perhaps try something else."}
{"text":"We love their food. We think it's the best Greek takeout in Deer Valley. The gyro platters are delicious. Good Fellas is also run by some really friendly people."}
{"text":"I am shocked that we hadn't tried this place before now.  The food was great and the service was great and actually really kind!  My son has allergies and they were specific to reassure us and check our items for him.  The Lentil soup was perfect as was everything else that the group of us ordered!  The portions were even larger than we expected.  Very nice staff (family I think).  Will definitely continue going."}
{"text":"Love this place!  You get soup with every meal that is so delicious.  The chicken platters are amazing and sometimes they have a chicken pita special with fries for super cheep.  Love, love the hummas!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try Good Fellas based on the great reviews.  First, the positives: the staff was very friendly and the interior of the restaurant is a lot nicer than the facade would imply.  A couple of patrons were taking a bunch of menus so that they could tell all their friends to try the restaurant-a good sign I thought. So I ordered a gyro and was given a complimentary chicken curry soup. Nice.  The soup was delivered piping hot, a little blah, but it went down nicely none the less.  The gyro arrived a short time later and here is where the disappointment set in.  The pita was stale and the portion of meat was a bit on the skimpy side.  I would have preferred a bit more tzatziki too.  Whaddya want for seven bucks though. Given that my fave gyro place is just a bit further north than Good Fellas, I likely won't return."}
{"text":"Food is excellent! Family owned and they're very nice. We ordered the Hummus plate, Spanikopita, and the 2 meat plate (gyros and chicken). The chicken was incredibly moist and flavorful, the gyros was excellent and our absolute favorite is the hummus! A must try"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a rainy night on one of our semi-annual trips to Phoenix for NASCAR, when we try to visit a new restaurant each time.  This was close enough to our hotel and right next door to one of our perennial favorites, Chino Bandido.  This family-owned, family-staffed restaurant offers Middle Eastern/Greek/Mediterranean type fare - gyros, baba gannouj, etc.  The BF had the gyro plate, which is the go-to Mid. East. meal for his limited palate.  He enjoyed it very much - thinly sliced meat served with relatively plain rice.  What I liked most about it was the sauce:  not the typical over-tart tzatziki, but a more mellow version containing dill.  I had the tabbouleh salad, which I think may be the best version I have eaten - not overly puckery with lemon, with lots of chopped tomato and onion.  I also had the mushroom-and-potato boorak....and it was SO GOOD!  Four pieces of the pastry, with a crisp brown bread crust, came atop a small salad of romaine and tomato - I could eat that dish all the time.  I'm sure we'll be adding this place to our \"regulars\" list!  (BTW - one point subtracted for having a leaky ceiling with no bucket or sign or any other warning - I stood underneath the spot accidentally and received a brief christening.)"}
{"text":"Now don't expect a lot of ambiance, but clean is my perfection and this place is IT!  Plus the food is wonderful...it is family owned and run, the recipes are family through and through.  If you like Syrian/Mediterranean dishes, this place is for you.  Everyone on staff are there to please you in every way.  Food is freshly prepared to order.  It is served to you quickly if you dine in and soup comes complimentarily with your entree (I recommend the lentil.mmmmmmm).  Even the American style burgers and fries are great.  Sometimes this is a craving that becomes a fix I need to eat!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Greek food in Arizona!  This hole in the wall is a hidden gem or shall I say diamond.  Service is outstanding.  I had the hummus appetizer and the three meat entrée. So much flavor and TLC in every bite.  To top it all off you get a starter bowl of soup free. I had the chicken curry which was amazing. I will try lentil next time.  Love this place and will surely spread the word and return!"}
{"text":"Came here because the reviews looked great! I was very disappointed! Lets just say $50 not well spent. The only thing I enjoyed was the lentil soup that was on the house."}
{"text":"We love the service here and the tasty food. The hummus is very creamy an delicious and they serve you soup with every meal. The meats are always seasoned very tasty. The workers are so helpful and always in a great mood. My favorite is their hummus and koftas."}
{"text":"Great food awesome lunch special place is a hidden gem it's clean great taste non greasy and awesome rice"}
{"text":"Went with the gyro combo meal, which has a gyro, fries, and a drink. The gyro was pretty good, but could probably use a little more sauce. The fries were also pretty good, some of them were a little undercooked. Everyone that worked there was nice. The person that I assume is either the manager or the owner offered me soup while I was waiting. The seating area was basically empty, so either it was slow or they don't have a lot of business. I would recommend other to it, I will be going back to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Great place, definitely go combo 7! The ppl are very nice and friendly there. Love it!"}
{"text":"A rare five-star rating for the combination of price and quality of food.  Our party of 25 was promptly seated and cups distributed so we could get our drinks right away.  If that wasn't enough, she started us off with their amazing soups!  The orders were all accurate and everyone was happy.  We had a great meal and people were extremely hospitable.  Thank you again!"}
{"text":"This quaint little restaurant offers Mediterranean and Greek cuisine at its best!  Ninos and family do an awesome job of satisfying every customer. The hummus (yum!) is so delicious. One can fill up on that and the pita bread alone. The chicken and potato soup is great for any appetite. The entrée consisted of the three meat combo with rice and a salad.  No one can finish a meal such as this! Oh how quickly this place has become a favorite!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent! The hummus and pita were really good. The ribeye steak kabob was awesome. Free chicken and potatoe soup was hot and yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Im going down a star because i ordered some today for dinner and it was a tad disappointing. Falafels were hard as rocks, no flavor and it was straight up chickapea,  Hurt the roof of my mouth.  Hummus was good  The pita was soft but i am a vegetarian and the falafes are my main meal. I am kind of sad and disappointed on how hard and non appetizing these were."}
{"text":"Being from the suburbs its always hard to judge by a drive by of the store front. Inside is clean, food is spot on and everyone was friendly.  The lunch crowd was all business suits and ties. We will be back for sure.  The chicken was the best followed by the gyro meat."}
{"text":"Delicious. Super affordable. Friendly. Clean. Awesome.   I recommend the lentil soup. Man, was it good."}
{"text":"22 miles from my house and worth the trip!  lentil soup, gyros, kabobs, hummus, etc.  Everything is just terrific!  Owner is the nicest guy you'll ever meet.  So are his wife & teenage kids."}
{"text":"I recommend this place. Quite place, delicious food and friendly staff. I stayed in Phoenix for two days and I went to this place both days to have dinner. You must need to try the desert."}
{"text":"If you've been to (or heard of) Chino Bandido in north Phoenix, you know it's essentially a valley institution.  Whether you come to their 19th Ave and Greenway location for lunch or dinner, you can expect a parking lot packed with Chino patrons and a long line of customers in their restaurant to match.  And yet literally right next door to Chino is a restaurant that might be even more praiseworthy even though word is only starting to get around about it.  As I write this, Good Fellas Grill is currently ranked as the 9th highest rated restaurant in the entire Phoenix metropolitan area.  Higher than Chino Bandido, higher than Postino, higher than all but 8 restaurants.  96% of reviewers to this point have given this place 4 star ratings or better (72% of which have given them 5 stars).  That's my cue to come here during lunch on a Friday.  As expected, the parking lot was packed when I arrived.  I expected at least some of the traffic to be flowing into this place instead of Chino, but nope.  Almost completely dead with just four other customers there.  It's a pretty simple setup with seating for probably 40-50, some TVs showing sports channels and some Mediterranean artwork on the wall.  Here you just walk up to the counter, order, and seat yourself.  Always the one to go full throttle at a new restaurant, I ordered their biggest dish:  The 3 meat combo.  A huge plate of rice with skewers of chicken, ribeye, and rolled ground beef.  Comes with tomatoes and onions on the side and you get pita bread and tzatziki sauce to boot.  To my pleasant surprise, they offered me a free bowl of chicken potato soup with my order (you can also choose lentil).  Total cost for the food and a fountain drink came out to $17.  Most of their menu items here are $10 or less and they have lunch specials on sandwiches and salads for about $5.  Food came out to me in less than 10 minutes.  First off, the soup.  Came out hot, but not spicy.  It had some decent chunks of chicken and potato and some various seasonings that I could pick up on.  Very refreshing soup.  Not a thick soup like chicken and dumplings, but hearty with a tasty broth.  Next, the main event.  A plate full of meat.  Like the soup, the meats weren't really spicy, but had some great seasonings and I'm pretty sure all the meats (as well as the rice) had a nice dousing of olive oil.  The pita bread was very fresh and the tzatziki was a cool, clean, refreshing compliment to the meats.  I actually wish they had given me more of that sauce.  My favorite meat in the bunch was unquestionably the chicken.  Nicely cooked with just a light char and great seasonings.  The ground beef log was a little odd looking as it wasn't quite a sausage but not quite a burger.  Still a very tasty dish and both it and ribeye went great with the tzatziki.  When all was said and done I was in and out in 30 minutes and left stuffed and happy.  One tip for Yelpers is that they actually have a pretty expansive vegetarian menu (far moreso than their website advertises).  When you walk up to the counter look up and to your right and you'll see the long list of vegetarian menu items they have near the ceiling.  The guy who took my order spoke just enough English to take my order, but just bear in mind that there might be a little bit of a language barrier.  The staff there was very friendly and professional so it didn't hinder the experience at all.  And trust me when I say this place is nothing like Pita Jungle.  Some of the same foods are served here, but from my experience the quality (and the price) is even better at Good Fellas.  So bravo Yelpers, you win again.  I have yet another lunch spot near work I can call my own.  Next time you're there, just be sure and get a double order of that tasty tzatziki."}
{"text":"Great place for authentic Greek food.   The free lentil soup is wonderful and the gyro plate is excellent.   My boyfriend always gets the three meat plate and loves it.   I advise walking right past Chino bandito and going here instead."}
{"text":"I finally had the opportunity to take the whole family to enjoyed homey greek/mediterranean food.  It was a success.  The twins tried everything and those are some picky eaters.  I love the lentil soup, and I have told before in other reviews, I am not a soup person but this one is so delicious.  I guess I must have become a soup person, but I digress.  My chicken was so tender and marinated to perfection.  My little girl ate all her portion plus some of her brother's chicken.  THey both enjoyed the rice.  I was supposed to be off of carbs this week, but I couldn't pass up this one.  It is perfectly cooked rice.  The garlic sauce that comes with the chicken goes so well with it.  My hubby had a salad with some gyro meat on it.  He really enjoyed it.  The only bad thing is that this place is so far from us.  I could see having take out at least a couple of times a week, if I live closer."}
{"text":"Where do you get amazing Middle Eastern/Greek food on the west coast?! Good Fellas, of course! Went here about a month ago while I was in the area and wanted some tasty food, and was not disappointed.   On my first visit, I went all out (yes, my eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach, and it doesn't help that they have pictures of their food -- lol). So I ordered the gyro platter, the Fattoosh Salad (seriously the BEST one I've had in a long time), the 2 Meat Combo with Beef and Chicken, and I wanted the Hummus so badly (get it! It's made in-house!!!) but couldn't decide... so the amazing staff gave me a small plate of Hummus on the house! How awesome are they?! Super amazingly awesome!   While waiting for your food to be prepared, they serve you this finger-licking good Lentil Soup (don't really stick your fingers in though, it's soup so it's hot!) It looks kind of weird (it's green), but don't knock it til you try it -- I'm telling you, your tastebuds will thank you!   Not long after getting the Lentil soup, the food came out! (Great food, amazing service, and short wait?! Yes, please!) The complementary Hummus was absolutely divine. Pretty sure I licked the plate clean (with the use of the pita bread served along with it). Then the Fattoosh Salad -- wow! Absolutely phenomenal; my mouth is watering as I think about it. So yum! The ingredients are so fresh and crispy and then the dressing has the perfect flavor and tangy-ness to it; all the flavors marry perfectly.   Then the main entrees: 2 Meat Combo and Gyro Platter. Oh.Em.Gee. The meat with both entrees was so tender and flavorful, perfectly cooked. Seriously you don't even really have to chew it, it's so tender it will melt in your mouth. And the rice?! I didn't know rice could taste so good... add some sumac to it as well for an extra treat; you're welcome!   Needless to say, I couldn't eat all of the food I ordered so I took some home in hopes of having an amazing meal the next day -- but the food didn't last through the night. (Yes, I was a fatty and ate the rest of it that night. Lol)  I had such an awesome experience and the food was so amazing that I specifically drove there again last night to have their Fattoosh Salad (yes, it's THAT good), and I ventured out and tried their Lettuce Wraps as well. The Fattoosh Salad of course did not disappoint; I'm just sad that I didn't grab a fork to go so I could dig in as soon as I left, lol. The Lettuce Wraps were just as delish! The chicken had the perfect seasoning on it, and the sauce had a nice flavor with a slight kick to go along with the lettuce... Very nice combination of flavors!   I think it's safe to say that as long as Good Fellas will be around, they've gained a customer for life!!!"}
{"text":"I don't write reviews often, but their customer service is excellent and the food was incredible! I ordered pickup on yelp and that service didn't even call them with the order. So fyi just call in your orders directly but seriously, I didn't catch the lady up fronts name, but she was awesome! I didn't mind the extra wait while they fired up my order asap!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious with wonderful service, food and a simple menu that always hits the spot."}
{"text":"This place rocks! If you want a great meal at a great price, go to Good Fellas Grill. I have been here at least 10 times now, and the food and service is always great. The atmosphere is nothing fancy, but very comfortable. You cannot beat the free lentil soup. I almost always get the lunch special, which is typically 3 meats, 1/2 a side of rice, and a small dinner salad. I usually have some leftovers, so for 8 bucks I get 2 terrific meals. The meat is always tender and moist, love it."}
{"text":"The free lentil soup is surprisingly full of flavor!  I got the two meat plate. The meat was juicy and tender.  My only complaint about is with the rice. It needed a bit of salt, and more of a bite to it.   Great value. Would come again"}
{"text":"Ok, first review for me....so here goes.  If you're looking for the best Gyro in this area, look no further.  Believe me, I have tried them all.  Before GFG, I was a Chicago Gyro/King Gyro guy for North Central Phoenix.  THEN......I went just around the corner.  The family running it is as friendly as can be and have 2x offered me soup while I wait for my delicious order to go.  Today, the kids even offered a warm \"Hello\" as I walked in the door to grab lunch.    I know all gyro meat in PHX seems to be \"oddly\" alike, so usually it is all about the Pita and the filling.  Not so much here.  The gyro meat is amazing.  So tender, so delicious.  Best I've had before.  And then, the pita is incredible, onions thinly sliced, roma tomoatoes......mmmmmm......sooooo good.  I want another already.  Fries, which are ever so important, are just ok.  I wish more places would figure out that if I need to wait another 3 minutes for crispy fries, I will wait every damn minute patiently.  I will branch off into other items soon, but the gyro is so damn good I will be back repeatedly."}
{"text":"Delicious food, Awesome Customers Service,, and Delicious Food.  Oh, I already said that.  lol.  You can go and taste it yourself.  Yummy.  I\"m addicted :)"}
{"text":"We tried this place out on a whim and was pleasantly surprised by the great food and service.  The owner, Ninos, was very helpful in giving suggestions. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich which was lightly seasoned with Mediterranean spices. I enjoyed it, but the real key players were the falafel (slightly crispy and wonderfully tasty), the chicken curry soup, and the sauteed chicken with long grain rice. The chicken was perfection, and I rarely like chicken as most places overcook it until it's dry like shoe leather. Everything was wonderfully flavored and has blown every other Greek restaurant out of the water. We wanted to try some of the pastry desserts but ended up being too full. I will definitely return.  To sum up this review, have you ever seen the movie Accepted? My experience here reminds me of this scene:  Bartleby: What the hell happened? Glen (who is in a lab coat covered in spices): An explosion of flavor! I'm working with some very unstable herbs.  Seriously. Good Fellas sure knows their spices."}
{"text":"I was looking for some decent Mediterranean food nearby and came across this spot. It is family owned and run by dad the kids I believe. It is a neat spot and very welcoming. The place is clean and the girl at the front was helpful and friendly. I was craving and looking for a chicken shawarma wrap or plate which they did not have as an option on their menu.  I  settled for the Gyro combo plate which was not disappointing.  The meat was seasoned really well and juicy.  The rice was rich, light and fluffy.  My only thumbs down is the pita bread they provide which is the same one I find at rhe stores.  That didn't impress me much.    They also give you a heavy portion for the combo plates.  Definitely enough to share with another person.  They are also kind enough to provide 2 different options of soup on the house while you wait for your food.  I had the lentil soup which was delicious.  They should be charging for their soups.  I would come back to try something else on the menu.  Maybe next time eat in."}
{"text":"Wow. Stopped by for a quick lunch and was blown away by the tastes. Nice clean facility... except bathroom. Food is outstanding. Got the lunch special. Chicken very tender...excellent. Salad dressing very good. They provide lentil or potato chicken soup free if eating in... had the lentil ..flavor is outstanding. Gyro is great and so is the ground beef kabob. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great food, good service and affordable. I've been in this place once a week fir the last few months and never a bad meal."}
{"text":"Okay. I'm a huge fan of Greek and other Mediterranean foods. When I saw this place and all the five star reviews, of course I figured it was worth checking out (despite it being next door to Chino Bandido - I still shudder when I think about how severe the food poisoning was that my wife and I got from that place a couple of years ago). Before I begin, this review started at 3 stars in my mind, went up to four and then back down to three. Explanation follows.  As with so many other Yelpers, I was immediately greeted upon entering the (empty at the time) establishment by a man who I assume was Ninos - and so for the rest of this review that's what I'll call him (even if it wasn't actually Ninos). Because this week I returned to my as-vegetarian-and-low-carb-as-possible diet, I was after something like falafels or dolmas for lunch. Ninos saw me looking at the menu and offered some suggestions. I asked for some sort of vegetarian type thing, like perhaps a platter, and he said he could actually design something for me - falafel on a bed of hummus. I thought of perhaps a little tabbouleh to go with it and he said it might not be able to do that, then ducked into the kitchen briefly - seconds later he reappeared with another dude and they both greenlighted the tabbouleh. The dolmas could have been part of my meal too, but I was advised that these are made to order and I figured I didn't need them that bad. We went with a custom order of falafel, tabbouleh and hummus. Ninos also asked if I liked eggplant, then said he could offer me a small sample of eggplant and potato on the house, which I gratefully accepted.  Finally, while I was waiting, Ninos offered me a bowl of lentil soup. At this point, despite the fact that I'm not really into soup (especially in the Phoenix summertime) I mentally raised my rating of Good Fellas to 4 stars. The soup was hot as hell, and not too bad (as lentil soups go). Seems to me that it's more of a wintertime dish, but I'm no soup connoisseur.  Several other people started arriving at the lunch hour and then my food was ready. Ninos opened the container to show me. A standard flat square takeout container with the main course, and a housebrick-sized one with tabbouleh (which was pretty much enough tabbouleh to feed at least four people - way more than I was after). Main here (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CV0knwCFA-x-8jJHot6Few?select=VXmx9i2VaxpYwg5k795Tmg), tabbouleh here (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CV0knwCFA-x-8jJHot6Few?select=iTuZQ7AB-acpYIbdxaFCrA).  The total price came to just over $16. Later on, mulling over this fact is what reduced my final rating. Very much overpriced for what I was after - double my typical lunch cost.  Taste-wise: the hummus was very nice and creamy, better than most I've had. The falafels, as you can see from the photo, looked like mini donuts. Strange, but also very nice - did not taste like the store-mix stuff (reminiscent of wet beach sand) that you find in falafels from places like Chicago Gyros or JT Gyros. Tabbouleh was good, but there was simply too much of it. This was supposed to be lunch for one person; I had to discard more than 3/4 of the T. Finally, the eggplant and potato was nice and reminded me of the ep/spicy potato/tzatziki/lettuce/tomato/cheese kebabs that I used to get from Saidoun in North Sydney Shoppingworld's food court. Back when it existed, that is.  The price was somewhat my fault, I suppose, for not ordering directly from the menu nor indicating my desired quantity. Breaking it down: Greek Wraps give you two falafels for a buck; six would have been three bucks. Hummus; I can get almost double the amount for about $3.99 from Fry's, albeit perhaps not as fresh. Tabbouleh is cilantro, parsley, bulgur wheat and a coupla other cheap things. I would have been happy with far less of it and a price of perhaps $8-9 all up. Ninos rang up several items on the register so I think he may have believed that I got multiple full-size entrees items but my photos show what I received (minus the eggplant).  Whatever. I'll return for sure and next time I'll bring a few workmates. Props to Ninos for being personable and willing to cater for his customers, and for the above average flavor of the food. And thanks to Google I now know why the falafels are shaped like donuts - to prevent getting mealy in the middle. Neat idea. I'll try a meat dish next time; there could well be a fourth star yet in Good Fellas' future.."}
{"text":"Love the food and the owner!  This place is a true gem.  I like how when I asked for some suggestions the owner had a specific dish I should start with.  It was delicious!  #7 in case your wondering."}
{"text":"The food is soooo good, you get so much for the price of it that you will be stuffed all day on a small budget.   I definitely recommend, some of the better Gyro's that i have tried."}
{"text":"It's my first time writing review on yelp, I feel like this place deserves 5 star! Great owner,  clean, and best of all awesome food! I'll definitely be back! Thank you, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"After eating here today, all other Greek restaurants are dead to me...  The menu is simple enough with large pictures for someone like me who is not yet familiar with all the terminology when it comes to Greek food.  The owner was beyond friendly, and was willing to field questions as we stared at the menu making our decision.  My indecision brought me to the 2 meat plate, both the beef and the chicken were delicious.  Rice was great and plentiful, and we were even brought pita bread for our already enormous lunch.  I will definitely be back (with reinforcements).  I was only there an hour ago and I am already thinking about attacking my take-home box in the fridge."}
{"text":"This is actually the first time for me to try Mediterranean food. And loved it. Tried Hummus, chicken kabab and few others with a group. It was definitely best place to hang out. It was calm and simple place. Food was definitely good for everyone to try out, its like there food for every person from any part of the world!! Would recommend for sure."}
{"text":"The owner and his family are by far the nicest people you will ever meet. My mother and I try to eat here as often as we can because the food is AMAZING and the portions are huge. We always order the hummus, chicken lettuce wraps, and the three meat combo plate. I also have to order extra of their garlic sauce which is completely out of this world (best sauce EVER!). Oh and I can't forget to mention how delicious their complementary lintel soup is (uhhhhhhh it's to die for!) Lol! I definitely recommend this place. AMAZING FOOD AND AMAZING SERVICE!"}
{"text":"Yelp and Good Fellas  really came through for my family and I while we were off the beaten path looking for some good grub.  Good Fellas is very very good food.  They have a casual and comfortable atmosphere that is just about the food.  Try the two meat combo.  MMMMMM!  The lentil soup is excellant (try it with some lemon juice).  The only thing I did not like about the place is it is not in the east valley!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few dozen times over the years. I am offered a free bowl of lentil or potato soup 90% of the time and the owner is super friendly. Service is great. I have my (free) soup and then the food arrives. The food is good and is reasonably priced. Don't come here expecting a gourmet restaurant and criticize the ambiance inside when you arrive. I love reading yelp reviews where people try to be food critics. The place has a single dollar sign on yelp and is located on bell road. The place is incredible for what it is and the reviews speak for themselves."}
{"text":"Always a courteous welcome and a complimentary bowl of soup awaits you here. A wonderful feeling, too. It's cozy. In fact, it's a wonderful community feeling because it's obvious a family runs the joint. They acknowledge your presence when you enter and such, you know, make eye contact.  It's the little things that I appreciate. The hummus is wonderful and l crave it. It's nice. I think I'll watch the YouTube video \"All About that Paste\" as I wait.   They are professional and polite and the menu is clearly posted with images of enticing plates. There are large booths, azure motif walls, and several TVs (on a low volume) playing news."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and decided to try do to great reviews....they did not disappoint. Nino was very friendly and was helpful with his recommendations. My husband and I tried both their potato and lentil soup, both were great. We also had a 2 meat plate and a gyro with fries, which were Delicious. Amazing authentic Greek food at awesome prices."}
{"text":"Great, attentive service. Clean restaurant. A little hole-in-the-wall type place.   Got free chicken potato soup and free lentil soup to start with, both of which were great, but we're boiling hot when they came out (better than being cold). I had the chicken and ground beef kabob combo, which comes with rice and pita bread, as well as sliced tomatoes and onion on the side. My boyfriend has the chicken kabob platter. Good portions for the price.   20% off one entree or sandwich when you check in on Yelp or foursquare."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. Once for lunch and once for take-out dinner. It's definitely got that family-owned vibe.   They offer you a free lentil soup while you wait. (Even with take-out). For the love of god, take the free soup!  I'm a creature of habit, so I tend to order the same thing every-time I go somewhere. Here, it's the falafel sandwich and fries. I've had falafel sandwiches at other places, that are either super greasy or totally dry. Not the case here. It's got that perfect ratio. My tummy was happy."}
{"text":"Great food and personable proprietor. Tried because of good yelp reviews and will definitely be eating here again!"}
{"text":"This is a true hidden gem. Always fabulous food and wonderful service. Their chicken is absolutely amazing. I will still drive across town just for their food! You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Since my last visit that wasn't the best experience, the owner reached out to us via Yelp and offered to make things right. Although I have not been able to return to this restaurant to try out a different food item (due to moving out of the area), I thought the generosity of the owner was stellar. I appreciate owners taking the time out to really listen to the consumers. Its not done enough and I appreciate the effort. I have added one more star to my review because of it. I hope to return again to Good Fellas soon."}
{"text":"I dont know what these guys do with their chicken but its amazing! The gyros are the best in the valley. The soup is perfect.   The staff is outstanding as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My favorite item at the Good Fellas Grill is the Steak Shish Kabob. The meat is always perfectly cooked to medium temperature and very tasty. I take the meat off of the Shish Kabob and eat it with the rice. I don't know what kind of rice that they use, but it's really delicious. Their hummus is great and a perfect appetizer before diner. I also love the potato soup that is given out for free by Ninos, the owner of Good Fellas Grill.  Last time I was in Ninos had me cracking up as he was explaining how to say his name to my dinner companions (we were there for about 90 minutes). He touches his knee and says \"Knee\" and then touches his nose and says \"noes\"(not a typo). Knee Noes. That little skit was worth the price of admission. Everybody that I bring here loves the food. His prices are fair and the food is fabulous."}
{"text":"Good Fellas is the best!!!  My husband and I went in there today for lunch and it was probably our 10th time there and we have always been extremely impressed!    Today just so happens to be the one year anniversary of the restaurant opening... Congrats to Ninos and his family!  There is not a bad thing on the menu and it is EXTREMELY well priced.  We keep coming back to this place because it's the perfect combo of everything you'd want in a lovely restaurant.  Think Persian Room food at a quarter (sometimes even more) of the cost with a laid back atmosphere.  They have even added on a whole new vegetarian/vegan portion to their menu.  You can tell Ninos has a passion for what he does and provides top notch customer service and food to every customer that comes through the door.  You will be treated like family here.  Spread the word on this place to keep it around for a very long time!  It's places like this that are meant to be shared with everyone. :)"}
{"text":"All good. Great portions. Full hummus and pita, gyro salad, falafels and a drink for under $23. Had to take some hummus and falafels home. The pitas kept coming. Know how you have to order a few extra pitas and sometimes you're charged for them, b/c they only give you one for a lot of food. Not the case here!  Pita for days.   Really good tasting all around. Did I mention the complementary soup?  Potato something and Lentil, both good and a nice little surprise.   Make sure you go there keep this little gem in business.   Are you still reading this?  Get up and go there, please. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Man I tell you every time I go there the Ninos knows my name and knows what I want ( sure that makes me predictable but whatever ) the food is always always top notch. I have no idea what he does with his fries but damn they're good. Sometimes I have to drive around the place because rash time I go by I find myself drawn in. A+ service and A+ on the food :)"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Best mediterranean in phoenix. The owner and staff are just as great as the food. We went twice in one week.Keep it up Ninos! You are doing it right!"}
{"text":"First visit but it won't be my last.  Today, was my first visit to Good Fellas Grill, but it won't be my last .  All I have to say is you can't go wrong with any of the  menu selections at Good Fellas Grill.   At Good Fellas grill you are offered a complimentary bowl of soup with your entree.  Today, I selected the chicken and potato soup and my lunch companion had the lentil soup.  Both soups were delicuous. The  chicken and potato soup is loaded with chicken and potatoes.  Both soups were very flavorful , and so satisfying.   From the gyro sandwich to the chicken lettuce wrap, every entree was delicious and brusting with flavorful. On my next visit I want  to try the sautéed chicken it is served with, basmati rice, tomato slices and sweet onions and it looks delicious l.  The food and service are amazing, and did I mention lunch specials start at $5.99.  So if your looking for a  great value, fresh made to order meals,  in a comfortable environment, then look no further then Good Fellas Grill."}
{"text":"Stopped in here today for lunch with my boyfriend. I ordered the chicken kebab meal and he ordered a traditional gyro meal. The counter person offered us complimentary soup while we wait, so I had the lentil soup. The soup had nice spice and well cooked green lentils. My chicken kebabs we're AMAZING! They we're very juicy and had delicious seasoning. The rice with the meal was perfectly cooked and nicely spiced. The salad was fresh, although the dressing wasn't my favorite. I sampled my boyfriend's gyro, the meat had a nice oregano flavor and was tender. The pita bread tasted homemade, which is not too common and tastes so much better than premade. They also give pita bread with a garlic dip with meals which I thought was a nice touch. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Honestly I can't think of one complaint. No matter what time of day, the owner is always there with a smile on his face. The food is top  notch, chicago delicious.  I love the plates- chicken, kafta, gyros, or beef (ribeye). The rice is always fresh and cooked to perfection with just the right flavor. The soups(lentil and potato) always hit the spot. Again, very flavorful, delicious and healthy!  I used to live down the street, and I'd sadly forget about this place. Now that Moved a few miles away, I keep coming back (twice this week already!)  If you're in the area, be sure to stop by!  Lunch specials too!  I love Good Fellas Grill!!"}
{"text":"What a breath of fresh fresh air. The owner of this restaurant actually took my constructive criticism and made some very positive changes based on them. How awesome is that?  Regarding the rice, apparently the staff who previously told me that they used chicken stock was misinformed. The owner showed me the seasoning they use and it is all veggie!  They're also now carrying a vegan lentil soup daily and it's delicious!  The pitas contain no dairy, which is awesome.  This place makes some great veggie food and the owner is very friendly and responsive to customer needs.  Definitely recommend that you check this place out!"}
{"text":"Good food, consistent... I like going when I'm in the area. They gave me soup on the house, tasted good... I would go again."}
{"text":"I have been walking past this place for years while eating at Chino Bandido next door.  Yesterday I had a craving for middle eastern food, so I decided to give Good Fellas a try.  I am so disappointed that I did not visit this place sooner!  First of all, the staff is among the nicest I have ever dealt with.  When I said it was my first time at their restaurant, they brought out samples of different dishes for me to try as I placed my order.  I never asked for this, but they insisted that I try samples to ensure I got a meal that I would like.  I was blown away by everything I tasted, and my meal was spectacular.  I have had a lot of ME food, and this place is THE BEST I have ever had.  Great service, AMAZING food, clean facility and reasonable prices.  It does not get much better than this."}
{"text":"Tucked inside a strip mall next to Safeway, this oddly named grill produces delicious plates of traditional Greek and Mediterranean food. We took the advertised lunch special, a deal-of-a-deal! Three meats plus 3 sides for $6. Each meat was tender; the total was satisfying. The pita helped slurp up the sides, and we were in and out within 30 minutes. If you are anywhere near North 19th, fairly near I 17, then it's a great stop and great little lunch."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, if it wasn't for Yelp (and Daren C), I would have probably never known that Good Fellas Grill existed and I would have never known the deliciousness I was missing! I've eaten here several times now and I am officially a fan! I love Mediterranean food and Good Fellas Grill lives up to my love. Everything here is juicy, fresh and delicious.  My favorite meal is the Mediterranean salad with either chicken or lamb. The meat is juicy with the perfect about of marination that makes it tasty with every bite. The salad is hefty and could easily be two meals. The salad dressing is salty and yummy! However, I will say that I'm a sucker for carbs and I love their buttery rice as well. I like to order a side of the rice. Other go-to items are the lentil soup and one of the meat dishes.   Good Fellas is a no-frills, homey food style place. It's perfect for lunch on the go, for a casual lunch or dinner with kids or just if you want to grab some takeout!   PS - it's right by Turf Paradise, so if you're there for the races, stop by on your way home!"}
{"text":"Wow this is Def the best place in the area for good food. The lovely woman at the counter let met try the chicken and potatoe soup while I waited. It was SO GOOD I order a bowl to go.  This place is a true gem.  I will be back any chance I get!"}
{"text":"I was a little leery about eating here during lent but the owner had it covered. Had a wonderfully delicious vegan lentil soup with some kind of curry in it. I don't think anyone in our group had a bad thing to say about it! I also had some type of bread with mushrooms & potatos inside that was kinda like a russian pyroski. As strange as it is to say the rice was probably tied with the soup as my favorite part of the meal. It was vegetarian and had a slight yellow color to it (maybe saffron?). All in all, it was a nice little place with a very caring accommodating staff, excellent prices, delicious food, & large portions."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmy. YUMMY!! I know good Mediterranean food and this place gets a huge gold star from me! I ordered the two meat combo, signature fries, and the chicken sandwich. The meat was so succulent and fresh, the fries melted in your mouth, and the rice was the perfect balance of fluffy and delicious. The service was excellent and you can feel the warmth and love that are put into the dishes they serve. You feel like family upon walking in and the staff even recommends their favorites if you're having a hard time deciding on what to order. The food speaks for itself though, this is a must try in the valley!"}
{"text":"Home made, authentic and fresh soul food. The customer service was genuine, and the cook is like your abuelita. It had my taste buds like whoa...and my kids aren't easy to please, and they too were impressed. I will be back."}
{"text":"Ok, great Greek food, at a great price. Not a 5 star place, but 5 star food, and 5 star service, and as long as the food is great, and the service is great do I really need anything else?  Wish I was going to be here longer to go back and have more. Would like to try more dishes, but flight is in an hour, so once is all I can go."}
{"text":"Omg , pretty darn good food in a comfy Lil joint! Made fresh, and if you eat in, you get free soup. Can not beat that!! The staff is pretty amazing also! Highly recommend visiting. Must try the specials and share with a friend!"}
{"text":"Food was great! And the lady who took our order was such a sweetheart! I wanted to give her a hug, she was so nice lol prices aren't too shabby either."}
{"text":"What a great little spot.  I got the #6 and there chicken was juicy and flavorful.  I like that they didn't put so much wasted garnish on the dishes.  They give you a perfect amount of chicken and rice.  The rice seemed a tad dry, maybe it wasn't fresh.    The put a bread they gave was ok.  Not sure if it's made fresh on site or not.  Very solid price.  Plenty of places to sit and very clean.  I will likely be back."}
{"text":"4.5 stars  Its a nice, clean, friendly little spot.  The 3 meat combo offers a good filling variety, leaving the option of making your own sandwhich. The rice was seasoned, either flavored from the meats served on top, or marinated separately.   Cant go wrong with the falafel combo.  The feast for 5 was great when we ordered it. More than enough, and the variety of food was definitely worth it. Arguably it could feed like 8."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this restaurant when I noticed a lunch special driving by. Family run business with excellent food (got the combo plate) and very reasonable prices. I wish they were closer but just might make the trip for the kefta."}
{"text":"While it is completely obvious that I love this place... I want to let you all in on a nice little lunch special.   $5.99 gets you a lunch sized meal of 7 of the most amazing things you can put in your mouth. YEP 7 perfectly flavored and seasoned eats!  1. Salad with fresh greens, cucumbers, cabbage, tomato's, and dressed with traditional dressing.  2. Bazmatti Rice, light and fluffy with a hint of seasoning.  3. Grilled Chicken kabob 2 hunks of the best chicken ever. 4. Generous portion of Gyro meat topped with Tzaeki sauce 5. 1/2 skewer of Kefta which is a grilled beef seasoned like no other 6. Pita bread, enough to eat with all the meats 7. Garlic spread to add on the Pita...gotta try this! 8  WHAT YEP A BONUS... if you eat in you will get FREE Chicken potato or Lentil soup.   I would like you to show me a better deal at CHINO??"}
{"text":"I loved it! The food is authentic. The owner, Ninos, a Chicago native himself spoiled me! Everything was good. The soups, the Kabobs and the shwarma, everything. It feels like home. Thanks Ninos!"}
{"text":"This a hidden Jem!! Best kabobs in Phoenix!! As a bonus, the service is outstanding! They truly care for the customer and the food they prepare. Don't miss this one!!"}
{"text":"At first, we weren't sure what to think. The service seemed less than satisfactory. Then, that same employee did a complete 180 and ended up being the sweetest lady we'd met all week. My wife and I came to the conclusion that she may have been under some stress when she took our order (because ya know, things go on in people's lives that we're not always aware of...or work issues etc.), but either way she flipped the script, and was very kind during our visit, offering a free sample of one of their soups, and checking in us throughout to see if we needed anything else. Oh and last but not least, the food is good. It was different than other Mediterranean places, but a very tasty gyro nonetheless. If you like Greek and you're in the area, you'd be wise to check this place out."}
{"text":"The gyro was amazing and the lentil soup was delicious! This is a friendly, family owned place that obviously cares about their food and their customers. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I was in town for several weeks on business and have already been here four times each time bringing more coworkers. I don't even pick my own order anymore and leave that up to the owners recommendation. Everything has been delicious!  Definitely a win for me, only con is they don't accept the corporate American express card so some coworkers shy away."}
{"text":"Awesome food and very good staff. The food is value for money. They have  amazing homemade baklava."}
{"text":"This is good food. I tried the potato curry soup and it was excellent. My entree of chicken and beef with rice was good. The most remarkable thing was the guy who took our order. He was super nice and helpful"}
{"text":"Good Fellas Good Food Good Service And Great Price I recommend Good Fellas To All Of My Friends And Family ."}
{"text":"Mediterranean was more like homely cooked ,flavours were right ,meat was cooked perfectly and soft . The rice was simply awesome and rightly portioned and cooked too.  The salad was dressed good and the pita was fresh out of the oven."}
{"text":"We eat here about twice a month and the food is delicious every time. The owner is very friendly and accommodating. Once while we were waiting for our to go order, he offered us some of his lentil and potato soup. They were to die for! This place offers the best tzatziki sauce I have ever tasted. The only thing I could wish for is that they offered souvlaki too. We will definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a $2.99 gyro. Excellent food for the money. Friendly staff.  The lentil soup is amazing to be sure!  I've seen this place on my way home from work several times and really am not sure why I haven't stopped in before but am glad I did and will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"You must try Good Fellas! Best Mediterranean food! Try the lunch special so you can try 3 different meats. The chicken kabob is my fave. Free amazing soup if you eat there. Yum"}
{"text":"This place is fantasic! I tried the 3 meat combo lunch special and was amazed! The chicken was my favorite. I believe the owner was the one at the register. She offered us each a free soup since it takes a little while to get your food. Even with that said, the wait was not long at all! Also tried their hummus, DELICIOUS!!! Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This is a little gem. First visit, Ninos helped up with ordering and also offered some of their delicious soup (lentil and potato/chicken)...both were amazing as was their hummus!!! This is the best hummus around. The rest of the menu is fabulous. The service is always stellar and the place is spotlessly clean. You could not find a better Greek establishment anywhere in Phx.   While the shopping center is a bit rundown looking, Good Fella's is a shining star."}
{"text":"The $2 euros are the best part about that place! And the lentil soup is like heaven! I will keep going back and i highly recommend going over there! The people that work there are so nice and so helpful! They really take pride with the food they cook and it really shows!"}
{"text":"Neighborhood gem serving Mediterranean-Greek foods. Today I had the famous lentil soup and the Kafta plate which included two skewers of seasoned ground beef, white rice, pita bread. The flavors of the skewers indeed did have the charcoal crisp authentic flavor! The white rice was soft and the way it was mixed with white onions gave it tremendous tastes! Yes I will be back again to try out the hummus and more lentil soup !"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying i passed 5 Mediterranean restaurants in order to try this place solely because of positive Yelp reviews and photos.  General Overview: I ordered pick up online from Good Fellas Grill website which his handled by Eatstreet. I ordered the beef skewers and veggie platter which said my order should have came with 2 skewers of steak and both baba ghanoush and hummus however only received 1 skewer ,only hummus and poor customers service.  Customer Experience: When i entered the restaurant it was empty (already a bad sign i guess) and the women was on her phone, she did not acknowledge me and continued to walk around and talk until her conversation was over, about a minute but no more than two. After informing her i was here for pick up she attempted to charge me for my order again even though i paid with paypal when i placed the order online. She said \"They\" (Eatstreet) informed them that i had not paid and she asked me to pull up my bank account to show it was deducted. She also stated not to use Eatstreet , handed me a menu and told me to call next time i want to order since i asked them to replace the rice with salad on the order and it was not charged online.  When I got home i opened the food to find there was only one skewer in the box. When I called the store the women at the restaurant she acted as if she couldn't hear me at which point I was now a little irritated. After i re-explained again she spoke with her cook and came back to tell me its only supposed to come with 1 skewer ( 6 pieces) to which i asked her to update the website.  The Food: On top of the poor customers service the food was below expectation and not as advertised. The veggie platter came with two servings of hummus instead of both hummus and baba ghanoush. Mind you I am a foodie so i know they look similar and have some of the same flavor profiles.The hummus had no drizzle of olive oil on top and the salad was just dressed in red wine vinegar ,(Wheres the Greek dressing?).I will give my honest opinion and say however the steak was tender and flavorful and the garlic yogurt was an unexpected tasty addition. The potato cake was slightly soggy but had good flavor. The Boorack was crispy however I did not care for the filling because it had a thick mushy texture however it was seasoned well.   Final Thoughts: The negatives far outweighed the positives, at least with my personal experience, so I don't think I will return to either the Eatstreet site or this restaurant."}
{"text":"Goodfellas is great food it seems as if it's homemade and not restaurant made which to me is a great thing My wife and I dine there quite often"}
{"text":"Outstanding place, delicious food, great hospitality!! I was in a group of three and we ordered Ground Beef Kabab, Gyro Plate, Hummus, and soups. The lentil soup was delicious. The kabobs (chicken and beef) were very juicy and the pita bread and hummus were good too. I am surely going to visit this place again!"}
{"text":"Reading the reviews i had to try this place.   Although everyone talks about free soup and we did not get free soup.   I do not like their tzaziki sauce at all it's very thick and chunky with chunks of cucumber.   I like it creamy with lots of dill.  But the gyros were good, service was ok.  Definately not as great as what the reviews say but maybe we had someone else.    Probably won't be back we like King Gyros and Chicago Gyros the most but I'm glad we finally tried it."}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent, excellent.  The food is fantastic, but as others have said, the superb customer service is the highlight. The owner is seemingly always in a good mood, always welcoming, and always willing to have a pleasant little chat."}
{"text":"Please, oh please, give Good Fellas a try!  It should almost have a star above it, because the food is heavenly!  We haven't introduced anyone to Good Fellas that hasn't been thankful for \"finding\" it!  The RICE!  Heavens!  This is GOOD!"}
{"text":"My wife, who loves lentil soup, says this is the best shes ever had.  Even though we arrived right at closing time, the staff was friendly and didn't rush us out"}
{"text":"This place is great. We had the chicken and potato soup (on the house because ninos the owner is one of the nicest guys around), babaganouj, and three meat combo plate. Everything we had was tasty, homemade and fresh. The meats were seasoned well, the rice was great, the pita was hot and we were very very pleased with our dinner.   Thanks Ninos!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for $2.99 gyros had good lento soup and great staff!! I'll be back every week from now on"}
{"text":"OMG can we say great food!!! So glad we paid attention to reviews and gave it a try:-) Give this place a try you wont be disappointed. The place was so good my boyfriend said \"this tastes better than my moms food\" and btw her food is delicious! That says it all."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place based on all the reviews. No idea why my experience so disappointing. Two orders of fries were both very soggy, cold, and undercooked. Asked for NO salt on fries so of course both were loaded with salt. Falafel sandwich was odd...it appeared to be one long big slab of falafel vs falafel balls which is the norm. Falafel very hard, cold, and tasteless. It appeared to be old and not freshly cooked. Sandwich so loaded with cucumber that it was inedible."}
{"text":"Great place and amazing food. Went there for Mother's Day dinner for first time. I ordered multiple appetizers and dishes to try them all. Nothing was wasted they were all very tasty. I left stuffed and very pleased with this place.  I just wished it looked nicer inside the restaurant. Decorations, furniture etc. but it still didn't ruin the experience bc food was really what stood out here of course."}
{"text":"Tasty, delicious greek and Mediterranean food. I'm a huge fan of the gyros. The chicken is excellent as well. Free soup while you wait is a nice compliment. Staff is friendly and polite as well, and the place is rather clean considering the location."}
{"text":"One word:  WOW. Passing through Phoenix and our family decided to stop here because of its Yelp ratings. I can see why this place is popular. Unbelievably good Greek cuisine with a homecooked family flair.  I only wish we had one of these places in my hometown in Oregon.  HIGHLY recommended."}
{"text":"The food is just amazing and the service too. I usually eat the grilled fish or the chicken kabab and they taste just amazing. I love the guy who serves here, always does an amazing job. Can take a little time for them to deliver the food but it's because it's served so fresh and they are all so courteous."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the owners make sure you are satisfied! I highly suggest the kabob chicken- yum!"}
{"text":"I kind of can't believe how quiet this place is in comparison to Chino. I'm not a big fan of Chino- don't get the hype at all, but especially when this place is RIGHT NEXT DOOR.  Solid spot: love me some chicken kabob!"}
{"text":"Wow!   I have been a Chino's fan for almost 7 years now and never knew of this place. I found it on Yelp and decided to go and man am I glad I did.  I got the three meat combo and a bowl of the potato soup. Everything was amazing. I would even come back just for the potato soup.  Location: Location sucks, but I am used to it because of Chino's.   Ambiance: Cute. Recently remodeled and it had two flat screen TVs to watch. VERY quiet despite there being two large family members.  Service: I had Nino take my order at the counter, he explained everything and even offered to customize the meals. He also followed up with every table in the room. More places should have service like this.  Food: Amazing. I would pick this place over Chino's any day of the week, now that I know about it. The food was well priced and had great flavor. I ended up eating all of my chicken and steak, but was too full to eat the beef, though I tried.  Complaints: Is too much food a complaint? If so, then my only complaint is too much food. I felt bad leaving that much food on my plate, but there was no way I could eat it all.  Overall, I would come back. The soup alone is worth coming back for. Next time I am just getting the steak and chicken so I don't waste too much food."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. I ordered the three meats plate with salad instead of rice. The flavor was great! I also ordered the hummus and while it was presented nicely I wasn't impressed. But then I am not big on hummus. It was bland to me. Refried beans have more taste. The service was excellent, place clean and staff friendly. They deliver within a certain radius so I could definitely see ordering in from my office if I were there."}
{"text":"Very good Greek restaurant. Gives me that Big Fat Greek Wedding feel. Their cucumber sauce is homemade and very fresh some of the best sauce I've ever tasted. My wife had the gyro and the meat is seasoned perfectly. It doesn't taste like restaurant food, it taste very homemade which is something I've never experienced with Greek food. I had the kebab Hindy which is very good. The seasoning they use for this dish is amazing and I know any time people go to a Greek place they want a gyro but they should give this dish a try."}
{"text":"I was up on this side of the valley, so I thought I would find some food. This place came up as the highest rated restaurant that was open with 5 miles, so I thought why not?   Located in a strip mall, it wasn't much to see from the outside. Once you went in, it looked like your run of the mill restaurant. Clean, but nothing really interesting to see.   I came in a little before lunch, so it took them a minute to come out from the back. I had a minute to browse their menu. Pretty normal Mediterranean selection.   Started off with the soup. I had the choice of lentil or chicken and potato, and I made the mistake of going with the latter. Chicken was tasty, and not fatty, but the broth was just a simple chicken broth. 3/5  As for the entree, I got the 7, 2 meat combo. Portion size was good. Onions on one side and tomatoes on the other. Lots of rice which filled me right up.  As for the meat, the chicken was juicy and delicious. The ground beef had just enough spice and was also quite tasty.   Overall, if you live or work around here I would recommend coming here. Not worth the travel outside the area though."}
{"text":"We ate dinner at Good Fellas tonight for the first time, following fellow Yelper's advice.  It was really really good!  I had the chicken sandwich dish and boyfriend had the gyro plate.  We had the hummus appetizer and the waitress gave us two free soups while we waited:  one lentil and one chicken/potato.  Everything was very flavorful.  I was wishing I had more stomach space.  Yes, it's in a strip mall in a sketchy area, but the food is worth it.  The TV was on so it felt like sitting at home.  It was a lot of food at very reasonable prices.  Many customers came in for togo orders.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Three of us came to this Greek restaurant for dinner after seeing all the great reviews on Yelp.  The interior was parsimonious with tiled floors, all around white walls, and tables that spread across the floor. As a first time visitor, the order first, and seat yourself protocol was easy to figure out. I was anticipating an extended Greek menu, but the range of choices was limited to a few kabobs, gyros, soups and salads.  We started off with a bowl of complimentary Lentil Soup. The soup was semi-thick, smooth, with a full-bodied lentil texture, and a subtle kick at the finisher. It was an outstanding soup, and I was already half way full prior to our appetizer.   The Hummus ($4.99) was plentiful and served with warm pita. With garlic flavor in the backdrop, the texture was assisted by olive oil drizzles and easy to pick up with the basket of pita.   The Chicken Kabob ($7.99) was served with two skewers of chicken and large portion of rice. The chicken was moist but a bit saltier than expected. The rice was flavorful, but also noticeably greasy. It was an experience of quantity over quality.   Service was friendly, warm, attentive, and outstanding. We were pleasantly surprised by the free homemade Baklava at the end. With many restaurants that serve Kabobs and other conventional dishes in the area, I thought they could have distinguished themselves with a more traditional home-style menu filled with hard to find options. I don't think I will be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"I am an avid yelp viewer, but not until going to good fellas did I feel compelled to make an account just to comment on this place. Keeping it simple: awesome food, the staff is amazing, great prices too.  Everyone MUST try this place."}
{"text":"The lentil soup alone is to trade my kids for (not my grandson tho').....ok just got the Gyro plate....food is amazing!!!.....I will be a regular!!!!!!!!!.....once again the LENTIL SOUP IS HYPNOTIZING!!!"}
{"text":"Right around the corner from work, this spot is super convenient to stop in for lunch! They give you a free cup of soup with every order (the lentil soup is delicious) and have fast service! I believe it is family owned and operated, and the service is always good! I usually get the Veggie Platter, but I've tried nearly everything on the menu and I have never been disappointed! I would highly recommend the soups, Baklava, Chicken Lettuce Wraps, and Veggie Platter!"}
{"text":"Wraps were terrific, as was the two meat plate and the soups were outstanding! AND the service was friendly, not obnoxiously so, just genuinely friendly."}
{"text":"After a Thanksgiving of savoring the delicious life, with home brined/ baked turkey, honey ham and all the fixings, I had to get something else on black friday while on vacation. So I popped open Yelp and narrowed down my search to four Mediterranean places north of downtown Phoenix.  I randomly picked Good Fellas Grill off N. 19th Ave. and W. Greenway Rd. without regret. Service was awesome. Portions, especially for the very well priced lunch specials were adequate and filling. The chicken and meats on the kabob dishes were moist and tender, with the moist rice balancing out the spices and seasonings. The gyro was delicious, as well as the lentil and potato chicken curry soups that came with. Why bother having full sized portions when the junior portions suffice?  Price vs. performance as well as service was exceptional. Now only if I could find a good combination of such in the S.F. Bay Area... I'm gonna miss the good fellas at Good Fellas. It's a newcomer to the area (seven months) but it definitely does not disappoint, especially for travelers on a budget, looking for a delicious place. A place I'd go back to, the next time I seek nice winter weather in the Valley of the Sun, as opposed to the dreary S.F. fog."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and picked up the three meat lunch special with rice, salad and complimentary soup. The meats were really good, juicy with plenty of flavor. I especially liked the kabob chicken. The rice and pea soup were good but nothing special. That salad was extraordinary! They have a small selection of bottled drinks or you can get soda off a soda machine they have. Went to the restroom and it seamed like the faucet was gonna fall off and the staff was ok. Besides that pretty good place. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"My friend and I come here often and it has been consistently delicious! The staff is extremely friendly and the portion sizes are perfect. Food comes out quickly, and is always fresh.   We usually get our orders to-go, but recently found out that if you dine in you get a complimentary soup. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"I don't have much Greek food experience but this place has definitely encouraged me to to have try it more often.  The place seems to be family/friends owned and run, which makes the services more personable and friendly, which is always a good thing. I've been here a few times and the best thing I've had so far is the 2 meat combo. Seasoned to be strong but not overpowering and when mixed with the rice and pita bread makes for a very delicious lunch. And you get complimentary soup too!  The restaurant itself is rather plain, no crazy shit on the walls or anything but that's OK. The food is cook when you order it but it comes out fast enough that its not a hassle so I would just take it to go.   In summary, I will definitely be back and when I have visitors for out of town, this and Chino Bandido next door makes for a one two punch of delicious ness!"}
{"text":":/  Loved Good Fellas the first time we went, as you can tell by my glowing review. But we had quite a few hiccups last time we were there.   Let's start with the ordering. And a disclaimer. Ninos was no where to be seen- which may have something to do with our experience. It took about 5 minutes for the man behind the counter to do whatever he was doing with the cash register before he could take our order. I ordered the vegetarian plate but they said they were out of the boorak. I said that's fine but could I please substitute falafel for the boorak on the plate. They said that's okay... We tried to pay with our credit card but they couldn't seem to work the machine. Which is the same thing that happened with the last customer. I had a groupon to redeem on my phone. He clicked the redeem button on my groupon BEFORE he got the voucher number. (Facepalm) Luckily he still took the groupon value off our order.   We get our drinks, and sit down to the bowls of steaming house soup. (Still delicious!) I take a sip of my iced green tea. It tastes like yucky water. I go dump it out and get black tea from their iced tea machine. Also looks and tastes like water. I should have told them, but I was exhausted and weak with hunger. So I get Sprite and return to our table.  Our food comes. I am handed a big plate of falafel. (Big sigh) I wave them down and remind them I ordered the vegetarian plate substituting the boorak for falafel. After much confusion and discussion between the two men running the place, he says he will bring me the rest of the vegetarian plate and we can keep the big plate of falafel. Redeemed. Then my vegetarian plate comes out. Just baba ghanoush and hummus. I give him a blank stare. He says \"this is the vegetarian plate\" with a big smile. I seem to recall the vegetarian plate also had a potato cake which I adored and also was looking forward to. But I was tired, so tired of the back and forth. So I ate the food, which was still delicious and plentiful. My husband loved this gyro sandwich as well.  Bottom line- the food is still incredible but I am very disappointed with the service that particular night. I hope it doesn't happen again or we won't return. I am exhausted just from writing this review..."}
{"text":"We come here all the time during lunch break. Absolutely love the place. Good people running the restaurant. Fast, delicious, and quiet."}
{"text":"Got the 2 meat combo. Good chicken and beef. Will have to try the burgers next time. They looked good."}
{"text":"Good Fellas has great service! Their food is outstanding! My favorite items here are their pitas, hummus, gyros, and burgers. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Well I was headed to get some grub in Phoenix when BAM!!!... Two idiot drivers came together to form a Toyorolet sculpture right in front of me as I came to a stop at a light.This little work of art caused a traffic deadlock but low and behold there was a gyro serving restaurant in a strip mall right next to my only line of escape. LUCKY ME! This place was great and the family of proprietors are amazing.  I ordered a Gyro Plate with the whole nine. They offered me some complimentary soup while I waited and I chose lentil. Amazing soup. I can't quite remember what prompted me but something I noticed about the place made me wonder if these folks where fellow Chicagoans and sure enough... The cook/son was a Bears fan... My food was ready but I stuck around for a few more minutes to chat and will definitely stop by Good Fellas for a Gyro whenever I am in town. Also a few other things I was told to try!"}
{"text":"The best Mediterranean food I have ever had. Super fresh, tasty, and not greasy at all. Super friendly staff. Definitely will return"}
{"text":"Are you fucking kidding me?  Can I say fucking in a review?  This place is absolutely incredible, like some kind of mirage in the desert--so good I think it won't be there when I return, or else I'm going to go back and it will be an Italian restaurant like I thought it was the first time.  I saw the reviews before eating there, but I nearly turned around when I looked at the storefront.  My god, what a mistake that would have been.    I ordered every vegetarian item on the menu, like the vegetarian glutton that I am, and as a gift she brought me a bowl of lentil soup, which I consumed so quickly and with so much gusto that she brought me another.  Hummous: fantastic.  Falafel: like I just walked out of a shop in Morocco.  It's crazy good.  On top of that, they are lovely people.  I just moved to Phoenix, but I'll definitely be eating here weekly when we get back from London."}
{"text":"This place is ok but not the best. Purchased a gyro platter and again...it was ok. Wasn't to thrilled that the sauce was already spread all over the gyro and rice. I prefer to have the sauce on the side. I felt like the rice was prepared early in the day and not freshly made. The gyro itself was ok but not a lot of flavor.   Good customer service and very friendly! I guess I'll give it another shot and order something else on the menu."}
{"text":"On our way from Sky Harbor to Sedona and needed a lunch break. Yelped and came across the highly rated GFG. Found it in a storefront side-strip of shops (\"Good Fellas Grill\" is a small part of the bigger sign, so be on the lookout). Could not believe how sweet the owner was or how great the food tasted.   No atmosphere, but awesome Middle Eastern food. Excellent lentil soup. Superb hummus that's gotta a great little kick, and baba ganoush with a wonderful smokey taste. We all shared, and they were the perfect precursors to some of the best chicken, gyros, and ground beef kabobs I can ever remember tasting.  Dollar for dollar, this place is an amazing find. I'm bummed that it's about a 1,000 miles away from where I usually have to eat lunch, but now that I know where it is, I'm going to add it to my short list of favorite area restaurants so I always know where to get some great food when out your way!"}
{"text":"A great find! Family owned hole in the wall with best Mediterranean in Phoenix. Large portions, great prices. And yes, free tasty soup!"}
{"text":"Great whipped garlic dip with bread. Rice has a different, good flavor. Tasty marinated chicken."}
{"text":"i love this food. the gyro is awesome and the rice is absolutely delicious.  if you are waiting for an order you get some complimentary soup, which my husband just loves.  i will be eating there again.  great food."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent, friendly service. The owner was awesome. The chicken is soooooooooo yummy! No complaints at all on anything."}
{"text":"Great food and easy to order. I eat a lot of Greek food. This was authentic and tasty. Eat here. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great quality food, great service and great value. Been going there since it opened and it's always been consistent. Gotta check it out if you haven't."}
{"text":"Yelp helps find another out of the way spot.  This place is in a small nondescript strip mall and I never would have found it.  We had the lettuce wrap and the gyro plate.  Both were great and large portions. We got our orders to go and while we were waiting, the man taking orders (possibly the owner?) brought out two complimentary bowls of soup!  Not sure of what the names of the soups.  One was a potato type and I think the other was possibly a lentil curry?  Both were excellent and I'm not a big soup fan. Good food, great service, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"My coworker and I we wanted to taste something new so I decided to see what was in the area at work, and so we decided to try this place they have good food it's nice to appreciate a mom and pop shop it takes pride in the quality of food that they serve including their customer service we shall go back next time even with a bigger order."}
{"text":"Decided to go for some Greek and Mediterranean food tonight and kind of threw a dart at the board and it landed on Good Fellas Grill. I generally haven't had a great experience with Greek food but boy was that changed during this visit. Walked in, only about 3 people there, presentation of the restaurant was pretty nice. Had that typical look you'd expect from a place like this, very comfortable eating environment.   Had no idea what to order so I went with some lettuce wraps and the owner Ninos threw in some lentil and potato soup. Awesome! Food came out within 2 minutes. Perfect! Potato soup was great. Lettuce wraps were amazing. Honestly, I was shocked on what I've been missing. I almost want to travel back for seconds now. Ninos suggested another selection and I'm motivated to come back and check it out!  This is how you run a business right here. The customer service was flawless and honestly so was the food. For the price it's worth it. I wish I could give a better rating, so I will 6 stars! Sorry Yelp! I'm breaking the rules on this one."}
{"text":"This is by far one the of best local eateries I have been to. The service and food are always top notch and the place is always clean."}
{"text":"Fantastic Food.  I had the gyro plate which had some great flavor.  The rice was awesome as well.  My girlfriend had the steak and chicken meat plate which she loved.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Lots of great healthy food prepared the way you want it! Excellent staff, clean dining area, not expensive, just good plentiful food with a family welcome atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I was really surprised how nice this place was inside.   The strip mall it's in doesn't give it justice. There are several TVs, nice furniture, & just super clean. The service was incredible too from the time I arrived to the time I left I was asked how things were & they even have a card to punch or scratcher with a chance to win money.  I came here on a recommendation to try their gyro & it was pretty darn good. The pita it came in was fresh & plenty of meat. Only thing I thought was just ok was the sauce, it was a little runny for my taste but still good. Now since my scratcher was 50% off my next visit I will have to come back."}
{"text":"I continue to be wowed by Good Fellas!!!  Ninos and his family are the nicest restaurant owners I have met in a very long time!  I am now a regular and visit about 1-2 times per week. Trust me on this one, the food, service, and cleanliness of this place is flawless.  I needed to write another review because this place is that good and I want it to succeed! Nuf said, eat at Good Fellas, and no, I am not related nor have any affiliation, just pure admiration for a job well done."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food.  The lentil soup is the best I have had.  And combo #7 with chicken...lamb..bazmati rice was superb."}
{"text":"Always amazing!! Food is delicious, service is friendly!! We love Good Fellas and will always be back!!"}
{"text":"Found this place on accident.  As many other Yelpers.. Neno, hooked us up with free samples, soup and made sure we were happy.. he knows word of mouth is the best advertising!  we ordered the Flafel salad, chicken sandwich, and i ordered the Gyro dinner with rice.  The food was fantastic! the soups were delicious. the price was perfect! portions were out of control!   If you go, you will be back, i know I have!"}
{"text":"This Mom and Pop restaurant serves really good Mediterranean Cruise. Their lentil soup is superb! Just love Goodfellow's Gyros! They have generous portions. The food is delicious!"}
{"text":"First time today, fabulous food! I ordered the 3 meat combo. The seasonings are amazing and love the whipped garlic dip. Looking forward to trying more things on the menu."}
{"text":"By far one of the best middle eastern restaurants in town! It reminds me of my family's home cooking!  Hummus-amazing! Potato soup-I could drink it! Veggie plate is so savory and fulfilling, and baklava melts in your mouth!   Assyrian food!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for takeout! They always offer us free soup while we wait. Amazing staff. Food is delicious and fairly priced. Love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch...the location is ok but the food is very good.  The owner was extremely nice and friendly.  Everything was good...the lunch special for $6.99 is perfect: salad, rice, 3 different kinds of meat and bread.  The 4 of us each had soup (the lentil and the potato w/chicken) then shared the special, Gyros sandwich and the beef sandwich.  It was weird at first to order a Chicago beef sandwich from a Greek place, but it was excellent.  The owner is  from Chicago and it was exactly done the way my husband likes it (we are also from Chicago so we know a good beef sandwich).  A jem of a place!"}
{"text":"Wow! Lentil soup was amazing potato chicken soup was stellar. Real Gyro Meat! Can't wait to come back and my kiddo's loved  it to.I love  a family local restaurant."}
{"text":"Found Good Fellas by searching for \"lentil soup in Phoenix\". So I stopped by to try it, ordered the gyro sandwich and falafel plate. We loved all of it and will be back soon. As for customer service, it was excellent. They made me feel like they were glad I was there and even offered me a complimentary bowl of potato soup which was excellent!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with Daren and Ryan here last week and was treated like I was part of the family by the owner.  I had the 3 meat lunch cuz I could not decide what to get.  Everything was cooked perfect and look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Came in during lunch and it was amazing! Great customer service, delicious food, reasonably priced..you can't go wrong. We ordered the lunch 3 meat special, gyro, spanakopita, and kids chicken tenders. Also had lentil and potato soup (on the house). We loved every bit!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, free soup on the house, delicious fresh food, plenty vegetarian options, clean place, spacious seating, great prices and fast service- these are the reasons I love this place and keep coming back.   Unfortunately, I never bothered looking at their vegetarian options and always kept ordering the falafel sandwich until somebody mentioned their menu on the right wall is all vegetarian. They have some good options, try the stuffed mushrooms or potato cakes. Both are delicious but my personal fav is the mushrooms, it's called boorak.   If you're getting take out, they still offer soup while you're waiting."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since their opening day 3 years ago. We usually order take out but when we feel like an extra treat, we dine in for the full experience. Ninos (the owner) is always in such a great mood, friendly and welcoming - you can tell he takes pride in his food and customer service.  My husband always orders the gyro pita with fries, but tonight he ordered it will the Greek salad. Delicious as usual. We had some hummus and pita, and it such a large amount for the price - I have plenty leftover for lunch tomorrow.  I ordered the 2 meat combo (served with rice, tomatoes and onions), and while the chicken was tender and flavorful as usual, the Kafta (seasoned ground beef) really  knocked it out of the park. So tender, and seasoned wonderfully. I will definitely get that again. The rice is consistently cooked well - fluffy and light, and so flavorful.  The best part of the dining in experience, is that Ninos usually let's us sample his daily soups. Tonight, there were 2 soups - Lentil soup, and Potato soup.  They each had such unique flavor, absolutely delicious.  The potato soup had a nice kick to it on the back end.   I love supporting local businesses, and this is one of my favorites. So happy to have Good Fellas Grill in my neighborhood. Do yourself a favor and experience this awesome food. Super family-friendly, great value, and fresh, flavorful food. We love it!"}
{"text":"Potato soup was amazing, Owner is so friendly great service and fresh food. It's like homemade cocking strate from"}
{"text":"So I live in Scottsdale but I was out in these here parts for work and it happened to be lunch time, so checking my hand dany yelp revealed to me this little hidden gem. I am middle eastern and was raised by a mother who cooked three delicious, lavish meals every single day for us kids so I am very very picky when it comes to middle eastern cuisine, and I am happy to announce this place blew me away. I went with the 2 meat combo (#7) and oh man. The Lentil soup was delicious and insanely flavorful. The kebab meat? perfectly seasoned and tender, most places over tenderize which leads to stringy meat and chemical taste, but not here. The chicken kebab? My entire life, the thousands and thousands of chicken kebab I have enjoyed, this place was the second best (sorry guys, my pops still makes it the best, but I am biased) Excellently grilled and seasoned. The rice was delicious and reminiscent of persian rice with a raw egg stirred in. I wish I lived closer, but I will definitely be back. I can see why this place is ranked top 10 of all restaurants in the valley. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"This is amazing Mediterranean food! Lunch specials are great - 3 meat platter with rice and salad for 6.99. Complimentary soup comes with all meals. Gyro sandwich is best I have had - the sauce that comes on it is great - tiziki base with cucumbers and tomatoes. Also can't beat the prices!!"}
{"text":"2nd time coming here and I love it! Great food, great service, and clean! First time I enjoyed the 3 meal combo special. 2nd time we did Family style plate for 4 people. I just loved the flavors and how fresh it tasted. Hummus is a must...they make it right! The lentil soup is perfect...especially now that's fall season. Salad is so fresh! Portion is more than enough and so worth it. Give it a try and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon, and it was amazing. Ordered hummus plate to start, hot pitas, olive oil drizzle, and huge. But....before that came they serve you soup, go with the curry lentil...amaze balls, it's pureed and more brothy than thick, awesome flavor, chicken vegetable soup my buddy liked more, but that's because he doesn't like lentils. I ordered the 3 meat kabobs and it's a ton of food! All three were amazing and on point, not a fan of chicken breast but theirs was fork tender and extremely well seasoned, the filet was the highlight, cumin salt pepper rub that had a nice crust and meat was still medium, just bomb dot com!! Friend ordered the gyro and it was also massive, couldn't even finish it, and the tziki sauce with small chunks of cucumber was of the chain. Too bad this place is so far north! I would be here weekly! Highly recommend, funky name, great food!"}
{"text":"So we came here because the reviews were good. DO NOT let this place fool you. At first i thought, this place isnt going to be that good. OH MY GOSH, BEST GREEK PLACE EVER. I left more than full.   3 meat combo - juicy, flavorfull and amazing. 5/5  Gyro plate - Flavorfull, sauce was ohk,  but would get it again! 4/5   Bakalava- AWESOME AND RICH. 5/5  Potato soup- Rich flavor and awesome just as everyone says. 5/5  Lentil- Soup didnt have as much flavor as the potato soup but still good and a bit zesty. 4/5  We will be back, hole in the wall gem. Cant wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Great, fast, fresh and delicious.  We're from the Northwest where there is a lot of great Mediterranean food.  We were driving down from Prescott to Phoenix and we're really craving some Kabab action.  Super thrilled to have found this little gem.  Right off I-17.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great local place if you enjoy Mediterranean food. The soups are excellent and the meals overall are good. All the various meats are nicely seasoned and well cooked, the pita is fresh and good. Salads are crisp and fresh. Staff are friendly and helpful. A great place to snag a lunchtime bite."}
{"text":"Meat trio lunch special...any time I'm in the area, i will be coming here to eat. Kefta, Gyro, and chicken schwarma were all juicy and absolutely delicious. Good portions too!  Flavors are amazing. Great job Good Fellas!"}
{"text":"Wow! Didn't expect that. Place looked empty for a Saturday night. But walked in & the young lady behind the counter was as sweet as can be. They even gave up soup for starters on the house. We ordered lettuce wrsps and they were good. Next time i may order them as a light meal alternative. Had the 2 meat combo plate beef & chicken, moist, well seasoned. Rice was perfect. Hubby ordered the gyro sandwich with fries & his meat was cooked perfectly too. Food was fresh and warm. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I went here specifically to try the falafel and I was not disappointed. The Falafel had good texture and flavor and was not dry at all (which I have had many other places where the falafel is soo dry or fried too much), and really didn't need the tahini sauce that came with it. The tahini had a strong vinegar flavor (I think they used red wine vinegar in the sauce) which was ok. I was not a fan of the dressing on the salad; not sure if it was the dressing or the herbs.   Family running the place was really nice and the sample of chicken and potatoe curry soup was really good. And sample was not a small cup but a full bowl; that was very surprising.  Even though I was not thrilled with the tahini or dressing on the salad I would go back just for the great falafel. Plus I want to try the hummus and some of thier meat dishes."}
{"text":"Their Kefta Kabob is delicious!   I had the three meat dinner and my friends had the chicken skewers.  All of us enjoyed the meat and the rice that was included in the dinner entree.    The dinner included soup. I had the vegetable and my friends had the lentil  soup. Both soups tasted homemade.  We shared a generous hummus appetizer with fresh pita bread that was outstanding.    It is more of a self serve and take out restaurant. You place your order at the counter and they deliver it to the table.   The prices for the larger dinners are around $13. The only thing I would improve on is putting a little more meat on the skewers.   I plan on being back."}
{"text":"We actually ended up eating here because Chino Bandido was closed. Although we were bummed that we were unable to try Chino Bandido, we were so happy that this place offered amazing food at a cheap price. We came here for lunch and they offered a lunch special. $6.99 for a 3 meal plate with rice and salad + pita. Check in on Yelp and you get 20% off so that's about $6.  The rice was really fluffy and flavorful. The meats were oh so amazing and moist. The pita and the garlic sauce we BOMB. Seriously, all that for $6?! And a FREE soup?! What a steal."}
{"text":"This restaurant is nothing to look at but the food was tasty, the prices were reasonable and the service was pleasant."}
{"text":"The chicken is always amazing, wish I knew how they did it. The manager always offers free soup while we wait. Our order was taking longer than usual, they offered us free baklava while we waited. This owner deserves your business."}
{"text":"What a GREAT meal!  The food is fantastic - we got the potato soup, lentil soup, French Fries, the 2 meat combo, 3 meat combo and baklava - absolutely everything was fresh, delicious and satisfying!  The portion sizes were great, and the prices were so reasonable for the amount of food you get!! Also, the atmosphere was just so pleasant, and the owner, Nino, even took time to come over to ask how everything was. Fantastic little place that has just jumped to the top of our favorite Greek/Med. food places!"}
{"text":"I stoped in on a rainy day and tried their 3 meat lunch special which consisted of basmati rice, greek salad, chicken kabob, kufteh kabob and gyro meat. A lot of food great price and sooooooo tasty. While I waited for a few minutes for the food to be cooked the lady offered me a bowl of hot soup on the house. It was one of the best lentil soup bowls I have ever had! It was absolutely delish! Hubs tried their babaganuj and fell in love. This place is down the street from our new house and we love it. The people who run it are really nice too."}
{"text":"This place was spectacular. the lunch special came with soup and a drink. I was in love with the gyro. You can have it on a plate or in a pita.   I love trying new food and this place did not disappoint.   The guy working the register gave us the remote control and we sat there for a good 45 mins watching sports and local news. I just loved this whole experience."}
{"text":"Not impressed. I always order the same thing when trying a Greek restaurant for the first time. Gyro platter and Dolmas. This place is not memorable. The gyro meat is fine, not over the top. The dressing on the Greek side salad is underwhelming. The tzatziki has no texture and could easily be visually confused for ranch dressing. This alone is a sin in my culinary book. Moving on to the Dolmas, they were mushy, s bit slimy (not in an olive oil way), they looked like they came straight out of a can. This place was a one off for me, I have no intention of returning. If you want good gyro, go to George's. It's worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Incredible food. On of the best Mediterranean/Greek meals of my life. It's in a strip mall and the decor is average at best but the food is awesome."}
{"text":"The 10 am open time is a lie. It's also listed on the door sign as open at 10 am. Will not eat a a place too lazy to update the hours and I'm not waiting an hour for any food. Funny thing is seeing several people inside sitting around waiting for 11 am. It's 1015."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good food,  reasonable prices,  and they gave me a free soup.   What more do you monsters want?   FREE SOUP!"}
{"text":"Yep this place is excellent, flavor is out of the park good. Some of the best Mediterranean food in the valley. Restaurant is clean workers are friendly and dining in you get a bowl of delicious potato soup makes me drool just thinking about that soup. It's all good food here and the quality has stayed the same. You want flavor give this little gem a try I wager you will like it."}
{"text":"This place is great. Food was awesome, with plenty of spices and herbs in everything!   Athena wasn't sure she was going to have anything (She's not that fond of Greek food, despite her name. I think her anti-fondness stemss from some lame aversion to lamb...go figure).  So, the guy behind the counter taking the order suggested the #7 2-meat combo for her, which is expertly seasoned ground beef, and nicely marinated, big ol' chicken breast cubes. She ended up totally loving it, and taking some photos because it looked so nice. (I'll update those later on. )  I went with the #12 gyros plate, because I have no aversion to lamb whatsoever. In fact, I seek it out. I took some pix too, but I couldn't figure out how to operate her camphone very well - so not sure those will be upload worthy.  Drinks come in those red plastic glasses, which I've always loved for some reason. The fountain is Coca-Cola products - but I won't dock them for that, because there was at least Orange Fanta, and a high-tech kinda brewed tea thingy.  We got some soup samples \"on the house\". Lentil, and curried chicken/potato. Both totally awesome.   The place looked fabulous, and was getting better while we were there. They were busy painting an area where apparently a 42\"-ish TV had been hanging, so they could replace it with a spanking new 50\" LED model. That'll make 3 of those babies in this nicely appointed place. All were tuned to sports networks - so you should be able to catch a game while u eat!  Only drawback - no beer or wine. A nice carafe of a decent house red would really put this place over the top - as far as strip-mall gyro places go. I hope they add this option - and get ahold of one of the local brewers (Old World Brewery? SanTan?) to supply them with some #craftbeers, rather than opt for some draft crud from one of the big 3."}
{"text":"As I was in the neighborhood for some work meetings, I decided to pop in here for dinner.  Location & Aesthetics -- located just away from the corner of N 19th Ave and Greenway Road in a small strip mall area.    A bit difficult to miss based on the signage as the business sign doesn't pop out at you, but blends in with some of the other business signs. Lots of available parking out front.   Interior -- very spacious with lots of available comfortable seating, very clean tables and surroundings, and adequate lighting. Noise level was quiet even with the TV's on the walls as they were muted.  Service -- staff were warm and friendly, and welcomed us as we walked inside.  Service to the table was prompt and very courteous.  Menu -- very easy to comprehend as there were photos on the walls that displayed what some of the dishes were like.  Menus were provided as we approached the checkout.    Food -- very delicious!  Ordered the 2-meat plate -- rice, chicken, ground beef (I believe), tomatoes, and onions.  This came with a complimentary bowl of either chicken soup or lentil.  I went with the latter.  A basket of pita bread with tzatziki sauce is also brought to the table. The lentil soup was very hot, not scalding, and very tasty with some kick to it -- well seasoned.  The pita bread was also very hot, and the tzatziki sauce was also very tasty -- seemed like there was the correct amount of strained yogurt, cucumbers, garlic, olive oil, and salt.  It was too oily or too pasty and completed the pita bread just well enough. The 2-meat plate -- rice, ground beef (I believe) and chicken were all delicious.  My only gripe was I felt there should've been more meat on the plate -- more pieces of chicken and/or beef (-1).  The both meats were adequately seasoned and cooked/served at the right temperature. The rice wasn't too oily/greasy, and very well seasoned, and tasted freshly cooked/prepared.  If I am in the neighborhood again I will definitely visit again to try some of their other delicious looking plates!"}
{"text":"We love Good Fellas!! From the moment we walked in the employee. (I assume she is the owner) treated us like family! She was so sweet and even offered us a complimentary bowl of soup while we waited for our order!! Once it came it was gone in just a few seconds! We gobbled it up! The gyros we ordered were delicious and the meat was so moist and tender!! We will definitely be making this place one of our regulars!!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty bomb in flavor town plus the free potato soup was rad, got the 2 meat combo if your in the mood for rice it hits the spot"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about with this place. I had gyro for lunch. It was just kind of mediocre at best. No real flavor to the gyro meat, the diced tomatoes seemed a little old in taste and texture. The tzatziki sauce was chunky and lacked the flavor and texture of a quality Greek yogurt. Also the sandwich was barely warm and the pita was dry, stale and broke when folded. I don't know maybe I did not order the right thing. But if a simple gyro is not done right what hope is there for the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Low quality feel inside, Plaza eatery ambiance without much decor. I'll take both of those things in a heart beat if the food is good. They food was about average at best and costed a lot more than expected. Was very disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a place for really good Middle Eastern cuisine. Not fancy, but well cooked with good spicing and ample serving size. These folks from Syria are friendly and the service is efficient. The menu offers a good range, and the wary child can get a burger and fries. The ambiance is pleasant but informal; don't expect too much by way of decor."}
{"text":"I was excited when I saw Good Fellas Grill catering our staff meeting lunch last Friday. We had few trays of seasoned ground beef, marinated chicken, vegetarian dishes, and salad. Food was outstanding as always, so well prepared and delicious. I usually get the gyros and the meat platters when I dined in.  Their ground beef packed with enormous flavor. They sure loaded up on the rice in each tray.  We had plenty of leftovers to take home.  No cooking for a day or two = happy face! ;)"}
{"text":"So delicious! Very clean, nice atmosphere, plenty of nice tables to sit at, I didn't feel crowded at all. I like the menu, they have pictures of each of their dishes. The owner (I'm assuming he was the owner) was very friendly and helpful, you can tell he is really passionate about his food. I tried the potato curry soup and it was wonderful, just enough flavor, great consistency. I could tell it was homemade. The Gyro was fantastic as well, and even the french fries were perfect. It's nice to have some real Greek food instead of another hole in the wall Gyro place just looking to make a buck. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"A very family orientated  place ! With free soup potato soup or lentils.  The family runs the restaurant  are very nice, they bring the food out. A couple of flat screens which you can request to change. Prices are low and the food is excellent!!! I have been coming here since it opened never been disappointed.   I'm a 5 star 5 diamond chef. Love this place. For being hidden and no stars or diamond."}
{"text":"Solid 4 with room for more!   This place is only about a 5 minute drive from work, but if I am coming down this way, I am headed to Chino Bandido next door.  Today, I was headed to Chino Bandido, but I decided to veer left and check out Good Fellas.  They had an intriguing sign outside the door, too!  (3 meat lunch special for $5.99 between 11am-2pm).  I walked inside and went up to the counter.  It was probably about 2:08pm and I asked the dude at the counter if I could still get the lunch special.  He hooked me up at the $5.99 price (good man!)!  While sitting there, other people came in looking for the same thing, but he informed them that after 2pm, it went up to $7.99.  Still, as you will see, either price is a great deal!  I paid the man my money and was asked if I wanted a free bowl of soup while I waited.  I declined the soup, but it was a nice gesture, and if I was eating in, I would have taken him up on his offer.  Anyways....about 15 minutes later, my food was brought out to me and I was on my way back to the office to dig in.  Here is how it was..............  3 Meat Lunch Combo-  This plate comes with 3 meats, (chicken, kafta, and gyro) rice, a salad and 4 slices of pita bread along with some yogurt/hummus type dip. I dug into the kafta and rice first.  The kafta is basically a ground beef kebab.  It was seasoned well and very tasty!  I'm usually not the biggest fan of rice (unless its fried), but this rice was delicious!  It was the perfect texture, flavor and temperature!  I tried the gyro meat next.  It was topped with a cucumber/dill type sauce and was seasoned perfectly, also!  Last up was the chicken!  They only gave you 2 pieces of chicken, but those 2 pieces were fantastic!  The chicken had a nice char grilled taste while not being dried out.  I couldn't decide which one was my favorite.  All 3 of them were excellent.  The pita bread was great, too!  They give you 4 slices of pita bread and  a little cup of yogurt type dipping sauce.  Great flavors all around!  The only thing I didn't touch was the salad.  It was getting a bit wilted (drive back to work with hot items in the container...probably should have been separate from the hot items) and I tossed it out.  Everything else was fanfreakingtastic though!  Service was very friendly, and I appreciated the hookup of the lunch price even though it was a few minutes past the time frame.  The food did take a little while to come out, but it was definitely hot and fresh, so it was worth the wait.  I may call in a to go order next time though.  I'm sure I will be back in due time!  It was a great lunch!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Good Fellas Grill last night after reading all the reviews on Yelp.  I was not disappointed at all.  Ninos is a dynamic restaurant owner - offering everything you'd want in a local hole-in-the-wall restaurant.  He makes you feel instantly welcome with his warm smile and friendly disposition.  I kept thinking about who he reminded me of and it came to me this morning - the Cake Boss.  lol  While I waited for my meal to be prepared, he brought me some delicious potato chicken curry soup.  It was piping hot, wonderfully spicy, and the perfect way to begin the meal.  I ordered the hummus appetizer and the two-meat platter.  Everything was perfect.  The hummus was perfectly seasoned, creamy and rich with garlic.  The pita bread served with it was warm, fresh, and plentiful.  My two-meat platter was tasty, too.  The chicken was tender and juicy (which is difficult to do with chicken breast) and the seasoned ground beef kabab was also very good.  I also enjoyed the mountain of rice - which was basmati (or maybe jasmine).  It was fragrant, light, and fantastic.  I couldn't pass up on the little pistachio bird nest pastries by the register, so bought four of them to take home for later.  Like everything else, they were delicious - so buttery and bursting with yummy goodness.  My boyfriend is a vegetarian and I noticed they had nearly a dozen vegetarian selections including a veggie platter, falafel, hummus, lentil soup, and much, much more.  I can't wait to go back to try a different selection from their vast menu.  With most of their selections under $10 (some even at $7.99), it's affordable enough to make a regular stop."}
{"text":"Possibly one of the most spacious Mediterranean places I've ever been!! The decor is contemporary, it's clean and well kept. When you first walk in, it's confusing as to whether or not it's a sit down and order type of place. You don't though, you order at the counter and then sit. You get a bowl of complimentary soup in either lentil or chicken and rice. They bring your food to your table for you.   We both got the vegetarian platter, which I thought were amazing. Darrin thought that the falafel didn't have as much flavor as most other places we go, but I thought they were perfect!!! I also think most other places falafel is overly salty! You also get hummus, baba ghanouj, salad, and two other things that I can't remember what they were called... They were delicious though!!!   The staff were very polite and answered all of our questions for us as well as some suggestions if you don't know what you want.   We will definitely be back again!!"}
{"text":"Definitely Good Fellas here!  I came in 30 mins before closing to pick up my order via Yelp. It was rainy and dark outside so the restaurant was empty. They offered me a soup on the house, I got the potato and chicken. Potato nice and soggy (just the way I like it in soup!) and chicken was super tasty. I actually don't normally like chicken but this chicken was seasoned very well!  For appetizer I got hummus + pita bread. Yelp seemed to rave about their hummus. I thought it was OK. I wanted it to be a little more lemon-y. The bread was standard pita, nothing to really rave about.  For the meal I got the 3 meat plate that came with a beef kabob, grilled chicken skewer and a steak skewer. I really liked the chicken and steak. Chicken wasn't dry and well seasoned so that was a big plus! Steak is steak... It was flavored just enough that you can still taste that delicious beefiness of steak. Loved it! The beef kabob was a little disappointing. I didn't think the seasoning went too well with it, but with some of that garlic spread, it tasted alright. The rice was a little over cooked for me. A tad too soggy.  Ordered a Baklava on the spot as well. To my surprise it was a pistachio one! I super regretted not getting 2 additional pieces! It was delicious and they gave me my 1 piece on the house as well! I wished the top layers could've been a little more crunchy rather than soggy (from all the honey) but this was the highlight of my meal. LOVED it!  4 star mainly boosted by the amazing/friendly service!   TIP: order directly rather than through yelp for faster pick-up."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a healthy, tasty meal. It's not my favorite place for Mediterranean food, but it's close to work, the portions are good and she gives you a free bowl of soup while you wait for your food, which is nice. And I can tell the soup is a healthy addition and it's good (lentil).  I can't give it a higher scores because for me the hummus is good, but everybody makes their hummus different and while I like their hummus, I've had better at a few places (or maybe I'm just spoiled by my own hummus fusion - with cilantro and jalapeños). I also prefer basmati rice but I know that rice is super expensive now, so I don't blame a restaurant for not using it.  So it's a nice place to get a healthy, tasty meal."}
{"text":"The stars don't lie! We came here for the first time today and let me start off by saying the food was very delicious. We had the chicken lettuce wraps, two meat combo, gyro sandwich and a piece of their baklava yumm! In addition to their delicious food their staff is very friendly. Nino's (I hope I'm not misspelling his name :/ lol) hospitality was amazing he checked up on us to make sure everything was good and at the end of our meal he came up and introduced himself. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food and service. I accidentally found this place when stopping by Chino's for lunch. The complimentary chicken and potato curry soup was fantastic. I don't even like soup but I finished it all. I love gyro sandwiches and this place does them better than most I've had in town.   The service, as good as it gets. I went in and got more than I expected to for less money than I expected to spend. You can tell this place really wants the business and treats you like they do. I was surprised and impressed. I will be back."}
{"text":"Kefta, hummus, falafel, baklava, rice, complimentary soup all yum.      Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Holy friggin crap this food is amazing!  The guy at front counter was super nice and talked the food up for sure but when we actually got it he was not BSing us at all.  I am glad I know about this place now.  I will be a frequent flyer here!  The lunch special is unbeatable.  I promise you can't get fast food at this price that is this healthy."}
{"text":"Came in last week and got the lunch combo 3 meat plate and omg it was so good. The chicken was so flavorful and juicy. i do wish they would add more pieces of chicken. The rice was evenly cooked. The salad was ok I was more focused on the meat. The free soup I got the lentil was so good! And freeeee. Can't wait to come back. I would suggest to order ahead cuz it does take a long time for them to make the food."}
{"text":"I wnt back to Good Fellas and again had that Chicken Kabobs over rice.  The rice was perfect this time and the chicken was bursting with flavor and juicy.  The service was great, this has been my experience a majority of the team,  Thank you Ninos and team,  keep it up."}
{"text":"Excellent world-class food service in a unassuming location; if you want a meal Worth the drive and the money,this is where your car will take you.   Very,Very nice staff and the food is Delicious-WOW."}
{"text":"I've recently had an obsession with Mediterranean food so trying this place out(since it had so many great reviews) was a no brainer. And let me tell you I was not disappointed. The food is fresh, delicious, and affordable. They have a 5.99 3 meat lunch special with gyro meat, chicken and khafta."}
{"text":"Excellent ! First time there and already planning my next visit . Grilled to perfection, DELICIOUS !"}
{"text":"Best darn Mediterranean food I've had in a long time. My favorite is the Chicken Kabob's and also a Fatoosh salad . I mix the salad with the rice and chicken and the combination is so amazing . I make a similar salad at home , it's so addicting that I highly recommend trying the two together. My husband loves the lettuce wraps , I don't know why but it reminds me of tacos, I like this too , but I feel incomplete if I don't order my usual."}
{"text":"I've only been here once. It's in a strip mall next to Chino Bandido.  Hands down best gyro I've had in the Phoenix area.  I've been to many Greek restaurants all over town.  It was on a fresh warm/toasted pita with well seasoned good quality meat, combo price was $7.99. No comments on the rest of the menu items. I'll be back for more gyros and to try other items!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about this place, it is as good or better than most Greek places I have been to costing 2x as much, the soups were outstanding as were the kafta and chicken kabobs.  The gyro plate was very good as well. The staff was friendly enough to make you feel you were in their own home."}
{"text":"the lunch special is delicious 3 meat rice And salad for 6 dollars! the meat is juicy and seasoned perfectly! Ninos and his family are very nice and make it easy to contribute to local small business dining options!!  the kabob hindy and the fish are tasty and delicious! their gyros are good too if u want something familiar and quick. great hummus as well"}
{"text":"The man at the register (Nino's) I hope I spelt his name correctly was extremely humble and outgoing. He had a smile on his face and really made me feel comfortable and excited to eat at the establishment. The food was banging too! I got the number 7 (Two meat combo) and would recommend it!"}
{"text":"We were overnighting in Phoenix. We were tired and just wanted some cheap eats. We found this modest place in a strip mall. We were surprised that a free bowl of soup comes with each order. This night there was a choice between the lentil soup - their standard offering - and potato soup. We opted for lentil, which was delicious, but our waitress - the owner's niece insisted on giving us a bowl of soup also, saying, \"The potato soup is bomb - you may try it. It was amazing. I had the spanakopita; my wife the Greek teriyaki chicken. Both were delicious. Our total bill came to $18. Incredible value."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic hole in the wall place to eat. Check it out. The owners are gems and the food is great."}
{"text":"What an unexpected treat.  We didn't know what to expect.  It's located in a strip mall and both the outside and inside didn't appear impressive but my wife and I both had Shawarma combos that were massive and probably the most flavorful Greek wraps we've ever had.  The portions were huge too.  The family and staff that ran it were super friendly and provided excellent service.  We will definitely come back."}
