{"text":"I have been all over this menu. Great home style mom and pop restaurant!!! My favourite is the club sandwich, however instead of turkey I substitute chicken with rye bread. The green salad is another favourite. Also the chicken wraps, the Happy Burger is a must try.  Their breakfast is amazing too!! You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Awesome little diner for breakfast.  Amazing service, very friendly and smiley.  Prices are amazing, totally worth it for the amount of food you get!  Love it!"}
{"text":"Excellent diner, great all day breakfast & all served by some very nice people in a fresh clean environment. You'd never think to look back into this \"Colortown\" plaza for a diner but it's worth the diversion. Try the Happy Combo if you're really hungry & I think they've got an even bigger option."}
{"text":"I seem to be on a perpetual quest for the Perfect Breakfast Eatery.  It shouldn't be so complicated! After all it's just eggs, a meat protein, toast or pancakes and good coffee in a bottomless cup all served with a genuine smile.  I have yet to find this magical place but Happy's came pretty close.  My sunny side up eggs were cooked to perfection as were the sausages and bacon. Most restaurants fail in trying to achieve that simple task! Alex the server was smiling, cordial and \"happy\", a prerequisite of the job, I imagine. The tables were not crowded, temperature was comfortable, everything was spotless bs the atmosphere was happy and not noisy.      But there was one disappointment and it was the \"homefries\" which were not the traditional style (boiled chunks of potatoes fried on the grill with plenty of butter and onions, producing nice crispy crunchy bits of golden goodness)!  Instead these were precooked chunks of potatoes which were deep fried.....yuuuuuk! But fear not because you can substitute tomato slices for no extra charge or fresh fruit for a mere $1.75.     I still recommend this diner tho', it's pretty good and worth 4 stars."}
{"text":"The food arrived in a reasonable amount of time and the portions looked so good!  The Eggs Benedict included two poached eggs, toasted English muffin, ham, hollandaise sauce, and served with home fries.  What I loved most about this Eggs Benedict was that the poached eggs were perfectly done.  It was so soft and when I cut open the egg, the yolk oozed out beautifully.   The ham in addition to everything else was really good and it was a really solid and tasty Eggs Benedict!  The home fries were nicely crispy on the outside.  The Breakfast Poutine was a surprise to me!  I had never had anything like this before.  The Breakfast Poutine contained home fries with cheese, tomatoes, onions, bacon bits, hollandaise sauce, and a sunny-side egg on top.  It was a very good choice to order for breakfast or brunch if you want something other than just plain eggs and home fries.  It was tasty."}
{"text":"Pretty much a standard diner. For me, the tell tale signs of a truly good diner is quality of food and quality of service. The food was good. Not great. The coffee was terrible and the service, again was good not great."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service and good food. Our family of 6 had a great Canada Day breakfast thanks to Happy!"}
{"text":"Um, hello? Why are y'all still paying for sunset grill, eggsmart.. or worse.. CORAS?? Are we still living in 2012? No! Get your butt to Newmarket now and never go anywhere else for brunch.  Happy's is shown weirdly on the map, in a very unpopulated plaza north of the populated plaza with the metros and food spots. It's definitely busy though, especially on lunch hour on the weekend. Seating was super fast though, people usually eat and then they are out. Menu is huge and tempting. Pancakes and french toast look drool worthy. A whole meal with eggs, pancakes, homefries, toast, a bunch of meat is like $9-10. What the hell? I ordered 3 eggs + bacon, which came with home fries and toast and my bill was $8. What??? That is unheard of. Doesn't cora's charge $20 and a kidney for that? Food is pretty good, you can definitely make it at home but if you're lazy then why not come here? For $8, I ate a slice of the multigrain toast, 2/3 of my eggs and the bacon and was so stuffed I couldn't finish any of the home fries, the last egg nor the last slice of toast. I might settle and get the 2 eggs+ 2 pieces of meat for around $6 next time.  The only reason it's not 5/5 is because the service is a bit slow, but who can blame them? It's definitely busy with lots of buzz. They're always running around and super friendly though. This place is super simple and definitely a homey spot - I wouldn't go on a first date or anything here but take your parents here, your best friends, your significant other and they will love you for it."}
{"text":"I'm Happy.  Breakfast restaurants can be pretty binary--either they are downright good or stunningly bad.  We don't tend to settle for just average when there are so many choices around.  Happy All Day Breakfast sits squarely in the good column.  When I hit a place that serves me a great breakfast at a good price, with great attitude and service, I simply log it in as a preferred location and award it 4 stars.  5 stars gets reserved for the off-the-hook places that serve things like Smores French Toast, or Eggs Benny made with a perfect, scratch made Hollandaise.  So in my books, the difference between a 4 and a 5 is not quality, but level of difficulty.  Happy is on my list as a brekky place I will frequent without question."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast at an amazing price. 5.95 for breakfast you can't beat that. Servers are very friendly and food comes out quickly.   Smaller space with limited amount of seats, so if you're a bigger party there could be a slight wait.   I like that I could substitute my home fries for hashbrowns at no extra charge.   I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This little gem of a restaurant popped up on my phone this morning as a recommended place to do brunch in Newmarket. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food as I ordered the eggs benedict with pea meal and it compared to eggs benedict I've had elsewhere at four and five-star dining establishments. Perfectly cooked medium poached eggs with the most delicious hollandaise sauce made this meal super special. I have to mention the coffee served here. My waitress told me that it was from a commercial company and it was a Brazilian coffee. Honestly, it was one of the best cups I've ever had."}
{"text":"This place offers all day breakfast. Excellent customer service. The waitress was extremely friendly and proactively helpful.  Always with smile and asking if we need any help or need to refill coffee. Nowadays it is very hard to find this kind of service, especially when people are always in rush.  The washroom is very clean and refreshed.  The atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable.  The restaurant is clean and decorated with Christmas tree. There are background Christmas songs to boost the holiday season. The price is reasonable and food portions generous. The menu offers lots of options for you to choose. The food taste exactly what we were looking for, good. Will definitely come back again.  Only thing I think they could do to get 5 stars is if they could leave some different varieties of jam for us to choose,  not they choose to give us randomly. Moreover,  some more napkins on the table will be great.  Overall,  satisfied with the food and service.  Keep the good job!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place that near my hotel for a late Sunday breakfast. Found this place tucked into a strip mall. I decided to give it a try for something different. I had the big breakfast at 2 in the afternoon and it was excellent. Service was amazing and food was hot and not the type you would find sitting there all day. I will be back again when in Newmarket."}
{"text":"Super friendly service at a cozy family run restaurant. You're sure to get your dollar's worth here. Portions are very generous. Food is good."}
{"text":"Happy they are, creative...not so much.  My friend and I decided to try this place today. Simple diner with a steady stream of customers. Casual atmosphere with a semi-open kitchen in the back.  The menu covers the basics: breakfast, salad, sandwiches and other comfort favourites. It's actually fairly extensive that I didn't have a chance to look through all the options before it was time to order.  My friend had a hot turkey sandwich smothered in gravy and accompanied by fries and salad. I had the chicken Caesar wrap which consisted of chopped up chicken fingers and lettuce doused in Caesar dressing hugged in a whole wheat wrap. Fries were lightly salted.  My bottomless coffee was pretty standard but my eyes were more focused on my friend's hot chocolate with a tall swirl of whip cream and cinnamon (as much as I like coffee, I regretted not ordering the same thing).  Prices were very reasonable and staff were friendly; however, they only started coming around offering to refill coffee at the end of the meal.   I would definitely return when in the mood for a small-town-ish diner."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!!!! great breakfast place. the pancakes are my favourite!! very friendly staff"}
{"text":"We had a little bit of difficulty finding the location on the day before mother's day.  Happily, Google helped us out after the Yelp address lead us to an abandoned grocery store parking lot.  Its tucked away but you know what?  That adds to the charm!  This is a friendly full restaurant with cheerful and attentive staff.    My kids got crayons and paper on entering and their artwork is now featured on the art wall.    Food - plenty, good, yum.    We will be back."}
{"text":"For a standard all day breakfast family restaurant, food is nicely done.  Big , big portion.  For a quick bite in the area ... I recommend."}
{"text":"This restaurant saved my morning. I woke up with an immense craving for Tim Horton's breakfast burritos, but by the time we were ready to go, Tim Horton's breakfast hours were over. A quick yelp search for breakfast nearby brought us here, and boy, am I glad that Timmy's doesn't have all-day breakfast. You know what does have all-day breakfast? Happy. And I am so happy we found this place - never before have I experienced this amazing of a brunch meal - nay... a meal in general. The staff are so warm and friendly and genuine, the food comes quickly, and its not too pricey either. I ended up getting their Cali Benny with bacon (no breakfast burrito today) but it was 100% the right choice. I finished those two beautiful, loaded English muffins feeling satisfied, taste buds still swirling with the perfect mix of avocado, tomato, bacon, muffin, and egg. My favourite part of this dish was probably the shear amount of avocado there was - there was so much but not enough to be overwhelming. I'm so happy!!!! 15/10 would come again"}
