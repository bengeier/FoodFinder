{"text":"In town for business, found Yagyu on yelp and it did not disappoint! Clean, service quick and friendly. Food authentic and delish, it's hard to find a good Katsu Don...a family favorite...this was delightful!"}
{"text":"Good food and excellent friendly service! The menu items are priced very reasonable too!"}
{"text":"Best  ramen ive had in vegas so far, after going through quite a few places this place is our favorite yet! Staff is very polite and always greets us as we walk in. Nice set up for a ramen place unlike the other places this place has nice size tables compare to most ramen places."}
{"text":"We came in here on a whim because we didn't want to wait 20 minutes for sushi at Kaya next door. I got the miso ramen and my boyfriend had the shoyu. They were both very good, but we were a little disappointed that the egg is hard boiled. The service here is great, good ramen, liked the kimchi...The only thing that would keep me from coming back is that the soft boiled egg is my favorite part of ramen!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Had ramen like the old Togoshi ramen on Twain st that closed 7yrs ago!! Been looking for that same noodles everywhere & finally found it!!!' Yeah! The best oyaku donburi, gyoza, Mano tofu ramen& miso ramen! Found out chef is the same one at Togoshi!!! Will never eat ramen anywhere else !!!"}
{"text":"They have a huge variety of ramen. You can ask most of ramen to be spicy as well. We had Omelette ramen and Tanmen ramen. Tanmen had lots of veggies on top, the soup is Shio so pretty mellow and very good. We were told their Gyoza is made from scratch where many ramen places now use frozen stuff.  If Tonkotsu is too rich for you, this is a very good place to try. They have Shoyu, Shio, and Miso.   Very friendly service and the offered recommendations was dead-on. I will definitely be back next time when I'm in town."}
{"text":"We just came back to our hotel after eating at Yagyu Ramen. We ordered 3 different types of ramen(can't remember the names) and one donkatsu. The broth is very rich and ramen noodles were very good. Portion is large and price is very fair.  It tasted very authentic and the owners are very friendly providing great service.  They do need some promoting since it is fairly new but if you are a fan of ramen you will absolutely love their ramen so go help yourselves and this fine establishment as well."}
{"text":"Awesome little hole in the wall. The food was fantastic and hit the spot perfectly. Authentic and tasty Japanese food for a great price. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"So freaking good. Everything was great. Highly recommended and no wait like the other more popular options."}
{"text":"I'm glad to find this restaurant in Vegas. They have a wide variety of real Japanese style ramen noodles, Domburi and Combo meals. All I've been craving for.. yes, Ramen Yagyu is just like a casual neighborhood Ramen shop in  Japan? I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Having just relocated to Las Vegas from Hawaii,  my husband and I were in search of a restaurant to fulfill our cravings for Ramen and sushi. We're used to eating authentic Japanese cuisine in Hawaii,  and Yagyu Ramen did not dissapoint!!  We were greeted & sat immediately by a very sweet lady & I was delighted with the menu selections & low prices.  The food we ordered came quickly & was exceptional,  I ordered the Bento box ($6.95) & my husband ordered the Shoyu Ramen  ($7.50).  They were both full of flavor and generous portions. Also, the Thai iced tea was delicious!  We will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"So yummy, the yakisoba was amazing and the kimchi chicken udon was delicious. Definitely had a kick to it"}
{"text":"the food is close to perfection...tempura udon is the best  ingredients are fresh,combined with thai tea...that's awesome  oishi!!!"}
{"text":"Waited too long to get a seat.  Waited too long before someone would take my order.  I requested a specific bowl of ramen from the menu, but they said it wasn't available.  I told them that I don't eat seafood, but beef and pork were okay.  I requested a suggestion.  I ordered what they suggested.  When the bowl arrived, it had seafood in it (shrimp).  She offered to bring me a new bowl, but I didn't want to wait another hour for another bowl.  They were too busy to refill my water.  They are understaffed or poorly managed.  Regardless, I'm not going back."}
{"text":"If you don't want a ramen restaurant  that only consist of shoyu, tonkotsu, and shiyo. Then this is the place to go! For $8.50 you can get a bowl two times larger than both of your hands (if you're 5'5 female that is) I ordered a mapo ramen (mapo tofu ramen) and boy it was so good! They said it opened two months ago, so it's a pretty new restaurant. Try it! Worth the money in my opinion"}
{"text":"This ramen restaurant is fantastic!! They have your traditional and so many other kinds. The gentleman was so helpful with any questions we had about the menu. This place is great!"}
{"text":"Excellent Ramen....We first came to this place last year when they were serving premium meat and they were great then too. They are now focused more on Ramen with which they also do an excellent job. There are numerous Ramen houses in Las Vegas but all of the ones we have been to serve Ramen with very thick broths that have too much going on \"taste wise\". The Ramen here is the classic broth, simple but definitely tasty, similar to the broth served at Orochon Ramen House in downtown Los Angeles.  To boost the experience, the staff were great with customer service!!"}
{"text":"Yagyu ramen is definitely the best place in Las Vegas to get ramen. Their portions are amazing at such a great discount!  Ask for a stamp card when you go, you can discounts & food for free if toy go enough. The owner is awesome, the biggest sweetheart I've met in the ramen business. (:  Remembers her customers & treats everybody as an equal. Their food is traditional Japanese food, which I know well because my mother has made food. It tastes just like home. China town is never fun to drive in, but this place is worth it (: check it out. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This place is located in Chinatown @ Warm Springs Road and Arville at the far left end of a strip mall.  We got there at 8pm on a Sunday night.  I had to drive around the mall three times before I got a parking spot (they have stalls in the back, too).  It surprisingly was not busy and our party of five was seated right away.  We first went to Jinya down the road, but they had a line out the door. So some quick Yelping got us here.   Our server was very friendly and helpful with the menu.  They have a good selection of ramen and some other dishes.  I wasn't feeling ramen so I had the fried oysters with rice, some fresh veggies, and a bowl of miso soup.  It was delicious. Whenever I eat at a Japanese restaurant, I rate them by the quality of their rice, which was excellent.  The rest of my party had ramen and one had cold soba noodles.  They all mopped up their noodles and said how great tasting they were.  We shared the home made gyoza as an appetizer, which was very tasty.  I love this find and will be back.  PS: For dessert we headed to a Korean bakery located directly above Yagyu.  They have awesome bakery products!"}
{"text":"Fast service and ramen is delish.  Can't beat the price too!!!  Easy to get to and parking right in front...  Lunch time so not sure how the crowds will get during peak hours."}
{"text":"We love their shoyu ramen! Great Goyza as well! Friendly service. I recommend coming here! We come here everytime we are in vegas:)"}
{"text":"I am a professional noodle maker from Taiwan , this Ramen is so good , excellent experience in Vegas , will come back in next trip"}
{"text":"Delicious Japanese food at around $10, usually with a side of soup and salad. I ordered the fried oyster, which came out to less than $11. I definitely consider it worth its price."}
{"text":"A nice place in the Chinatown area of Las Vegas. The place is at least an average Japanese place that you can have in the area.  The food is good, they offer a good variety of Ramen and rice plates. The ambiance is great. I came on a bust night and the service moves on an average place. The servers are nice, they try their best to accommodate you A.S.A.P. I ordered the Changshu Ramen and it was good. The pork is cooked well and the noodles are just about right.  I would definitely recommend this as a good place to try ramen and those kind of food."}
{"text":"Me and my friends decided to come here for a late lunch/early dinner. I ordered a Oyakodon and my friends ordered a Tonkatsu, Bento Box and Chicken Curry, respectively. We were amazed by the food portions of how big it was. The waitress was very friendly and plus, food was tasty."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Not sure why their rating is so high because their ramen is mediocre. It was pretty salty for me so I assume there is a lot of MSG in the broth. I was very thirsty afterwards."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Ordered chicken katsu curry and karaage chicken.  Delicious and very affordable."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant. Great value and taste to go with it! A must visit when in China Town. All dishes made to order with fresh ingredients. I love this place. Staff is friendly, too!"}
{"text":"I like it here and the food was good! I would like to come back again sometime. I had the wantan-men. It wasn't too oily and greasy, if anything it was almost on the refreshing side of you compare it to many other places. The soup is simple, but well made and there's A LOT of menu options.  The only reason for me taking a star off is because when I went there, there was only one (older) lady running around on the floor! It took us almost 15 minutes to even get our menus. There were quite a few tables filled so it's not like she was just taking her time slacking off, but I would have been nicer for us to get the menu then wait for her to come so we can choose! From what I saw there was also only one person in the kitchen... I'm not sure if that's a regular thing, but don't expect to be in and out within 30min."}
{"text":"I love coming here. I don't come here often because we always go for the ayce sushi but every now and then we drop by and it's always a good experience. Their food is delicious and satisfying. There are a lot of great food options. The price is reasonable. Try their deep fried oyster. Really yummy.."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my Ramen filled with vegetables and chicken. It wasn't salty and a good sized portion. I would go back to avoid lines at Monta Ramen which I never tried yet."}
{"text":"I've been here three times and have only ever ordered yakiudon and crab fired rice. Haven't got tired of them yet!   Food is simple and unpretentious.   Not too busy at the moment, owner came out and greeted me, very friendly and humble.   Parking is atrocious in this plaza though, better to park next door at the China town plaza and walkover."}
{"text":"Sometimes you crave old fashioned, simple ramen. Yagyu Ramen has filled that spot for me with their straightforward, uncomplicated menu. Unlike the trendy, hip ramen places that have become popular in recent years, Yagyu sticks to the classics and does them well.   The tonkotsu ramen I had was flavorful and the noodles were at a good firmness (if anything the soup was slightly too salty for my taste), gyoza and  1/2fried rice I had were great as well. The simplicity of their menu items remind me of what I grew up on.   I've been here years ago when they were serving yakiniku, but I much prefer the current cozy and approachable atmosphere. Service was great - will definitely be returning. My only suggestion would be to provide some sort of combo meal - including ramen+gyoza+fried rice   Thank you!"}
{"text":"Reminds all 5 of us of food similar to Sumo Ramen or Ayame back in Oahu! We all, from the 8y/o to us 30 somethings say YAY, cause remind us of places in Kaneohe. Various noodle dishes from soba to udon and donburi bowls. Check it out!"}
{"text":"With such fierce competition in the Las Vegas Ramen space, Yagyu isn't a standout.  The ramen was just ok... the noodles were good... the soup broth was very weak.  The soba noodles on the other hand were pretty good!  Maybe a bit sweet, but much better than the ramen. Service was friendly and attentive... wish the food stood out more."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for somewhere new to eat but more specifically Ramen. All the popular spots were busy so we searched a little more and found this little gem.  The staff were overwhelming friendly and the service was as efficient.   More to the point though the food was as good as the service and the prices are reasonable.  We will definitely be coming back with friends and family."}
{"text":"This was an interesting place. We were looking for another noodle place but settled to eat here when our search ended up empty. My meal was pretty good, which was the tempura udon. My wife got a ramen but the broth was terribly salty and she was unable to eat most of it. When we first walked in to the restauant, we were not greeted by anybody. I had to walk towards the back until I found a waitress who assured me that they were open and then showed us to a table."}
{"text":"Great quick place for a nice hot lunch. They have different flavors of broth. The meat is really tender. And the service is great. One thing i didnt enjoy was the egg. I usually like it half cooked. But it was fully hardboiled. Other than that. Its a place i wouldnt mind going back to again. Especially since the prices are under $10"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place because of the great yelp reviews. I'm glad I did, there service was awesome and the ramen had great flavor."}
{"text":"Found a new ramen spot. This place got good food. I ordered the miso ramen and it's very yummy. My wife ordered the miso saba fish and that is great too. Definitely coming back to this joint."}
{"text":"I actually went there for nilareva liver & leek dish because i was dying for it but I haven't heard any restaurant in Vegas has.    Found out they discontinued    Darn it   :( Well so i had tanmen & my boyfriend had tenshinmen.  It was good   I really can't expect the taste like back home.  Most likely I will go back because waitress were very nice made me reminded of my mom & there is more variety of ramen than another ramen restaurant in town."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday night and it wasn't busy at all, food came out fast. The ramen I got was delicious, got a spicy level 8 and it wasn't that spicy at all but very flavorful. My friend got the vegetarian ramen and hated it, took two bites and couldn't finish it. The broth was too pungent. My other friend got curry and said it was average. I ordered egg rolls and they never came. Overall average experience for a ramen place."}
{"text":"When I'm in Vegas, I normally don't search for other restaurants besides the buffets here. But sometimes buffets can be overrated and standing in line for food can be annoying. So thanks to my Uncle and Aunt for introducing me to this restaurant.   This was my first time trying deep fried oysters and I was pleasantly surprised by how flavorful each bite was. I highly recommend ordering this appetizer. Some of their other standout dishes: I ordered their Nabeyaki Udon (It's a soup made with thick chewy udon noodles, vegetables, and a variety of toppings, depending on where you get it, from a poached egg to tempura shrimp, kamaboko  and chicken), very delicious. They also had a nice variety of ramen to choose from, everything tasted great. Their Unaju was very tasty as well. Overall, I give this restaurant 5 stars because of their delicious food and excellent service. Our waitress kept coming by to check on us and refilled our drinks without having to ask. She even cleared out our finished dishes so we could have more room. I also liked that they have a huge sign, advertising their frozen beer. I had a sip of it and it was very refreshing, perfect for cooling down in that Vegas heat! I will be back here again to try their other dishes.   Must try:  Frozen Beer Deep fried oysters Ramen Nabeyaki Udon Unaju"}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a good ramen place and we found so much more here! Super friendly staff, eager to help if you have questions about the food, very fast service and amazing food. It honestly doesn't get much better than this in Vegas.   We are looking forward to many more visits in the future. Well worth the 25 minute drive from the other end of the valley!"}
{"text":"I give this place one star for atmosphere : Japanese staff and Japanese customers everywhere,  and simple Japanese decor with no music playing. One star for pricing and portion size. I will not be able to finish this lunch, and I paid only $5.95 for it! One star for the staff, which is very fast, efficient and organized. Two stars for the food: unfortunately,  the miso soup is a little watery bland. However, the edamame was cooked just right, the California roll was nit too heavy on the rice, and the salad dressing was refreshingly light and sweet. I am not a fan of chicken teriyaki,  but I ate the entire thing here. The sauce was not thick or sweet,  but light and enhancing to the flavor of the chicken. The chicken was very soft and tender, which had me very surprised. Most places make it with thin, tough and dry cuts. The tea is a standard green and not too bitter strong. I will surely come back to this place to explore more of the menu next time!!!"}
{"text":"I came here with high expectations but was completely let down. Can you believe that they serve the egg fully cooked? That's just not acceptable. I got the miso ramen with an extra egg and although it's cheap, the quality was very mediocre. Broth was weak and noodles were overlooked. The eggs were halved and ice cold. I will never come back."}
{"text":"I love this place when it comes to a quick dinner or inexpensive restraunt. Not only are they inexpensive but it is worth it plus the quality of the food is outstanding! We usually order the takoyaki and any ramen pretty much you can customize itcto your preference."}
{"text":"We were in from out of town and looking for a good ramen place. Looked this one up on Yelp and decided to try it out. It's super close to where we were staying so that was a plus! The 4.5 stars (at the time I'm writing this) are well warranted. Great ramen (I had the charshu, my wife had the seafood version) and great service! The broth and pork were super tasty and the noodles were the right firmness and flavor. The ladies who waited on us smiled and were kind and helpful the whole time. I can tell an A+ joint when I see it, and this place isn't fancy decor-wise, but it's an A+ in my book!"}
{"text":"Chef Masa's 'mom and pop' shop serves nostalgic Japanese casual eats really well.  My father ( a sushi master)  and Chef Masa opened Vegas's best Japanese restaurant at the Wynn during the Casino's opening in 2006, I'm sure there is so much more behind chef Masa's culinary background , but his current shop,  YAGYU Ramen's menu has a pretty delicious spread.  He does over 10 different kinds of Ramens including ( Mabo-Ramen / Kakuni- Ramen / kimchee Ramen / even a Hiroshima style champon ramen ) * Curry Rice Dishes * Unagi Bowls  And many more nostalgic dishes to those who have lived in Japan before.   I had a super simple Shio Ramen ( plain clear broth)  It was the most perfect classic noodle the way it's served in Japan, straight forward ingredients and just delicious.   ????????????????????????????? YAGYU ?????????????????????????????????????????????1?????????????YAGYU-RAMEN, ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  ????* ?????????????????  ??????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Don't want to wait for good food? Bc yeah you got better things to do? You go for it!"}
{"text":"Great service and the food was authentic. I like the way they post specials on the wall. We always come to this place because there is no wait and the food is great! It was worthy every penny."}
{"text":"First time I've ever been here, I always go to Sora or Monta but I'm glad I decided to come to Yagyu! The instant you walk in you smell delicious broth.. The waitress there is thee NICEST & truly takes customer service seriously, you just don't see that anymore. The food portions are huge, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Delicious and tasty ramen. They have a mini combo with ramen, inari sushi and a small salad. The ramen was really tasty and full of flavorful broth. The inari and salad were both good. Also got a tonkatsu bento. The tonkatsu was perfectly cooked. Crunch on the outside but tender and juicy on the inside. Best of all are the prices. The mini ramen combo was $7. The bento was 8$. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Had been here before for BBQ and this time I had ramen and gyoza.  It was pretty darn tasty.  The beer was ICE cold too.  Wife really enjoyed her salad and chicken karaage also."}
{"text":"Kick ass food ! Super good .... Best service ! highly recommend , I've been in a lot of ramen places and this one is the best so far! I also own a restaurant so I know what's good:))))"}
{"text":"We decided to eat here cause we wanted to eat before we picked up some boba tea. Staff was friendly,  i got my free edamame for checking in,  and the place is cute.  But the tempura udon and the pork fried rice was aaight. You couldn't taste the pork in the fried rice, kinda bland. The udon was a bit undercooked, too even for someone like me who prefers noodles aldente.  Maybe i should have tried the ramen... i am leaving full but not satisfied."}
{"text":"Been here once and can only review from this experience.  It was busy to be expected at lunch time.  I found it strange that no one ever came to take my name down to be on the waiting list for a table.  I had to ask to get my name on the waiting list.  Communication became difficult when I could not communicate to the server if my soup was coming because mine was the only one not delivered.  When my soup finally came, it was quite satisfying.  I ordered what I thought only contained seafood, but I ended up having to fish out pork. That was my fault, I should have asked if it contained pork.  Other than that, it was quite satisfying."}
{"text":"This place gives very small portions of rice. And puts so much ice on their Thai tea, if you ask for no ice, they will charge you an additional .50 cents, and of course no free refills. Not highly recommended."}
{"text":"I can honestly say \"The best ramen I've had in Las Vegas!\"  The owner used to be the chef of the famous Togoshi Ramen that used to be \"the place for ramen\" until they went out of business a while back.  The owner of the Yagyu Ramen was the old Togoshi's chef when they were really good back in the 90s.  Today, I tried their miso ramen, and the soup was excellent!  So far, I've never found a place where the miso ramen wasn't as good as the Sapporo-ya in San Francisco's Japantown.  Today, I found it!  Yagyu's miso ramen!  It's very similar to the Sapporo-ya's original soup from the pre-90s.  Now I feel much better about living in Vegas. LoL  I've also had Yagyu's shoyu cha-shu-men and Nagasaki chanponmen and they are all excellent! What I found interesting is that traditional Nagasaki chanpon uses slightly thicker curvy noodle, but, Yagyu uses a regular ramen noodle, which draws the soup better when you eat it.  Yagyu's chanpon soup is a bit on the mild side, and is NOT loaded with lard like the traditional Nagasaki chanpon, which make it perfect for this noodle.  The veggies in the chanpon are cooked to a perfect \"Al Dente\" and, is crisp!"}
{"text":"What a nice, cute, Japanese Ramen restaurant. We were holiday shopping at the plaza next door when we decided we needed some hot ramen to warm us up. A cleanly interior, genuinely friendly staff, a large variety of tasty ramen dishes, and reasonable prices make this a 4 Star experience.   CLOSED on Mondays."}
{"text":"The best ramen place in Vegas! From 11am to 11:30 pm goodness, friendly staff (sang) compare to m.... or S... Clean and spacious, definitely recommendable, can't wait to come back for more!"}
{"text":"After a really bad experience of below average tasting ramen at Go!ku across the street, I came here to eat another bowl of ramen. Here the spicy tonkotsu ramen is lots better. The place is like a cafeteria.  Soup is very spicy. The spiciness and tonkotsu flavor blends well together, unlike the other place where it felt like they just added some spicy sauce straight from the bottle.  One problem with their ramen is they don't know how to make shoyu egg, and only offer hard boiled instead.  It's not great here, but definitely not bad."}
{"text":"Went here about a month ago. The food is great! I had the wonton ramen with some kimchi in it. Really good! And had an order of gyoza (potstickers). Great food at a great price! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"They didn't have a meatless ramen option on the menu.  She created one for me! amazing service & amazing Thai teas!  They have a buy one get one on Thai teas and boba teas! My hubby had pork fried rice said it was the best he ever had.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Living in L.A., there are more Ramen places per capita than any other place.  I don't know why more Ramen shops haven't opened up around the country.  Vegas also has its share of many Ramen houses, but most of them are pretty good.  Having frequent Monta and Sora, I didn't think this place could match them.  Noodle quality is top notch and among the best here.  Broth is very good, but I may have to give Monta and Sora a slightly higher score with their broths.  However, this place trumps those two outstanding places with the other choices.  You can get Udon and Soba that cannot be found at the other places.  You can even get Yakisoba.  Another difference, their soup comes out boiling hot.  You may need to blow on your spoon or wait a little while, but as for me, I don't like warm soups, I like them hot.  This place is friendly and parking can be challenging.  But you can always park next door in the Plaza and walk over if they get filled up.  Unlike Sora and Monta, I haven't stood in long lines waiting to just get a table.  That may be good enough for me to frequent this place over the other places."}
{"text":"After days of having fancy (cold) food on the Strip, we decided to explore something cozy and warm in the cold winter. So we found this place - and it did not disappoint us. We ordered three appetizers, miso ramen, shoyu ramen and the one with egg on top. Portion was just right and tasted good. We liked their Thai tea as well."}
{"text":"First time here! Was looking for a place that has a variety of ramen, and luckily came across this one that has mabo ramen! It was good! add the japanese chili to give it more of a kick! Would definitely come to try other dishes they have here."}
{"text":"This shop is cozy, high quality,and cheaply priced for the large amounts of flawless food.  The katsu Donburi was delicious, filing, and surprisingly light of texture. What is usually a heavy, greasy dish was instead graced by a light sauce with much impact, workout overshadowing other parts of the dish. It serves as a perfect don, all ingredients working harmoniously.   The karaage were well seasoned and had perfect texture,mouth feel, and fat content. Crispy outside and moderately chewy meat. I miss fukumimi's seasoning salt mix though.   No complaints about the cold soba.  What stood out to me the most was the umani ramen. At first, I was apprehensive about the thickness of the mushroom broth, but the compound action of the shiitake, the seafood, the pork, and the compendium of vegetables made every mouthful new and unforgettable. The multitude of flavors find not competition, but useful collaboration to make a seamless amalgam of impactful umami. Delicious to the last slurp.  Not to mention, the old lady on duty is very kind,and the kitchen is prompt. I wasn't expecting such an amazing lunch break, and I'll be back."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service is amazing. The servers speak Japanese, are very energetic and friendly. They're very observant so if it looks like you need anything, they come to you right away. I definitely recommend this place :]"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Best Thai Coffee ever, and they are buy one get. #Winning  I stumbled across this place one trying to kill some time. I tried the Thai Coffee and I have been a fan every since. The Bento box special is delicious as well as the Miso Ramen. Babe tried it for the first time and loved it. Haven't tried much of their sushi. I did have California roll however, that was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"We were craving ramen but didn't want to wait forever at one of the more popular spots so we decided to give this place a shot.  There was another couple there eating but other than that, no one else. The waitresses greeted us very happily, loudly, and in Japanese. We took our seats and we both wanted the Miso ramen with corn added.   After we put our orders in I looked at the walls and saw they had Fresh Squid, so we ordered one of those too. Our ramen came out and it was absolutely amazing. The broth is so flavorful and made me all warm inside, yummmm. But the Pork wasn't as tender and it didn't melt in my mouth like at some of the other ramen places I've tried. It was more tough and thinly sliced.   **I went a second time for a bowl of Tonkotsu Ramen. The pork was very tender this time and definitely melted in my mouth. I also think the Tonkotsu broth was even better than their miso. They are my #1 favorite ramen spot, at the moment!**  The squid was so good! The sauce all over it was perfect, I could eat the whole thing by myself. Mmm mmm mmm.  The waitresses were friendly and quick. The inside of the restaurant is homey and comfortable. I liked it here. If I'm ever in a rush and I need ramen, I'll definitely be stopping here!!"}
{"text":"Came here because of the reviews on yelp.  The servers are definitely nice, but the ramen was disappointing.  I got the miso ramen and my husband got charsiu ramen.  The meat came out cold, eggs were completely overcooked, and the soup got cold really fast too.  We did not get any seaweed in the charsiu ramen, as shown in the menu pictures, and we only got 1 extra piece of charsiu compared to the shoyu or shio ramen.    They have many other options of ramen though, if you like varieties, but if they can't get the basic stuff right, I'm not sure I'll come back for the others.    I think they could also do better with their menu pictures too, they are so blurry!"}
{"text":"The pictures of the tenshin ramen drew me here. I'm going to echo the \"meh\" of other reviews.   Pros:  they are extremely generous with the omelette. And I think it was well done.  The server was friendly and attentive.  Their menu has lots of variety. I think if I came here for the beef bowl or another rice dish I would have been satisfied but alas I had to try the omelette ramen.  As other ppl say, the soup is piping hot.   Con: the noodles and the broth were so basic. Like out of an instant pack. And eating the noodles in combo with the omelette worked, but when I ran out of noodles, I lost the desire to finish my dish.   Overall just a meh. I'm a big Sora fan. I'll probably stick with them and go to other places when I'm in the mood for other things except a beef bowl. I still wanna try theirs"}
{"text":"Walked in on a Thursday night with an appetite for noodles and I got just that and zero wait. There was only 2 other people eating in the restaurant. Was not exactly sure what to make of that with a 4 star rating here on Yelp.  My date and I were wanting Ramen but  I thought that it was just OK here. It was the miso Ramen which I thought would taste like miso but it did not.  Maybe miso Ramen is different than regular miso soup? But it was decent I will say.  I ended up getting some Udon (tempura) instead of ramen and it was excellent! Really enjoyed the flavor and the noodles were cooked just right. The soup was hot and great to the last bite. Also ordered a salmon sushi roll and I would say it was a 5 out of 10. Very basic with not a lot of taste. With a little soy sauce though, it was good.  I would definitely go back for the Udon but I will have to try a Ramen dish next time as I don't think I will be getting the miso Ramen."}
{"text":"3.5. Low key, welcoming, and affordable. Located in the same packed shopping complex as Ichiza and a bubble tea shop.   I really like that this place doesn't nickel-and-dime the hell out of you when it comes to toppings on your ramen.   Chashu ramen: the good: four tender, fatty slices of chashu in there, broth not too salty the meh: egg was overcooked, noodles were not as enjoyable as Monta or Sora.   I am a super honey toast fan, and I can't say it's my favorite here. Texture-wise it needed more crunch and was missing a little something. Bottom pieces were just a little too cloyingly sweet with the amount of honey on the plate.  Kudos to these guys for the free Yelp check-in app of yakisoba, but it was a little too sweet for me.   Good food with great service and lots of old Japanese grannies hobbling in and out of the restaurant, but not the ramen place I'd crave as my first option when in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love katsudon and they did it good here. Miso soup was very good too. My hubby liked his ramen. We will be back to try the rest of the menu. Love the Thai Coffee $2.99 BOGO. Restrooms are very clean which is a plus."}
{"text":"I loved this place!  There's a cute Japanese Lady running the front of house. The food was really good.  We had an assortment of Ramens and plates as well as gyoza.  It was all wonderful and the price-I think the ramens were only $8 per bowl.  One of the cheapest meals we had on vacation.  :)  I would definitely go back and recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"Yay!! It's Back from the Days of my UNLV days ! The owner of our Favorite Ramen Spot from the Past is Back! Yay! For the Beer! And Yay for the Ramen! Whoot! It got scored low for no more Yagyu// but the Owner had the right stuff in mind!!! Love it! Thank You! New Spot from Sora and Monta!"}
{"text":"I tried Yagyu because Ichiza was closed. So glad I found this spot it was lunch time and my boyfriend and I were looking to eat something really quick. Service was friendly and fast. Such nice staff. I ordered the chicken curry and loved it!!! I was so mad I couldn't finish it all. My boyfriend tried the bento box special he also loved it! We started out with dumplings and I would have to rate them a 10! Overall love this place and will be coming back !"}
{"text":"First time and definitely not the last time! Great authentic Japanese food and awesome service! Not sure if he's the owner/manager but gave  suggestions on the dishes and they were all good! Very flavorful and good portion! Price was very reasonable as well. We definitely recommend this place for good Ramen and Japanese food!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered 3 different bowls, and they were all delicious! Portions were good sized and service was great. I loved the Thai tea as well."}
{"text":"Had Thai tea and tonkatsu ramen. The broth of the ramen was great and the egg was soft boiled perfectly. The pork was flavorful and the chili oil at the table was a delicious add. It felt like a place you would find in Tokyo with so many additional options written on papers placed around the restaurant and the wood details. I would return because of the broth and the price."}
{"text":"Prices were decent but the quality of the food were mediocre. I've had better ramen dishes in AZ sorry. I wanted to give this place a try because of the reviews I saw and I wanted to support the smaller shops. I will give Ramen Sora a try next time I am in town to give a comparison review. Stay tuned!"}
{"text":"We're spoiled in Vegas with the numerous ramen spots there are.  Yagyu Ramen is in a crazy busy two story building on a lot with parking that requires tactical driving skills.  It also sits diagonally across Pho Kinh Doh... I just wanted to say that.  Not too busy when we entered the restaurant however.  Only the parking seemed to be a hassle.  With the great reviews and star rating I think I expected greatness.  Such was not the case.  Only a couple downers.  They forgot my sprite order, and good no charge for it.  And their menus were handwritten, taped to the wall plus an actual menu to view choices.  We were looking everywhere just to order.  That called for a beer pitcher.  We enjoyed their ramen soup anyway.  Soup was not over salted.  Noodles had good texture.  Portions were average.  The broth was not actually fatty gags tasting!  Thank goodness.  And service was okay.  I'll keep it neutral."}
{"text":"My brother was in town and we were craving some ramen. We haven't ever been hear or heard of it, but we decided to give it a shot.  The inside looks really nice and felt homey to me. We were sat and greeted by a really nice waitress. They have a menu with a decent amount of items and specials they post on the board by the front entrance and around the restaurant. My family and I ordered ramen and yakisoba. We didn't take too long before we got our food. The ramen was pretty good, but not the best. To me, the yakisoba had a strange taste to it, even though my other family members didn't think so. I definitely would not mind coming back, especially with how courteous the waitresses were with me and my family, but I'd just order other things to get a better idea of the entire menu."}
{"text":"I've waited for 1/2 an hour to get in at Ramen Sora, so not having to wait at all at this restaurant is refreshing.  The ramen was just as good and full of veggies. We checked in on Yelp & received a free appetizer. Both my husband and I thought the service was excellent & the food quality exemplary. Cute deal - the Thai iced tea is BOGO - and our waitress was kind enough to give me my 2nd in a to-go cup with a straw. Very thoughtful!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best ramen(Japanese ramen noodle)restaurant in Las Vegas !!! I tried cha-shu ramen!! I really love the taste! Very good volume!! The service was excellent!! I can tell they do very honest and clean job. The taste of cha-shy ramen makes me feel like I am in Japan!! So if you want to real taste of Japanese ramen,this is the one!!! This is the best real ramen restraint in the town!!   ???????????????????? ?????????????????????? ???????????????  ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ????????????????? ?????????????????? ???????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were a little high considering the 5 star reviews but I was disappointed. The ramen was okay but the broth could have used more flavor and the pork was kind of dry. Also the egg was a standard hard boiled egg instead of the marinated seasoned soft boiled egg, which did nothing for my noodles. My friend got the wonton soup but it was just wonton wrappers. I'll go to ramen soya, monta, or jinya over this place."}
{"text":"I love to try ramen (if available) wherever I travel.  I came to Yagyu around 9pm on a Friday night and the place was almost empty.  The staff was extra friendly and I overheard them and a couple patrons speaking Japanese so I had high hopes despite the lack of customers.  I promptly ordered the chashu ramen and gyoza.  Both arrived simultaneously so I went for the gyoza first. The gyoza wrappers were super tender but I found the ratio of cabbage to pork in the filling was too high for my taste. That may be a good thing if you are looking for a healthier gyoza with a softer texture, but I like mine porkier.  I would rate the ramen above average but definitely not in my top rankings.  The chashu was moist and tender and the noodles had a toothsome bite.  But the broth could have been more flavorful and rich.  I don't get to eat ramen often so I want to be hit with some salt and fat.  The egg was hard boiled but I prefer the soft barely-set yolk variety.    I'd definitely come back to try some other dishes since they were so friendly but I definitely want to try Monta's ramen to compare next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Another great ramen house in Spring Mtn with good amounts of seating. & there's no crazy wait time.  I feel like this is a hidden gem (for now), because there's other places like Ramen Sora & Monta Ramen that are almost ALWAYS packed and crammed with their parking situation not being the greatest either. I'm glad this place isn't at the point yet because sometimes I just want a good bowl of ramen without having to write my name down after 8434984 people ahead of me.  The menu is more extensive then other ramen places because they also serve other hot meals. They also have various ramen broths to choose from. Personally, I really enjoyed the ramen omelette. I like to order with extra charsu slices for my meat fix. I like how they have more than just a few broth options cuz sometimes I get tired of miso, shoyu, and tonkatsu :p The charsu slices are nice and big too unlike Monta where I take like 2 bites and I'm out of meat already :( & the broth and ramen itself are very flavorful. Service is quick and they also give you a stamp. Will definitely return here to try their rice plates."}
{"text":"Monta, sora, tatsu are always busy. I also like it its next door to Chinatown. Somewhere to go after eating."}
{"text":"It was Christmas day and we happened upon Yagyu restaurant.  We were hungry, and craving ramen. The Mabo and Champon ramen were both excellent! The broths were authentic,  and perfectly seasoned. The noodles were delish and abundant. ..never ending bowl of delicious ramen noodles!!!  We also enjoyed the spicy tuna & CA rolls...SO scrumptious! To find authentic Japanese comfort food in the middle of LV, was incredibly amazing! The service was excellent, quality and quantity of food exceptional. Great value and dining experience. We can't wait to return!!!"}
{"text":"Cozy little place with friendly n excellent service. My son n I had shoyu ramen n jyan ramen...both were delicious. All in all, this place has great food at a great price! Will be back to try other things"}
{"text":"Ordered miso, tanjin and champon ramyun. Champon was the best out of all three. Miso was..ehhh. But the thai tea is SO GOOD! Buy 1 get 1 free for $2.99!! I would come back for champon ramyun and the Thai tea :)"}
{"text":"The ramen was awesome and gyoza! Will definetly stop here again for the long drive going to utah!"}
{"text":"This is the Japanese-style ramen for which Japanese people are looking.    After visiting Sora, Monta, and Jinya my Japanese friend said this ramen is most authentic.  She ordered the chanpon ramen.  I thought the gyudon beef bowl was also delicious.  Once word spreads, this place will be popular."}
{"text":"This is definitely some comfort food. My sister, and I order Shio / Shoyu ramen with the ice beer. The ramen was really enjoyable, and the broth was on point. The beer was super icy, and went well with it. The service was awesome! I can't wait to come back again =]"}
{"text":"Love this place, food was on point, I had an omelet in my ramen, and veggies. The goyza was crunch on one side, steamy on the inside.  Perfect!  Check them out, it is a small place so you might want to expect a little wait!    I love a good bowl of ramen on a cold day."}
{"text":"Hey locals, this is Togoshi's resurrection. He's back. The only difference is the missing Japanese manga bookshelf. Finally, the real thing again. This isn't the type of place you post on social media, you just go for the food."}
{"text":"I thought this place was quite nice. The service was very good. They seem to value you as a customer. They would also give you recommendations. I thought the food was very fresh. They also occasionally check up on you as you eat, to make sure you are having a good meal. I thought overall it was a good first experience  here."}
{"text":"Monta was crazy busy, so we ended up here. Ramen was decent, but apparently our waitress didn't know how to split a bill 4 ways? She was nice enough, but I ended up paying $18 including tip for a $9 bowl of ramen. So, yeah."}
{"text":"It was okay. Egg was cold hard boiled. Everything mediocre. Chicken karaage were poor quality pieces. Disappointed but people were very nice."}
{"text":"New owner, refurbished with new floors, layout, and tables, booths, chairs.  Great looking inside and very comfortable.  Couple of large flat screens for sports lovers. One of the best Japanese restaurants in town.  Curry is unbelievably delicious and you get lots.  The prices are reasonable.  Ramen is to die for.  For those who like Okinawan food, keep your eye out for Okinawa soba coming soon.  Fried rice is the best.  Will be eating here as much as my wallet will let me!"}
{"text":"Ramen was fantastic. My girlfriend and I always went to Sora but decided to come here and we're extremely surprised. The ramen had more flavor and was much less salty than sora. They have a lot of great options as well. The beef bowl was amazing and they have an awesome bento box option for only 5.95. Definitely should check it out if you haven't."}
{"text":"New Ramen place so we gave it a try.   I had the Bento box: which has miso soup, chicken, California roll, salad, rice and edamame.  Pretty good deal at $5.95, however,  the miso soup was flavorless, the chicken teriyaki was dry. The California roll looked disgusting. But at least the salad was fresh.  My companion had the ramen shoyu. Flavor was lacking. He said it's average at most and he had better in other ramen places.   The server was nice though, and the place is clean. As for the quality of food, we've had better.  I'll think twice before coming back."}
{"text":"I got the $6.95 deal with half order of miso ramen,   Two pieces of the sushi, and mini salad. It fill me up. It was so delicious. The broth was awesome. My friends ordered the udon which looked really good as well. I don't think you can go wrong with anything here."}
{"text":"Found this wonderful restaurant by chance while looking for another Ramen place. We ordered the Champton and Umani Ramen and both were tasty. We also ordered the Seaweed Salad and KaraAge. They had a special going on for Thai Ice Tea - buy one, get one free so of course I got a free one.   If we are ever back in Vegas, we will be back!"}
{"text":"If you know me, you know I'm a huge fan of ramen, especially during the winter/colder months when you need the soup to warm up your body. Seeking a new ramen place near Chinatown (since my favorite ramen places are further away), I pulled out Yelp. This place offered free edamame upon check-in, so who doesn't love that?! (Yes, I LOVE edamame!)  Upon arrival, we were greeted and led to our table. I like the interior - had a very informal but authentic Japanese coziness. Next we ordered the edamame and seaweed salad to start then ordered the ramen.  Food - 8/10. The edamame was delicious (but I'm not sure how you could mess that up anyway). I took off some ratings because I wasn't so fond of the seaweed salad. I am a huge fan of seaweed salads but for some reason did not like the way this tasted. I can't put my finger on it, but there was just something 'off' about it. Wouldn't order it again if I came back. Our main course, the ramen, was good. I ordered the Shoyu ramen and it was very fulfilling. The broth was great - not too salty, not too tasteless.  The staff was very friendly and attentive. My boyfriend had some questions and the waitress answered everything. He ordered his food per her recommendation and he enjoyed it.   Overall, my experience here was not negative, but nothing stood out to me. I'd consider coming back here simply because the location is convenient."}
{"text":"Popped in here for a quick dinner and was not disappointed by all the good Yelp reviews! I ordered the sliced pork ramen with the free yakisoba appetizer (with Yelp checkin). Both were delicious!  The broth was amazing and the sliced pork was really tender and flavorful. Their noodles are nothing too special but go well with the rest of the delicious bowl of ramen. The yakisoba was really good too but I would rather have more ramen!  Service was incredibly fast (it wasn't very busy on a Sunday night) and polite. Nothing to do with the restaurant but Parking in the plaza sucks and is jammed with Asians who can't drive!"}
{"text":"This place goes on my top 5 ramen restaurants. Loved the authentic ramen and the variety of ramen.  They also have soba, which I don't really see in other Japanese restaurants.    I had the Shoyu Ramen and my mom had the seafood ramen (forgot the name).  Looking forward to trying the other dishes.  Met the owners, very friendly and the place as spacious - plenty of room.  Not small like a typical soba or ramen house.  I highly recommend this place on your to go list!"}
{"text":"Omg. So good and so inexpensive.  I would definitely suggest having the Kim chi ramen..  slightly spicy  (like it should be) and so delicious.  2 for 1 thai tea with Boba too!"}
{"text":"You can get pretty decent tasting Japanese food here at very affordable prices here. Service is nice and prompt too. Can't beat it for overall value."}
{"text":"Umani ramen was pretty meh, overall I was disappointed.   The good: mushrooms and the soup base were delicious.  The bad: a seeming grab bag of meats and seafoods felt like dredging the bottom end of a hot pot. Amature hour noodles. Think Top Ramen bricked noodles but slightly overcooked. The ugly: It looked as if someone took my ramen and threw it in a cocktail shaker before its was bowled. Presentation left a lot to be desired.  Some of my friends go udon ramen and charsu ramen which looked a lot better, if I were to go again I would try one of these; that said nobody in our group of six was super impressed with the food."}
{"text":"Portions on some items are huge some are not, this place is a little pricier than what I am used to, but was great nevertheless !  We made a reservation just in case due to our large (17) group and we were one of 2 groups there at the time. Service was phenomenal they accurately and efficiently took our orders down and even gave us 3 edamame on the house when I showed the server my checkin offer!  It wasn't on the menu but on paper taped to the walls, I ordered a basic tonkotsu ramen. It was a nice amount for ($9) and even had a spicy version of it as well. Friends around me ordered other various things and all loved their food.  However, PEANUT ALLERGY BEWARE! A half Japanese friend in the group has an extreme peanut allergy and but didn't think twice on ordering the tonkotsu ramen. Took a sip of his soup and in a minute he was already looking uncomfortable. We asked the server to ask if there was any peanut oil or any nuts that she came came from the chef and said no. Our friend had to chug water and ended up getting food next door.  Aside from the allergy fiasco, service was great and so was the food"}
{"text":"I haven't even finished my food yet and I have to say THE HYPE IS REAL!! This place is absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Friendly Fast service and cheap food. Will def come back when in Vegas"}
{"text":"I've been to Monta and this is very comparable to the quality of ramen. The noodles are thick and chewy just the way an authentic Japanese ramen should be. I will come back here again."}
{"text":"Fresh fresh, well prepared, great service. This was AUTHENTIC JAPANESE. Lunch Bento box special was insanely good deal @ $5.95. Coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant. I went here with my son and we really enjoyed both of our Ramen dishes. I would definitely come back to this location."}
{"text":"With so many options in Las Vegas, we ate dinner at Yagyu twice.  The ramen is delicious, authentic, and the service is friendly.  The first night, on a Friday night, the place was packed, and we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. The next day, a Saturday, we had no wait but the place was full.  So all the talk about the place being unknown is NO LONGER the case.    My husband had the charshu ramen with extra charshu on the first night, and he said it was out of this world.  He eats ramen frequently.  I had the umani ramen, which is some squid, a shrimp, pork, in an extremely delicious savory broth.  Super yum.  The second night, my husband had shio ramen, and I had the tanmen ramen; both were much milder than the ramen we had the previous night, but also good.  I think the tanmen broth is mostly chicken broth, and therefore familiar to my palate, and might be well-suited to a ramen newbie.  Also the tanmen is chock full of veggies, which is great.  However, the umani is def my favorite.  The dishes are about $10 each.  Expect to wait for your ramen, and the soups do not necessarily come out at the same time.  On the first night, there was at least 12 minutes between my husband's soup service and mine.  That's pretty poo.  Chinatown has so many of these gems in Las Vegas! The whole area is worth exploring."}
{"text":"Above all else the service was excellent, extremely attentive and curteous.  Their kimchi fried rice was perfectly flavored with just the right mix of spice.    They were quick to seat my party of two upon arrival and the relaxed atmosphere was welcoming.  Overall a nice new find and at a very reasonable price!"}
{"text":"The weather has definitely cooled down, so on our most recent trip to Vegas towards the end of October, we felt like something hot & soupy. The Yelp app came up with a few selections, but Yagyu stood out, partially because of the high ratings, but it was also within a mile from where we stayed (Palms Place)   Upon entering on a Wednesday evening around 7ish, it was nearly empty. A nice lady escorted us towards the back to a booth. The menu was packed with pictures of different types of ramen but with no description. Instead of staring at the menu and asking a million questions, we went with something familiar:  Japanese Won Ton Ramen: great broth, chewy noodles and tasty won tons. Really hit the spot.  Miso Ramen: this place has absolutely the most tender slices of pork I have EVER had. The texture was almost like eating fat, where it just melts in your mouth, but it's actually lean pork. The broth was a bit on the salty side but overall, still great. Thai iced tea, BOGO @ $3. tastes like all others from other places.   We were happy to see they had a lot more business when we left. The service was absolutely perfect. They are so friendly and hospitable. I love the fact that it appears to be owned by an older couple, that they are so nice and the food was pretty tasty. I recommend Yagyu for anyone looking for some hot, soothing ramen w/ the approaching cold weather.   Please go support these nice people! I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I'm picky about my ramen; very picky. Yagyu was AWESOME. I tried Monta Ramen across the street and Yagyu has them beat! You can choose your level of spicyness on a 10 level scale. The broth was well seasoned and the noodles were perfect. I normally don't eat the pork in ramen because it's too gamey, but I demolished the entire bowl. This is definitely a local's spot nestled in between foot spas and tea stores, but I promise it doesn't disappoint.   Ramen goes really good with beer, so of course I asked the server for a glass of Sapporo. She asked me, \"is frozen beer okay?\" I was so confused. \"Did she mean a frozen glass? Did they forget to take the beer out of the freezer and now it's seconds away from combustion?\" I didn't think I heard her correctly so just smiled and said ok. OMG she really came back with frozen beer. The Sapporo was served in a chilled beer mug and it was legitimately a beer slushie!!!! It was amazing.   Did I mention that this place is pretty cheap? I mean you really can't go wrong with ramen, beer slushies and the feeling that you didn't just get ripped off in Vegas."}
{"text":"Edamame is not fresh as it was boiled frozen edamame.  Jyan Ramen (spicy tonkotsu) is spicy as the name suggests.  However, the base tonkotsu is a bit sweet, but bland. Taste more of a dairy base rather than pork.  Two thin slices of cha shu is ordinary: tender, but not melt in the mouth.  Although Nitamago has a slightly melted yolk, it's a bit salty.  Noodle is wavy and looks to be egg noodle.  Included are green onion and zasai.  Overall, it's not to die for and is nothing beyond ordinary. For $10.95, it's over priced for the quality.  The shoyu ramen is better, but not by much.  It's a bit light on the flavor.  Same noodle, menma, white boiled egg, and same noodles.  For $7.50, it's ok.  Service was very good though.  However, regardless of the service, the main purpose of the restaurant is the food, service is secondary."}
{"text":"Waited to review this restaurant after having been here 3 times.  Porn katsu is very good. Great batter and flavor Grilled eel over rice. This is basically Unagi on steroid. Entire bowl of rice covered in Unagi or grilled fat thick eel. Rice is drenched in Unagi sauce. This item is a rarity in the states. If you enjoy Unagi you will like this  Beef bowl was ordered without vegetable. Very good dish for those who don't like vege in their beef bowl.  Ginger Pork has awesome flavor. Large slices of pork sautéed with thin slices of onion and ginger. Pork slices is infused with hint of ginger and lemon.  Kakiage over rice. The Kakiage is chopped prawns  deep fried in sliced onion, carrot, and other vege. With a sunny side up egg on top. This is okay, differs from other Kakiage I had before.  On to appetizers. Chicken Kara-age is average. Large chicken pieces fried in flavored batter.  Gyoza is outstanding - must order. Very thin skin pan fried crispy with tasty filling. Been trying new dishes, Ginger Pork, Pork Fried Rice, both are excellent dishes"}
{"text":"A nice hidden gem on the outskirts of Vegas! If you want authentic Japanese food, you should come here!  We were greeted by a cute Japanese lady. Their menu offers ramen, rice bowls, appetizers and drinks.  What we tried: *Tempura Udon - Very good! The noodles were cooked perfectly. The broth was light and comforting. The shrimp tempura was really good! The batter was light and crispy. *Spicy Char Siu Ramen - Very good! The level of spice was medium and just right. They are generous with the pieces of char siu they give you.  For Thai Tea boba lovers, this place offers BOGO free!  There is a lot of free parking in the lot."}
{"text":"Should have known when it's prime dinner time and no one was in the place. First the yakisoba free item was less than an appetizer portion more like a bite of crappy old noodles. Better not to offer it. I had the shoyu ramen special which was like soy sauce water with some package ramen. The other thing we ordered was the mackerel which was like he sardines in a can that I get for 99 cents at 99 ranch market. All in all, place was  awful and never coming back again. The previous yelpers who positively rated this place was probably related to the owners."}
{"text":"EXTREMELY UNDERRATED! First off I was shocked that no one was in here and it was just me and my boyfriend. This is a relatively new ramen-based restaurant. The previous ownership was Japanese BBQ and I promise you will not be disappointed with the change!   Upon walking in I was intrigued with the buy one get one free Thai tea signs! They are my weakness and ultimately I do believe that they do match up to their prices and are worth every penny. Would come here just for the bobas! Tea station who?!   Food: HUGE proportions. Working at a restaurant myself, I know when restaurants cheat off their food. While I didn't order there ramen, I was extremely pleased with there curry! The food actually had real chicken breasts. Best part of all? At max 10 minutes for such an amazingly large proportion! Big enough to satisfy bodybuilders too! :)   Atmosphere: Authentic Japanese vibe and such a clean interior! Bathrooms are obviously monitored almost after every use! I was very shocked with the conditions of the entire restaurant. Plus the music isn't so loud and it helps a lot because the servers are always in sight!   Service: outstanding service! Not only are they extremely friendly but they always remain extremely professional. They knew when to have humor and when it's time to order, they get down to business. Overall, i have recommended this location to all my friends and family. Thank you so much Yagyu! You never fail to please!  P.s ask about the coupons! On Tuesdays they give a great deal for a free appetizer with a number of visits than any other days!"}
{"text":"Still my favorite place for original spicy miso ramen  & customer service is still very friendly and awesome!"}
{"text":"Miso Ramen ($8.95) was the only food I had here. i am a big fan of Japanese ramen. This miso ramen was the worst one I had in my life. The broth was too light and the noodle was too over cooked with zero firmness. Their menu is disorganized. They need a lot of improvement. I will not come back."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for authentic ramen. You can get extra noodles for a $1.00 or any ingredients are available. Their Kirin beers are near frozen!"}
{"text":"This place remind me of typical ramen shop in downtown Tokyo where I used to live. You can order donburi, curry rice if you don't feel like eating ramen. Most of the food here taste pretty good. This is the place to go if you want to eat decent food for decent price."}
{"text":"Come starving and leave without being able to finish your ramen. Everything was perfect. I ordered the Champon Ramen. I no longer have any other reason to live besides Yagyu Ramen."}
{"text":"We wanted to try a different ramen place than Monta, but the ramen was just ok here.  Nothing really special unfortunately.  Service was fine."}
{"text":"This was a Japanese BBQ until it changed to ramen place which is good too.  They have the frozen beer.  I meant very cold beer.  Service is phenomenon.  Food is good.  In china town there is not much to choose from.  I like quality.  This was very good quality Japanese cook BBQ place then it turned into very good ramen place."}
{"text":"Sweet owners!  I got the beef bowl a little on the sweet side with lots of onions and the Kakiage Don mmmm... Japanese omelette with pieces of shrimp tempura all in a miso broth with ramen so hangryyy I ate for two bwahah ;) I would def come back and  eat here some time."}
{"text":"This place is just meh. These are the words that many reviewers, as well as I, have chosen to describe Yagyu Ramen.   It wasn't one particular order that left me with a bad taste in my mouth, nor was it any order at all. It also wasn't the service for the day, as I didn't necessarily see any problems with my waitress (aside from the fact that it seemed like she was hurrying me to finish my meal). It was just all average, I guess.   My order consisted of my usual go-to miso ramen w/ boiled egg and butter, an iced tea, and a free check-in edamame. My S/O ordered similarly to mine, except he changed his bowl to the Tenshin Ramen.   I guess the broth didn't quite suit to my tastes. While some may not like their ramen oversalted, I do not like my broth under salted, as the point of a miso ramen is to be higher in sodium than other broths. I had to add quite a bit of soy sauce and chili spice to get a flavor that met my match. Of course, it may just be my particular tastes that was in the minority, but my S/O told me that his broth was also quite boring.   The takoyaki wasn't as flavorful as I hoped, but the octopus inside was chewy!  While eating, I felt rushed by the waitress there. She tried taking away my bowl, thinking I was done, when I still wanted to finish the rest of the broth. She did the same thing when I wanted to look at the menu again while she thought I was ready to pay.  :/  Don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and cheaper than most restaurant around here. I order beef bowl and they have more than i expected, it also come with salad and miso soup."}
{"text":"Formerly a Japanese BBQ spot, yagyu has completely renovated into a ramen restaurant.  Great selection of ramen as well as other dishes including the curry and stir fried dishes.  I used to get the beef bowl when it was special priced, an excellent deal in my opinion.  Usually get the gyoza which is consistent.  My favs include the tempura udon, miso yasai ramen and gyoza.  Menu can be confusing as the pictures don't clearly show what is in the dishes or say what's in them.  That's my only knock for this place."}
{"text":"Very casual and good prices for the portions and quality. I've only had their ramen here but they had pretty good deals going for their sushi as well. I had the charshu ramen which was flavorful and the toppings to noodle ratio was just right. I would come back to try their other ramen selection as well."}
{"text":"If you're looking to get away from the Las Vegas Strip for a place that is fast and affordable, this is the place.  This ramen house is located less than 2 miles from the Strip, down the street from the Palazzo / Wynn hotel off Spring Mountain in an extremely busy Asian strip mall.   We arrived a little after 6:30 PM on a Monday evening. There were a few tables occupied, and we were seated in a booth in the front. If you check in on yelp, you can get an free appetizer side of yakisoba. It's a tiny little plate, but hey, it's free!  The menu isn't just ramen, but has a little bit of everything, from other noodles like udon adn yakisoba, to rice bowls, to curry, to grilled items like fish or chicken.   Since their business name says Ramen, I decided to stick with cha siu (roast pork) Ramen as my choice, which came with a 1/2 egg, bamboo shoots, nori, and I added corn and bean sprouts to my order. I was given 4 generous slices of pork. Karen even commented that the slices were thicker than the usual places we go to.  I read mix comments about the broth, and I personally felt it was fine. It was not extremely salty, which I was thankful for as I didn't feel like drinking water all night. It tasted like it was chicken / pork stock.    Karen had the shoyu Ramen, which came with two slices of pork, bamboo shoots and an egg. Stephen didn't feel like noodles, and did not know what to get, so I suggested for him to get the beef bowl. It was a very generous bowl and the meat was marinated just right. Not too sweet, and it look like they use sukiyaki style beef. The beef bowl also came with salad and a bowl of miso soup.   Overall a very inexpensive dinner for three people, less than $30. Aside from the terrible parking, I would recommend this place if you're looking for cheap eats away from the Las Vegas strip. If you find a parking spot, grab it. Customers don't know how to navigate around this congested strip mall, and will do anything for a parking spot, including driving the wrong way."}
{"text":"Food 5/5 Customer service 4/5  I love the food here. We ordered a miso ramen and shoyu ramen, as well as a gyoza just to compare to other ramen places. Their gyoza is housemade, and tastes like it. Absolutely delicious. For the miso ramen, the serving size is a little bit bigger than other ramen places, honestly not the best tasting ramen I've had, but it's still pretty good.  The servers are nice. Only complaint is I see them talking to each other most of the time instead of customers. When we were here it was slow so it's not too big of a deal.  Good place, I'd rate it a 4.5 star place, but since I like this place I'll give it 5. They might need better pictures on their menus though!"}
{"text":"I'm so sad to report this restaurant is closed. We were excited to come for dinner but were greeted with locked doors. Looking inside things bare. I tried calling the number and got the message saying the number I dialed is incorrect."}
{"text":"This place is no substitute for Monta/Sora/Etc. Ramen. Their broth is not from bone. But for other cheap and nice Japanese style food, it is a good place to go for lunch!"}
{"text":"I had mabo ramen and it didn't taste well to be honest. I've had better ramen elsewhere."}
{"text":"I swear the best ramen to me.  portions are good.  quiet and a little hard to find.  I  brought my girlfriend and she loves it there during night time.  They have a frequent eats card so don't be afraid to ask."}
{"text":"Ramen was so-so! The menus on the wall compared to the menu in the restaurant were a little difficult to read. The service was super great, but the flavor in the ramen was lacking. The egg that came in the Britt wasn't soaked like normal which was odd to me. This is the third ramen place I've tried in a few weeks and was pretty basic."}
{"text":"The service was prompt... I could barely hear the server or understand what she said when repeating our order... She was so timid. Anyhow, we ordered tempura ramen, shoyu ramen, gyoza, and taki yako. The taki yako the first one I ate it was cold inside half way cook. Gyoza was good but no special sauce that came along with it. It wasn't good with just plain soy sauce. The tempura ramen and shoyu ramen was good. I was looking for a different taste that will distinguish and set aside the differences between Monta and/or Sora with this place. But the quality in the soup and ingredients at Monta are much better. At least we tried but won't come again..."}
{"text":"A nice and small place that wouldn't wait too long.  However, the don was smaller than I expected. I would like it better if chicken was cooked more well. Not bad generally."}
