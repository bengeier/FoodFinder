{"text":"Horrible service, most of the food either was not available or did not come, same food came only in half the quantities as ordered. It wasn't even busy, 3/4 of the place was empty.    It's hard to find an AYCE restaurant worse than this in Toronto.  We stayed at this place for 2 hours, and came out HUNGRY and ANGRY, enuf said!  - drinks took 30mins to get served.  - \"ran out of miso soup\"!?!? - \"ran out of rice to make sushi\" !?!?!?"}
{"text":"It's 19.99 for dinner AYCE, add $2 if going on Sat or Sunday evening.  Tack on 10% surcharge then 13% tax and the final bill comes to $27.05.  No problem so far, I am the kind that would consider the value for the money and not just the price.  I've heard this restaurant on the chinese radio 1430AM and seen positive reviews on other sites so I decided to give this a try (well after trying to go to Tenichi at 7PM sunday, no luck).  This place was half full and did not look especially busy on Sunday night.  So I start with some sashimi like salmon and hokkigai and guess what?  The slices are TINY!  Just like some other reviews elsewhere mentioned.  Well, no problem I thought, if the portions or size are small I can always order more right?  Some of the hokkigai looks like it's been sitting around for a while and the white meat inside has turned somewhat brown and dry.  OK OK so I eat the good ones and leave the dried out ones alone.  Okay, maybe the other stuff will be better....  Nope.  Next comes the soft shell crab roll, which is a special item only for dinner.  The seaweed is softer than kleenex and looks like it's been wrapped a half hour ago and sitting somewhere.  If you look at the roll with the ingredients facing you, you will see 3 sticks of cucumber (which was half the radius of the roll) and a slim morsel of soft crab.  Frankly speaking I think they could have stuffed it with imitation crabstick because I did not taste or feel any crab.  The tobiko and spicy salmon gunkan maki I ordered did not fare any better, it was as if it was premade and sitting somewhere for the last half hour.  Next came the fried capelin fishies which were freshly fried and so that was good, but it did not make me any happier than I was.  Lastly the chawan mushi (steamed egg) came and that was the deal killer!  It came in a teacup ( which is not a problem) and had a piece of imitation crab on top.  The top of the egg also looked a little bit browned and dried out (freshly steamed chawanmushi does NOT look like that.  When I reached for the cup......   It was room temperature!  Nooooo...  not warm, lukewarm, but room temperature!!!   By then that was it I said, and called for the bill.  The lady who was not in uniform (maybe the boss?) came and asked if I didn't want to have some dessert and all I could do was feebly wave my hand.  At this point I have only sat down for about 15 minutes.  When she came by with the bill I told her i had some comments for her and told her about the chawan mushi.  I said that if they can't be bothered to re steam the chawan then at the very least microwave it or something.  I am very sorry but Hyakka does not serve food that I would go for even if it was $5 dinner AYCE.  I would be more satisfied with a 2 item box from T&T.  Tomato sushi at metro square quality has gone down compared to when it first opened in 2008 but even Tomato sushi has this place beat for $10 less dinner time."}
{"text":"First impressions: messy and kinda dirty. No one was at the front to greet us- i saw couple workers glancing at us, but they just kind of ignored us.  Finally, one of the workers came and sat us down.  The tables around us were uncleared and there were food mess everywhere.  It wasn't even busy.   Anways, we sat down and ordered. Butter fish and salmon sashimi cuts were a pretty good size--they didn't go stingy, so that's good.  The chicken and beef skeweres were pretty good, same as the beef steak teriyaki. I must say they got pretty good beef.  Their handrolls need more work. They really need to roll properly.  Chicken teriyaki was kinda ...raw...  i dun think chicken teriyaki is supposed to be ...raw.... The service was shitty. They included the 10% service fee in the bill. I can see why."}
{"text":"NOT CLOSED, same people, same foof, just now under a new name - Matsuda :-) And it's still the best of the AYCA sushi joints!  For a lunch of AYCE sushi and lots of other dishes, this place rocks. Ignore the whiners who've complained, they obviously have some personal motivation to slam the place.  I've tried every place in the north/east end, and this place  is as good as any, and MUCH better than MduJapan, Makimono, etc. Much wider selection of dishes, excellent chicken and beef skewers, golden shrimp, teppanyaki garlic sirloin, etc. and it's a large, attractive, clean place, unlike many. Yes Sushi on 7, I'm looking at you!  Listen, the sushi isn't Kaji quality, but its fresh and solid for an AYCE place.  I've never been disappointed - my go-to AYCE at lunch."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and each time has been a different experience. Dinner price is $23.99 and Lunch price is $12.99.   For the lunch price, you can't really go wrong with AYCE since there are many choices on the menu that are pretty good. However during lunch specials the food is not as good as during the dinner special. Why? no clue. maybe different chef, maybe cheaper ingredients. I wouldn't recommend the sashimi here, as its always been pretty less than average quality and sometimes a bit frozen. wtf frozen? yah like orange ice in the middle.  however i am a big fan of their short ribs and chicken skewers (though one time they ran out of the chicken skewers...) the sushi is not bad at all, again depending on the time of day, and also depending on how busy they are.  the ambience is nice, tables are pretty big, they serve white tea instead of green tea which i love, and they have amazing iced tea - the real iced tea - which i find is pretty hard to find these days.  Check out lunch at this place, for $12.99 there's a lot to try on the menu so you can't go wrong. I find its hit or miss every time i go though so keep your fingers crossed.  PS- this place serves halal food"}
{"text":"This place has got to be the WORSE AYCE Japanese buffet on earth!! I came here when they first opened back in 2007 and it was good! Nowadays, I rather be eating lucky charms cereal than to go here. Came here on a Sunday night with a few friends since it was the closest AYCE. No one had anything good to say about this place.   The place wasn't even busy yet the service was horrible. They only had like 2 waiters in the whole place running around like headless chickens. We ordered ice tea to drink and that alone took 20min to come. When we finally got the pitcher of ice tea... it tasted like crap. It honestly tasted like water mixed with brown sugar so we ordered coke, which by the way my friend went up to the bar counter to get it himself seeing how it took so bloody long!   Food was garbage. Sashimi was half frozen, seaweed for the sushi was so moist... I can clean my hands with them, shrimp tempura was PACKED with batter that I couldn't even find the shrimp... maybe cause there wasn't even a shrimp in there to begin with!! Almost half the food we ordered didn't even come BUT they did bring food we didn't order, which we took anyways seeing how it took 10min for each dish to arrive. When food did arrived, we celebrated and yelled out \"Yeeeaah\"... the waiter even did it with us too.   Totally not worth the money to come here. Me and my friends actually wanted to dine and dash at this place. We didn't even leave full. This place has set the standards for a horrible restaurant. Their washroom was kinda nice though :\"}
{"text":"**** CLOSED *****  Another AYCE Japanese restaurant. This one is at the same plaza as T & T at Scarborough.  Food is comparable to other restaurant in the area.   Offer the similar hand rolls, sushi nothing really outstanding.   My favourite cooked dish here is the Grilled Cod Fish, not available to most of the other AYCE I been too. Most of their cooked dishes are better than quite a few of the AYCE.  For desserts they do offer mango pudding, Tiramisu and different kind of ice creams.  They are always short of wait staff during lunch hour. So don't go there for lunch if you are in a rush. And make sure you order everything you want when you do you first order, if not you will wait a long time for your food to come.  Please don't come here for dinner when it is public holiday or Mother/Father Day. The food is not good  at all since they are not able to cook to order, instead precooked all the food and leave them on a warmer.  For lunch there is no discount. So you might as well pay with your credit card. For dinner 10% off if you pay with cash.  They accept VISA and Mastercard.  P.S. They added 10% service charges on the bill already, so make sure you don't double tip them!"}
