{"text":"As good as it gets. I've never had mole this good. Ever. 

The Tamal Oaxacaeno is absurd. The Tlayudas are unreal. 

Someone pinch me, I'm dreaming. 

Next time someone tries to tell you that San Diego has better Mexican food than Phoenix, remind them that La 15 y Salsas exists, and end the argument. 

As good a meal as you'll ever eat."}
{"text":"This authentic Oaxacan food is amazing. The Enmoladas and Tlayudas will blow your mind. Place is clean and prices are reasonable not to mention they have good customer service. First time here and will definitely return"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix area.  I go there for lunch at least twice a week and the staff is always friendly and the food is consistently outstanding.  I love good Oaxacan food and this is absolutely excellent.  I have never had a meal that was less than awesome and I've sampled quite a lot of the menu."}
{"text":"Brought the family for an authentic Mexican lunch. This is a mom & pop hole in the wall type restaurant (which we love). Upon entering we were greeted by friendly faces and asked to seat ourselves. We were immediately served house made chips and the most delicious salsa. My 3 yr old daughter had the Sopa de fideo w/pollo, my 3 boys had the quesadilla w/rice. Husband had 2 tacos de carne asada & 2 tacos de cabeza and I had the Chile relleno w/rice, beans & side salad. Everything was delicious! Atmosphere was inviting and will definitely go back for more next time we're in town."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! I found the food incredible and the service delightful. They're salsas are beyond great"}
{"text":"I have had one lunch here, but I was so impressed that I want to give a supporting review right away so that they stay in business.

It is in a nondescript strip mall in Sunnyslope.  I probably wouldn't have tried it except for some good reviews I read.  Inside, it is much nicer than I had expected, although more authentic, casual Mexican than anything upscale.

I went here specifically for the mole negro, one of my favorite dishes.  I got the one with three enchiladas, stuffed with chicken, smothered in mole. I believe it's called enmolado.   Very generous amount of mole, filling the plate, double the amount of mole I have ever gotten in any other restaurant.  It was delicious, filled with generous chicken, overflowing with mole negro sauce.  The owner/proprietor came out to see how I liked it and brought me a free serving of smooth guacamole.  Her son came out later with a free agua fresca drink made from some tropical fruit I don't know.  They just want to be friendly and to have you like their restaurant and food.  This is definitely a small, neighborhood,  mom & son-run authentic Mexican restaurant, specializing in Oaxacan cuisine, and I use the word \"cuisine\" deliberately.

Ordering at the counter is a bit challenging because there are a lot of dishes listed on the overhead board that you don't find in the usual Mexican restaurant, and the sweet woman who owns and runs the place has adequate but not too strong English.  The effort is well worth it, and they do have a printed menu available that you could just take to your table.

I was the only customer late in the day, so very quiet.  There was a tv on in the corner with a Spanish-language show, but so low that I wasn't really aware of it.

In addition to the very warm, friendly service and pleasant atmosphere, the menu lists a large number of Oaxacan dishes that are new to me.  This is not your typical Mexican restaurant; it is not your typical menu, although you will find some familiar items.  There is much to explore if your are a foodie, and based on my one experience, well worth it.  I would have the mole dishes every week, if I could.  I am returning there in two days for lunch and bringing two new converts to Oaxacan cuisine.  And I need to add that the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Amazing food. There's even a little pantry shelf in back to buy mole starter, Mexican chocolate, molcajetes, dried herbs... Can't wait to try their tacos and enchiladas. Holy mole"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, I d love to keep it to myself and not see it ever get crazy busy.  But I want to see these owners do great! These owners are committed to real authentic Mexican food and service.  This is what Mexican food should be!! I wish all Americanized Mexican restaurant would go out of business and we would go back to this.  Bravo La 15 y salsas!!"}
{"text":"Must. Love. Mole. Although the salsa bar was out of service the friday night we came the 3 kinds they provided with chips were all good one had a kick. We ordered tacos, empanadas, flautas & tostada all the items we ordered had mole on them which is an acquired taste. We wanted to try a variety of items so we could try different flavors but everything tasted the same. Which was just okay."}
{"text":"My favorite Cheese quesillo oaxacaqueño and they put tons of it on there tlayudas witch is a giant tosta I got the veggie one very crunchy love there black beans my wife had the mole negro witch was ok a little bitter I like red the best the tejate was good but need to be sweeter if you don't know what it is it's corn masa with coco sugar and some other stuff it is the drink of the gods there are very slow but this is something that you don't want to rush"}
{"text":"This seems be a family owned restaurant.  Service was a little slow since it was just two working, but the food was good.  We were treated well and the owner was very friendly. I had the mole negro with homemade corn tortillas.  It was very good."}
{"text":"This place moved a couple blocks east. Their big sign was still up in the original place but just go about a half mile down and you'll find it. Amazing food. Brought me back to my days in Oaxaca. Please go see them."}
{"text":"Nestled in a notsogreat neighborhood, there is this little gem. Hot coal grill going outside invites you in. Really quant, clean, adorable restaurant, with amazing food, with super reasonable prices. Quick service, fresh food, and superior quality. I will be eating here again in the near future"}
{"text":"Holy mole! La 15 is Oaxacan heaven. Food is generous and wonderful, Ricardo is helpful and friendly, and the horchata comes in a pitcher with a straw. \"This place is a keeper,\" exclaimed my lunch buddy. We eat around the valley at least weekly and seldom return to the same place twice, so this was high praise indeed, seconded by me. Can't wait to try more delicious dishes here."}
{"text":"Had an amazing lunch there with the wife. This is not sonoran mexican cuisine but a totally rich deep flavored authentic that takes serious skill and patience. The best mole of my life."}
{"text":"Someone owes me 12 salsas.  

We came to check out Las 15 salsas (minus 12) in Sunnyslope.  The place is fairly small with seats for about 25 or so.  Nothing fancy but clean enough.  The menu is pretty vast with everything from tacos to tortas to mole and menudo.  Everything sounds great on the menu.  As we pondered what to get we saw a lot of tluyudas coming out of the kitchen and they looked great.  We figured it must be good as about 7 of them were being handed out at different tables.  We ordered one for the table.  For those who don't know it is basically a massive cheese crisp on a huge baked hard shell tortilla and covered with beans, cheese, lettuce, pork, chorizo, and slices of steak.

We put our order in and waited for our food.  We had chips and salsas and they were excellent.  Fresh cooked chips and 3 pretty good salsas.  A creamy avacado salsa, a chunky red salsa, and a roasted tomatillo salsa.  As we ate and visited we ran out of chips.  We received more and waited and visited longer.  We then ran out of salsas and chips again.  We waited longer.  The staff seemed overwhelmed.  Tables weren't clean for the next customers and they were running back and forth from the kitchen to the front.  We waited some more.  And then some more.  It was almost an hour by the time we received our food.  Mind you, we only ordered a few tacos, a couple ceviche tostadas, and a tluyuda.  This wasn't a huge meal we are talking about here.  

The food finally came out.  It was all very simple.  Precooked store bought shrimps on the ceviche, store bought tortillas on the tacos, very plain and simple type food.  What took so long is beyond me.  I could have whipped this up in 15 minutes flat.  The tlayuda had a odd taste I could not put my finger on but I believe it was the shredded cheese on it.  It was off putting for all of us.  

We finished eating and waited and waited.  Finally after about 15-20 minutes I went up to the counter.  And stood there...waiting and waiting.

As we left my primo asked \"But I just don't understand...why is it called 15 salsa if they only give you three?\"  I replied \"Probably because by the time your food comes out you have had 15 refills.\"

Wont be back.  Don't recommend."}
{"text":"Well, a disappointment. Two of us had the traditional Oaxacan tortillas w chorizo and thought they were pretty bland and uninteresting. Maybe it's just not my favorite regional cuisine."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out and brought my wife and one of her friends. Usually go to these types of hole in the wall places by myself since they can be a little intimidating.

This restaurant is very easy to drive right past. The sign is a bit worn out and most of the buildings around here look very similar. Just look for the reddish and yellow two tone building on the south side and you should be fine.

Inside looks different than some of the photos from the past. The colors are now darker and it didn't feel as festive as before. They have both a sit down area for food and a small market that sells Oaxacan ingredients. Really wanted to pick up some salted chili lime Crickets from the case but I was getting that funny look from my wife.

We sat down and ordered some appetizers to share and enjoyed some complimentary Chips and Salsa. The menus we were given were the Spanish only version and a little tricky to interpret. Good thing we all had a year or more in school. More photos of the food would definitely make things easier.

Tamales covered in Mole Negro, something called Memelitas and what they call an Empanada show up at our table. The Tamales were interesting and different than what we have had before. Good flavors but a little on the bland side. The Memelitas were unusually tasty and had a nice licorice flavor of some sort.

What they called an Empanada turned out to be more of a Quesadilla stuffed with Oaxacan Cheese and some really delicious Steak Meat. The flavors were very good but we all thought we were getting more of an Empanada style which is typically a stuffed and deep fried dough. Lost in translation?

For the main entree we decided to share the Red Mole Chicken dish with Homemade Tortillas. It was pretty good and came with a scoop of rice on the side. The handmade tortillas were an excellent choice to soak up all the red mole sauce. Both my wife and her friend were teasing me to stop using the tortillas and just lick the plate.

Service was friendly and a little on the quiet side. She said she was a vegetarian and wasn't sure how to answer our questions about which meat group tasted better with which mole sauce. The best she could do is tell us what is the most popular with the other customers.

Going to round this place up a notch since they do offer a lot more than just Oaxacan Food. They also have a large assortment of the regular Mexican items such as Tacos, Burritos, Enchiladas and even a nice Breakfast menu.

Looking forward to coming back over here and trying out some different items. It's hard to judge a place on one visit and this place has a lot of potential. HOLY MOLE!

3.75 STARS"}
{"text":"Awesomesauce ... quite literally!  The test of a good Oaxacan restaurant is how good its mole negro is.  Mixing different kinds of chilies with chocolate and Mexican cinnamon is quite a culinary balancing act, and this place does it really well. The chicken which was blanketed by the rich mole negro oaxaqueño was juicy and tender, and thank goodness there were tortillas on the side to sop up every bit of the tasty mole. Definitely a place for many repeat visits."}
{"text":"Update: I have to change my comment about \"not the best food.\" I walked in this morning and ordered enmoladas (mole enchiladas) and they were delicious. Scraped the plate clean. Seriously like this place.  Only complaint is they have probably 10 hot drinks on their menu and were out of all but 2. Oh, and dont wait for a check.

This place does not have the best food in town. What it does have is food that always feels homemade like it just came out of a moms kitchen. The yellow mole has big chunks of potatoes and carrots, the chorizo is good and the dark mole is great to sop up with warm flour tortillas. The service has always been sweet, the place never crowded. I will keep going back."}
{"text":"La comida es excelente ya q es una comida típica regional q no existe en el valle, es un lugar único totalmente diferente y el servicio como es familiar proporcionado por los mismos miembros de la familia es único ."}
{"text":"I went back today after 2 years and the home made quality is still the same. Today I enjoyed Tlayuda de Mole - very authentic Oxacan dish and just can't wait to try their breakfast menu. Mole is definitely their specialty and everything tastes just like my moms food!"}
{"text":"Muy bueno!  Damn the salsa is hot though!  Deserts look really yummy, very moist cake, getting one to go.
update:  had the cake when we got home, it was fantastic!  Seriously pissed the wife off though when I questioned how much of it she was eating."}
{"text":"The food is Amazing! Everything we had was super fresh and very tasty. Their salsa trio is all good but the verde is my favorite. I got a cheese quesadilla which was very filling and came with guacamole and sour cream. My husband had the milanesa which he said was the best he has had EVER. On top of all that, the service was great and the restaurant itself was very clean and inviting. We will be back for seconds!"}
{"text":"I consider this into the heart. This is to me, one of the most important reviews I will do.  

They don't know how good they are. 

I guess I haven't talked about these guys sooner because I don't have the words to describe how good they are. 

You don't eat here, you Experience here. 

It's sad to me they don't have more reviews. More praise. 

You can waste money, go sit in a rotating bar in the center of Phoenix, and have waiters and servers dance around you and feign an air of class or pomp. 

But here, you can eat like kings. 

I talked with the Owner, just a really good down to earth guy. His wife is the magician of the kitchen, and talking with them, you see how humble they are. That this place was build with love and family. 

You can't pay enough money for that kinda food. 

So... I guess what I'm trying to say...

In the simplest terms with as few words possible: They are the best at what they do. 

(And they serve crickets here! Yessss!)"}
{"text":"Mole mole mole!!!!!

If mole is what you want this is the place. For starters I am NOT a fan of regular mole. My boyfriend loves it. Of course this menu had other options. While ordering the waiter suggested my boyfriend try the mole flavors. 

Amarillo \"yellow\" Mole - is amazing!!!  I took a little try of the samples that were brought over and realized wow!  I love yellow mole!!!  It lacks the chocolate tones and has more of a fresh taste. So yummy! 

For all you mole lovers out there - my boyfriend had the enmolades and he loved them. 

Fantastic food!  Fantastic service!  An adorable little spot."}
{"text":"This is very unassuming place serving close to authentic food. The drinks were good size. The food was fresh and very close to authentic. 

We will definitely be back for more"}
{"text":"This place is way too yummy! Super flavorful! We have tried just about everything on the menu and enjoyed it all. If you're looking for the flavors of most typical Mexican restaurants in the Valley, this probably won't be your kind of place. Runny black beans flavored with anise, firm shredded Oaxacan cheeses, spicy salsas, bold and unique moles (some more bitter and others sweeter), charred tlayudas, and even some household favorites of mine such as enfrijoladas and entomatadas. Our latest creation is french fries smothered in mole and topped with shredded queso oaxaca (not on the menu, but can be special ordered). Soooo addictive and great prices too! The only downside that I can possibly think of is that it can get a bit toasty inside, but definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING OAXACA  IN PHOENIX!

The only problem is if you don't know your Memelitas from your Enmoladas ordering is bit difficult but not impossible.

We walked in and they have a menu board with pictures I really didn't know what I wanted because I didn't know what many of the plates were. So before I had that deer look in the head lights for too long I said I'd like something chicken with mole and the woman behind the counter said oh you want Mole Negro Con Arroz and pointed to a sign. I said, yes thank you that sounds good.

My husband said, \"what would you recommend?\" She told him about Memelitas and Enmoladas. I think they were similar but one was topped with a dark bean sauce and the other is topped with the dark mole.

For beverages they offer mostly Mexican Beverages and a few sodas but nothing is sugar free and there wasn't iced tea.

We seat ourselves and and soon bunches of things arrive. We received HOT Fresh Made Corn tortillas, a trio of salsas , chips and our two entrees.

The salsas were UNLIKE any other salsas I had anywhere else. We received a tasty tomatillo, a refreshing creamy avocado and the most interesting salsa was the Chili de Arbol (it's a Mexican bird's beak chili)  that also was the most spicy , smokey but not too smokey unlike your normal smokey sauce and it almost was creamy.

I received a very carefully cooked seasoned chicken leg that was falling off the bone moist.  But the skin was a throw away as is was moist and melting off.  The Mole sauce that blanketed the chicken was  the most well balanced mole sauce I ever had and that's why that sauce was delicious. A bit spicy, not too much chocolate, all the spices and ingredients carefully blended so you couldn't tell them apart.  My rice was fluffy moist and fresh, it tasted like it was cooked in house made chicken stock.

I'm not really sure if my husband received the Memelitas or the Enmoladas but what he received were shredded white meat chicken and cheese in folded corn tortillas that was topped with the same dark mole sauce. He said the chicken was moist and good.

They sell some Oaxaca Goods in the restaurant.

Very very good 4.5 Stars"}
{"text":"Worth the stop to have a late lunch or dinner. I chose the combination plate with Red child pork chimichanga comes with rice and beans. Very good, huge portions. 
Another dinner was the carne asada dinner.  Excellent taste, very flavorful food. Not very expensive, well worth the money.  Very friendly staff. We weren't too sure about grasshopper empanada so they offered a sample. Pretty good looked and tasted like shredded beef jerky. A must try if in the area."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Medium sized Mexican Restaurant. 15+ tables inside and a patio with 7 tables. Spanish tile floors, bright colored walls, with an legit authentic feel. Wouldn't call it a hole in the wall. Patrons are mostly Spanish speakers. 

Food: Many Oaxacan style food favorites on the menu (tlayudas, moles etc) I went with the tlayudas (f you never had one, try one! basically a large toasted tortilla with bean paste/oaxacan cheese among other things) I had the tlayuda combination (3 meats: Tasajo, cecina, chorizo) which was quiet good. The Tepache (fermented pineapple juice) was good as well. All beverages come in a mini-pitcher!

Price/service: only two people working that day so service was a Little slow but not bad. Everyone is extremely friendly and explained the menu well. I spoke Spanish so couldn't tell you if they were English friendly or not but I imagine they would be. The price was great especially considering the enormous portions.

Overall: A great Oaxacan find if your tired of the same old Mexican food you usually find around Phoenix."}
{"text":"This wonderful business is closed FYI. I drove by twice and a message in Spanish says closed for good. Bummer!!!"}
{"text":"Traditional Oaxacan cuisine including: mole, quesillo and chapulines (grasshoppers) -- or, just get a burrito! ;)

I had the emoladas which is basically a rolled enchilada (I had chicken) in mole sauce. The mole sauce was not overtly spicy. It had a nice, rich chocolate flavor. The quality of the chicken (all white meat) was good. 

You order at the counter and they deliver the food to your table."}
{"text":"I was really glad to stumble upon a Oaxacan-style Mexican restaurant during my short visit in Phoenix. The food was good! I was impressed by their freshly made aguas frescas. I was a bit disappointed that my tlayuda didnt come with avocado and Oaxaca cheese, only queso fresco, but I'm still a fan! The staff are super friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Really cute place with good food! We had the tlayuda tradicionale and the coloraditos mole, so good!"}
{"text":"The definition of a Mom & Pop Hole in the Wall Restaurant...which are my favorites!
Super hearty Oaxacan meals that rival the best I've had in Mexico. 

The mole negros are tried and true, you'll enjoy the delicious meal and want to slump into a nap from the food coma for sure. 

Their busiest times are during lunch when the local workers stop in"}
{"text":"We love this local, delicious spot for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! The owners are the sweetest and always super accommodating. Plus we love supporting locally owned businesses"}
{"text":"Food is good and has variety. Service is really slow! They need someone in front of the house to attend to guest."}
{"text":"It took me 5 years to notice that there was a restaurant here, it was hidden in plain sight! Love it! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is great! If you're looking for some authentic    Oaxaca food this is the place. At first sight it's very tiny and lonely. You kinda wanna just turn away but once seeing the food... you fall in love. I have the black mole which was delicious and very filling. The only reason I gave this place a 4 out of 5 is because of the Agua de ochata. It was very flat in taste. Besides that, this is the best place I've been too."}
{"text":"What a disappointment--particularly after reading all the rave reviews here.

As my wife's family es de Oaxaca and we have traveled all throughout the State, our expectations were high.  I would give this place a \"B\" for concept, a \"C\" for effort, and a \"D\" for execution.

Service was almost nonexistent--we arrived at 10 AM on a Friday and were one of two couples in the restaurant.  I asked for a glass of water.  10 minutes later I had to go out to my car and retrieve my own water.  The waitress was in space somewhere.  Seemed oblivious to my situation when she finally brought the water 10 minutes later.

All the \"rich flavors\" touted here are the opinions of people who don't know any better.  Their chocolate de leche was merely leche with a hint of chocolate.  Tlayuda was a sad mimicry of the \"real deal\" and the aciento was overpoweringly salty.  The memelas looked authentic--but were flavorless.  Their mole was thickened chicken broth with only a hint of authentic flavor.  All throughout this bland meal our waitress was nowhere to be seen.  

Final damages were about $25 for two people.  We left as quickly as we could.  NEVER going back.  This may be a step up from Garcia's, but nothing more.  No truly Oaxaqueñan cooks would EVER proudly claim they work here.  Owners:  ustedes sí tienen mucho que mejorar con su comida y su servicio.  ¡Que decepción!"}
{"text":"Always great food when I come to eat here. I always get the Emoladas and an Agua de Fresa. I brought my boss when he was in town from DC and he loved it."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  Huge plates full of delicious , marvelous, authentic food!  The service is fast, friendly and descriptive!  The tortillas are fresh, thin and absolutely the best I've ever tasted!  This is the empanada with Cheese and Squash Blossoms!  Totally tasty!!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place thru a couple of articles. I came back twice in the same week after the first time of trying them. I love mole negro and this is the first place that I've been to that has different mole types. Just ordered a fiesta de moles. Can't wait to try them! The enmoladas were amazing the first time around so I don't foresee it being any different. Will make you wish you discovered mole earlier."}
{"text":"My favorite Oaxaca spot! Amazing chips n salsa as soon as you sit down and sooo much food!!! The price is so worth it. We even bought some salsa to take home!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Service was on point.
Brought my children and they were impressed too.   The drinks were huge.  We were greeted with a smile"}
{"text":"The food is outstanding! My husband got the caldo de mariscos (seafood stew) and it is ridiculously good. Super generous with fresh seafood. I got the enmoladas with chicken and I love the mole sauce. We definitely want to come back and try the other moles and many other items. It feels like someone's grandma is treating you like a VIP and making her best dishes. Far better than typical restaurant fare."}
{"text":"Great traditional flavor and fast and great service. This restaurant is a great spot to get a quick lunch or impress your friends for a truly traditional flavor from Mexico. 
My husband and I tried the flautas, pork empanadas and the carne Asada burrito. Also the mole sauce is extraordinary.
The only thing I will advice is that is not air condition. Well at least the time I was there."}
{"text":"Amazing quality and selection you can't find just anywhere. Try the tlayudas, the mole, and the mini-pitchers of flavored water. We love oaxacan food, and this is our favorite restaurante oaxaqueño in the Valley!"}
{"text":"Holy Mole, this place is a diamond in the rough. Talk about delicious Mole, delicious salsas and totally refreshing and delicious Aguas frescos. The neighborhood isn't the nicest but who cares when you're eating real authentic and extremely tasty Mexican food."}
{"text":"Convivial little place in Phoenix that transport you to Puebla, or Oaxaca. The mole is tasty, thick and has a very good earthy taste to it. The homemade corn tortillas were thin and flavorful. The chips and salsa they serve are done well and offer 3 distinct tastes. The flour tortillas are unlike anything I have ever tried. The aguas are delicious. You cannot go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Good food from southern Mexico.  It's not your uncle's Mexican food.  Order at the counter, and then table service.  Relaxed atmosphere, including outdoor seating --but on hard benches.  I've gotta say \"authentic,\" even though it was 40+ years ago that I was in Oaxaca.  A beer & wine license is \"coming soon.\""}
{"text":"Excelente comida oaxaqueña autentica! Sin palabras de lo sabroso que estuvo nuestra comida. Probamos el mole y la tlayuda combinada, excelente sazon. Muy buena el agua de fresa. Y ni se diga del servicio, excelente. Defintivamente regresaremos!"}
