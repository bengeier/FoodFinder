{"text":"My all time fave sushi place in town  Friendly staff! Great service as always. The place is always packed. My favorite is their calamari and mango roll. Will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I've tried other places, but I keep coming back to Kinjo.  Always great food and great service at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Seriously fellow yelpers!  Why oh why does this chain have such high ratings!?  This location in Dalhousie is huge and the decor looks like a PF Changs but with a ton more tables crammed into the space.  Service was ok, I get that some people come here for atmosphere and the free pocky (which I think is lame).  Also I'm not a fan of dinning and having half of the staff break out in song for birthdays and a terrible rendition of \"I just called to say I love you\".  No thanks!  On to the food, OMG over priced for mediocre sushi.  I can't believe Peter would let the portions get to the size they are now.  When he was running the original Sumo Lounge in Eau Claire, there's no way he would've served food like this.    Calgarians please stop paying $4 for 4 small pieces of sushi rolls! Really should be 6 pieces and not sliced so thin you can barely taste the contents of each roll.    Ring ring, I didn't call to say I love you, instead: To the left, to the left Everything you own in the box to the left.  PEACE OUT!"}
{"text":"I used to really like Kinjo.  I go here often but the last few visits I am starting to not like it so much.  I love the Kiss Kiss Dragon roll.  But the last three times I have been, they do not have the unagi.  They say its \"out of season\" and other various excuses and substitute it with other types of fish.  This is disappointing to me.  And the final top off was finding a disgusting hair in our roll.  We told the server, she took it away and brought us a new roll.  They still charged us for it.  Seems to be going downhill in my opinion.   Quality certainly isn't the same as it used to be."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service everytime- have been going for years- can get in and out quickly if needed, very accommodating even if place is busy. My kids have loved it- Peter makes them feel special - bit corny- but they love it. He has a great memory. Good fresh sushi made on the spot. We have even resorted to take out when we have a craving. One of my fav sushi spots in Calgary and I love sushi!!"}
{"text":"I love Kinjo! My parents introduced this place to me, and that's my go-to whenever I'm meeting my mom for sushi (Macleod location).  The service is fantastic (you can sit by the bar and just select off of the boat or order from the menu). The sushi is fresh and tasty. They always start you off with a little sample plate, and you leave with a box of Pocky."}
{"text":"Well it was on trip number ?? that I found out they have a new loyalty program - it's this new cell phone based thing called \"Stamp Me\" it's OK and after 3 trips I got a $20 buck gift card.  Great !  Pretty decent but on Saturday after dropping another $100 I got ANOTHER new reward, this time it was a box of \"extra special\" pocky sticks!  Really!?  I don't think a store cost 29 cent gift is gonna cut it guys and considering that it IS pretty expensive to go anywhere in town for Sushi it's kind of lame.   Maybe talk to mgmt and explain that money talks!  (grin)  But the food is great !"}
{"text":"I don't care what anyone says. I love this place and I love the staff. Listen all the staff stop to take a moment to celebrate a person who they don't even know. I think it's wonderful they take the time to add a flare to the dining experience. It may seem cheesey and tacky to some of you but it better than other places where you have to practically light something on fire to get their attention. That's just me though.  I've been coming to Kinjo for along time now. Every time I come the food is always excellent I love the atmosphere and the staff is friendly and work quickly. I swear I've never seen my order come out as fast as it did tonight. It almost magically appeared before us.   The female dragon, rainbow rolls, some tempura, I love a mix of everything and it was all very good. I took my friends tonight here for dinner we normally do sushi on their side of the city but tonight I wanted to introduce them to Kinjo. Plus I LOVE pocky!   We all had a good time. We totally stayed way.. past close today and they didn't even rush us out. I feel awful though. I know what's like to work and have people not get the hint we were just enjoying ourselves and time ended up slipping past us. (Not the first time this has happened to me at dinner either.) I told the girl she should have kicked us out half an hour ago but she just laughed and I apologized for being a bad customer. They handle anything and everything very well."}
{"text":"Too expensive! We were 3 and we end up paying 100$. The quality of fish is good and if you eat a little the price would be good but not a good place if you are hungry! And they charge you 4.5$ for a small cup of green tea! And don't try the acvacado tempura, disgusting."}
{"text":"Kinjo used to be my favorite restaurant........went tonight for my birthday dinner. I told the guy when he came around with the Pocky sticks that it was my birthday but I didnt want the song, just the birthday Pocky. He winked at me and left, never to return with ANY Pocky.   My boyfriend ordered chicken fried rice, steak bites and I ordered the las vegas roll. I have had this roll before and it was good.......until I bit into a roll........YUCK. Tasted like fishy mayo.There are 5 pieces on this plate for $11.00 and I ate half of one piece. My boyfriends rice was so oily and his steak was so nasty. He hates confrontation so he asked me not to make a scene.  They came and asked if we wanted re-fills and we just asked for the bill. All the food was still siting on the table and they didn't acknowledge that. They brought us the bill, with a charge for this disgusting roll. While I was putting in my PIN number, the cow looked at me and said \"you don't like the rice\". NO, AND HOW ABOUT THIS NASTY ROLL BESIDE ME I DIDN'T EAT. MAYBE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT!  After payment was completed, she asked me if I wanted the roll wrapped up. I said no so she took it and walked away. She's lucky I even tipped her $2.00.   Never had such rude service before. Peter Kinjo is never there anymore to supervise so his restaurant is going for S%^&. I will also not give business to any of his establishments, Edo, Kinjo, Sakanna Grill and Sumo Lounge.   I will never recommend this restaurant to ANYONE again and will never return. I was a loyal customer, going once every couple weeks, spending $60.00 each time. I will also deter anyone from going here. Absolutely disgusting food and service!  There's $1,200 less each year you will get from me."}
{"text":"Worst sushi I had in calgary. Ordered some takeout and tuna colour was almost white when it should have been red-ish. There was something chewy in the salmon roll. Overall nasty sushi threw it in the garbage. Would rather pay a higher amount for fresh fish and eatable sushi"}
{"text":"Really liked it  -  first time at this location and what a difference from the south.  I have not been to the south in a few years as it got boring.  The northwest location is great!  Large, different variety of seating areas and an amazing visual menu.    Ordered several different items - all were great, though I found the sashimi much thicker slices than I prefer....regardless, definitely recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"So the last time I wrote a review about Kinjo Sushi was a while ago, however having visited the restaurant for the past year, here's an update if any of you are interested.  Kinjo has been known for many years now to be one of the top sushi restaurants to dine at where the original southwest location in Calgary always had both new and returning customers where business was and is still booming.  After the owner of Kinjo had decided on creating another location in Calgary, this time in the northwest quadrant of the city, it was probably one of the greatest business decisions as the restaurant is constantly packed.  Forewarning to diners, I recommend either dining at Kinjo either for lunch or for a really late dinner.  Unfortunately Kinjo does not take reservations, so regardless of how big or small the party is, I would say avoid the prime time 6 or 7 o'clock meal as the restaurant is just jammed packed...literally.  Unless you have a backup plan to dine elsewhere, wait times for tables can last up to 30 to 40 minutes.  Kinjo is also a popular place for birthdays - so if you're looking for a venue that isn't noisy, do be warned that Kinjo may not be your top choice.  Based on my experience of coming here (which is a lot) there usually is an average of 5 or more birthdays held where all the staff of Kinjo will join in the festivities by clapping, singing, and drum-beating for that special individual.  So as for forewarning, it can be a rather noisy meal for diners.  As a final note to my update, if you're craving for a beer but don't feel like spending a lot at the liquor store, definitely come to Kinjo.  For the northwest location only, Kinjo serves $3.50 pints of beer where you have the choice of Traditional, Alexander Keiths, Big Rock, Sapporo.  If you consider how much a beer is at a bar, its a damn good deal at Kinjo."}
{"text":"definitely one of my favourite sushi places in calgary! I enjoy the hot california roll and the magic steak is surprisingly good ... one thing that could improve this place is to not charge people for a refil of the small cup of soda they give ... but overall I'd recommend checkin this place out!"}
{"text":"It doesn't matter what time you go on a weekend, this place is always packed (lunch crowds during the week... forget about it!) ~ BUT for good reason!   Peter, the owner, has really created some magic with this little gem that we have been going to for years now. The conveyor boat system floats plates of sushi towards you as you wait with anticipation, lots of menu selections and speciality rolls on the regular menu and efficient staff scurrying around to keep everything moving along. It is also very entertaining to watch the sushi chef's create right in front of you in the center of the conveyor system.   We go to the North location as well at times and it has a totally different vibe. This one on Macleod is packed, crazy busy at all times with a sense of community as the one in the North is a sit down restaurant with an upscale decor and a much larger space.  My Hubs and I haven't seen Peter for a while at the Macleod location where everytime we were there he made my Hubs show him all his tattoos then Peter would sing \"Maria\" to him. Miss that!"}
{"text":"My family and I visit Kinjo Sushi several times a year, and we are never disappointed.  We always sit at the floating sushi bar, where the selection is much better than the other good sushi bars in the area. The staff all shout \"irrashai\" as customers enter; it means \"welcome\", and is a nice touch.  You might find that the owner chooses to sing to you or threaten you with his sword to be faithful to your wife or husband. I could do without that, to be honest.  It's not a cheap place to eat, but sushi rarely is cheap.  I recommend you try this place."}
{"text":"Just when I was beginning to lose faith in Calgary sushi places, I found KINJO!  Wow, wow, WOW! Service was exceptional... From the person who greeted us, the servers, and the cool guys who treat you to Pockey!  One thing I noticed is that everyone paid attention and spoke to our daughter. They brought out a plate of fruit that included an orange sculpted into a face.  Such simple things that add up to an awesome experience.   Loved the separate vegetarian one page menu, as we usually have to sift through sushi menus to find what we can eat.   Food was fast, fresh and delicious!   You can bet we will be back. Don't know why it took us so long to try Kinjo. Other NW Calgary sushi places will really have to step up their game to compete!"}
{"text":"A rare Calgary Sushi-ya with the sushi conveyor boats. We like it. Especially the volcano rolls. They are sushi crack. Don't forget the pocky!"}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, and simple. Plus, it comes with a free sample of four pieces."}
{"text":"Generally, I don't like routine or going to the same restaurant many times except for Kinjo. I crave their food and every time I try a new dish, I love it. I also love the way Kinjo's staff sing for people's birthdays. Whenever I want to celebrate anyone's birthday, Kinjo is my first choice"}
{"text":"Quality at the Macleod store has gone downhill. I went there a while back with a friend and the service was terrible despite it not being busy. So I vowed never to dine in the restaurant again but ordered take out instead.  My latest takeout order from the Macleod was just plain disappointing. The rice was not cooked properly and the sushi rolls were poorly wrapped. I ordered the Maki combo, the seaweed was ripped and didn't cover the entire roll. I won't ever be ordering from this location again."}
{"text":"I went to Kinjo based on all the awesome reviews on Yelp, the added bonus being it's close to home. When we walked in, it took about 2 minutes before we were noticed and given a table.  It was an hour before they closed, which i thought was plenty of time to show up and have a decent meal.  We had our order taken quickly, and when our food came, the server slid the food to us onto the bar, Our soy sauce was taken before we were done the meal, and the kicker was that we weren't even given the famed Pocky sticks when we were done. The sushi itself was decent, I'll give it that.  It would have been nice to finish off our meal without hearing the kitchen staff, gathered in one corner, yelling and eating before all the customers were gone, and having chairs stacked all around us by the remaining servers."}
{"text":"Good sushi and great service. If there's a line up, it moves very quickly and the service is always very prompt in the food comes fast. They are also great with kids. We also like to sushi boats float around the sushi bar."}
{"text":"this is my favorite sushi place! their spicy salmon cone is the bomb!!! i will always come back here. you should try to see what im talkin about"}
{"text":"This place is pretty much 'the fast food of Sushi', not just for the speed but for the cookie cutter/assembly line production of the plates. Even though it's fast food Sushi, food use to be half decent. Now, it's just not even worth it. We come quite often in the past, but the last 3 visits has just been really bad. They never have Toro anymore, always saying they are sold out. They've been sold out for 2 months now. One of my favorites is Akira (salmon roe), the roe portions are just a thin layer and just hiding more rice. Today, we got an order of tempura shrimp that was just not edible. Just totally under cooked. All other dishes were just not tasting fresh. For a large busy restaurant, they can't even keep the food fresh. As i said, we used to go quite often, but after the last 3 attempts, we are seriously not going back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food and really good service.  A little more upscale than the south side location. Worth a try for the skeptical first time sushi eater.  Start simple like a California roll or the the Salmon sushi. The textures and flavours are excellent."}
{"text":"Visiting from Toronto, first restaurant we found on Yelp, very fast paced and fun environment, we truly enjoyed our dinner."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I frequent Kinjo because it's decent sushi for a good price. Normally we go to the Millrise or MacLeod Trail location but we decided to try the Dalhousie Kinjo as we were seeing a movie nearby. As other people have mentioned, this location is large and VERY busy. No big deal, we wait five minutes and get a table. We order some drinks, two alcoholic drinks and two Pepsi's. The pop comes and is super flat, so we ask whether we can send it back and get something else instead. The manager comes back to us and tells us that the pop machine is fine and that no, we cannot send our Pepsi's back, but we are welcome to pay for something else. Keep in mind that we aren't asking to send booze back, or any food. It's literally SODA, which probably costs the restaurant 8 cents a glass. The principle of being told that I'm wrong about the way my drink tastes made both my girlfriend and I pretty annoyed. The food was fine, the tempura we ordered was super soggy, like it had been sitting out for a while, but we didn't dare ask for a replacement after the pop ordeal. Tried to contact Kinjo through their website, but there is no option to do this.  tl;dl - Hope that your food tastes good, cause you're def not getting a replacement at this place."}
{"text":"If you are hungry for sushi and want to eat it quickly, this is the place for you.  The service has always been great, the staff are very friendly. The birthday singing must be toned down though, it is just awful and the frequency is far to high.   The quality of the food is equal to what you would get at a mall.  This is not a restaurant for those who love sushi, or appreciate the taste and delicate flavour. This is a restaurant for those who like the idea of sushi and douse their servings in soy sauce and wasabi.  This is a restaurant for those who want to eat sushi as an alternative to another restaurant."}
{"text":"No stars at all...extremely disappointed with they way I was just treated. Tried to order online and their affiliation with skip the dishes caused for a non order and us leaving with no food! Confirmed by the girl at the front desk that this is a norm with skip the dishes not good enough and when they tried to take our order I kindly asked if I could still have my $5 discount and they point blanked refused and said no they can't honor it as it is a skip the dishes promo (understanably) but hey,  they new this was our very first time wanting to enjoy their food,  and now what was supposed to be a 20 min before supper turned out to an hour and we still left with nothing. Not even a sorry for any inconvenience. So we sure will not be back ever! Not that hard up for kinjo. And for the girl staring me down to see if that would get me to submit...didn't work...I work in customer service...you sure do not treat a customer this way...I was honest and all I wanted was my order not any excuses. Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"I love the food here and the staff is great! The whole team greet you when you come in which is always nice. Service is also quick. I hope they open more locations soon."}
{"text":"I have been going here for my birthday for the past three years without fail! This place not only makes tasty sushi it makes going to a sushi restaurant so much fun! I think the fruit sculptures for the kids and the gifting of pocky sticks at the end of your meal is such a good idea, not to mention all the staff greet you as you enter. Definitely worth a try if you have not as yet."}
{"text":"Let's get the bad out of the way first. This restaurant has an extremely patronizing attitude towards women, and outright contempt for the men they're with. So I was there with my mom and my sister. Waiter comes out and offers them a Pocky dessert. (some kind of bread stick dipped in sugar cream) But only to women. \"You have to either be a beautiful woman or be cute.\" He looks at my sister and says, \"Is that your sister? How come she's so beautiful and you're ugly? Is that another sister? (looking at my mom) They both get a snack, you get the bill. Everybody happy\" Umm.... ya. There's tasteful joking and then there's just awkward crassness, and this was the latter.  The sushi menu is very focused on heavily sweetened, fruity sushi, with lots of deep fried tempura as fillings. The restaurant is a bit of a zoo at dinnertime, the serving staff plop down your food, check it off the ticket at your table and scamper away. The food is a nice treat if you occasionally have sushi, but if you're a sushi buff, the relatively small variety of nigiri and sashimi will have you looking elsewhere.   Rolls look great in the pictures but in reality they're thrown together so quickly during the dinnertime rush that there's only a slight resemblance to the overexposed glossy photos you see in the menu.  Don't order the seaweed salad thinking it's like the seaweed salad elsewhere. It's served in a big bowl making you think you just got an awesome deal, but then you discover it's just a thin bed of wakame on top of half a head of romaine lettuce with half a cup of thousand island dressing on the side. A rip-off for $6.  In any event, the whole experience was ruined for me by the very tacky waiter (and the annoying tendency for the whole staff to run out of the kitchen banging on metal pots in awkward celebration of yet another patron's birthday). Too bad, because I wanted to like this place - one of closer sushi places to the parents house."}
{"text":"Great! I went there  myself today because i wanna eat eel which i saw the attractive picture in yelp.I ordered three meals, and they all looked amazing. I 'v upload the picture."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant.  Excellent, authentic Japanese food, including both sushi and izakaya, at reasonable prices.  The next time I am in Calgary I will definitely return to Kinjo!"}
{"text":"Delivery took 1h15 min. Ordered via skipthedishes.ca. I ordered the sushi platter, unagi roll, cucumber roll and avocado tempura. It was pretty good."}
{"text":"I have not had a bad experience at Kinjo, they are always so friendly and the food is good! I love the moving sushi bar so you can just grab whatever you want, and the prices are reasonable. You can fill up for $15! If you want to pick from the moving sushi bar rather than order from the menu, go at supper time. The wait time is sometimes around 20-30 minutes at supper, but it's worth it. There's something for everyone at Kinjo, not just sushi but other Asian hot dishes."}
{"text":"Good food, great service and very family friendly. There's something for everyone on their tapas menu. Kids got complimentary cookies and fruit plate. Great weekend family outing."}
{"text":"First time there was last night, we were seated quickly & offered apps immediately. The server explained rolls to us & was very attentive. One roll was late coming out big no big deal. We chatted while we waited & got complimentary cookies - neat idea! We will go back."}
{"text":"Came here after going to Chinook Mall and was in the mood for sushi. Decided to try Kinjo Sushi and Grill which was just down the street. Was very delighted to see the moving boats where you can just pick the sushi right off the rotating boats. The sushi was fresh, delicious and very well priced ranging from $3.50 - $6 per dish. You can also order many other dished off the menu.   The service was simply amazing. We got a free sushi sampler as soon as we sat down, got another one during the dinner, and got free boxes of Pocky after the server played a few games with us where he got us to sing and play along. They would also go around singing songs for people's birthdays, anniversarys and some just to kids. It was very entertaining.   I'm picky with my sushi as I've had sushi all over Canada, and Asia including Japan. I'm still not impressed with the sushi in Calgary - but overall I think Kinjo Sushi and Grill is very good for Calgary and highly recommended. After this first visit I think I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So after a nerve-wracking drive through a blizzard, I realized, after my hands stopped shaking, that I was kind of hungry.  Or maybe I was just thrilled to be alive.  In any case, since this joint had been recommended by the local Yelpers, and since it turned out to be relatively close to the motel I was staying at, I decided to check it out.  After finally finding the place, I was shown to a table immediately, which probably had something to do with the fact that the staff seemed to feel sorry for me for dining alone. Then again, the waitress did mention that the crappy weather was affecting their business, as they were normally much, much busier, but I think she may have been trying not to hurt my feelings.  The ordering system caused me a little confusion, as I wasn't certain if I was supposed to fill out the sheet that was left on the table, or if the waitress was going to do it when she came back.  Alas, I was supposed to fill it out, as the waitress entered a mild state of panic when she saw that it was blank, and started doing the Japanese version of a disapproving \"tsk tsk\".  That part was kind of cool, though - it reminded me off all of the disapproving looks I received from my grandmother over the years.  If you've ever upset a Japanese lady, then you know the sound that  I'm talking about.   After placating the waitress and finally getting my order in, I sat back to enjoy my tea.  The food started arriving quickly (again, I think they felt sorry for me), and was exceptionally tasty.    I was a little surprised at how inexpensive the meal was - 3 dishes for less than $20.  Not bad at all."}
{"text":"Came here today as it was the closet sushi place. The place is very roomy and nice. They gave me 4 pieces of sample rolls which was a nice complement. I ordered two of their special roles, which to day the least we're extreme disappointments. They were extremely small and essentially had nothing but fried pieces of squid and fish in the middle of the maki. I would not order their special rolls. Without the samples I would have given this place a one star. Needless to say, this rating is based on food alone and I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"This is one of the places I go to when I crave sushi in Calgary.   Freshness of the fish=OK (probably one of the better ones in Calgary) Tempura is also OK  Rolls are good , you will recognize all the rolls on the menu.   Oncea again, if you want sushi in Calgary check this place out."}
{"text":"Price got jacket up... sushi not bad... but had better for the same price... definitely not my first option... inside looks nice though with friendly service."}
{"text":"The manager made my boyfriend say sweet things to me before giving us our complimentary Pokey for dessert. We also received complementary sushi. The food was delicious and to top it off, the staff was friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"Only the best sushi place in the city! They really make you feel welcome here and have the some of the best customer service I've ever seen in a restaurant. Definitely have to try it!"}
{"text":"fave sushi location so far here in Calgary! service is always prompt and friendly, fresh sushi and great appetizers good prices  love the pocky you get in the end hehe!"}
{"text":"My first time experiencing Kinjo Sushi was at this location. What an amazing impression...   First of all, the wait times are very reasonable. Sure there are a lot (and I mean a lot) of people waiting, but tables clear very fast as this place is HUGE!!   We got some complimentary sushi, 8 pieces to be exact, since we had a table of 6. So one plate of 4 for each side of the booth :) They were delicious!  We tried the kinjo roll, mango roll, and the chef's special midori roll. Very yummy rolls :) i enjoyed the smoky taste of the Kinjo roll, as well as the warm cream cheese in the midori roll. :) The avocado and mango combination for the mango roll was also divine!  Peter Kinjo came to our table and greeted us, he also made the boys say nice things to the girls at the table. The girls also got free Pocky after. He really makes an effort to chat with the table. :)   Staff are very welcoming, very humous, too! Our server was really fantastic, came to check up on us a lot, and I love how the waiters/waitresses when bringing food, they check it off on the list like a dim sum restaurant. Helps to keep track of the food they bring out so often!   The prices are soooo reasonable. I don't know if it's because they've just opened, but honestly the prices here are so much more inexpensive than the prices at other great sushi restaurants. You can definitely have a good meal here if you're on a budget of $20 :)  We also tried the green tea ice cream, it came with some Pocky sticks and whipped cream.   Overall, I would totally recommend this place :) Easily accessible, great food, great service, and Pocky!!!"}
{"text":"This place has a weird policy that customers cannot be seated at a table until their entire party has arrived, this proved to be frustrating when I took clients for lunch..... not to mention the food was very average and messy, the rolls are not very tightly rolled.   Expect your small table to be stacked with plates as each of the different colored plates is a different price, your plates are added up at the end of the meal to determine your bill amount even when ordering off the menu!  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time! The service and food are always consistent and the staff are friendly and upbeat. It's always busy, making for a lively atmosphere."}
{"text":"I drive 200 km to get to Calgary and I weep if I can't make time for this place."}
{"text":"Kinjo's sushi is like a spiritual orgasm. You'll try this stuff and you will literally experience the best sushi that Calgary has to offer. Another thing Kinjo has that most \"Sushi\" restaurants don't have is that the hospitality is very hands on. How many sushi restaurants give out \"free\" samples of their sushi?  If you want to break the ice with your new date, take them to Kinjo and have Peter Kinjo shove his gigantic knife in your face as you recite his love oath to your date. The only major flaw is that Kinjo isn't the cheapest sushi in town. However, it's still reasonable considering the quality and taste of the food. If you want \"The Famous Kevy Recommendation\", I would suggest the Ikura sushi with a Coke to drink. Very tasty."}
{"text":"Excellent service and awesome food! Great place to celebrate birthday parties. The servers will come over and sing for you and give some treats. Kids also get extra treats."}
{"text":"THEY ARE ADDING A LOCATION IN MILLRISE (this is my current neighbourhood and I'm over the moon excited!)"}
{"text":"I used to come to Kinjo quite often. The atmosphere was always fun and lively, service prompt and friendly. The sushi wasn't the best sushi I've ever had, but it was still tasty. Came in here for lunch today. Our server was meek, but polite. The food was not good. They used way too much rice for the rolls, the fish was not fresh, the spicy salmon roll was extremely salty. The tempura was really soggy, which was unpleasant. While most of our food came in a timely manner, I watched the chef yell 'Order Up' on our tempura. It then sat there for several minutes before anyone came to pick it up. There were 3 staff members sitting at the bar chatting and on their phones, yet they couldn't take a minute to bring us our tempura? That's why I wasn't surprised by its sogginess, and I should've sent it back, but I was in a hurry and I worried it would sit there again unattended. Btw, these staff members didn't get up once the entire time we were there. Big disappointment."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here. If you want to stay and have a long dinner, you can, if you want to be in and out in 40 minutes you can. They cater to whatever you need and the food is always quick. The atmosphere is great if you're not looking for something quiet as it can be noisy but the sushi is well worth it."}
{"text":"Fantastic place. Service is quick and staff are pleasant. Draught beers are $3.50(win). The kimchi salad and deep fried squid legs are a must. Place is always packed for dinner but worth the wait if there's a line."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, free pocky and sweet soy sauce.  Pretty Westernized sushi, good selection and sushi samples before you order!  This place is awesome possum and I want to come here every weekend!"}
{"text":"Oh, this is going to be fun!  I took the sushi class there! If you really want to know how much fun that was, and why your next corporate party (minus the boss, you will know later why) should be held here, bear with me and read on!  So... One day me and my ex decided to get into something together. Just so that we had something to show for trying to make it work in front of the divorce judge.  I love sushi so much, that I thought it would be wicked to know how to make it. Well, it really helps couples bonding - at home it takes about 3 hours to cook the rice...   So... Ready?  First five minutes were just plain fun. Putting those aprons on, getting to know other people in class (full every time!), rearranging the neat looking gadgets and peaking at those little white cups for sake...  Next five minutes it got even better. Peter, the owner, slowly began to make us all fall in love with his amazingly energizing personality.  Oh boy... Next five minutes were the beginning of something that later was a bit difficult to remember) Sake began to be poured... Endlessly. No, man, I mean - endlessly!   Fast Forward a bit - I do not remember when I had so much fun learning something new! We all made our own rolls and sushi and sashimi. We got to taste them and even got platters to take home! It was very entertaining to roll those first rolls. Then the staff together with Peter started to entertain us in many other ways - serenading the couples, cracking funny jokes and so on.  Sake was still being poured endlessly...   Everyone in class had so much fun and after a few hours we all felt like we knew each other forever!   There were fun contests too!  ONE SERIOUS ADVICE: Have a designated driver or call a cab! You will not want to drive after this class!  Excellent choice for a corporate party or a birthday. Could think would be a great idea for a stagette/stag. Million occasions where this class can be a real great idea to take 20 - 30 people to!  GREAT VENUE! GREAT STAFF! GREAT SERVICE!  P.S. When I came back there a while later for lunch, they recognized me and I got extra treats just because I took that class!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Been to two locations and always enjoyed it. Ordered take out for the first time tonight. Take out was disappointing. I got chicken fried rice and it was in a very small container, not even full. It was probably less than half the size of the bowl you get when you eat in. Not even close to worth the $5.50 price tag. I love kinjo and will come again, but I don't think I will ever get take out again :("}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant! The food is amazing and service is very fast. Lineups can be long around dinner but we've never had to wait for very long.  Food is served within minutes after ordering and the staff is very friendly. Awesome place!"}
{"text":"The food is good and reasonably priced, although there is better sushi out there. The food hits your table fast, sometimes too fast if you want to enjoy a meal and talk with friends. My other problem with the place is the loud birthday song they sing to people celebrating a birthday. Sometimes it seems like you are in a Chucky Cheese... not very fun, and sometimes downright irritating. This place would be great if they stopped the birthday song BS. That said, you cannot beat the value you get here for sushi. (just bring your earplugs)"}
{"text":"Well, unfortunately Yelp steered me wrong on this one.  To sum up my impression in 3 words: very poor quality.  I was already unsure about this place as soon as I walked in, so decided to stick with veg options, since I'm quite picky about seafood.  Got an avocado roll, which had firm, overly chewy nori.  Vegetable roll-cold, hard tempura inside (I think it was the asparagus that was hard).  Inari-just tasted off.  Tempura avocado-this was the best part of the meal, was pretty tasty.  Tempura asparagus-tasted awful and the bottom of the asparagus was so hard it was inedible.  My dining partner was also very unimpressed with the dishes he ordered.  Overall, this was the worst sushi I can remember eating, and I'm a bit shocked that it has such glowing reviews here."}
{"text":"Kinjo is great for sushi lovers who have kids.  My husband and I used to drive to Centre Street or Kensington to get our sushi fix, so we're over the moon to have discovered the Dalhousie Kinjo - only a five minute drive from our house.  We've tried a couple of the options in our area and have never been satisfied with the quality of food/ambiance.  A few notes on our experience:  - service was fast and friendly. - the place was spotless. very clean. - the food was delicious. - the ambiance was fun and lively (perfect for kids). - clean highchairs and booster seats available. - large diaper changing pad in women's bathroom. - open concept kitchen (nothing to hide). - the staff seemed very appreciative of all their customers. - they went out of their way to make our daughter feel special. - prices were very reasonable.  We are so happy to finally have a restaurant near our home that we want to be regulars in. Welcome to the NW, Kinjo!"}
{"text":"Favourite sushi place in Calgary! I also love the millrise location but we go to this one more often because of the sushi bar. The pocky guy is great! The sushi is out  of this world. Amazeballs! All of it! Minori roll is my favourite.   The millrise location is definitely more kid friendly and we only go to that one with our little one."}
{"text":"Since this location is in Dalhousie, it's generally full of families with little children, which I would usually find abhorrent and avoid, but the sushi at this restaurant is so delightful that I'm willing to brave the occasional sea of crying infants and harried parents. The rolls as a rule are inexpensive, tasty and are brought quickly, the Sapporos are always cheap and delicious, and the salmon sashimi could bring the pickiest of sushi nay-sayers to their knees. Sometimes I come here alone and only eat the sashimi with my eyes closed,  moaning only slightly, since the experience can only really be described as bliss that boarders on being sexual. I guess sashimi does kind of look sexual, doesn't it? Anyways, order the sashimi and ask to sit in the corner away from prying eyes. Oh yeah, they also give away free Pocky, I personally prefer the strawberry."}
{"text":"Yelpers, what is going on here?  I'm baffled by the rating this place is receiving.  Yes, its a fun environment (if you like loud), they give you free pocky (who doesn't like pocky), and the service is fantastic (very pleasant staff that are lightening fast).  But on that last point, I have to say it's part of the problem.    Our sashimi included tendons and scales, the rolls were of buffet caliber (you'll know what I mean if you've ever had rolls out of a buffet tray), and a few pieces of my tuna sashimi actually had a crunch to them (still frozen).  I understand why you might have to use frozen fish in the foothills of the Rockies, but if there was just a little more care in the preparation, the quality of the food would be a lot better (though I have little hope for those rolls).      I love good value, and the 3.50 pints of beer and some of the plates give the appearance of value from the menu, but I guarantee that if you've had good sushi before (i.e. Sushi-Bar Miki), you won't be satisfied.  Go somewhere smaller that focuses on quality; you'll probably end up paying the same price and be much content with what you ate by the end of your meal."}
{"text":"Went here for a business lunch on friday. Was exceptional and very value priced for my experience. Considering it was the lunch rush, it was busy but the waitress still gave us time and assistance.   Short review but I'll just say I will be returning."}
{"text":"Solid sushi, fun boats. Dinner theater for the masses.   Sushi is fresh and a nice variety of rolls and nigiri are available on the boats. Staff are friendly and attentive.   The complementary starter sushi plate is really nice when you arrive hangry.   Prices are decent, too - $35 for 5 plates and 3 specialty items is quite filling for two people."}
{"text":"I particularly loved going to Kinjo because they were the only restaurant I could find in Calgary serving brown rice sushi.  They are no longer serving brown rice :("}
{"text":"Truly a disappointment compared to the Dalhousie location. The size of the sushi we ordered were not only tiny, but you could tell it wasn't fresh. It looked like it was just slapped on the plate.   The service was terrible. We asked for extra Wasabi 3 times before it was brought to us and the girl didn't seem at all interested in apologizing for the delay either.   Everytime we come to Kinjo on Macleod, it's been a disappointment. It's time to stop giving them 3rd or 4th chances. DOUBLE THUMBS DOWN!!"}
{"text":"While Kinjo is not anywhere near the best sushi in Calgary I give it a 4 star.  Let me clarify why.  Kinjo is the Denny's of sushi. Fast, reasonably priced, consistent and leaves you full afterwards.  They won't win any awards for taste or dining experience but you will get good (not great) sushi. Service is extremely fast due to so many waitstaff milling about. Pints of beer are very reasonable priced.  A couple can eat sushi, a few other sides and have a drink for under $60 and leave very full.  I don't go to Kinjo for a dining experience that will tantalize my tastebuds. I go there for good food to end my hunger.   They get you in and out quickly (they don't rush you .. just the food comes very fast) and you leave satisfied."}
{"text":"We've ordered from Kinjo for home delivery many times in the past thru SkipTheDishes.  Usually it's very passable and fresh, not so tonight. The salmon, unagi (eel) and California rolls were okay, but the tuna (white only available - no Ahi) and the scallops were very very bad. Smelly, with an off-taste.  It's put us off from ever ordering from them again.  Yuck.  On the good side, it was quick with good delivery.  But come on guys, the food has to be fresh!!"}
{"text":"This is our favourite sushi restaurant in Calgary, just edging out Globefish.  The place literally buzzes.  You are given a little sampler plate of sushi the minute you are seated, Peter walks around waving his knife and making people smile, and NO ONE leaves the place without a box of Pocky.  The food is always fresh (definitely try the asparagus tempura) and prices reasonable.    And...one of the waitresses' name is Ting Ting.  For real.  You gotta go!"}
{"text":"Think of Kinjo like dinner theatre. It seems less about the food and more about the show. Apparently lots of people love this... I'm not one of them (and I seem to be in the minority here). Both times I've been there I've found the Kaiten style sushi to be sub-par. I guess, if the most common compliment people give a place is that you get free pocky or the staff are hi-lar-ious, then you have to wonder about the food."}
{"text":"I love my kinjo. Always sit at the bar, it's fun watching the cooks at work. Tried different items over time and i was always pleased. Bill can get pretty high though."}
{"text":"I love Kinjo, but apparently so does everyone else because the line up to eat here is INSANE!  Kinjo doesn't take reservations - so for our sushi loving group of 8 we've either done senior citizens' dinner at 4 PM or it's a \"2nd dinner\" at 8 PM to avoid our previous failed attempts to dine at regular eatin' time (we've waited an hour before!)  Complimentary sushi was brought out to us as we placed our drink and food orders - a nice touch! Even with our large group, all our food came out within 15 mins of ordering (both sushi and hot dishes). The servers came by frequently to clear our empty plates and fill drinks, and of course what our group calls \"POCKY TIME!\" came shortly after we finished eating.  We were in and out of here in 45 mins - a record for us and honestly it's for the best. That line up is because of people who sit and dawdle (and sometimes stare!) at the people waiting for a table - DUDE GET UP AND GET OUT ALREADY I AM H-ANGRY!!!  The food is always fresh here (I recommend the spicy crunch roll and the agedashi tofu), the servers are quick and are always smiling - and if you're lucky sometimes Peter Kinjo is around entertaining and that guy is a hoot lol"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I'm not really a food snob. I like eating, so as long as there is decent quality food and good atmosphere, I'm happy!   Kinjo certainly isn't where you go for gourmet food, but it's such a fun restaurant with great vibes. And the Pocky people make it even more fun! It's great for groups, and it's simple to order from the menu. The food quality is actually pretty good, as it was quite fresh for me (even going on a Sunday evening right before close), and the food was brought out promptly.   Of course, it's nothing crazy here, but it's clean, it's good food, it's consistent, and it's great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Cheap sushi eats. Decent tasting for Calgary. Quirky service to say the least. Easy to overreat!"}
{"text":"My first Kinjo experience was a few months ago at this location. Absolutely loved it! I've been back 5 or 6 times since. There's a ton of variety, and the food is great, volcano rolls are my absolute favorite. The service is out of the world, friendly, and funny! If you have room for dessert, the coconut ice cream is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Kinjo has the best sushi in the city hands down. Generous in proportion and prime in freshness. I have yet to find this quality of fish in a land locked area for the price charged. The staff is AMAZING and who doesn't love free Pocky (for the ladies and little ones). This location has sushi boats which is fun and helps peak your interest making you try new foods.   Kids also get a complimentary fruit plate that features an adorably carved orange in the shape of a monkey!!  It is always busy so come early!"}
{"text":"Great place! Enjoyable friendly atmosphere! Even once you enter the door, you're greeted by the entire staff.  Complimentary plate of sushi is brought once you are seated, a 'tester' or sample plate with 3-5 pieces, that I've always found delicious.  The sushi bar is great and anyone who has been there before has most likely met Peter the owner, who is always hilarious and sets a great mood for the meal."}
{"text":"I stopped in here with a friend for a Friday night sushi date. After a brief wait, we managed to get a seat at the sushi bar, and these seats are tight! You are literally brushing elbows with the rest of Calgary in this place. Which worked out okay for us, the people next to us were friendly enough and I didn't mind them throwing comments into our conversation randomly, it actually made it more interesting.  We chose to dine just off the boats, grabbing whatever caught our eye. Some items seem to go around for ever, whereas others were snared before they even made it to us. It seems that if you could plan your seating strategically, you would be able to sample most everything. Sadly, it doesn't work like that so I hope you like California rolls! ;)  I would say to pass on the nigiri and focus on the rolls. The fish options didn't look that great to me on the boats but I said to hell with it, and tried some anyway. I can't even remember all that I had, but I know I had some tamago, salmon and possibly prawn. I know I did not care for the fish much, I really don't like when there are ribbons of tough things that I have to gnaw on (do fishes have gristle?) - shudder. The guy dinning next to me (the chatty one) had a bone or some cartilage in his, not cool. The rolls were nothing to write home about either, these seem to be fairly easy to come by but are nothing more than very basic/simple rolls. If you want something more than that you would likely have to order off the menu.  I like the idea of this, but somewhere it falls down. Maybe I don't like my fellow diners used plates stacking up next to me (or even my own, for that matter) or being bumped and jostled all the time. I like to think of a sushi night as being...zen. This is more hustle n bustle, amped up energy at every turn and in my opinion this is a once and a while place, not somewhere I could see myself frequenting. I agree with others, the prices aren't that high but I would be willing to pay extra for the quality. Yes, it is a totally fun and unique experience. However, the eats at Kinjo really aren't for me. I would go back for the atmosphere and entertaining aspect of it, but if I want high quality sushi I will look elsewhere.   And, I totally agree - the pocky sticks really are such a nice touch, people love them and rave about that little addition. The staff are great and run a tight ship, yes all the outbursts of song and public humiliation happen. I kind of think that these things are the draw with this restaurant; there seems to be a faithful following among Calgarians and I'm alright with that."}
{"text":"I love this place! The decor is very warm and modern. The restaurant is really huge so there is always enough seating for people even on busy weekends. The service is friendly and efficient and I really like the nice touch of humour from the staff. Once you visit you'll definitely understand.  The food is great, no complaints. Usually every time I come here I get a complimentary plate of sushi to taste, which is awesome because this is how I found my favorite, the volcano roll. YUM.  I would definitely come back here, and I have been many times."}
{"text":"What a riot!  My first time to this place and I loved every minute of it. Lovely decor, soothing lighting, the staff make you feel comfortable right away. Watching the food being delivered to the tables was like being at a gallery opening to see the works of some fresh new artist. And the thing I liked the most was the gang of staff singing to/with us, banging drums and making my daughter and her boyfriend say loving things to each other. All in all, the experience it was a feast for the senses and had a kind of joyous feel to it. By the way, we were told by the staff that if they make sure the woman at the table is happy, then for sure the man will be happy. Makes sense to me."}
{"text":"If you have a hankering for some really bad sushi, this is your place. The land of rolls that had been made hours before you arrive, frozen sashimi and a completely oblivious staff.... what else can I say."}
{"text":"This is a great sushi place for fresh, fast, and delicious food :) they're also great for takeout if you're short on time!"}
{"text":"I LOOOOVE Kinjo. This is my favorite sushi spot in Calgary. The prices are extremely reasonable,  the service is usually pretty great and the fish is so fresh. There is a downside though; the wait sometimes. This place can be really busy, especially on weekends and Thursday and Friday nights. The best part is the Sushi boat. If you get a table along the bar, you can just grab and eat. Great for people who are hungry! The hot rolls are different and yummy, the tempura crisp and the teriyaki delicious. If you like sushi,  this is the place for you!!"}
{"text":"This was not the first time I have been to this place, however my latest visit really solidified my delight with this place. The restaurant is small but surprisingly comfortable. Sushi of different price points float by on a chain of boats,  a nice novelty and a nice variation on the old conveyor belt system that were once popular. The sushi that arrived on the boats for my selection were of the basic variety and of the most popular with customers. While the boats are temping in their novelty the best surprises are on the regular menu. The sushi tacos were very good and a nice fusion. The tempura was also very good.  The service was good but if you are looking for a quiet experience turn around. The whole crew will sing to you at the slightest indication of an event. It really adds to the fun atmosphere of this place. Don't leave without your box of pocky!   Check it out totally worth it!"}
{"text":"A very fun place to go for sushi. The staff are polite and helpful and fun. There was a birthday party when we were there and they made it fun for everyone. The restaurant is full of energy, good food and noise. Not the best place for conversations so if you're looking for a quite place, this isn't for you. Jo was very funny and polite and he was like a cheerleader. Overall I had a very good experience and I will go back there for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch at the recommendation of another BC transplant and was suitably impressed.  The salmon and tuna sashimi was very fresh.  The other rolls were a little tiny for the price but I am slowly getting used not having cheap sushi on every street corner.  Everything tasted good.  Small but good.    Tried the soy wraps and the lobster one was tasty.  One standout was the service - it was impressive.  Attentive and quick.  Plus all the ladies get a free box of Pocky - nice gimmick that totally works on me."}
{"text":"The wait is kind of long especially when you're really hungry but I personally think it is worth the wait. When you order your food it surprising comes pretty fast and the sushi here tastes amazing & is pretty filling."}
{"text":"Discusting, I went to the restroom and I saw a cook with the uniform in the restroom . I was there until he finished and he did NOT wash his hands and went back to the middle kitchen. I even stayed a lil more to see if he is going to watch and he did NOT. I left the place right away .. Discussing!!!"}
{"text":"This place is really a 4 star place, but I just... don't like being disturbed while I'm eating...  I'm sorry, but I would like this place a lot more if it didn't run the risk of Peter Kinjo visiting me everytime with his knife pointed at me.  If you go to Kinjo's for your first time it is entertaining at first when he tells you to hold the girls hand (it can be your mom, or your girlfriend) and tell you how much you love them and how beautiful they are... and he also gives you free pocky as a result, but the act got old years ago.  He's been using the same lines when this place opened 6-7 years ago?   I still return here for the food though.  I'm from Vancouver and so it's not really fair to compare sushi from between the two cities because I think Vancouver wins hands down... but for Calgary it's really good and consistent.  My favorite things here are the volcano roll, salmon (sake), the salmon with hollandaise sauce on it, the rack of lamb, and the magic steak (although it's not very large in size)."}
{"text":"Just moved into the neighbourhood and I think I just found my go-to dinner place.  Really great service and atmosphere made the sushi taste all the more delicious.  Plus, $3.50 pints every day of the week is pretty nice too.  We went on Sunday night with the snow flying outside, and still found the place to be packed.  They were able to seat us right away since there were only 2 of us, but larger groups didn't have to wait long to be seated either.  It's definitely a well-run establishment and I look forward to going back regularly whenever I get that sushi craving."}
{"text":"We've been going here for a while & always enjoyed the food, quick service & theatrics.  Never left without Pocky & always full.    Thanks Peter!"}
{"text":"Great sushi plus sushi boats plus great service and free poky means a GREAT family friendly dinner option. We go to Kinjo often since we all love it."}
{"text":"The food was great and fresh. The photos are what I normally order for two people. They are also the only restaurant to offer sweet soya sauce. Good value as fair as sushi restaurant go's. I have aways like this place."}
{"text":"Very average sushi, pretty bad prep area with the staff washing dishes etc. inches away from the boat. Slop all over the deep fryer and algae on the bottom of the \"old plastic boats\", spur of the moment choice...don't think I'll do it again."}
{"text":"Kinjo is one of those dingy sushi joints that you'd expect to be cheap, but it isn't.   The interior is brightly lit by fluorescents, adding a certain institutional ambiance. The place is generally busy with suburban types in cleats, or lu-lus, and it smells like mirin and stagnant water (you'll find out once seated the water is what your food comes on).     First off, the food plainly isn't good. The rolls are small, you can tell nothing is really made in house - mainly the tamago - and even the nigiri is served petite for the price.  They also proudly serve blue fin tuna as if it's going out of style (oh wait, it is. It's actually like, super endangered).   With a sushi spot that has the ambiance of a hospital waiting room, food similar to the dingy sushi joint in the strip mall, the ethical buying power of Trump himself, with the price tag of any, much better sushi places, I can't say I would ever recommended Kinjo.   But hey, for each our own. Bonus for the green tea pokies at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"I don't think i've ever had a bad experience here and i've been here upwards of 20 times, they are aways super fast, food is great, atmosphere even better. I love this place, i bring everyone here!"}
{"text":"I was here while very short on cash and my credit card had just been stolen so I was on a tight budget. My 14 yr old son went in to find us seating ahead of time as I was still dealing with hassles in the store nextdoor. He asked for a booth for 2 please. Not only did they seat him right away quickly and bring him free water and green tea, they brought him (before I even arrived, and I was only about 7 minutes behind him) FREE SUSHI APPETIZER amouse bouche (sorry - geez how do you spell that, I stopped taking French after grade 13....) So even though Im taking off a star because the prices are VERY VERY HIGH compared to what Im used to (Im from a Chinatown in Ontario where prices are so cheap Im used to ordering sushi for only about 60 cents per piece. NO pieces here were less than $2 each, and some were even $6 each for the special ones!) I have to give a high rating because that is really customer service above and beyond, for a brand new never seen before teenager who you dont know if you will ever see again and for all you know hes just on a date with a 12 yr old and they have just $5 to split between the two of them. Very very thoughtful and nice staff. Refilled our water many many times without asking, so sweet. And the sushi and sashimi itself is SUPER delicious and fresh. Will definitely return when I have more cash!    PS just to reinforce how happy I am that they gave free appetizer which is so alien to me.... our last go-to local pub was a very short 3 blocks from home in Unionville (just North of Toronto.) We enjoyed it and were there often, ie twice a month for 20 yrs. We never left the restaurant without paying at least $100 (we have 4 in our family.) So guess what - you do the math- that means Ive given the owners ( who are \"friends\" of my husband as they all play hockey together for almost 20 yrs) over $48,000!! NOT KIDDING !!!! Thats a good downpayment on a HOUSE! Guess how many times they have sent over free appetizers or god forbit a free cocktail ?????? NEVER !!!!!!!!!!!!! Never ever ever ever ever. Those cheap f*cks.   Thank you Kinjo !!!!"}
{"text":"First time customer. From the states and I have to say that the customer service was pretty good. they also gave me free pocky! that's awesome the girl that gave it to me was pretty cute too.   4 of ate about  100 worth of sushi.  I recommend trying the fried octopus it is super delicious. They don't over fry it till its crunchy like fries but just enough till the point when you bite it. The entire octopus outterlayer crunches just like soft fried bread and melts in your mouth.   BUT the floor is very slippery. I was wearing basketball shoes and it was a struggle walking to the bathroom.   I do recommend coming a little early for dinner because if you come around 6:30 or 7 it will be hard to find a seat.  Also if it is your birthday they will sing you a song so hey. Anyone that enjoys some sing along come during your birthday. They give you Pocky  sticks for free."}
{"text":"This Kinjo location is my favourite sushi restaurant because of the sushi-go-around. At peak times, there are a lot of varieties to choose from right on the sushi boat. However, if you go at off-peak hours, then your best option would be to order from the menu sheet, though it still doesn't take long at all for the order to come. Best part is that you'll never have the problem of ordering \"too much\" that you can't finish because you can literally take it off the sushi boat as you eat."}
{"text":"5 stars....I didn't want to me the kind of person who either gives 1 star or 5 stars. I wanted the first time I gave my 5 stars to someone to be special. Now my dreams have come true.   As soon as I walked through the door, I was greater by almost every staff member in the place at the same time. I know this is a gimmick they use here where the person at the door calls out something and everyone within earshot just yells out a generic hello, but it really make me smile.   We were sat quickly and brought out a plate with 4 rolls for us to try. I was excited. I walked in starving, and without having to say anything there was a plate of food in front of me.   The staff were incredibly friendly, almost tripping over each other trying to make sure we had what we needed. Then it Happened....  It was someones birthday. What an event that was. They must have sang 5 songs to this poor man. What was surprising was that all the staff involved seemed really excited to be celebrating this persons birthday. They even engaged the restaurant to join in. It was really fun to watch.   All in all I really enjoyed kinjos. The staff were very friendly, atmosphere was fun, food was fast and not to mention the free box of pocky. I was offered one but the girl I was with was. When I questioned this, the server said its cause \"you're sweet enough.\" Even men like to get compliments :)   The only thing I have to advise is make sure when you arrive, you have your entire party. They will not seat you until your party is complete. Kinda strange and not much of a sitting area while you wait.  However not a big enough deal for me to take away a star.   Stay hungry my friends  Justin"}
{"text":"I was back again the other day for a super-fast lunch. I let them know when I came in that I was in a hurry and everyone from the host to the server made sure everything went smoothly.  They brought me a sample plate before I could even fill in the sushi list. I kept it simple - some salmon sashimi and the special scallop sushi. Fresh and fabulous when it came, paid the bill and I was out the door in 30 minutes! Keep up the great teamwork Kinjo!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here for both dinner and lunch. Peter, the owner, ensures he greets everyone at the table with a great sense of humour and some free sushi.  The atmosphere is fun, well lit and comfortable. The food is authentic as is the very helpful Japanese staff. The variety of food to be had will keep you coming back."}
{"text":"A great balance for lovers of teppan-style food and excellent sushi, Kinjo does both effortlessly without the usual teppan price.   You can sit at the sushi bar and pick your treats right off the often-refreshed sushi boat, particularly during peak dining hours. A comprehensive list allows you to choose small portions of cooked fare, (such as steak, chicken or seafood) at a reasonable price, as well as sushi selections.   For fans of yakiniku sauce (Japanese-style steak sauce) be sure to ask for a bowl of rice with a side of \"Magic\" sauce. Fans of the Japanese Village steak sauce will not be disappointed!  If you're lucky, Peter, the owner, will stop by your table to crack a joke or offer you one of his Japanese pearls of wisdom. As you prepare to leave, you will surely be offered your choice of either strawberry or chocolate Pocky...that is IF you are female!  Overall, I prefer this restaurant over any other of its kind in Calgary. I hope you will too!"}
{"text":"Kinjo sushi is exactly what you'd expect from sushi in Calgary. And that's not a bad thing. I mean, it's not exactly very exotic or adventurous, but honestly, that's not what you want from a sushi establishment in a completely landlocked province. Nice and safe is the way I like my sushi when in Calgary. If I were in Vancouver or Tokyo, it would be a different story.  Kinjo has a wide variety of sushi and things like tempura, gyoza and korokke, all of which are pretty good. Their prices are also super reasonable, they have $3.50 pints of beer, and their sushi makes a great weeknight option since the restaurant near me is conveniently located in the neighborhood. Their take-out menu is a little weird, as you basically have to order pre-determined sushi combos. But you should be able to find something you like, so it works out.   Eating in at Kinjo is not necessarily for those who do not enjoy to be disturbed much during their meal, or for those who do not enjoy hearing the servers sing a very spirited Happy Birthday to a guest. So if you embarrass easily, and it's your birthday, probably don't make that known. I kind of like the entertainment sometimes, as I've seen some of the employees do some crazy knife tricks etc, but definitely not for everyone.   Tip: good luck getting a table in under 40 minutes on a Friday or Saturday night. The place is bumpin'. If you don't have the patients to wait, don't bother.  Oh, and free pocky after your meal. Extra points."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Well priced, attentive staff, and good sushi. Like the atmosphere in the rssturaunt. We'll be back"}
{"text":"I usually go to Kinjo and it's pretty good. Service isn't terrible and the food is decent. However takeout was a bit... Unhygienic. Called in and the lady was very nice saying she'd replace the order but I was three dishes in and didn't want to be that guy. I just let her know to check on the cleanliness of the staff. Had four dishes with hair in it."}
{"text":"So disappointed today.  I frequent this location and the service today was horrible.  We actually never saw our server today, they did not come to take the order, I had to wave my form to get someone's attention and we were seated in front the cooks.  No one came to see if the food was ok or if we needed a refill for our drinks or if we were done.  I put on my jacket and that was when someone noticed. Normally this location is so attentive and at the end they give each guest a pocky but they actually told us we could only have one.  It was disappointing."}
{"text":"Fair warning - if you are wanting a quiet night out with not much interaction, DON'T go here. Fortunately when I visited I wasn't looking for that. Often before I go somewhere I tend to check out their website, and try to determine what the atmosphere is like. This place looked like a lot of fun. Peter Kinjo was doing some rounds while we were there, big knife in hand. He was handing out boxes of Pocky to the ladies. However, when he approached the couples, the game often changed. Peter would have the guy hold his girlfriend's hand, profess his love for her, then give him the box of Pocky to give to her along with a kiss. We hadn't reserved a table, but we got seated quite quickly at the sushi bar. I haven't had enough sushi to be able to identify it as it floated by, so we ordered off the menu. The sushi was excellent, but it definitely got crowded with plates, etc. by the end. Had there been someone sitting beside me, we definitely would have had no room. They do this to keep track of what you eat by plate colors - different colors signify different prices. At one point during the meal, the staff stopped and did a musical number, with Peter leading it all. It was highly entertaining. I'd recommend watching the video on the \"Why Kinjo?\" page on their website before heading there to get a better idea of the atmosphere.  Definitely going to be going back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places to eat. Tons of awesome choices, friendly staff, reasonable prices. We live in Dalhousie and frequent Kinjo."}
{"text":"Love Kinjo! I am a huge Sushi fan and this place is amazing. I go there religiously. Great service and awesome food!"}
{"text":"Great dining experience. The free appetizer 4 piece dish was a nice touch. Sushi was high quality and in line with what I came to expect eating a lot of it in Vancouver. Much better than I expected for a sushi restaurant so far from the ocean. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing service! The food was awesome and the staff was amazing!! There was a server whose job was to bring around Pokey to the tables and he was so friendly and enthusiastic. I got the Philadelphia rolls, vegetable rolls, and the green tea ice cream and all were delicious! I would definitely come back next time I'm in Calgary! They even gave us coupons for our next visit!! Great atmosphere and I would recommend them to anyone :)"}
{"text":"Excellent selection. Everything so fresh.  Service was phenomenal. Will be going back."}
{"text":"Are you in the NW area? Looking for a great sushi restaurant? Look NO further. Head to Kinjo Sushi!  First things first, as soon as you take in the gorgeous decor of the restaurant and sit down, they will bring you a small plate of 4 complimentary sushi pieces. What a fantastic way to start the meal!   The portions are small - so that means you can get order a variety of stuff and get to try so many new stuff! Everything tastes amazing! Literally, everything I have tasted on this menu has been great, I have never been let down! The prices are SO reasonable, it makes you want to order everything!   The service is A+. If you're lucky that day, you may just get a small basket of complimentary tempura also! If the owner is there, you're in for laughs.. He walks around all the tables with his huge knife and talks to everyone at all the tables. If he sees a couple, he will make the guy profess his love for his girl and sing for her! If he sees a group of coworkers, he will make the male coworkers tell the female coworkers how lucky they are to work with them! Its hilarious! Really a great time! And then if he takes a liking to your table, he will bring you more sushi - complimentary!! I am so serious!!  Not to mention that they will cap of the meal with handing you a box of free Pocky sticks to take home!  Once again, if you're in the NW area, feelin' like sushi, and appreciate a great time during lunch OR dinner - Kinjo Sushi is the only place you should consider. Actually, just stop considering and head there immediately."}
{"text":"Kinjo is my go-to whenever I want good sushi. I am usually always up for trying new restaurants, but for sushi, I find a lot of restaurants underwhelming. Not so with Kinjo. I have never had a bad meal there, or a bad experience there.  Although my favourite one is the Kinjo at Dalhousie, the Macleod one will do in a pinch. Same great food, just a bit more packed and a bit more noisy. Great camaraderie, as is to be expected from Kinjo.  The other day I took 3 guests there and they were all very full and happy at the end of the meal. We ordered enough for all of us, lots of things to share, including tempura, tataki, edamame, agedashi tofu, and some unique rolls. All were tasty and inspired.   When the bill for the entire table came, it made me jump for joy. Very affordable, and I like that because I was footing it this time ;)   Review #5 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"This is place is wonderful - they nail the service every single time and there are lots of great options if you're not a huge seafood eater. The midori roll is a little pricey but my favourite thing on the menu, you also get free pocky sticks and usually some good entertainment from the pocky man. It's huge and always busy around supper time but I've never experienced slow service once seated even when it's packed. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Good food fair prices  Been going there for years  Nice people that serve you  Clean and feel i got value"}
{"text":"How did we not try this place sooner??  After working like crazy to clean and move heavy furniture in my livingroom (on my birthday no less) while my other half worked the Calgary Comic Expo all day, neither of us were interested in cooking that night so when a friend of ours said he loved this place we thought we'd finally give it a try.  It's right down the street so why we didn't go sooner I have no idea....  It's a busy sushi shop that is a lot bigger than it looks from the outside.  Clean, bright, and they give you menus and a pad so you can write down what you want.  I tried their negitoro roll, a philadelphia roll (cheating for my current diet but it was my birthday so meh), the chicken karaage, a hot california roll, split a shrimp tempura and an onion rings, and split I think the tiger roll, because it had unagi on top and wasn't the golden dragon one (D ate the head on that, it was so cute)!  I wish their salmon was wild, not farmed, but it was fresh and didn't have the usual tasteless-farmed-salmon taste/texture to it so at least it was quality stuff.  The tuna was delicious, and the tempura onion rings are now a favourite...  I definitely look forward to trying more of their menu once our crazy diet is over!"}
{"text":"12/30  This place is always packed! I went here last night to celebrate two birthdays, and probably ate two birthdays worth of sushi. Everything here is well made and reasonably priced.   We waited a little while for a booth and watched in anticipation as a tiny army of servers quickly cleaned one up for us. As soon as we sat down, one appeared with a little complimentary sampler plate of different rolls. You'll get about 3 servers every time you eat here and they're often pretty go! go! go! So you won't get to catch a name unless they stand still long enough for you to read a name tag. They operate like a well-oiled machine.   If you plan on eating a lot of food here, wait for a booth. Otherwise, you'll be putting your plate of sushi on your lap while trying to make room for the other stuff you ordered on the narrow bar. Even if you're just grabbing plates off the boats, since they're charging you per plate; they won't get cleared off and you'll have a small stack going pretty quickly. Wait for a booth.  Yeah, I've been here on dates before, where Peter forced my date to take my hand and sing to me. Eesh. But since he's moved on to the Dalhousie location; it hasn't happened again :D. My favorite thing to order here is the Vegetable Roll, and I've been here so often, they know to make it for me without mayo. It comes with avocados and strawberries, nomz! I also got to try their spinach gomae last night. It was so good, but it arrived late, so I could barely finish it. Kinjo always makes me sad that I can't eat more. Kinjo has also recently put a list of their vegetarian-friendly items on the back of their specials menu! I love when I can eat more than just two or three things at a restaurant!  Also: Free Pocky for everyone after every meal! If it's your birthday, they give you Almond Crush Pocky :)"}
{"text":"Fast paced. Good sushis. Not wow sushis. Ok prices. Too busy servers can't be okay if you dont expect to be treated like princess.  The one near 53 st exit on crowchild is waaaaay better!"}
{"text":"The service was nice and the overall atmosphere was vibrant. However, the sushi was OK - nothing special."}
{"text":"Had been in place a couple times. Today I ordered Sashimi, and it officially close the connection between me and this restaurant from now on. The fish was not that fresh and caused me diarrhea....."}
{"text":"Okay I don't know why you would ever give this place less than 6/5, but you know, 5 is the maximum so I'll settle for that.   Let me start out by saying I've had a lot of sushi in my life. I've lived in Calgary, Toronto, and Vancouver, and THIS place. This specific restaurant is my favourite sushi place in Canada. I've been in Toronto for the last 3 years, studying downtown, and try as I might, I cannot find another place that even comes close to what Kinjo is (and yes, I've been to Wow Sushi up near Yonge and Bloor). Vancouver understandably has better materials, however I weep for the fish which are, more often than not, ruined by the unforgiving hands of amateur chefs. Kinjo is different. The food hits all the right spots on your tongue, and I just don't know how they do it.  I'm not sure if the baby octopus (menu item #75 or #68. It's been years) is still on the menu or taken off the menu, but that was the best thing ever. All of their rolls taste amazing, and after going to Kinjo, I now refuse to eat my sushi with anything other than sweet soy sauce. Seriously, I go to a sushi place, taste their soy sauce, and if it's bad I ask the waiter for sugar, which always gets me this perplexed look, but I just refuse anything else.   I seriously want to fly back and stay for a month simply to enjoy their sushi. It's just fantastic. I'm not one to seriously exaggerate, but Kinjo is like the freaking Tom Hiddleston of sushi restaurants. It messes with your standards, and anything after it gets compared to this golden standard but none can surpass it."}
{"text":"Loved it, loved it! At first glance, this place may appear be pricey but it is not!  The space is large and roomy and very clean. Service was fantastic!  From the owner, we would given complimentary lobster bites on a fried won ton. Sooo good! (not on menu!)   Ordered: Green tea (for 2) Chicken fried rice Fried Spring rolls Dynamite rolls Tempura Shrimp Tempura Asparagus Teriyaki Beef (the sauce on top was deelish!)  We ordered in 2 instalments as we were not sure how large the dishes were - they are small so if the above order gives you some idea on what 2 hungry people would have - there ya go! And $30.71 plus tip! Amazing deal.  Nice to get a box of Pocky at the end of the meal from the server! Who doesn't love chocolate covered thin biscuit sticks! I grabbed both that she held up including the strawberry - I was only supposed to choose one? LOL!  We give this place 4.5 stars - a half star taken off for a small detail - likely the food you order at once does not come out all at once. Just in case you wanted to eat a few things combined, you may have to wait a bit as some things get cooked before others.  Overall, a lovely find and it wasn't too busy tonight! (Usually the place/parking lot appears packed!)"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first visit to Kinjo. I came by with my husband and my friend. It was very loud and quite busy when we arrived but we were seated immediately. We quickly ordered and the waitress confirmed everything before leaving our table.  The food came out in stages. The first round did not include any of what I ordered and the second round was only what I ordered. This can't be helped since they don't know who ordered what, I just found it funny.  When we had all our food and we're finished eating, we had to wait quite a while before a server came around. Even when they did come around, they never stopped. My husband had to interrupt someone to bring us a box. This is the only reason they did not get 5 stars. Service was good, but not consistent.  Upon paying our bill a staff member came around offering Pocky to the girls. Thus made me ridiculously happy and is just one reason I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Consistency in  experience is death. A restaurant should strive in consistency in flavour, but come up with different ways to experience that flavour. This rule never seems to apply Kinjo, a place which used to be home to my least favorite sushi in the city.   But what Kinjo has done to be able to deliver a tried and true experience is actually quite remarkable. I know that when I go there for sushi it will be a quick in and out, I know what sushi will be floating on their boats, and most importantly I know it will be good.  Kinjo is still not the best sushi in the city, but they are the best at what the do. They deliver on taste in a short amount of time at very reasonable prices. They are maybe the closest thing to the sushi version of fast food.  My recommendation for this Kinjo is to come in and eat what's on the boats, maybe order some shrimp tempura,  pay your bill and leave.Don't try to make this place any more than that and you will leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5 Atmosphere: 3/5 Service: 3.5/5 Overall experience: 3/5  (1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)  **Been busy and just catching up on old reviews. This is based on my visit last year**  After hearing good reviews from my sister's and mom's friends we decided to come here as a family for dinner. Honestly, I'm a little adverse to the other reviews since I only found this place mediocre. My entire family agrees with me and that we've had better sushi elsewhere.   We went on a busy Friday night and thankfully managed to get a table before a rush of people came in after us. It's your typical Japanese restaurant except they have a giant sushi conveyor belt in the middle where you can pluck individual sushi dishes from. Then there's several chefs busy rolling out sushi and making tempura within the area.  Once we were seated we ordered some green tea which came out lukewarm - disgusting! Every table received free samples of tempera and a few sushi pieces before ordering. I thought it was a pretty unique concept and excellent ploy to boost customer experience. The tempera was greasy and the shrimp was small and over battered. The sample sushi pieces were really small but I found it very flavourful and wanted more.  To further 'enhance' customer experience, there was this crazy, over enthusiastic Asian man wielding a knife (owner) who greeted us and presented all the girls/women at the table with a box of strawberry pocky. I thought the free pocky was awesome but the theatrics from the owner was over kill. slightly entertaining at first, but I just sat there with the most uncomfortable, fake smile on my face. My mom and I found it super awkward talking to him and I just wanted him to go away!   The menu consisted of your typical sushi/sashimi ranging from $3-$5 and up to $7 depending on what you get; large varieties of temperas and deep fried foods like calamari, fried veggies and karrage; grilled meats, rice and noodles dishes; and unique sushi combos from $9-$15. We ordered a few basic sushi dishes such as the salmon/tuna roll (6 pieces for $3.25); the special Male Dragon roll of crab meat, avocado, cucumber, unagi and tempera (8 pieces for $11); and a Spider Roll to go (5 pieces for $9). I was expecting terrific sushi from what i've heard and i found it  just average. The special rolls didn't seem very unique to me and I didn't like how I got dinky sushi pieces for the price they were charging me. I've had bigger rolls, for the same quality at a slightly cheaper price elsewhere. The unagi wasn't fresh and was overly sauced.  Overall, the service, free samples and pocky were great (not something you would see at restaurants), but the sushi and atmosphere kinda fell short. It just didn't live up to my expectations."}
{"text":"Cheap, affordable and pretty dang good is called to my mind when thinking of Kinjos. The food is brought extremely quickly in my opinion. The friendliness and helpfulness of servers helps sushi elite and beginners find and explore new items! My only complaint is that the menu is sometimes difficult to interpret and then mark down on your sheet. Thankful every employee is helpful in pointing out where you can find an item on the list. This isn't going to be the best sushi you will ever have, but it'll be the best affordable sushi you've ever had."}
{"text":"Love Kinjo! Food: delicious. Atmosphere: busy, fun, interesting, exciting. Service: fast, friendly, efficient.  Their fish and meat is fresh and delicious. Rolls are expertly prepared. And they even have lots of interesting and delicious things for vegetarian sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices! Not the prettiest sushi restaurant in town but certainly one of the friendliest. The place gets busy but the staff remains helpful. The food is prepared quickly but with precision. Lots of average dishes but there are plenty of standouts! You can order off the menu or pick plates off the floating boats (if you're sitting at or around the bar)."}
{"text":"I am shocked that I haven't reviewed Kinjo yet. This place is my go-to sushi venue in Calgary. It's unbelievably unpretentious, but also very high quality. No, you will not find some of the over-the-top extravagant creations found at, say, Bar Zipang. But what you will find is a venue that is full of fun, loud people having a great time.  It's very reasonably priced, to boot. As long as you don't mind some elbow-to-elbow sushi-eating frenzy, you'll have a great time here.  I have been told by the staff that part of their quality strategy involves charging less for sushi. It sounds counter-intuitive, but he says that it allows them to turn more sushi over faster. As a result, they save costs on expensive additional refrigeration and can serve their customers fresher sushi, sooner. This is one thing I can say with certainty about Kinjo--that their sushi is always fresh. No matter what time of day you go or what day of the week, you won't have a gamey tuna sashimi. Every sushi place I have been to elsewhere has been guilty of this at some point.  I've been to Kinjo probably around 50-60 times now and can only say good things about it. The place is always packed, but as long as you come in a small group, you'll get in quickly and the food will come at you fast! I miss having Peter at the south location, threatening the men with his sushi knife if they don't adequately serenade their date, but the other guys have done a great job of picking up the slack.  Must have items: Volcano rolls, Spicy Salmon Crunch, giant squid legs (squid kara-age basically), and assorted sashimi. They also make a wicked sesame steak sauce. Stay off the boat if you can--the menu items are really interesting and worth spending your money on. Use the boat as filler or to grab the odd volcano roll."}
{"text":"The food here is great, the atmosphere lively and friendly and the staff is outstanding. We had the bluefin combo, volcano roll and Jay-Mak roll. All were delicious! Special shout out to our server John (who was in training) and Petrol with his singing crew.   We live in the San Francisco Bay Area and were visiting my sister in Calgary. The servers and singers at Kinjo were nothing short of gracious on the complimentary dishes, Pocky sticks, singing and attentive service. We have eaten at many restaurants and have never experienced the warmth, graciousness and fun that we did at Kinjo.  We watched Petrol and his singing crew at the other tables, they were so entertaining and are naturals with the adults as well as the kids. Thanks Kinjo for a truly special dining experience! Please keep spreading joy through your delicious food and human kindness."}
{"text":"This is a complicated review. Kinjo was one of my go to sushi places, usually the one by Chinook, but if it just the hubs and I, we come to this locations. The reason this is complicated is, the server was wonderful and honest, but I'm disappointed in the fakeness.   Being a celiac, eating is difficult. Sushi was always good, it's fish and rice. So I thought. I quickly found out that I need my own GF soy sauce, which is fine I have purchased it, as well, a lot of sushi places carry it now. After mentioning this the server questioned our whole order and what was mine, as a lot of their stuff isn't authentic and does contain gluten.   I am not even able to have their salad, which is supposed to be a house made dressing. Their miso actually has gluten too. IMO Kinjo is like McDonald's of sushi. It's a fast food sushi, that doesn't have good quality, they want you in, and out.   So I am disappointed to say it will be a long time till i go here again, as I can't have my usuals and have been sick enough times from here."}
{"text":"Never order take-out (Skip the Dishes) here. I've eaten many times in-restaurant before and never had a problem then. But now I feel like they don't care as much for take-out. Even though I knew it says that order will take up to 110 min to be delivered, I just thought it was because they are busy, which I was willing to deal with. The food arrived cold, the tempura are soggy. So the food was actually done cooking on time, and it was obvious that it's been sitting out for quite a while. So I don't understand why the delivery time can be shortened so food is ready to go as soon as it is cooked. The tuna sashimi also had plasticy strings/film, which makes me think that it wasn't cut properly, and made it very difficult to eat as we had to pull the plasticy things out as we are chewing."}
{"text":"Honestly, I usually am not inclined to write reviews on businesses, but I was so blown away with this place that I needed to review. I was in town for the day, and wanted to go for Sushi and when I stumbled upon Kinjo I was amazed. We got free samples of various rolls, free edamame beans as well as a free dessert. Our meal was very fast to arrive, the service was top notch and it only came out to under 20 dollars to be stuffed.  Do not miss out on this place, you need to go!"}
{"text":"Kinjo himself is a bit of a boob (he loves to interrupt your meal to threaten the boyfriend/husband with a fake knife, then offer Pocky) but the food is so fantastic it's worth it. If you can get a table next to the rotating trays of sushi (and grab a volcano roll) you're in for a treat."}
{"text":"Kinjo is not my first choice for sushi, but their very family friendly atmosphere is a huge plus for me when I want to eat Japanese food with my two young kids.  Since they're always so busy, the food is pretty fresh as the turnover is huge, though a fellow Yelper has told me that some of the sushi in my pics look like it was made by amateurs.  I suppose since I cut them up with scissors for my kids anyway, I'll let them get away with that, lol.  However, it is not cheap to eat here.  The price per dish ranges depending on the item and those plates add up very quickly! Also, don't expect authenticity here.  Rather, enjoy a fun experience for family of all ages! I think this is why they're so popular.  Service varies greatly depending on the server, but they are usually eager to help."}
{"text":"Food: taste is good, the sushi nigiri needs some work but there rolls are awesome. Service: fast (probably because they were about to close). Interior design: awesome! Very good date night atmosphere and music. Prices: good. Would go again."}
{"text":"I never imagined that I would ever involve a getting-stuck-in-an-elevator story in a review . But, our whole department, in making an unwise discussion in testing an elevator's limits, was all stuck simultaneously for over an hour. I'm not going to go into much detail there because to me it all played exactly how it would depicted in sitcoms, just pure hilarity. Once they got the elevator working, we all happily jumped out like clowns from...a clown car.For being good sports, our managers gave us an all-you-can eat Friday lunch pass. Tired of the same old pizza orders, I suggested we order take-out from Kinjo sushi.  Kinjo has received a lot of love for its in-store experience and deserves as much towards its take-out experience. We were worried that we had to wait till 11:30am (which was Kinjo's official opening time) to place our order, but when my manager called Kinjo @ 9:30am, she spoke to the enthusiastic Andre, who took our order and guaranteed to have it available by 10:30am for pickup. In fact, he even threw in a free mango/shrimp tempura roll with a few boxes of pocky sticks.  The food was great quality and tasted fresh. I usually find that for take-out orders, a lot of the quality found in an in-store experience degrades due to the time it takes to transport the food. But Kinjo's sushi was neatly packed with space to breathe between each pieces of sushi. The presentation of the rolls and nigiri were according to how you would receive them if you had ordered at the restaurant. Their combo plates are great and while I found their nigiri fish fresh, I really enjoyed their maki rolls.  Someday I'll be able to stroll into Kinjo's restaurant and have the opportunity to extend a firm handshake to the man Andre himself. Maybe I'll take an elephant with me to an elevator in hopes of getting another free lunch :D"}
{"text":"Dined with family. Menu is definitely unique, some items I've never seen before - at Kinjos and other Japanese restaurants, and I've known and eaten Peter's food since ... well, before 2000.  We were short on time, but I was assured by the rest of our party that they would be able to feed us promptly and we would be out of there in an hour.  While I rather enjoy savouring my sushi, sake and company dining out at Japanese establishments, sometimes you just have to eat and get going.  Thankfully, I was not misled.  Service was attentive, food wicked fast and fresh. Those two don't always go together. (I *hate hate hate* pre-made sushi).  Thankfully, the folks on the sushi line are popping them out as fast as we could order  Some birthdays and special occasions were celebrated while we were dining, lots of fanfare with all the staff participating. Thank goodness they don't make you wear the robe and hat any more!  It's an atmosphere thing. There are worse things.  We didn't have a reservation, but at 5pm on a Monday... probably don't need one.  I must say that every dish we ordered was very good quality meat.  The sashimi platter for $19 had large, meaty slices of tuna and salmon, a scallop, and I think there was hamachi as well as properly cooked tako - and I've eaten a lot of awful octopus to get to this nicely steamed morsel.  The daikon and cucumber slices were a really welcome layer on the dish too - so many sushi places have been cheating me of one of my favourite vegetables. I know it's expensive, but it's worth it, I want it!  The negitoro pieces were great, we also had some grilled scallops that I wasn't sure I could eat - but the others at our table were pleased with the quality of the dish.  They also offer the soy wrap for cones. Interesting, and not seen very often.  Even my nephew likes it, and that's saying a lot.  We also had gyoza, chop chop, California roll and rainbow roll. While the size of the rolls was a bit disappointing (I've had more substantial rolls), they were ok sized and tasty.    My nephew also ordered the ice cream pear for dessert.  I hear it's sourced locally from Amato Gelato. Unfortunately, I couldn't get a shot before the whip cream melted and the lovely presentation was destroyed.  He enjoyed it immensely.  We were also greeted with the traditional send off gift of Pocky.   Thao B. Does have some good points, but when I've had as much lousy sushi around the province for the same or more money... I pick Peter's.   According to the rest of the party, it's busy at this location, not only because of the quality, but because of the scarcity of Japanese food in the NW.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite restaurant. I'm there almost weekly for lunch or dinner; many of the servers recognize me and my family. We always have a positive experience. Even feeling like VIPs at times. I have never had a bad experience. Usually when I go Maddie is working and she is an amazing girl! She's so friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"We found this place very pleasant and a good fun to chat and eat. From the outside or passing by the restaurant, it seems crowded. However, we were seated right away when we walked in. The servers were also very pleasant and quick to serve. We opted to seat by the sushi bar so we can just grab sushi plates. We enjoyed the food very much- sushi is suchi anyways. Aside from the sushi and sashimi saucers, we also ordered edamame, chicken katsu, shrimp tempura, and green tea ice cream for dessert. All of the dishes were good though I prefer the chicken katsu lighter in color or not too fried. For $60 plus tip for 2 people I say is good enough.I was full and the hubby had enough too. We'll definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Came here today with my friends. I've been to two other locations, the Dalhousie and the one by the district.   I was surprised with how small this location was compared to the others. It looked old and outdated inside. And the restaurant had a sweaty smell to it.. Almost like when you're at the gym.   From where I was sitting, I could see behind the little curtain, they had trays of dirty dishes on the floor which looked very unappealing and I know that shouldn't be on the floor. Makes me wonder what else they do that they shouldn't be doing.   The service there was quite adequate. We had a very nice server. The food came out fast.   The size of the rolls and portions were a lot smaller compared to the other locations I've been to.   When we got our bill, it was close to $100 and I was surprised because the three of us weren't very full.   Those are my reasons why I gave them a 3/5.  I'll probably stick to the other locations from now on."}
{"text":"This place is the most fun Sushi place I have ever been to.   The restaurant itself is gorgeous, it's has a million tables and beautiful decor. When I was here, it was constantly full and what a great vibe! The wait staff were all great to me and I just loved being here. I ended up being here for 4 hours and was treated so well.  The food was delicious, service great, atmosphere a ton of fun...I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"There is only one thing about this place is it is noisy and very live if your expecting a quiet night the other locations are a bit quieter like the Dalhousie location.  This is in my opinion the tastiest and freshest sushi in Calgary I have tried at least 50 restaurants . Sure other restaurants have nicer tables / interior but nobody compares to the food and service as this sushi place . Sadly I moved to Edmonton and don't have any more kinjo  . I will always stop in when back in Calgary ."}
{"text":"We were sat immediately and greeted at the bar and shortly after with some complimentary rolls and our beverages were delivered promptly after ordering and were left never empty for the remainder of our experience. We sat at the bar which had a sushi train and the sushi production in the middle; it was great to watch everything going on. The service was most definitely attentive and friendly. We tried the volcano rolls, dynamite rolls, spicy tuna rolls, spicy tuna cone, Toro sashimi and vegetarian rolls. All were very good, but the volcano rolls were to die for! We will definitely go back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"I'm not really a Sushi fan; I'll normally only ever go out for Sushi if I am dragged out. Well after a couple of trip to Kinjo that changed!  The night started with a quick wait and seating for my wife and a group of friends at the bar - you get to watch food being cooked and plates (along with messages from other customers) pass you buy on the boats.   Almost immediately a staff member comes by with free samples and to take your drink order - we got a large sake - it was delicious and a very good value for $9.  I explained to the server I didn't like sushi, and was pleasantly surprised by her response.  There are tons of non-sushi items on the menu. Everything from ginger beef to chicken stir fries to fried rice to steak bites and more. They also have a number of hot sushi-style stuff - like Alberta Beef Rolls - Alberta beef wrapped in rice with cucumber and sauce to look like sushi. I was really impressed.  Well I ordered the Alberta beef rolls, the tempura vegetables, and some dumplings and was quite satisfied. Then I got adventurous!   I tried california rolls, some sort of veggie sushi (they have a large vegetarian menu and can make vegan options too. or sub brown rice in for white), the smoked salmon rolls, and the hot california rolls. I was quite amazed. Sushi is awesome!   Just as we were preparing to get our bill Andrea came over and made my night. He was super friendly and so enthusiastic about my new sushi experience. He gave us Pocky and welcomed us back anytime. We ended up coming back the following week, and as I write this review I am already planning another trip on Tuesday."}
{"text":"Every time someone new walks through the door the whole sushi bar crew yell something in Japanese that sounds like \"Lashi\". We asked Henri what it meant and he said it was to welcome them and to warn the sushi chef crew to get ready. It certainly helped create a fun atmosphere. When you sit down, they bring you a free sampler and I enjoyed all four pieces.  We had about five trays of the Volcano roll which was a little spicy but very good. I tried the Egg roll, which was battered egg on top and tempura yam inside. It was different but a really nice addition to the regular sushi. All in all, the sushi was very good. Unfortunately I must say that the Tempura shrimp was not great but everything else made up for that."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and service. I never had a interest in fish sushi until I tried some of the samples that were offered. Good place for a date night,"}
{"text":"Good sushi but sooo expensive! The dragon roll had eyes and a head hahah it was cute!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has become one of my favorite sushi please in the NW.  The service was good the couple of times that we've been here.  The food was very good overall.  Their Toro is also very good and real unlike some restaurants in town.  Prices are not too bad.  How much you want to spend really depends on how much of an appetite you have.  For quality food, I really don't mind spending the extra money."}
{"text":"Pure quality and absolutely delicious! Dine in, take out and delivery! I've eaten at a ton of sushi restaurants throughout Canada and US and this restaurant is in my top ten! Good job Kinjo!! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars because you close too early :("}
{"text":"I have been going to Kinjo for many years and it seems that the food quality has diminished.  Overall still as a okay."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best Sushi restaurant in Calgary, as least NW Calgary.  The only time I've waited for a table was one time on a weekend.  A large restaurant, they always seem to have a table ready.  The food is creative and delicious.  The restaurant is clean and modern.  You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"If only Yelp allowed half stars, I was leaning more on the 3.5  Pros: - Complimentary sample rolls. They came out with 4 different rolls that were complimentary. Who doesn't like free? Score! - Free pocky at the end of the meal. I had the green tea pocky and I really enjoyed it. - Service was great! - Sashimi had really nice thick slices  Cons: - The rolls were okay - Even though the sashimi slices were thick, the best out of the assorted fish we had was salmon. The rest were okay.   This place is spacious. I think this is one of the spacious sushi restaurants I've ever been to. It would be good for parties"}
{"text":"This is the first of all the Kinjo restaurants in the city of Calgary, Alberta.. I believe. It was also the first sushi restaurant I went to and because of that it will always be my favourite.  One thing to say about this restaurant... VOLCANO ROLL!!  I love the food, atmosphere and people here, however, this specific location loses one star because of how small the restaurant is. being beside Chinook and os central makes it extremely popular and the restaurant inside is small and the parking is small as well. You need to have patience. Especially going there when you are hungry and with 3 or more people you will need to wait for a table but if you are hungry enough you will settle for sitting at the sushi bar which is fine but unfortunate because your group of friends can't face each other as you are sitting side by side but if you go with two people or by yourself its fine.  Sushi is becoming a big trend and no matter how many other sushi restaurants I go to or try I will always come back to this one because this is the one that started everything for me."}
{"text":"Since moving here last May I have only been to one other sushi place, and it honestly does not compare at all to this one! I am still eager to see what other sushi places are in town, so gave this 4 stars instead of 5 as I don't really have a good comparison. However I will say it was very tasty sushi/sashimi and the service was very good!   Seeing as I had never been to this restaurant before, the friend I went with advised me on some of the good sashimi and rolls they had tried on previous visits. For our first round (yes multiple rounds happened here!) we ordered Lobster wrapped in seaweed (can't remember the proper name, sry!), salmon sashimi, unagi sashimi, spicy tuna rolls, mango rolls, cream cheese rolls, and grilled shrimp.   The rolls and sashimi came out in good time, and right away we dug in. Them mango rolls were sweet and had tempura shrimp. Although tasty not my favorite of the night. The salmon and unagi sashimi was so delicious! Very buttery and tender salmon, and the eel was nicely glazed and cooked, very tender as well. The spicy salmon rolls were good, but nothing that made them stand out, the shrimp were tasty as well, they had what tasted like a cheese/creamy sauce on them. I am not a huge fan of cream sauces so these were only okay for me. However my friend mentioned that in previous visits the shrimp was much better, so wondering if they changed things up. I tried the lobster wraps and they were surpringly good! It had a lot of pepper in it, and it seemed there was a mix of chopped and finely grated lobster in the mix. A tasty new dish for me.   Now as we came to the end of our 8 piece mango roll my friend noticed a piece of plastic in it! So we saved the piece and showed the waitress when she came back around. She apologized profusely and took the roll off our bill, which was very kind of her. It is one of those things were it happens and no need to make a big deal out of it, we were lucky to catch it and bring it to the waitress and cooks attention. Our second round of food included another dish of salmon sashimi, volcano rolls and unagi rolls. I ate the plate of volcano rolls (x4 )and my friend the unagi (x4) (he had never tried unagi before so after trying the sashimi he ordered the rolls too! So brave :P). The salmon sashimi was obviously a favorite of ours for the night and I think the volcano rolls were my favorite roll. I had a sweet sauce at our table and it paired really well with the volcano roll, which is a tad spicy.   At the end of our meal the manager came out and provided us with a complimentary dessert as a peace offering after the plastic incident. This was a total surprise, and again very kind of them, so kudos to the staff and manager for their consideration and service last night! The cheesecakes were chocolate and a lighter milk cheesecake. Both delicious and a perfect way to end the evening. There are several Kinjo Sushi locations in the city, if I can recall one in Mission and another on Macleod. So for the future I will try to go to one closer downtown to avoid the traffic we hit driving up to Dalhousie."}
{"text":"Very quick service and delicious food! New style of giving foods and it was great! For Koreans who can't speak English very well there is korean waitresses. A bit pricey but overall awesome place!"}
{"text":"I tried Kinjo's because of the high rated comments... after checking out  there website http://www.kinjosushiandgrill.com I was convinced.   First off I admit the food is delicious! I had: - Spicy Salmon Roll 8/10 - Avocado tempura 7.5/10 - Dynamite roll 7/10 - house salad 6/10 - Spicy Chicken 6/10  My experience: I came around 7pm (Friday) during their busy service, I gave the woman my name for 2. Than asked what the waiting time would be... she gave me 'deer in the headlights' look than smiled. I repeated myself and she replied \"what waiting time?\" After conversing back and forth for 2 minutes I gave up... it was clear she was diverting her answer and wouldn't give me an estimate time.  After waiting 20 minutes, sharing my personal bubble space with strangers the crowd soon began to turn over as people were paying for the bill and leaving... they fail to mention the misfortune if you arrive before a large group the management will not give you a table without 3 people or more. Individuals are expected to be seated at the sushi bar.   1 person ahead of me wasn't allowed to be seated until her guest arrived. So needless to say many people got served before her and us. I began to notice a trend of people who came after us that were party of 2 getting seated first... I than got agitated. The incompetent hostess skipped our reservation! grrr... When I reminded her... she than found a place immediately to seat us. With an hungry stomach and a ridiculous waiting time I was less than thrilled to be there.  Our waitress was obviously busy and preoccupied struggling to make her way over to us... when she finally was able to take our order, the rolls were floating on plastic motioned boats and were pulled. Half my dinner was ready to eat in no time. However the salad, spicy chicken and tempura toke 20 mins to prepare. All my food was given to me before my guest... who waited 40 minutes for chicken and Brocolli Tempura. The consistency and time was WAY OFF!   I also should point out the place was so lively with people and noisy I could barely hear myself. I felt lost and confused in the midst of the chaos. When I went to pick up the bill the ditzy incompetant hostess proved AGAIN her inability to do her job. She messed up my bill, charging me for our dinner and the guy sitting next to me aswell.  $80 for two ladies.... I don't think so!  After eating I was full but not belly aching stuffed. The only thing that came across my mind was : Can't wait to get the heck outta there, next time doing pick-up instead!"}
{"text":"This is one of my family's favorite sushi places.  All of the staff are friendly, efficient and exuberant(especially when the group comes to sing at your table during special occasions).   Although Kinjo's does not take reservations, they are extremely good at managing crowds(and the lineups do get long, especially on Fridays, Saturdays, and long weekends) and turning tables.    We've been here several times and every time the sashimi has been fresh and delicious.  My favorite grilled items are the black cod(or sablefish--I love its delicate texture and slight sweetness), scallops, crab claws, and the tempura lobster roll. The servers have always delivered all our dishes to the table in a timely manner(they use a checklist system). With so many plates going out almost all at once during peak hours, I have never seen them mix up a single order.    They are also very family friendly here(although children 12 months and under may find this place over-stimulating).  In addition to free Pocky, complimentary fruit(an orange shaped like the face of a monkey) and a children's menu are available to the  young 'uns..."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat, feel very welcome right when you walk in the door! Not a stranger. Service was very fast, and received a free sample dish of some of the popular items ordered, which was great! Open kitchen is always a favourite.  Did not have to pay a lot of money for a very enjoyable meal out, will be regularly coming back thank you!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the food is always delicious and great value. They come with a free 4 sushi sampler for the table so its best to bring 4 people or less :)   I can get a few rolls for less than 20 bucks, I usually get the yam roll, scallop(hotate), salmon roll or rainbow roll and tempura or baby octupus, I always get the chicken udon soup because its a big bowl of Udon and really flavorful and filling.   I have gotten the magic steak before but it wasn't anything special, the chicken karaage is pretty good but there is a bit too much sauce.   I have never gotten desserts because I always end up too full by the end :) They give free pocky at the end of your meal too, but now they've changed to mini cookies which are good also.  I highly recommend this place especially if you live in the NW, it's at dalhousie ctrain station and delicious.  Edit: Just went for sushi a few days ago, don't get the hot beef roll, they don't do half orders and the rice just blends in with the tempura a thick tasting sushi that is too salty."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is friendly and a bit confusing but served quickly. The ratings were highs and so were our expectations but truthfully is was just mediocre sushi. There was no amazing flavours and just OK. I gave it a two because frankly it was not displayed nicely nor flavourful. Just ok. Meh. Dishes were forgotten. Staff were kind and sweet!"}
{"text":"It's probably not the best quality fish you can get but it's definitely bang for your buck. I thought it was a decent meal and I thought everyone who worked there was extremely helpful. I went in and got my usual spicy tuna roll and yellowtail, and left feeling satisfied. I'd return for the convenience and also for those Pocky treats at the end!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi here. Restaurant has traditional Japanese design, and at the same time is very modern and clean everywhere. Staff is very nice here and comes quickly when you ask for service. Food arrived pretty quickly even though the restaurant was full."}
{"text":"The sushi at kinjo is very good and the service is even better. The price is based of plate colour as it is with most sushi boats and you can also special order the thing you specifically what!   I will add that the restaurant is not nearly as fancy on the inside as it looks from the outside, but if it is the ambiance you're looking for this is great sushi"}
{"text":"Me and my husband have tried many Japanese restaurants and this has the best sashimi!! We love the fatty toro so much and we will definitely go back and try more! The service is great and I was offered a free Pocky a nice guy. I will recommend this restaurant to my friend."}
{"text":"Glad we came here to top of our last night in Calgary! Kinjo was local for us, and us Torontonians had a craving for some sushi! When we arrived we had a choice of either sitting in a booth or sitting by the sushi bar which had had plates of various sushi dishes floating on a conveyor boats!!! yes... so essentially while you eat, these dishes float by and you can decide whether or not to take it.   The dishes are categorized by colors which determine the prices; Red- $3.45/ Yellow- $3.95/ Blue $4.25 with each order having 4 rolls.   By the end of it all we ordered their Volcano which had a kick of spice to it, california roll, spicy salmon, yam sushi, etc. Overall the presentation was someWHAT satisfactory, the service was exceptionally great, and the servers are personaable and knowledgable with their sushis!! The place is clean, and Kinjo seems to be a popular place in the neigborhood.   What I did not like about this place was the amount of rice they used, it was not equally proportioned, as well, some of our rolls fell apart easily. WOuld I come back here, maybe, maybe not as there are other sushi places around this area."}
{"text":"Kinjo is my fav for fancy sushi close to home.   I dislike their take on some of the simpler rolls so I usually go for special rolls here but they all involve tempura and often garnished with mayo so going here is a treat for me to want to go in.   The one major complaint with Kinjo is they put Miso on the vegetarian list and you might assume there is no fish, but their miso is fish based and it doesn't indicate otherwise.   I've never waited for a table here even though it often seems quite full.  It's  a major attraction for celebrations and they will bring the staff out to sing and that can happen several times during any meal so it's not a quite evening out.  There are staff dedicated to entertainment called pocky men.  They bring pocky to the ladies and children and will try to embarrass the guys.   I like pocky so this acceptable for me but if it wasn't for pocky or if I was a guy that doesn't get pocky then I might be annoyed by this."}
{"text":"I've had really good melt in your mouth sushi and okay Calgary sushi.  Kinjo is just okay sushi, but what makes me give this place one star is the bad customer service from the owner Peter Kinjo himself.  One star is the minimum otherwise I would give it 1/2 star.  Tonight we ordered the giant platter for takeout and after tasting the tuna, I knew it was bad.  It had a really fishy taste and left a bad after taste in your mouth.  I had to down lots of ginger to get rid of it.  What shocked me was the customer service I got when I called to tell them about it.  The supervisor lady I talked to at first was nice; she apologized for it and offered to refund my money in full.  I hung up and got ready to give my son a bath.  They called us back and talked to my husband about 7 minutes later.  They want me to bring the left over sushi back to them so they can see it for themselves.  He told them we live far away and if they want, they can send someone to pick it up themselves.  They said they were busy so the general manager was supposed to call us back.  At 7:15 (about 8 minutes later) the general manager called back and told me I had to bring back the sushi so they can see and taste it.  He said \"we make it fresh in the morning and are busy throughout the day so the sushi shouldn't be bad and you are the only one today complaining about it.  Please bring it back and if we made a mistake we will do anything you want.\"  I told him I had to put my son to bed and will be there in about 45 mins.  When I got to Kinjo to return the sushi, the supervisor took it to the back and had the head chef try it.  He confirmed it was unsuitable.  The supervisor came back to me and was on her cell phone with someone and told me we are willing to take 50% off.  I told her that I was told they would refund me the whole amount if they confirmed the sushi was bad.  She went away talking on the cell phone with someone and came back and offered me her cell phone and said \"do you want to talk to Peter, the owner?\"  When I got on the phone he said \"What do you want young lady?  I can only give you 50% off, when you order take out and when you eat at the restaurant it's different, I cannot refund you the entire amount.\"  I told him there's no difference if I eat at the restaurant or take out; if the sushi is bad then it's bad.  He told me that I'm the only one who complained today and no one else has.  I told him I know what good sushi should taste like and what I got was bad, even your chef confirmed it.  I told him I wanted a full refund because that's what I was promised, but by then you can tell he was starting to lose it, he raise his voice and kept interrupting me.  I told him I've come here on other occasions and ordered the same for takeout but may not do so in the future.  What surprised me was his response, \"I don't need you either young lady. \"  I told him \"don't think just because you're busy it's okay to treat one customer like me this way, I've seen you before and thought you were a nice person but now I really know how you are and how you deal with customers, I won't be coming back here for sure.\"  His response was, \"I don't need you either and I'm busy right now at a function so I can't talk about it but if you want to call me back tomorrow I can talk about it with you.\"  I really can't believe the owner, Peter Kinjo, of such an establishment would be so rude and unprofessional, as well lose his cool.  In the end they only refunded me half of what I paid and I had to drive all the way back there and home and waste my time.  The sushi at this place is mediocre and poorly put together, the pieces fall apart when you pick them up."}
{"text":"Love this place! Way more space than the macleod location. Sorry Andre :)"}
{"text":"Very good sushi. Awesome staff and a great menu. Free pocky for the ladies."}
{"text":"Huge Fan. Customer service excellence meets great sushi and fun atmosphere. A must for a first date."}
{"text":"I wish Yelp allowed ten stars! This place is absolutely amazing! My boyfriend and I were seated and loved the menu! The way everything was numbered with pictures made it fun to pick out some sushi plates! Then our server brought up a complimentary plate to try some new options! I LOVED THAT! We actually changed our order and added some of the new things we had sampled! Next a man came up and offered me a box of pocky sticks, my waiter told the man it was our first time he left and came back with a big box of these different almond crunch pocky sticks all complimentary! this made my whole night and made this a place I will be regularly! P.s the sweet soy sauce is amazing and the volcano rolls are to die for!"}
{"text":"When I was a little boy, I hoped to one day be surrounded by fat Japanese men prancing around and singing Happy Birthday to me. I was always the special kid in class.  Today, my childhood dream has finally been fulfilled. I came to Kinjo Sushi to celebrate my uncle's birthday, and after reading all the good reviews about this place, I had high expectations walking into this Japanese themed restaurant. The atmosphere is a traditional Japanese building, set with cherry blossom paintings and samurai swords. Even the waiters were dressed in traditional Japanese attire.. that was a good laugh!!  I'm not a sushi connoisseur, but I can say that the sushi was delicious. We ordered the shrimp tempura, mango sushi rolls, spider rolls, fried tofu, and unagi rolls, all of which were tasty. Everyone at our table swept clean every single piece of rice and caviar on the plates.  Our waitress was very quick and personable. Our orders came out incredibly fast (the chefs must be sushi masters!!), but our food was not prepared in haste. All of our rolls were rolled tightly, and the rice did not fall apart when we grabbed them. And boy, I ate my fried tempura faster than a ninja could throw his shuriken. (yes I went there..)   However, it wasn't just our waitress who was looking after our table. Another member of the management came and asked us how our food tasted and handed out free Pocky. Let me repeat that: Free Pocky!! At that point I exploded a little with a small burst of happiness and shamelessly snatched my Strawberry Pocky, shoving all the wafers in my mouth in less than 3 seconds. Do not judge me.  In the end, the service was great, the atmosphere was enjoyable, and the sushi was delicious as always. I will definitely come back to Kinjo Sushi and Grill Restaurant.. this place is out of this world!!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, I've been to Kaiten Sushi places in Tokyo & Kyoto.  Yes, I understand that its really not a fair comparison.    Kinjo seems to be a fairly popular place.  I've been a few times, mostly for dinner, but once for lunch.  The Host(ess) are friendly enough and I've never had to wait in line to get a seat.  The best part of Kaiten Sushi is that the minute you sit down, you can be eating as the boats with the plates of sushi just roll on past you.  The waiter/waitresses are less than attentive and even though there seems to be a pile of them at the various stations.  The time it takes for them to get you what you want is anything but prompt.  I usually ask for low sodium shoyu.  Typically I'll wait 5+ minutes.  I have also asked for Green tea and water, again... it takes much longer than I think it should based on the number of restaurant patrons to wait staff ratio.  They are definitely not short staffed here.  Especially considering you serve yourself.    The food rolls past you on the boats.  Great if you don't know what you want, as you can select sushi on the fly.  My only complaint with Kinjo is that they will only have about 5-6 varieties out at a time.  California roll, spicy tuna roll, salmon sushi, tuna sushi, and maybe a tomago.  once one of those selections gets depleted then they put something else out.  Yes, you can ask for something special.  Again, its the wait time that comes into play.  The sushi is good, but I wouldn't call it stellar.    The staff are friendly enough and the last time I was there, my friends were offered up a box of Pocky.  A nice gesture on Kinjo's part.    Considering that Kinjo in in the middle of the prairies,  in a land locked province.  I give them full credit for making a go at Kaiten Sushi.    Cons  Offer up more choices on the sushi belt, get the staff to focus on customer service instead of texting their friends, and you'll definitely go up a star.    Pros Friendly staff, Solid standard and fresh sushi, reasonable prices.  I'll go back, but given the choice, I'd rather go to Tokyo and eat there."}
{"text":"My favourite place for sushi, a ton of items to choose from and a bunch of vegetarian options. I recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Two words..... Ah! Mazing!   Went for dinner last night after some shopping with my sister. When we walked in we almost left because there were so many people waiting but decided to put our name on the list. I don't know how they did it but only 15 minutes later we were shown to our seat, then the real fun began.  This place has a HUGE menu! We chose the dynamite roll, Philadelphia roll, mango roll, nacho sushi, crispy California roll and shrimp and calamari tempura. I always find it challenging to order the right amount off a checklist type menu as I proved again this time. There was so much food! The only thing that was not fantastic was the shrimp tempura as they were slightly soggy. Everything else was fresh and delicious and we ate as much as we could and both of us ended up taking left-overs home.   I can't wait to try the other locations but if they aren't as good I will drive from my house in the far South to eat here again because it was just THAT GOOD!"}
{"text":"fairly priced 4 Good quality sashimi 5 The rolls are horrible tho 2 Grills are great for its price 5 Services are pretty good , they were pretty quick !"}
{"text":"I hated sushi that I've tried. Then I met a girl.   Now, after Kinjo...I like sushi. The service is great. The food...awesome. I don't like all the sushi, but the price vs quality is great. And sake.....YUM.   Always friendly, always delicious. Give the men Pocky too. I'm the one picking up the bill, and want nom noms."}
{"text":"Been eating here for years and surprised I haven't posted a review yet, I love this place, my kids love this place, food is always consistent, service is great, and other than sushi, you must try the Black Cod, Avocado tempura, special scallops, and gomaa, everything here is great! I will be their regular for years to come."}
{"text":"This place was great!  As I travel the world for work, I have a little bit of unique take on the service industry since I'm frequently a lone American female diner.  By far, this was the best customer service I've had in a long time.  I often get ignored or forgotten as I don't tend to draw any attention to myself, but multiple servers greeted me and checked on me throughout my meal, including the owner.  The free sample plate of sushi was great, as I was starving after a long day at work.  It didn't taste like it had been sitting in the cooler forever either, which is frankly what I expected when it was put on the table.  By the way, they have two single tables very close to the center of the restaurant which was very reassuring and noticed immediately - that alone was worth a nice tip since I get tired of being stuck near the kitchen.  There were lots of things going on - it stayed very busy but not obnoxiously loud, and I was never bored throughout the meal.  The owner was hilarious, and told me to come back with my boyfriend - when I explained I was only here for work from the USA and single, he immediately started flirting and calling for more free food!  He said in his restaurant he always made sure the ladies were happy - I couldn't stop laughing!  And the free Pocky once I finished eating was awesome.  I had the Okinawa Roll and the Black Rock Roll by the way (since I reckon I should talk about the food a little) and the taste was good, fish wasn't overpowered by sauce, and the mango was fresh.  The rice was cooked well and the rolls were tight and cut to be perfectly mouth-sized.   Nothing is perfect, so I think the two things I would mention that were less than perfect are:  1) that the ginger/wasabi plate you get is the super cheap stuff and really dry so if you like to eat either with your meal, don't expect much and 2) I was a little disappointed by the lack of variation in plain ol' fish, but then again, I'm in a landlocked province in Canada so I guess that isn't terrible.  I know I'm spoiled when I'm home down in south Florida!    Summary - great job with this restaurant, especially if it's truly a chain.  Keep up that customer service;  I'll probably be back again this week before I leave for home!  Edit:  Went back tonight and it was great again!  Forgot to mention that my servers were Jennifer and Queenie - super awesome gals!"}
{"text":"Kinjo was definitely a fun experience - different than any other I've had at a sushi restaurant in Calgary thus far.   We headed out on a Thursday night, yet it was still pretty busy. However, if you don't request to sit at a table, they can usually seat you at the bar pretty quickly - there was no wait for us.  There's sushi floating around on boats at the bar, which is supercool. You are welcome to take one straight from the boats if you know what you're doing. We weren't sure you were allowed at first (and it wasn't quite explained) so we opted to order from the menu instead.   They bring you a little sampler plate to start, which was great - we got to try a few new things (although I've confirmed that I just don't like salmon *sadface*) and Peter, the owner, came around to give everyone their complimentary box of Pocky. He's quite the character, asking couples to reaffirm their love for each other and having the entire staff break out into song. He was only around for about the first half hour of our meal, though - not sure if he took off for the evening or went to the other (newer) location.  The sushi was excellent, as was the chicken teryaki. The two types of soy sauce was also a neat addition. My least favourite roll was the Kinjo Roll (unfortunately) but all in all I very much enjoyed the meal. The sake was nice and strong, although it's odd that 5 oz was $4,50 and 10oz was $9... would expect a small price break for the bigger amount?  The one thing that really threw the evening off was that they never removed the plates. It wouldn't ordinarily be a big deal but on a surface as small as the bar was, they got in the way very fast, especially if you have someone sitting on either side of you. I get (now) that it has to do with counting how much sushi you've eaten from the menu and the bar, but I can't help but wonder if there's a better way. Either way, I'd definitely request a table next time since I'm not likely to take right off the boats anyhow.  Will definitely be back to Kinjo - a very awesome experience and fun place to go."}

I've been to Kinjo once before and the first thing I noticed was how big it was on the inside - definitely not what you'd expect from how it looks from the outside. It has a very open layout, really comfy chairs and just the right amount of light - not too dark or bright.  What I like about this sushi place compared to others I've been to is that they always bring you some samples before you order - love that touch.  And, as is the standard at Kinjo, at the end of the dinner, if you're there with a girl (which I was), one of the male servers will bring a box of Pocky for her to have.  As I mentioned, I came here for Nadine's birthday which I told our waitress about 3/4 of the way through our meal. Nadine is shy when the spotlight is on her so I was looking forward to seeing what they would - well they got pretty much all of their staff over to our table to sing her Happy Birthday complete with some bongos.  What I wasn't expecting was after they sang to her, they made me sing a song to her - luckily they sang along with me!  All in all, it was a great time and the price is pretty good compared to other sushi places I've been to. Would definitely recommend if you live in the NW :)"}
{"text":"I've been here several times now, and each time the sushi has always been fresh and tasty, with innovative presentation for some of the rolls (e.g. the dragon combos). Peter Kinjo knows how to imbue the place with personality, which he exudes in spades (watch out for the knife!). Sashimi is A+ and the spicy squid rolls (not on the main menu) are terrific. Great food, great atmosphere, and lineups out the door on Friday and Saturday. Hint: it's not just because of the free Pocky."}
{"text":"I really do love this place ever since they first opened this location! My family and I love to come here because it is always great food and service!   As soon as you walk in, you get greeted with a friendly welcome in Japanese! The wait to get seated it usually really short and they always bring you samples of sushi rolls so that you can try some out before ordering. This also helps curb your hunger until the food comes which is really nice!   I love their small plates because you get to try out several things rather than one huge roll (although their large rolls are nice too). They have a new bluefin tuna menu that's is seriously awesome!!! They didn't have all of the things on it available all the time but I did get to try out their fatty toro nigiri and which is amazing! I can't even - just go try it! Haha   Their special sashimi or their beef tataki is also something I love getting as well.   In terms of large rolls, the vegetarian roll is yummy with the avocado on top and tempura yam inside combo - the strawberry on top of the whole thing just makes it that much better. I would also recommend the mango roll with the shrimp tempura inside! I personally don't love the fried rolls but that's probably just a me thing because my friend loves them.   Overall, the price is pretty reasonable compared to other places and you can count on the food being fresh as well. Would recommend a visit for sure! Also if you come on your birthday - the servers will all sing for you haha"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. This isn't even sushi anymore. How do you fuck up ootoro? The pieces were falling apart, were discolored, and looked days old. The spicy tuna sushi looked like someone squeezed paste out of a tube. I've been to some shitty parts of the world and I've rather have the food that gave me gastroenteritis than eat here again."}
{"text":"Last Saturday, my boyfriend took me to CF Chinook Centre Mall to go shopping. Before that, we had sushi at Kinjo Sushi & Grill restaurant for the lunch.The restaurant is located 5 mins away from the CF Chinook Centre Mall. It was our first time having Sushi in the city of Calgary and also 1st time came to this restaurant. It's a middle size of the restaurant. We arrived the restaurant right after it opened. The restaurant is very clean and tidy. Servers and Cooks were very nice and friendly. The restaurant is divided by two different parts, Dining Table and Sushi Boat Bar. People can either order the dishes or take sushi from the sushi bar. We decided to sit at the sushi bar. The cooks made different sushi rolls in front of us and then put them on the Boat. The Sushi Boats run circles in front of the us. We could pick the different sushi rolls from different Boats.  The sushi rolls came fast. They were fresh, tasty, and delicious. We paid by different colors of plate. The red plate is  $3.60 each. The yellow is  $4.10 each. The green one is $5.50. The food here was all in the small portions, but there were so many selections. It's great. We love this place so much. Highly recommend people to try KINJO Sushi & Grill. I am sure that we will come back here again in so soon. Great food and Great customers service. !"}
{"text":"I just had dinner here. Baaaad service! A server called Nari, sooo bad service. I asked for low sodium soy sauce, she forgot it. I asked for wasabi, forgot again. She even forgot one special roll I ordered! After we done everything, she served it even we asked for cancel it. Won't go to Kinjo any more!"}
{"text":"Edited Apr 13/2014 - No more brown rice.  :o(  Visited Kinjo today and found out that the restaurant now has Brown Rice Sushi for an additional 10% more for the price of the menu item.  I'm happy to have found a sushi place that serves brown rice.  Yay!  The food is always good here.  Wait service was a bit scattered.  He gave me the wrong bill and then forgot to give me my visa receipt after he asked me if I wanted one.  Go figure!"}
{"text":"Yes, it is a chain sushi joint but try it anyway! The sushi is amazing and the menu selection is really great.  They usually have some little sample to bring to the table.  They treat customers very well, and even have a special treat for the ladies after the meal- Poki sticks!  By far the best chain of sushi restaurants.  Plus it is a very fun place for birthday dinner, because the staff will all come and sing.  You don't get that at very many places anymore, and it's really fun!"}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars.  Just did pickup after a long day being out on the road, and wanted something quick and easy, so after yelping it, I just didn't read enough...thought it would be authentic or izakaya (ok, that's pushing it lol).  It's a huge restaurant but small portions, then again, pretty cheap, gets 4 star for value.  Though the cali roll was just 4 pcs, it was good enough, and the deep fried tempura/avocado wasn't too shabby too,    Extra star for offering a mini-box version of Pocky lol.  Friendly service.  Loses a star for using pink ginger!"}
{"text":"Come to this place thanks to my friend's suggestion. We got complimentary sushi rolls, which I didn't expect, so that was good. We also got free Pockys... this was very unique since other places would give mints or candies... :) The sushi we ordered was tasty."}
{"text":"Totally picked this placed based on the number of reviews! We weren't disappointed! Place was busy, the food was fresh, service was fast and the prices very reasonable! Def will be back again for more."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this Kinjo location in a long time because their sushi was slacking. As I was in the area today and had an craving for some cheap and fast sushi, I stopped into Kinjo. Their service was always great and friendly... and still is! The food now is simply yummy, just like their Dalhousie location. The rice wasn't falling apart like it did before. Everything tasted fresh and yummy. Very impressed with the way they make their food now."}
{"text":"The sushi was amazing! The fish felt like it melts in your mouth. We were seated and you check of the list what items and how many you'd like. The servers here are really on top of it if you need help with anything. The servers are incredibly friendly, like to make you feel at home. There was someone going around passing pocky sticks out and they're for free, free is always great. The decor inside is very nice too. I'd recommend this place, they have pick up as well as skip the dishes service too."}
{"text":"Busy busy busy. Must be good ...  good atmosphere, hustle and general vibe.  To be fair I went at 9:30 close to last call.  The suhi was messi, not well built and lacking in presentation.  To make up for it, there was good hosting, a fun vibe (seemed very young folks), and inexpensive sushi which allowed for a very large sampling without breaking the wallet"}
{"text":"I went to place last night and I was surprised in how good it was. The service was good, people were happy and the food was perfect. If you love sushi and you are stopping in Calgary I highly suggest this place."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best sushi places we have tried since moving to Calgary.  Jo who is a waiter is so funny and friendly.  They give you sample plates when you arrive and you leave with a box of Pocky.    The food was amazing.  We got a seat right away and our food was delivered with in min of ordering.  I will be going back to Kinjo for sure."}
{"text":"I LOVE KINJO!!! Definitely one of my favorite sushi places. After reading the great reviews on Yelp I decided to give this location a try, since it's right near my house. Since then I have been back 5+ times. Each time the food is delicious. Yes, it does get a little annoying to hear the same banter every time you go. And yes, you do not want to go for your first date here (awkward...). However, the wine is delicious and VERY inexpensive, the menu is HUGE - there is literally something for everyone (OYSTERS! Yum), and the service is wonderful. It is busy pretty much anytime you go, but I've never had to wait longer than 3 minutes for a table. Usually the servers are very attentive. I especially love the plate of various rolls they bring you when you sit down! It's fun to try the different options and I'm usually SO hungry so I enjoy the quick bite before I decide what I want. I love that they offer the sweet soya sauce (I previously swore off every sushi place except Sushi Boat because I hate regular soya sauce!) And of course, the free Pocky is a really nice touch, I even got a box when I bought my sister a gift certificate from here for her birthday. They also offer sushi making classes, which I think is a really neat idea. I will absolutely be back to Kinjo, again and again!!"}
{"text":"Not the best sushi I've ever had but for the price it was pretty good! It's a fun but loud atmosphere for date night with the boats going around the bar to pick your plates off of. And bonus at the end! The girls get a choice of picky! YUM!"}
{"text":"Very average sushi joint. No wild salmon was a definitive killer for me. Not coming back anytime soon unless they add that option. Farmed salmon (or any fish) is a definite no-no."}
{"text":"I have only been to this Kinjo location the 1 time and I have to say it's one of my favorites. Everything from the service to the price to the quality of food makes it top notch in my books. If I have a complaint it's that I like it considerably more than the Kinjo nearest to me and that means a trip across the city when I have the craving. I know it's gonna sound silly, but a huge selling point for me is that they have sweet soya sauce. I have only found this at one other place and that alone is reason to come back. 29/30"}
{"text":"This is probably the only place we have sushi in Calgary. We like to go in or order over skip the dishes. The sushi is always very fresh and tasty. Iv has a lot on the menu and have had no issues. It all is so delicious. Service is very good in the restaurant and even on busy nights you get fast service."}
{"text":"Free pocky! Automatic one star. Weekend evenings are insanely busy - expect 20 - 40 min waits. When you finally do get to be seated though, the good service is fast. Unlike the south location, the menu is plentiful. They always have a special menu for the season and it's good to switch up the normal items for something new.  True to the Kinjo chains, they will gather and sing happy birthday to you on your birthday, if you request it.   I have been here on occasions where the fish is fresh and occasions when it's just so-so. Where in times they lack in food quality they overwhelm you with intrusive customer service.  Every meal I have had here has been satisfactory or plus, which means you really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Even Wasabi sushi is better in their quality. Kinjo went down sometimes from the time Peter Kinjo was there."}
{"text":"I used to frequent here until I found a pubic hair in my sushi. Macleod trail is not as good as Deep south and a little pricey per dish. Have had better."}
{"text":"Andre, you totally made this a five-star night.   Andre is the name of the staff member who came along halfway through our meal with some packages of Pocky and got my best friend to tell me what a wonderful friend I am! A few minutes before, he lead the staff in song to a couple who was in the restaurant for their anniversary. It's like Red Robin's meet a sushi bar.  I was impressed we got in so quickly for a Saturday night. I think the sushi bar that wrapped itself all the way around Kinjo may have helped in the expediency at which people ate their food. It's not really set up for long talks after you've eaten your meal, not that I felt rushed or pressured to leave at any point. Note-there are tables available as well if there are more than two of you. But definitely give the bar a try if you're willing.  The sushi itself was on par with being good quality yet inexpensive. The menu boasts a selection of what Kinjo refers to as \"red, yellow or green plate\" options. The servers are friendly, the food is fresh and served in a decent amount of time. We ordered the spider roll, a spicy tuna roll, avocado roll, rainbow roll and salmon sashimi. The spider roll was most definitely the largest and most colourful, and one my best friend was the most willing to eat (she's not so much a fan of the raw fish concept).   The real draw for Kinjo is definitely the atmosphere. It was so happy and fun! And I carried the Pocky around in my purse to nibble on for a couple of days afterwards. Thanks for the treat!"}
{"text":"This is the most fun & crazy sushi joint in Alberta. In addition to the typical rotating sushi boat, the staff sing birthday songs, hand out Pocky candy & generally have. a good time.  And the sushi is fresh & tasty too."}
{"text":"Have come here twice now and its a very busy noisy fun place !  We like to sit at the sushi bar and pick the little colored dishes as they go by.  Our favorite is the Female dragon roll and we've had it every time we come.  Peter swings by with the Pocky treats for the girls and kids and is very friendly.   We always enjoy ourselves and the atmosphere here is fun.  Everyone looks like they are having a good time !"}
{"text":"great service, i highly recommend the mango roll very good. there a guy named andre that is very friendly and always walkin around giving free samples n talkin with ppl. IF you tell them you are from out of town you get a special greetings as well. very clean and pretty good price. for desert i like the pear ice cream or something like that. will def come back when im in town"}
{"text":"Fun fun fun. Much smaller than the dalhousie location BUT it's got the rotating sushi boat so I actually prefer this one. Fresh sushi, quick service (grab and eat) & surprisingly good uni. forgot to give me pocky at the end though there goes that 1 star. Good choice for a pre-movie meal, get in and out quick!"}
{"text":"Good sushi. Friendly staff. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"All the reviews had 5 stars for this restaurant so I had to stop by and give it a try.  They didn't take any reservations so I was hesitant to go because I didn't want to wait 40 mins to eat.  When I called they informed me that it was only going to be about 10 mins wait and indeed it was despite being the 10th name on the list.    The atmosphere was very similar to a lounge, much like Joey's Tomato.  The service was extra speedy, hence the short waiting time.  As soon as we sat down, we were greeted with free samples of rolls and ginger beef.  Very cool, who wouldn't want free food right?   Our server was running back and forth as if there was a prize to win for the fastest server.  Our food came out really fast and it didn't tasted like it was pre-made so that was a relief.  They had a lot of small, appetizer dishes so you won't have a problem with choices and the prices are really reasonable for sushi; although the tataki dishes are much pricier compared to the rest of the menu.    Their sashimi slices are extra thick so definitely the best bang for your buck.  I don't think there was a dish that stuck out for me but if I had to choose then it would be the beef tataki.  Unfortunately  there wasn't enough beef...hehe..but the sauce was exceptional and the slices were considerably thin.  Their low price margin attracts a lot of customers and their owner walks around and interacts with everyone which I think was a clever business plan, making them extremely busy.    Overall, my experience was pleasant and the food quality was decent.  Good enough for me to come back because service was very prompt and prices are probably the cheapest in town when it comes to sushi so can't go wrong with that.:)"}
{"text":"Always great food delivered quickly. It's a regular stop for us thanks to the quality."}
{"text":"Kinjo is very busy but very friendly, they seem to always do their best to get you seated as quick as they can. Sushi was pretty good, most great. I found that a couple of the rolls looked like they were slapped together...but this could be expected on a busy Sunday afternoon.  As a side note it is very hard to order off the menu and not also steal some off of the boats as you wait. all in all a good place for some tasty sushi."}
{"text":"This has been a classic for me for years! I love the food and fast service. Quality of service is not always the best, and has gone down hill for the past couple years."}
{"text":"I don't know anything about sushi. That's just a fact. So if you're a sushi enthusiast with pictures of spicy tuna rolls adorning the walls of your home or a special pair of \"sushi chopsticks\" that you polish on the weekends, you might have a bone to pick with me.  I was invited out for sushi a few nights ago. My response was a knee jerk, \"Ah, I'm not really a sushi guy, but I'm down to try.\" See, I was basing that statement on one bad experience I had with sushi where avocado goop squirted all over my mouth and made me want to barf. But let's move on, because Kinjo did none of those things.  We were seated promptly and soon green tea arrived. In the meantime I enjoyed a chorus of Japanese guys singing happy birthday for what felt like roughly 5 minutes in all sorts of different keys. It wasn't annoying though, it was endearing, like I imagine your kid making you breakfast in bed would be if the breakfast was actually only plastic fruits from a toy set. That sort of feeling.  ... I don't have kids. So I can't say that from experience. Anyways..  We ordered what can likely be called the \"white man's sushi\" mix - Volcano Rolls, Yam rolls, Philedelphia rolls (I think?) and some other incredibly non-threatening sushi types. We also got yam tempura and asparagus.  A little while later a nice boy in a red suit came around to ask if we wanted Pocky sticks for dessert. Well, of course we did, except he made the lovely woman I was having sushi with work really hard to get them after she asked if we could have two boxes. See, that's sort of a faux pas, though not totally out of the question. So in response to her boldness, he gave her the bricks and made her -GASP- kiss me on the cheek - before handing over the goods. Well hats off to you, pocky stick boy. Thanks to you I later got compliments on my smooth skin.   Back to the food.  It was delicious, and I'm \"not a sushi guy\". It wasn't too fishy. The volcano rolls were a major highlight because I'm a big fan of a little spice. The yam tempura was delicious too, and the yam rolls were great.   Service was excellent despite being incredibly busy. It was a fun experience that even someone who \"isn't a sushi guy\" can really enjoy!  We capped off the night by eating our strawberry and chocolate pocky sticks at the SAME TIME to simulate chocolate raspberries. My, aren't we creative?  Answer: YES."}
{"text":"Kinjo is always busy! That must mean good things!  The parking is okay, but if its really busy, you might have to steal a parking spot next door at Wendy's.    When you first arrive in Kinjo, you are immediately greeted by the hosts at the front and if its busy, they'll ask you your name and what you prefer for seating: sushi bar, booth near the sushi bar, or table.  I prefer the booth near the sushi bar, so you have a big space to eat as well you can grab whatever you like from the boats and also have some privacy.  Spence and I went on a Sunday, around 7:30PM and of course there was a line.  We waited about ~20 minutes to get a booth at the sushi bar and when you get seated, you receive a sample of some sushi which is nice.  The menu is pretty big and there's a lot to choose from, but don't forget the sushi bar!  We ordered tea with some miso soup and salad to start, then some shrimp tempura which has nice, light batter and decided to just pick and choose from the sushi bar.  Dont forget that each plate has a different cost!  Plates: Red ($3.25), Yellow ($3.75), Green ($4.95) and Blue ($6.25).  We found that it can add up pretty darn fast! Our bill was $55!  Our waitress was very friendly, always topping up our water and tea as well as checking up on us to see if we've got everything we want or needed anything else.  :)  Oh, and you always leave with pocky!    SIDE NOTE: If you read my review about Sakana, we think that Kinjo and Sakana are very similar.  Driving past macleod, we saw that there is going to be a new Sakana location opening right across from Kinjo...talk about competition!"}
{"text":"One of the very first times I went to a Sushi restaurant, I was hesitant because I had not tried much before but we had a pleasant surprised! Lots of different flavours and types at a good price point, and good atmosphere for sharing with friends."}
{"text":"I've been a fan since the place first opened close to 6 years ago.  The food is always exceptionally good; tasty and healthy (barring tempura of course: it's deep fried and not something I eat).  Beyond excellent fare, the service is always, always beyond compare.  The staff are friendly, gracious, accommodating, cheerful and attentive.  Domo arigato, Andre, Muchiko, Masama, TIng Ting, Anne, Rose, Fang, Steven and all the rest of the crew who take such good care of us."}
{"text":"Review: dinner.  Bottomline: family oriented Izukaya (tapas style) Japanese restaurant with a lively atmosphere that serves good quality sushi.  Atmosphere: everytime we come here it's always busy and noisy. Despite this, we always feel welcomed and well attended to. It's like we are here for a party and Kinjo is the warm host. Decor is typical of a Japanese restaurant but it's nice that half of their restaurant use booths. And make sure to mention to them if it's someone's birthday. You will be in for a treat.  Food: we frequent Kinjo and have tried a majority of dishes. Their sushi in general is quite good. Rice is cooked well and rolls are well put together. Ingredients are fresh and they have a good variety of sushi and rolls to choose from. What they falter at are their cooked food. Portions are small and none we have found stood out.  Value: like other tapas places, the price can add up quickly without you realizing. Prices are average to expensive depending on the dish. Expect to pay more than usual for a full belly."}
{"text":"Kinjo is a breath of fresh sushi, the first lungful in a long time, one I would frequent if my home wasn't 900 km away.  A lunch at Kinjo is like eating solid joy, perfectly transmitted from its owner to each table...and to think this is a chain, albeit a small one.  Only three Kinjos exist, scattered like buckshot across the city of Calgary, validating the appeal of the décor, the quality of its sushi, and the passion of its owner.    I know I'm long past my obligation for an opening joke, something involving the inner workings of my gastro-intestinal system or perhaps a remark a passing reader may mistaken as faintly racist.  Truth is, right beside my computer, I have a Thunderdome-like Aunty's wheel I spin to determine the bizarre pop-culture references I'll have to drop during the course of a review.  My initial attempt landed on Silence of the Lambs, which I've touched on three times already.  A second fell on Pink Floyd's laser concert which...okay, I've honestly no idea why that's there.  So perhaps I'll just do this one review serious, respectful, honoring the zeal of Kinjo's owner, a man with enough faith in this restaurant that he named it after himself.   That's right, Peter Kinjo, and that's a name that should be familiar.    You're right, it's not, but that's why I'm here.   To know the restaurant and to properly understand the enthusiasm of the owner I personally encountered that day, I feel compelled to take a moment to educate those reading this.  Peter was one of the founders of the massive Edo Japan chain of fast-food sushi eateries literally infecting every single mall and airport from Vancouver to Saskatoon.  Although now amounting to over a hundred locations, Peter no longer earns anything from them.  He sold his shares, made a few unwise economic decisions after, and came to Calgary to try something new, to move away from the fast-food sushi and take a crack at an actual restaurant.  He went about this by replicating a restaurant model seldom seen in Canada, something known as Kaiten-zushi.  This is where the sushi is presented on a conveyer belt which orbits the bar where patrons sit, some on stools, some around connected tables.  I encountered this in China and lamented its absence in my travels about Canada.    Well, bemoan no more because Kinjo has gone one better.  To hell with cheap conveyer belts like we're at the end run of a tired Lucile Ball comedy sketch, bring on the boats!  What better way to deliver food than on a boat.  Some restaurants have platters shaped as boats; I'm not talking about that.  These are actual seaworthy boats on a channel of water, chained together and carried along by current induced from vents below the surface.  Sushi delivered via flotation device, seriously the only way this could be cooler is if the whole was put against a backdrop of Laser Floyd (heh).  Unlike the fluorescent Teletubbie explosion I ate inside of in Guangzhou, Kinjo is slightly more restrained, reserving its energy for its animated owner as he organizes a birthday chorus for a table when he hands out complimentary Pocky to random kids at tables.  This guy is pure class, navigating around the customers and employees ensuring everyone is seen to.  I know restaurant owners responsible for twenty seats that don't do this, and Kinjo has over sixty...and three locations.  No wonder this guy made a million in his first year.  No wonder he turns tables eight times over on a busy weekday.  Of course, this would all be irrelevant if the sushi was substandard.  Thankfully, it didn't disappoint.  One especially brilliant special order, known as the kissing dragons, involved two complete rolls, a rainbow and an eel, made to resemble Asian snake-like dragons, even going so far to include head-pieces with roe-eyes and vegetable whiskers.    Now that being said, I guess I should find fault.  Despite attempts to make it operate more like a restaurant, it's by no means a high-class sushi-ya.  Like a Trek holodeck, behind the lights and colors, the motions of a fast-food joint can still be found...but it's a very well made illusion, one I was more than willing to look past.  And the formula as it stands obviously works like gangbusters.  Kinjo's namesake restaurant reflects his devotion.  He obviously eats and sleeps his business.  He's doing what he loves and I hope that until he decides to retire, he and his restaurants continue to find success.   Food:  4/5 Service:  3.5/5 Presentation:  4/5 Value:  5/5 Recommendation:  4/5"}
{"text":"Wow!  My husband took me here for Valentine's dinner, we had a 20 min wait for a table but it was totally worth it. Very clean, lots of seating, huge open kitchen with the most sushi chefs I've ever seen at one time.  Our drink order was taken quickly and a sample plate of four pieces of rolls given to us.  The menu is big but it's all photos of every dish and piece of sushi..I had a hard time deciding.  Our food came in a timmley manner and plates were somewhat spaced out which was great.  Don't expect your entire order of sushi to come out all at the same time, they pace it and check it off a list by your table.  I recommend the Dragon love roll which is the male and female Dragon rolls together. There was even a Pocky girl that came by and gave me some chocolate pocky sticks!  Nice touch! I can't wait to go back and try different rolls and sushi...So many to choose from."}
{"text":"First time eating at the Macleod Branch. The servers are very attentive and serve food with a smile. I like the unagi sushi, mango roll and the squid. I enjoyed drinking their green tea. Everything is fresh and prepared with care. Waiting time is good too. The place has a good ambiance and very clean. I recommend it to anybody who enjoys Sushi."}
{"text":"Great food.  Quick service.  Awesome atmosphere. Peter is great.  Always good food at a great price"}
{"text":"Kinjo serves its function well. It is fast, good and extremely well priced. Not to mention the service is always on point.   I wouldn't say that the overall quality of sushi is the best in Calgary, but for the price it cannot be beat."}
{"text":"I went there last year to visit my sister and we went to this restaurant and the host knew i was just visiting and he called his crew and sang me songs and that was a surprise for me. Feels like home! For the food, i love the baby octopus and magic steak"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery, and the service and food are really good! Recommend it for takeouts or delivery."}
{"text":"I think of sushi as being a small and intimate deal but this place is huge. They have a big open kitchen packed with loads of people to bang out all the sushi, deep fried stuff and other stuff. It's a good intro to sushi for kids with lots of options and those weirdos who are afraid to eat sushi will be pleased to find lots of alternatives. I prefer a quieter and more intimate experience."}
{"text":"I have had a tattered history with this sushi bar: as the white husband of an Asian, I am a highly visible target for Peter's gregarious teasing, especially on a slower day. He came to the table with his giant knife and demanded embarrassing things, then told Kat that \"maganda, you're too good for this guy!\" All in good fun, I am sure, but as a couple who prefer to eat in peace, it was quite offputting, and I hadn't been back there in a few years.  Kat, Kyla, my mother-in-law and I came here for dinner on Family Day, and if we were looking for peace, we surely did not get it: there was a 25-minute wait to get in (after we'd phone and they told us it wasn't busy, but its first come first serve), and the place was bustling like gangbusters. We eventually got a place right on the floating sushi bar, a new experience for me. Being the first time with this experience, I was delighted: plates of delicious sushi floating right past me, and I grab whatever I pleased. It took a couple of minutes to get over the uncertainty (maybe they are for someone?), and after that it was all downhill.   Orders of gyoza and tempura, smoked salmon and California rolls, unagi and a mango-salmon-tempura roll: by the end of it all, we have 17 plates stacked in front of us, but thankfully the price wasn't as sky-high as I'd feared. More importantly for a lazer-quick sushi bar, the fish was very fresh and incredibly edifying: we were all sated and rubbing our tummies with a big smile.  Peter was absent, and in his place was a less irritating guy named Andre: he came around all smiles and shouts, and only asked me to hug Kat. Phew! At one point the staff started singing Happy Birthday to a patron, and during the applause I let out an Erick-style war yelp. It must have cut through because the entire place went silent, and in a moment straight out of Dumb and Dumber, Kat pointed to me like Lloyd pointed to Harry. Bit of a personal embarrassment, but I got a box of Pocky sticks out of it, for being \"a crazy guy,\" because they \"love crazy guys\"....most likely because Peter would fire them otherwise! All in all, I would recommend this place as a great location to get some great sushi, but be warned of being put on the spot."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here on a casual date. I loved it. the food was good (the green tea ice cream was amazing) Although it was pretty busy when i got in there, the food and portions were great and needless to say we had a great evening with full bellies"}
{"text":"Very noisy. Tiny tables. Rice used for roll has no flavor. The wasabi has corn starch or something in it to thin it out. Rolls aren't fresh, are made ahead of time. Sashimi is fresh and fairly good. Everything cooked is extremely salty."}
{"text":"Kinjo's sushi is not going to win any awards but if you come with female companions they would love the fact that they receive gifts, every time.   The menu is diverse, which is the nice thing about Kinjo."}
{"text":"Great service, great environment and great food. The trifecta.  Went in on a whim for some sashimi. I've avoided it before as it struck me as being expensive, but it's not. I got three orders of sashimi not realizing the large size of the pieces. It was a very good value. We received 4 pieces of free sushi to taste test. The tea pot was kept full and a great deal of food was had for under $40.00.  This is relatively high end sushi at price that's not much more than what you'd find in a food court. I can't wait to try some of the other specials."}
{"text":"Sad to say the last to visits to Kinjo have been very disappointing.  Service was brutal (mixed up orders, very slow, miserable staff) and the food was just blah.  The rice was poorly seasoned, rolls were all very bland and the sashimi was on the brown side of ripe."}
{"text":"Kinjo is our go-to for a regular sushi meal.  When we don't want the full authentic Japanese experience.  It's decent and service is pretty good.  I'm a huge fan of the pictures in the menu as they entice me and help me to decide what I want.  I always get the grilled calamari as it's tasty.  Their rolls are a decent size and they are always enough for my boyfriend and I to share.  They also have a nice selection of hot entrees and appetizers.    Of course the Pocky treats are a childhood memory for me so I always enjoy getting them.  Sometimes on their weekend evenings they have someone coming around and trying to be sociable with the table.  Sometimes a bit annoying but usually they avoid our table :)  A great NW sushi option which also uses does take-out and Just Eat!  We will be back as always."}
{"text":"Waited 10mins for a spot at the sushi bar. Definitely was no worth the wait.  No variety or choices on boats. Only saw rolls and one plate of mackerel - which wasn't even tasty. We had to order off of menu which took about 25mins. Quality was mediocre and didn't taste fresh. The best part of the meal was the Pocky! I felt like I was in a combination of karaoke bar and Jack Astors where the servers try and humiliate their guests. It was quite annoying and sadly we won't be back."}
{"text":"Just can't give it 5... Fish is pretty good, save the *frozen* tuna sashimi- wtf? Chef's special soy wrapped hand rolls definitely the best deal- lobster roll chock full of goodness, although pre-embedded sesame seeds, for those allergic or who don't like them. Prices for sushi/sashimi/nigiri pretty steep... Only 4 pieces for small rolls, vs more common 6.  Special rolls aren't bad, fairly creative.  Didn't have the hot entrees, but they were the most reasonable priced but I don't know the sizing. Busy, but they're pretty efficient when it comes down to clearing and seating.  Did get the \"not long, 10-20 minutes\" James hong from Seinfeld, when it was more of a 30-40 minute wait.  And the hell is with only girls getting pocky? Dudes need pocky too."}
{"text":"Places change; management, menu, environment and atmosphere. I know - everyone over 40 probably realizes we are not always in control of change and sometimes it's for the better.  I've been enjoying all that Kinjo has to offer for 6 years. Both locations but generally Macleod. Judging sushi restaurants often by the sashimi Kinjo made the grade easily; melt in your mouth, cut beautifully fresh fish! The menu has expanded - great! There are more tables - fine if you don't mind tucking in your elbows and stacking plates while your eating. Service used to be personal; knowing your name, your favourite menu items. Staff looked like they had fun teasing customers in song, in gestures of affection you had to repeat to loved ones. Samples before you ordered and Pocky after your meal ended also made this restaurant unique and spirited. It's lost it's charm the last few visits. Paper stuck to our scallops, salmon that has an off-putting smell, bringing all our dishes at the exact same moment (without table space) and less sauce, smaller portions, and no one considering if we'd like a refill of water, tea or even to take plates that are about to topple off the edge if the tiny table. I've brought my partner, my family, friends and colleagues to experience the food and atmosphere over the years as there truly was something for everyone. An orange fruit monkey for the young, tataki for the seafood lover or ginger beef for the Calgarian. Unfortunately the food is no longer enough to have me coming back. Macdonaldization has come to Kinjo; get in, get out and no you do not get an adequate size table or booth if you are two people, regardless of how long you are prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! I'm not a big seafood fan and I was so happy to see they had lots of sushi options without the raw fish. It is now the only Japanese restaurant I go to. The staff are so fun and inviting, my boyfriend and I even got a song sang to us. (Plus free pocky) If you are like me and don't like anything to fishy, I highly recommend the midori roll"}
{"text":"When this place first opened I was there weekly. I brought several friends there for birthdays etc. The staff, including Peter, knew me by name. In the last two years it's gone downhill fast. I probably have been back once in the last year. On two occasions  my friend got sick from the raw oysters, almost hospital sick! On another occasion, Teriyaki meat was severed cold. Again, I ordered grilled shrimp it tasted rotten. I told the sever and the sever said that's the flavour of the sauce. I said \"No! It tastes horrible\" I ordered the scallops, which comes in the same sauce, they were fine.  Please get this place back to what it used to be!!!!!!! I haven't seen Peter in about two years, maybe he should come by for a visit!"}
{"text":"I like the place, though I do find it a little pricey.  The sushi was fresh and the concepts were well thought out.  Sashimi is properly cut as opposed to some of the HUGE slices that you would get at a more amateurish place.  Rolls were decent, and the floating delivery boats around the ovalish table is quite cute.  It reminded me a lot of some of the automated sushi snack bars I would frequent in Tokyo.  Rising from the ashes of a closed Tim Horton's (it moved a few blocks over behind an Esso), It looks like Peter Kinjo, formerly of Sakuna Grill, had a definate idea of what he wanted in his place.  Communal booths? Yep.  Intimate seating for dates. Yep.  Japanese decor? Yep. Gregarious larger than life sushi resto owner?  Definately that.    If you're wondering what I mean about that, Peter Kinjo is definately a tireless self-promoter.  Always ready with a joke or two, or a box of Pocky, he lights up a table whenever he's around to tease a diner, charm the girl or bring a laugh to a kid's face.  (I wonder if this is from his days at Sakuna since Teppanyaki chefs also tend to be jokers).  Sometimes admittedly it can be a bit much, and his pure force of personality can overwhelm a little (I ended up with 3-4 boxes at one dinner even though I HATE Pocky... but just couldn't bring myself to say no... luckily there were some kids in the resto who got extra Pocky from me as a result when his back was turned).  So overall, it's popular, and the food is good.  Parking is a little tight (not too many spaces, and it's shared with a Wendy's), and when the place is full, it can be downright claustrophobic, but overall a good place for sushi cravings. Just please... PLEASE... no more Pocky for me!!!"}
{"text":"The rolls are small and relatively pricey. The sashimi was quite fresh though but still quite pricey. I don't live here and am from the SF Bay Area and so I may just be spoiled with the good sushi."}
{"text":"Kinjo has always been sushi for the masses, fast, cheap and decent.  But my last visit was like dollar store sushi.  The restaurant was dirty and it really looks tired.  The service was ok at best.  The food was the worst.  Ginger chicken was fatty, chewy, over breaded and Luke warm.  The sushi was sloppy and tasted fishy. I would have rather gone next door to Wendy's."}
{"text":"I am absolutely in love with this place! I love the selection of food, the service is fast and friendly, and the ambience is hip and casual. We got seated right away and our order came in less than 10 minutes! Our food was delicious and the price of the food was definitely affordable. I would drive 30 mins everyday to come eat here!"}
{"text":"I love the Kinjo franchise. Their service is an authentic Japanese kind, welcoming and friendly. This location is, however, my favourite because the sushi bar is a whole different kind of experience. Instead of waiting for your food you can grab whatever is in front of you if you're so hungry and can't wait.   The food is one of the freshest tasting I have tried in Calgary so far. Being from BC, it's hard to find sushi and seafood that's up to par with its freshness in AB. Kinjo does an amazing job getting good quality stuff, keeping it fresh and making delicious dishes. Some of my favourite things to order are the seared salmon/tuna nigiri, the volcano roll, the scallop nigiri, the assorted tataki appetizer, and the green tea ice cream just to name a few.   I must emphasize the service here because it really is fantastic. I'm all about the people, and if it's one thing that makes me come back to a restaurant it's the good service and Kinjo definitely represents that."}
{"text":"all I can say is wtf.....  I was in Calgary for work during the crazy floods so all the good food spots in downtown were closed/inaccessible. I was forced to eat southwest calgary (some decent spots, smugglers in/thai food/broken plate) and I ended up making my way to Kinjo sushi. The place was pretty packed at 8pm so I decided to give it a shot(first mistake, revolving sushi bars always suck).  I ended up ordering a decent amount of food (tamago, salmon sashimi, toro sashimi, tuna sashimi, chicken teriyaki, yam tempura, raw steak sushi)   Everything I ordered was a disappointment. The Tamago had no flavor and not even a hint of sweetness. The chicken teriyaki was decent but pretty sure a piece was under cooked (didn't even bother risking it and eating the rest). All 3 orders of sashimi were obviously slacked out, wet, nasty tasting sashimi (ate 2 pieces out of the 9 and left the rest to be tossed). The raw steak sushi was surprisingly edible and the best dish was the tempura yam and even then it was slightly over-fried.  The total bill came out to couple dollars shy of $40, if I only got the raw steak and tempura yam I would probably review this 2-3 stars.  Maybe I am just spoiled from all the great REAL sushi spots in LA but this place was severely underwhelming. I have no idea how this place has 4 stars while being peoples \"go to sushi spot\". Either these people haven't had real sushi or they are the people who get the weird deep fried rolls with 10 different types of mayo on top.   Sorry people of Calgary but this place is definitely a huge disappointment"}
{"text":"Even when is not the best sushi in town I really liked it... The service was very friendly and fast! ... Also the sushi was not bad... I might go back if I am around..."}
{"text":"I felt like sushi and was in the area, so I stopped in at Kinjo after finding it on Yelp.  I was seated quickly and my waitress was very attentive to my needs the entire time.  I was quite impressed with the menu and ordering system.  Someone who didn't know the Japanese names of each piece (Toro, etc.) would LOVE this place!  There are pictures for everything and the ordering sheet is easy to understand.  At the time I ordered I thought I had enough food, so I opted not to get the mango roll (even though it looked good and was highly recommended on Yelp).  Afterwards I wish I had, as 15 pieces of sushi and some miso soup wasn't enough.  Next time (and there will be one)."}
{"text":"Frozen fish. For $6.50 a plate for 3 pieces of sashimi, I expected fresh fish. Go to a AYCE for this price and quality."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi, excellent pricing, attentive staff, downright awesome every single time!"}
{"text":"We got takeout from Kinjo and the first thing we noticed was how much of their menu had fried food in it. Now don't get me wrong... fried food is delicious! But does it need to be in half the rolls??? No... but it is. We still decided to order from Kinjo since it had decent reviews.  Have some water and tea ready!!! While the seafood is decent, we found most things very salty... would you like some rice and fish with your salt, fried batter, and mayo sauce? If so, order here! Any good quality ingredients that may have been here were overpowered by salt and creamy sauces... even on the seaweed salad. The food lacked the clean and subtle tastes I have come to respect in Japanese sushi.   If you like to douse your sushi in soy sauce, you may enjoy the sushi here. That said, I love salt and this was just too much for me.... but to give you some context, I am a Vancouver sushi snob who had the best sushi of her life last year in Hokkaido.... Won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Kinjo is the leader in both service and quality. I love my sushi and tend to be a bit of a sushi snob! I was very very impressed with the taste and textures of all they had to offer (and I had almost everything). The waitresses were so pleasant and very very thorough. I loved that my water was always topped off and always checked on~!  Being my first time, one of the guys who worked there made it very fun! They all sang to welcome me on my first time, which was awesome and hilarious as well as embarrassing!   They also sang to a woman who was celebrating her birthday! all very entertaining!  I would reccommend anyone to KINJO SUSHI. Being your first time or a veteran you will find all your favorites here! Not to mention at a crazy low price. (we at till we were filled to the brim and were surprised at the inexpensive menu!)"}
{"text":"This is a good place for quick service, always good fish and friendly servers. Always leaving this place happy and full. The sushi boats are nice to try different sushi items I wouldn't usually order. Nice to see the cooks area is clean and fun to watch"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for sushi. The fish is fresh and delicious. The service is very friendly and attentive. I started to go there when Peter Kinjo (later finding out he is the owner) was the pocky man and he is honestly so genuine and charming. He always went around the restaurant and took the time to chat with everyone to make sure everything was okay and that people were enjoying themselves. It never felt intrusive and he always looked like he loved his job.   One thing I really like about the sushi is the portion and the sizes. Don't get me wrong, I try not to discriminate against other types of sushi because I know it comes in all beautiful shapes and sizes, but I like the fact that Kinjo rolls are small enough that I can easily eat them without mentally preparing myself to chew for the next 5 minutes (we've all done it with one of those monster rolls before).   I'm also a big person when it comes to eating a little bit of everything and sometimes it's tricky with other sushi places as the rolls can be a lot bigger and especially if it's only 2 people, you can only order so many different rolls as you have a crazy bill or a lot of leftovers (which is also not a bad thing). With Kinjo, you can try many different plates as most of them come in 4 pieces. If you sit next to the sushi boat, beware. You will order from the menu and then just fill up like crazy from that damn boat. And then by the time your food actually comes out, you'll probably be full.   My only complaint is that the tempura is pretty small and not what you'd expect it to be and same with the teriyaki chicken/beef. They're still good, but I wouldn't say they're my favourite.   Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite sushi restaurants in Calgary! It's always busy, you have the option of ordering from the menu or grabbing from the floating sushi boats. I don't think I've ever been disappointed in the sushi - it's delicious! They sometimes bring a small sample plate for you to try. The energy of the place is great, with staff sometimes breaking out in a quick song or chant. They sing to people when it's their birthday and get a special treat. The ladies always get a box of Pocky at the end of the meal. I've been disappointed with the service once or twice, but as I said, it's a very busy place and I think they try to keep on top of it as much as they can!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were on MacLeod a few days ago and there were four other sushi places along the trail. We tried to go to the all-you-can-eat buffet one but we just happened to come during their gap closed hour. So we sat in the parking lot and looked up reviews for The One Sushi across the street (heard repeatedly that it was sticky) and decided to try out Kinjo down the road instead. I'm not a big sushi person though and have had it literally one other time in my life but I was willing to give it a shot because it seemed like a good place.  Ohhhh my god. So good. Okay, let me explain all the things that make this place so wonderful and how we're probably gonna come back at least 1000 times before we're seniors. Come in and we were welcomed and seated really quickly in a booth and given a plate of four rolls. Forget the other two, but that california roll and volcano roll were amazing. Totally great. Our waitress and the service were prompt and friendly. I liked the volcano rolls so much that I ordered a plate for myself. We ordered dynamite rolls, spicy tuna rolls, rainbow rolls, california rolls, deep fried shrimp. Oh, and eel. I also got fried rice for myself. The food arrived so quick and it was just delicious, we probably got our food 10-15 minutes after we ordered, it was that fast. The portion of fried rice I got was more than I thought it'd be, but totally worth it. Volcano rolls are a must-get.  A really cute touch is that if you sit in a booth beside the center kitchen, there's a conveyor belt with little boats on it that have plates of sushi on it that you can just grab and take as you please if a boat rolls by and you see something you like. We thought it was so cool. Plus you can see the cooks at work.  Everyone who works at the restaurant seems really close, and when the staff see someone they know come in (I'm guessing it was either a fellow employee or a regular customer) they shout the person's name in a \"Ayyyy my dude is here\" kind of way. It's awesome. It makes the whole atmosphere of the restaurant seem really fun. Can't really say anything about the speed of the restaurant during busy hours because the first time we came was a Monday afternoon just as people were getting out of work and we were already at the restaurant.  Oh, and you get free Pocky after your visit!!! Who doesn't love that? I think that's something the customers really love - it's a really awesome, thoughtful, unique touch. Anyways, we think this place is basically perfect and we tipped huge afterwards.   So summarized, we didn't really see any downsides to this place. + Totally delicious and I'll probably try different kinds of sushi next time now that I know I like it + Short wait time! + Friendly friendly serviceeee! + Fun, tight-knit atmosphere + Cheap/affordable! Our total bill between three people came to $69.00 (haha). When you consider how much food we ordered and how good it was, that was a great deal. + SUSHI. ON BOATS. + FREE POCKY + Not sticky  Believe me, this place is a ####ing gem and my crew will be back. 5/5 would empty my wallet again."}
{"text":"We've been here few times and we're from Vancouver! Lol every time were out in Calgary visiting family and friends we always stop at kinjos.  They have a great selection of fusion rolls and traditional ones too.  Great quality of food, very fresh and very creative with the fusion rolls.  One of my favourites is the dragon roll, both female and male.  My husband loves the Benihana roll, but it's too spicy for me.    I discovered a new roll today, the black stone roll, it has cooked squid, raw salmon, avocado and mini roe eggs.  Delicious!  And for females, they give you a box of pocky after dinner! Just to females though.  Today the waiter knew we came all the way from Vancouver and gave us the 'mega' box of pocky.   Great friendly service! We always come back for more!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food.  Had the salmon sashimi - very sweet and a fair size.  Had their Lobster Roll (lobster meat, tail and all!), Hot Unagi Roll (all warm and gushy!), Female Dragon Roll (pretty sight to see!), also had their Special Scallops Sushi (found their nigiri seaweed is crispy and adds a bit of a crunch to the wonderfully-put-together special scallops sushi!)  Peter @ Kinjo comes to the table and schmoozes with the party at the table - everyone's rolling in laughter and we get Glico Pocky as gifts.  Not only that, we also got a sushi sampler at the start and in the middle, Peter presented us with a tempura sampler consisting of 2 prawns, yam, brocolli and asparagus!  I've never been to a restaurant that gives out free food before.    Might have to come back again!"}
{"text":"It was all good until they dropped fish on the floor then cut it up and served it right in front of my eyes!!!!"}
{"text":"Kinjo Sushi - that sounds like a sheer fun to me!  Make no mistake, that's not a sushi gourmet place. No! Not at all. Owner of Kinjo hires young kids, full of energy and fun, and they make this place brilliantly cool and full of joy - but nothing to do with exquisite food.  Just try their calamari, you'll see what I mean. :-)  But otherwise, me and my wife have been to Kinjo many times, and were always leaving the place with a smile on our faces - overall experience was so good...  And it's cheap. Not in a bad sense - food is actually clean and fresh, but you'd be feeling really heavy if you'll fill yourself up to something like forty bucks a couple, if you're using their bar.  I would say, a great place to visit with a bunch of buddies not too bothered with proper Japanese protocol and sushi chef's masterpieces. Just get in there, chat your ass off and have fun - that's what Kinjo is about.  Totally recommended!"}
{"text":"Went to the Dalhousie location for lunch one day just to see the difference between it and their flagship MacLeod Trail location.    This one has a very different vibe, much more upscale, and no sushi boat.   While we were there it was super busy, we waited 20 min. for a table, because they had a sushi class going on.      The menu is the same, and the fish and other rolls tasted identical to their other location.  The only difference is the decor, and the vibe.   If you want a different experience but the same Kinjo taste take a drive up to the NW."}
{"text":"Kinjo is fantastic - there are many times I've been to other sushi places and have been disappointed with their salmon and tuna quality.  I have been to Kinjo 20+ times and have never once been disappointed in the quality of fish.    The rice is always perfect and I really like that they have a sweet and regular soya sauce to choose from.  My boyfriend and I go there quite frequently and the bill is always right around $50 every time.  We love the giant squid legs - they come with volcano sauce for dipping.   The sashimi is delightful as well.  Although sometimes when it is busy, it is quite chaotic - once seated the chaos seems to dissipate and it really isn't a big deal.  The staff is always friendly even despite this chaos as well.  It is sometimes difficult to pay at the end of the dinner because there are so many people in the make shift waiting lounge.  Overall Kinjo is the go-to for sushi for me."}
{"text":"Overpriced and underwhelming. As far as sushi restaurants in Calgary go this one is average. The sushi selection is standard and the quality of the fish is good but the prices are so high for what you actually get. We have been here a few times. It always seems like they forget about something on our order and it arrives when we have already finished the rest of our meal.   The interior looks nice, there a lot of seating and the layout of the tables is good but the plates that the sushi arrives on have a Sushi Boat feel. We also saw other people get Pocky when they paid their bill, but we did not get the Pocky. In the end we wished that we went to Sushi Boat."}
