{"text":"We were greeted by a nice young lady and we were seated. Spanish music is loud but enjoyable. Horchata was yummy! Salsa served with chips was very good. 

We ordered the special which was shrimp cocktail. It was delicious. Good size shrimp  tasted fresh and served with avocado."}
{"text":"We went Thursday for oysters they where on special i live like 5 minutes away and i got em to go by the time i got home and try to eat them they smell really bad so i tried calling and some really rude girl answer me i explain to her what happened with my food and she hang up on me i tried again from a different number and asked for the manager and again another rude lady answer me and she told me she cant do nothing about it because her manager wasn't there even tho they could of just gave me my money back because these is some serious stuff i mean people dye's for things like these. I had beings disappointed before from there but these tips the ice. Idk why if their gonna have specials they give you SPOILED OYSTERS. Not to mention the roaches we saw while we waited like how do these people pass their heath inspections? Dirty place rude people ."}
{"text":"It gets one star only because I have to give it something to allow me to review this dump. Everything happened in this order... You walk in and it's humid/muggy, turn on the AC. Flies flying around everywhere to the point that I had to get a menu to swat them. Salsa was good but chips were cold and stale. Roach about an inch long crawls along the side of the table and as I jumped out of the booth three employees run over to me to try convincing me the roach didn't drop into my purse that was wide open on the bench right under the moving roach. After I cleaned out my purse I was handed a 14.47 dollar bill. Did I really have to pay for our two sodas and empanadas?!?! Disgusted! While waiting to pay we noticed a few more bugs on the floor (crickets and upside down roaches)"}
{"text":"Good place with good food.  Service is better if you speak Spanish.  There is s bit of a language barrier.  It wasn't a problem for me though.  :)"}
{"text":"Went and had a tasteful lunch but the service was horrible started by brushing us off when we entered told us to sit anywhere then when ordering drinks walked away while we were talking twice then laughed at my husband for the way he said sprite which he said the correct way everyone at the table was confused at what was so funny my mother ordered 2 shrimp tacos was given 2 fish tacos then my husband had an extremely salty lemonade which almost made him gag I also ordered a lemonade that was never brought to the table but was still charged for it. The food was good but will never return to this place just because of the terrible service when my sister went to pay the bill and correct the receipt it took a total of two time before the actually listened and gave us the right total. Worst service I've ever had."}
{"text":"We went on karaoke night so we had no issue with the off tune singing, in fact it was about the best thing in the restaurant. We were a bit disappointed by some of the bad language of the karaoke MC though. 

The hosted was great and she also took the time to joke with our daughters as we left. 

The waitress was less than helpful and seemed a little annoyed to even be there. When she took our drink order she told us there were no fountain drinks even though they were on the menu which meant \"Mexican coke\" was my wife's only option. This also meant no refills which is a tad annoying. When I asked which beer they had she just stared at me so I ordered the club sandwich of beers...coors light.

My wife ordered the pulpo mojo de ajo which had decent flavor but was swimming in oil and was too salty.

I kept looking at the menu for a plate to order but all that was listed was tacos and burritos for carne asada. Finally I asked if there was a carne asada plate and the waitress said yes with no price given or  explanation why there was no listing on the menu. The meat was very tough and flavorless but came with grilled red onions which were a nice touch.

Salsa was decent and the chips were fine but nothing stood out. 

We will keep on the search for a \"go to\" restaurant in our area but this one is not even on the short list."}
{"text":"Nice interior, but we should have caught wise when we saw we were the only customers in the entire establishment during all of dinner hours. (The salsa and chips were REALLY good.) I ordered the shrimp burrito. It came out and this terrible travesty consisted of unseasoned buterflied, breaded deef-fried shrimp, with a sprinkling of white cheese, wrapped in a tortilla. That's it. No salsa, beans, rice, veggies, avocado/guac, nothing else in it. Just dry, overbreaded greasy shrimp nuggets. It seemed to have been made by someone who had only the barest and most technical understanding of what a burrito is supposed to be. It was tasteless and bland and my 7 years living in Mexico wanted to rage-fling the dang thing across the restaurant for offending every abuelita who ever knew her way around a kitchen. My husband ordered the red snapper, and while it was palatable and the portion large, he reported it as completely unremarkable. It was advertised as having a garlic sauce, and what came out was a plain fried fish with rough-chopped chunks of roasted garlic on top. The side of fries we ordered were undersalted, soft and not crispy at all; they could have done with a second dip in the fryer. Everything aside from that heinous burrito was adequate, but just that and no more, and nowhere near the price we paid. ($50 for 2 adult entrees a side of fries and 2 kids meals, no drinks) A terrible disappointment, considering it's right in the heart  of South Phoenix where amazing Mexican food is on every corner. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Fresh seafood... If you don't mind the Mexican music and Fridays Spanish karaoke night. You are going to like this place. The seafood taste fresh"}
{"text":"Careful where you eat, a lot of their stuff is expired but frozen so it appears odorless"}
