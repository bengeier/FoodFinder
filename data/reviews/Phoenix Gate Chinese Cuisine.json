{"text":"Plenty of parking in front of the stripmall and the restaurant was not busy on a Tuesday night. Came here with 4 of us tonight and got 4 dishes to share. The seafood fried rice was super fluffy and not greasy at all and was tasty. The snow pea shoots with oysters mushrooms, pineapple  and sour pork was yummy and my favourite bass the cream sauce lobster on crispy noodles. Service was good and food was delicious would come back again"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located inside the Madison, an apartment building with shops on the main floor.  It replaces Tai Pan at its old location inside the mall.  I have been here several times for dim sum and dinner.  There is a good selection of dim sum, including the popular shrimp dumplings.  This review is on their special set dinner combo with Peking duck.  The Peking duck combo is said to be for 4 people.  I went there with a bigger group so we ordered a few extra dishes, including the $8.88 daily special, which varies daily.  The combo features 3 style of Peking duck: duck meat which you can wrap with cucumber and spring onion in a crepe (see picture), soup, and a stir-fried udon with duck meat.  The combo also has other dishes including a stir-fried veggies with beef (see picture), a crispy fish (sole - see picture), and a lobster in ginger and green onion sauce (see picture - noodles extra $4).  Overall, all the dishes have good portion sizes and flavour.  Would definitely recommend to anyone who likes Peking duck or wants to try out a variety of dishes without much thinking."}
{"text":"Tried out Phoenix Gate for the first time today.  The menu is quite extensive and we finally ordered the following: Fish Maw with Crab Meat Soup - nicely done. Chef's Special Chicken served cold with a oily & salty ginger and onion sauce - delicious and huge chunks of chicken. Beef and Gai Lan in a garlic sauce - very tender gai lan and the beef was very tender as well Steamed Fish with a ginger and scallion sauce - it was good but the fish they had, had a lot of bones.  Was difficult to eat.  It was the \"Wan Yi\". Prawns with Vermicelli Pot - tasty..nice big prawns.  Had to peel the prawns though. Steamed rice Dessert was the Red Bean Soup, on the house - nice touch to the end of the meal.  Service was quite good.  The lady who served us was a pleasant, older lady and she tried to speak some English and mostly Cantonese.  We managed to communicate nonetheless.  She told us to come back for their dim sum and their Peking Duck 3 course special for $39.99.  Well, guess we gotta go back!"}
