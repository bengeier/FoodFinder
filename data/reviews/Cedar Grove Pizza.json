{"text":"I stopped in for a quick slice one afternoon and it was decent. A little old (it was 2 pm), but definitely not the worst slice in town.

They also offer Mediterranean cuisine which I plan to try next time. I just wish they kept the pizza fresh and gave you a bigger slice. But, like I said, it's not bad. And it's pretty cheap too; something like $2.50 I think."}
{"text":"Great pep and donair pizza - just make sure they've been made recently - quality decreases pretty fast after its out of the oven. Great crust."}
{"text":"Worst donair in the city. The lettuce was actually brown. Dry and poorly wrapped. Just garbage. Feel shame !"}
{"text":"Cedar (Sedar) Grove Pizza? Well, If you're hungry and in the area, sure! It's a pizza by the slice joint that will have 2 or 3 kinds of pizza on hand for pizza by the slice, as well as well as some Mediterranean food and takeout pizzas .  The donair pizza seems like their thing - donair meat, topped with with fresh tomatoes and lettuce. By fresh I mostly mean not cooked, not over spectacular and crisp, but raw. They serve a bunch Mediterranean street food like donairs as well.  There really doesn't seem to be much italian influence in this kind of pizzeria. Cedar Grove seems like one of Calgary's many street food style shops that seem to have a background in Mediterranean, but have decided to make pizza as well. Is it good though? Sure it is. The slices were under $3 a piece which makes them a pretty good bang for the buck. You'll probably want 2 slices for a lunch quantity of pizza. 

The place is nothing out of the ordinary in the way it looks. it's moderately clean with moderately friendly people working there serving moderately good food. Go in. Order pizza. Get out. aaaaaand that's about it. If you're in the area and hungry for pizza. Sure, why not?"}
{"text":"Possibly the worst slop I've ever tasted in my life. Ended up throwing most of it in the garbage. I ordered salt and pepper chicken wings and baked spaghetti. What I got was dried out flavourless pigeon wings and microwaved canned spaghetti with cheese melted on top."}
{"text":"I heard from a friend of mine that this place had really good donairs so I decide to give them a try. I myself ordered a pizza and person I was with order a Donair. Both were quite good the Donair was actually really yummy it was a large and it was large definitely not small. I only got a small 10 inch pizza because I've never tried the place before. It was so good the crust was nice and crunchy it is definitely a place I would order a pizza from again only get a larger size. It's a little place not big and fancy guy that was working behind the counter was nice and friendly definitely a place if you're looking to try something new that you haven't tried before a different place give this place a try"}
