{"text":"Great authentic Chinese food. One of my favorite places to eat good Chinese food. Definitely recommend coming here"}
{"text":"Im so glad i did not check out Yelp before coming in, otherwise  I would have never tasted Eggplant this good!! Order Garlic Eggplant, tasty, spicy and slightly crispy on the outside, succulent on the inside.  Not like your average Chinese Garlic Eggplant; it's the better version of it.

Service is awesome and prompt

Place is SUPERCLEAN!"}
{"text":"Why bother.  Food is missing Chinese flavor.  Like teriyaki chicken, chicken was dry sauce taste like soy sauce.  Eat here if you have no taste for Asian food."}
{"text":"This place has considerably improved. It is so much cleaner than before. Attitudes of the staff have improved dramatically. Before the owner seemed to care less about guests and now he is positive and speaking to every guest. I think the menu is much better as well. Now there are photos one the menu and great listings. He took the time to upgrade all the tables and seats. Before there would be patch jobs on the booths and now they are new. New checkout counter and even installed a new television. They also have more tables to serve guests. Overall an amazing difference!"}
{"text":"Sad... Miss the smile of Friendly waiters...Full of enthusiasm. Food is not great without those friendly Smile. Good thing I will not miss these place- cause not coming back. Bring back the Chef n the friendly waiters!!!"}
{"text":"Was greeted right away, got water and hot tea. Proceeded to wait 25 minutes, no further interaction from any staff. Looking around, making eye contact with several staff, including from the kitchen, still no interaction. We left. This is no Wong's Place!!!"}
{"text":"I order from Mandarin House at least once a week. Delivery is always quick and the fee is low as well. Formerly known as Wong's Place, this recently renovated restaurant serves classic and modern Chinese eats very well and at a great price. Portion sizes are generous, I usually get a soup, crab rangoons, and an entree such as mongolian beef or general tso's chicken and there's always leftovers.

Whether it's take out or dine in, this is easily one of the best local Chinese spots around Tempe."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the new ownership has not maintained the flavor standards of Wong's Place. The decor has been updated and the food is fresh, but the sauces have little flavor. This is a run of the mill Americanized Chinese restaurant now."}
{"text":"The food is great and the server is nice and deliver fast"}
{"text":"Today was our 2nd time ordering through grub hub. The prices are fair for the portion sizes, and the food got here pretty quick. The food was pretty good, especially the egg rolls. My chicken was a little soggy (possibly the result of ordering delivery instead of dining in), but still had pretty good taste. We will probably order from here again in the future"}
{"text":"Local eatery where I've been coming for a long time (back when it was Wongs)
Just recently noticed they have an online website with menu & ordering options.  I did however notice that when you place an order online , you have to register as a user.  I did not feel comfortable so I decided to place my order and see what my total will be.  I then proceeded to call my order in and I noticed the price online was higher than the price they gave me over the phone.  So for the next time I will simply call in my order rather than fill out the form online regardless if I'm picking up the order myself"}
{"text":"OK with the caveat I have only ordered take out since the reno, but THE NOODLES ARE BACK & GREAT AS EVER! So I'm confused by so many reviews, some I just had to post to contradict! Henry IS there! Mr. Wong was there! The noodles were still the best I've had since San Francisco. One reviewer cited the old reliable servers vs. the new, which ironically I had chided Wong's for before they closed (they had some old dependable servers who were awesome, they also hired some new ones who - were NOT!) so service varies. The decor is updated as was needed. I AM SO HAPPY THE NOODLES I GOT WERE GOOD AS EVER! I WILL be going back when I have more time to try their other fare, see what's there. Their online website menu seems pretty extensive, so not sure what some said was missing. I'll have to try some of our old favorite dishes, see if they're still the same. 

I wonder where  all the naysayers posting here negative comments now, claiming they were such fans of old Wong's WERE when Wong's was open, don't see their glowing praises of Wong's then, but see some negative comments, even then... so now we claim to gain respect as a responsible reviewer claiming we \"were\" fans for decades, citing such a contrast now, but no evidence of glowing reviews supporting them then? Something smells fishy, & it's not Wong's fish. & HENRY is IN the building! & the NOODLES ROCK!"}
{"text":"If I wasn't comparing it to Wong's Place, maybe it would have been better but the rice tasted like minute rice, and all my old favorites are gone like Wong Jo chicken, Garlic Shrimp with broccoli and Hong Kong wonton soup.  There's no compelling reason to go back here.  Panda Express would have been better."}
{"text":"Delivery order was spot on.  Quicker than promised and great food!  Will order again!"}
{"text":"I had the general tso first and it had a funny taste. I decided to give it one more chance and had the sesame chicken and it was pretty good. What has me coming back is the steamed dumplings and crab Rangoon's! They are both really good. I'm going with broccoli beef next time and I'm hoping for the best. The best part is the cheap fast delivery service by far! Very decent Chinese food and I'm really picky."}
{"text":"This is now my go-to restaurant. The food is excellent. The staff are warm and friendly. They know my whole family by name and drink order. The food is tasty. My favorite is the Pepper beef off the chef Specialty menu. I have an autistic son who is a picky eater. He eats everything they have here. He loves the scallion pockets. I order delivery and it is always on time (today it was early) and at just the right temperature. The restaurant is clean and well kept. The lunch specials are top notch. You get nice-sized portions for a low price. Very high quality food for a low price."}
{"text":"Finally a good chinese restaurant that's closer to me. They actually know how to make General Tso's Tofu the right way and make it in the right portion for an okay price. I get it with brown rice and it comes out to a little under $10. I love the taste of the food here. It's hard find good chinese in Arizona but this is a great spot. My girl gets the sizzling fried rice soup which is also really hard to find in AZ. This place does it all and does it right. I will keep coming here. I also like the workers. They all have good customer service skills and are rrally professional. I like that on my second visit they let us order a pick up order after they were already closed. We ended up getting our chinese fix and it was so neccessary!"}
{"text":"I live in old town scottsdale and this is my go to spot for Chinese delivery! About 40 minutes and the food is always well packed and Hot!!!! And to top of top notch delivery the prices can't be beat! Just had the chicken curry with pork fried rice!"}
{"text":"Wong's place was a mile better than this place. I ordered the Twice Sauteed Pork which barely had any pork and was not as flavorful as expected. Also got the 
Sauteed String Beans in Garlic Sauce and that dish was too sweet for my liking. I guess all hopes of going back to the old Wong's menu are dashed."}
{"text":"Always fast, inexpensive, tasty, and hot when delivered. Only Chinese delivery I order in the area, its as simple as that. Bonus points as well for seemingly finding my apartment with ease, other delivery places always call and are confused about where i'm located."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where others were eating, but I am enjoying the food at Mandarin House FAR better than Wong's. Wong's was very salty and oily. This food was delicious, with flavor but not overly salty. We had the House Special Wonton Soup- packed with wontons, shrimp (tons of them), pork and chicken. It was so good! We also ordered the chicken Chow Mein, which my boyfriend agreed was much better now, and the Moo Sho Chicken. It was all so good and our delivery came fast (Wong's never delivered so this is great!). We'll be ordering from here much more now. It's no longer the \"because it's close\" option, but also because it's good."}
{"text":"This place had decent reviews, but the food wasn't good.  I used Grub Hub for delivery or I would have refused to pay.  I got a Pu Pu platter with hard teriyaki chicken, shrimp with the nasty vein still intact with breading covering it.  The fried wonton was the worst I ever had.   I did eat the crap puffs, but they weren't that great.  The spring rolls were soggy.

The other order was a chicken chow mein combo.  I didn't try the egg roll, but my boyfriend eats anything.  I did try the chow mein and egg fried rice.  Nothing to write home about.

Lastly, the fortune cookies don't have fortunes, but they do have lotto numbers.  Weird!"}
{"text":"Same owners as the restaurant that was here before Wongs.  Food wasn't bad but it wasn't good. Technically everything was made well but flavor was not what I was expecting. When we walked in we asked \"same\"owner if they still had chow fun he replied yes we ordered it and it was a completely different dish.Mentioned this to owner and his response was \"it's a different restaurant\". At the end of the meal we tried telling him the food was disappointing he shrugged his shoulders and walked away. Disappointed won't be returning."}
{"text":"I ordered my food to be delivered . They didn't come to the correct area to deliver. He called me, I told him where I was. He was rude. Then hands me my food out the window and drove off. I ordered 1 egg roll, 8 dumplings, lunch orange chicken. The dumplings were dried, tasted old, looked terrible. The egg roll was cold. The orange chicken was old, it's like they served me yesterdays or last week's food. It was $20 with tip which I feel I was robbed. I will never eat here again. Bad service, bad food bad review.

So I was contacted and they said they would refund my money and give me credit. They didn't refund my money but they did give me $10.00 credit. I asked them again about the refund, they said they would. Still nothing."}
{"text":"My roommates and I ordered delivery from them close to their closing time. They delivered without an issue, fast, and with fresh food. The deliver driver was very nice! Overall the food was fresh and we had no complaints!!"}
{"text":"So, we ordered through Amazon. Service I can comment on. However, I can on the food. Sesame chicken is pretty basic, fried rice was really great, dumplings we're good, beef with broccoli had great flavor and portions..... Yet, when we talk about the pan fried noodles with pork, I am dissatisfied. It was almost all pork and veggies with a thin layer of very small noodles at the bottom. Normally, I'd be happy with it, but since I was ordering noodles for my four year old who specifically asked for noodles, it is a let down. These noodles look nothing like any of the pictures. I took a couple of pictures that I will upload shortly. Steer clear of the pan fried noodles if you are actually looking forward to getting.... noodles."}
{"text":"This is nice little neighborhood spot to eat. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food. I tried the orange chicken, and today I tried the cashew nut chicken.  Both were very good. I will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"My food arrived just now. Never again. 

First of all, I ordered spring rolls and they gave me egg rolls. I did not want anything deep fried, so I got very annoyed.

I ordered shrimp chow mein and shredded pork with garlic sauce. 

Chow mein is so blend that I am doubting any presence of sauce on here. By the color, some seasoning is done, but I am not tasting anything. I'm trying to describe it, but it literally taste like nothing. It smells slightly nutty, but not even taste of any noodle. Amazed by how they destroyed all the taste here. Even the shrimp just taste like boiled shrimp. STRAIGHT OUT from boiling. Very annoyed. 

The garlic sauce is okay-ish, but the 1/3 of the pork are in a bad shape. It feels so dry and crumbly that I am not sure if I am chewing pork. Definitely not worth the price.

When I was looking for delivery, I saw the place on yelp and believed the last review where it said 'the chef and owner are still there and it's good.' I never tried Wong's place, but because it was told to be good, I thought I would try it. Also, I am NOT a picky eater at all. However, it taste far worse than anywhere I paid to eat. I will not be ordering again."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about this place. The people are very kind , the food was great, there are tons of things on the menu and have a decent selection of vegetarian/vegan food."}
{"text":"Had the Kung Pao Chicken lunch ($5.75). It was excellent in taste, just the right amount of spice, large portion, fabulous spring roll and the obligatory fortune cookie go with the meal.
Super clean, really nice staff, choice of booths or tables, and parking close to the door.

I have tried many Asian restaurants in the East Valley, and this is one of my favorites. Also, the price is a great value for what you get. I have not yet used their delivery service, but look forward to doing so in the future."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. 2 stars because the staff was decent but other than that, it's just a waste of money for me. I found them through grubhub. Ordered 3 things: the Yang Chow fried rice, 3 vegetable thingy (broccoli, peas and string beans) and the Singapore Noodles. None of them had stellar flavor. The most flavorful out of the dishes was the 3 veggie dish thing, it was drowned in Oyster Sauce. The delivery driver was 25 minutes late, but he apoligized and he said there was an accident. I understand, things happen and he seemed genuinely apologetic anyways. But yeah, food wise though.... Nope."}
{"text":"Please bring back Wong's Place  the food portions are now smaller and not as good as Wong's menu. Please bring back the staff and old menu!"}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food I've had in years. Devoid of flavor and spice. Small portions, everything is suddenly sweet. Service would have been ok had they not got my order completely wrong. RIP wongs. Don't bother."}
{"text":"Family had a craving for Wongs Place.  Saw they were replaced by this new restaurant.  Why not??  We will give it a try.  So we placed to-go & ordered a quart of Hot & Sour soup, chicken chow mein, coconut shrimp, sweet & sour chicken, & beef with snow pea & mushroom.  $44 & some change.  We expected the to-go white paper cartons to be full.  Instead we got smaller portions in plastic containers.  The coconut shrimp and beef with snow peas & mushrooms was not very warm but good.  That earned an extra star in rating.  The hot & sour soup was not even room temperature & we had to nook it before we took a spoon of the bland oily sludge.  The sweet & sour chicken batter had an old oily smell & taste to it.  Chicken chow mein consisted of soggy oily thick lo mein noodles.  Maybe they were trying to be nice & put pork & shrimp in it but I didn't order that.  There were no veggies in the chow mein.  We are supporters of small businesses & we can say we gave it a try but will continue to seek out a Chinese take out place in our bubble.  Boy do we miss Wongs & Lee Chi Inn!"}
{"text":"Food is good, the price is good, they have fast delivery and super nice employees and customer service. Especially like the sweet/sour chicken and egg rolls."}
{"text":"Great food, fast delivery. Polite delivery guy. I'll use them again. Great Mu Shoo. The food was still hot when it arrived."}
{"text":"Order was late. Food was cold. Delivery guy was weird, said \"thanks for choosing Mandarin house\" saw my dog walking up and ran away before I could even give him a tip. Glad I didn't. Will never order again!!!!"}
{"text":"This is so not Wongs!!  I've been waiting for their food only to be highly disappointed by the people who took over. None of the dishes we ordered tasted like the terrific dishes provided by Wongs. My Mongolian beef looked like beef fajitas and tasted sweet. The chicken wings were too salty.  I'm really really going to miss Wongs!  And there were all new people there...no Henry!!"}
{"text":"Remember when this place was Wong's? It has been remodeled on the inside and the wait staff, who had been serving there for almost two decades, has all been replaced. Along with the face lift and change in staff the food has also changed. After being a patron of Wong's for almost my entire life I totally understand sometimes a business goes through change but this new menu and cooking doesn't live up to its predecessor."}
{"text":"Love the new business model.  Ordering online is super easy and the delivery charge is just a  dollar,  Also very fast.  The place has been remodeled and is more generic than it was before. Still a good place to go do just dont expect the old white linen cloth place. Much more casual now, kind of like a Pei Wei but with better food and more choices.."}
{"text":"Orange chicken and the fried chicken wings is my favourite!! Definitely a good place to eat and it is so clean!"}
{"text":"Second time we've ordered from here and they once again delivered perfection - sooner than expected too! Highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout, and like many of the other reviews I was hoping to give this place a chance after the renovation. The food is completely different. Very bland, no taste, smaller portions. I was very disappointed with their Mongolian Beef, like another review said it reminded them of beef fajitas and I agree. Consisted mostly of green peppers, onions and mushrooms, I had to dig for some meat. The beef fried rice used to be my favorite go to, sadly it also had no taste and barely any meat. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"We moved to the neighborhood a few month ago, right before this opened. We started ordering from here after we got a menu on our front door. DELICIOUS! The staff is very friendly, the restaurant is very clean, and every now and then they will even throw in a free soda or something with our meal. The price is also not bad. The only complaint is that some of the sauces are a little bland. But there is still plenty on the menu that has great taste. We have gone at least a dozen times now. :-)"}
{"text":"Formerly Wongs. Great food. Tasty and bold Flavors. The veggies seem fresh and that's awesome! Henry is still here. I'm happy they remodeled! Would love to see Buffett incorporated as the other place close by isn't that great."}
{"text":"Best Chinese take out I've had in a long time. Got here quicker than they said it would, was hot and fresh. 10/10 will order here again and again and again. Great food"}
{"text":"Firstly, they have very fast and problem free delivery. I order off of grubhub and got my order within the hour. Food was warm and very cheap, if you are looking for authentic Chinese food, this may not be the place. I ordered their chicken lo mein and orange chicken for lunch, but coming from a place with a lot of authentic and home cooked Chinese food, it was a struggle to finish my meal."}
{"text":"Wong's Place had always been my favorite Chinese Food in the Phoenix Area. The decor was woefully outdated, but the service was ALWAYS friendly and fast. They had a waiter there that I remember from the 90s. Who does that anymore? 

We were sad to see that Wong's was \"closed for renovations\". We were sadder to see a new name on the front of the shabby strip mall it was in, but were still hopeful that we'd get the same good food and service we were used to.

We finally tried it tonight. Mr. Wong (?) was still there, still playing with his false teeth but greeted us warmly and showed us a table right away. the renovation - which was LOOOONG overdue was very nicely done. Everything looked fresh and new - not dingy and gross like before. 

No tea - when it was Wong's, we were alway given nice tea to start the meal off.

Potstickers - horrible. Wong's potstickers always took a very long time, but they were hand made fresh to order and they were THE BEST potstickers in the entire Phoenix area without question. Even worse, there are no more potsticker sauces. All we got was a little bowl of I'm guessing soy sauce. 

House Special Soup - gone. No more. This soup - I was convinced after eating it for 20 or more years - that it had magical healing powers. I kid you not - if you felt like caca, eat that soup and you felt much better. The way to cure the common cold - I swear to you! But alas, it is no longer. I will need therapy because of this - I am so not looking forward to cold season this year :-(

Pork Fried Rice - so not the same. Not even close. This was relatively bland and even the portion was much smaller. Usually we take huge amounts of food home - not this time. Nothing went home. 

Szechuan Beef - The meet was very, very tender - almost like it was from a tenderloin. Not chewy at all. This was the lone high point. The sauce lacked creativity and tasted like it came out of a bottle or jar. The veggies were crisp and done nicely.

Happy Family - interesting and pleasant combination of beef, chicken, shrimp, krab and tons of veggies but like the Szechuan beef, the sauce lacked creativity and tasted like it came out of a bottle.

My bay area transplant husband forcefully approved of Wong's Place and said it was no different than eating in SF. I was pleased to see that other people felt that way too. 

Mandarin House tastes like what white people think Chinese Food should be. There is ZERO authenticity to this food whatsoever. 

The service was friendly - especially Mr. Wong (?) and his creepy teeth. I don't know where the waiter went - hopefully he found somewhere to go. He was a fixture there. 

We won't be back - unless they change the menu back."}
{"text":"So this place used to be called Wongs place. They changed their name, however it is still the same owner. 

I used to loveeeeee Wongs place! So we wanted to try it out again hoping that they still had the same menu. They no longer have the garlic fried rice. Nooooooo!!! Lol. I always ordered the crystal shrimp when I went to Wongs place. It tastes completely different now. Like there's not enough sauce on the shrimp. We also ordered the crab puffs which tasted different as well. Instead of the garlic fried rice we ordered the egg fried rice. However, it tasted really bland. 

I'm assuming that they have a new cook now because everything tasted different. Wongs used to be my favorite Chinese restaurant. However, everything tastes completely different now. I'm not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. The best customer service and prices for the food. I always get the shrimp egg and fried rice super delicious!"}
{"text":"Delivery is always super fast and food piping hot! Love this place! Ordered here many times and each time the food is just as good as before. The Chinese cuisine here is your typical American Chinese menu. Food quality is consistent and won't leave you disappointed. Serving sizes are large and filling. Definitely recommend if you're looking for good priced quality Chinese take out :)"}
{"text":"We have ordered delivery twice and dined in once. The food is always delicious and fresh. The dinner combos are a great deal and we usually have leftovers which reheat even better!"}
