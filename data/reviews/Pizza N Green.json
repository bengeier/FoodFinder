{"text":"A verity of pizza were delivered by a rep to my work. I had never heard of this place.  Pizza looked fantastic loaded with toppings and spread evenly along the pizza.  Pizza was not overly grease it actually tasted a lot healthier then other leading chains.  I loved the Chicken Pesto one. I was surprised at the prices for the taste I expected m9ore expensive but a large was $12.99.  I will put this at top of my list of places to eat at again."}
{"text":"There are very few things in life that piss me off like standing there, making my whole order for my office, then when I present my American Express card the person taking my order says they don't accept that. I get that some places don't take Amex, but if you don't then take the sign off your door! I check for that sign whenever I go out so I know it's accepted. The food looked good but the whole thing really irritated me."}
{"text":"I work near this restaurant and have never tried it until I saw it on groupon. It's exciting to find a decent restaurant near work. My husband and I tried it for dinner and got the supreme pizza. It is actually really good. Thin crust and a good amount of meat. I like that it has pepperoncini's on it. Will come back for sure, not all the time but maybe once a month. It seems like a good place to pick up some lunch. I will update as I try different stuff."}
{"text":"CLOSED - stopped by on 7/5/14 to try them but their was an official notice on the door that the restaurant was closed by the landlord and the property within was seized.  Phone number is disconnected."}
