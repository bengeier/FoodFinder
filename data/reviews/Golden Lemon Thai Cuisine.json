{"text":"It'll do. It's not great, but neither was Xin Yi Garden and I went back there just because, convenient. It's mediocre food and there's nothing on the menu that I've really enjoyed, but it's good for junky takeout food on a lazy/busy day. It's definitely not the same people running it as before. I'm sad that it's not better because it was really promising when it opened. It was busy the first time I went in and I wish more places were doing well in the neighbourhood. For now, the menu is too big, the food only takes 10 minutes to come out of the kitchen which is always a sign that it's premade, and it's always surprisingly expensive. Last time I got pad thai and an order of egg rolls and it was $20. That's pretty expensive for run-of-the-mill takeout.  There's better food in the hood, but again, it'll do in a pinch. I'm writing this review kindly because we don't have a grocery store around here so basically these restaurants keep me alive in between shopping treks."}
{"text":"I was also disappointed to see the first review be so poor. I was very eager when I saw they started renovation of this place. The previous Chinese restaurant seemed somewhat neglected and not particularly welcoming.  I'm fairly certain these are new owners (I asked the new owners myself) and they renovated the place nicely. It's warm and clean and very welcoming to be in.  This is not particularly cheap in terms of Thai food but not expensive either. The portions however are very generous and we usually have more than enough for leftovers. I loved the Tom Yum Soup which is great way to warm up on a cold day. We've tried a bunch of dishes and were pleasantly surprised by all of them.  I wouldn't classify this place as a destination dining experience but I am super glad that they are in the neighbourhood. We've been a handful of times and even catered from them and each time has been great. They are a welcome addition to the Jane Annette Culinary Corridor which is a term that I just made up :)   I hope this place is successful and would encourage people to support their local businesses."}
{"text":"If you're looking for average, cookie-cutter style Chinese food, look no further. The food here isn't terrible, it's just not great. There are no dishes or items that stand out and make you look back on your meal and reminisce or crave it in the future. The value for the combos are fair, but the single dishes are slightly over priced. As an example, we ordered the eggplant and chicken and what we got what a bunch of random veggies, 3 pieces of eggplant and roughly 4 pieces of chicken. If you find yourself in this strip of Jane, there are definitely better choices to be had."}
{"text":"I live nearby and finally tried this for the first time since it switched over from the previous Chinese restaurant. The food was average - not great and I feel it is a little overpriced for the quality of food.  I can't help but compare to the Chinese restaurant that used to be at this location which had a very misleading appearance. The restaurant was somewhat shabby and the decor was outdated but the food was fantastic, mainly due to it's freshness, and the price was very reasonable.  I have not eaten at Golden Lemon, just ordered takeout for a large group which I picked up so I cannot comment on the ambiance at the restaurant, but the staff I interacted with wass friendly.  would probably order again, simply because it is convenient."}
{"text":"On Monday, March 28th, 2016, I had nothing in my fridge and I just come back from work. I had arrived back home at 11:30pm from a very long trip on Easter Sunday, and so I didn't have time to get any groceries during the weekend. I decided to give the Golden Lemon a try, to hold me over until Tuesday. I'm always willing to try new restaurants - maybe I will find a new favourite?  I will admit, I am a good cook. I can make Pad Thai and other dishes amazingly well - and because of that, my standards for restaurants are fairly high. I often end up cooking dishes that are better than slightly-above average to semi high-end restaurants.  I will say the food here is miles below the quality that I could prepare myself - and it's always disappointing to find that out. It also does not compare to other Thai restaurants. For example, Thai Room, My Friendly Thai or Taste of Thailand all serve better Pad Thai and curries - especially for the price.  The big complaint that I have is that the Golden Lemon charges $13.99 for its Pad Thai or Golden Curry when the quality (and even portions) belong in the $8-9 range.   The Pad Thai was methodically boring. They need to use more tamarind and fish sauce. The noodles were undercooked, and they didn't even use Banh Pho rice noodles - they tasted more like a cheap Chinese variant. The noodles weren't even translucent in colour, which is how it's supposed to be cooked, and I doubt they were soaked for 30-45 minutes in water beforehand. The dish also lacked any reasonable amount of Tofu (I found 1 piece in my entire order), the eggs were not properly mixed in with the noodles, there were only 2 pieces of chives used as a garnish, and I can't even remember if there were any roasted peanuts. There were no crushed chilis, banana blossoms, turnip or any other garnishes used that are key to adding distinct flavours to the dish. The lime wedge was incredibly small as well - you should get at least 1/4 of an entire lime, but this wedge was so thin you could barely get any flavour out of it.  In the curry, the vegetables were barely cooked. There was actually cabbage in the dish (raw cabbage doesn't fit the flavour profile for Thai curries, not to mention their cabbage was horrendously undercooked and unseasoned despite that). I presume the cabbage was there to reduce the total cost of the ingredients. The sauce was thin and lacked texture. Honestly, I think they just cracked open a can of coconut milk and added some canned paste and called it a day. Thai curry pastes should be made with fresh ingredients - shallots, ginger, lemon grass, etc. - and they should be cooked to build texture and flavour before they are mixed in with the coconut milk. Instead, their curry was just milky and flavourless, and the vegetables were barely cooked in this mess, resulting in a dish that a university student could make by just purchasing the paste and coconut milk at a Thai grocery store.  What's really weird is that the side-sauces they give you don't even fit the dishes you ordered. Soy Sauce and some Hot Sauce variant? Just how am I supposed to use those with Pad Thai or Curry? Did you even think this stuff out? I ordered PAD THAI - please provide some freshly roasted peanuts in sesame seed oil and give some crushed dried red chilli peppers. Did you not even Google what is served with this dish?  All of the food I got tasted merely okay - none of it was \"bad\" and uneatable - but I seriously say that if you like Thai food, that you could do much better. If I am going to pay $13.99 for Pad Thai or a Thai Curry, then it better damn well be as good as what I could prepare at home. I feel like I massively overpaid and it was obvious that the food wasn't cooked with love, care or passion and the aim wasn't to really satisfy customers. The Golden Lemon simply makes fast Thai food that is undercooked and carelessly prepared with little thought or effort, and then rushes it out the door to customers that grossly overpaid for it.   Food lovers... please take my advice: Simply Avoid.  Regards, Katie"}
{"text":"Ordered an \"island meeting\" - included broccoli, coconut shrimp and fried calamari. My boyfriend ordered chicken pad woon sen. Both were extremely unsatisfying.  My order had flattened shrimp and the calamari tasted as if it had been fried days earlier, frozen and reheated just for me. Luckily they were successful at boiling broccoli. The chicken dish was the same - just not fresh or good, and when he tried it again today for lunch (not even 12 hours later) it tasted rancid. Horrible experience. We also tipped through orderit.ca, in addition to our food cost, and yet the delivery boy seemed to expect more from us. Really uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Ordered the Pineapple Chicken and Hot&Sour soup.  The dish I received was friend chicken strips with a dipping sauce on the side with no pineapple in sight.  Chicken was extremely dry and flavourless.  The Hot&Sour soup tasted like pure sugar!  Not spicy at all!  My friends has the Szechwan Beef and Genera Tao's Chicken which they did enjoy however the lemon vegetable soup was also very sugary.  Wouldn't order from here again."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed to see the first review of Golden Lemon is not positive; I had an entirely different experience!  I also live close-by and so was very happy to see the Chinese place that used to be here be taken over by new management.  I waited for weeks while they did extensive renovations to what was a very tired restaurant and the new decor is much nicer. I'd been to that Chinese place (and reviewed it). I would be very surprised if this was the same chef/team.  The food itself was also quite good. It is not a cheap thai place but I found the quality and presentation to be quite impressive. I've had a mango chicken lunch combo (the soup that came with it was especially delicious) and I've also had the chicken pad thai take-out. Both items were delicious, quickly prepared, and the staff were super friendly.  The only reason it is not 5 stars is because I did not find the food phenomenal or it to be incredible value or anything. But it is a great little restaurant that I will surely be a regular at."}
{"text":"This restaurant recently went through a self declared grand reopening and changed from Xin Yi Garden Chinese food to what it is now.   First, let me just say I'm very uncomfortable giving a bad review about an independently run business in my area, but I must give you a dire warning. The food here is barely edible. Also, the smell of cigarette smoke was unavoidable for some reason. I would guess they're smoking in the back, or basement.   We ordered three entrees and spent good money on them as this place is not super cheap compared to other Thai restaurants in the area.   This is clearly still the same chef that ran the Chinese restaurant previously as the food was much closer to Chinese despite rebranding it as \"Thai.\" All the food had watered down broths, little to no flavor and was by far the worst attempt at Thai I have ever seen or tasted. Even the pad Thai was a sticky flavorless joke.   Clearly, these people have no interest in serving any sort of quality food. Beware, stay away, and spend your hard earned money on a restaurant where they still enjoy cooking. If you're feeling like Asian style food think of Pho Vp across the street. Much better taste, experience and value.   This place is a total disappointment. I'd like my money back."}
{"text":"Flavour is ok. Service for delivery great but this is a Chinese food restaurant who does Thai. Not authentic, right down to the food colouring that made my shrimp green in the green curry. Not impressed. If you are looking for Thai, choose another restaurant."}
