{"text":"Celebrated Taco Tuesday today by trying Ni De Aqui Ni De Aya after reading about them in the Phoenix New Times. Had some delicious tacos al pastor that included pineapple, onion and cilantro with your choice of green or red salsa, but couldn't pass up the opportunity to order their famous Pambazo. This awesome torta sandwich came with perfectly toasted and spicy bread filled with carne asada, pinto beans, lettuce, cotija cheese, & crema fresca. It was the perfect mix of flavors and textures. So glad we got to try it and we'll be back now that we know we can find them behind the McDonald's on 7th St. And McDowell on Tuesdays from 11:15 am to 1:30 pm."}
{"text":"A wonderful example of authentic street tacos with accompaniments you'd expect from an upscale establishment."}
{"text":"Great street tacos and the pambazo was totally new to me. All very tasty! The owner is nice and friendly too. All around a great food truck."}
{"text":"This truck was in the place of \"Gay Tacos\" tonight and I drove all the way to the location and they only had al pastor. No carne or even pollo .... despicable. Somehow they consider themselves a taco truck? Yeahhhh never, peace out."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos and aguas frescas! Taco Tuesday never tasted better  the vegan taco is exceptionally yummy and their service is superb. You can find the truck at the Phoenix Birth Center on Tuesdays from 11:30-1pm!"}
{"text":"One of the better Mexican food / taco trucks I've ever enjoyed. Quesadilla was top notch."}
{"text":"Great people plus great food equals amazing. Didn't hurt that prices were reasonable too.

My husband and I split the special flautas and pambaso and we were full and satisfied happy customers. 

My personal delight is when food isn't masked with salty or oily or presentations, and it's just...solid food, and they did just that."}
{"text":"Excellent food truck! Had this amazing bread dipped in red enchilada sauce, with carne asada, beans, lettuce, etc. Just the right amount of spice. Would definitely seek this food truck out for this meal again. Thank you!"}
