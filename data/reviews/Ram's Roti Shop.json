{"text":"Watch out for the hot sauce! I always get the boneless chicken roti. The owners are from Trinidad so the food is very good and authentic.  The place is a clean hole (if you get that) but that's where all the good foods are located. Roti is very good and wish it was a bit bigger because I want some more after I'm done. But it is a good size portion.  It is a ways off from downtown but I would think of Ram's when I'm eating a roti somewhere else."}
{"text":"Ruby & Ram make the best roti outside of Trinidad...it is all wonderful...if you are new to roti- boneless chicken roti is a safe bet...say \"little peppa\"  lol- if you are like me and are  a Trini to da' bone- make me peppa hot hot hot...I like to cry when I eat.   The food is good, the place is clean & the roti is made with love!!!  Ruby has even been know to help package the roti for traveling to the States...how do I know?  Well my dear friend from Toronto brings me Ram's Roti when I am between visits!!!"}
{"text":"Absolute best roti in the world no contest.  Tasted like grandma made it - and that's because she did!"}
