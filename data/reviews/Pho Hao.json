{"text":"The moment I walked in, I had a flashback from while I was visiting Vietnam a few years ago. (Except this place is much larger than any of the phó places I went into in Vietnam). Anyways, that's beside the point.

The wicker chairs are tacky, but I liked it. Thought it was a nice touch:

The food! Tasted like how I remembered phó tasted like in Vietnam. But beware! They give copious amount of food! I ordered a large, and when I got my food, it looked as if the cook just kept stuffing food into the bowl until it over flowed! (Don't you just love a restaurant that just wants to make sure you are fed well?). Well I am barely able to move from over eating at this moment.

Caution: they do put tremendous amount of green onions in the soup. If you don't like onions, make sure you tell them."}
{"text":"We walked in, and were seated very quickly. She had water in her tray as we were being seated which was nice. 

The service here is very fast! 

I ordered the lunch special: salad roll and BBQ pork with spring roll vermicelli and a pop for only $11.99. The dish was very good! There prices are a little bit more expensive compared to other pho restrauants, but I would go back."}
{"text":"The soup tasted like their dishwasher chemical, soapy bleach. The beef was too coarse and thickly cut so it was hard to chew. The taste score would be 2/5."}
{"text":"When you walk into this restaurant, you see tables with wicker chairs. I wasn't sure how the food would be but my colleague frequently eats here and said it's good so definitely worth a try.  The menu offers a variety of Vietnamese subs, noodle soups, vermicilli bowls, and vegetarian options.  The prices are more than any other Vietnamese restaurant I've been to but from what I could see, you get lots of food.

I decided to try the noodle soup with beef balls and rare beef.  It came in the regular size for $9.99 or large for $10.99.  The soup arrived shortly after ordering and the broth was flavourful and good to enjoy.  There was plenty of sliced beef and beef balls as well.  It was a hearty meal which I really enjoyed.  For this price though, I could get a simliar meal elsewhere so I'm not sure I would return if I lived in Calgary.  

Service was good as it was speedy and friendly.  I appreciated that as the same can't be said at other Vietnamese restaurants."}
