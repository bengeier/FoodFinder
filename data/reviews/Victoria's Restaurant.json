{"text":"So this is my 3.5 star review of their Afternoon Tea.  My friend and I had a great time here but unlike other Yelpers we only had the option of sitting outside the restaurant.  It's not that bad but being in the lobby with hotel guests walking about the lobby is distracting and I think it puts all the high tea guests somewhat on display. 

They have a number teas, each with its own brief description which makes it easier to know the differences between all of them.  The teas come in fancy and lovely teapots that makes you want to stick that pinky out when you take a sip.
My friend and I selected The King's Tea which came with a number of finger sandwiches and pastries. I have uploaded a snapshot of the menu for your reference. My favourite was the tarragon infused chicken finger sandwich, raspberry passion fruit trifle and molten chocolate cherry tartlet. The tartlet only had a slight cherry flavour which I prefer so I enjoyed it.  The scones came with devonshire cream & strawberry preserves  were good but I prefer the ones you get at the Windsor Arms - the devonshire cream is to die for. 

Service was good as the waiters came often to fill up our teapots when needed.  I'd go back but would make the request to sit in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here for a Saturday lunch with friends during Winterlicious. Didn't see much of the restaurant interior itself as we were seated at a nice round table in the immense lobby of the King Edward Hotel.

The three-course prix fixe menu had a good variety of choices. I started with an onion and winter squash tart which we all agreed was excellent - this was nearly everyone's selection.  My main course was a thick and tasty grilled cheese sandwich on sour dough bread with a generous serving of greens with roasted pears and Stilton cheese. The group favourite was the fish stew, although I would have called it a seafood stew given that it also included shrimps and mussels. For dessert I opted to have the coffee and biscotti, but the group favourite was the deliciously creamy chocolate pudding. The waiter ended up serving coffee to everyone who wanted one and also brought out an extra pudding for some of us to share so that we all could try it.

Service was excellent, with the exception that the wait staff had to reach across the table at times because there was very little room behind our chairs. Perhaps if the table had been positioned better this wouldn't have been an issue. As I mentioned the waiter was good to us with some extras so I was happy to give him a generous tip.

All-in-all it was a very enjoyable lunch. We stayed quite awhile after the actual meal was over but at no time did I get the indication that the staff wanted us to vacate our table. People started arriving for afternoon tea which I hear is also very good here so we plan to come back sometime for that!"}
{"text":"I booked tea for four for my pregnant sister in law - as all of us had been to the other teas in the city we wanted to try the King Eddy. The problems began making an appointment as no one was ever around to answer the phone to take a reservation and it took two voicemails and 3 days to have a call returned. After a few calls back and forth to confirm allergies, dietary restrictions and that we would be having the kings tea I was really looking forward to the afternoon. When we arrived the hostess seemed very confused almost as if they didn't normally do tea. When they seated us the table was only set for 3, a minor detail but at tea I don't expect those details to be looked. Great selection of delish teas and beautiful cups and saucers. Our pregnant waitress made a very judgemental comment towards my pregnant sister in law regarding drinking decaf which while she meant it to be nice was way out of line and inappropriate. The sandwiches and scones were delicious but unfortunately both the rude and clueless staff and loud atmosphere (huge tables of teenagers taking photos, singing happy bday etc who should have been in a private room) ruined our experience and we took everything to go for a lovely time at home. Will never return or recommend."}
{"text":"I drink decaffeinated tea so I tried the Mountain Berry. This tea was kind of gross. It didn't really taste like tea. I think maybe little kids might enjoy it more. Our server did bring us a box of tea leaves in jars for us to sniff to help us with our choice. The Mountain Berry just didn't taste as great as it smelled.

Onto the scones: you get a regular scone with the powdered sugar on top which was good. Very light and fluffy. I was hoping for it to be a little warmer to seem more fresh. The other scone was harder and had a lemon glaze on the top. I didn't care too much for this scone but perhaps this is just because I don't care too much for lemon flavored sweets. 

Not much to say about their strawberry jam. It was like any other jam you buy at the market. Their devon cream was yummy!

What made me disappointed was their finger sandwiches. They seemed very ordinary and not as elegant as I expect for high tea. Their tarragon infused chicken with charred corn and avocado really stood out though. It tasted a bit like curry.

I think what stood out the most at Victoria's was there desserts. Usually what gets me at high tea is of course the tea, the devonshire cream, and the delicious sandwiches. However the desserts were probably the best part of this experience. I don't even like desserts and I really enjoyed the ones here except the madeleine (because it had no taste). 

Overall, this is a spacious place which is good for a large group of high tea-ers or even if you wanna just relax with your gal pal. I think the dress code is lax enough for you to bring you male friends and family without them feeling this is too girly of an event."}
{"text":"I had high tea here with a party of 5 over easter weekend. Meh! I was not impressed. For me, high tea is an indulgence - it's an opportunity to relax and enjoy some fine tea, delectible edibles and lap in a bit of luxury. This was not my experience with the King Eddy. 

First of all, let me say that I've been for lunch before and had a wonderful experience!. This tea experiece tainted my impression, though. We were seated in the lobby of the hotel, which might not be so bad except that it was a busy easter weekend and we got to enjoy the sights and sounds of people setting up for a busy easter Sunday brunch/a wedding. Wahoo. Just the type of \"luxury\" I was expecting. *note: Sarcasm!* The tea was great (each of us ordered the King's Tea), the food was good, the service was alright, but the atmosphere was severly lacking. For a casual tea time on a non-busy weekend I'm sure it would be fine, but I wouldn't go again in hopes of a luxurious high tea experience."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for a bachelorette party weekend with some friends and we decided at the last minute to go have tea. Unfortunately, our first choice was booked solid for the weekend, so I Yelped to find another option. Victoria's popped up and a phone call later, we had a reservation for 4.  Tea starts at 2:30pm and we were able to get a reservation for 2:45pm, which added an extra star in my book because they were able to fit us in.  

The scones were delicious, and by far our favorite from the food options, although the rest of the food was good as well.  Service was good as well and there were lots of options for tea.

Tips: You don't have to order a tea set for everyone in your group...at least we didn't.   Of course, it depends on how hungry you are as it isn't a lot of food, but it was filling enough for us.  We ordered 2 tea sets and 2 extra pots of tea for 4 people."}
{"text":"I've been to the King Edward a couple of times for their afternoon tea and although it's not bad, it's not the greatest either. 

We were seated in the Victoria restaurant, which is a rather dull dining space. When calling to book, ask if they are opening up the ballroom, as this is the nicest space to dine in. Make sure you're not in the lobby - it's drafty and cold in the winter and there's zero ambience because you're in a lobby! 

The table setting is very lovely with beautiful porcelain cups and saucers, silver strainer and our waitress even matched our sandwich plates to our cups. When we taken to our table, I noticed that the glasses of water were already pre-poured. This struck me as a touch lazy since usually the server comes, introduces themselves, distributes menus and fills up the water. All of my friends commented that the seats were a bit low.

The tea selection only had a choice of 12 teas to choose from, all very standard and nothing particularly exciting. I hesitate to say \"boring\" since they are serving a traditional-style afternoon tea so this isn't the place to come if you're looking for something \"adventurous\" in terms of tea blends. A box of tea samples was presented to us to smell. Our table only ordered the King Edward blend (Ceylon black tea with jasmine and rose) and the Chai. The loose tea leaves were thrown in the pot and allowed to steep, but I don't think their water was hot enough for any of our black teas. All our teas came in identical white Wedgewood teapots that were so oddly finished and light that we thought they were plastic! The design of the teapots was dreadful as tea would pour out the top of the lid as well as through the spout.

All of us ordered the King's Tea, which is their standard Afternoon Tea. They have a lighter option as well as a Children's version as well. 

The sandwiches were presented first and they were very tasty. There were 5 choices and all of them delicious. Then our server brought over a 3-tiered stand with scones and desserts. The scones were very good, though the texture of the raisin/currant scone was excellent! One of the tiny details I look for when I go out for High Tea is a separate utensil presented with the clotted cream or Devonshire cream for serving. Most places neglect this, but it makes the dining experience much nicer since you don't get cream all over the knife that you apply the fruit preserves with. I enjoyed all of the desserts, though none of them stood out as absolutely amazing. 

I would have liked if there was something light to finish off with, like some fresh fruit scattered on the 3-tiered stand. There was a half a strawberry as a garnish, which had been sliced so that each guest could have 1/4 of a strawberry.

Overall the experience and setting were nice. This isn't my favourite place for Afternoon Tea in Toronto, but it's an acceptable venue if the Windsor Arms is fully booked and I want something more traditional than the Red Tea Box.

Please note that they don't accept debit, ONLY credit cards and cash. Washrooms are located outside of the restaurant (in the hotel lobby). There is step-free access from the street and cloak room is available. Tea starts at 2:30, and my group of 4 booked for 3:30pm. Don't plan on staying longer than 5:30 because the staff will give you subtle hints to leave (such as leaving the bill on the table, cleaning up tables next to you and setting up or tomorrow's breakfast!)."}
{"text":"Wonderful array of teas and delicious treats. Be prepared to come hungry and leave full! While the high tea is quite pricey it is delicious. 
The service is impeccable and be prepared to be waited on hand and foot. If you're planning a fun day in Toronto, I would highly recommend making a stop for high tea!"}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch at the King Edward Hotel's \"Victoria's\" restaurant was fantastic.

The food was spectacular:  a huge spread, divided into 3 sections (hot foods, cold foods & desserts).  Crab claws, beef wellington, lamb leg, omelette station, smoked fish, oysters, cheeses, salads and a gourmet selection of seasonal sweets to finish it all off.

The brunch is held in a grand room with large windows and high ceilings.  Comfortable and clean decor, white linen and silverware.  The atmosphere is somewhat mature without being snotty (there were no kids running around or loud, obnoxious people).

Starting the day with a perfect Sunday brunch is hard to beat.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We had a special occasion to celebrate, so I booked a reservation at Victoria's for high tea.

We were given the option of sitting in the hotel lobby area, or inside.  Although the lobby option offers much more sunlight, we opted for inside since the outside area was pretty full.  The inside offered much more privacy and was quieter.

We selected the King's tea which includes scones with devil's cream, mini sandwiches (egg salad, cucumber and two types of salmon) and dessert pastries (chocolate pistachio, cheesecake, lemon tart, heart cookie with raspberry jelly, madeleine cookie).  An excellent variety and quite a large portion!  They don't skip out on presentation either.

Great selection of teas.  You each get your individual tea pot.  I selected the organic green - nice and light.

Every inch of the restaurant was beautifully decorated with interesting artwork.  The china is unique and delicate and the chairs are extremely comfortable.

Service was fantastic.  Our teapots were constantly refilled with hot water and our server took away the extra plates as we made our way through each stage.

As expected, high tea is a little more expensive than you might expect for some tea and biscuits, but the experience is definitely worth it!  Also, we were so full by the time we were done that we only needed a light dinner, many hours later."}
{"text":"The high tea is anything but a true high tea experience. This does not compare to the high tea at Peninsula in Hong Kong, the Fairmount down the street or the Windsor Arms uptown. While it is the least expensive of the previous mentioned, it still a pound of flesh and should be delivered with more respect. Unfriendly  service and hard to catch the waiter's attention. I would not go back for high tea. I think they use the afternoon tea as a training ground for new staff, that could be the only explanation. My brunch experience was much different and I will write a separate review for that."}
{"text":"Went for a Winterlicious lunch.   Very comfortable setting in dining room, great service, excellent food.    Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I was expecting more from this place...but it's just \"A-OK.\" Food is nice but nothing impressive; tea doesn't have too much varieties. The most important thing I consider for afternoon tea--the ambience/atmosphere-- here is not as good as i would imagine. Perhaps because we had a large party sitting next to us and they were pretty loud and had people walking around/taking pics all the time... One good thing is they didn't kick us out even though we stayed for 3 hours (I heard that for Windsor you can only stay up to 2 hours for afternoon tea); but they did stopped adding hot water to our teapots at some point."}
{"text":"As a back-up to afternoon tea at the Fairmont, a girlfriend and I came here for tea. Before coming I called to make a reservation and asked the hostess if it was ok if we just did tea and maybe some scones but not a full afternoon tea meal - she said they were more than happy to accommodate a la carte orders.

However, when we got there and ordered tea and asked about ordering some scones our waitress was pissed. She repeated about three times with an annoyed expression \"ok, so you are JUUUST having tea?\" and when I said \"yes and possibly scones or something. The hostess said this was possible.\" she ripped our plates off the table and made us feel so stupid for not having the full tea menu. 

My friend and I both felt pretty embarrassed even though we called ahead to check that this was ok. The waitress brought us our teas but wouldn't take an order for any bites from us, and didn't tend to us any further. 

When we left to pay (had to ask the hostess for the bill as our waitress wouldn't come to us) I double checked with the hostess that it is possible for people to come in for tea only...she said again they were happy to do this. When I mentioned that it had upset our waitress she explained that the waitress was just upset because it meant her gratuity would be smaller. Obviously, we already knew why she was pissed from the start but then for the hostess to just say it and act like it was ok to treat us like that was a bit weird. The hostess was very nice, don't get me wrong - but I just was confused why she would justify this waitresses bad attitude. 

I wouldn't recommend the King Eddy to anyone - obviously because I was made to feel very embarrassed and stupid. Aside from this the hotel just didn't feel very historic or special like the Fairmont or Windsor. There is an ok selection selection of teas but both that we chose tasted like they had lost their flavour. I  had the King Eddy Special Blend and my gf had the Floral Jasmine which she said was good but a bit weak as well. 

All in all, I will never return. 1 star only for the host being smiley...and because Yelp won't let me give 0 stars."}
{"text":"I've you've seen my review of High Tea at Moroco Chocolat in Yorkville, you'll know I was turned off of the whole idea for a while. I think I was there in August. 

I had a great experience at Victoria's in the lobby of the King Edward Hotel which is now part of the Meridien chain of hotels. 

I went with three friends on a Sunday afternoon. The service was slow, but I think that's part of the tea experience. I don't think you're supposed to rush through it like you're in the mall food court, though we're all inclined to do so from time to time. Ah, to be European and start eating dinner at 10 p.m. 

They have a diverse tea menu. We all ordered the Nutcracker Tea which included petits fours, cocktail sandwiches, scones and preserves and devon cream. Everything was delicious and fresh and their selection of herbal teas was plentiful. 

Their High Tea service also runs a maxmimum of $35 per person, which, when contrasted against places like Moroco or Windsor Arms, is downright cheap (but not cheap....). 

Since there are few places in Toronto that offer High Tea and I have now been to 3 of 4 of the ones I know about, this ranks as my top choice. 

What I feel is important to add to this review is that normally at High Tea, I feel like I'm either at a geriatric convention or in a weird wealth time-warp that I don't belong in but have been somehow sucked into. Not the case the the King Edward, a wide array of people, including lots of children (a little girl was having a Tea Party for her birthday!), lots of tourists and lots of plain ole Torontonians having tea. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Did the Winterlicious lunch here. Definitely a good value for money menu at this place. We were seated at the big lobby.
Ambience - nice - cosy
Food - good - menu was simple and the food came right
Service - was pretty good - some waiters may need to brush up their English language skills but overall still good. Credit must be given - i got an additional pudding although I ordered the coffee as my desert. Thanks to the waiter who was really kind I must say..."}
{"text":"Ambiance: 5/5, everything was lovely. I was seated too close to the entrance though.

Service: 5/5, server was understanding and didn't involve himself with us too much. It was funny actually; he thought my friends were dating and it was sort of awkward for them.

Food: 4/5, delicious. If you have a small stomach, don't eat prior to coming in. I felt so full mid-meal and I didn't order too much (I usually would since I'm a fan of desserts, sandwiches, finger foods in general). Scones were the highlight of my meal. Tea was excellent."}
{"text":"Even as an adult, it's fun to dress up.  One of the things you have to try before you die, is a high tea.  Steeped in tradition as much as the Earl Grey that is ordered, it's an experience that you must garb up for, put on as many faux airs as you can, and find a venue that's appropriate.  Forget any wing night that you may have gone to, it's time for some high-falootin' classy place, and Victoria's at the King Edward Hotel (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/le-meridien-king-edward-toronto), is probably the place in Toronto to do so.

Doffing a suit, dress, or what have you, start by the stroll through the marbled foyer of the King Edward.  Upon arrival at Victoria's, confirm your reservation (a must) and follow the staff to your table.  Since I'm not a member of the Toronto aristocracy (though I do know a joke that has the word \"aristocrat\" in it), and certainly not a product of new, old, or any money for that matter, it's nice to go in undercover and enjoy a taste of high society.  It's also a great place to see the folks for whom high tea is not an event, but the norm.

The tea assortment is lavish and the range of sandwiches and pastries are well portioned and delicious.  Though a bit pricey (and well, truly, what did you expect?), it's worth the experience of the elegance and tradition.  I look forward to bringing my mom here some time, if for no other reason, to see what she looks like in gloves and a hat."}
{"text":"I had a nice time having 'high tea' today at the King Eddy.  We had reservations and were seated in the lobby (wish it was inside the ballroom).   Anyway, the service was  lovely and our server was very attentive.   We ordered the 'King's Tea' and finished it off with no problem.  Food was delicious.  I really liked how our server took the time to explain our meal before we started.  I felt like that was excellent customer service."}
{"text":"My team of 4 businesspeople chose this restaurant, located in the King Edward hotel because we had a coupon for 50% off the food prices, which were otherwise higher than our per diem would have allowed.

The food was lackluster and in some cases just weirdly served.  I had a chicken over bok choy served as if it were a soup in a tureen but which had a quarter chicken with bones that had to be cut - which was impossible in the bowl and messy to boot.

The service was painfully slow and our waiter - any waiter, in fact - disappeared for long stretches."}
{"text":"I was there with all my bridesmaids.  Good place to hang out but not a lot of decors for high tea. Simple tea sets and plain looking overall appearance.  I guess dress code isn't an issue there, saw someone wearing knit sweater, street wear style.  Scones were remarkable but the salty weren't great, felt a bit dry.

Overall it was a great experience because I was with 4 of my besties!"}
{"text":"Came here for the afternoon tea. Ordered the kings tea which came with a pot of tea, mini sandwhiches, mini desserts and scones to finish off (or whatever order you prefer to eat). 

They have a nice selection of teas to choose from (16 in order which took me forever to decide on one). I like that they have mini sampler bottles for you to smell before you order. 

The mini fingerling sandwhiches were tasty. The chicken wardorf salad was my fave and had a lovely sophisticated tasted. The three others were more standard - tuna, egg salad and smoked salmon. 

On the top tier was an array of desserts. A chocolate cake topped with ganache, a tiramisu, and some tarts. On the bottom tier was a lovely plain scone and chocolate chip scone. 

Ambiance is lovely and so are the tea cups. I've been to a couple other places for afternoon tea and this one does the sandwhiches the best. This one is also a lot quieter than the other places so works if you are looking for something relaxing and to have a conversation."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for High Tea with my girlfriend and it's a cute spot for afternoon tea and catching up with friends. I had the sandwich selection and it's quite delicious. However, it's not he best high tea experience I've had in the city. But I still recommend to try it just for the sake of the experience."}
{"text":"I went here for high tea on Sunday. I was pleasantly surprised by the high end ambiance, selection of tea and sandwiches, and the fact they had free coat check service. Tea ranged from $35 to $75 dollars per person. Once we were seated we had a great presentation of local and international tea samples which were placed on our table so we can SNIFF as much as our hearts desired and then choose one that was satisfactory to our taste buds. My friend and I both ordered the chocolate truffle tea which was Devine and was also served in proper tea cups and plates and was accompanied with three tier tower consisting of scones, jams, sandwiches, and jellies...

We were pleased with the service we received and will be definitely back here again!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came for afternoon tea.  We were sat down in the hotel lobby, it felt very strange.  had the King's Tea and Ploughman's High Tea.  The King's Tea sandwiches were just ok, the pastries selection wasn't great.  The Ploughman's High Tea was gross and not worth the money.  I felt like I was cheated after the underwhelming meal, would not go back for afternoon tea."}
{"text":"We went at the end of November so the decor was very festive and made the experience magical.
The server and hostess were both very kind and had good sense of humour.
The free coat check is a nice touch.
The plush chairs made with royal purple upholstery were very comfortable and fancy.
The food was plentiful; they have an excellent vegetarian selection and they make good use of local ingredients depending on the time of year.
I left feeling very full and didn't need to eat for the rest of the day.
The devon cream and preserves were delicious and fresh.
I loved the china and the tea selection. 
You get to learn more about the teas prior to choosing by sniffing them and reading about their notes.
Would like to see more herbal options or white teas.
Definitely going back with my sister for her birthday!"}
{"text":"My family and I booked a Sunday brunch after Christmas at the King Edward Hotel and it was definitely a family focused event. The main ball room was about 75% filled and it ran the entire spectrum in terms of family age groups. You had young toddlers all the way up to elder family members as patrons and the food selection was approachable for everyone.

There was a charcuterie station, cold and smoked seafood station, cheese and cracker, roasted vegetable table, fresh salad station, meze table, viennosorie table, hot breakfast area, hot lunch table ( 3 carving stations, 2 proteins, 1 vegetable pasta, and several hot vegetable sides), fresh fruit, smoothie, and juice table, and lastly... the desserts! So overall, food was plentiful, interesting without being too obscure for a young palette, fresh (I commend the kitchen staff who were literally walking non stop replenishing all plates that were down to 30% filled with a freshly filled one), and well seasoned for a buffet.

The buffet was nicely spread out and the tables environment was spacious so we would not be bumping into our neighbours. The atmosphere was definitely festive with the many trees and large nut crackers decorating the entire 2 storied ballroom. Though the setting was formal, the service was relaxed and informal (perhaps a touch too formal from certain individuals). Most of the staff were smiling and pleasant and very quick to refill cups and glasses.

I found the viennoiserie surprisingly good. The croissant, danishes, and other pastries were buttery, crackly crispy exterior, with loads of lovely layers puffed inside. I would say that it's better than most bakeries I've been to in Toronto. They weren't the horrible pale palor but instead they were on the dark golden brown that exudes flavour.

The seafood consisted of decent smoked salmon, smoked trout, deshelled chilled shrimp (about 31-40 size), grilled calamari salad, South American influenced ceviche style scallops and shrimp salad, chilled poached salmon, and another smoked fish I cannot recall. Overall, it was solid but not awe inspiring. Everything was cooked and prepared well. I did like the scallops with the citrus and chimchurri like vinaigrette.

The breakfast area was definitely better than other places I've been to. Crispy waffles spiced with Christmas spices and orange with maple syrup. Cinnamon french toast with a lovely custard interior, eggs Benedict was good (eggs were cooked well... yolks were liquid gold to the nice hollandaise but the english muffin was a bit too moist/chewy), and the freshly made omelettes were cooked exactly to order and filled with tons of veggies and cheese.

The carving station was composed of a porchetta, roasted lamb, and a beef wellington. The beef wellington was pink throughout. My family liked the beef but not pastry.. perhaps it was held too long? The porchetta was well received by the table but I'm not sure how authentic it is. Lamb was lamb... it's a rare occasion when I truly think it shines. Here, it's ok.

The warm lunch items were surprisingly good. They had a roast salmon in a light herb cream sauce. The salmon was not dry and the sauce was bright instead of heavy. The chicken was roasted then combined with a South Asian style sauce (Thai influence). The chicken was moist and flavourful... the toddler ate a whole chicken leg and he can be picky. Considering how poor this section could be (and experienced at other buffets), this one was far better than I would have thought possible.

The desserts had some bright spots as it has a Christmas influence on some unique items. My favourite was a chestnut pavlova like morsel. I love chestnuts and it's rare to see it being used so I was quite happy to see large swirls of chestnut on top of a crispy meringue. Other items include a maple tart with raisin, a mincemeat tart with strusel, creme caramel, creme brulee, 3 normal cakes (chocolate truffle, red velvet, almond mocha) and 2 Christmas inspired cakes (yule log complete with meringue mushrooms, and a chocolate mousse one). They also had a fruit mousse ... passion fruit perhaps? Oh chocolate mousse, 2 types of Italian cookies, and I'm sure I'm missing another type of dessert but at this point, I was venturing into sugar overload.

Overall, I felt that it was a nice place to have a family affair in a great storied location with plentiful and fresh food. The prices was $53/adult, half price for children, and free for toddlers and younger. Comparing this to notes and pictures of Stock (which is the other brunch buffet in the same price range), I feel this is far more approachable and enjoyable for a family personally. Though, I did see many tables with late 20s just laug"}
