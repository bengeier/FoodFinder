{"text":"At first glance of this place I had high hopes.  Nice enough decor, nothing fancy. The menu alone is quite extensive, comparable only to another mile high menu Ikes out of Tempe. After deliberating over 100+ sandwiches, ordered the 'Hat Trick'. To my surprise, was perfect. Was almost like a Alfredo pasta squaw with chicken toasted bread. Where to go wrong? 
The only reason I can't give it a 5 stars, it appeared understaffed & just a few minor details that matter. Plus $14 & some change is a little much for a young man like myself. I do appreciate a good meal so,I came through for a new place.  So with that, I can only hope to come back and be impressed once again.  Who can say? I'm hoping for another well done sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is amazing,  I love the Customer service and the food is amazing as well. I will be back. By the way try the Thanksgiving. Great sandwich and the potato salad is amazing"}
{"text":"I wrote that I dislike this place and they tried to tell me that I don't.. Then accused me of slandering them.. Called a legal team.. All of this because I don't like coconut flour in cookies and couldn't remember the Yelp password to my primary account, decided to make one and review things I'd already reviewed to help set up my feed the way it was. What's best is I even have screen shots of every moment to prove it! So fair to say this business completely bullied me into corner because they didn't like my Yelp review and thought I was fake. So I guess I'm here to say this is the best place I've ever ordered delivery from twice in my entire life."}
{"text":"We were stopping by to pick up sandwiches for lunch on our way to Slide rock. The service was so great! They explain everything and even give up extra bag of chips and drinks for yelp offer. The sandwich portions are HUGE ! J had world famous chicken and I had tuna. We both love it! I like the tuna salad since it was not too mayo-ee (if that's even a word =D) . I can taste chunk of tuna. We got the irish cream firehouse cookies and it was a perfect picnic lunch !"}
{"text":"If you plan on having this restaurant deliver to you, expect an extremely long wait.  I placed the order at 12:30 pm on a Saturday afternoon.  Was told to expect the delivery by 1:35 pm. By 2 pm I called and asked where our food was.  They claimed that they had only 1 delivery driver to take multiple orders out and I just needed to wait a few more minutes.  That the driver had already left.  By 2:15 the driver finally showed up.  To make this worse, there were items that I had paid for that weren't in the delivery.  Of course by the time this was found, the delivery driver was long gone.  Overall, delivery and service is sub-par.  Food, (assuming everything was included) would be slightly better than a subway sandwich."}
{"text":"My wife went in 15 minutes before closing. Rob and April (Owners) had let the staff go early. The were amazing!  Gave my wife some homemade chicken soup and bread pudding. Incredibly accommodating. You have to try this place."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place so we came for our first time. This is going to be long because there was so much wrong with this experience. The guy working tells us that they're out of roast beef and tomatoes while we're looking at the menu, so my boyfriend orders one of their tuna sandwiches. Then the guy tells us they're also out of tuna, and that \"you can only get those at the beginning of the week because we run out fast\". Okay. Would've been helpful to know that five minutes ago but it's fine. We order our sandwiches and mention the Yelp coupon for chips and a drink.. when they tell us their soda machine is broke and all they have are Hi-C cans of Diet Coke. so we decide we'll get the food to go. The lady behind us orders and goes through the same thing, being told they don't have the ingredients for her sandwich. About 10 minutes later they told us they're out of French rolls.. which they'd offered specifically when we ordered. So we make yet another compromise and keep waiting. Another lady working there went to the bathroom still wearing her apron, then touched me on the shoulder before going back behind the counter (gross). A couple minutes later they had to tell the other customer they *still* didn't have the ingredients to make her order after she'd been waiting for a while. Apparently they don't keep track of their inventory here. I won't be returning!"}
{"text":"Bomb sandwiches!  I am a big guy, and these guys make huge sandwiches!  I'll be back again! Great service!!!"}
{"text":"Not at all impressed! 
Have come in twice and each time was highly disappointed with the quality & taste of their sandwiches, especially for the price.
The whole place had a rather weird vibe to it, can't quite put my finger on it. It was empty & no other customers were eating there or patronizing the establishment, either of the times I came in.  
The woman who helped me was not very personable and I thought she seemed very unprofessional and phony. She claimed to be the owner of the establishment but she was shifty-eyed and wouldn't look me in the eyes, kept fumbling around with her hair and adjusting her shirt and just basically odd. Got the vibe she was strung out on something. I won't be back. Save your money & go elsewhere.

*** In reply to the owner Amber Walter's response to me. She is saying she has been in the hospital June 11-15th, therefore an impostor claiming to be her, is who I dealt with. I never gave the precise dates I was in, but my two visits were not during the 11th-15th of June. I have not been in for a couple of weeks. The woman in the photo, Amber Walter is definitely the person who took my order and the person I interacted with. Her reply is a blatant lie and trying to discredit my review. I stand behind what I originally shared and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good stuff about the great food and outstanding service at hookmeup.   I've been in several times and have tried several sandwiches.  All of them have been stellar. Fresh ingredients. Hundreds of combinations.   All brought to you by a super-friendly and always helpful staff.  The only negative is that they need more customers.  

Oh, and there might be crack in the signature secret silly sauce!   Keep it up hookmeup, I have hundreds of more sandwiches to try."}
{"text":"Really good sub sandwich. First quality ingredients. Very pricy however. A combo will set you back $15. The bright side I couldn't eat anything for the rest of the day after a lunch here. Really big, filling sandwich."}
{"text":"A Scrumptious, delicious and full bodied sandwich with tasty, tasty fixins.  The Bruski Sandwich, it's a winner if you like/love as I do juicy tender chicken, lettuce if you desire, cheese and crispy bacon, lots of it.   Bacon in almost every bite, yummy!  The sassy, sexy, secret silly sauce is amazing attracting the goodness of all the ingredients to the sandwich with pepper jack cheese.  And then in my Operatic voice I sing AHHHHHH Good, if you get my drift.  I love bacon way TOO much!   However I also love a good sandwich and this one qualifies as gourmet.  My granddaughter and I had a Friday luncheon date and decided to stop by Hook Me Up.  I asked the Manager to suggest a good choice.  He suggested for us The Bruski sandwich which will be added to my repertoire(smile), hope that's the right spelling!  We added avocado on half of the sandwich which my granddaughter wanted.  I ended up tasting the avocado and I'm getting it the next time.  The roll was fresh, soft and kushy.  My granddaughter and I both agreed, the sandwich was the Bomb Diggidy.  We loved it; full-bodied meaning big, large, oversized!  Lastly, to our surprise, the manager delivered our take out, right to our table while we were waiting.  I call that Good Hospitality and Great Public Relations Attitudes.
My granddaughter and I had a lovely luncheon date with good food, good company and much loving memories!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to stop for lunch on our way to the airport. The reviews were spot on. This place is awesome! Had the \"famous big 5\" lunch special and it was delicious. As if the food didn't speak for itself, the owners were kind, attentive, and genuinely cared about their restaurant. Hookmeup has definitely made our must-stop list for Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Under new management. Probably the friendliest sandwich shop I've ever been to. Can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Had the Big Tony.  Ingredients were fresh, service was awesome and the sandwich was perfectly crafted.  Price was very reasonable.  I talked to the owner while my sandwich was prepared.  They have tons of sandwich options with unique names.  

I will be back soon.  The price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches and customer service in town. Ingredients are always fresh and have always been greeted with a smile. I've recommended this place to all my friends and family!"}
{"text":"I drive by this place on my way to Daycare so I decided to stop in and check it out. First off the place was dead and I was leery to even order because the other sandwich shop nearby was packed but I always like to try something new so I gave it a shot. The menu was huge so I thought I would try an easy one a Turkey with bacon . No luck, no turkey and he said he didn't really care for that one anyway. I next picked a veggie one because to be honest the place just really had an \" off\"  odor to it and I thought if they don't have any customers the meat, if they had any, would be not as fresh. I asked for it simple, just like on the menu EXCEPT NO TOMATOES. sounded simple enough to me. I waited. waited. waited. He told that he was sorry he had forgot that I wanted no onions. Thats not what I said I told him, I said no tomatoes. He looked at me and said \"  oops\" He then looked at me as if he wanted me to say thats ok I will take it anyway.Well I didn't say that. A very uncomfortable 30 sec followed and he said \" do you want me to make it again minus the onions?  THE ONIONS!  I couldn't believe it. Being the mother of twin boys Im far from impatient but this was really aggravating. I said forget it, he said can I give you free soda or chips?  I said no. I just wanted to get back home and relax . 
   
 Now mind you this was a terribly high priced sandwich as well. I get home to eat my tomato loaded sandwich to find it soggy ( which is why I never order tomatoes) and the bread was stale, stale AND soggy in the middle. what a novel idea for such high priced CRAP. I will never be back again and I guarantee this  establishment won't be around for long. I do NOT recommend."}
{"text":"Edit: Unfortunately HookMeUp is no longer present at the Ahwatukee location. Very sad and upset about this. 

Original post: My wife had surgery and when she woke in her delirious state she says \"I want HookMeUp\". Perhaps the gives you an idea of the overall satisfaction we have had here.

Never felt so genuinely welcomed at a food joint. These guys know their sandwiches and if you don't know what to order or how to build your sandwich, they'll recommend how to do it right! I get something different every time I visit (personal challenge) and it's a struggle... because I come across a new favorite nearly every time.

This is a place I would drive across town for. Fortunately I live nearby!"}
{"text":"My first hand experience:

Ordered a banana and peanut butter sandwich with a caramel apple milkshake. I never received said order because when we went on lunch to pick it up, it took over 30 minutes.  Seriously, over 30 minutes to make a PEANUT butter sandwich? I called the store and asked for a refund due to non receipt. The guy didn't even ask why I wanted my money back and said \"reversal done\" and hung up. I was sure to inform my coworkers and will not return."}
{"text":"It took 30mins for me to receive my sub and the place was not even crowded. My sub which cost $9.98 was far from being worth of value, the shredded chicken was extremely dry. I observed the OWNER of the establishment (Sharon) eat food behind the counter next to the ingredients. She then came around the counter to speak with customers and noticed she was wearing sandals no socks while cooking. After seeing these few things as i waited for my sub it made me feel like the place was unsanitary. But again worst part of all is I waited 31mins for a SUB. . NEVER again will I bring my business or recommend this as a GOOD place to eat.  Its called HookMeUp and i was far from hooked up. Jersey Mikes is much better for the price"}
{"text":"Well our first (and will be our only) visit here was greatly disappointing. Terrible experience. Found a twist tie in the sandwich....

We did the online ordering, when we arrived they hadn't even started on our sandwiches. 
No apologies for the wait.  The staff was extremely disorganized and one staff member yelled at the cashier when they tried to give us the wrong sandwich. I heard one employee ask where the bread was?! The delivery driver walked in while I was there and said she had been trying to make a delivery for the last 45 minutes and couldn't find the place to make the delivery, and the employees discussed how the phone wasn't working to dial in or out.

My sandwich was good-but half a sandwich for $12 seems a little ridiculous-it wasn't that good.

My husband's sandwich looked better size and price wise but he was disgusted to find a twist tie in the second half. And we can't even call to complain, since their phone doesn't work. 

Don't waste your time or money here.

I don't expect to see this place around a month from now."}
{"text":"So this place sucked. Super overpriced sandwiches. Owner was nice as can be, but the product was just really underwhelming. #dumpymurals #dumpmeals"}
{"text":"Great sandwich. Been here a couple of times and haven't had a bad experience yet.  Sandwiches are well done, staff is friendly, and restaurant was clean.  Recommend the Toy Woody. Will eat here again!"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches! Fresh and delicious ingredients, owners were helpful and customized sandwiches. Got the bruski #82, added diced jalapeños and apples, it was an awesome sandwich! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"We are new to AZ and My fiance grabbed us some sandwhiches from here recently.They were good but nothing overly special. I'd say they are more like subs at least what we got. I was surprised when I saw the reciept. Pretty pricey for just a mediocre meal. We didn't dine in so I can't judge the inside only my guy  can but maybe we will dine in if we come back. My fiance said the menu was huge, too much I guess.he just picked one he thought  I'd like since he didn't want to take all day. My sandwhich was huge though and had good sauce. I guess for the price the portion sizes is good."}
{"text":"This was the best Reuben I've had in years.  My wife's rock and roll cheese steak was amazing as well. If I lived near this place, I'd be in a few times a week. Thanks to Yelp on this one. Glad we found it."}
{"text":"The name fits their style 100%. They hook you up with quality sandwich meat, but also bake their own breads in house! Everything I've had was thick and juicy and thinking about it now is even making my mouth water. These guys really know what it means to make a gourmet sandwich. It's not about rushing food out to be scarfed down, their food is to be enjoyed. Several different specialty Coke drinks only sweeten the deal. From a root beer float flavor to their dirty Coke, you just can't go wrong. The staff is also very friendly and helpful when it comes to walking you through their 150 different sandwiches. The hook up doesn't stop there! They didn't even hesitate when asked to donate to charity events that serve orphans and other community projects in the Phoenix area. Overall, it's safe to say they spare no expense when it comes to customer satisfaction. Hookmeup is just a great place to go whether on your lunch break, or meeting with friends. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite sandwich shop in Ahwatukee! I got the Italian and it was delicious! You can tell all the ingredients are cut fresh and the bread is soft and plump. The owner buys cookies from a local fireman who owns his own cookie business so I was happy to support our fireman as well. Great place! I can't wait to bring my dad and husband here! :)"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and the Hat Trick sandwich is amazing!  Honestly, it is the best sandwich I've ever had. The prices are high, but the sandwiches can be pretty large depending on the type you get. I am only able to eat half of a sandwich, so it ends up turning into two meals. There are 150 sandwich types, which is pretty neat but can be overwhelming at first. The employee who served us both times was very nice and offered us free fountain drinks and chips. He even let us try our sandwiches he made, and if we didn't like it he said he would make something else for us. Great customer service and good quality food! Just hope with their prices that they stick around."}
{"text":"Thought we would try a new place and was disappointed. Ordered the Goddess (turkey, bacon, avocado) and was extremely unimpressed. The order took over 15 minutes to make. Bread was not very fresh with a dry and crumbly texture. Bacon was cold (could have been due to the length of time it took to get my sandwich) the turkey was an embarrassment. Veggies were definitely sliced the day before. That had that day in the fridge favor. They were also cut very strange. The onions were cubed and the tomatoes were...... Don't think I'll go back. I gave it two stars because the guy behind the counter was trying."}
{"text":"I will probably never enjoy a sandwich from any other restaurant ever again, hook me up is AMAZING! I've tried four different sandwiches so far and I've loved every single one! Go here and try it right now!!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! Also, the staff couldn't be any friendlier. I work nearby and it's my go-to lunch place. Not once have I come in and not been greeted right away with a smile. Can't beat the service here."}
{"text":"Was not that happy when I decided to try this place just recently. I ask what they recommend and was told the French dip was really good so I decide to go with that and the total comes to over $10! I'm thinking wow this must be a really good sandwich to be that much, so why not I'll give it a try.  Let's just say I didn't even finish the other half that's how disappointing it was, the meat was chewy and the taste was not worth the money spent."}
{"text":"I really like this place!!!while it is a bit expensive,  I feel like it's pretty worth it! The staff was super nice! The decor was a little odd, but the food is super good. That secret silly sauce is to die for! 

We also got free popsicles because it broke 100 degrees! The happy hour deal is pretty sweet too. Totally recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"The Big Italian Brother and the Woodstock Tuna were GREAT. Everything was fresh and tasty. We will visit again soon!"}
{"text":"The food was good, nothing special. Waited 45 minutes for 2 subs. Poor customer service. There are a ton of sandwich options, something for everyone. After waiting so long, the sandwich was soggy and falling apart. Over priced for what you get. $15 for a sub and extra for veggies. Was not impressed."}
{"text":"Been here for lunch yesterday and ordered the lunch special: half sub, large drink with free refills and a choice of either a small bag of potato chips or potato salad.

Man! This sandwich was the best i had for a long long time! Staff is extremely friendly and clearly stand behind their product

Just went back today for more :) definately worth it!

Oh, and they only have a modest list of 150 different subs...."}
{"text":"Went it before the grand opening but still had a great experience. Sandwiches are HUGE and taste great. Crazy mix of flavors."}
{"text":"Decided to try a new sandwich place in Ahwatukee. The place is in the location of an old Quiznos and it shows. The young man at the register struggled to take our order and a older woman who I am assuming is the owner let him fumble instead of stepping in. She apologized however the staff needs more training before going live. 

Next was the price. 2 sandwiches, 2 drinks, 1 bag of chips. ..... $25.00

You have to order by crazy names on the sandwiches. Goddess, wet willy, etc. I just want a turkey sandwich. 

The owner was running sandwiches and came to our table 3 times with other people's food. 

The upside is that the sandwich was good but the price and customer experience will make me go next door to Spinatos"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Definitely come here for the best sandwiches in Ahwatukee (maybe even the best in Arizona)! The food is amazing, and the staff is warm, welcoming, and incredibly friendly. I will definitely be coming back! 

Oh, and try their homemade chili. It's to die for!"}
{"text":"I just visited Hook Me Up. I got \"The Clown\". It was great. The bread was fresh and had the perfect consistency. The blend of chicken and roast beef with the silly sauce made for a real treat. 
My wife had the French Dip. She said the Beef had a good flavor, and the au jous was very nice and flavorful. She is really picky so for her to like it tells me it was top shelf. 
The crew was quick and attentive.  The facility was clean and well lit. 
Prices are 10 bucks on average, but not the fast food level of quality, so worth the price if you want to upgrade.

Changed name. I haven't been able to stop by since."}
{"text":"So, I have been reading some good stuff about Hook Me Up Gourmet Sandwiches at 48th St and Chandler Blvd, so I decided to give them a try. I'm glad I did! I had the Big 5 sandwich and it was delicious! The bread tasted like it had just been baked fresh. The half sandwich is a good size and filled me up. Their potato salad is also very good. The owners are also super friendly and very appreciative of their customers. Next time you think about Jimmy John's or Subway, give Hook Me Up a try and support a local business...you won't regret it!..."}
{"text":"Tried this place today for lunch and it was empty except for 1 table. The menu is quite extensive so I asked the manager for a recommendation.  He recommended the cheesesteak and said it was the \"best\" sandwich ever. I place my order and it took 15 mins before I got my sandwich. Not sure why it took so long as there was no one who ordered before I did.  

The sandwich itself was bland, the cheese was not melted, and the meat itself was a grey, unappetizing color. At a cost of over $12 including tax, the value was definitely not there.  I don't mind paying that amount for a \"gourmet\" sandwich if it was worth it, but this one was subpar at best.  

I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone as there are better options near by."}
{"text":"Pretty good sandwich... The menu is extremely overwhelming. Waaaaay too many options. This may be a good thing for some but I do not like looking through 50+ sandwich options. I got the #61 - Give Peace a Chance. It was good but a ton of bread, kind of filling. The sandwich had very generous amounts of meat, bacon, cheese, lettuce and tomato, as well as dressing. I'd get it again but probably on different bread."}
{"text":"Just fair. No one greeted me when I walked in, not clear where to put in an order. At least acknowledge your customers. My warmed up hot sandwich had lukewarm cheese and cold chicken. Not a great experience overall. 

To be fair they did want to make things right and they are giving me a significant coupon discount to try them again. However I am not going to go out of my way."}
{"text":"Let me break this down on a few factors:

1) menu--BIG selection of sandwiches.  Almost too much.  They definitely have something for everyone...good luck trying to figure out which one to go with.

2) food--mediocre.  The sandwhich wasn't bad but it wasn't good enough to differentiate from the other sandwhich shops. The portion was huge...so you definitely get you $ worth.  However, the overall sandwhich was lacking not.  I had the Reuben and it was drenched in 1000 dressing.  Way too much...need to wipe some off.  

3) service--just ok.  Being the new shop in town you generally get over the top service initially...the good ones sustain it.

4) restaurant--typical deli layout; however, if I owned the place I would have a conversation with the contractor.  Finishes didn't match, woodwork not flush, drain in the middle of the dining area?

Unfortunately,  probably will stick to one of the many other options in Gilbert/Chandler area."}
{"text":"I love this place. The people are really nice and it feels like I'm back home in Nebraska. Lots of meat on sandwiches. I believe on certain days teachers get a discount. And their shakes are good too. The lady makes the best shakes. I came today but some other place was there. I heard they moved and they still delivered but what is the new address.?"}
{"text":"We got the razzle dazzle & three wise guy & not worth the 15 minute wait. Chicken was dry & bread seemed store bought."}
{"text":"Great sandwich! I got the number 1 without salami. It was delicious. I am definitely going to be coming back and getting another one. Thanks again Jason for the sandwiches. My daughter ate all her half too. The only issue with the place is turn on the ac or prop open the door since it's so hot with the oven. I am definitely going to be back!"}
{"text":"I went to try this place with my coworker on our lunch break. I was excited since we don't often get new sandwich places nearby. Their menu consists of 150 items, which is just absurd. Upon arrival there was a large spider hanging from the ceiling, I then ordered two sandwich meals (The Goddess, and Chicken in the red car). The total was roughly $30, which, for two below average meals was ridiculous.  The chips I got had expired on the 2nd of March, and when we recieved our food they put mustard on mine when my receipt stated that wasn't supposed to be on it. I did not get a gourmet sandwhich experience and needless to say Hook Me Up, did NOT hook me up."}
{"text":"We finally tried this place and wow it was great!!! So much to choose from!! My husband had the Italian and I the turkey with cranberry ... So Good! The bread was awesome! The staff from the guy who took our order to the manager were all very nice! Great place , welcome to the Tukee!"}
{"text":"Solid food and good customer service. I came in for lunch and it was pretty busy but still got my sandwich in under 8 minutes (it was a hot one too, a number 16). Bread was good, meat, cheese, and veggies were also delicious. I will give them a second try and start making my way through the other 100 sandwiches soon."}
{"text":"Sandwiches had me dripping.
Great customer service.
Clean place.
Good food. 


There's so many sandwiches to choose from its  amazing I recommend everyone to come to come eat here. Chose sandwich 59 really good.
The best sandwiches in Arizona!!!!!!"}
{"text":"These sandwiches are completely scrumptious. I am not a vegetarian but I got their vegan meatballs and it was so tasty.  Kez behind the counter was friendly and helpful answering all of my questions about the HUGE variety of sandwiches. 

While the price was around $9 for a sandwich it was COMPLETELY worth it.  I know that sentence sounds nuts but it isn't.  Go and eat here.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed sandwiches, salads (any sandwich can be a salad with a choice of greens), and milkshakes four times in the last three months (home delivery and onsite).  The staff is extremely accommodating to whatever your dietary needs or preferences are. The cost is a bit more than average, but the ingredients are better quality than your typical sandwich shop so it is reasonable to pay more. We understand that soon the shop will have a name change without changes to the offerings.  We hope that this wonderful shop will thrive in Ahwatukee so we can continue enjoying delicious, healthy food.  BTW their milkshakes are a must try item, I especially like the Black Cherry Shake and they made me an off menu RootBeer Shake that was also amazing."}
{"text":"We first ordered from here for delivery.  Which was great because there are no other sandwich deliveries in the area.  We liked it so much that the following week we stopped in for a quick bite.  The staff was friendly and everything is delicious."}
{"text":"They have the freshest ingredients for sandwiches. They make a special sauce that would be delicious on any of their sandwiches! My mouth is watering as I type this review. I'm definitely returning and trying some of their other sandwiches. I would recommend them to my friends."}
{"text":"Wow! What a nice sandwich place! 
There menu is outstanding and the choices are almost endless.
Had the Ruben and one of the best I have ever had; prepared perfectly and quickly.
I recommend this place to any  sandwich lover!"}
{"text":"Was driving around looking for a sandwhich olace and rememebered seeing this before. We decided to stop in and wow. Theres around 150 sandwhich choices but they have certain sections that are divided up by the meat. I went with the toy wood, it was so good. The customer service was amazing and its rare to come aa cross it these days."}
{"text":"I was driving around looking for a new place to do lunch and I was caught by the name! I went in without looking at their reviews. The attendant Dylan was super helpful in recommending a sandwich to my liking. I went with \"The one\" which was HUGE and very tasty! I was pleased with my sandwich! It could use some liveness like music or TVs because it was very quiet when I went in but the food and service was great!"}
{"text":"Incredible selection of sandwiches meat, vegan, and vegetarian options. Was told they have 150 different sandwiches. Have never visited and eaten here before and came for lunch. My mom and I were met with exceptional service with someone explaining some of their most popular sandwiches, the options of choosing by meat, and gave helpful suggestions. 

Dined in and even once sitting and trying the sandwich two of their workers came by to check in and see how we liked the sandwiches. I ordered the lunch size of Whooly Bully and was also given a side of their house Silly Sauce (their nut free version of a pesto sauce). This particular sandwich was made on a nice baguette type bread, don't know if all the sandwiches are made on the same type of bread. Couldn't finish even the lunch size and they very nicely bagged the other half to go."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Chaz was great, explaining how they make things. I had the Italian and the meat quality was through the roof."}
{"text":"This review is about two visits I've now made here... 

6/14: First time ever coming here, there are maybe 5 people eating, place smells like something is burning, only one employee working. I walk up to order and he tells me the oven is not working properly, the other employee never showed up, and he has to make a big phone-in order so he won't be able to make me a sandwich unless I want to wait 45 minutes. I have to get back to work, so he offers me a free sandwich to get me to come back. Okay, having a bad day, I'll give it a second chance. 

6/29: Walk in, place smells like something is burning again. Order a turkey, bacon, avocado. Only problem, they're out of turkey! What?? You're a sandwich place, that should not happen. They make it with chicken instead. Get back to my office, no lettuce on the sandwich despite my request to add it and the bread is stiff and stale.

I will be shocked if this place is still in business by the end of the summer. The employees were friendly, but the decor, quality of food, and prices are a total disaster. Almost every sandwich is $11, which is flat out insane for a sandwich shop. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I loved the abundance of vegetarian options. I'm not a fan of fake meats but they do carry vegan chicken and turkey which is nice to see.

I had the Scotsman Sandwich. It was a little rich for my taste with both the cream cheese & avocado but the ingredients were all very high quality, seems like one or the other would be better next time. I loved the amount of fresh avocado slices. I was surprised to find pickles and banana peppers on the sandwich (wasn't listed on the menu), they were easy enough to pick off but the tanginess of both (and the vinegar) didn't really work with pesto and the other creamy ingredients. 

Like most reviews, I loved the potato salad too, it's a very traditional mayo based style with lots of black pepper and big crunchy chunks of celery. 

They were out of chicken noodle soup unfortunately.

The delivery driver was very nice and delivery time was quick, I would guess around 30 mins or so."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Bread is fresh, ingredients are fresh.  No better sandwich in town.  The selection is unbelievable.  Love both the cole slaw and potato salad. Locally owned. Deserves your support"}
{"text":"I work within walking distance of this place, so I took a stroll over to pick up some lunch. The menu reminded me a lot of Ike's Sandwiches as the two are very similar. There is a diverse and robust menu with plenty to choose from for everyone, including the option to make any of the sandwiches a wrap or a salad. They have many choices of bread as well. I ordered \"The One\" (picture posted). 

The food: excellent. Everything is made in front of you. Soups and  pasta/potato salad are homemade, nothing from a can. I saw another reviewer wrote hat she didn't like they used shredded chicken, but this was a winning point for me; I like to know it's actually chicken, not something that resembled chicken or went through a deep fryer. I was very impressed with the quality, look, and taste of the food. 

The service: I was greeted by an older woman who I assume is the owner. She chatted me up and it was nice to get to know her. It's a great experience when you know the restaurant actually cares about what you think, and providing the best product/service possible. So much better than slapping processed food in a bag and saying \"here you go.\"  She cared; that matters. 

The Price: a bit steep if you're comparing it to the $5 Footlong but hey- you get what you pay for. I don't mind shelling out the few extra bucks for homemade food, prepared with care, toward a local business owner then a franchise who good give a rats tail how I feel about their stale bread or prepackaged \"not so fresh\" turkey. The sandwiches are big, mine will feed me for two days, so really, I'm getting the bang for my buck. 

I'll be returning for sure! Is recommend this place to any and all."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The staff are super friendly and the sandwiches are so good! I tried the New York Reuben and it was one of the best reubens I've ever had."}
{"text":"Awesome flavor! They use some sauce that makes the taste pop. I got the three wishes sandwich, stacked high with toppings, it took a couple days to finish this beast of a sandwich. Really clean interior and great service at an unbelievable price for how much meat you get."}
{"text":"We came to this place today because our favorite sandwich shop Ike's was closed for the holiday and this place is sort of a \"knock off\" of Ike's. There was no one else there when we came in, and the girl at the counter was very friendly. She was able to make a recommendation to me and I ended up really liking the sandwich, however, their bread to sandwhich ratio is off and their sourdough wasn't as crusty as I normally like. 
     The place itself is pretty nice, you can tell it wants to be a little fancier than it is, but it's comfortable. The menu is crazy, just like Ike's, there's definitely something for everyone. However, I was disappointed at their cheese selection. Being a gourmet sandwich shop, you'd think they'd have facier cheeses like havarti but they didn't even have mozzarella. 
    Overall, it was OK. This definitely doesn't take place Ike's."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place for the very first time today, and I have to say we were extremely disappointed that we had not been here before! My husband and I both had to completely different sandwiches and both were extremelydelicious. The bread the vegetables the meats, everything you could tell was extremely fresh! We have finally found our favorite sandwich place. And the staff are all very friendly! we really wish we would have tried this place sooner rather than wasting time and money on other sandwich places! If you have never been I highly highly highly highly recommend going here ASAP! Yum!!! And they treated my 20 month old daughter like royalty!"}
{"text":"Lots of choices !  Had Reuben and turkey sandwhich... Both were Excellent.  Very good quality .  We will call in order next time to save time."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time last week and really enjoyed my sandwiches.  As a new veg head, I was happy to see so many meat-free sandwich options.  Sadly, at the time of my maiden visit, the nice lady behind the counter told me that they were totally out of the vegan chicken and turkey....all they had left were the vegan meatballs.  Ok.  I chose the \"Happy Hungry Hobbit\" (Swiss cheese, avocado, and substituting the vegan meatballs for the vegan turkey) and the \"Red Rocket\" (spicy honey dijon, pepper jack cheese, avocado, and the vegan meatballs for the \"chicken\").  Both were really good!  I do understand, though, why some folks are not 100% happy; the wait time was rather long, especially considering I was the only customer in the shop the entire time I was there.  Prices are on the higher side, but the shop claims to use the best, freshest ingredients (and my sandwiches were indeed tasty).  I thought the sourdough bread -- my bread of choice since it was vegan -- was a bit on the hard side.  Overall, I would come back again and try something different as long as I was not in a rush to get anywhere."}
{"text":"Truly one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Everything was incredibly fresh, and innovative! The secret silly sauce is DELISH and homemade! 

I had the Razzle Dazzle sandwich and I couldn't get enough!! It's chicken, bacon, avocado and pepper jack. Bread is fresh, chicken was fresh, and avocado was yummy and green :)"}
{"text":"The chicken in these sandwiches send to be shredded, which is different, but I think I like it a opposed to a whole breast, or sliced deli style.  

\"The one\"was good and spicy.  It was recommended I put out in a tomato wrap, which was quite good."}
{"text":"This is a great place for vegetarians/vegans and any others with dietary restrictions.  I had the \"Golden Gandhi\" which came with Meatless chicken and bacon, BBQ sauce, honey mustard sauce, cheeses and vegetables.  It was a very very solid sandwich.  I do not think you could tell it wasnt real meat.  A little pricey, but considering the extremely limited vegetarian options in the area, definitely worth it.  I will probably come back here once a week or so for lunch."}
{"text":"I visited for the first time yesterday. I was pleasantly greeted and began to look at the menu. WOW! I could have a healthy day or a big chunky cheat day in the same place!! 
As a small business operator myself, I appreciate the little things done to keep patrons happy. 
I have already spread the word to others and will be back.  OH! AND THE SANDWICH WAS SOOOO GOOD!!"}
{"text":"This is a great local secret.  I don't like sub sandwiches so for me to come here and give a great review is a big deal.  There are 150 menu choices and the service is fantastic.  What makes this place stand out is the bread and quality of the meat.  The bread was grilled, not heated in a microwave.  I had the French dip -best au jui sauce ever.  Can't wait to try something different on my next visit."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time and had a great customer service experience with the manager, very friendly and accommodating.  I tried his suggestion of the \"Bee Thrasher,\" and was surprised with how good it was.  Definitely exceeded my expectations.  The menu reminds me of Ike's Sandwiches, very creative and a HUGE selection.  Glad to have this one in my neighborhood.  Keep it up guys."}
{"text":"Just recently tried this place today. Really good food and a friendly staff. Lots of choices to pick from. The Dutch crunch bread made for great leftovers because the bread did not get soggy at all in my fridge. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Went here today and it was very good! The employees are very friendly and knowledgeable. They even offered to let us try our food before we took it to go, to make sure we liked it. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"All I have to say is LOVE IT!! About time a great sandwich place comes into town. I feel the sandwich's are just like a NY Deli. They are great to share with someone or, you have your lunch and dinner all in one meal. Very tasteful meats, fresh Ingredients, and the sandwich makers are all from culinary schools so they know how to make a great flavorful sandwich. Plus, if you can not find something on the menu, have the culinary experts make you up something. Prices are perfect for a great sandwich, if you don't want quality meats and ingredients and want to pay 5.00 for a sandwich stick  with your Subway, but, if you want refreshing, GO here!! Well worth it!"}
{"text":"One of the unique aspects of their sandwiches is that the ingredients, both meat and veggies, are large and chunky. This was both good and bad because the chunks are fresh and flavorful but they fall out of the sandwich, making it very messy. The chicken was shredded white meat chicken and the turkey was oven roasted, both tasting very good. Everything, including the bread, was fresh and made for an overall delicious sandwich. 

Now, for the not so good.  The sandwiches were on the pricey side at $10 for a basic sandwich without chips or a drink. When we were there there was only one employee working during the Friday lunch period, making everything slow down as he was overwhelmed with taking orders and making sandwiches. They ran out of chicken and iced tea.  I overheard one customer, who had ordered, paid and was awaiting her food when she found out they had to substitute her meat say \"that's the last time I come here\" even though the employee was very apologetic. 

It appears that the ambiance is meant to be eclectic but the colors are a flat institutional grey with one black wall. The light fixtures are crystal chandeliers and they had mosaic mirrors on the booths. To reference a previous post about an angry blonde woman's face everywhere, we ran into a handful of small pictures but she looked neither angry nor happy. However, the use of this image feels out of place in a sandwich shop. Add my twisted sense of humor with the drawings, the name \"hook me up\" and some suggestive comments posted on sandwich wrappers (that were hung for display) and it caused us to raise our eyebrows.  Also the bathroom toilet wouldn't stop flushing, so some maintenance is needed."}
{"text":"One of the best French dip sandwiches I had. Upgrade $1 to the prime rib :) The employees there are really nice and takes their time to explain the menus for first timers!"}
{"text":"I ordered through yelp because I'm lazy and was actually really surprised at how fast it came! The food was soo good and the potato salad is BOMB! (NSA not a real bomb) The sandwich was fresh and the guy who delivered it was really sweet  So I defiantly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today.  There are a lot of places to eat in this area where I work, a lot to choose from.
When I walked in at 12:00 there were two people at one table and three at another and three employees.  
The place is simple, nothing that stands out.  I ordered the #52 and although there was hardly anyone in there they three employees had no hustle, seem to have all the time in the world.
Took 15 min to get my sandwich.  The sandwich was fine, nothing to brag about but nothing to criticize  about.
I can go across the street to Firehouse subs, which are always packed and get a hot sandwich in 10 - 15 min and I love their sandwiches.
If this place is going to survive this location, they really need to step it up."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! There is a huge variety in options!! And everyone is so nice! The sandwich is huge and tasty everything is delicious and fresh! We will be returning. :)"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. Two sandwiches took over 30 minutes! The place was full of smoke and to top it off, after waiting that long and paying 23 (yes 23!!!) dollars, got the sandwiches home and one was wrong. Ordered the razzle dazzle, and it doesn't come w mayo or mustard so asked for that sauce which was not on there, and they left off the tomato so it was the driest sandwich ever.  The chicken was dry and there was way too much bread as well.  And finally, if avocado was on it I certainly couldn't find it!  I have been wanting to try this place for a long time and I doubt I'll be back. Hope it gets better or they won't stay for long, even in that great location."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had these sandwiches the other day and we were pleasantly surprised by the size and the quality of the food.  The owner was very nice and wanted you to know that the meats were not that low quality stuff that you get atmost otherplaces.  Let me tell you, you could really tell once you got the food! I ordered the Italian,  there wasa ton of really wonderful meat in it. The sandwiches are HUGE and really good.  We are planning one returning and sharing a sandwich next time because truthfully,  leftover sandwiches are just hit or miss.  The other half  of the meat was used in an anti pasto salad. It's hidden, but we'll worth the trip! Order ahead and really read the menu, there are some great ideas on there!"}
{"text":"We can't believe that it took us so long to find this place.  The choices are many and can be a bit overwhelming but the I owner/manager made suggestions based on my sharing a few likes I gave him.  The sandwich and wrap were very large and very good.  We will definitely be regulars."}
{"text":"I'm in and out of chandler a lot taking care of my grandparents and on one such trip we decided to stop in and see if this place was any good.

 The first thing we notice is that the decor is kind of sparce and it looks like the entire place was thrown together at the last minute. Also there is a creepy ass cartoon everywhere of an angry blonde woman,  but what ever, some of the best places I've eaten have had the worst atmosphere. 

So we go to order and see the menu is massive, which is awful for someone as indecisive as myself, and makes me wonder how can they make ALL of these sandwiches well, let alone remember them all? Regardless, we finally make selections and try to place an order, but I'm not sure if the employees weren't trained or what but they just gave us blank stares before telling us that they don't have everything necessary to make the sandwiches we requested. This we took as a sign and politely excused ourselves and left.

I gave the place the benefit of the doubt and left two stars because we never actually got to try the foot, but the place kind of gave me the creeps so I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in Arizona!! 
So many different options to choose from.
Nice clean restaurant. 
Great customer service the people here are really nice. 
I would recommend this place to people that like to try new things."}
{"text":"Most excellent! Friendly staff guided us to damming nirvana! Bread was incredibly fresh and you could really taste the meats!"}
{"text":"Service is absolutely top notch at this little sandwich spot. The guys are extremely knowledgeable and super friendly. Love how they use natural meats and have vegan and veggies options as well. My son loved that he got a scoop of ice cream after his sandwich. We will be back."}
{"text":"So I decided to try the new sandwich shop in town but it turns out the place is a mess.  My fiance and i got in at 1230 and there was barely anyone there.  We ordered two sandwiches, one chicken and one ham.  We sat waiting for 30, I repeat 30 minutes.  Usually sandwiches are known for being quick!  After the wait we only get one sandwhich.  I go up to the desk and ask for what the deal is and the employee tells me I only ordered one sandwhich with both ham and chicken.  I said I didn't.  His coworker then said no the tickets were on top of each other.  I sit back down for another 5 minutes and they say they are out of ham....  the sandwiches were good but I was in such a rush at that point I couldn't enjoy it.  I doubt I will ever try them again unless I can find two hours to spare for a meal."}
{"text":"CLOSED: Now the location is occupied by Sammie's sandwich shop. I stopped by to get my HookMeUp fix and was shocked to see they are gone. Sammie's said they have some of the same sandwiches but with their personal touch. Still have the fireman's cookies."}
{"text":"This place was pretty awful! Horrible decorations, dirty restaurant, cold and tasteless sandwiches, bland customer service, and dead when we went inside. 
Owner seems very weird and fake when we met her. Her picture is on the side of the napkin holder?? So unprofessional and tacky. 
Overall bad experience. Would NOT recommend"}
{"text":"Sandwiches were great. I'd recommend checking out the menu before you go, as it can be a bit overwhelming. The sassy sauce is amazing. Staff was friendly, prices were a little higher than I expected but the portions were great. This place will be our new go-to instead of subway or anywhere else from now on!"}
{"text":"I made my own sandwich. Turkey avocado with all the veggies and extra avocado! It was delicious. My husband and I also thoroughly enjoyed a chocolate chip cookie! We'll definitely be back! :) Great, friendly and helpful service as well."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times, each time hoping it would be better than the last. The first time my wife and I went there, they were out of roast beef. Only 1 other person in the place, but somehow it took 30 minutes to get our order. I swore I'd never come back, but when the food got here, it changed my mind. Both sandwhiches were delicious. Trips 2 and 3 we were the only ones in the place, but it still took 20 minutes to get our food. Again, we were compelled to go back because the food was great (they were out of ham one day and turkey another), and 20-30 minutes to wait was tolerable since there are rarely any customers there. Today's experience convinced us we're done with them. 4 other people were seated with no food when we got there. We knew that was a bad sign considering their efficiency, but we placed our order anyway. As usual, they were out of ham and turkey. The manager was supposedly out getting the meats. The employees didn't tell us they were out of turkey, and just substituted roast beef for the turkey. I had to remind one of them to put gloves on while making food after taking my cash. Needless to say, the food took FOREVER. The bathrooms were out of TP and paper towels. It all made sense when they told me it was their first day. Holy cow! Why would the manager leave them alone?? Oh yeah, to go get the meat that they're always out of. The worst part was the food wasn't good today, which really killed the last remaining endearing quality of this restaurant.

toward the end of our meal, the manager walked in wearing sweatpants and no box of food in hand. I really wanted to ask him some questions like:

1. Why are you guys always out of some type of meat? Don't you know what your inventory is like a week or a day in advance and plan accordingly?
2. Why does it take so long to make sandwhiches?
3. Why can you not get your employees properly trained?

But I didn't ask him because it just wasn't worth my time. 

As a business owner, I can't help but analyze their ability to make money. At maximum output, they make around 1 sandwhich per 10 minutes, or 6 sandwhiches per hour. That's being really generous, but let's go with it. At $9 per sandwhich, they gross $54 per hour. Assuming 50% margin, the gross profit is $27/hr. $20/hr of labor knocks it down to $7 before paying management, utilities, supplies, and rent. That's assuming they're operating non-stop making sandwhiches every minute they're open.

I can't see how such an inefficient business caused in part by such a complex menu can survive in the long term. 

Best of luck to them, but sadly I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Family owned and a wide array of sandwiches. Literally HUNDREDS of sandwiches written up on the wall to chose from and every one I've tried so far has been delicious. 

Fresh cookie-brownies from local firefighters, wide variety of chips, and something I've never seen in AZ-- an RC cola machine!

If you're thinking about ordering....do it now."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service! Best sandwich shop in Ahwatukee.  Rob kicks ass!  They have delicious cookies.  The staff here are amazingly nice and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches with natural ingredients, extensive meat and veggie options. Good deal on the lunch special, friendly and personal service, and walking distance to our hotel. Score! Great place to pick up lunch to go, very convenient to I-10 at exit 160."}
{"text":"Wowowowowow, what a sannie! Hook Me Up, where gourmet and bountiful intersect. My sandwich was beautifully done. The pesto sauce, bacon, pepperoni, roasted turkey and nicely toasted hoggie roll sent my taste buds into overdrive. 

I don't live in Chandler, but if I did I would have this place on speed dial for sure. Sharon, the owner, is delightful. The staff is courteous, and the place is super clean. 

Oh, and one last thing: obey your sweet-tooth. Don't walk outta this place without one of Sharon's signature milkshakes in your hand. It's thick and creamy and made with the real thing (I watched them make it). Your tummy will thank you. If you happen to live near 32nd street & Camelback I'd like to ask you to Hook Me Up & bring me one too.....:0)"}
{"text":"WARNING! THE MENU IS EXTREMELY LONG.
...but I decided.
The Rueban was amazing. Wish the pastrami was warmed up a bit more. They really should take gourmet out of the slogan. But overall experience was good. Cashier dude did \"hookmeup\" with a large drink- WINK WINK- BUT hooking people up is not good for business. Speaking of business, I don't think this place is doing so well. Sad to hear when my sandwich was so good. I will be back to support a local business and of course for an amazing sandwich.

Till then HOOK-US-UP with lower prices!"}
{"text":"My husband and two young boys love the sandwiches at this place, the only problem: too many to choose from! Oh my goodness, the sandwiches are great, they're also very generous portions and the service is superior. Definitely will be regulars here!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! A little over whelming to pick a sandwich but the worker was very helpful to pick 1 of the 50!!! Best sandwich I have ever had! I'm pregnant and the owner brought me a free chocolate shake and it was delicious he said it was for the baby!!! I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing how good this place is under new owners so stopped in for lunch today. I had the #3, which is basically Buffalo chk.  Per their suggestion had it as a wrap, toasted. Super good, good as any in a sit down restaurant. Nice staff, great lunch special. Folks next to me had theirs made as a salad which looked awesome. I will be back with my family!"}
{"text":"Their customer service is just as bomb as their food. I love this place!! I get the tuna every time. I usually like change but the toasted tuna with the the secret sauce is to die for, maybe one day I'll switch it up. We all know where to find the $5 foot longs(gross) but if you are looking for quality food, thats unlike any other sub place they've been- then come here!!  All the ingredients are top notch. I'm from the PNW so I like the simple, laid back ambiance they have created inside. 

The subs are huge, so one of my favorite things about this place is how I can eat half of my sub, and save the rest for when I get hungry again in a few hours and the bread isn't soggy and it's just as amazing as it was a few hours ago. Stop by for the lunch specials for good deals:)"}
{"text":"Great Place!!!!
Huge portions and insanely higher quality than any other place. Customer service is phenomenal as well. Go there!"}
{"text":"A little wait. But worth it! Sandwiches made from scratch. Taste awesome. Fun place and super friendly owners. Just said Hook me up and got free chips. Owner also gave us free sandwiches for our wait. Good business. We'll be back."}
{"text":"They say they close at 8:00. But it's 7:20 and your doors are locked and tables are up. Never got to try you guys and now never will."}
{"text":"I have never tasted such fresh, delicious food......and the hundreds of combinations and selections are amazing.  I just love their vegetarian/vegan food selection....it is truely the very best I have had the pleasure to taste.

{"text":"The manager was very welcoming and greeted us soon as we walked in. He showed us the menu (150 choices) and gave us great pointers. 

The wait was a little long but the manager brought everyone that was waiting for their food FREE macaroni salad which was delicious as well! This place is great and I would recommend it to anyone who asked me!"}
{"text":"This is the a 3 and half place.

Went to there last week to grab a sandwich before hitting on a long drive to LA. The owner was so friendly and gave me a tomato soup which he said they were doing taste testing.

The great thing is they have over 200 sandwich for you to choose. (It could be tough for a lot people, like me, to make decision.) There are diversity options for meat lovers and veggies. It might look a little pricy comparing to other sandwich places, but both the quality and the amount of meat you would get will worth. 

Will come back in the future to try the rest 200 on their menu."}
{"text":"Great quality meats and bread, with very friendly service!  This is a great local sandwich shop that you should try today.  I've been there a few times now when I'm in the area, and especially enjoy the crunchy roll for my sandwich.  

However, I do have one complaint that stopped me from leaving 5 stars, and that is the drink selection.  The iced tea is that concentrated crap.  Step it up guys, with some brewed tea, like China Mist or similar!"}
{"text":"I am an avid Quizno's goer. So you can imagine my heartache once I moved to this area and found that the closest Q to me is actually a HookMeUp. The interior definitely looked like a Quizno's, but had its differences too. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the huge menu on the wall written in chalk. I read through all of the sandwiches (meat lovers and vegan/veggie lovers) and found each description to be mouth watering, unique combinations. My go-to sandwich at Q was the Baja Chicken, so their number 96. Bee Thrasher sounded pretty good. It had chicken, honey, BBQ, honey mustard, bacon, jalapeños and Swiss. A nice older lady checked me out and gave me free chips since I'm a new customer, or to make up for their expensive pricing ($12 for a 9\" sub), but hey, I appreciate free stuff. 

The sandwich itself could have been better. But that's just my personal opinion since I'm not a big fan of shredded chicken. The texture throws me off and too much of it is too bland for my taste. But for how generous they were with their servings and flavors, I feel that it compensated for that shredded chicken texture.  


All in all, this place isn't my beloved Quizno's, but has definitely made its mark. The shop had friendly workers who were attentive and helpful, the food was flavorful with generous servings and the variety of sandwiches they offer are something to look forward to for future visits. 

The only reason why I took one star away is because of the price and the shredded chicken. Not a fan of either."}
{"text":"We just ate here for the first time today. The sandwiches are so super yummy. The ingredients are top quality and so fresh. The amazing Flavors coming from the in house roasted chicken breast and silly sauce are just so yummy. I had a number 5. I will come back to taste the rest of the menu. Great lunch specials too!"}
{"text":"This place is provides very high quality sandwiches.  They are very tasty and are some of the best I've tasted.  The reason for the two stars is the price and now the service.  You will pay upwards of $12 for a 7 inch sandwich. They need to find a way to lower their prices or they will not stay in business.  As for the service, they are always out of something.  Every time I have to go in there they have to make sure they have what I asked for.  The place is a joke. Also, I went there at 1130 AM the other day and they were closed.  Not good. All in all you get a quality sandwich but it will cost you."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Hook Me Up. High quality meat, big sandwiches, and great taste. Thank you for walking me through the sandwich options and providing exceptional customer service!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches (all natural and locally sourced, by the way) and the peanut butter milkshake is awesome. Definitely come eat here instead of getting some bs subway."}
{"text":"Sandwich was HUGE and delicious. Loved the Silly sauce, all of the ingredients were fresh and tasty. Service was great. I will be back and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We had an excellent experience today. The service was fast and the two gentlemen working were very friendly and super helpful. I love that they have a huge vegetarian menu, I got the meatless meatball! My husband got the Italian and it was full of meat and made perfect although he asked for several extras. I will be back!"}
{"text":"In Phoenix for business and found this place on Yelp thankfully. I had the toasted Italian and it was maybe one of the best subs I have ever had. The staff was really helpful and friendly. They seemed generally appreciative for the business. If you haven't been here before, give it a try, and if they ask, the answer is yes you want the super silly sauce..."}
{"text":"The Scotsman sandwich was  good but it was overpriced ($9.98) and the service was very slow. We were disappointed that pesto was not included with the sandwich although it was listed as an ingredient on the menu. When we pointed this out, we were told they didn't have pesto. The sign on the door also said they had wraps which they didn't. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great food. Huge selection of sandwiches. Too many choices, possibly. A little over priced. 
The major negative for me is that both times I've been there it's taken absolutely forever. From ordering to delivery of sandwich... takes too long."}
{"text":"Ordered THE Reuben #20. Sandwhich was delicious and filling.. Didn't seem so big but when I was finished I was stuffed. I like the feel of the place, friendly people. They have a TON of sand which options, the guy behind the counter showed me their \"best sellers\" menu and that helped me. A little bit pricey for lunch but you do pay for quality. Also very efficient as I had my sandwich fresh made and hot within about 5 minutes. My meal was $11.8? For the reuben, I used the Yelp! Check-in special so got a free drink and chips, not sure what those would have cost. Either way, good place and will definitely be back. Nice to see a non-chain type place."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was amazing!! I had the \"I dream of
Amber\" sandwich, best sandwich ever! Can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"I did not run into the other issues the first reviewer had, however I know this place is new so maybe they were still getting some new folks trained.  I think they have the kinks worked out now however.  I also met the owners on my first visit, and they are nice folks.  They took a few minutes to discuss their menu and their ingredients, which I think shows they are the real deal, and they take a personal interest in the quality of their product.  I am tired of the large chains for the most part, so it is nice to have another option when I need to make a lunch run.

The name \"Hookmeup\" is weird (I have a hard time remembering it), and the menu is a bit  daunting (there are many sandwiches to choose from).  But I can get past those if the food is good, and it is.  

So far I have tired the ruben and the french dip which were both very good.  The french dip was one of the best I've had in a while, lean and the french roll was just right.  The ruben was a double deck sandwich which is not what I am used to with rubens, but it was also lean and tender (not overcooked or too thick), another one I will be getting again.  I also tried their bison chili which was good with some spiciness to it.  Finally, I tried their corn chowder which had a good flavor, but was not a thick soup like I prefer - I'd still probably get that again.  

I also really like the jalapeno chips they sell, they are Metro Deli brand Jalapeno Cheddar kettle cooked chips.  I'm gonna have to find them in a bigger bag in the store.

I am gonna make this part of my weekly lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Great service, great food. The best quality meat I've ever had, will be a frequent customer here"}
{"text":"Best Sandwiches in town! Great service! High quality ingredients and overall excellent experience. Will for sure come back."}
{"text":"This place in Ahwatukee is fantastic.  The sandwiches are huge, you can go there for dinner take home, they have over 150 combos.  Or customize it.  The bread is so good, do not waste your time at Subways crap, go here, for a buck or two extra you won't regret it."}
{"text":"OMG, sooo good. Sitting here finishing the Bee Thrasher (#96) right now. The menu is huge with 150 sadwiches. The owner is very enthusiastic about his menu. Natural meats, fresh veggies, and fresh breads. $7.99 lunch special that includes sandwich, chips or potato salad, and drink. Any sandwich can be turned into a wrap or salad. I'll definitely be returning"}
{"text":"Oh boy where do I start! I took my daughter and her friend and at first we were overwhelmed with the hundreds of sandwich options but they were so great working with us. We told them what we like on our sandwiches and they \"fancied\" it up for us. Delicious! I had the Reuban and it was superb. Hands down our new favorite sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Great service, silly sauce is amazing!!!! Lots of great all natural meat sandwiches to choose from."}
{"text":"Food and staff are awesome. Found this place after driving around so stopped in to give it a try. Staff was eager to give suggestions and helped us to customize to our taste. Only 4 stars because the sandwiches are pricey but nice and big so it's justified, and there's no clear menu board. We just found out there was macaroni salad option for a side by reading the reviews, would have liked to try that. I work just down the street and would be more likely to stop in for lunch if they offered a half sandwich option, a smaller serving at a smaller price would be perfect."}
{"text":"In the mood for both something new and a sandwich, I gave this place a try. I intended on ordering ahead for takeout, but the menu was so overwhelmingly large and interesting that I decided to eat in for lunch in hopes that just seeing the real menu would help me decide. Everyone behind the counter was super friendly and helpful, one of them even helped me sort out my preferences from the 90+(!!!) choices on the menu. They explain that their meats are all natural, fresh veggies, delicious fresh bread. I chose the Toy Woody with everything on it but mayo and mustard. It had delicious shredded chicken, bacon, teriyaki sauce, banana and jalapeño peppers, lettuce, tomato, onions, cucumbers, and something called silly sauce, which is a unique pesto flavored creation. All of it on fresh French roll. Omg delicious. My service was incredibly attentive and I can't wait to try many other sandwiches on the menu.  

Oh, and btw, I got the \"lunch sized portion\". It was huge, got a small side (I chose potato salad), and a bottled water for $9.74. I expected to spend that much at least so I feel like I definitely got my $$ worth for the quality of food and service."}
{"text":"Really like this sandwich shop! The selection and amount of options are huge!  They are a small mom and pop and everything is made fresh so you will need to wait a little, but it's worth it! Over 150 pre-made options and you can customize any of them. We have been here only twice, but we plan to keep coming back. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"What a great sandwich shop!  There are so many amazing options...both with meat or without.  And the service is amazing.  The guys who work the front counter make you feel like you're visiting a friend's home.  They are super interactive, enthusiastic, and friendly and they treat each customer the same way, even when they are incredibly busy and the line is out the door.  And despite the lunch crowd, the sandwiches were still delivered in a reasonable amount of time.  Nice job guys!

I ordered the Scotsman, which was pretty good.  All veggies were super fresh as was the bread.  Oh, and when they ask if you want your bread toasted, your answer should always be yes.  I only have a couple of complaints, which is why one star is missing.  First off, my sandwich was supposed to come with pesto, which it did because I could see it.  Unfortunately, I really couldn't taste it.  And I found that pretty strange because pesto has such a strong distinct flavor.  The other thing was that the sandwich was SO messy.  It literally fell apart and was more like a salad with a side of bread.  Overall though, I'd definitely recommend stopping in and I hope to return to try some of their other delicious sounding menu items."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I went here a few weeks ago. I ordered the goodness sandwich (turkey, avocado, & cheese) & he got ain't that a kick in the bread. I will only be reviewing my experience & sandwich, but I will say he enjoyed his. The board with the sandwiches was a little overwhelming & did not list everything on the sandwich which was a bummer. 

The quality of ingredients was really good! 
I liked the bread, the turkey was good, & the avocado was fresh. The sandwich was pilled high, I know this is odd to say, but it could have been less full. 

For 2 sandwiches, a bag of chips, potato salad, & two drinks it was over $30. I thought that was a little ridiculous. I could have had a meal at a restaurant for two people for less. Also they hyped up the potato salad, it was not that great. Also it took about 15 minutes to get our order when we were the only ones in the place.

While the quality is great, I actually wish they would put less in the sandwich & bring the combo price to closer to $10. That would be more competitive with Jersey Mike's & I would be more likely to return whenever I want a sandwich."}
{"text":"Searched French dip on Yelp and filtered by highest rated and Hook me up was at the top of the list, and around the corner from my work. Guy at counter was extremely welcoming and attentive when taking my order, and didn't have to wait very long. One bite in and I was already hooked. French dip is one of my favorites and this is HANDS DOWN the best one I've had. (Even over the one at Houston's for nearly double the price.) Goes without saying this place will be my new lunch go to for sure! Can't wait to try the other extensive menu items....(if I can ever get passed the French dip that is)"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've gone here and they've yet to disappoint! I ordered the Goddess Sandwich with the sauce and it was phenomenal! They owners are so friendly and helpful (there's over 150 sandwiches to choose from). I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches.  Goddess is huge and tastes great.  3 little pigs I'd like more bacon, but that it's just me being me :-)"}
{"text":"Expensive! No prices on their website or in the restaurant.  $10 per sandwich easy. 

I read the previous reviews and thought I'd check it out.  Not good. Edible. Potato salad tastes like they bought it from the grocery store deli. Order was wrong even after I clarified when I picked up and had to wait for my to go order.  There was one person in the place.

Won't be back, it's not gourmet, bad Quiznos at best."}
{"text":"Everyone here is always really nice and the food is delicious. It WILL take a long time but it's worth it for the better quality ingredients they're using. 

I don't like eating here because of the layout/height of the tables but I get take out a lot of the time. 

You're looking at about 11 dollars for a sandwich. It's high but it's the only place I've been that NEVER has creepy meat or wilted looking veggies"}
{"text":"They just opened & I'm so happy! A ton of options to choose from! Seriously one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Big enough to split between 2 meals. I had the green pig (BLT with avocado). Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Pastrami Sandwich was great.   The sandwich was so big it could be a meal for two.  I ate half of it for dinner.   The flavor really represented an upper echelon type sandwich.   If you want a new eating experience I'd give it a shot."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time today. The owner was getting ready to close early - business had been slow. She stayed open to help my friend and I, chatted with us and gave us each a bag of chips. Best. Sandwiches. Ever. Such a cool place!  Will certainly come back!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Awesome Turkey Sandwich (Goddess).  This was my first time here and had some trouble with the menu because of the bizarre sandwich names, but after a few minutes settled on the Goddess Turkey Sandwich combo which comes with a drink plus side item,.. Cole slaw, macaroni salad or chips.  Total damage was $15.14.   A bit pricey for lunch, but was not disappointed when the Goddess arrived.  

The ingredients were fresh, the chunks of avocado were magnificent, the guy on Turkey slicer was not weak on delivery and provided a truly remarkable sandwich on bread that was soft and delicious. I did not order the \"crazy sauce\" but was provided a sample on the side.  This pesto based sauce was not overpowering, too bitter or too tart, but just the right amount of flavor to kick this sandwich up a notch.  I ended up putting a generous portion on my sandwich.  

If you are looking for a five dollar footlong, keep stepping...you get what you pay for. But if you want a great sandwich for a man size appetite, this is the ticket.  Will definitely come back to try the others.  

Staff was friendly and the restrooms and floors were immaculate.  5 stars all around!!!  Thx"}
{"text":"Big Italian sandwich was awesome. Only recommendation is to have a sandwich of the day and a couple featured sandwiches to help people who have trouble choosing from the epically long list of 150 sandwiches."}
{"text":"Awesome place, I happened to stumble upon this place while out shopping and taking a look on Yelp. Met the owners of the shop, they are true believers in what they do and the quality of their product.... and I am too! Good luck in your future endeavors, if you open a shop in N.Scottsdale I'll be your first customer!"}
{"text":"This is not your usual sandwich shop!! This place has over 150 sandwiches which can be customized to your taste. I had the Tonys big Italian brother. It was an Italian sandwich with pineapple. Crazy good!! The saltiness and sweetness with the savory secret sauce worked very well together. I forgot to mention that this sandwich is not 2 slices of meat on a giant roll. This sandwich rivals the size of the pastrami sandwiches at Chompie's. I ate half and wondered for about a half second if I should eat the other half. I realized I wouldn't want to deprive my tastebuds of the deliciousness I have come to fall head over heels for. It's going to be hard to try any other sandwich knowing how good mine was, but there are so many unique combinations that I need to explore the menu more. This place is really all that and a bag of chips."}
{"text":"Hook.Me.Up!!!!! I couldn't have said it better myself!!! These are beautiful sandwiches... There is no other way to describe them.... Besides delicious, fresh, hearty and yummmmmiiieee!!!
The staff was knowledgable, friendly and patient. They have an amazing menu with some pretty innovative combinations!! I highly recommend this establishment.... Follow my advice so you can get hooked!"}
{"text":"Wow!! This place is awesome! I don't generally like to spend money on sandwiches, but it's worth every penny at this place. I'm from Prescott and rarely drive out that way, but the drive would be worth it! Awesome food folks!"}
{"text":"Nice people and huge menu. But don't let the name fool you . This is a sub shop. It was OK and if you are vegan there are lots of choices . But if you are not a vegan , this place is not all that special . The real killer is they serve the subs on white bread! No wheat, grain breads --all white ( or wraps). Kills it for me. Even at Subway I can get wheat bread"}
{"text":"Super expensive....but good. Place is new...so a little disorganized. They have like 40 different kinds sandwhiches."}
{"text":"The customer service here is phenomenal!! My mom and I were both so impressed. The food was delicious. My mom and I both had the \"Ain't that a kick in the bread\" sandwich and both loved it! Plenty of chicken and packed with veggies. The macaroni salad and potato salad were delish as well!! They did have someone new working which made things a little slower but their customer service was so good it wasn't even an issue in my eyes."}
{"text":"I'd read so many good comments about this sandwich shop in our local FB group and was glad to have the chance to stop by to try after a doc visit this morning.

It's hard to choose from the gazillion sandwiches they offer -- they had a boardful of just the faves on the wall, LOTS of 'em. Apparently, I must've hit THE fave, because just while we were there, many others came or called in asking for #51. It was a good choice. Delish!! Fresh sourdough bread, generous serving, and really fresh-tasting ingredients. Really good combo of flavors, too.

Owners and staff, all friendly and helpful. We wish them much success. 

Convenient location, too, so close to the I-10, at 48th St, just north of Chandler.

Had to edit my post to add that I was very impressed by the cleanliness. I really, really appreciate eating in a place that everything you see and touch is all clean... yes, even the restroom."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this location, I had been to the one on Chandler. The staff was very welcoming and gave great suggestions on what to order. The Rueben was delicious. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. Generous portions. Clean. Great customer service.

I took a sandwich home from here tonight. I had a chicken sandwich with marinara and cheese. I was expecting slices of grilled chicken breast, but it turned out to be shredded chicken. I didn't get to eat it until about an hour and a half or so after they handed it to me, but it was still totally delicious. I pretty much expected the bread to be a soggy marinara mess, but it wasn't at all. The bread they use is awesome. I had the soft french bread. Overall, the sandwich was REALLY good - especially considering how long it sat in the bag before I devoured it.

The owner and staff were super nice and friendly. The place was very clean as well. It's set up sort of like a Quiznos, but it's clear the quality of ingredients used here is far superior. They will pretty much make you any sort of sandwich you can dream up. Their menu online has 150 sandwiches on it plus a build your own. 

Looks like this restaurant is going to be a new local chain - I'm told they plan to open more locations. There are a few other choices for sandwiches at this intersection, but having tried the other places, I can safely declare this the best option. 

While I was waiting for my food, a guy came in and said he's been to sandwich places all over the East coast (and listed some States known for solid sandwich shops) and that this was the best sandwich he's ever had. I mean, if I was a real professional culinary critic, I would have been suspicious that they paid him to come in and say all that stuff. But I'm not and it was legit. I don't know if it was the best I've ever had, but it was definitely good enough to make me want to go back. 

Oh, and they deliver if you live or work nearby, so that's awesome."}
{"text":"Came in today for the first time and was very satisfied. The staff was very welcoming and very helpful, I will definitely be coming back C:"}
{"text":"The place was empty which should have been a clue but we ordered anyways.  The food was subpar, no flavor in either sandwich. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Like I mentioned in a previous review (see Arizona Sandwich Company), the sandwich that I compare to all other sandwich joints is their version of a grinder or Italian sub.  Italian meat, provolone, lettuce, tomato, onion, pepperoncini, Italian dressing, pickles.  

The staff here was great and super friendly.  I ordered the Italian.  Though I appreciate their use of very fresh ingredients, this Italian sub also fell short of my expectations.

The size of the sandwich, in comparison to the price, is average.  You can find better value in the Valley pretty easily.  The sandwich was a little light on the meat, though the balance between the three was pretty good.  I like their pickles.  Their bread is average.  All put together, I just can't say I was wowed by this sandwich.  I've had so many good grinders and heroes back East that to give this place 4 stars would be an injustice to those places from back East.  

This is not a bad sandwich at all.  I like the freshness.  But it not an excellent sandwich either.  I may be back here to try a different sandwich to see if they have a specialty sandwich that knocks my socks off."}
{"text":"What a great sandwich shop. An amazing menu & outstanding customer service. One if the best sandwiches we've ever had. Tucked away in a large strip center, but definitely worth finding. Do not miss this one."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. Had the French Dip Sub. It's very hard to find a French dip sub in AZ. One of my childhood favorite subs. When I saw this on the menu I had to try it. This sub was great and the dipping sauce amazing. The only problem is the sub was $10.00. Little steep and didn't include a drink or chips. I'm not sure I would rush to this location for a $10.00 sub but it was worth trying it and to know when I get a craving for it I can count on getting the sub from this location."}
{"text":"We ate here for lunch today with a group of 7 people. The staff was so friendly and attentive and FAST! This is our favorite place to eat in Phoenix when we come up to visit. We ordered a variety of sandwiches (some to go, some we eat there, because that's how good they are). The ingredients were fresh and every sandwich we got was delicious. The atmosphere is great, though we do miss those silly chalkboard walls. Keep up the great work, you all are the BEST!"}
{"text":"The best sandwich shop around. They have over 100 kinds of sandwiches they can make you. Very friendly staff. Cleanly place."}
{"text":"THE best sandwich is the Valley!! Customer service STELLAR!! I had #60 it was an Italian style and I made it into a spinach wrap! The best Flavors!! It was real meat with nothing artificial! Love it! Worth the drive from my Tempe home!! The owner was awesome and gladly chatted and wasn't bothered by my questions! Even made me a to go bag for my leftover wrap! That's how to do business!!"}
{"text":"I will start by saying this place is a great concept and I love all the sandwich creations they have and I was so excited when I found out about this place. Unfortunately the great concept is very poorly executed. First time I was there they were very disorganized forgot multiple things on each sandwich didn't know how to use the cash register or ring things in had no cups stuff like that. Staff was very stressed out and kept telling me this wasn't normal and they were short staffed but the place was practically empty. The 3 stars are were because my sandwich was very very good and big which is what makes this place so disappointing because it has so much potential the other thing is the prices are insane!!!! I would probably go there more often to be honest because even though very disorganized they are the sandwich is amazing but $13 for a sandwich is ridiculous at a deli! And yes it is a big sandwich but it's not $13 worth.. I'm all about spending money on food I eat out all the time but I really appreciate value as well and this place definitely doesn't have it. Even if there sandwiches were $8 I would go there all the time it's just something about paying $13 for a sandwich (before any drink or sides) seems like I'm getting ripped off no matter how good it is. This place isn't going to last long the way they're going but I hope they improve"}
{"text":"Love getting this place after working out right next door at La fitness. The #16 and #22 are both excellent. If you're a pesto fan add the secret silly sauce. On the more expensive side for a sub shop but the quality of food is better. Definitely recommend this place, give it a try. Unfortunately the customer service is unpredictable. One day everything will be perfect, the next they will have run out of bread, take 20 minutes to make the sandwich, or miss the phone when you call to place an order"}
{"text":"Great food and service! We will definitely return. We had the razzle dazzle and rock and roll cheese steak. Delish!"}
{"text":"Wife and I just had the #70 and #73 with all the veggies delivered, one of the best sandwiches we can remember having. The quality is good and you get a lot! 

If you can't finish the second half like us, separate the bread when you refrigerate it so it doesn't get too soggy the next day. 

Had it delivered twice and was faster then what they estimated."}
{"text":"Anthony at Hook Me Up Gourmet Sandwiches' is a wonderful asset.  This dude didn't freak out on us, give us attitude or compromise his customer service at all during our visit.

This place is easy enough to find when you are from out of town.  It's located in a cute little strip mall and well identified from the outside.

I have mixed feelings about the inside.  When you walk in you will immediately notice about 100 sandwich options to your right on a brightly colored chalkboard.  The rest of the room is pretty bright - with red accents and at first glance it looks quite cute.  After standing around for awhile waiting for Anthony to get to us I noticed that the TV in the back behind the counter wasn't on, the chip rack only had about 10 bags of boring chips and the juice section had 5 juice bottles.  It looked like the place was going out of business.  One pretty cool thing is that they have a chalkboard on the side near the back so patrons can draw all over it and let loose with creativity. 

Apparently Anthony's deliver driver as well as other co-worker who helps behind the counter had called in sick that day so he was by himself.  When we walked in he was busy with another order but he was very polite asking us to give him just one more minute.  

While we waited I noticed that none of the sandwiches had any prices on them.   They also didn't have prices on chips or drinks.  This was really annoying.  Anthony said that they tell you the prices when you order.  Just so you know if it's your first time going the prices range from $9.00 to $13.00 for the sandwich itself.  I balked at this price and he went into a polite but lengthy explanation about how the meats they use don't have hormones etc., etc., etc.,...........................I really don't care.  Put prices on your sandwich menu or put something on your website/store front that shows how fancy shmancy your meats are.

Anyhow, he ended up giving us a friendly discount for the lengthy wait as well as the annoyance over prices.  The sandwiches were AWESOME and HUGE.

I probably wouldn't go again because of the cost but I think that Anthony needs to move to a better sub shop that doesn't leave him hanging by being the only one working.  He would do well in a busy deli.

Chalkboard for kids, Anthony and Sandwich flavor are the only great things about this place.  Since each great thing was so cool I'll give it three stars.  One star for each cool thing."}
{"text":"This place is suuuuper good. It totally surpasses Subway, and you get good portions for your money. This store manager Rob was courteous and made me feel welcome. This is my new neighborhood sub shop!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Staff is super friendly and the food is handmade and delish. Went here for a quick lunch, lots of options to choose from and while you pay more than someplace like Subway, you get what you pay for: stacked, awesome sandwiches with tons of flavor. At least, the two we tried. The Reuben and the Bruski. The Bruski had their secret sauce on it - which was killer. Vegan options too! Will definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"Having just moved to the Phoenix metro area, I was looking for a new go-to spot that was near my new home.  I wanted something that was quick, delicious, and satisfying.  I've found all that here with Hookmeup.

The extensive menu is a bit daunting and overwhelming at first glance, but I've tried a new sandwich during each visit and have enjoyed everything thus far.  The staff here is also very friendly.  Good customer service definitely goes a long way.  The only downside is it can get a bit pricey, but you definitely receive a decent sized sub.  I'm a pretty big eater and even I was stuffed after my meal.

I recommend this place if you're in the neighborhood or just looking for a quality sub shop.  Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Gourmet fast food sums up this place. High end ingredients at an affordable price. Since they make all sandwiches fresh, it does take a few extra minutes than Subway. But seriously it's worth the wait.  The adage of, \"pick any 2; fast, price, quality\". You can have any two but never three. This place has got the price and the quality. Nothing even close to their awesomeness in Ahwatukee!"}
{"text":"This place is a real find!  

When you see \"gourmet sandwiches,\" you generally wind up with overpriced subs that don't merit the added cost.  Not here.  \"Gourmet Sandwiches\" is actually a perfect description of the place, and it's worth the trip to try one. I live in the NW valley, so it's damn near a day trip for me to get there, but I can guarantee that if I wind up anywhere within a 15-mile radius of this place and hungry, it's on the short list.  

So, for my experience:  I walked in and was immediately greeted by a knowledgeable, helpful employee who gave me a brief overview of the menu, the philosophy of the place, and the options.  The menu is rather large and there were literally dozens of things that caught my eye.  Since I couldn't decide between the two I finally narrowed down to, I called my wife and asked if she wanted me to bring her some lunch, just so I could have an excuse to try both items.  Both were fantastic, by the way.  

The lunch special came with chips and a drink, and it was completely reasonably priced at around $8. I had them prepared as salads instead of on bread.

The vegetables were fresh and crisp, the lettuce (romaine) was perfect, and what they call \"silly sauce\" is delicious.  They use shredded chicken, which is unusual, but it turns out to be perfect when you eat it as a salad.  

The place itself looks a little new, so I don't know if it's fair to comment on the decor feeling a little \"unfinished.\"  I also realize it's a sandwich shop, but the atmosphere (tables, walls, general feeling) doesn't quite match the awesomeness of the food. I'm not complaining, but I'd like it to feel less like a fast-food place and more of a place I could sit and enjoy the food for a while. 

To sum up, my only real complaint about this place is that it's so damn far away from where I live.  I hope that it's successful and they open a location somewhere on the west side!"}
{"text":"The people that work here are amazing. Service is always great. And the food is so fresh!!!! I hate when people choose subway over this place. It's cheap and way better lunch specials. And the subs are HUGE!! I recommend this place to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"Well i decided to try one more time and, they were closed yet again for some odd repair, again. The \"Supervisor \" was walking out and locking the door stating he was calling the AC guy. Why you need to leave to do that is beyond me. You cant make this up

If i could give no stars i would."}
{"text":"Just ordered here for lunch at work,  so good.   Will totally add this to the grip lunch list! The bread is amazing.  French dip,  to die for."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times because it was convenient after working-out at the gym.  First time I went, it took about 15 minutes to get my sandwich, which is completely ridiculous. There was only one customer ahead of me and the wait time was totally unacceptable. When I finally had a chance to eat it, the flavour was decent, but was lacking something.

A few weeks ago, I decided to go in again and give the place one more shot. Ordered the tuna salad sandwich and was told they were out and needed to make more because it was really popular. I didn't have time to wait,  so ordered another sandwich instead. For the inconvenience, the owner (me guessing) offered to give me a side for free. I said it wasn't necessary, but accepted anyway. When I finally received my order, I realized that the macaroni salad wasn't in the bag and I didn't care enough to bother asking for it. For the price and poor service, I won't be coming back again. Be aware if you have a short lunch break...you'll be late for work."}
