{"text":"Great if you're looking for cheap and pretty good Chinese take out.  For a Chinese food court/take out style shop, Yogi's noodles is pretty good. There's a variety of dishes and the chefs are pretty consistent at grinding out tasty food. Usually a meal (rice/noodle + meat/vegetables/etc) is around $6. If you order the 3+ dish (dish only, no rice) combo, it is around $6.50/dish and they give you a full take out box's worth of free rice. They're pretty generous in terms of portion size too. One thing I have to mention is that sometimes the taste of the dishes changes a bit. Like sometimes their beef has a bit more/less black pepper in it or the sweet and sour pork is very crispy or not that crispy. However, their fried rice is very consistent in flavor. Perhaps their chefs alternate or something?   They offer party trays that are around $40 (small) and $50 (large). Those party trays are gigantic. Sometimes my family orders a small party tray of fried rice and we take it to work/school for lunch for the next 2 days. Serves as a quick fix for when we're busy or too tired to cook.  Bubble tea is highly recommended here. I purposely come to get it. For $2.50 here you can get a mango/honeydew/coconut/taro bubble tea with tapioca and some sweet clear jelly thing. I always get the taro bubble tea and even after trying the taro bubble teas from actual bubble tea shops, I find that the taste doesn't differ much from this one, but this one is sooo much cheaper. Simply put, this is bubble tea is worth it.  I'm a regular at this place so I'll continue coming back. Overall, its a good place if you're looking for cheap Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"Alright, so I've only had one dish here... and that's the General Tao chicken. I'm on a little quest around Mississauga to see which place has the best General Tao - and so far, this is BY FAR the worst General Tao I've ever tasted; even perhaps the worst thing I have EVER tasted.  This is the most spicy, vinegar, 'garbage' relat-able food item I have ever encountered. Absolutely do not get the general tao here. It's a shame I threw it out in the garbage after one bite... didn't even take a picture of it.  But I am sure they do other things (things that are traditional chinese and within their realm of cultural comfort. Example: Sweet & Sour Pork, Been Curd with Beef, etc) fairly well... just don't order anything American-Chinese here because they will make a huge fail attempt."}
{"text":"It's your standard Chinese food court fare.   Likes: They have lots of sizzling pans to give you a sense you are eating fresh and it's cheap.  It was only $5.75 pre-tax.  Dislike: Well, it's food court food and while the fried rice and spicy squid tasted great, it seemed like there was an excessive amount of salt.  I actually craved dessert afterwards and I usually don't like sweets.  I think they may have added additional salt to make you more thirsty and that makes sense to me given that they also sell bubble tea.    Overall, a-OK."}
{"text":"one take-out restaurant amongst a strip of many in a classic, somewhat-grungy mississauga mall.  i got the malaysian fried rice noodle - pork, shrimp, flat rice noodles, chili flakes, sesame seeds, all cooked in a peanut oil i believe.  no distinctive flavour and a little greasy, but decent overall.  however, the portion is absolutely unbeatable for the $6.25 i paid for it (see photo).  this sentiment kinda applies to every other restaurant in the mall"}
{"text":"Great place for cheap Chinese food. It's the typical Chinese fast food restaurant. I usually order the salt and pepper chicken wings or pork chop because they are absolutely delicious ! They lady there gave me a discount when I purchased two dishes or more dishes. It only costed me $13 after tax for 2 dishes and a box of rice ! Definitely reasonable. Portions are more than enough for two people. We had plenty of leftovers.    Bubble teas here are also cheaply priced. Only $2.50 for a large bubble tea with tapioca, ice cream and jelly !!"}
