{"text":"I stumbled upon Cala's Pizzeria thanks to Groupon.  So my fiance and I decided to give it a try, because what did we have to lose, 10 bucks?  The restaurant is small and cozy, and filled with regular diners.  The staff was friendly and attentive, and it was a simple, fun dining experience for a Saturday night.  My fiance isn't the most adventurous eater, so the fact the menu was filled with all the Italian favorites -- pasta, pizzas and sandwiches -- made both of our mouths waters  Leave it to him to try one of Cala's signature dishes, the pizza burger.  Not only was this sandwich absolutely ginormous, but I also thought he was going to have a heart attack right there in the booth.  It was comprised of two large pieces of pizza (the bread) filled with the largest sausage patty I -- or Jimmy Dean -- has ever seen.  I tried a bite and it was fantastic.    The eggplant parmesan sandwich I ordered seemed to pail in comparison to the monstrous pizza burger but it was still delicious.  The eggplant was crispy and delicious and a great complement to the cheesy breadsticks we order.    So if you're ever on the East side looking for a no-frills, inexpensive and delicious Italian meal, stop by Cala's.  But only tackle the pizza burger if you haven't eaten for days or have an army to share it with."}
{"text":"Great food when they get it right. Thats not very often. Delivery is always 45 minutes to an hour. Always ends up being way over an hour, how do they handle it, oh well. Never a sorry we are slow ass liars. Done ordering here. Its to bad, because the owners worked to hard to have it turn this bad. To many other great places to have to put up with this. Good luck folks."}
{"text":"Yum! Everything from here is so good. I love their steak and cheese sub, broccoli cheddar popper things, salads, pizzas, it's all great. Best steak and cheese sub I've been able to find in the area. They've got great huge salads, and their house dressing is amazing. It's a good, tart Italian, with a good amount of oregano. Everyone is super friendly and very accommodating. I've also gotten delivery, and sometimes you do have to be patient, but I expect that when I'm ordering delivery anywhere. All in all a regular place I go, and haven't ever had a bad experience."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood pizza parlor that has been around forever. The last time I was here I enjoyed the pizza so we started getting take out when I lived in the neighborhood for two years. I had a friend that said he worked here in high school so I know this place has been around for at least 25 years. Another friend had told me his sister and brother-in-law purchased the place so family owned and operated is always a plus. The only thing that stood out to me was that there was no faucet in the men's room so I immediately thought how does the staff wash hands after using the toilet. I asked my friend and he said they use the sink by outside the bathroom. That is a risky thought of someone if in a hurry are they going to stop and use. Also are customers aware and comfortable using a sink that looks like it is used by the staff for other purposes. Makes me think there are a lot of potential germs floating around this place but I still stand behind four stars because I won't let my germ phobias kick in and change my mind!"}
{"text":"There are a few things that come together to make Cala's a winner. -Super Fresh Ingredients  -Nice Dining Room  -Super Fast Delivery"}
{"text":"Got pizza here a few times just to see if they were having a bad day and it was not the case here I went in both times only to see and here foul mouth teenagers making pizzas and all three times the pizza had grease floating on top of cheese not very good"}
{"text":"Good food (when they get your order correct)  HORRIBLE customer service.  We have been ordering from them for that past year or so, and almost every time, something had to be wrong with the order.  At first we didn't complain, but after a while, I started getting annoyed that I was paying and TIPPING for missing items, or items made the wrong way.  Last month there was an issue with an eggplant parm SUB that came as a meal over pasta, and when we called in, they wanted the meal back.  Not an issue, but we thought it weird, because I thought that once food passed the counter that they could not take it back.  I could be wrong. So don't beat me up, but I mention it because I thought it was odd.    Two weeks ago we order a sub with no oil and vinegar and one with.  Don't you know the order was reversed and the the one which was to have no O/V had it and the other which was meant to have it didn't.  Called up, got a credit.  Today, A LARGE sub that was ordered came as a SMALL, and absolutely plain.  When we called to complain, their excuse was that the order was read back to us when it was placed and we agreed to what was repeated.  Which we did, because the order was repeated back to us CORRECTLY, but was MADE wrong.  The food isn't bad (again if they get it right)  but not the kind of place I would recommend to people, since I really don't enjoy the headache of waiting on do-overs or paying for something they mess up and refuse to replace.  The attitude of the manager I spoke with today.  Confirmed my decision to not order from them again.  Not worth the time or money."}
{"text":"Always love this pizza....was my Dads favorite. Still a go to place. Love the half sheet, 20 wings, 20-20-20 deal, twenty dollars! Sometime my husband and I on a Friday with no kids order large round sausage, anchovy and it's best snack ever with cold beer! That pizza we get delivered but any other time pickup is way to go!!!"}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend out in Eastlake when she recommended this place. The atmosphere had a traditional pizzeria feel. The dining booths had old jukeboxes where you can pick a song to play throughout the restaurant. However, none of them were working at the time and they eat my quarters up. We ordered a pepperoni and mushroom pizza, it was delicious. It had the old thick crust feel to it, almost like deep dish. The toppings were large as well. Pricing was reasonable, $10 for a large, a little more for extra toppings. Service was great, the waitresses are always checking up on you. The workers multitask here as they cover the dining room and carry outs, but they seem to handle it well. I had a good experience here and from what I hear from the locals, this is one of the best pizza places on Cleveland's eastside."}
{"text":"We order from Cala's around twice a month. We always get a half sheet pizza and Parmesan garlic wings. You can not beat the cost and the food is really good. The cheese is shredded fresh and that makes a world of difference. We often will add on a salad, but always order it there, so it isn't hot from sitting on the pizza box. I love supporting small business and will continue to buy from here."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat at my favorite thing is their calzones. Its clean and friendly. Weekends theyre busy if you want to eat here itll be a wait but i love this place. The last time we waited to eat here it was worth it they sat us when a booth opened up, and we sat we didnt complain, but because we waited for a seat they offered us a free dessert for being patient which i didnt expect we were quite shocked. Theyre food is worth the wait i cant complain at all. I also came here one time with my parents they got a pizza i got my dinner first, and was done eating by the time their pizza came they were busy again our sever gave us a free dessert since the pizza was late, and they apologized more than once they even offered to take it off the bill my parents declined to that when they got the pizza it was cooked properly. I dont have any bad things to say if they ever forgot anything it was minor things like dressing. We continue to go back the food is always good, and the reason people complain about it being greasy is probably theres more than one meat on the pizza which that what happens to meat. Everything is fresh which is nice all the other pizza franchises arent fresh or as good of quality. Id rather deal with the wait if i have to than speedy food quality is better. Calas has been around since i was a kid there arent many places out there like this other than pettis. So people if you want to complain go to pizza hut or marcos and get that garbage enough said no reason to bash this place look how long theyve been open theyre doing something right."}
{"text":"Food was very good only reason giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is ordered a small dinner salad which was 3.99 and they barely give you anything for that kind of money but if you eat in you get plenty and I ordered a side of ranch with my wings which I was charged for but they did not bring"}
{"text":"I have been buying Cala's Pizza for years,  Their Hawaiian Pizza is the BEST !"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza/wings with great customer service. The restaurant is nice and cozy with Jukebox selections at each booth which is unique."}
{"text":"The guys and I get pizza from work here when were on second shift and wana get fat.  Kids working there are always cool and fast.  They actually have a dining area with those cool tableside jukeboxes.  Wish they had one with all 90s hip-hop.  Now that would be dope.  We only ever get pizza and they take our coupons with no problem.  The last time I had from there though it had ZERO flavor and was a tad doughie for us.  Might put it out of rotation for a bit.."}
{"text":"We just tried Cala's for the first time yesterday and it won't be our last. We got the pepperoni melt pizza, which had the perfect filling to crust ratio and the leftovers reheated well today. Tossed salad with Italian dressing prepared in-house. Spaghetti with meat sauce - portion size is appropriate for the money. The sauce is a little sweet for my taste, but I think that's a reflection of personal preference rather than quality of the sauce. Excellent breadsticks. Delivery was prompt, and the driver was personable and courteous."}
{"text":"Ok food. Expensive. Haven't had a very good experience, and I spent so much money, I haven't been willing to try again."}
{"text":"We Just got a Fabulous pepperoni & cheese calzone, cheesey bread, meatball sub & some fries & we shared it all. Dough was super fresh& not too heavy, nice marinara too! General consensus: great value for the money & really good food! Waitress & staff were really nice, very helpful as well!"}
{"text":"Used to go here about 3 years ago and it was pretty good but now has gone downhill; both food-wise and service-wise. The wings aren't as good as they used to be and are over priced for what you get; even the to-go containers have gotten cheaper. I went in with no one else waiting and the 7 kids behind the counter (not exaggerating, 7) were discussing their discount they get on pizza and what kind of pizza they could/should get. This went on for about two minutes, no one acknowldeged me but just walked by talking about their pizza. Finally I had to say something to get my food. I will not be going back. If you want to work there, though, you get free pizza when you work and 50% off when you don't work, so there's that."}
{"text":"Great mom and pop pizza ...but ur really gonna charge for crushed pepper flakes?????  That's bonkers!!!!!!!!!  Mind Blown!"}
{"text":"I grew up a couple blocks from this place and never ever went in there until just the other day. My parents preferred to get Little Caesar's because they hate themselves and their children. We almost never sampled local pizzerias. Sigh, at least it wasn't Domino's. Anyhow, we got the large garden salad for ten bones(it was the size of a beach ball- good value) and a half sheet za for $15. It was also really big. Enough to feed me, the wife, the dog, my ma, and her two dogs. And have leftovers. Loved the pie. Chewy cheese, mild sauce and crunchy crust. The interior decor consists of a lot of pictures of little league teams they sponsored. I fondly remember seeing kids all over the neighborhood wearing their shirts when I was young. Ah, good ol' Willowick. Nostalgia be thy name."}
{"text":"I am giving Cala's 5 stars because their pizza is good. The staff is consistent. Cala's is there for ya - being dependable.   I get their pizza to go, sometimes we eat in. The inside is kinda lame... But sometimes we want super fresh pizza right out if the oven. We also get 6 wings and a salad with house dressing. Dag! I wanna go!   The waitresses are always friendly normal people, most people don't seem to eat in honestly the atmosphere is kinda awkward. But I'm giving it five stars for what it is not 3 stars for everything it is not.   Don't take a date there, don't have a business meeting there, but go there in very casual clothes when you have an evening when you don't want to put forth any effort to impress anyone.   Or get take out pizza."}
