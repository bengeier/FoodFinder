{"text":"this business is not going to stay open long if they dont address their service or lack of service and the quality of their food, my family and i decided to stop here after being on the road all day and was extremely disappointed,from the quality of the meal to how long it took to get it, they werent that busy and it took a good 45 minutes for us to get our dinner. the owner needs to re-evaluate if they want to put some time and effort into addressing his failing business because he clearly either isnt seeing what is going on or just doesnt care. i would hate to see the conditions of the kitchen now that i think about it!!!!  omg"}
{"text":"The family stopped by this place last night. 
They haven't been opened very long and it was evident.
The service was very slow but we were ok with that as noted above it was only opened a short while ago.
There were some problems. The place was hot, uncomfortably hot. 
The smoke from the grill was all through the restuarant. 
They need to put shades on the west side windows to keep the sun out of customers eyes.
The food was ok. Not great but ok.
I think they need to offer more than one barbeque sauce. The one they have is ok, but honestly just average, but I still liked my pulled pork sandwich.
I would back off slightly on the salt on the fries, the fries were good but man were they salty. 
We'll definitely be coming back as I want to try some other things on their menu.
 
Also this place is in North Ridgeville not Westlake."}
{"text":"Don't think we will be back. Went on a Friday night, not too crowded, I now know why. Service was horrible. Waitress was very rude and could never be found. Bus boy was doing more for us than she was. I ordered the nachos with taco meet which wasn't too terrible. However, my fianc√© ordered the pulled pork platter which came out cold. Mac n cheese looked delicious, but the taste was average at best. For the cold food and terrible service I thought our bill was very pricey. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now. I love visiting new local restaurants. This place went through a major remodel and you can't even tell what it was before. I think the decor is pretty nice. Service was good. I usually sit at the bar since I bartend myself. I got the ribs the first time I was there and was blown away! I read some other reviews about the BBQ sauce and rub just being ok. I disagree. I think the rub they use makes these ribs! They do offer two different kinds, and I go with the traditional. It compliments nicely. The sides are excellent and hot as well. Also had a burger one night because they ran out of ribs (granted it was 10, but that would be my only complaint as I was craving those ribs and settled for a burger). The burger was excellent too. Also had their wings which were on special that night. Very good too. I hope this place sticks around!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pretzel burger and my dad ordered half a slab of ribs with a side of fries. They were out of pretzel buns, the ribs were a bit dry and the waitress forget his fries. When he mentioned it to her, she said, \"Oh yeah. You did order fries didn't you?\" In addition, she had the personality of a brick as she just wasn't very friendly. She never came back to fill our drinks either. I heard their steaks are good but this place is underwhelming at best."}
{"text":"Gave it another go. Friday night before Christmas and we couldn't decide on a place so we gave this place one more shot after a pretty poor first showing. Sadly not much has changed. Food is very  below average, for good reason, they can't cook. I went to the bathroom and it goes right past the kitchen. I looked in and watched a \"cook\" squeezing the heck out of a burger on the grill. What amature does that?! My sister in laws chicken was dry, my burger was bland and well done instead of medium, my wife's burger was supposed to be free of mushrooms due to an allergy, which it was not. I'd say if you are 45 and never been out of Ridgeville, this place will knock your socks off. Otherwise it's flat and boring. I want AFU to succeed I really do. Great location and a nice layout just need quality food prepared by someone who knows exactly what they are doing. Good luck."}
{"text":"Really hope this places stays around- that strip mall has seen a lot in and out. GREAT food for very low prices. I had the pulled pork sandwich which was phenomenal. The mac and cheese is awesome too. Great bar, great patio, booth/hightops/tables. DEFINITELY recommend. We came with 9 people and they were pretty busy but the servers will still attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Just went and got their fish taco special and it literally only came with one taco. Probably only a tablespoon of fish was added into the taco but a ton of chips. $9.00
Very disappointed!!!
It wasn't bad but seriously can you really only give one taco? It wouldn't cost much more."}
{"text":"We had to meet someone so they recommended we meet at All Fired Up. I was looking forward to trying it as we had never been there before. We had to bring our kids to the meeting and figured we would order and eat during the meeting. We met there and sat at a table and began talking. After a while it was clear we would not be getting served. Nobody even came to our table to see if we wanted drinks. The karaoke guy came to our table as we concluded at 8:00 to see if we could move so he could set up. Nobody from the business ever attempted to wait on us. Needless to say we will not be going back there!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I have to say I am fairly impressed with the service, food, atmosphere, and price. Not sure I'd consider it a Barbeque restaurant in the tradition sense of barbequing but still decent nonetheless. Good daily specials on drinks and food."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday Night, seated ourselves. It was a bit busy, we sat waiting for 10-15min for service. We finally had to flag down a server and asked for a menu. We decided to leave and take our business else where. It's not a very big place with 3 servers and 2 bus boys there wasn't very much reason for the bad service."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from them to have something different for a change. I got there caesar salad with chicken added. Horrible. Chicken is so chewy yet crunchy just gross to eat. Way over cooked, helped the fack that they barley have you any chicken. And of all things I DIDNT GET CAESAR DRESSING!!! How do you forget that?"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and it's your typical BBQ place. It's clean and brand new. Service was below avg. very slow and had to wait for service. didn't mention any specials but the food was solid. No wow factor about it. I could easily make the pull pork sandwich at home. So I give it a 3 out of 5. Just avg food. Was hoping for the wow factor!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Craft beer on draught is seriously lacking.

Would have been nice if the new waitress had a conscious and not served beer and multiple rounds of shots to the couple with the small child. Hope they made it home okay."}
{"text":"After reading lukewarm reviews, we decided to give All Fired Up a chance. There isn't a hostess, so we kind of lingered by the front door wondering what to do. I might be helpful if there was a \"Seat Yourself\" sign. We ordered wings, and asked for the extra crispy. They came out soft, and the larger ones were not cooked through. I ate one before I realized it wasn't cooked, and sent the rest back. The server took them off our bill. My husband ordered pulled pork and I got ribs. My sweet potato fries and his chips were good. The coleslaw was obviously from a prepared dressing and nothing special. My ribs were ok. The were tender, but the meat was a little dry. His pork was good. The service was slow. I observed another couple come in and look around confused, as we did. They sat themselves, and 2 servers walked past and ignored them. Finally, a third actually acknowledged them and brought menus. When it was time to pay, I gave the credit card to the server. She took the credit card somewhere and then picked up a bus tub off the floor. She put the bus tub ON every table she bussed (about 6). Then she came back to wipe every table she bussed, and THEN she brought my card back. The credit card receipt was from Tommy's, another NR restaurant that recently closed. I thought that was funny, but my husband said maybe it was the same owner. 

All Fired Up is in desperate need of some more staff. The servers had too many tables for them to be running food and bussing. I love local spots, and it would be great if NR had more than one good restaurant!"}
{"text":"It's been five minutes. No one has acknowledged me. Have they seen my Facebook feed? Do they know my feelings about Trump? Did they see me flinch at the TV above the bar? At least it's CNN. I see a server tell another I am here. Surely she will come. I am so hungry. 

Now ten minutes, still no menu. A waitress, not mine, the same one as before, comes over and asks if I'd like a drink. I say a Manhattan and am met with a blank stare. \"On the rocks.\" She comes back with a sketchy, dilute beverage--Jack Daniels, clown sweat and two cherries--and a menu. Finally, food! Sweet sweet cherries!

11 minutes, cherries consumed, no waitress in sight. Hope dashed 

After 15 minutes I announce to no one in particular, I'd like the check! Not-my-server apologizes to me (\"I told her four times!\") She turns around and pivots back. \"I'll just take your order.\"

It's been 18 minutes and my server greets me. \"I'll be right back.\" I don't tell her about my order having been taken. 

Maybe I will get to eat this food but the crap service here is enough for me to write this review. 

Pass it up."}
{"text":"We are newer to the area and thought we would try this place out.  I should have realized when we walked in that no one was at the bar and only 2 tables.  We sat down and waited 5 minutes before receiving service.  We ordered nachos which were served with a combination nacho cheese and shredded cheese, yuck, (if you've seen bar rescue this is a major no no for obvious reasons).  My husband ordered a grilled chicken sandwich which was very dry and rubbery.  It was brought out very quickly so it is unclear how it was prepared.  I ordered ribs which smelled and tasted like lighter fluid, the French fries were grey and not so good.  I have never written a review before so you can imagine this was a very disappointing experience.  Waitress was very nice.  Will not be back.  Food was  unacceptable."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night around 7p. No wait to get a table on the patio which ended up being an oddly shaped picnic table. Service was a bit slow but our server was friendly. Ordered the pulled pork platter and the special... Perch dinner. Pork was tender, bbq sauce was delicious, and was a pretty decent amount served over bread. Ordered with fresh cut fries, which were great, and Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"I'm a huge proponent of supporting local businesses. Last night we decided to give All Fired Up another chance.  Not being a fan of their atmosphere (very much a bar) and having experienced very poor service in the past, we decided to order carry out.   

The lady that typically handles this was on the phone.  Ironically, I overheard her telling whomever she was chatting with that someone was acting as if she doesn't work hard enough, or excel at her job.  She was able to multitask and got herself an iced tea, as I stood there waiting to pay for the food that her co-workers finally brought out.  Irony...you have got to love it!

Got the food home and half the order was wrong.  This place charges way too much for piss poor service and mistakes on simple orders. How do you screw up three burgers and a salad?  

Sorry to be so demanding, but when it comes to people not caring about their customers, I get ALL FIRED UP!"}
{"text":"This place was ok for the suburbs. I ordered the pulled pork platter which came as an open faced sandwich. I had coleslaw and macaroni and cheese as my sides for $10.99. The food was decent but the portion sizes were really really small. Like they actually came in condiment cups. One of the guys at my table ordered a burger medium and it came well well done. Hard as a rock. The food took about 50 minutes to come out so he didn't send it back. The whole time we ate someone was blasting an Adele album. Strange experience."}
{"text":"Bad service! Understaffed, kitchen staff with no hair nets, and cold food.  Ribs and chicken were burned on the bottom. Salad served before meal while our dishes sat on the counter getting cold because the server forgot to get the salad out earlier. You can see the kitchen activity and I watched a cook chew gum or food while preparing meals. Gross-so someone's meal is going to have spit or facial hair in it. They need to rethink their serving safety.  Cold environment due to the patio door opening.  Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I so wanted to give this place another chance. Last time we were there the service was terrible but the food was good. This last time we were there the service was good but the food was terrible. My ribs were dried out and it tasted like I was eating leather. We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Not a bad place. Great wings! They have a nice and crisp skin with good flavor. Ribs, mac&cheese, fries and slaw are all okay. Good choice of beer on tap. We had great service, but they were not very busy. We will go back again."}
{"text":"Average service, awesome fries and wings. The BBQ is subpar- need a more flavorful rub and/or sauce. Ribs were very blah for a place who calls themselves a BBQ place. Would go back."}
{"text":"How do you run out of a specific alcohol when you are located next to a liquor store?!? AND if you run out it's YOUR fault, you should offer a higher quality alcohol for the price they were originally drinking. If you are running low, go get more!!! I hope they go out of business. horrible people here and the bartender is a bitch!!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant. I usually go during the day, and they are never busy. Service is always speedy during the day.  They have great daily specials and the burgers are great.  The all fired up burger is an amazing signature dish. My favorite burger place in the area!"}
{"text":"My family went there knowing nothing before hand. The decor was nice and everything appeared clean. The server was knowledgeable about the menu, which helped my mom choose the ribs. Her ribs were extremely dry, to the point of needing a steak knife to cut. Although the pulled pork sandwich I ordered was pretty good. Although the proportions were a little small for how expensive it was."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is definitely nice.  Great place to drink and live music was on point.  We ordered nachos for our appetizer.  Very disappointing.  Liquid cheese and chunks of tomatoes/onions.  Our meals were just as disappointing.

My advice- drink the beer and eat at Little Hong Kong."}
{"text":"Food was like Normal bar food bartender was nice service was good. I will check it out again."}
