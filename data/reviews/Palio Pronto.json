{"text":"After dinner I decided to walk along the Strip for a while to see some sight and relax.  On my way back to Bellagio from Caesar's, I noticed Palio Pronto out of the corner of my eye.  I didn't have dessert with dinner, so I decided to indulge in some treats before heading back to my room.    I ordered a chocolate dipped waffle cone with Choc. Chip gelato and a Oatmeal Raisin Crumble Cookie.  The cone was good, I don't think it was fresh but it's hard to go wrong with a chocolate dipped cone.  The gelato was creamy and smooth, I wish there would have been more choc. Chip pieces in the mix though, it would have been even better.  The Oatmeal Raisin Crumble Cookie wasn't the best... it was a bit dry for my taste and the raisins slid right off the top of the cookie, bummer!    Those two items with a water were $16.  I know it's LV, but that is steep! Not sure that I would recommend a visit to this snack location.  I don't think I will make the stop again."}
{"text":"THE best Gelato in Vegas. PERIOD. My husband and I tried a few. This is hands down THE BEST!!  Very smooth and creamy. Went on two separate occasions. Tried the lemon first, then coconut. Both absolutely delish!!!"}
{"text":"Das Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas ist - wie der Name verrät - voll auf Italien getrimmt. So auch das Palio, benannt nach dem härtesten Pferderennen der Welt, dem berühmten Palio in Siena, in dem einmal im Jahr auf dem zentralen Platz von Siena die Stadtteile von Siena gegeneinander antreten.    So ist auch das Palio im Bellagio (http://www.qype.com/place/155938-Bellagio-Las-Vegas) ausgestattet. An den Wänden sind die Wappen/Embleme der einzelnen Stadtteile, die Tische tragen entsprechende Intarsien, alle ist hier auf den Palio ausgerichtet.    Das Palio ist eine der wenigen gastronomischen Stätten des Hotels, in dem man schnell und preisgünstig seinen Magen befriedigen kann. Es ist als Café ausgerichtet, liegt direkt neben der großen Poollandschaft. Schon früh am Morgen stark frequentiert (macht bereits um 6 Uhr auf) von Hotelgästen, die sich ihr Frühstück hier zusammenstellen, einige nehmen es direkt im Palio an den ca. 15 Tischen zu sich oder draußen im großen Promenadengang, wo diverse Sitzmöglichkeiten zum Verweilen einladen. Die meisten allerdings nehmen das Gekaufte mit auf die Zimmer, dazu werden Becher etc. auf kunstvolle Papptabletts drappiert, die alles rutschfest halten. Geniale Lösung.    Angeboten wird vom frischen Croissants, über alle möglichen Backwaren hin zu frischem Obst, Joghurts verschiedener Kombination und auch kleine Snacks und Sandwiches. Der Kaffee entspricht der italienischen Kultur, alle heute bekannten Variationen werden angeboten. Doch wer einfach nur einen leichten, amerikanischen regular coffee möchte, bekommt auch den.    Während unseres Aufenthaltes haben wir das Palio zum Frühstückshort erkoren, sind aber immer dort an den Tischen geblieben und haben das Abenteuer der Papptabletts gemieden. Frühstücken auf dem Hotelzimmer finden wir eh öde, hier bekommt man neben dem Frühstück auch das abwechslungsreiche und pralle Leben mit, kann über Leute lästern oder sie bewundern, einen Blick auf den Pool werfen und sich darauf freuen, in Kürze selber dort zu schwimmen und fast das Gefühl haben, sich in Siena verirrt zu haben.    Bezahlt wird bar, mit Kreditkarte oder als Hotelgast am besten mit: room charge. Da hier Selbstbedienung herrscht, entfällt das sonst übliche hohe Trinkgeld, wem's gefällt, legt einen Grünen ($) in die bereit stehende Glasschale.    Fazit: Auch in einem Hotel der gehobenen Klasse kann man den Tag starten, ohne seine Finanzen zu strapazieren. Diese Idee haben viele, man ist in guter Gesellschaft. Qualitätiv und von der Auswahl stimmt alles, vor allem aber ist man weg von dem sonst üblichen, uns so fremden amerikanischen Frühstück. Prima - vier Sterne."}
{"text":"Great place to visit anytime especially before or after visiting the Fountains in front of the Belliago.  They have wonderful baked goods and gelato.  My husband and I ordered Vanilla Eclairs, they were the huge, tender pastry, not too sweet filling and one of the best eclairs I have ever tasted (very fresh). On our next visit I want to stop here again, probably for more eclairs or to try their other goodies. They can pack your items to go, very handy!"}
{"text":"Normajaneth was very helpful she found my phone and protected it best employee ever very polite and people like her are the best we need people like her"}
{"text":"On my way to Qua at Caesars Palace stopped here to grab a bite to eat. They had an bacon and egg brioch that was perfect for my spa day!!  The gelato looked nice too!   I'd definitely stop by again if passing thru or even at the fountains."}
{"text":"Casino/ bar hopping can be fun. And along the way you may want to grab something on your way through them all. This is a great spot to stop into. They have a variety of pastries to choose from. All of which look yummy although I didn't indulge. I did get a drink from this place. They offer vodka mixed with this really good tangerine beverage. It's really really good. On top of that they aren't stingy with the alcohol if you want that extra kick. I will visit this location again when I visit."}
{"text":"This place cashes in on its location in the Ballaggio, right inside the door off the strip (I'm referring to the take out counter with the pastries and gelatos in it). Since the family and I did SO much walking while in Vegas, when we got to this location, hubby was \"starving\" and the colorful mounds of gelato in the display case caught his eye. He purchased a big cone for himself and another for one of our kids.  The price of the gelato cones was astronomical. Granted, the scoops were really generous but still! I forget how much the 2 cones came to, but hubby and I were really taken aback and talked for a while afterwards how expensive this place was, even for Vegas standards (I think the total cost for the 2 cones was a bit over $12).  Also, my kid went to Italy last summer and her verdict of the gelato here was \"it's not legit\". She said it was more like a good ice cream rather than gelato. Since she likes ice cream, she ate it all and loved it, but she said it wasn't a real gelato. My hubby never had real gelato so he couldn't comment on its authenticity, but he loved the cone and devoured it."}
{"text":"Palio Pronto is almost kiosk in size and offers a range of snack items including gelato, sandwiches, coffee, and baked goods. I stopped by one evening for some breakfast pastry for the next morning in my room. I had a global teleconference the next morning, and I wasn't going to do it without a caffeine- and carbohydrate-rich boost.   I only wish I had the coffee that morning to match the tasty quality of this apple strudel-like pastry. It was delicious and it certainly helped me close the deal that morning. And where DO you find a great cup of Joe around here at 5 AM?"}
{"text":"I did not enjoy this place very much. I ordered a ham and cheese brioche because they didn't have anymore bacon and egg ones. I also ordered a quiche Lorraine and my husband ordered a tropical fruit parfait. The brioche was not appetizing as I felt like I was dissecting something.  The ham was chopped into tiny pieces (photos included in this review). I don't recommend this brioche for someone that doesn't like too much texture in their food. The quiche was mediocre. The tropical fruit parfait was tasty but very nutty so if you like alot of nuts in a parfait then I do recommend it.  I probably would not return for food St this place but they do have many small options if you're hungry and on the go."}
{"text":"I just randomly passed this place and wanted to get a croissant.  I got their dulce de leche croissant, it was very stale, served cold and not crispy at all.  Do yourself a favor and walk down to Jean Philippe Patisserie and get your baked goods there!!"}
{"text":"The Palio Pronto.... I have passed this little food place a thousand times. It serves home made gellato,.....    pastries, sandwiches ......    and a variety of expresso. Their chicken Panini is excellent.  It is located at the Las Vegas Blvd. street entrance to the Bellagio. To the right side of the fountains just to the right of the escalators......... I'm sure you have gone by it a thousand times like me ..... It is worth a stop. I only stopped because I thought a little snack while waiting for the next view of the fountains was in order. I was suprised at how good it was. I was suprised at the variety of what was available in such a small area. You will be as well ....."}
{"text":"Descent place to stop by and grab a quick bite. Not an ideal place to relax . Presentation of food, bakery and gelato looks great but I was in hurry and was craving for a dessert and was impressed with the presentation of the Tiramisu and decided to purchase it to go. I was told by the cashier that they had more selection and seating arrangement at another location near the guest tower elevators and pool entrance that have an outdoor patio overlooking the Bellagio swimming pools. So I decided to meet my family at their main location and was satisfied with the service I received and the consistency and flavor of my Tiramisu that I purchased."}
{"text":"I like the desserts here and its a quick place to eat and run. I appreciate a place that is so easily accessible in this property where if you are coming from the strip everything is such a long walk to get to as the resort sits deep on the lot and you have to walk past the whole lake to get to the main lobby/casino areas. Tiramisu and gelato are good choices. I wish they had the Mango Soup that they once had 5-10 years ago at the buffet. To date Mango Soup is my favorite dessert ever. Tart mango puree in a small stemmed liquor glass with three berries inside. Topped with torched meringue - just a memory these days but let me dream about it. Meanwhile every time I enter Bellagio I look for this dessert high and low."}
{"text":"Ordered the tiramisu since I had a craving for something sweet. Steep at $6.50 but cheaper than at restaurants. Tiramisu was absolutely delicious!!!! Pure goodness in every bite. But the shell was no bueno for me. Got sick from it since it was way to rich for me (Was on Paleo before visiting Palio, haha). Would get it again but avoid the chocolate shell."}
{"text":"The fad of the $10.00 cup of watered down coffee and sticky bun has certainly taken off, but dam If I will continue to pay these rediculous prices not to mention deal with the dumbest way to pick up a cup of coffee in history of man.  Small Cafe / Bakery / Coffee place in shops of Bellagio off the main elevators with some tables for a quick coffe. Etc. Unfortunately nothing is quick here.  Nobody sitting but line is into the hallway.   The ordering process is slow  for whatever reason... and a simple Cafe Americana $4.00 and Bun $6.00 well took 10 minutes. Why NO CLUE.   Each order is then given to 1 person to make and serve the coffee at the end. So if 4 people in front of you order double mocha chino cappuchinos with Soy etc.. (just an example)  your simple pour my coffee in a container and hand it to me goes in the back of the line behind all the exotics.  After waiting 10 minutes I finally said I simply ordered a black cup of coffee Sorry sir they are taken in order.   Not to mention 4 people taking orders 1 person filling them NICE!  Coffee itself was scalding hot - but weak like dirty dish water .. Sticky bun was actually good but between the ordering system, filling the orders.. prices and terrible coffee anything more than 1 Star would be a gift..  NOPE... EL PASO!"}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I were walking around the strip and visiting every casino to see what the theme was and felt a bit hungry mid way and decided to grab some food while we were here because it was close by.  I ordered a chicken sandwich and my boyfriend ordered a panini. They both were really dry and even though there was mayo in them they're weren't spread correctly; so a lot of bites were just of bread and chicken. The veggies were old and were beginning to wilt. It didn't taste fresh.  We also ordered a cup of stracciatella gelato. It was good and creamy, but the consistency was a bit thin and was already melting even though it was in the freezer.  For the prices, the food is not worth it. I would wait til dinner next time before I stop somewhere and eat something."}
{"text":"Palio Pronto's 'Stracciatella gelato' is the best in the country!  The shavings of chocolate are everywhere...most other places skimp on them.  The temperature is kept colder than most gelato places (thank goodness...why does everyone else let their's get mushy in the case).  I dream of revisiting this place!  Seriously, I am scouring the country trying gelato and no stracciatella has beaten this one yet."}
