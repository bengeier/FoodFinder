{"text":"After watching the makeover, we had high hopes for our visit today. Five of us arrived and were asked if we had reservations. We did not but sure didn't know why that was important when the entire place was empty.  \"Spaghetti house\" may have been added to the name but I don't know why since there was not much in the way of pasta. Prime rib sandwiches and tilapia which took FOREVER to arrive were very lukewarm. The prime rib dinner was nothing special. I hope the folks who give this place 4 or 5 stars have the chance to eat elsewhere and find some really great food that deserve the high marks because this one does not! What a disappoinment!"}
{"text":"Came here for a wedding reception. This is a beautiful little place with old-fashioned charm. At Christmas time, the decorations are fantastic and made for a festive, cozy atmosphere. The food is good but could use a little more zest. Overall, though, very enjoyable."}
{"text":"ever since they changed the menue and added new drinks this place is DELISH! I am from chicago and was here visiting family. The prime rib and shrimp pasta are to dye for! 
GIVE EM A TRY!"}
{"text":"The food was deliciious.  The decore was exceptional. We were there around Christmas and it was decorated lovely for that.  The decore is totally modern and classey.  We met the owner and she was very very nice.  She even walked our baby around to give us some private time at the table.  They had a very active bar scene in the back with music. It didn't impact the dining room experience negatively at all...I just noticed it when I went to the bathroom which you had to walk through the bar area to get through.  The waiter was very nice as well and really went the extra mile to ensure our service was excellent.  he even brought over treats for the little one."}
{"text":"This may be a wasted review since they're no longer in business but I have to share our experience. We came to Moss' shortly after they were featured on RI. It was a direct shot up Route 57 from Wooster to Elyria. They had already retreated to older dishes and habits.

Chose Crab stuffed mushrooms as an app and they were good. She used blue crab and topped with bacon. There was also bacon on my wedge salad and since bacon is a favorite of mine I was pleased.

Main course was the 12-oz ribeye. It was 2 dollars more than their signature prime rib entree but frankly I was hesitant to order prime rib because the owner was not especially friendly and I feared I would experience her previous recipe.

They offer a side Caesar salad which I found unique and unusual. 

The trip wasn't a waste and we came more for curiosity to see an RI improved restaurant then expecting a WOW dinner.

Shamefully, this business was a waste of Robert Irvine's time and effort."}
{"text":"The owner is selling the building and sadly this place will most likely be closing.

Get there for lunch and you won't be disappointed.

Reasonably priced well prepared food, I just discovered this place ony to find it will be closing soon (sigh). Update - looks like new owner lets them stay. Came back for dinner in February.  Good experience dinner menu much pricier but still a positive experience."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place- even before Restaurant Impossible. Great Fettuccine Alfredo!"}
{"text":"Great place for dinner or enjoying happy hour with friends! The Prime Rib is delicious and the new decor looks fantastic. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the good--food was good. Lunch prices decent. However service was poor. The owner asked and knew we had to be back to work in an hour n 15 mins. With a party of 10 they made us late. She knew that we were in town for training and never once checked on us nor did she have anyone help our waiter. He was nice at first then just got an attitude. It took him 20 minutes to cash all 10 of us out!  That is unacceptable and I bet this \"Restaurant Impossible\" recipient will not be open much longer."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE! After watching the \"Restaurant Impossible\" episode I really expected more.  They seemed to of went back to their original menu just days after the airing.  The Prime rib that I ordered was almost rare even tho I ordered medium.  I had to send it back. There was about 4-5 oz of fat on it, and absolutely no seasoning.  The decor was beautiful on the left side, but unless you take a walk around, you don't get to see it.  Most of the restaurant is the dark and drab bar area in the back. I thought the most amusing part was the girls restroom.  It was decked out in leopard print and even had a leopard print shoe shaped chair to hold the door open."}
{"text":"went there before and after the tv show change over, loved the food, sorry to see it closed"}
