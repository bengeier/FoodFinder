{"text":"We dropped by during Taste of the Danforth and saw their advertisement for the \"Best calamari on the Danforth\". Although I'm not a huge fan of calamari (and seafood in general) my friend wanted to try it, so I tagged along.  The calamari itself was hot and the portion size was decent. The dipping sauce was interesting and had a vinegary taste to it which was different but very tasty in its own way. There wasn't a lot of breading on the calamari which I found nice.  Taste of the Silk Road is actually a Chinese restaurant which is interesting considering it's in the middle of Greek town. Having said that, their menu items looked interesting so we will be back again to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"So we went to the Taste of Danforth and we came across a sign that said \"Best Calamari on the Danforth!\" We were really intrigued and wanted to test out their very bold statement. So we got the calamari and it had sauce with it. It was liquid form and was a bit sweet. It kinda reminded me of fish sauce for some reason without the fishy taste. The calamari was not as breaded as other peoples calamari. So the consistency of what customers were getting wasn't there. On the other hand the calamari was very fresh and barely had a seafood/fishy aroma which most calamari dishes do. It wasn't overly chewy or rubbery hard. Only if the breading/flouring for the calamari had a decent job, I would have possibly given it a 5 star. Until I try it again..."}
{"text":"Kick ass calamari found here! We came here during Taste of the Danforth and was graced by the owner Margaret. Our first time was around 12:00 noon and we fell in love with her calamari at first taste. The calamari was perfect in size, not too small and not too big. it was lightly battered and served with a vinegar-like fish sauce which gave it an punch to the taste buds. Round two: It was so good, we decided to come here after a few drinks later that evening and ordered a second and then a third! They were practically sold out by the time we came and their whole team was there. Fantasticly friendly team and what a family-owned, culinary jewel on the Danforth. Will be back sooner than later to try out the rest of the menu. The best calamari in Toronto!"}
