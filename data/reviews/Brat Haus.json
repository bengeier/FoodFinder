{"text":"I recently checked out this place after a friend had a craving for a hot dog/brat. I was curious to see how this place was, now that it was taking over the space that was previously Oregano's. The area that was once parking is now an awesome wide open patio area. And the fans going in the patio area made it bearable to be out there.   I wanted to guest chef sausage, but sadly, they were out, so I ended up going with the beer brat with relish. It was yummy. There was bit of heat to it, but not too much, just enough to keep it from needing any condiments to help in the taste department. They offered not only the usual, but they had a section for gourmet and exotic meats. Also got a side of fries with their hush hush sauce and their chipotle aioli. Their hush hush is reminiscent of In N Out's sauce which was yummy as was their chipotle sauce. They did offer ketchup and curry ketchup, but I didn't really indulge in that, but the curry ketchup was good with a fry or two. I did appreciate their beer selection. I tried their Lindemans framboise and their one that was apple. I think next time some of the other beers need to be tried but in the boot :P"}
{"text":"I've tried this place for lunch many times.  We usually order the pretzel and beer cheese to start.  The pretzel is soft and tasty, but not huge.  They do also have a massive pretzel for larger groups, but I've yet to try it.  However, the reason to come here is the homemade brats which are spectacular.  My personal favorite is the spicy pepperjack.  Just the right amount of spice served on a hoagie bun with two toppings of your choice.  The fries are also pretty solid.  My only complaint about this place is the high prices.  $9 for a brat and $4 for fries is steep for lunch and throw a drink on top of that and you're nearing $20 with tip."}
{"text":"I was dragged here by my friend, considering the fact that I don't even eat meat, I almost dreaded going but she did say that they had the best shakes so I'm always down for that. So we get there, we have the nicest waiter, Sam, place us inside. The interior is neat. We order shakes and he tells us, there is no ice cream....um ok. So I order lemonade, then he tells us there is no lemonade. UMMM... Ya. I ended up getting a cream soda and a pretzel and the Belgian fries with Sriacha. Delicious!! I will probably come back because I am still curious about these shakes :)"}
{"text":"Great picnic outdoor setting, giant Jenga, sandbags, great beer, homemade pretzels and who doesn't love a giant sausage. Yum"}
{"text":"I've been here 4 or 5 times over several years.   Last time I picked up a to go order.  The bartender acted like I was doing a disservice to have to get it.  The food took double the time they quoted on the phone.   I was missing a side and the food was not nearly as good as years previous.  I would recommend this place 2 years ago but at this point not worth it!"}
{"text":"GREAT beer! Everything else was just ok. It was empty when we were there on a  Saturday afternoon which I thought was strange, so perhaps a bit of atmosphere would have enhanced the experience."}
{"text":"Fun place but have to say the brats were pretty dry and somewhat over cooked. Great sauces and delicious Belgian fries. I was a bit dissapointed in my $10 glass of Reisling as it was barely one quarter of the glass, a very chintzy pour. Service was average."}
{"text":"Personally, I would give this place 3 stars for food, 5 stars for being a fun place to hang out with friends.    First the food.  We got the house brat, a pretzel, some Belgian fries, a vegan burger, a couple of beers, and another pretzel with nutella for dessert. Everything was decent but not life-changing. Prices were a little bit on the high side. There was a decent (but not huge) imported beer selection. One plus was that they have a wide variety of sauces, mustards, and ketchups which are interesting and fun to try with the pretzels and fries. One a side note, this is a vaguely German-inspired pub, not a place for authentic traditional German food.    However, if you are looking for a fun place to hang out with friends, then this place is perfect. They have a huge outdoor patio area with a bunch of games to play (extra-large Jenga, ping-pong, etc.).  Most importantly, we weren't pressured to keep ordering.  My wife and I got our food and one drink each, ate, then spent an hour nursing our beers and playing Jenga and the waitstaff never made us feel uncomfortable about it."}
{"text":"Had the beer and brat taster which paired three delicious brats and beers. The food and beer was excellent, although the service was a little slow. The outdoor patio and ambiance made up for it. Family friendly, it is also a great place for a date. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Just shared the sausage sampler and a schnitzel with my fianc√©e ....  I'd seriously recommend this place. Wine/beer/food all great.   Pic of the $12 dollar schnitzel... well Worth it."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is just yes! The food, the beer, the atmosphere, and friendly service. This is the kind of place we live for. Not to mention, kid friendly for our tot to come along. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to take the time to Thank the Brat Haus for making our wedding rehearsal dinner a remarkable experience. On short notice, one week, they gladly accepted our reservation for 22 people. When we arrived, we were promptly seated and the experience was just amazing. The patio atmosphere is phenomenal for a party such as this.  The menu, while not large, has something for everyone. As a beer snob, I found the beer menu fantastic. The servers were personable and extremely efficient. A great time was had by all and it made our wedding weekend great. Thanks to all at the Brat Haus. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Great place to come for sausage and suds!  They have a really nice outdoor seating area with darts and cornhole.  They grill right where you can watch and smell it.  Rachelle was an outstanding server!!! Very friendly and personable.  Awesome dipping sauces for the Belgium fries and they roast a whole pig weekly!!!"}
{"text":"I was incredibly excited to learn about the opening of this establishment. I'm a fan of Wurstkuche in LA and try to go there when I'm in town (which isn't often, considering my total distaste for that entire city) and was happy to hear that there would be something similar in my neck of the words (albeit in Scottsdale--who sort of wants to be LA but just....isn't).   This place blows Wurstkuche out of the water.  1) The patio, even though it was 105 on a Saturday evening, was extremely comfortable due to the huge mister they've installed. Feel free to sit out on it..you'll be comfortable enough.  2) The service was fantastic the entire night. I was sure that the evening would be a total cluster**** because it was the first Saturday night they would be open. I expected long food and drink waits and general order and ticketing screw ups. None of that happened, even though there were 9 of us on 4 different checks and we were there for three hours. The servers and the food runners were all extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the beer, the food, and what toppings/mustards went well with what. I don't know who Payton has doing his front of the house training (it's probably him, anyway), but kudos to educating your team.  3) The ingredients are fresh and the food is all crafted in house. All sausages are made in house (and they're for sale at the front counter if you want to take them to go). The kraut is handmade. The pickles are handmade. I believe they bake their own bread. The pretzels are handmade. The fries are hand cut. All of the sauces are handmade (the hush hush sauce, a very close variant to Thousand Island dressing, had their chopped homemade pickles in it). Anything they don't make in house is purchased from local vendors/farms.   4) The beer selection rules. Belgian prices, as stated, are a bit overpriced if you ask me. However, they have some great American-made Belgian Style options (finally got around to trying a Green Flash Le Freak and it did NOT disappoint). Don't be an ahole and order a Bud Light--which they don't have. (Although, I did see they have PBR in the can there...guess it's for the hipsters).  5) The food is just really really good. Strong flavors, perfectly seasoned good. Everyone at the table had something different and everyone raved about how good their sausages were. We were also lucky enough to sample a just-crafted recipe that wasn't on the menu yet--a beer cheese fondue served with their house made pretzels. Even though we were all stuffed, we managed to devour it. Dessert was also fantastic; that drunken date cake is a must try.   Rumors abound that there will be other locations--I'm keeping my fingers crossed for a downtown location as it's closer to my house. Until then, I can't imagine we won't be making regular treks to this new place. Congrats, Payton."}
{"text":"Sooo...Brat Haus was pretty amazing for me.  The beer selection was absolutely amazing. Was it pricey? Yes. I was there on a Monday night around 9 pm. They had two of my three all-time favorite beers--Bell's Two-Hearted Ale on tap and Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA. The beer trifecta would have been completed if they had Bell's Hopslam, but that is my fault for not showing up at the right season.  Sure. When the DFH 120 Minute IPA is $15/bottle, it's not cheap, but, again, it's not your mom's Black Label. The Bell's Two-Hearted Ale on tap has a wonderful aroma, and the DFH 120 had a raisin-y nose without being too malty or alcoholic. How can something at almost 20% ABV be so, to use a BSG term, fracking awesome?  The service was amazing. Both the server and bartender, at almost closing were extremely attentive, providing me with both drinks and water. Once closing time hit, I never felt the pressure to GTFO. They were great about it. A quality you don't usually encounter in bars nowadays.  As for the food? It was pretty good. But, dear readers, my main goal for that night was to try and find a venue serving Bell's. DFH was a lucky afterthought. That being said, it's got an interesting menu. It would be a shame not to try something off of it.  Given the excellent beer menu, I will definitely be back. if you like craft beer, you will love this place!"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of positives, however the service was unfortunately an overwhelming negative and the main reason for my 2 star review. I visited yesterday after the downpour and upon arrival the place was fairly busy, but nothing crazy. The Amy Winehouse hostess with a big bun on her head asked how many and we told her three. She said it would be a minute and asked us to have a seat. Twenty seconds later she turned around, clearly not recognizing my friend and I, and asked if we were waiting for a table for two.  \"Uh, no three,\" I replied. We were seated at a long table which was a little awkward because there was another group next to us at the same table but hey, at least we were seated. Our waitress greeted us, and was very friendly. She took our order and we did not hear from her again for ten minutes, when she came over to inform me they were tapped out of the beer I ordered. I quickly made another choice and then we waited another three minutes or so for the drinks to be brought out. Another five minutes later our baked pretzel came out and it was very good. It came with a honey, Dijon, and stone ground mustard, all of which were very good. Our waitress then came back to take our main order. I ordered the Pig Mac, my friends got a spicy brat, and I can't remember the other. At this point we were informed that fries (and everything) is Ala cart (LAME!) so we ordered a large fry to split. The food took about ten or fifteen minutes and during that time we had to flag our waitress down twice to ask for more drinks. The food however was a bright spot for all of us. Although I did not try my friends food they both agreed it was really good. I can say that I will definitely get the Pig Mac again as it was super tasty! Next, BEWARE THE ICE BIN! During our meal we were seated close to the serving station where there is an ice bin. The staff slammed the top of that thing down every 15-30 seconds and it is loud, so loud we jumped nearly every time they slammed it shut (Yes that loud!). So to sum up, food good, service bad. Hopefully they will get a groove going when the restaurant has been around a little while as this was their first week. However if I go back and the service is still as poor, I will not be returning. Oh and lastly, on our way out, another hostess story! As we were leaving the hostess said good bye. That was nice. However as we looked to our right we noticed the take out part of the restaurant sold brats so we turned around to take a look. When we turned around to walk back in the hostess that just said good bye to us, asked if we wanted a table. You can't make this stuff up!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a tasty bratwurst and a pint or two of good beer... if you take care and avoid a bartender named Kylee. Tall brunette with the personality of a door knob and the customer service skills to match. She really put a damper on our small group's enjoyment of this place. We phoned and spoke to Mike the General Micro-Manager about our experience some days later and he could have cared less. Way to run a restaurant amigo!  Space is very cool with a bar building on one side and the main restaurant on the other side of a driveway... this all topped off by an area courtyard full of wooden picnic tables and an impressive grill. Great set-up.  Food was very good. Too many odd German beers on tap however. Establishment would be wise to concentrate on more American craft brews as they are as fresh as can be... and they'd be supporting these operations. Bring back most of the Belgian styles when it's not 107 F outside.   Would try this joint again but only if the bartender working really cared about the customer. Will not tolerate this type of indifference from an establishment. Plenty of other restaurants all up and down Scottsdale Road happy to take our business."}
{"text":"Congratulations Dave and Payton - delivering a concept Scottsdale has been thirsting for (pun intended).  We were there yesterday for lunch, during the unexpected downpour, and the place was packed. Everyone inside avoiding the rain and the vibe was great.  I can imagine how wonderful it is going to be sitting outside on a warm evening.  I'll be back for that.   We ordered the fries, homemade pretzel, a regular beer brat with sauerkraut and the spicy brat.  The homemade pretzel is a standout.  Perfectly cooked - a yummy cloud of floury heaven with a chewy crust and the perfect amount of salt on top.  A very simple item but almost impossible to prepare perfectly and the Brat Haus did it. I paired it with the (non-alcoholic) ginger beer, which is a must try.   Both the brats were great, served on a really fresh bun and presented on a cool tray with a small side of Payton's pickled cauliflower. Lots of sauces available on the table, which up the fun factor.  Curry Ketchup anyone?  The fries weren't as hot as I would have liked, but chalk that up to an incredibly busy kitchen trying to keep up with the demand on the opening week.    My only complaint? The flavors are so yummy and seductive, I wanted more!   More please.  And, next time, with the Nutella milkshake spiked with a dram of whiskey.     Thanks Brat Haus for delivering a fun and flavorful alternative to the oh,so boring wine bars!!"}
{"text":"Brats, spicy mustard, and sauerkraut? Yes please! I also did their Tour de Tavern a year ago and had a blast!"}
{"text":"Cool place, nice ambiance, and great beer selection. However, the brat was a major disappointment.  It was shockingly dry.  I am from the midwest, where good brats are described as \"juicy\". This brat had no juice. None.  Frozen brats that we buy in the store back home are juicy, and far, far tastier."}
{"text":"Thought we'd try something new.  Beer menu was great, as was the Dunkelweiss. Sorry to say that the brats were less than satisfactory - tasty, but quite overcooked and very dry.  Apricot chutney and root beer onions... meh.. nothing added any lusciousness to this meal, including the cold, dry saurkraut."}
{"text":"My favorite bar in Scottsdale! They have lots and lots of German and Belgium beers on tap and even more in bottles. The staff is extremely knowledgable which is alway a plus for trying something new that you'll like. Especially the manager Matt, he knows how to pick the right beer! The brats are made in house and fantastic. The Belgium fries with your choice of dipping sauce are even better."}
{"text":"I definitely enjoyed the brat I got. Quality tasty ingredients from the bun, through the mustard they had there. Very nice. The pretzel I ordered was a little dry, but I appreciated the artisan quality it had - not your usual SuperPretzel hanging from a metal rod above a light bulb.  As another person mentioned, the food isn't your traditional German style. They're pulling inspiration from German fare, but creatively altering it to make it an enjoyable culinary experience.  If this place lowered it's beer prices a little (wink wink), it'd steal a lot of traffic from Tempe, me thinks. :)  I think this place is the choice for a date if you both want to drink beer with dinner. You also have Scottsdale to play around in afterward."}
{"text":"I was teetering between rating this place a 3 or a 4, but went with the 4 because at the end of the day, I know we'll be back.  We stopped by Saturday night after a lonnnnnng day of home repairs. The hubs deserved some good eats, so we headed over to the Brat Haus, as my hubs is a lover of all thing meat. (Wait, that can come off in a bad way... nevermind. He loves dead animal. How about that?)  We arrived shortly after a massive rain storm had hit, and the sky was still pretty dark & grey. The hostess immediately went to serve us outside, and I asked \"What is the plan should it start to rain again?\" Her answer: \"Ummm... I guess just run as fast as you can inside.\" Cute. I'm 6 months pregnant. Not happening. I ask her if there is anything inside available - and she says no. I told her we'd wait. And she sort of huffed back to the hostess stand. Sorrrryyyyy for not wanting to get stuck in the rain.  We get back to the hostess area, and take a seat. We took a look and see how the place had changed from the Oregano's days. It was really neat! They took the parking area and created a large patio-type-seating place. Definitely would be great on a spring afternoon. As we were told that it'd be 15 minutes before we could be sat, imagine our surprise when moments later the hostess walked over and said, \"I just bused a table inside for you, so we are set.\" Hooray!  We walked inside, and to our surprise THERE WAS NO ONE SEATED INSIDE. Well, that's a lie, there were two couples. But there were about 15 seats available. Seriously? No seating inside? I get annoyed with bad service far more than I get annoyed by bad food.   So we sit. Our server pops over and explains the menu. Quite an interesting selection of Brats, and I was happy to see they had burgers & salads as well. The hubs ordered a beer (forgot the name) and I ordered a root beer. We also ordered a pretzel to split.  The pretzel came, and was HOT. Fresh out of the oven, which is awesome, however it was SO hot we couldn't eat it for about five minutes while it cooled. When it was cooled, we took bites and it was good! Not life changing, but it worked. The root beer was Dad's Rootbeer, served ice-cold out of the bottle. The hubs said his beer was 'thick'. I took his word for it, but he finished it & liked it.   For dinner, the hubs ordered the 'celebrity chef special' brat which that week was something by Justin Beckett, and I ordered a cheese burger. We also ordered a side of fries to split.  The food came quickly and was yummy. The hubs ordered his Brat with the rootbeer onions on top, which were OK, but he thinks he'll go a different direction in the future. My burger was awesome - perfectly cooked and the sides & sauces on top were perfectly mixed. The 'Hush Hush' sauce they put on top is basically a thousand island... or McDonald's 'Secret' sauce. Get it? Hush-Hush vrs Secret Sauce? Hilar.  The fries were good, and the sauce we had selected - the Blue Cheese Bacon - to dip them in was good. Kind of watery, but you definitely got a smoked bacon taste as you ate.  We were meeting friends for dessert or I would have been ALL OVER the shakes or floats I saw heading out of the kitchen.   We'll definitely go back and try more menu items... I'll just make sure not to have high expectations for the hostess staff. For now at least..."}
{"text":"Have wanted to try this place for a while, so my co-workers and I decided to stop in for an early lunch today. We were the only people in the restaurant for most of our visit. Our server was a very friendly, bearded gentleman, and the food was delicious. Unfortunately, the overall experience was not a good one due to high ticket times. We ordered pretzel appetizers and they took FOREVER. Our server apologized numerous times for this and said that he would take care of them for us. However at the end, the pretzels were still on our bill. The rest of the food arrived in a fairly reasonable amount of time after the pretzels, and was delicious. But by the time we finally got our checks and paid, we had been there for over an hour. It was baffling to me since they weren't busy and I left with a bad taste in my mouth. So disappointed, since I love German food, but I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"The atmospheres is great with a fun outdoor area and plenty of space for groups to hang out and play some fun games. That's the good part besides the expansive selection of beer on their menu and what you should really be focused on as the food is mediocre at best.   While I definitely like that they are carrying \"natural\" meat products from suppliers such as Niman Ranch, their fries didn't deserve the tag Belgian and their sausages had nothing to do with the German Bratwurst original besides the name.   So I guess this place is really just for people who think (or don't) that the √º \"Umlaut\" in Bratha√ºs  must be a sign of authenticity.   Speaking of authenticity...why make a patron wait to be seated if communal tables in the Biergarten are readily available? I'd open up the awesome outdoor area for everyone to just go and find their favorite spot.   If you can ignore all of the above (as I did) and just come here for loud fun and drinks you will still have a good time!  Just don't expect the food to keep up with it.  Three stars for the atmosphere and beer selection."}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere, and the food is cheap and good! I like how unique it is. The sauces are great and the toppings on the brats. Fun place! Will return!"}
{"text":"Super gem√ºtliches Ambiente,  urig und fast wie Zuhause ;) Service war freundlich und bem√ºht ohne Arsch freundlich zu sein.  Besonders nett finde ich das Angebot kostenlos Tischtennis und Riesen-Jenga spielen zu k√∂nnen.  Das Essen war klasse!"}
{"text":"Bartender Erinn is awesome!!...don't order food unless you have 2 hours to spare. I can't review the food because we canceled after waiting for an hour and a half."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 8. The location and atmosphere is nice when you are with the right people however the food and waiter big boo!  After being seated we waited for 10-15 minutes for the waiter to greet us, 30 min later we finally got our first beer, no apologies from the waiter and an hour later we got the food. Second beer order took just as long...   Apple pie was as bad as it can be, we had to return it. I have to say my friend has never returned food in her entire life.  Chicken was deep fried - German authentic food is never deep fried however it is an German expired place, please keep in mind its NOT GERMAN FOOD! Fries were decent so 2 stars for that!"}
{"text":"Service: Excellent! The server was so friendly and personable. I felt like he really cares about his guests and not just to get tips.   Food/Drinks Quality: Average. I'm not that much into brauts, but I wouldn't go anywhere else. Pretzels with cheese were ok. Drinks were ok too.   Ambience: Very casual. It's great for families, kids, and dogs!! There's corn hole, jenga, and ping pong for play.   Parking: Absolutely sucks! It's mainly street parking, which is obnoxious and doesn't make me want to return."}
{"text":"Good brat. Great fries! I enjoyed my meal,but i would have preferred the curry sauce to be on the side for dipping not drowning in it. Fried spaetzle could have used gravy ,at least a little. A nice addition would have been a slice of pumpernickel bread or even pretzel bun.The 6 pack of condiments was a very good idea. Our service was good even thou the fries arrived a few minutes after our food. The area we were in was small and could be noisy if all tables had been filled.It was a bar atmosphere as the name implies."}
{"text":"One of Phoenix area's absolute best. Haus burger is worth stacking double. Seriously is a peace that you should not pass up. I recommend t to EVERYONE that comes in town."}
{"text":"Servers are top notch, food is impeccably crafted, atmosphere is amazing. A step above, truly and irrevocably. Taste everything!"}
{"text":"Pro:  quality food, nice ambiance, good service and attitudes, decent value.    Con: parking is brutal.   some of the beers are a little spendy.    Pound for pound this place is tough to beat.  Better for 3-4 couples.  Simple and casual with a nice touch of uptown class.  Attentive service.  Lamb sausage and pretzels + cheese dip, really good.   Good selection of sausages.  Upbeat servers add to the positive vibe of the place.   I can see this as a viable mini chain in phx.  Right product at the right time."}
{"text":"The outdoor area is good for dogs, not sure how pleasant it will be when the summer heat arrives.  They have a dog menu item.  The wait staff is super friendly, were very enamoured with out cute small dog.  We were there during happy hour on a weekday and it was not crowded, so it might be different later in the evening, but our dog was very quickly brought water by two different waitresses.  One of them took several pics with her cell phone.  Our food came quick, but later when the place was filling up I could see it was taking longer.  Menu selection is pretty limited and lacking many German dishes one expects to see at a German restuarant in the U.S., like black forest anything (ham, cake).  No studel.  Just basically sausages.  The cabbage soaked in a bit of vinegar is a far cry from sauerkraut,  The music was not too loud, very easy to have a conversation across the table, there was no rap or disco, sort of a pop golden oldies mix.  The beer selection was good.  Recommend this place for relaxed atmosphere, an appetizer and a beer during happy hour, then move on for dinner..."}
{"text":"Good food great brew. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"I just think the layout of this place it unique. 2 separate buildings with the patio between. You have to try the fresh warm pretzels with one of the tap beers! The Brat sampler gives you a great chance to sample the Chefs artistry with sausage. This place is like October fest in our back yard."}
{"text":"I discovered Brat Haus during a Sunday funday and it is such a gem! It is a little farther from Old Town but definitely worth it if you are a big hot dog fan like moi. Their back patio is spacious and inviting with tetherball, ping pong, Bocce ball and large Jenga.   We actually did an event here and they were very accommodating with no food and beverage minimum unlike the other places nearby. The beers are great and the brats are even better. If you don't know what you want, get the brat sliders, you get to sample 3 of their most popular brats and it is very filling. Yes it is a little pricey for a hot dog, but please keep in mind that you are in Scottsdale, real estate is pricey. For vegetarians, fries, the garden burger and pretzels are really your only options. They should look into a veggie dog."}
{"text":"Wow! With ratings like I saw I was expecting a lot more. I suppose if Id just come for the beer it would have been grand. However, i went for the food and was sorely disappointed. I wasn't impressed by their small selection of German food. I ended up ordering a schnitzel (only pork option, no veal) corn salad (not german by any stretch but since I was ordering the fries I didn't want two spuds) and fries. The schnitzel that was brought to me was about the furthest thing from. There were 3 very small pork patties breaded in what seemed (tho i could be way wrong) to be a panko breading. I don't even think they added any spices. Bland as can be. And at 14 bucks seriously? The fries were pretty good as was the curry ketchup. The only good thing about about the lunch was the drink I ordered and the staff. The staff was very polite and friendly."}
{"text":"This resturant is NOT a german food resturant as google says. Last time we ate here it was good and had red cabbage and other german items besides all the sausage. Now it is only a beer bar wih sausage. It was good last time we ate here but we did not even stay this time since they changed their menu and removed about anything German except sausage."}
{"text":"We've been twice now. Had the sweet brat both times and have also tried the rabbit brat and the duck brat. All three were fantastic. The beers were excellent too. However, the best part of the whole night was the Drunken Date Cake. Hands down my new favorite cake."}
{"text":"wow, if you like sausage, this place is for you. patio is fabulous and fun. draft beer selection is great and comes in big steins. but if you have a delicate constitution meat-wise you would probably say \"eh, just ok\""}
{"text":"Beer = delicious as usual. Service = decent Atmosphere = great Authenticity = decidedly lacking  I really wish I'd just gotten a Brat as I know that's what's supposed to be good here. But, as soon as I saw schnitzel on the menu my mouth was watering for it. So I ordered it. It was not schnitzel. Over greasy, over rich, and the gravy was all wrong. It tasted very American. It was also rather tough, not at all right. For $16 a plate I was pretty bummed by the end of the meal. For a better attempt at German good in the valley check out Haus Murphys in Glendale. If your craving is as serious as mine you won't be satisfied until you're settled into an authentisch J√§gerschnitzel in a countryside Gastst√§tte enjoying the gem√ºtlichkeit."}
{"text":"5/5 for beer selection, 3/5 for food - 4/5 for ambience .....Awesome Biergarten feel.!  I thought the previous reviewers misjudged the food a bit - but I completely agree now.  Had the schnitzel & a half liter of HB.. Kids had the schnitzel fingers & fries, wife enjoyed a pretzel and weihenstephan hefe...    IMHO - the gravy served with the schnitzel is....  Umm.   \"Meh\"....   Bring in a mushroom / \"jaeger\" style sauce & it would jump...  WAY up in flavor...  And it would compliment the hot potato salad immeasurably..   (Well, that's an exaggeration - I'd bump it one full star for sure...).    I do plan to return. Gotta get that 5 star combo....  :)"}
{"text":"Lots of interesting options. I liked the Spicy Brat, and the fried pickles were great."}
{"text":"If I were going somewhere with a group of friends to drink and nibble, this would be the place.  Going with my wife and kid, maybe not the best.  Beer selection was good. Not the best in town but better than your average bar.  Inside bar area was way too small.  I thought the beer selection would be a little more extensive.  Food was okay, didn't wow me (except the sauces were impressive.  Took forever to get our initial order of fries and brat sampler.  It seems to me this place really caters to bigger groups (we were asked to move for one) and doesn't pay too much attention to smaller parties.  Server even complained to us that he has tables in 3 different rooms.    Frankly I went in with really high expectations because I love beer, brats and beer gardens.  I was probably holding the bar a little too high. I do love the outdoor seating and the big community tables.  The way a beer garden should be!  I think the place is still getting its footing and we will try again in a few months!"}
{"text":"Still a great place to have a drink.  The menu hasn't really changed over the years...which is good but a little sad.  I'd love to be able to try new food here."}
{"text":"For starters, a kitschy spelling doesn't make you a German restaurant, and to be fair, I don't think that's what the owners had intended, so I think those that would judge this restaurant's German authenticity are a little off the mark. With that said, what I'm about to say may make a lot of fanboys and girls very upset, as I understand that Chef Curry is a star in the valley, and I've been to a few of his past endeavors and quite agree that the mans talents are undeniable...but for me and my party, Brat Haus seemed to have everything down except for the food.   The decor is a very cool blend of modernist artsy, and industrial minimalist. Very cool. The service might have been a stretched a little thin, like one reviewer also mentioned, we were sitting at one of the few tables inside, when most of the servers tables were presumably outside, and we felt a little bit like we were at the \"kids\" table during thanksgiving dinner...a little slapdash \"heres your order and your check, thanks for coming.\"   First, the good. There is no shame in the beer list. No shame, Weihenstephaner Hefe, yes please...anytime I can. La Fin du Monde from Unibrou? absolutely...and these are probably two of the most commercial beers out of their selection, so if you've never heard of them, you can imagine what kind of paradise lies waiting for the average beer geek. Just wish those beers had gotten to us a little sooner, and that we might have been asked if we wanted another round. Again, when your at the kids table, just a sip of thanksgiving wine is all you can hope for.  If we could rate the place on their beer and fries alone, this would be a whole different review. Belgian Fries, truffle aoli...they honestly couldn't have been more perfect.  But it should be about the brats, yes? Partly on our failure, we went straight to the out of the box gourmet section. We had the rattlesnake rippers (rattlesnake sausage) , and the duck duck dates (Date and duck sausage), our logic being we can make beer brats at home, (Damn good ones mind you, if I don't say so myself. but, I guess I just did.), point being we decided to forego the mundane and see what an accomplished Chef known for his skill with cured meats could whip up instead. This was in retrospect a mistake. Both the rattlesnake and the duck at the end of it all, had us craving some good ole beer brats instead.  We found these two dogs, uninspired and not nearly as exciting as the quirky names or exotic meats might suggest. The rattlesnake. tasting like dry chicken, was insufficiently seasoned, moist less, and awkwardly skinny in a consequently overwhelmingly sized bun. We could  taste neither duck nor dates, in the Duck, Duck Dates sausage, and we had already polished off the fries before the stark realization set in that these dogs were not going to get even close to filling us up. Sharing our disappointments with each other, our party tried to place our proverbial fingers on the source of our ennui, and realized that everything was under seasoned, and we had failed in choosing the appropriate toppings for our peculiar dogs. (You have to pick one before they arrive) We chose pickled red onions, and spicy peppers. We agreed that given the Chefs history, we would have liked to see more of an active hand in his condiment pairings, rather than see a short list of condiments to choose from, i.e....we recommend apricot onion chutney with the duck and date sausage, or better yet, not even a suggestion, but more of an insistence, showing the confidence to say, we know how this rattlesnake shows its best and thus have served it with this fill in the blank accouterment. Left to our own devices and not having known that we wouldn't have classic dog garnishment, i.e...ketchup, mustard, relish...we were left there with our skinny, dry, under seasoned wieners, some sad not so spicy peppers, which helped a little with flavor but not with the dryness...and nothing else.   Dessert was the Drunken Date Cake, which was so blas√©, it had us all hunger games dueling for the measly scoop of vanilla ice-cream melting at its side.  Total: 2 dogs, 2 beers, some fries, and one dessert: $43   Yelp rating system classifies 2 stars  as \"meh, Ive had better\" and really thats the best way to describe this experience. If you decide to check out brat haus, my advice is to skip the fancy for now, go straight for the classic, and enjoy some great beers. We however, chose not to take the chance on ordering more, and decided to go and get something to eat. Not something you necessarily want to have to think about as you're leaving a restaurant with $43 bucks less in your pockets, but the truth nonetheless."}
{"text":"A bunch of us went to Brat Haus for my buddy's birthday as what better way to ring in your special day than with brats and cold beer with friends??? We decided to sit outside in their \"beer garden\", so I can't really speak to the decor of the place. The patio area is a nice size with several very large picnic-style tables. Not exactly wow factor, but then again we're talking about bratwurst, not Beluga...  It wasn't crowded, so we had our choice of where to sit. It looks like there is an outdoor bar, too, but it wasn't open that night.   The beer list gets an 'A' from me. It's pretty much all craft beers and they have plenty on tap and in bottles. Nice variety of styles and regions represented. The prices seemed reasonable for many of the selections (I went with a domestic pilsner that was $5/pint). However, some of the beer options can get spendy, but I like that they offer something for everyone. If you want wine, well, go find another restaurant. Who drinks wine with brats anyway??   Which brings us to the food... Some items were very good, others were just so-so. Sadly the so-so food happened to be the main attraction on the menu.   I tried the beer brat, the kosher beef dog, and the chicken sausage with roasted chiles. Of the three, the brat was the best, but that's just winner by default because the other two were so average. The seasonings were solid, but they all seemed dry. And all the toppings on the menu really don't matter much when the meat underneath is dry.    However, the Belgian fries were great. Crispy, but not burnt, with just the right amount of salt. The dipping sauces I tried were all good, save for the 'Hush Hush Sauce'. Skip that unless you like incredibly average 1000 Island Dressing. I'd go with the bleu cheese & bacon sauce, the sriracha aioli, or the white truffle aioli (it's pretty mild).   Another food winner were the pretzels. Two very large, hearth-baked soft pretzels with a three cheese dipping sauce. Plenty to share (or you can just choose to keep all that warm pretzel goodness to yourself). They also have stone ground mustard which was excellent with these.   As for the service, it was great. We had two servers attending to us and they were never away for long. They offered solid advice on the beer list (i.e. beer sommeliers) and also gave some honest opinions on the food.   Was the experience OK overall? Yes it was, but I can't really give them higher than 3 stars due to the fact they are the 'BRAT Haus' and I felt the brats & sausages were really just average. If I could rate them on other items alone, then they'd get 4 stars from me.   Will I be back? Yeah, probably, but I'll order the pretzels and a beer. Hey, sometimes it's the simple things...

{"text":"Sorry, not impressed!  I was so excited to take our family to dinner here tonight (7-13-2012)  I think I worked myself up on expectations and everything fell short.    First, we were told a 10 min wait for a table for 2 adults and 4 kids, we waited over 45 minutes and watched everyone who came in behind us get seated.  Imagine the anxiousness of our kids!!  While waiting, the host asked us if we wanted anything, but then told us that she couldn't actually serve us???  What?  She then proceeded to tell us to get up and go order whatever we wanted from the cashier at the bar, but that they couldn't serve us because they were afraid the kitchen would get overwhelmed!!!  Ok, really?  The hosts need a lot of training, a lot!!!!  Finally, we get a table, we ordered some beer brats, Haus burgers and some fries.  Everything was just \"ok\".  The buns are way bigger than the brats, a couple of the buns were soggy, the sauerkraut tasted like it came out of a can and was cold!  Pretzel was good, dipping sauces were unique and good.  Prices for food were fair, but the beer was expensive.  The ambiance was great, clean and new.  But I didn't come to spend $75  to look at some furnishings and interior design work.  The waiter himself tried hard and did a good job.  He brought our kids free cookies as an apology, I didn't actually get one, but they told me the cookies rocked!  I wish he would have given the bill to the kids too!  Really wish this was a good review, but it just started all wrong with a terrible first impression.  I would wait to visit after a few months of them trying to get it right, or, just don't waste your time or $$ at all!!"}
{"text":"Had a hankering for grilled hot dogs with all the fixins',  when my husband came home and mentioned Brat Haus.  Newly opened in Oregano's old flagship location in Old Town Scottsdale, this place was great!  The servers are all attentive and helpful with suggestions and the beers are plentiful.  We enjoyed a Spaten Oktoberfest and a Krombacher Pils.  With over two dozens brews on draft, it was hard to decide. No domestics here, friends, and that's the way it should be.  We were recommended the fundido, stone hearth-baked pretzels, perfectly salted and served with a creamy cheese sauce and spicy mustard. For dinner, the Spicy Brat with root beer grilled onions and Apricot Onion Chutney.  They use Niman Ranch pork, chicken and beef for all of their sausages which made me instantly add another star to my review.  The  Spicy Brat's casing was perfect...soft yet snappy and not too thick. I was happy with the sausage. Next time, I'll order the Beer Brat. The Apricot Chutney was also delicious! For our side, we chose fries with Truffle Aioli and Bleu Cheese-Bacon Sauce.  Both of their sauces were good as well. For dessert...well, I was way too full to even consider it, but when Dave Andrea himself highly suggest you get the Drunken Date Cake...you DO IT! I will return JUST to get a piece of this cake again.  Dave was right...the cake did not make it to the next day. Made with oatmeal stout and topped with ice cream and caramel sauce...this was phenomenal. My husband and I fought over who got the last bite!   We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Ate here last night and was very impressed with the set up. Beer selection was excellent (liked that they use the proper glasses for each tap selection). Food was above average. Pretzels were well done and my sweet brat came with a tasty chutny sauce on top. The roll had a fresh, soft consistency to it. That's not easy to do in AZ thanks to our hard water. And it really feels like an old German beer hall. The decor inside was appropriately done. I'm looking forward to cooler days where we can sit outside in the biergarten. My only beef is that a lot of items are overpriced. I understand it's located in the midst of Scottsdale. And they make the effort to offer freshly made items on site (as far as I could tell). But I used to frequent several of these types of restaurants in other cities and they were not this expensive. The brat wasn't so mind-blowing that I'd step it up and order a specialty one that's $8+. If they were bigger, maybe. A lot of the beers are a buck or two higher than they should be as well. Especially the Belgians. Compared to other places. I hope the Brat Haus is here to stay. I'll recommend it to everyone. It's not your typical Scottsdale eatery which is a good thing."}
{"text":"I have eaten dinner here twice, each time having to send something back to the kitchen because it wasn't cook correctly (chicken wings served with cold bones and dry meat, fried egg way over cooked,  'Sriracha-butter sauce' is just Sriracha). This bar gets everything else right; environment, beer selection, front of house staff and the menu sounds delish (unfortunately the kitchen is not able to deliver). Go here for beer, only."}
{"text":"I've probably been to Brat Haus 15 or so times. It is one of my favorite go-to spots that I recommend to friends. The food is great! My favorites would be any of the brats, the garlic fries (so good), or the tomato and burrata salad. Your dog can eat free on Sunday's too (they make a special sweet potato brat)! Also, Brat Haus has a really fun outdoor vibe; you can play bags, ping pong, etc. You can even get all brats and all the fixing's to-go for you own BBQ. I only will give it 4 stars because service can regularly be sub-par. But the food keeps bringing us back!"}
{"text":"Went here last night with friends for dinner. This place has a great outdoor patio/Beer Garden where you can enjoy a couple of litters outside on a cool night and have some brats, pretzels and fries. It's a super casual fun atmosphere and they have ping pong, jenga and corn hole that you can play. Will definitely be back. They had a live german band playing which was a nice touch. The food was good. The chorizo brat is extremely spicy so beware!! Overall we had a great night and I will definitely be going back there to relax with friends and enjoy some good beers. They have an outstanding selection so if you are a beer enthusiast you will like this place!"}
{"text":"Great place, food is awesome, had the pretzel, belgian fries and the spicy bratwurst charcuterie style which was amazing with the apricot onion chutney on the side. Good selection of beers and a cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Can't say this is the healthiest place, but definitely a great place when looking for something other than a burger. A great mix of brats with toppings. Been here multiple times and all very good. I definitely get cravings for this place. I do wish they had a veggie brat option though. They also got games like giant Jenga and corn hole toss. Just wish the parking situation was easier, but since they bought the property next door it should improve soon"}
{"text":"Probably one of my best and most memorable dining experiences in awhile.  Our waitress, Ashley was attentive, fun, and joked around with us.  She knew her beers and food.  We were later checked on by the chef who was just as awesome as the waitress.  Explained how the food was made and that a lot of the ingredients were local and even gave us a tour of the kitchen.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Brat Haus and while the patio and beer are phenomenal the food was a bit off in my opinion. The pretzels were cold, my brat was dry and the onions were overly sweet. That being said we had an amazing time playing ping pong and corn hole. The beers were phenomenal and the patio is perfect. I'm chalking it up to a bad night in the kitchen, but will definitely be back on my next visit to Arizona."}
{"text":"Love this place.   Their beer selection is great. They rotate out their selection often, and they have a lot of great stuff you won't find elsewhere. It's great to be able to always try new and very well selected drafts.  Their food generally is excellent. At this point, I've tried almost everything on the menu. There are a few dishes that weren't that great, but enough that are excellent to more than make up for those.   The Fundido pretzels and cheese are great. All of the brats I've tried were excellent. I like the Pig Mac, Schnitzel, pig tail poutine and pretty much everything I've tried. The deep fried ribs were one of the few misses I've had here. I also was a little disappointed that they took their greens house salad off the menu. The replacement the raw salad is pretty good, but not nearly as good as the former greens salad.  This place is also great for groups, my team at work comes here almost weekly for team lunches and it's become our go to spot."}
{"text":"I always have a great time when we come here. The staff is always friendly, the beer selection is outstanding, and the atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch today a little after 1:00 pm and the place was almost empty.  I ordered and waited and waited and waited.  After over 30 minutes I walked to the kitchen and asked , How long does it take here?\"  The guy sweeping the floor said, \"What are you waiting for?\"  He was clueless. He asked who my waiter was but at that point I couldn't wait any longer and left.  What a joke of a place.  I wonder what they do when they're BUSY!!"}
{"text":"I had a great first experience at the Brat Haus! Danielle our server was extremely knowledgeable and attentive. We had the scrumptious pretzels, with a side beer brat, a spicy brat, Belgian fries,, and the haus favorite burger. EVERYTHING had sooo much flavor we couldn't stop commenting on it.   I will absolutely be returning to the Brat Haus!"}
{"text":"Good beer. Bad facsimile of German food"}
{"text":"I'm from Germany and the food is not authentic at all.I had the Oktoberfest plate and tried everything,did not like it. In my mind they should have not charged me for it since they asked me what was wrong and I told them I did not like it. Well I certainly won't come back"}
{"text":"What a cool concept: quality brats and great beer all around! Paid my visit for a weekday lunch, so it wasn't very crowded. The beer brat sandwich I had was fantastic (great hoagie!). I added some sauerkrat and sweet peppers to it to give it a little umph, and it was great. The Belgium fries were also a pleasant surprise as well. I didn't order a beer but I was excited to see all of the types of beer they had on tap.....next time! Our server was on the ball and amazing. What else can I say......except I want to go back!"}
{"text":"The Brat Haus is great for good food and a laid back atmosphere! The food selection is great and the employees are attentive. I love the outdoor consent the restaurant has and the games they have out to play. I went with two friends for a relaxing night out and had a blast! I tried a little bit of everything. I had a pretzel with beer cheese, fries (that were amazing), and two sliders (I would highly recommend the German). We all got mule variations to drink which were really good too! I would highly recommend this place and will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"The place is a fun, little hole-in-the-wall with a great beer garden for outdoor dining.  The fries are delicious and with all the different dipping sauces we had to have two orders!!  Everyone had a different brat so we could share and it was hard to tell which was better.  I definitely like the lamb, best.  If it's not really crowded you can bring your dogs as long as they're quiet and well-behaved.  Not cheap, but definitely good and fun."}
{"text":"We just had a great dinner here! The beer choices are amazing and the brats are just delicious. We will be going back soon. A must try."}
{"text":"Super fun environment, great food & drinks. I can't order anything besides the bacon sliders (with tomato jam) because they are THAT yummy! Only complaint, the tetherball was a lil rough on the hands ;) but, then again where else can you find a tetherball in Old Town?!!"}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere, and beer selection however a couple details are missing.   Me and some friends went and checked out Brat Haus in the afternoon/evening on a Friday night and overall it was a great experience. I was impressed with the menu and love the concept of beer first, food second. I had the spicy brat with an assortment of toppings which came out to around $7, which I would say was worth it.  We also got a large fries as an appetizer and I was very impressed, especially with the dipping sauces.  Why not 5 stars? I have run in to this WAY too much from places like Brat Haus. They set a great German mood with their Brats and import craft beer selection, so you really start to get into a German pub mindset then......Nickleback comes blasting onto the speakers. You put all this effort into making me feel like I am in a German, craft beer, easy going environment, but then you play a pop station that plays Nickleback and Lady Gaga. Take a couple days, make a playlist that goes with your atmosphere, this is important! The crowd here isn't the typical Scottsdale crowd, so they shouldn't play the typical Old Town Scottsdale music.  Other than this, great place and I will definitely be returning to play that strange washers game!"}
{"text":"Group of six of us went for Happy Hour on a Saturday evening.  Even though they were busy we were sat rather quickly within about 10 mins of waiting. You must sit outside before it gets too hot.  Absolutely awesome outside area, large tables, plenty of room it really gives off a beer-garden vibe.  Our waitress was all over it and never missed a beat, she was obviosuly very busy but our drink levels never dipped below halfway before she was back asking if we were ready to try another beer.  She was very knowledgeable of the different beers and menu items to pair them with and offered up samples of beer.  The atmosphere was very comfortable / casual for Scottsdale.  We only had apps with our many beers,   pretzels with cheese  dip, ribs and the brat sliders that we had were amazing.  Everyone in our group was having such a great time we hated to leave for our dinner reservations at Barrio- next time we are staying for dinner!  We are all fans and will be back,  if we didn't live on the Westside we would be here every Friday for the Happy Hour and fun atmosphere!  Great place with awesome food and the waitress we had was outstanding!  The Brat Haus hit all the marks on service, food and ambiance."}
{"text":"Worst Brat I have ever had(dry, overcooked, bland).  Everyone's food was cold and we waited an hour for our food and it was not even busy!  The group sharing the table with us also said that it was the worst service and food that they have had in a long time.  Too bad.  I was hoping for a great place."}
{"text":"Was there last night with high hopes. The pretzel was good but my excitement was soon diminished with the main course. We both had the Wiener schnitzel , no flavor whatsoever. Not worth the drive."}
{"text":"Fantastic beers, beer-knowledgeable servers, great but limited food menu, and extremely pleasant outdoor seating in a lovely courtyard off the street.  couldn't be better unless it was walking distance from my house!"}
{"text":"There's so much right about this place, I'm not sure where to begin! The beer selection is AMAZING, and the bartender let me sample a few (on tap, of course) before I made my selection. I am a fan of wheat beers, but there's a certain flavor I've never been able to tolerate in about half I've had. When I explained this to the bartender after my first sample, she knew exactly what I was talking about, and told me it's the type of the yeast used. She then gave me a sample of one that didn't have that particular flavor. I love it when someone not only listens, but engages on the topic with knowledge!  Since we were sitting at the bar, our bartender was also our server. She recommended the Chicken Thai sausage with the apricot chutney (after hearing me say I wanted something spicy), and was once again steered in the right direction. It was incredible. We also ordered some of the Belgian fries with the bleu cheese and bacon sauce, also just beyond... Then, for the piece de resistance, we split a piece of the  Drunken Date Cake. I'm not even that big a fan of sweet food, but this cake... takes the cake.   Some customers came in when the kitchen was about to close, but were not turned away. The manager even told them he would fire up the grill and cook the order up himself if the kitchen were indeed closed. Talk about great customer service!  The music being played is great, the atmosphere is comfortable and completely unpretentious, the service is excellent, the food perfection... seriously, what more good stuff can I say?   I will not only be returning, but I will also be recommending this place to everyone I know!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. They had a group eating there at the same time but we still got great service."}
{"text":"My favorite place to grab a beer in Scottsdale. Have a pretzel for sure! Fresh with great mustards to try."}
{"text":"Indulged myself in some German dining this past weekend. It was a great atmosphere and the food tasted awesome. The pretzels were  unreal! Everyone was extremely kind, especially the hostess (dark hair). The wait was a little longer than I had hoped, but she made an effort to ensure we were doing well, and she kept us up to speed with why it was taking a little longer. Great service and I strongly recommend it.  Nick H."}
{"text":"Nice relaxed atmosphere. Delicious but expensive beer. $8 Brats that don't fill the bun. Hard wooden wobbly stools."}
{"text":"Great selection of Brats and other food items. I had the Hot Italian and it was delicious. A lot of different mustards and sauces to choose from, started with their homemade pretzels and fresh cut fries. All were hot and freah and the bun for the brat was also spot on. A huge selection of domestic, imported drafts and bottles as well. Great outdoor garden and staff was super attentive and knowledgable.  No complaints about anything from this visit."}
{"text":"Located in old town Scottsdale this little gem serves up Germanic foods with an Arizona twist: flavored mayonnaise for the fries, a huge variety of mustard, and a great selection of beer. The rattlesnake brat was delicious. Service was friendly and full of good suggestions about sauce choices, etc.. Parking can be a chore, but this is almost always the case in Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I have brought groups of 30 here 4 different times and each time it has gone exceptionally well. Eating here with the family tonight because my son likes the Nutella shake as much as I love the unique beer selection and boat sausage.  The location on Old Town Scottsdale is another plus and there is on site parking. It's basically perfect."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my fianc√© and a friend, I had the beet salad,my fianc√© hd the chirizo brat and our friend had the flight brat which came with 3 half brats and 3flight beers.... Everything was great ! We will definitely be coming back here....oh and great staff :)"}
{"text":"I'm always up for a Bratwurst and a beer, and since I was in the area, thought I would give this place a try.  I'm glad I did. I had coincidentally entered the bar, rather than the dining area; the bar, was of course, was where I wanted to be, so I was good!! It happened to be in the mid-afternoon, and it was very quiet - in fact, I was the only one there.  So I had a chance to talk with the bartender, take my time looking at the different types of beer, and getting recommendations not just on beer, but also on the food,  It was obvious that the bartender loved talking about the beer.  He had full knowledge of the many different types they had, and made several recommendations. I tried two of them, and they were great.  My main reason for stopping was for a bratwurst.  He made several suggestions on the food, and I finally tried the Beer Bratwurst, with the Rootbeer Onions, Sauerkraut, Spicy Peppers, and Relish toppings. It was delicious. The bun was rather large and dry - but it was just right with all the toppings and the condiments I added.  Great place - the service was very good, the bartender very helpful, the food was delicious and the prices were very reasonable. A great addition to Old Town!!"}
{"text":"Love love love love love this place. Did I mention that I love it?  What's not to love? Awesome selection of beer and brats. Awesome setting. Awesome service. Oh, and awesome prices - as in they won't break your bank like a lot of places in Scottsdale will.  If you like brats and beer (and even pretzels!) you owe it to yourself to get there soon."}
{"text":"Very fun atmosphere outside. We stopped for lunch and had a great time. The cheese curds and Belgian fries were wonderful. I wasn't crazy about the sausage choices but ended up with a polish that was very good. Our server Micah was great. Lots of choices of craft beers, and Micah was great with the recommendations."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a casual drink at Bru Haus (the bar connected to Brat Haus) after a day of hiking on a rather chilly day and this place was invitingly cozy and simple. My husband found the craft beer selection decent (we're from St. Louis which is one of the leading microbrew snob towns now, apparently). I had a malbec, the bill was reasonable, service attentive but not overbearing and the tables were filled but not crowded.   Atmosphere was happy but not excited/loud, even though most patrons seemed really invested in the Oregon football game playing out on the TV. We'dug this place as a casual stop after a day of exploring the nearby parks.  Didn't try any food as we had reservations at another restaurant in a few hours, but was pleasantly surprised about wandering in at happy hour ;)"}
{"text":"I'm full blood German and was excited for German food, beer and a great time. Our waiter had the worst attitude and took forever to bring us anything or just forgot completely. The food tasted like crap! The apfelstrudel was worse than what you get frozen at a supermarket back home. The idea and concept is great, but get a new chef and make sure your wait staff gets their crap together."}
{"text":"Food is really fresh here. The German potato salad is amazing. Next time I would add the brat and the egg as a meal. I had a traditional brat which was very good however the bun is too big. Don't need that much for a bun. Atmosphere is terrific an Hofbrau Helles on tap is authentic."}
{"text":"What a great addition to this city. A german style beer house with it's own beer garden and a graffiti wall that changes every four months. A great food menu and even better beer selection. I definitely want to get a large group of friends together to go here and have our own little Oktoberfest any time of year. The only downside was the service, the waiter looked like he would rather be anywhere else in the world. He never smiled."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great exotic brat section on the menu. Liter after liter of Krombacher Pils! Highly recommend and definitely coming back."}
{"text":"A lousy hot dog stand with expensive beer. Four of us went for lunch Sunday. Server was great, but service was slow because she had tables outside and we were inside. Ordered brats and they were severely overlooked and bad. The spicy one was so bad that it was hard all the way thru. The cook ought to go to Ted's to see how good brats are cooked! Tried Belgian Fries and they were so overcooked that they were black brown in color and totally crispy. Draft beer was almost warm and very expensive.  Food was very expensive too. Food served was cool, probably because it came from a building next door. We were in bar. Bill for 4 lunches and a couple of beers was over $160. My summary: A BAD HOT DOG STAND, OVERLY EXPENSIVE, WITH SOME GOOD BEERS ON TAP...BUT WARM. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Great outdoor place. But we got food poisoned from the saussages. I dont recommend eating them at all. We might come back for a beer, though."}
{"text":"Went to the Brat Haus with my family (all adults) and loved it! My favorite were the fresh, right out of the oven pretzels for sure however the brat I ordered was delicious, especially with the root beer onions on top. My daughter had the apricot onion chutney on top of her brat and that was excellent too. The fries were great and we all tried different drinks (beers and yummy concoctions that were fun). The service was great too. It is tricky to get a parking spot but I lucked out and parked on the street right in front of the place....that earned this place five stars in my book. I will be back."}
{"text":"I lumped Payton Curry in the same category as some of the other notable chefs who open and closes restaurant every 3 months. Even hearing how he supposedly stole the logo from the bike shop down the street fueled my displeasure. As someone who is in the industry, I was hating on the game which is an unwritten rule of the industry. So I hated Brat Haus before it even opened.  This past Thursday I was able to leave work early and meet my wife for dinner in Scottsdale. We decided to check out Brat Haus. I'm just going to talk about the food because that is what impacted me the most. Now, that damn Pig Mac has to be the single greatest creation in Arizona Culinary history. It was meaty, moist, flavorful and downright grubtastic. I literally have been thinking about when will I have the next chance to have the Pig Mac. The fries were killer with crispy tips that crunch like chips. The Thai sausage had great flavor but in my opinion could have been spicier but I love spicy foods. The unfiltered Hefe they have on tap was awesome. Everything was top notched from the seating in the bar to the sesame seeded burger buns.  In Summary, I have to eat dry chicken (crow). I was absolutely wrong about Payton Curry and his food. This chef can throw down. I will be back to partake in the heavenly creation of the Pig Mac. All hail the Pig Mac.  Chef, if you see some variation of the pig mac on my menu please don't sue me...LOL"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best rotating beer selections in the valley. They had Dogfish Head 120, which I had certainly never seen in Az. They also have a nice local selection and specialty selection (like Chimay).  The food is, from what I understand, Locally grown and slaughtered. The dude who owns the place is german, and makes his own brats and mustards, which I found to be delightfully tasty. The fries, however, have been woefully undercooked on the 2 occasions I have ordered them.  The atmosphere is fun and lively, if you are going on a friday or saturday night, it might be best to reserve a table. They have giant jinga, tetherball, ping bong and a bag throwy thingy.  The service can be a bit slow at times, but if you aren't in a hurry with a grandpa bed time, then it just lets you enjoy the company and surroundings more. I should say the food service is slow, but they never let my beer remain empty."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times and actually like their food and beer selections.  And the services has always been pretty good.  So why did I rate them 2 stars?  Because we tried to have our wedding rehearsal dinner here for 30 people and received no response from the manager.  We stopped in one day and spoke with an assitant manager who took all our information and assured us we would hear from the manager, Kevin E., later in the week.  Nope, that didn't happen.  I emailed Kevin.  I tried to call Kevin.  No response.  That is fine if you can't take our reservation and accomodate us, but let us know.  A quick email or phone call would be good customer service.  And it would have changed my 2 star review to a 4 or 5 star review."}
{"text":"A disappointment we were really hoping for German brats, not the usual brat you can get anywhere. Had the beer brat which had more spices then actual meat. Pretzels are good though!"}
{"text":"Did lunch today, first time there. Brat had decent flavor but I had a hard time finding it; the poor little thing was lost in the roll.  The bread to meat ratio was about 3 to 1 and that does not make for a good sandwich.  The belgian fries were also a bit disappointing.  Fine flavor-wise but they were all only about a 3/4 inch to 1 inch long.  Very strange, especially considering the focus on dipping sauces.  You could not dip them without getting your fingers in the sauce.  Sevice was OK, atmosphere more of a bar than a restaurant.  Overall not worth the drive."}
{"text":"Found this place here on Yelp, and what a find. Great beer selection, and excellent food. We got the bacon burger sliders for an appetizer, which were amazing. The kids devoured the pretzel and garlic fries. My wife had the Haus brat and I had the Pepperjack brat with sauerkraut, which was homemade and amazing. The whole family also had a great time playing the games out in the courtyard. We played giant jenga, corn hole and ping pong. We loved the food and just overall had a great time. We'll definitely be back when we're back in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Ive only been here once for drinks with some friends so my review is only based on the drinks and the PRETZELS!!! The pretzels were amazing! The drink selection was nice and our server was very friendly and helpful with describing all the different flavors of the beers. Nice little outdoor area and we played jenga before it was time to go."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. Can't wait to come back for a dinner, as opposed to the light appetites we showed up with today.  Had the ABTs and the Waffle Fries from the appetizer menu and they both rocked. My Bloody Mary (which contains some beer) was a nice peppery flavor. Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Wait what???  4 stars for a brat??? Exactly! One has to question how they ended up with 4 stars...unless wait it was a bunch of their friends and family or something.   Let's start with the server...when you're cool versed in that much ink...cover up. That body covered in that much ink and that lack of clothing made us lose our appetites.   So let's see...brat ink forgot to take our drink orders. Not that it mattered because even after she got the order she forgot to get the drinks.   The pretzel is the worst burnt-like pretzel ever. I am having a hard time to come up with words to describe that nastiness. The cheese sauce was so bad they had to put chives in it to give it flavor.   The garlic fries had this amazing flavor of week old burnt deep-frier oil combined with this oil soaked chewiness and undercooked potatoes. It is amazing how a fry cook could mess up fries this bad.   The brats...which they are know for...seem like they were sitting out in the AZ sun for days. Where else can one bite into a juicy brat and get dried up ground pork or boar or dog instead.  Come to the Brat Haus for this one of a kind experience!!!!  Take it one level better...slap that lifeless brat into a gooey chewy oversize hoagie roll. Cover it in one of their toppings sans sauerkraut and keep looking for the spicy mustard at your local grocery store...not here because warm Dijon is your best choice.   Should have know better as soon as I saw falafel on the menu...das es nichts gut!!!! Aufiderzein!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night and had Riley as our server. We came in about 10:30 and saw they closed at 11, but Riley couldn't have been any nicer about making us feel like we could stay and enjoy ourselves. He recommended a great hefe that I would go back for, and the pretzel was pretty good. It was definitely the service that would bring me back here for another beer!"}
{"text":"Perhaps it isn't the biggest beer selection in Scottsdale, but it is by far the best beer selection with most of my favorites on tap at any given time.  The food is awesome as well. But I come for the beer."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The atmosphere, music, and patio makes the food taste even better! I ordered the brat sampler and was very pleased. Great date night location in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. We sat outside and the service started out great. Drinks and delicious appetizers arrived quickly. That's where it ended. 4 entrees came out and the only one that was remotely edible was the \"dork\" burger (duck and pork). My wife's lamb sausage was burned to a crisp and the other two meals were just plain bad. Our waiter had vanished and a new server took his spot who was very pleasant. She did take the undesirable items off the check but I just could never go back. Serving a scorched black sausage is just plain inexcusable. At least 2 to 3 people should have seen it before it went out and they served it anyway which tells me they either were negligent or they saw it and didn't care. Either way that's a deal breaker for me.  The serving staff is the highlight of this place."}
{"text":"Brat Haus continues to be one of my favorite go-to's in the Old Town Scottsdale area. Their serious love for all meats encased and ridiculous love for mustard (and German beer) is enough to keep this place on my list to take visitors and friends alike.   The brats are delicious. Any choice is a sure winner, but my favorite is the spicy wurst with root beer onions on top - a great combo of a little savory/spicy/sweet that is so good. If it's your first time Id suggest the brat and beer flight, where you get to sample three different kinds of brats plus three five ounce beer tasters. It's kind of awesome.   Their pretzels are perfect. I think right now they have a yelp deal where if you check in you get a pretzel with a side of Nutella. They're just so good and crunchy and soft.   Also the fries - get them. And get the hush hush sauce (or the chipotle aioli, or the Sriracha aioli...), you won't regret it!  Did I mention the patio? Guys. The patio. The outdoor space is giant, with lots of options from big long picnic style tables to small two-tops, peppered with trees, heaters and misters that make it the perfect phoenix patio. They're ready for you whether you have a group of two or twenty - definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"It was ok. Went their for lunch on a Wednesday with a friend who is German. She ordered the curry something. She said the sauce was good but the brat was cold and she had to have it reheated. We ordered a pretzel and cheese for an appetizer and the taste was good (probably canned cheese) but the pretzel was tough. I ordered the tri tip sandwhich with German potato salad. The meat was good. The sauce was a bit too spicy for me. Bread was good. Potato salad was tart but that might be normal for German potato salad? We were the only people there so not sure if that's a sign. Also had to ask for salt and pepper. I Might give it another chance. Not sure"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome and friendly staff! New favorite place in Old Town! Try their \"Pig Mac\" Burger! Very tasty!!"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome vibe in the garden area!"}
{"text":"After posting my review last night, I got this response from the owner.  I appreciate the quick response and I'll gladly go back to meet the owner and give it another shot.    \"Sincerely sorry to hear about your experience last night. I'll find out what happened because we truly strive to provide a great experience in both food and service. If you decide to give us another chance, please introduce yourself to me or Kevin the GM, who was out sick last night, and we'll do our best to make up for last nights experience. Thanks for the feedback, we'll use it to get better.\""}
{"text":"Ummm!  Still not sure about this place.  The brats tasted reheated. Beer choices great. Pretzels are good. Server should probably working in the back room instead. Zero personality.  I think I may go back 1 more time to decide."}
{"text":"Visiting from LA and my son introduced me to Brat Haus. Fantastic sausage and beer. See Erica for help if you need it with the great menu. The lamb sausage with apricot chutney was out of sight. Have it with the Krombacher Pils, then have another! Hush-hush dipping sauce was our favorite with the fries. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a special of three sausages and special sides server gabe was incredible truffle a√Øoli dipping sauce was fantastic with very generous order of small fries Will return"}
{"text":"Really good food, really good beer (even though they were out of a lot), a steal for restaurant week."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is amazing! Food is incredible! I recently moved to Seattle and have been searching for a place similar to this and haven't found it yet. I'll keep searching but until then, I guess I'll just have to day dream about Brat Haus' amazing pretzels.. Siiiggghhh."}
{"text":"Please change the music in the bar it sucks makes me want to kill myself!!! Everything else is amazing"}
{"text":"This is a fun, unique place to grab some pub fare and hang with some new friends. I would have given them 5 stars but i felt like i was being looked down on when i went with a \"safe\" beer in the eyes of the server. I ultimately tried 3 new \"exotic\" beers (all of which were great) as he put it, but he still left a bad taste in my mouth.."}
{"text":"I'm a fan....I'm not a huge one but I am fan.  Outdoor patio is cool, we had the flight of brats and beer.  My favorite was the traditional brat the others were good but not as.  I think they could do a little more exciting stuff but the place works and is definitely worth trying.  I would absolutely go again."}
{"text":"Not your normal brat.... exotic meats and awesome beer selection!  Good vibe!"}
{"text":"If zero stars was an option I would choose that. Sad because the place has potential but I was treated extremely poorly there. We were there for the bar bike crawl and was told to byob. So we did. And we opened a beer. Then we had someone come up and rudely demand we pour out our beers and proceeded to rip a beer out of my friend's hand. Aggressively while she wasn't even looking. When I tried to apologize and explain that we were told to bring our own beer and we had no problem follow the rules (I totally get it! We had no problem with the rule. We were just misinformed. Not our fault.) he scolded us like we were two year olds in time out."}
{"text":"The beer is great, and the atmosphere is awesome! Now, for the complaints...my pretzel tasted microwaved...a bit soggy, not enough alternative healthy meat options, a movie playing on a Sunday with kids in the restaurant without warning with more F bombs than most truck drivers use in a lifetime...lastly and my biggest complaint...I appreciate the vegan option, albeit not that great in taste, that comes on a non vegan bun! Big oversight and a big fail!! They originally had the vegan option in a sausage form, but it was like an elongated falafel ball...now it is in patty form which was not an improvement, just a change in shape.   If I am correct in assuming that this concept was based on the W√ºrstkuche in Venice Beach, I suggest they take cues from their menu and offer more variety...and vegan items that are actually vegan!  Want to like this place more...being of German descent...but there are too many holes!!"}
{"text":"I'm going with 2 stars for the beer selection and the garden area along with good service. Food however is nowhere close to \"authentic\" German. Our group included one native German and four Yanks with lengthy time spent in Germany. None of us had more than a couple of bites of the potato salad, an odd dry concoction. Tip 'o the day...clean the dry clotted mustard out of the squeeze bottles."}
{"text":"The Belgian fries are as far from being Belgian as the Eiffel Tower is from San Francisco! I'm Belgian therefore believe I should know. The ones I got yesterday were burned and not eatable. As for the potatoe salad (supposedly German) same comment -- my husband is German therefore he should know! The Brat was OK, so was the Schnitzel which we both finished. Good selection of beers."}
{"text":"Had always wanted to try this place. Friends from out of town were here and we decided to give it a shot. We were very disappointed in the quality of the food and size of the portions.   The restaurant was quite busy but getting refills or additional drinks was outrageously long. I am crossing this one off my list to take friends to in the future."}
{"text":"Great patio and outdoor area with some fun group games such as giant jenga and ping pong. Service has always been prompt and they have great unique beers to choose from. You'll for sure get the German vibe here just looking at the menu selection and beer choices.   This place is great for all types of people because I've been here with work friends, happy hours, brought my parents here and my wife recently did a surprise birthday lunch here with about 10 of my friends!   I don't have a favorite thing here yet but the pretzel is delicious and they have some really great sauces to go with some of their appetizers.  The place does get pretty packed during your typical peak hours but what good place doesn't in Old Town. I'm looking forward to trying the chef's new spin off Taco Haus. So that should tell you something, the place is successful enough that they are able to spin off a Mexican version of Brat Haus.   Oh and if you're looking for that Oktoberfest any time of the year, you can get das boot filled with your favorite beer. Auf Wiedersehen!"}
{"text":"Alright, so here is my two cents on Brat Haus. I suggest to steer clear of the brats I tried (Beer Brat & Spicy Thai).  I found them a bit dry and bland.  I also found the pretzels less than fabulous. I do suggest to try to big, juicy, tasty, meatballs. Much better choice. The outside patio very cool, an open fresh space with plenty of seating and a big ol' wall of funky art. The service was also friendly, and attentive and fair prices. Overall, it's totally worth checking out if you are in the area and in the mood for something different."}
{"text":"Loved the beer garden and beer selection. The giant Jenga was a blast. Great spot to chill with friends outdoors. A unique spot in Old Town--will be back! Server was very friendly. The ranch was a little heavy on the dill but all the appetizers we had were tasty."}
{"text":"was expecting a very very good dog.  I ordered the pepperjack one per the servers suggestion. It was good but nothing I would come back for. However their desserts were AWESOME! Very nice outdoor seating and jenga to play!"}
{"text":"Yum! Everyone loves a giant salted pretzel from a street vendor or at the movies, right? Well if you try the pretzels at Brat Haus those crummy frozen treats will be forever ruined for you. And for good reason! Here they're soft, smokin' hot, big enough to share with a friend, and they come with a variety of mustards and dips. Including a curried ketchup!  What I loved most here however was that there's no pretension. These guys really know beer, and it's obvious. But it's not thrown in your face and there's no pressure to pretend or act like you know as much as they do if you don't. And if you do know your beers, they're happy to talk shop.  I came for a small tasting session and learned more than I could have ever expected. I also got to try a variety of beers and eat those yummy pretzels in the process. And just like the beer list and the menu, the decor is fabulous too. Walking around the place I spotted a massive outdoor patio perfect for larger groups. I'm not from the area but would love to return and pay them another visit if/when I'm back in town. Definitely a top spot in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We took in the World Cup Final here on Sunday with a few friends.   The beer selection is off the charts. Loved the San Tan Epicenter. We had the Pretzel with Beer Sauce as well, delicious and good to share. Last we had the Haus Brat and the Spicy Brat. Their homemade sauerkraut was off the charts as a topping.   The game was slow but the people and staff were fun and charming. Certainly a place we will be visiting again and again.  Only drawback is the size of the bar area - a little cramped."}
{"text":"Good beer selection and pretty decent choices on the food menu. This place has a huge outdoor patio that's perfect for those spring/summer/fall evenings. The majority of the seating is large communal tables, makes it a little awkward if there's only two of you.   I will be going back to try the brats and the different sliders."}
{"text":"this place is so dam good first off they have this amazing court yard when it gets cooler it will be a grate place to hand out the pretzel and veer beer cheese was the best I ever had the jerk chicken brat was very tasty I like that they have like six different sauce stone mustard and the honey mustard were my favorite the service was slow wasn't the server felt she was the only one and there was like 10 tables definitely be back"}
{"text":"Really cool place! Indoor and outdoor seating. Great atmosphere! Fun, happy people working there - always a plus! To start with there is definitely a beer or soda here for everyone (as long as you drink beer and/or soda)! So many good choices - too many for one visit so plan to go back again and again. That's what we're going to do! We shared the Pig Mac Burger. It was sausage and beef perfection. Along side we got an order of fries and be sure not to miss the Hush Hush sauce! I may get some of that to take with me next time!"}
{"text":"The management here are very unkind and inconsiderate of guests with problems. The servers were quite nice but managers mistreated our group and were VERY unprofessional and swore and insulted our group. DO NOT GIVE THIS PLACE BUSINESS if you have any sense of respect for the industry."}
{"text":"If you like delicious food, this is certainly a place you need to try. I went with a large group and we got a bunch of different appetizers and entrees. Everything was delicious. Our waiter, Macallister, was great. He was always present without being overbearing. The brats were great, the beer was great, the rattlesnake chili was great, and the service was great. If you're in Old Town, you should definitely come here!"}
{"text":"Three beers, two Brats, fries and a pretzel was our order ($50). Everything was mediocre. The beer selection is great and the concept of the place is pretty cool. I would give the food a 3.  Next time I would come here to drink and maybe have a snack, but I would not plan a meal here again.  On a side note, this cost them all stars. Flying a drone around for a half an hour while we ate outside was borderline ridiculous. They were flying this noisy thing over our heads and taking video or photos of us/customers and the restaurant. It instantly made us want to leave and was a bit intrusive for my taste..."}
{"text":"Great pretzels and the lamb Braut was so good could even taste a hint of mint loved it. Great service Victoria, Matt, Ryan, and Erin!"}
{"text":"We've been walkin' past this place for a few months now & kept meaning to come in.Finally made it in for a late 3 p.m. lunch on a Monday. The place was slow, the beer cold & the service good. I'm happy to report they didn't disappoint & even had my local seasonal fave Four Peaks Pumpkin Porter. So get yourself some Brat, pretzel & pumpkin porter before it disappears."}
{"text":"I recommend this place to everyone. unique, delicious, and great service. I wish their was another one closer to my house. Never been let down there and always happy I went."}
{"text":"This is a cool little spot. I was looking for a German restaurant while visiting the area for mlb spring training. At first, I was a little hesitant about this place because I wanted more traditional German food. When we entered the biergarten, we were met with a bunch of sideways looks from all the Giants fans because my group was all Dodger blued up from the shoes up. I'm glad I reserved judgment on this place because the food was alright, and there were some good happy hour specials. We even made friends with a few of the Giants fans too."}
{"text":"Good spot for some German food at a very reasonable price. Cool outdoor beer garden setting with games to play.  The garlic fries were perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The pretzel was great with the accompanying mustard.  I think the curry wurst was good (huge portion) but maybe too much ketchup and not enough city taste.  The bratwurst original is the best out of the sampler."}
{"text":"Yum! What a find. Had the Original Brat and Belgian Fries. Headed back in a bit for a Radler!! Although I hear it will be crowded with locals ready to celebrate Oktoberfest!"}
{"text":"Place has potential. But not being well executed. Food menu could use a few more items, like sides and 1 or 2 healthier dishes. Not everyone wants to just each a brat and bun.  Outside atmosphere is very nice. But service isn't great. Servers aren't tagged or uniformed to know they're servers, and apparently I don't have a dedicated one. So when I want a refill of water, I sit here for 15 minutes wondering who is gonna notice or who I ask. But food was tasty."}
{"text":"Thought the food and drinks were great. Service needs some improvement. Visiting from Chicago. Came here with a big party and wanted to sit outside. Host told us big tables in the shade were reserved. So we sat down in the sun and asked staff to set up their big umbrella. No problem, except for the 2 hours that we were there no one sat at the reserved table. Other minor but cumulative things included our waitress describing the charcuterie board as weird meats when we inquired about the menu item, and wait staff conversations about being understaffed can be heard very easily from the guest bathrooms.  You have the food and beer on lock down. Train your staff on table talk and avoid personal conversations at the server station."}
{"text":"Brat Haus was our choice for tonight while in Scottsdale on our 4 day vacation. We started off with a warm Pretzel and Cheese which was very good. Next, our group ordered Curry Wurst, the Haus Brat and a Beet salad. The food came in a timely manner and the music, although far from authentic, was keeping us entertained. Unfortunately it was quite a slow tonight (Saturday) but the Reissdorf Koelsch K√∂lsch made up for it. The waitress was very friendly and accommodating, and promptly responded to our requests for extra beers and food. The beer garden is an awesome setup and I can imagine this being a very fun place to hang out with a larger group or on a busier night.  Hope to return in the future. Great experience"}
{"text":"This place is great... The decor was interesting with good attention to detail, the servers were friendly and helpful, the food was delicious.  I had a spiced lamb brat and it was enormous--if I had known I would have split it with my partner!  The garlic fries have actual fresh garlic on them, the curry ketchup and truffle aioli are fantastic and the pretzels are great too.  Can't even think of a complaint!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! Amazing brats & fries. Great selection of beers. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Loved their outside patio and ambience.  The brat was delicious.  Loved the beer.  The only thing I didn't like was the cold hard pretzel.  Other than that.  Highly recommend this place for beer and brats.  Great service too."}
{"text":"This place obviously doesn't are about customers.  My food was cold. Ask them to redo my order.  Attitude. Very bad attitude.  Don't waist you're time here !!! They don't care !!!"}
{"text":"I love the Brat Haus! Lets just say I'm not what you would call a brat fan but this place changed me for the better! They use all fresh, natural hormone free ingredients, which makes me feel better about putting it in my body! If you've never been in before I recommend trying a brat. My favorites are the spicy brat with grilled onions or just the simple route with sauerkraut, the chorizo brat topped with the fabulous root beer onions (marinated in root beer) and the Moroccan Lamb brat with apricot onion chutney and spicy bell peppers. They just added a spicy pepper jack brat which is also fabulous! They have tons of brats to choose from besides my favorites I listed above including... a sweet brat, house brat, southwest chicken (spicy!!) a rabbit and hops brat, duck and dates, they even have a rattlesnake brat, and a veil brat. All the brats are made in house and are fresh as can be! The meat for both the brats and burgers come from Niman Ranch which means all the animals were vegetarian fed, antibiotic/hormone free and pastor raised... This can only mean that the meat you are ingesting is of the highest quality possible!   Be sure to start with a pretzel and cheese! They are DELICIOUS and the cheese dip is a three cheese beer dip that u can also top your amazing Belgian fries with but don't forget the bacon. The Belgian fries are to die for (they also have awesome garlic fries)  the fries come with your choice of dipping sauce and they have a ton to choose from... Ranch, chipotle aioli, truffle aioli, thousand island (hush hush sauce)  sriracha aioli and Blue cheese bacon. Okay I hate blue cheese but this blue cheese bacon dipping sauce is AMAZING!!! A must try! So not only do they have awesome dipping sauces for your fries but they also have a variety of mustards to choose from! They have the simple traditional catsup and mustard but they also have a whole grain, Dijon, honey mustard and curry ketchup. Try them all!  Some other note worthy menu options are- The schnitzel, crispy ribs, local tomato salad (add bacon!) and the charcuterie options!   Try and save room for the amazing date cake made with oatmeal stout and root beer (its soooooooo good!) you also can't go wrong with the butterscotch root beer float!   OHH and did I mention they have 28 beers on tap and tons of bottles to choose from? They also have an awesome happy hour!   **side note this is NOT a German food restaurant... But they do celebrate Octoberfest and its a pretty epic party!"}
{"text":"I came here for a group mixer and the staff was amazing.  The bartender (very smart and good looking lady) made it a point to remember every ones name so we wouldn't have to keep telling her what tab to put our next beer on.   She also informed me that this place prides itself on their knowledge of the multiple craft beers they have on tap, so she asked what kind of beer I like and pointed me in the right direction.    I tried the San Tan Brewery's Count Hoppula and it was a very dark IPA that wasn't as bitter as a normal IPA, which I like."}
{"text":"Tad disappointed. A lot of money for some brauts and bad service. Server was a bit stuck up, didn't care for questions. Looked cool but just didn't work out as hoped."}
{"text":"Kind of a cool place with good service, but unfortunately the food just isn't very good.  My chicken platter was completely dried out and no matter what they call it, that wasn't German potato salad.  Wife ordered the lamb sausage which was way overspiced and cooked hard.  On the plus side, the manager dropped by unbidden and graciously replaced her meal with another very quickly when she commented on it.    The atmosphere indoors was OK except for a kind of punky music track that seemed out of place for people trying to enjoy dinner and friends.  Overall, good potential, but only if they learn to cook."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite places! Love everything about it. The cool, casual, ambiance of the indoor seating area is more comfortable and quiet, but still interesting. The outdoor seating (the majority of their seating is outside, I'm pretty sure) area is wonderfully unique. The various Jumbo-sized games scattered around, like Jenga, are SO much fun - even just to passively watch other people play while you're doing your own thing at your table can add such an enjoyable element! The food is great, the pricing's not too bad (especially during happy hour,) and their signature pretzel, served with beer cheese, was an instant favorite for me. I actually have active cravings for this pretzel (& cheese) semi-regularly. Like, at least once a month. And I've only been to Brat Haus maybe 6-7 times, first visit being probably around 2 years ago. I mention this not because I'm proud, I assure you... it just really goes to show how GOOD it is! Seriously. If anything, just stop by and have a pretzel at this place. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Great  beer, friendly service, small menu. Wonderful place to go watch the game! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best Bacon wrapped dates in town. Really good, thick chewy pretzels, great beer selection, attentive wait staff."}
{"text":"So I got some feedback from management, and it seems like I was wrong about the bathroom situation.  I'm glad! It has at least three bathrooms on site.  Our waitress only knew about the one, so that's what I was going on.  And they tell me they also have larger seats, if you ask.  Personally, I wish they'd just look at us and go, \"oh, they'll probably be more comfortable in the larger seats\" without anyone asking.  Who knows to request a bigger seat when they were pretty much all the same size (at least in the room we were in)? What do you say? Two for the fat seats! Large freakin' mammals, party of three! Or perhaps, lead me to the biggest seat in the house! Awkward.... I do appreciate my concerns being addressed, though.  Since they took the time to reply, I am taking time to correct my initial review."}
{"text":"OMG!  This was SUPER yummy!  We were visiting Scottsdale with our kids (11 &14) for spring break .   We asked for our hotel concierge for a family friendly place.  We took his suggestion and took the little golf cart shuttles from our hotel to the Brat Haus.  SO HAPPY!!  We had been there before, years ago, when it was a pizza place (different owners).  The BH made the old parking lot between their two bldgs an awesome outside seating are.  There is tetherball, live size Jenga, corn hole...PLENTY to keep the kiddos and grown up kiddos busy!   On Sunday's they do Brats, Beer, and B movies on a huge outside screen.  Would have loved to see this!!  Next trip.  Now, the food...WOW.  We had several people so we sampled almost everything on the menu.  Everything was fantastic!  Shout out to the root beer onions, the date cake (trust me, try it!!) and the piggy(?) sandwich (pork burger)!  YOU  MUST get the Belgain fries!!  My husband prides himself on being a pork aficionado  and he was blown away by EVERY brat...the beers were awesome too!  20-30 on tap varieties!  if you can't find one you like.. :(  boo hoo for you:(  good thing they have wine, cocktails and non alcoholic beverages!  But OMG, the PRETZELS!!!  YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY!  I wanted to bring them home to freeze!  I haven't had a pretzel that good, EVER, even in Germany!!    The ambiance was casual, fun, welcoming!  The staff attentive and top notch!  Prices were super reasonable and you will be thrilled with the value!  Using the local climate that pleases (until July) it is the perfect venue for almost anything that isn't \"fancy\".  I recommend this for groups, families, celebrations of all kinds.  There were 2 b'day parties, a going away party when we were there.  OOH, and the short bus out front is the cutest sign ever!   TOP family pick of our week!"}
{"text":"Brat Haus, It's been a while but I remember clearly how amazing the staff was!!!  We got to this establishment, very close to closing time and we were still treated very well. I didn't get to eat much here, I just had a drink, a few french fries and about half of a beer brat with the hot peppers ( I gave the other half to my friend, guys will eat just about anything). That was all delicious, and even better with the special treatment as my small group and I enjoyed the fireplace in the back patio along with a fine game of Jenga, we were practically the only one's left by that time.  It was all super swell!! :)  Thanks again Brat Haus, I must come back some chill day to try out that pretzel with queso fundido!! Sounds delish!! :)"}
{"text":"The beer selection and atmosphere was great.  We ordered the board brat and chicken schnitzel.  While they were okay, the schnitzel and the spatzle were bland.  The boar brat was dry, but tasty with the sauce.  We liked this place,but could spice up the food a bit."}
{"text":"Damn was this place good!  I'll take this over the former resident Oreganos (which made me sick) any day!  Beer brat was perfect, and the fries were delish.  We started with a hot pretzel which was tasty as well.  Great selection of beer, and we loved the outdoor ambiance.  Even though we were sitting outside on a chilly January evening (due to a ridiculously large party indoors... the only minus of the night), their many heat lamps kept us warm.  Will definitely be back.  Such a nice change of pace from the typical douchebaggy establishments of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We were here for a birthday party, so we weren't able to get the full effect, but we loved it enough to go back! Their beer selection is great, although some are a little pricey. Those are the more rare beers that they have, but they do have a great variety of everything. The outside misters are a VERY good idea, I love how they are a 360 degree type, never have seen that before. They have mainly community tables as well, which is awesome if you have a big group. They have a giant Jinga game, as well as bags or cornhole as I have heard it be called.   Overall a great place to visit, wish we lived closer to Old Town or else we would be there more often!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Every visit is excellent, every time. This most recent visit was a Sunday lunch on the patio, and even though the food took 40min to arrive, it was so good, any minor irritation or impatience was swiftly forgotten. I ordered the beet salad, comprised of roasted beets, citrus segments, pistachios, and local goat cheese in a delicious vinaigrette. It was light but satisfying, a great mix of textures and flavors. The Belgian fries are always incredible--we always get the large cone with a side of truffle mayo and hush hush sauce(a tangy, creamy sauce, kind of like 1000 Island, but better). Hubby got the venison chorizo brat, which was topped with caramelized onions and pickled carrots--I kept reaching over to steal those veggies off of his plate lol! Bonus: the beer list is great--a perfect mix of authentic German biers, local brews, and a few other good ones(I had Ballast Point Aloha Sculpin with my salad). BratH√§us is an unpretentious, laid back, flat out FUN place to eat, for the whole family."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with Robyn N. and Rand H. the place was nice with lots of friendly staff. I had the pig mac and the rattle snake sausage (python no rattlesnake today) Well the food was ok but not outstanding and I think it was not worth the price. If the order would have come with fries i would have given them another star. Ate there an hour ago and I am hungry already."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a team lunch here yesterday.  Several of us ordered the Brat Burger, which was excellent.  The fries were crispy, which is how I like them.  They have several sauces for you to enjoy with your fries and I'd recommend their Hush Hush and Sriracha Aioli sauces.  They comped a slice of their Drunken Date Cake to us and that was awesome!!!  Service was good and seating was difficult, but we opted to sit \"community style\" at a large table amongst other patrons.  Had fun meeting new people.  Will have to try a brat the next time."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant/brewhouse! I had the polish brat with sauerkraut and red onions. It was fantastic. The fries were excellent  as well."}
{"text":"As a German born girl, I give this place huge props for making amazing sausages! The pretzels with homemade cheese sauce was fantastic... Not like gross goopy nasty cheese product... The French fries so good and the dipping sauces, especially the truffle aioli was to die for. Even if you usually don't like sauerkraut, this is really homemade like my grandmother's! The fact that the sausages come on baguette just like in Europe, is a great touch. The many beers on tap rock! And for dessert... Oh where do I start? The date cake, even though I don't like dates, was fantastic!!! And then then NUTELLA shake.... Oh good lord, amazing!!! The Butterscotch root beer float was so good it has changed my world!!! Looking forward to the weather getting better so we can sit out on their big patio. ....and to all the people that didn't like this place... And no offense, You don't know what you are talking about!"}
{"text":"I had gone to Brat Haus with a group of about 15 people on a Saturday. Obviously it was really hot outside, but the restaurant was still pretty busy & with the number of people we had, I'd definitely say that their service here was on point. Everyone ordered drinks at different times but the food order was put in all together, and everything came out accurately & also all together. They were also great in providing separate checks for everyone making cashing out easy for us.  Unfortunately, the reason why I'm rating this place 3 stars is because of the food. I had gotten the Jerk Chicken Brat with onions and a side of fries & the truffle aioli sauce. The fries were done well and sauce was really good, complimenting the fries well, however for this being a brat place, I was very disappointed with the brat. It was pretty dry and the onions on top tasted weird because they were really sweet. I ate about half the brat but did filch some fries from my neighbor tho! And also, it wasn't just me - I don't think anyone else seemed too impressed with their meals.  I will say that we hung out outside after we were done eating and the patio was definitely the best part of this place. It was a fun casual environment for us to hang out & enjoy some drinks and play games. It was just really disappointing that the food was lacking so much."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Our house brat with sauerkraut and pickled onions on top was delicious!  The French fries were scrumptious, especially with the blue cheese & bacon dip.  Our waitress, Sam, was very attentive and knowledgeable about the food.  We ate in the smaller restaurant area vs. the bar area.  It was warm where we ate, but the feel was cozy."}
{"text":"Love the place.old oregenos location. Get the hot pretzel with assortment of mustards. Lots of good german beers on draft. funny mini bus outside. place will be packed come spring training."}
{"text":"The Brats are tasty and the Sp√§tzle is amazing!!!  Their pretzel appetizer is highly recommended! The slides are yummy as well as the cheese curds. The service was average but maybe because it was our servers 1st night."}
{"text":"If you want a specialty brat, come here!  They have Rabbit, rattlesnake, and regular brats too!  The staff is welcoming, friendly and passionate about what they serve.  That passion translated into the delicious food the served.  The roasted pork was absolutely amazing.  I didn't try the chicken and waffles since my plate was full and I didn't want to take food I wouldn't  be able finish.  I left stuffed full of great food.    The date-cake was mind blowing.  I am not the biggest fan of dates, but this cake completely caught me off guard.  They have a very nice outdoor seating area, there was a fire going and a giant sized Jenga. They also have cornhole outside. A great place to go if you want to get out."}
{"text":"What a nice treat.  We had the spicy brat - loved it and beer brat - really good.  Also tried the fries (soggy) not impressed. And the german potato salad - loved it.  I'm not a beer drinker but, did have one to go with my brat - such a huge selection.  Service was exellent.   We ar looking forward to trying more."}
{"text":"This place is incredible.  Really great service, delicious food and drinks, and the manager even came by to thank us for coming in.  The fries were amazing, the chicken and waffles was amazing, the beers were amazing, the pretzels were amazing ... the only thing that wasn't so amazing was the check at the end of the night, but I'd say it was worth every penny."}
{"text":"Great patio, great food, and great selection of drinks!  The brats, the fries were delicious. I also loved the selection of sauces and mustards which are apparently all made right in house.  And they have a great selection of bottled soft drinks if you're at lunch or don't feel like drinking. Really want something good, try to the fresh squeezed lemonade... it's tart, but delicious!  Brat Haus, you're a great addition to the Valley food scene!"}
{"text":"The bun doesn't do it for, to much bread to taste the brat. Large selection of tasty beers"}
{"text":"My hubby, son, and I came here before the hot air balloon \"show\" a while back. The atmosphere of this place is great and fun.  We sat outside where there were games (Giant Jenga, Corn hole, big carnival game) and ate the sliders, a pretzel, a meal (forgot what my hubby ordered) and the schnitzel kids meal.  We are a sharing family so of course we all shared each other's food. Everything was really good. I even tried all of the sauces on the pretzel & all were really good- including the beyond hot habanero one.  Def recommend this experience."}
{"text":"Service didn't seem to be the strongest suit of Brathaus, at least for my first visit as a party of one.   Originally I was given my choice of seating in the outdoor area, only to be asked to move because I had been led to a spot that had been reserved by a large group. No biggie, I'll just slide over somewhere else. After not getting any attention for upwards of 10 minutes, I headed for a seat at the bar.   The gentleman at the host station ended up taking care of my first beer as an apology for the lack of attention when I was first seated. So points for that.   I have to give Brathaus a lot of credit for an impressive beer list - by no means am I a beer snob, but I appreciate a place that has a number of things I've never tried as well as a good selection of local brews.   The brat slider sampler hit the spot and seemed to be a decent indication of what they offer. I certainly wasn't disappointed with the food, even though it was a limited sampling. The pretzel was also tasty as well as serving as a sponge for my beer intake.   I'm a bit torn on Brathaus because I think the core product is good but there are some hiccups with service and what was brought out. I saw several beers sent back over questions of quality, and while I understand that restaurants are inherently chaotic, this one seemed to show its chaos more than other places I have been. Maybe I caught them between shifts or just a bit off their game, and I'm willing to forgive that because as I mentioned, I think their core product is pretty good.   As they say, you never get a second chance to make a first impression, but I think I'd be willing to give Brathaus another chance. They salvaged a rocky start well, and delivered the goods for which they are known. There's no doubt that it has an appeal, especially for the younger set who want to hang out and hook up in the courtyard once the sun goes down. But for an often single diner in the increasingly competitive Scottsdale and Phoenix metro market, I did leave wondering if it would be a place to which I would return."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for a long time and finally made it over there last Friday.  I was meeting a good friend who is ALWAYS late so I sat down outside and had a beer.  Where can I begin?  Mike and Kevin were great...very attentive and pleasant.  The ambiance is the BOMB, especially since the weather's so nice.  We went to town on brats, belgian fries, and even dessert.  It was all really yummy and definitely an option when going out with friends in the future.  The only thing that would get this place an additional star is putting more fun stuff on the menu!!!"}
{"text":"This is simple:  everything is great, quite authentically German, flipping incomparable pretzels, the service is typically excellent (kind and courteous servers!) and all the brats are fab -- though I highly recommend the Moroccan lamb!     ...(and Matt, the supremely knowledgable bartender, is the person I'd hire if I owned a bar!)...   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Not over the moon... but will definitely be back to see if I just ordered the wrong item on the menu :)"}
{"text":"Came by here on a recent trip to Phoenix and had a very good experience.  The place has a funky feel to it and the staff was very nice.  We came in for an early dinner and sat inside.  Very comfortable.  They have a huge beer selection, I tried the Krombacher Dark and it was very good.  The menu has a lot of options, we had the pulled pork and jerk chicken, both were tasty.  This was a good experience and I would go back."}
{"text":"Best brats in town! Loving the pretzel with all the amazing mustards that go with it :-)"}
{"text":"If I could do 0 stars I would. First of all, they didn't take the order of our entire party. One of the couples with our party didn't get their order until way after we ate. When we were trying to close our tab, we find out that our friends ID was given away to a stranger. We waited around and the management staff did NOT care."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, Bland, nothing special, would not return.  Our family of foodies recently had dinner here, we were excited upon arrival but that quickly turned to disappointment with each course.  We started with 2 orders of the pretzels with 4 dipping sauces, followed by 6 different entrees.  The food was average, nothing to go back for.  Could make a better beer brat in my kitchen with Johnsonville Brats, beer and onions boiling on the stove, then browned over the grill.  Wine and beer selection was good. Employees were friendly.  Too many other restaurants in town to waste a night at the Brat Haus again."}
{"text":"Pretzel and cheese was legit.  All the servers were friendly and accommodating, and the beer list is great.  Some rare Belgian beers you'd only find in the bottle usually.   Def, don't just walk buy and think it's just a gimmick place w the silly half cut VW bus outside its worth a try."}
{"text":"Tasty new addition to the Old Town Scottsdale area. Went on their opening day for lunch, then back again for dinner. They're still working out new-place kinks, but nothing serious.  For lunch I had the spicy brat and sweet peppers. For dinner the chorizo sausage and chutney. You can't go wrong on either the basic or premier sausages, but if you're unsure what to try go for a sweet/spicy combo. Like the spicy brat and a sweet topping, or sweet brat and spicy toping. If you like sauerkraut, it's all homemade (like the sausages) so give it a try. If you don't like sauerkraut, you're a strange person and should probably not go to a bratwurst house. And I feel bad for you. I'm sorry.  Where was I... oh yes, their belgian fries are great, and I am a fan of the sriracha aoli dipping sauce. Of course, they pretty much had me at \"sriracha\".   Their beer list is very well rounded. I'm not a huge fan of belgians and german beer, so was a little worried, but there is plenty of great beer there to drink across the whole spectrum. Chatted up Ben The Beer Baron for a while, and he definitely knows his stuff. Don't be shy about asking him for recommendations."}
{"text":"Brat haus is set up great. The big patio with the big tables makes it comfortable and great for a large party. I went to Brat Haus for a friend's birthday who is a beer fanatic; it was perfect in that sense. The server asked perfect questions to know exactly what kind of beer we would like, and made great recommendations. The food to me was so-so. I like sausage just fine, I just wasn't a huge fan of the toppings. I ordered the brat sliders, which came with a sample of 3 brat's with 3 different toppings. I was disappointed. The saving grace for Brat Haus in my eyes was their hot pretzels with cheese (AMAZING), beer and the \"hush hush sauce.\" I also ate a few French fries whom a friend had ordered and they were good. I'd highly recommend this place for a casual dinner, birthday party, or for someone who loves German beer. The prices are great too!"}
{"text":"After finally finding out where to sit... I had the BratHaus burger and it was pretty damn good. That's all I need to say.."}
{"text":"This location is close to my house and has become part of my dining out rotation. I have also used them for a corporate work event. Fantastic, friendly owners. Food is simple, but hits the spot. Beer selection never disappoints. The only feedback I have is the buns on the brats are a bit dry. I tend to not eat the buns anyways so not too much of an opportunity in my eyes. Outdoor atmosphere is enjoyable during nice weather!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place since it opened, and I finally got around to it this week. Now I'm mad I waited so long!  I have tried many veggie burgers in my life, and I think I may have found \"the one.\" It was so tasty and did a great job staying together. The dressed arugula and pickles on top complimented the burger just so. Usually I find myself drowning veggie burgers in condiments and cheese, but this was great as is. Of course, I had to ask for extra pickles because I'm an unrelenting addict. My husband really liked his gigantic haus brat and loooooved the german potato salad. I also got a small order of fries so I could try out all the condiments kept in the 6-pack cartons on the table. The house made curry ketchup is out of this world good. It was hard to stop stuffing my face. Although this place focuses on beer, the cocktail list is great too. The new fashioned and kentucky mule were delicious and very strong. We like a place that doesn't skimp on the booze!  I look forward to coming back so I can try the pretzels and date cake."}
{"text":"My first impression was of the outdoor patio.  I really really like the patio!  I've only been to Germany once, so I'm no expert, but it really did remind me of a few Biergartens I've seen.    Since it's Oktoberfest season, they had a really good line up of draft German beers.  I had the Spaten Oktoberfest and my partner had the Bayerischer Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan Wei√übier (clearly he's a complex person lol).  Reasonably priced @ $5 a glass made it totally worth it to splurge into the foreign beers.    I had the Hausbrat with Sauerkraut and Relish, adding Curry sauce to it they had sitting at the table.   Amazing Brat and very delicious.  Not traditionally presented, as the bun was much shorter than the brat, and more of a potato bread roll than a Brat Bun, it was still very good and I appreciated the lesser amount of carbs.    The only feedback I'd give is that when we were served they forgot the silverware, napkins and condiments.  The visits from the waitress was few and far between so we were a bit worried after she scurried off that we'd have to go on adventure to drum something up.  The manager was very observant however, and saw the look on our faces and got us all squared away quickly.    We will be back!"}
{"text":"The brats & fries were good, very fresh and an excellent selection. The many flavor varieties was a welcome change up.  The service was spot on and our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu, making helpful suggestions.  The atmosphere was hip. We ate outside in the courtyard and except for some awkwardness sitting at the high-top table/bench combos, it was great. The smell from the smokehouse gets your mouth watering and the food was ready super fast.  I will come here again, and I suggest trying it out if you've never been."}
{"text":"I reeeeaaaallly wanted to love this place. Maybe my expectations were just too high.  We went last night, it was quiet and our server was VERY ATTENTIVE. Which was a little much-there was at least one time that he reminded himself that he already asked us the same question, and he even would wait to watch my husband try his beer. Which, of course, I know is better than the alternative, but seriously he could've gave us a little space.   The brats were great but smallish portions. We got fries-good, and a salad-meh. The spinach salad was sold out, so we got the cobb and it was just so-so.  I guess I feel like overall the concept is giving mixed messages:  -brat haus is all about brats! no wait-beer! the name of the restaurant features food-brats specifically, but then the menu says they created the food to complement beer. The menu doesn't pair up food specifically with beer. It felt like it would be a good place known for drinking (like casey moores), but features a menu that reads like it's a restaurant.  -brat haus is relaxed and casual like a German oktoberfest but has small portions and nickles and dimes the customers. Obviously, this is a Scottsdale restaurant, but why not just adjust the prices and include a choice of side? You go in expecting a BRAT, but you get a brat swimming in a bun. You get one topping, but are charged 75 cents for each additional. Ching ching ching. You realize you need to order fries. Or a (meh) salad. Look, just up the prices and portions so people feel like they are getting fed, otherwise people are just going to keep being disappointed. I even heard people at the next table getting a big explanation about how blah blah blah the each additional dipping sauce...that kind of stuff doesn't make a great dining experience.  I am pretty sure I will try this place again, but I am going to give it a few months and let them work the kinks out."}
{"text":"They place looks awesome, however, the staff completely ruined my experience.  They were very rude to us as we were waiting for a bike crawl in the back parking lot.  We immediately left before getting drinks."}
{"text":"A group of us comes to Scottsdale every year for Spring Training and were we ever pleased to discover Brat Haus. In fact, we ate there five times in seven days. The staff is phenomenal, as is the beer. The food which ranges from foot long sausages to vegan fare is outstanding. We took all of our friends and everyone loved it. The beer selection is out of this world. They also have a ping-pong table and giant Jenga game. There is indoor and outdoor seating. If you're in Scottsdale this is place is a must."}
{"text":"Was just walking my dog around old town around 3 on a wed. when a friend text to meet up for a drink, I yelped \"dog friendly\" and ended up at Brat Haus, where the staff (everyone I connected with), the atmosphere (beautiful patio w/ beer hall picnic tables), and the happy hour on spaten were all tremendous.  A great addition to Scottsdale, I'll be back w/ more amigos to be sure.  Thx much - ps can't wait to try the food, under specialties was a tri-tip sandwich w/ my name all over it"}
{"text":"I love this place. The standard brat is great but their creative stuff is out of this world. I love the lamb and goat brat with curry relish. The service was first rate. Friendly, helpful without being invasive, polished, and the thing I value the most - the courage and confidence to make recommendations. I'll add it to my rotation."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Brat Haus was definitely not what we expected it to be. The hype was more than what it really is. We were suggested to try the sampler which basically was 3 sausages with 3 different toppings No bun which wasn't mentioned in the menu or by the server after knowing it was our first time. The beer was warm and they charge you for everything if they can charge you for water they would. Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"Food was 4 stars, service was 2-3.  Went to lunch on a weekday, the bar side was about half full (or empty for you pessimists) and a friend and I went for a quick lunch.  Service was friendly, but absent. Long waits between drink refills, we asked for a to-go box twice, and never got it. Found the box myself so we could get out.  It's a beautiful little spot, with very good food. I just think they need to work out some service kinks. In time I am sure they can make the service as great as the food and location."}
{"text":"The food was good but the entire bar smelt like it was cleaned with a dirty mop.  Not a pleasant experience"}
{"text":"great food, really expensive. 2342342343 different types of beers, but you can only afford to drink them during happy hour!! staff was awesome and friendly, food was even more awesome than the staff"}
{"text":"Might be the worst pretzels this side of whatever river runs through Germany. I nearly had to send my free pretzel back to the kitchen, but we had a bigger controversy with the cheese cup. At the YELP event, free pretzel coupons were handed out and normally a pretzel automatically comes with cheese, but in this case if you order a pretzel it is $5 and with cheese $6. Now if you just wanted a side cup of cheese it is $2.50. Yeah, your pricing needs some updating and a reality check, so waitress tried charging me the $2.50, instead of just a buck for the cheese. After I resisted, she decided to just take the cheese off the bill, so I won that battle. They have added non German beers, but the taps taste funny and my Oatmeal stout tasted off. The outdoor area is still a good place to chill, but the indoor bar smelled musty and perhaps the funniest moment ever was when some college kid came wandering in and said he left his ID here a few weeks ago. They still had it stashed away, now they just need to learn how to make a pretzel. These guys were not able to make tacos (RIP Taco Haus), so a bad pretzel I suppose was too be expected. The ones at the YELP event were hideous."}
{"text":"Great food, beer and ambiance. Really modern twist on German. Only problem was the slow service ( waiter was really sweet tho)  Received the wrong sausage-ordered the regular but they brought spicy. Didn't see our waiter again for a long while so we were stuck with it  Potato salad was very good as well"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great atmosphere and staff is very knowledgable about their beer, unfortunately not a lot of options for vegetarians on the food menu but other than that would recommend"}
{"text":"Great service, beer selection, and cozy atmosphere.  Avoid the pretzels and house brats.  Maybe i got an old pretzel but quality control is badly needed there.  Bratwurst was way too modern and did not taste good.  Stick with traditional German food and i will come back."}
{"text":"This place is the shiznit!  They full on blitz you with great vibes and good times.  The patio is my favorite in old town:  huge trees provide shade during the day and have lights woven inside the branches to create a great glow at night .  An awesome covered area with a neato mister system called the misto360 is the bomb.com  For food the fundio: which is two fresh baled pretzels and a cheese dipping sauce makes me scream in delight.   Awesome beer selection with activies such as ping pong, bags, tether ball (jamned fingers sold separately) bags and jinga round out the experience.  They also have a rotating mural from local artists in the patio!"}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere! It is really fun to come here with friends and play giant jenga, cornhole, or ping pong. They have a great selection of beer and have daily specials. Their pretzels are really soft and delicious."}
{"text":"Braut Haus has done a great job of transforming the old Oregano's parking court into a laid back, shady beer garden filled with picnic tables, tether ball, ping pong and corn hole games.    The ambiance is casual and not too raucous - a good antidote to some of the high octane bars up the street.  Filled with a non-trendy, mixed-age crowd, the BH seems more akin to a downtown Phx joint - vaguely but unoppressively hipster.  The menu sounded enticing but overall the food was a bit lackluster. I ordered  charcuterie plates of goat cheese, sliced pears and pee pollen, and a cheddarwurst brat.  My boyfriend had a burger. All the food was dry - even the pears.  Prices are reasonable however servings are small.  The service was perfect - friendly, attentive, efficient: an A+.    Brat Haus provides an outdoor eating/drinking experience different from other downtown Scottsdale restaurants and bars. I'll be back to give the food another shot."}
{"text":"Well today was not a good day. Once we got there the manager greeted us and said to sit where you like. So we did near the jenga board about 10 min later a table of three sat and another 10 min after that another table of 2 sat both got service and we were still waiting..... so I went inside to ask for a beer menu bartender looked irritated with something, without saying a word handed me one then left. I waited 5 min didn't then went back to my table and we debated about another 5 or so min to leave or not, not seeing anyone who worked there, we left. Another table left with us said they were there about 10-15 min before us and no service either...... what's going on?! Idk not at all good for business no matter how many times your on tv or how good you \"WERE\" doing. Just a thought from a local chef who frequently comes here.... I should state that this is not the 1st, 2nd or the 4th time this has now happened my last 5 or so visits here which is why I am posting this low score."}
{"text":"Less then thrilled with the brats, beer was good, but brats...not so much. If you have the word brat in the name of your restaurant, you really need to make the best brats and they just did not live up to the restaurants name"}
{"text":"Delicious and happening! Review for Brat Haus Oktoberfest event. I was so fortunate to win 5 tickets to Brat Haus' September 17th Oktoberfest event at the Yelp Pawfect Day Event at Paws Commons. Thank you, Hailey B.!. I rustled friends and went to the event. We got there at around 5 pm after doing a little shopping in Old Town Scottsdale. The shops there are super charming.  Tip: While some stations accepted credit card, doing Oktoberfest is much smoother with cash. We walked over to Walgreen's and got some Greenbacks. After reading up on the Brat Haus on Yelp, I decided to try the HEFEWEISSBIER which had a nice wheat flavor. Very drinkable!  I loved my grilled das brat, a footlong bratwurst served in a pretzel bun. It was amazing with their house dijon mustard and sauerkraut. I also enjoyed the gouda soft pretzel with beer cheese sauce. I wanted dessert but had absolutely no room left.  For entertainment, we enjoyed the fellow Oktoberfest revelers. We witnessed the brat eating contest and left around the Badass Beard Contest. We could barely see the contestants for the Lederhosen and Dirndl Contests. It was crowded and festive. Our servers were friendly and welcoming. We were lucky to purchase the last Das Brat. I have to think about coming in costume next year (free admission)."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to hang in old Town scottsdale. Great beer selection along with cool vibes."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE!  The concept of this place is awesome, and so is the food! I think once the weather cools off it will become a regular place we stop by on nights out. First of all I thought that the two restaurants side by side and the back area with tables/chairs and decor was a cool concept. Also the prices were very reasonable, and the service was good too, seemed like a happy staff that wanted you to enjoy your time. We went on the launch of Oktoberfest and it was great... maybe because I love seeing guys dressed up in liederhosen, or maybe because the two man german band was so cool. Very traditional & they made us dance!   Here's the scoop on food + drink:   + San Tan Beers + Waffle Fries  + Beet Salad + Spicy Brat + Apple Strudel   We left happy and I got a picture next to the awesome Brat Haus van parked outside (coming soon, I'll add it to the photos).   We did eat outside even though it hadn't quite cooled off yet, but when I went inside it looked pretty awesome so we'll have to check that out next time. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nice outdoor patio for enjoying the AZ winter!  Great waiter; very helpful and friendly. If you like German and European beers this is the place to come because they have a great selection!  We had a pretzel appetizer which was great. Also tried the Brats which were uniquely favored (ever had a brat with chorizo?) and tasty. However the hot wings were so-so and too hot to eat. This was probably my fault for ordering wings at a German themed restaurant!  I'd definitely come back here though. Great place for happy hours."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great, homemade brats!  Everything they serve(except for the bread) is made in house which is cool.  They have a great beer selection.  Nice open, patio area out back!"}
{"text":"Who would have thought, a (beer) garden in a desert?! Well, we found one, and we were very pleased.  Set back off Scottsdale Road among the few trees and twinkly lights, and a really large Mexican mural, are a handful of tables, high tops and long picnic tables for guests. Considering the location of Brat Haus, I think they did a reasonable job in setting the scene.  As far as the food & drink go, you can expect regular german fare like brats, pretzels, potato salad, etc... and a wide variety of beer. My man had the hefeweisen, recommended by our sweet server, and the bartender was able to make me a radler - beer and lemonade mixed together! Splendid!  To start we ordered the house-made pretzel that came with yummy sauces. While we waited for our rounds of food we played with the giant Jenga game they had - so much fun! After we snacked on the soft, yet crunchy pretzel our mains arrived. I had the house brat and my man had the moroccan brat, both were juicy and flavorful. We both got the root beer onions as toppings. The onions were extremely sweet, so much that I couldn't finish mine. Next time I would just go with the sauerkraut.  Overall, a lovely and refreshing experience."}
{"text":"I rolled into town late one Sunday night and they were nice enough to keep the kitchen open for me after closing time. Had a great brat with some terrific beer. Their beer selection is amazing."}
{"text":"We lucked  into this spot, through a magazine article on new places in Scottsdale, and then a little quesioning of locals.   We talked the waiter into creating a \"sausage sampler\" with all nine of their unique, fresh-made sausages. the result was better than we could have ever hoped for."}
{"text":"We went for lunch after an event in Old Town. There was a wait but I truly feel it was because everywhere else was slammed. The food was awful, the service was substandard (I feel the waitress was just not experienced but she was friendly). Our appetizers came out with the meal and that was 45 minutes after we ordered. Unfortunately the food didn't taste good at all. I wouldn't recommend this place and will never return. Too bad it was terrible bc the outside seating was great."}
{"text":"Brat Haus is so cute! Sit on the patio (ample picnic bench seating), enjoy the beautiful Phoenix weather, drink a big beer, place bar games, and have fun!   The food is fine. We got the pretzels & cheese fondue, which was pretty good. The pretzels came out really fast so they are clearly prepared well ahead of time, which is reflected in the texture (harder and tougher than the soft pillow homemade pretzel I was hoping for) but the cheese sauce far & away makes up for that! It's awesome, enough said. There are a few vegetarian options, but not a lot which is probably to be expected from a menu that says \"swine dining\". I had the shaved raw salad and enjoyed it.  I highly recommend visiting the Brat Haus for some beer & fun. It really is a great outdoor patio to relax at."}
{"text":"So we've been to Brat Haus a couple times before and have always had a great experience. Tonight the service was off...it took us roughly 5 Min of waiting for a hostess to show up and when we received our appetizer we were sorely disappointed. We expected the usual hot, crispy cheese curds and what did we get...soft, cold turds. We will see how our sausages turn out....hopefully they are warm!"}
{"text":"Scottsdale is not one of my frequent dining destinations partly because of the distance and my budget but also because of the parking situation. But Brat Haus turned out to be a pleasant surprise: lots of parking at the back, and the food is excellent and reasonably priced. I also loved the very friendly service and the spacious patio area. The menu lists several tempting items that have pretty much made it certain that I will be returning.  That that patio is also dog friendly means that when my bestie comes over to visit and brings his dog with him - which is always - this is definitely the place for us to go and have a great meal."}
{"text":"This is quite possibly the best lunch experience I've had in 5 years! I travel a lot and this place is tops! House brat - superb! Great wait staff! Friendly atmosphere, superior beer selection! What more could you ask for!? Nutella pretzel dessert is tops! Great experience!"}
{"text":"I look for opportunities to be in central Scottsdale so I can visit this great stop.  Having been to beer gardens in Bavaria, I can appreciate this great little place.  Sitting in the back on the benches, with the shade of the tree and the meat smoker in the back - Joy.    1 star for wide beer selection 1 star for great German food 1/2 star for the pretzels 1 star for the creative touches, such as new bratwurst flavors.   1/2 star for the great biergarten feel in back."}
{"text":"This is a pretty awesome place. Everything I've had has been spot-on and they're really creative with their menu. I've never had a lamb brat before, but it worked! They have lots of interesting toppings to choose from, their pretzels are tasty and their fries are cooked to perfection. The cherry on top is their awesome beer list, and they're served in their specific branded glass!"}
{"text":"Only reason Brat Haus didn't get 4 stars is simply that beer and brats is not really my cup of tea. However, the atmosphere was great! Really intimate, small setting...dark wood, old world charm, which is only made better with an incredibly friendly staff.   Started out with the fresh made pretzel, which was wonderful (very pleased with the 6 condiment options that are brought with it). I ordered the Moroccan Lamb sausage with Apricot Onion Chutney topping. The sausage was spicier than I had expected, but good flavor. The French roll it was served on was fine, however, the bread to meat ratio highly favored the bread, which was a little disappointing. The Belgian Fries were delicious. I ordered the Truffle Aioli dip to accompany them, however, it tasted pretty much like mayonnaise. I preferred to use the table side Curry Ketchup instead...that was sweet and delicious!"}
{"text":"awesome clean brew house .. great friendly staff from the poor girl outside in this HOT HELLISH Az sun who managed to have this perfect smile  to the gents who greeted Us at the door, that's a great first impression ... out door seating in the Spring will be great , we opted for the bar, great choice here, considering the Staff was will gifted with What was on the menu , and offered great suggestions right out of the shoot !    love the feel cool open vibe that this place has going on , list of beers on the wall was impressive , great selections , puts you in the mood for a iced cold bier ( beer)   Then the menu , oh boy , even if there were a few choices , that's all you need right there... one spicy brat with kraut . one chorizo with pickled red onions,PICKLED with lots of care in mind.   then the Heavens opened !

You WILL See me back there in no doubt , and the hundreds that WILL see my Social net friends"}
{"text":"I feel badly writing this review because my waitress was helpful and very friendly. However, everything else was terrible. The haus brat tastes mostly like dried oregano. The beet salad was very oily and bitter, with way too many wheat berries. The beets were tasteless, which is sad because they're my favorite vegetable.   The misters were way too wet and leaky, leaving puddles on our table, food, and drinks    The waitress removed the salad from my bill, but that is not enough to make me go back."}
{"text":"Love the pretzels and mustards.  Brats are great too.  Lots of great beers.  I'm looking forward to the brat taco stand they're opening soon onsite."}
{"text":"bartender was excellent. me and my boyfriend arent really drinkers, my boyfriend actually called ahead of time because we were trying to track down my new favorite drink, bubble up, which is a soda that we got from a jazz spot in scottsdale a couple of nights before. they had it, we drank a couple there and got two to go. the bar was cool, the service was good and it wasn't super loud like most bars can be."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I'm not a beer drinker but they have a ton of beers on tap or bottled, as well as a delicious bottled butterscotch root beer. Their fries are amazing, and the brats are great too. The buns really hold everything together well."}
{"text":"After 3 trips to Brat Haus, I finally feel good about reviewing it.  Here is the breakdown:   The Good:   1. Service- Every time we went there it was busy and we received very good service and our servers were knowledgeable about the beer.  Speaking of beer:  2. Beer- Hands down best beer selection in Old Town! They also make a killer Moscow Mule =)  3. Belgiun Fries- Come on, trice fried fries... how can you go wrong! I also love all their sauce options.   4. The atmosphere- Perfect spot in Old Town, especially now that it is cooling down.  I also love the graffiti mural on the wall, the owner said they will be randomly having local artist paint the wall. Great idea!   The forgettable:   1. Pretzel - its okay, nothing special, I was expecting it to knock my socks off... they stayed on!  2. Vegan- While I am very grateful of them having a vegan option, it was tasty but very hard to eat because it kept falling apart... they need to work on making a vegan brat!   My friends love this place, so we'll be back for sure.  One day I'm going to try their nutella shake... or steal their giant container of Nutella... Mmmmm!"}
{"text":"Ate at the Brat Haus today for the first time and had the pepper jack brat and the fried chicken, so delicious! In addition had really great service! I will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"I was there with a large group. They handle 40 of us well. Drink and apps were great and fast. Atmosphere was loose and relaxed outdoors. Honestly all I had was appetizers but it very good."}
{"text":"I love this place, maybe it was because the stars lined up perfectly or something.  We were hanging out with one of my favorite couples, we had a wonderful server, Matt, and the night was really great, though a little chilly for my Phoenician taste, lol.  I had a couple of flights of beer, Matt suggested them, since I am not an experienced beer drinker, he was spot on.  I loved them all.  We also had the schnitzel sliders, wow, they were awesome.  The pretzel was great, although we agreed that next time we should have shared.  We tried a couple of the sausages, I had a bite of each since I was so stuffed from everything else.  The lamb and the chorizo sausages are winners, again, those were great recommendations.  I can't wait to come back and try some other goodies."}
{"text":"I had two issues with this place: 1. Gluten 2. Service  I have a gluten allergy and Brat Haus has a ton of items on their menu marked gluten free, so I thought it would be a good place to go. I called ahead to make sure they could accommodate such an allergy and they said yes. When I got there, I informed the waitress of my allergy. Her disinterested response should have been my first sign, but I guess I didn't catch. I was sick before I left the restaurant.  So, here's the problems with their \"gluten free\" menu. First, fried items that are labelled gluten free on the menu share a fryer with non-gluten free items and as such are not gluten free. So, I feel their menu is inaccurate. But I asked that question beforehand and avoided the fried food. Second, since I must have caught some cross-contamination, it's clear that no accommodations were made. It's not hard: change your gloves and use a clean set of utensils. If Five Guys can make it work, Brat Haus should be able to (or if not, don't say you can and throw GF on half your menu items).  Here's the problem I had with service. Perhaps it's obvious by now, but I was not a fan of our server. Even outside of the gluten issue, she was bad. She just coiuldn't have cared less about serving us. But you get a bad server every now and again and I can typically overlook that. My real issue was that the manager completely blew me off when I told him that I had got sick from the gluten cross-contamination. He literally interacted with me for less than 5 seconds before walking away and the tiny response that he did give me was a complete blow off.  Really disappointing. Food seems pretty good otherwise."}
{"text":"Maybe it was an off night?  This is the worst review I have given.  It is my Son's 26th birthday today so we met up with him at Brat Haus.  I had a really good feeling about this place due to it's current star rating on Yelp and the way it is designed.  It  has a really cool vibe.  The service and food were not acceptable.  The Scottsdale market demands good food and this place is not making the cut. My son ordered a Chorizo Dog and he sent it back (no flavor). My wife and I split a burger and they did not ask how I wanted it cooked. The burger arrived and it was well done and the only flavor I could taste in it was a strong taste of pepper?  It was horrible, I am sure they cook it to death because the quality of the beef won't allow them to cook it on the rare side.  I did not drink but we had plenty of beer lovers at the table who were ready to have a beer or two but they had a hard time getting a server to stop by and take their order.    I tried some of the other's food and the only thing I found to be tasty was the pretzel fundido.  Not sure I will try Brat Haus again."}
{"text":"Went in with high hopes. The space is really cool.  Lots of buildings, cool patio area, industrial scale Jenga games, a granite ping pong table with a  chain-mail net...what's not to love?  The servers were friendly and attentive.  Started with drinks - butterscotch root beer?  What?  It turned out to be pretty much like root beer, but with a butterscotch finish.  Not bad!  The hot pretzel appetizer was ok - rather tough, but the beer-cheese dip (with green onions?) was tasty.  I got the fire brat - supposed to be jalape√±o, habanero and brat.  It was pretty mild, and...for a place called Brat Haus, not particularly special.  The sauerkraut was a little flat, and there was just too much bun on the sandwich...next time, maybe the brat plate so I can focus on the brat more.  The fries were pretty good (and curry ketchup was a nice touch - one of 6 condiment options, IIRC - ketchup, yellow mustard, curry ketchup, dijon mustard, whole grain mustard, and honey mustard).  Probably worth checking out again, but didn't live up to my expectation on the brat."}
{"text":"This place. The atmosphere, totally on top of it, personable wait staff, smoker cooking, quality beer list, AMAZING playlist by Riley and custom made bar games fun, makes this a place I would stay all day long. I can't get sick of Brat Haus, and just when you think you've tried it all, they make new additions that are authentic and worthwhile. This place should keep doing its thing exactly how they are doing it forever.  If you have a group of people or just one or two, that wants to relax on the patio, it's almost like being in your own home, but a much better version of your home. People come and go and everyone is having a good time, how could they not?!"}
{"text":"Do you love beer in all its intricacies? Are you a man in need of some bro-to-bro time? Do you wish Oktoberfest could be a year round celebration?  If you answered yes to the above, then today is your lucky day son! BRAT HAUS is a bro time + beer time experience which equals a MAN CAVE MECCA!    I came here with a few Yelp co-workers for a Beer 101 class to learn all about this alcoholic beverage fermented using the sugars from cereal grain. (That little nugget is straight from my handout yessireeee!) You could tell our host was passionate about beer and spoke about it as such. The men in our group were mesmerized. As he discussed the brewing process I wished that my boyfriend was with us because this is something HE'D find fascinating. Like sports and cars, I like beer, I like to consume it, but I don't have an innate need to study it. It would be like talking to a straight man about the intricacies of womens shoes and why a platform shoe helps to elongate the length of  womans leg yet the added height helps to create comfort when walking. If you're a man, I lost you at the word \"platform.\" But despite the waning of my overall attention I did appreciate our teacher's passion and depth of knowledge.   More so I appreciated the three different kinds of beer we sampled and the GIGANTIC bavarian pretzels with dipping cheese. They were lovely and I wanted to tie one around my neck with a string for a snack. We sat inside during our class but I would have loved the outside patio as well. It's got loads of picnic tables with colorful triangle flags strewn through the air. One last thing I must mention is that the restaurant is very well maintained and immaculately clean. Big props to Payton Curry for being a smooooth operator! (Fist bump)  31 Yelps Review Challenge: #2/31"}
{"text":"I always enjoy going to Brat Haus. The atmosphere is fun and it is a great place to hang out on a patio with friends. They have an extensive beer selection and a number of great tasting brats. We had their giant pretzel and French fries. I have had better pretzels elsewhere but it wasn't bad. The server was a bit slow but to be fair, we were a big group and it was close to closing time. Be sure to try their more exotic brats, such as the wild boar or venison!"}
{"text":"We hoped this would be so much better. Pretzel overcooked and cheese was flavor less should have been a sharp cheese rather than super mild concoction. (What an obvious miss). Braut bun was way to bready and did not fit the contour of the best and had no good texture or flavor. The chili had little flavor but the best itself was kinda  good except for skin a little tough and a bit bland. The fries were overcooked but the truffle aioli was amazing. The beer was outrageously high at $10 plus tax and tip ($13????) Which was brought in a mildly cool bottle and warm glass -- note they were out of a $7 bottle and offered this as a sub w/o telling $ difference. The final bill was outrageously high. All four of us felt easily would never return. Not. Even. A. Close. Call. The end. :("}
{"text":"Tonight was actually our second night at the Brat Haus - the first time we went for a few beers, a game of washers, and to try the bavarian pretzels - they were absolutely delicious that night  so we decided to go back...and soon.  We had a very different experience tonight.  After being seated we waited for 10-15 minutes before a server greeted us - he said that he would figure out who our server was but took our beer order.  When our server arrived she didn't apologize, nor did she introduce herself, she dropped off our beers, quickly took our order and was off.  It was another 45-50 minutes before our food arrived.  My husband ordered a beer brat, something he grew up with in Wisconsin and has made himself time to time.  He said that it was peppery and had no beer flavor and he didn't enjoy it at all.  He made better beer brats himself last weekend and the man is no chef!  I had ordered the vegan grain sausage and what I was presented with was a soft veggie burger.  I was a little confused but ate it anyway, it was rather bland and the \"burger\" part of it not at all crisp.  I was really excited for my \"fake brat\" so that was a disappointment and, frankly, should be listed under the burger section if that is the \"sausage\".  We ordered the fries as well which were ok - we would have loved to get them a little earlier if we'd known it was going to take so long to prepare our meals.  After dinner we had another round of beers and ordered another pretzel - this time, the pretzel we received was rock hard and not at all enjoyable to eat.  We had asked for honey mustard and curry ketchup and received honey on the plate.  After 2 hours we had finally paid our bill and walked quickly away from a bad dining experience.  The only positive thing I can say about this place at this point is that the beer is decent, but it's not the only place in Phoenix with decent beer.  I'm not sure what was going on with this place tonight, but I hope they figure things out.  This is exactly the kind of concept of a place we would go to regularly but after tonight my husband said he won't go back."}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to check out this new neighborhood eatery in Old Town... We were there on the second night it was open which led to service quality issues, but that's to be expected initially.   We were seated at a large wood community table, with another party at the other end. I'm not a huge fan of this type of seating, but it wasn't bad. However, there was major confusion regarding table numbers for food delivery (for all of the patio) and discriminating which party had ordered what at the community table. I assume they will work out the kinks with this pretty soon because with a smaller menu chances are high the the party next to you ordered similar items and will end up with your food.   We had the chefs feature brat, this month from Justin Beckett, topped with root beer onions (highly recommend) and it was phenomenal! Best I have ever had! The fresh, soft bun was even a delight! The beer brat was also good, nice tart sauerkraut. Belgian fries were fantastic. Dipping sauces we chose were lackluster, we had the blue cheese and bacon as well as the thousand island, can't remember what they called it, skip both and try something else. Beet salad was also just o.k., very sweet. I had heard they had a bean salad at the soft opening that was fabulous and was looking forward to that, but it didn't make it onto the menu, yet. We ordered a pretzel with our meal as well, it did not arrive until 40 minutes after our dinner did. It was really very good. It was delivered without the food runner offering mustard, as they have 5 different varieties, for dipping, but we managed to flag another server down eventually to get them for us. The drunken date cake was maybe one of the best deserts I've tried in a long time! The portion was ample, perfect for sharing. The cake was incredibly moist, topped with a sweet caramel (?) glaze and served with a side of whipped cream adding just enough cool tartness to cut the sweet. It was perfect.   They did a good job with the decor, you definitely don't feel like you are on the patio of the old Oregano's, it's industrial, yet warm. I'm gonna give them a few weeks to get their legs underneath them before I give it another shot. Has the potential to be fabulous if they can iron out service."}
{"text":"I leek the feel of this place especially in the patio area. It's comfortable and very social as it's festival \"bench seating\" style but you must be seated by a greeter which is not a problem. the staff is very nice knowledgeable about the food they sell and the beer they serve. I Love to stop by in the day time and enjoy non-crowded parking which is the only issue I have with the location. \"limited parking\". My impression of what makes this place keep going is the local workers in the area and that they can walk to this after work without the parking hassle (do you get that I'm not happy with the parking yet?)  Anyway, to the  food, I love brat sausages. These were really good. I was impressed with the chorizo brat? the unusual side condiments are fun.   Today I ordered the \"das brat\" with sauerkraut and was disappointed that  I was served cold sauerkraut and had to send it back to have them heat it up (without hassle I might ad) and they brought it back warmed up nicely. It was fantastic!"}
{"text":"A real fun and interesting concept, has tons of games in their beer garden to keep you entertained. Very good selection of beers also"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, patio, food and company! It was a great evening. Also, the pretzel with beer sauce was killer. I have an affinity for fresh baked pretzels and this was savory as well as sweet. I'd return just to have one to go."}
{"text":"Unique and fun new place in Scottsdale! Took the whole family recently and there was something for everyone! There are actually 2 separate buildings to Brat Haus. One side is clearly \"the bar\" and the other side is more geared toward those (like us) who come with kids!   There was an outstanding selection of beers from all shapes, sizes, and thicknesses. There was also an outstanding selection of uniquely flavored soda pops for the kids too! We enjoyed pretzels fundido and the Belgian fries for appetizer. Although the pretzels were a bit overdone and fundido was a bit blah, the Belgian fries were DELISH and plentiful. The dipping sauces were excellent and more than made up for the lack-luster pretzel appetizer.  I enjoyed the Spicy Brat with the Apricot chutney and it was the perfect blend of sweet and spicy. My son and his friend enjoyed standard beer brats with mustard and saurkraut. They LOVED them. My husband enjoyed the specialty pork brat and was very pleased with it as well.   I'm looking forward to going back for a grown-ups night out there soon as I'm sure it's way more fun for the adults though I am happy that it was kid-friendly as well! Well worth the 40 minute drive from our house and looking forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"First time here! Bartender was awesome! Super friendly and accommodating! My fianc√© and I enjoyed the night. They have games if you decide to dine at the patio. You have to try their pretzel, it is amazing. I would  be back."}
{"text":"First time visiting this place. Quite the spread - two separate buildings (Brat Haus and Bru Haus) with a patio between the two. limited indoor seating but good outdoor patio space. They get real creative with sausages and apps. Need to come back and try more. On this visit, had the deviled eggs, which weren't bad, actually. The fried pickles were okay but have had better in Midwestern bars. They have 28 craft beers on tap, so it's a great place to grab a brew. Try the 'Brat and Beer Flight' to get a good flavor of both. We also had the Sonoran Hot Dog (pretty yummy) with beans and jalapenos, and the foot long Brat (huge) with kraut and relish (also very yummy) washed down with a Hefewizen. Monday is All Day Happy Hour day. Worth a second visit someday!"}
{"text":"My server was great, packaging up my meal and running my card for me when I mentioned I was short on time. Very fresh and tasty passion fruit tea. I'm not much of a fry person but these were above average. Hush hush sauce was good touch. I was disappointed in the bacon slider. The bacon party had so many other things mixed into it that I could not taste bacon. I would be willing to try again but order differently."}
{"text":"Grew up in Germany and saw this place on Yelp. Decided to try it while I was in Tempe for training. I was torn between the schnitzel and Currywurst. I don't get Currywurst very often, so that was what I ordered. Sat inside the bar area. The bartender had excellent customer service skills. Made me feel like I was a regular (it was obvious there were many regulars and I could see why). Currywurst was pretty good. Although I'm a bit partial cuz nothing beats going to any downtown city in Germany and ordering Currywurst from a stand. It was good though... I also ordered the Nutella cheesecake to go; it was awesome! It's a shame I don't drink beer cuz they had an extensive list of beer on draft. Location was nice... Downtown Scottsdale right next door to another bar. They have outdoor seating that makes you feel like you're in a beer tent in Germany. I'm back in town next week, and I'll be sure to come back to try the schnitzel!"}
{"text":"We saw all the high ratings, and gave it a try.  We thought it was more of a German Restaurant-Pub. It turned out to be a bar, with very uncomfortable seating and some \"German\" themed foods.  Both me and my Stepdad were very disappointed.  My food has no seasoning, tasted gross  and was cold.   There was no salt or pepper anywhere  to be seen,  and the overworked bartender was serving all the alcohol in the place, while trying but failing,  to provide service to those eating in the bar area.  The so-called German potato salad was fingerling potatoes, cabbage, bacon bits and mustard seed, without any dressing or flavor other than the heavy smoke of the bacon, that I could detect.  I couldn't get the over-smoked bacon taste out of my mouth for hours.  The food is way overpriced for what you get.  My Stepdad tried to talk to the bartender about the four German draft beers on thier list, and was pretty much blown off, if not insulted.  He was told one beer he mentioned wasn't even a German beer, in no uncertain terms with a snotty tone.  The bartender was more in a hurry to get back to talking to his tatooed twenty-something pals sitting at his bar, than to welcome us or help us select a beer.   The food took a very, very long time to come out, and I had to take my card up to the bar to finally get  a check and get the heck out of there.  We were never asked how we liked the beer or the food.  I have no idea what some see it this place.  To me it was lousy food, lousy service, with an arrogant attitude and very uncomfortable.  We haven't enjoyed a meal less in a very long time."}
{"text":"This is a neat place with a lot of outdoor as well as indoor space.  I like the volume of the music, the decor's cool, and the beer selection is pretty good.  However, they're also one of the ones that serve the beer closer to the \"ideal temperature\" for tasting.  Let it warm to that, its not like we're sitting there chugging them I say!  Anyway, the brats I've tried so far are decent.  For me though sausage doesn't veer too much on the good or bad side, maybe because its always just been a flavoring agent for bread, pasta, etc.  The bread is actually really good here.  So why the 3?  I may be biased like I said but the brats I've tried so far (rabbit, sweet, spicy, regular) isn't that great or bad.  The toppings are neat and flavorful.  The 6 different sauces they have are 6 different sauces..  I kind of like the curry ketchup ok but the others is just not that good to me.  The sauerkraut is a lil bland.  The garlic fries were limp and not very garlicky.  The pretzel was really good!  The beer cheese was a bit.. lumpy?  Grainy?  Not cheesy enough for my taste I suppose, and slightly on the stingy side - I mean they charge like 3 bucks for it separately, can I at least get a full 1/2 cup??  Which brings me to the final bit - prices are a little high when you don't go for specials or during happy hour.  Still a bit high then.."}
{"text":"I enjoy the staff they are super friendly!  I love the food I'm  half German they've got it down now when they 1st opened it was not this good     Oh by the way the gluten free beer is amazing"}
{"text":"I wouldn't call this an authentic German restaurant but it was definitely up to par with brats, sauce and beer. It's more of a trendy Scottsdale restaurant than a German eatery."}
{"text":"This place is great!  The space is amazing...separate dining room, bar and huge outdoor beer garden/patio.  Looks like a great place to spend a Saturday or Sunday drinking beer and watching football!  The service was quick and friendly and the food was good...other than the pretzel - too dry and overcooked.  The sweet brat with sauerkraut was really tasty and they make their own mustard in - house = yummy!  The beer selection is pretty extensive too...pretty much something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Had lunch at the Brat Haus today. The food was good, but the service was terrible and they were not busy. I had the spicy brat with the sauted rootbeer onions. The fries are fresh and they have a lot of dipping sauces to choose from. This is outdoor patio eating, so I would not come here on a hot day. They do have some outdoor games that kept my kids entertained as it took 30 minutes to whip up 4 brats, fries, a salad and a kids grilled cheese.   There are a lot of other options out there to choose from that don't take this long."}
{"text":"My son and I came here about 4- 5 years ago, and we have had a couple trips to Phoenix since and make sure we get here every time.  While the service can be a little casual, it is very friendly, and it is such a comfortable place to hang out and have an incredible brat, root beer or beer, and pretzel. We even talked about opening a Brat Haus in our hometown, but we don't think Beaverton people will like a dog in the way they should."}
{"text":"It was mine and my wife's first visit and I really, REALLY, wanted to love this place. After all I am Austrian and love this type of food. Alas, that's not the case. While the food was good the service was horrible. Our server took our order and never came back to our table. Very grateful for the host as he got us refills, to go boxes and our check. I very rarely don't tip, as I have been a server, but when you don't work the table you don't get a tip. Because of the host we will be back and hopefully the service will be on point.  As a PS if I had cash I would have tipped the host!"}
{"text":"I debated whether or not to write anything about Brat Haus, because I'm a non-drinker who came for a Beer 101 class (just... don't overthink it) but in the end I gotta give these guys mad props.  Before we go any further, let me just say this: pretzels. Big, doughy, salty pretzels that come with several different kinds of mustard. Yessir. Yes, daddy. Yes, Aunt Ida's gimpy dog Dot. Pretzels. I ate my fair share, and several others' as well. Pretzels. And fundido cheese. YES.  As drinks go, they've got a massive spread of beer and the fella who taught the class knows more about beer than anyone I've met before. They don't do domestics (no Miller Lite here, kids) just interesting stuff.  I should also mention that as a non-drinker these guys totally get mad love from me for the extensive line of old school soda that they had on hand. Mad love. I would have been happy with a Sprite, but I got to order an old red cola. They also have their own sodas - ginger beer, cucumber mint, and a strawberry thyme something or other. Thanks!"}
{"text":"This place is a nice, mellow place to kick back at. Despite it being 103 degrees outside, my wife and I decided to sit outside under the misters and it felt fine, at least to me. The food and service was great. This is a great place to hang out with friends. We tried a couple of other places nearby but they were just too packed and way too loud for what we needed at the time.  I'd definitely recommend stopping in if you're looking for a mellow place to kick back at and get a bite to eat and have a drink if you're not in party mode at the moment because you're already partied out."}
{"text":"Wednesday evening at 6PM.  I could see the two cooks, the two waitresses and the other two customers in the Brat Haus. Walked out after 15 minutes. Could not get service.  Water was brought to the table and the waitress never came back.  It is a shame because I was looking forward to this place."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good! Our beers were delicious and the whole outdoor atmosphere was amazing! Big groups, small groups, cute dogs and they're very own music. It was just such a great environment. We ordered the pretzel to eat which wasn't as good as we hoped but it was so big deal. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite meals on my 10 day trip to AZ and NM. I'm not really a beer person but loved the huge selection and appropriate glassware. They let us have a taste of a new brew on a slow Fri. afternoon at happy hour. HH got you a good choice of beers for $3 and $4, plus we had a card for a free pretzel and I loved it. No need for the cheese sauce ($3) with all the excellent mustards they serve. And I thought the spicy brat w/ root beer onions was great. Not dry at all, I liked the roll too which lots of people seem to quibble with. Maybe being in the hot sun and having a couple crappy snacks at the State Fair colored my view but I loved Brat Haus. And they served a yummy huckleberry lemonade at the Old Town farmer's market Sat. morning."}
{"text":"I really want give this place more stars, but being that we went there for bratwurst and didn't enjoy the bratwurst, I went with 3 stars.   Pros!  I loved the outdoor atmosphere.  The pretzel with cheese dip was great!  The french fries were really good with the chipotle aioli, jalape√±o ketchup, and regular ketchup.  Cons.....Both of us were disappointed with the bratwurst.  The flavors were strange and they were incredibly dry!  We went with very high hopes and it fell way short."}
{"text":"Nice place for good food and good brew.  Loved the beer, the sampler brat, and the environment.  It's mostly outdoors and the service was great.  Loved the waitress, she was personable, funny, and took the time to make sure we were taken care of.  We were there for spring training and the cold beer just ended the day perfectly.  Nice place for quick, quality food."}
{"text":"I used too love this place, was the best Schnitzel I've had since Bavaria- but I went last night & my favorite dish had been changed!! The pork was over fried the cabbage on plate looked decorated like French restaurant -the gravy wasn't the same replaced with brown water. The sauerkraut was also different And my pretzel was hard as a rock....Bring back the old recipes! Cause I love the beer & atmosphere!"}
{"text":"What a cool place! Casual fun atmosphere. They have a beautiful patio with games and a great beer selection. The actually have a few beers that are hard to come by so drink up while you're there.   The food is simple yet tasty.  I had the curry dish (forget the name) but I enjoyed it very much. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I am giving Brat Haus five stars on the overall expiernce. I get a good feeling everytime I see that outdoor patio which pretty much equals happiness to me especially when you combine it with a great beer. This place is built for spring-time and late fall in Arizona with all the outdoor amenities and patio vibe. The food is good, I would probably give the food four stars. They are currently on local dines which is a plus."}
{"text":"Really liked this place a lot. I stopped in here with a friend while roaming around Old Town Scottsdale and having dinner at RnR. I wish I'd come here and skipped RnR! This place has friendly bartenders, a great beer list (with some really good Belgians on tap!), and really yummy Belgian fries with some of the best sauces you will ever have. My boyfriend enjoyed the 32 oz boot that you can order a beer in. We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I happen to love this place. I have been here quite a few times, and each time, the seating outside is lovely, with or without kids. In the evenings they have a couple of lovely older gents in their lederhosen playing oom pah pah polka music.  As for the -food-: This week, I had the \"exotic'especial- a turducken brat, which was turkey duck and chicken.I thought it was a bit dry, but tasty. Their potato salad[ with bacon and sauerkraut, no mayo], is usually amazing, but this time it was -very- dry and with a -very- strong vinegar taste/aroma.Something about it was not quite right, but I can't pin it down.  They used to have a duck brat that was delicious, and their lamb one is the bomb too.  Hubby enjoys the huuuuuuuuge beer selection, I was very happy they had my favorite Sofie[ though they were down to the last one, and I had to switch to delerium].  it was a bit loud due to a hen night, and ginormous penis shaped balloons added to the ambiance =)  We will be back, because the food is usually very good."}
{"text":"I will warn right off, I may be slightly biased in my opinion of this place, because of my incredibly pleasant first visit here. Is that such a bad thing though?  When I first arrived and seated myself at the bar, I was surprised to find that there were 3 people seated at the bar who I knew. Then lo and behold, I knew the bartender as well! Naturally, this resulted in a rather warm greeting and an instant level of comfort.  Next up was to get a good look at the beer list, which I had already heard many positive things about, despite this place only having been open for a couple of weeks. I must admit, their selection is rather impressive; unfortunately, it is Scottsdale prices. This means that each beer has been marked up a few dollars extra on top of your typical bar prices. It's not enough to steer me away from the place, but enough to elicit a bit of a cringe when the bill arrives. I ended up having a couple of very delicious German and Belgian beers, a couple of which I had (amazingly) never had before.  Finally, the thing that thie place is named and known for: their bratwurst. I was a little unsure what all they could do with bratwurst to make an entire restaurant concept out of it. Well let me tell you, they pulled it off brilliantly. I had a DUCK bratwurst and I was not in the least disappointed. A friend of mine also had a \"rabbit & hops\" bratwurst which he claimed was tasty. At some point I want to go back and give the rattlesnake bratwurst a shot. That selection is certainly enough to keep the curious coming back! I just need to save up a few dollars to cover the cost of the beers..."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night with my partner. Solid and friendly greeting.  We sat at the bar. Fun and informed staff. Mgr checked in on food taste. Had kosher beef and beer brat pls small fries and potato salad.  All tasty. Bun seemed a little large for the dogs. Dogs could be a little bigger but price was right. Beer was cold and fresh. Had German hefeweiss in brewery glassware. Nice touch. Will return. Hope they carve a niche for themselves. Would go back for the beer daily if I could"}
{"text":"Visited on the second day of service. While the Belgian imports were ostensibly overpriced, the German imports were reasonably priced; that's what I stuck to. I enjoyed the fact that there are a couple different outbuildings that Brat Haus is divided into, and the bar was fun, if not a bit too cozy.  The food was excellent. I was particularly impressed with their aioli dips for their Belgian fries. The truffle aioli was amazing, as was the Sriracha aioli. I ordered the Rattlesnake Ripper and a hearth-baked pretzel. The sausage was incredible; not too gamy but it was obvious that it was rattlesnake. The apricot chutney was equally delicious. What got me was the pickles. Normally, I loathe pickles, but I found myself wanting more of their house-made product. The servers were obviously busy, and I cannot fault them for that on their second day of business, but it seemed as though receiving the food took quite a bit longer than normal; there were many tables without food when I arrived.  I sincerely hope this establishment does well, as I intend to be back. I imagine after a few weeks the kinks will be ironed out and things will run much more smoothly."}
{"text":"We love this place! Great food and a nice selection of beers. Even, just the pretzels are worth the trip. Alway a must stop when we are in town. How about that bug/bus!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Very cool little place with great concept. Choice of beers wasn't to bad."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place. The food is incredible the beer selection never disappoints and they have a rotating selection as well. My favorite thing about the Brat Haus though is the service. We are always treated very well. We did a private party for 22 people and paid the extra $20/ person for the all you can drink option. Well worth it. Also, everything is locally sourced and even the mustards are made from scratch. Try the Pig Mac. Incredible."}
{"text":"Last night my fianc√© and I came to Brat Haus to grab a quick dinner (we were at an event at Goldwater Brewing next door, and just wanted to leave quickly for food). We've been to Brat Haus before and really liked the food, so we were excited to have that option so close.  Our food was delicious - my fianc√© got the Bavarian Pretzel and the Grilled Chicken Wings, and I got the Haus Sausage will dill relish, and onions & peppers. I love that kind of food, and really enjoyed mine! We also had beer, and I always think that Brat Haus has a good beer menu with lots of choices.  I did only give this restaurant three stars because of the service. It took a very long time to get our food (too long for the simple items we ordered), and we did see other tables who had ordered after us get their food first. I'm not sure what was going on, but it would have been nice if our waitress stopped by to let us know, or tell us that our food would be out soon, something...but she seemed to disappear at that point and stop checking in on us. We really needed water, too.   Overall, I would still come back to this restaurant for the yummy food, but I would hope to get better service in the future :) they may have just been busy, but I don't think there's ever a good reason to wait so long for food."}
{"text":"Go for the beer try the pretzel. Go else where for dinner. They do average and below average well!"}
{"text":"The five of us (including one dog) got dinner here tonight and were pretty satisfied. Being very German, I can confidently say that this is very American German food. The flipped Hofbra√ºhaus logo that they use for their Brat Haus emblem is apt, as they have flipped some classics, such as potato salad and brat wurst.  The boar, pepperjack, and ha√ºs brats were good, but not spectacular - a bit dry, really. The dork burger was really good, especially with a fried egg added on top, and the Schnitzel sub was about a 4/5. The butcher's plate was good, but nothing special, same with most of the toppings, with the exception of the rootbeer onions, which were really awesome and would put the right brat over the top, if paired correctly.   Good luck with that, though, as the server we had wasn't really any help with any selection; it seemed as if she had only just read the menu (or was new). Drinks were great - beers of a great variety as well as a soda and the \"adult style\" nutella shake. The dog loved her brat, but it doesn't take much to please a hound. We got the nutella desert to share, but it didn't live up to any great expectation.   Atmosphere was fine, but we were unhappy that our server had to come back at least three times to tell us something we had ordered was no longer available (including the yelp chili offer, the boot, the veal brat, and the butterscotch rootbeer). Overall a pleasant place, but very expensive, especially since the brats and sandwiches came with nothing else - no fries or anything (except the potato salad, which was a steal at $3.50)."}
{"text":"I love beer. I don't really like brats though, so my view on the food might be skewed. I went with a large group, and was able to try the rattlesnake, duck, rabbit and lamb brats.  The duck was my fav, but none of them are my thing I guess. I'd come back to drink, but prob not to eat."}
{"text":"Service here has really gone down the crapper. The past two times here, maybe August and December 2016 service has been incredibly slow, and they haven't got half the items on the menu.  Really enjoyed this place when we first started coming here, now I guess it's time to find a new Saturday afternoon lunch spot."}
{"text":"I love this place, eaten here two days In a row. The Belgian fries are fantastic....however, the servers were a bit unorganized, went through 3 people before I could even get a water. Other than that, great food, polite waiters."}
{"text":"Great food, one of the best beer lists in old town and great atmosphere! They turned the lot into a beer garden which is amazing when weather permits.  Blt sliders are amazing must try. Beer is all served in brewery specific glasses nice touch. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Brat Haus is a great little German joint with an awesome outdoor space and a plethora of delicious beer! We stopped in on a cool night, so we sat indoors, but if you're there in the summer time or when it's warm, definitely aim for the patio! There's often live entertainment, games and a very social atmosphere out there.  We tried the Rattlesnake chili (free with check in!) and one of the pretzels with beer cheese. The apps were great, and the chili has a smokey kick that as a southern, BBQ-loving girl, I totally appreciate! The spicy brat with peppers was HOT, as expected and hoped for, and made me even more grateful for the tall, cold beer I enjoyed with it!   This place is ideal for getting together with friends (lots of group seating outside), or for a quick bite before a movie or stroll through old town with your significant other. I can't wait to come back for the dog-friendly Sunday night special!"}
{"text":"We dropped in for lunch about a week ago with some pretty high expectations. On first sight it was a great spot and it was exceptional to see that the parking spots in the center of the compound gone and replaced with tables. The tables did seem a bit sparce and I imagine they will add more as outdoor volume dictates. The new mural was very cool, but the guy who painted it must have been stoned, in a good way though. The place was busy mid week for a late lunch and that was a great sign that all was going well with this new concept, because so many of downtown restaurants would have been empty this time of day. Greetings were friendly as expected, but service was just a tad off, probably just because they are still new, I imagine and expect it to get better with some time. On to the food, The brats- SUBLIME!!!! amazing and I was sad I could only eat one. The Pretzle was abosolutly the very BEST I have ever had anywhere. this is a great start to something great.  What I didnt like was you had to choose add ons like toppings and sauces and that could add up fast if you feel ike sampling. Thats also where the missteps started to happen, The root beer onions must have been from the bottom of the batch cause they were way to soft, reminded me of the texture of over cooked angel hair pasta. The Hush Hush Sauce was SO SO and the Siracha Aioili was just thin and flavorless. The fries were just ok so the sauces didnt save them. The small smattering of pickled veggies just seemed chintzie and a little on the soft side. Will I be back to the Brat Haus... You Bet!!! This place has so much potential, and I cant wait to grab a table on the patio and drink beer, lots of beer, and wash the beer down with brats and pretzles. I also hope my negetive food observations change as I expect they will.  You need to give this place a try, It's a great new addition to Old Town!!!"}
{"text":"A $12 Brat with chutney should have a salad and fries included ...for that price. I even ordered without the bun.  We spent a $40 spot and that didnot include beer, I was hungry when I left.   We were under the impression it was a German restaurant...NOT!   Does urban mean vibe mean: \" little portions for big bucks\" ?   I can BUY a package of brats at the store for a couple bucks, and lettuce and potatoes cost pennies...  Unless restaurants give me my $ worth, I will never return."}
{"text":"The restaurant environment itself was really amazing. My husband and I wanted to get a dessert to split and figured we'd try the CBD brownie. It is NOT worth it. It's roughly the size of half of a little Debbie brownie snack and tastes like a poorly made protein bar. Thankfully the management agreed to take it off of the tab which we really appreciated and honestly was a determining factor in us coming back. But as a heads up; don't get the brownie. Everything else was amazing!"}
{"text":"I did not try any food here, so I can't comment on that. I was happy with the beer options here. This place has a great atmosphere! There is a very large outdoor area with plenty of seating. There are also games like corn hole and giant jenga outside. This is the perfect place to hang out with some friends and enjoy some tasty craft beer!"}
{"text":"Great selection of beer, a simple menu with options out of the ordinary, and excellent service.  Can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Amazing home-made sausage and toppings! The rootbeer onions were flavorful, but not too sugary and sweet. The sausage/brats were great, even though I'm not a sausage fan. I ate the whole thing. I had to sit at a communal table which, actually, I didn't mind. Ended up chatting with a nice couple about food and other good restaurants in the valley to check out. The server we had was cheerful and nice. Quick service too. The beer selection is quite nice! This place is small, but divided into 2 dining areas... a bit odd, but it works. I think they use the patio between the two buildings as a beer garden in good weather. Can't wait for that!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were very excited about the idea of exotic brats, so we went last month. Over all disapointing. We had the chorizo and Morrocan brats, overpriced at $8 with No Fries, extra $4, very limited menu and no wine offered  for Happy Hour reductions. Not everybody drinks hand crafted beers. I agree with Howard Seftel, stay to the traditional $6 brat. Good luck with the concept of a $10 brat with fries. Not a place i would rush back to!"}
{"text":"I had family coming in from out of town and we needed some casual dinning. The Brat Haus turned out to be the perfect place. The food was very good. We loved the brats as well as the beer flight. We had brats, burgers and a salad; all were very good. My suggestion, go on the weekend and maybe you will get Veronica as your server. She was great even thou they were very busy and understaff the day we were there. I highly recommend the Brat Haus casual comfort food with a great atmosphere. Oh, and dogs eat free on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Great place for brats and other German fare in downtown Scottsdale. Friendly staff. Try the currywurst."}
{"text":"Love this place! Service is great, food is amazing. We always have our girls night here. Cheap food and drinks and everything tastes great. Very casual. Has outside and inside seating. Great for large groups or small."}
{"text":"Nothing like a weenier and a beer to get your weekend started right!   Met some friends at the Brat Haus to try the new place out.... and it was great! I liked it because it was different... brats, fries & beer! What more could you want! Oh yeah - home made pretzels! Everything was delicious!   I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a laid-back, chilled atmosphere with great food and beer of course!"}
{"text":"Great food and beer menu. Giant pretzel was great appetizer for our party of 6. Waitress was SLOWWWW, took her time and never went out of her way. Restaurant was NOT busy at all, shouldn't have taken that long."}
{"text":"I've been to the Brat Haus a couple of times. It has so much potential but I'm going to have to pass the next time I'm in the area.  The patio is a great feature. They have some excellent beer as well. I think their brats are good and I like the bun that they come on. But $7.50 for a brat with a la cart sides is pretty expensive in my book. I had the German Potato Salad for $3.75 and the ratio of potatoes to sauerkraut on the plate was about 10 to 1 in favor of the sauerkraut. While I can certainly appreciate a restaurant wanting to jazz up an old standard dish. I think the Brat Haus strucked out on this one. German Potato Salad should have a lot of potatoes in it, dunkoff. The dish was good, but don't call it German Potato Salad. My bad for not reading the menu and assuming that German Potato Salad mainly consisted of  potatoes. I also had the ice cream float which I thought was a complete waste of 5 bucks.   Another factor which puts my rating in the 3 star zone is that our server was so busy trying to upsell that she didn't deliver the \"German Potato Salad\" with the Brat. She forgot to put the correct order into the kitchen so I was basically done with my brat by the time the side was delivered. To her credit, she admitted to her goof up.  One suggestion that I would make is that the Brat Haus create individual plates for the roasted pig. I think you would sell a lot of those roasted pig plates."}
{"text":"3 stars because the food was literally amazing.  The pretzel was home made and I still dream about it at night.  The dunkel was crisp.  The homemade brat was exquisite.  I usually try to give 5 star reviews..  BUT-  Our waitress;  She was sweet at first..  But halfway through our meal, she literally forgot we were there.  We waited about 40 minutes for our check as we watched her walk around to other tables.  It was in the middle of the week so it wasn't that busy, we even made eye contact with her a couple times.  I ended up having to go up to the terminal and ask for our check..  Not cool.  Definitley come here if you want amazing food.  Just be prepared to be forgotten about."}
{"text":"Oregano's decided to move from their classic old town location just up the road to the old Sugar Daddy's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sugar-daddys-scottsdale) which I didn't approve of because they are trading in their cool ambiance for a chain like atmosphere #superweak especially cause ambiance is what got them where they are at today.  Anyway Brat Haus took over the old Oregano's spot which in itself is fantastic because they are already winning at that location, the patio is still huge and there are still several indoor dining areas that have been remodeled but still feel homey and comfortable.  They have a huge on tap beer selection and a nice menu of crazy brat options, for example the exotic section has rattlesnake and duck brats which I'm intrigued by but I'd rather play it safe.  Speaking of play it safe I DIDN'T, I look the waitress's recommendation of the Thai Chicken brat which was shockingly delicious and flavorful, service was quick and on point, the waitress was nice, attentive and attractive +1"}
{"text":"Brauts: YAY! Beer selection: YAY! Most of the menu: YAY!  Fingerling potatoes in the German potato salad: Not so much yay. This is a great restaurant and I've tried many things on their menu and have loved all... with one exception.  The German potato salad with fingerling potatoes would be the bomb if it weren't for the occasional bits of hard grit. I get that fingerling potatoes are very small and hard to clean. Totally do.  It would take hours to scrub the grit off of those things one at a time, but until you can find a way to do that, you just shouldn't serve them. It's a shame because the flavor of the two bites I ate was very good. Maybe it was one batch that didn't get the scrub attention needed, but it was enough to turn me off of the potato salad.  Still... the rest of the menu is enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"The Fries Need Work! I have been here several times now and the fries have been a disappointment . They are not the crispy fluffy potatoey goodness that Belgian fries are supposed to be.  Having said that, everything else from the brats to the beer to the service is worth the trip.  The outside patio is like being at a German Biergarten without all the kitch.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Great place and atmosphere. Friendly staff and I highly recommend the kilbasa sausage dish. Awesome!!"}
{"text":"So the food is good, but a little pricey. The beer is great, but they have all these lame boot and stein purchase options. Why can't I just drink from a glass boot? Our service was awful. Appetizers came before our beers, and my friend had to ask 3 times where her lemonade was. The waitress did comp us a few items due to the slow service, but I would much rather get the items in proper order and quickly than deal with hassle. Don't think we'll go back."}
{"text":"Wife and I were able to stop by, and try a few things. We had their chicken and waffles, they were OK! I kept on saying to my wife, man I have had this before. chicken reminded me of another time!! Finally hour in a half later, it struck me!!! Chicken tasted just like Swanson frozen tv dinner!!! I grew up on that! So you can take that any way you want! You need to eat the pretzels with no salt. Comes with way to much! The pretzels rolls were probably the best dinner rolls I have ever had. Since I was driving, it was a no beer night! Would like to come back and try some brats and beer. Outdoor patio is the best, on cool nights they have a great fire pit! Plenty of room, Until next time and a second visit!  Later,"}
{"text":"I've had two great experiences at Brat Haus. The first was a lunch with some coworkers to scope out the place for a corporate event. We had a great lunch and our server was very knowledgeable about the beer selection and what kinds of beers would pair well with what brats. She also recommended the pretzel with cheese which was amazing. Who doesn't love a good soft pretzel?  Gluten haters, for shame!!  My second experience there was for our corporate event. We reserved the patio which is such a great area. They have giant jenga, ping pong, and darts, as well as large overhead heaters and big benches which were very conducive to our guests mingling and moving and having a great time. Kevin, the manager, was awesome and on top of everything. He made sure our party was well staffed with servers, busers, and food runners. He also made sure that the appetizers came out in waves so as our guests were showing up there were always enough munchies. Once everyone arrived our servers started taking orders from our set menu and as people decided they were ready to eat the servers were always prepared to take their dinner order. Once again dinner came out in waves and it was perfect. Everyone mingled, ate, and drank at their leisure. I could not have picked a more perfect and well prepared place for our event. I will definitely be going back there and recommend we do more events at the Brat Haus."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with some friends on a recommendation.  Was a great experience.  Though I am not a beer drinker, I know what a great beer selection looks like.  Brat Haus had an incredible selection of choices.  It is safe to say that you will find exactly what you are looking for.  They even serve the beer you select in its own personally crafted and labeled glass for that brand.  It was quite impressive.   The food was great.  Loved the home made sausages.  Like the beers, the selections were great.  Grilled and served on a flavorful, fresh and large bun, the sausages were excellent.  And, the condiment choices from a spicy dijon to a thick, full flavored whole grain mustard to their zingy curry ketchup were also very tasty.  You can sit inside or outside in a wide open patio.  The ambience is relaxed and casual.  Really loved this place, the food, and the service.  I will be back.  You need to check it out!!"}
{"text":"This was a very good place to come with a big group. We were visiting from out of town, in town for a horse show, and saw this place on Yelp. It looked appealing and lived up to the stars! Everyone in our party was happy - and that can be hard to manage! Since it was me making the recommendation to eat here, I was hugely relieved.   Loved the atmosphere, loved the beer and LOVED the food. The sausages were served on really tasty rolls, not too bready or hard to eat. A selection of tempting condiments were provided. The curry catsup was out of this world.  I personally had the lamb sausage with apricot chutney, and it was truly stellar. My partner had schnitzel sliders. A little dry, but really tasty. The Belgian fries were also a treat.  We'll definitely come back here when we're in Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"Great brats, great beer selection, and great staff. What really stood out the most though was the flavor profile of the brats. I ordered the Greek brat and was blown away by how complex and lovely the flavors were. You can add additional toppings, but Im glad I went with the bartenders recommendation of just apricot chutney. I honestly could have just ate the sausage by itself and been just fine. I could have eaten three of them if I didnt have other places to try! The bun it comes on is really big. Like they use a mini hoagie bun instead of a regular hot dog bun. Its a good idea, especially when they load a bunch of stuff on it, but I didnt end up eating all of the bun anyways. The apricot chutney was sweet but not too sweet. Almost like a sweet relish but not at all dilly. They have a great rotating lineup of draft craft beers. There's a good variety of all sorts.   Either way, you wont be disappointed in what this place offers."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! A fantastic open patio with heaters, for the cold Arizona nights. A nice small bar atmosphere with 2 HD TV's for your viewing pleasure. The Craft beer selection is amazing, great for the person that enjoys A variety of craft brew! Their Happy Hour is one of the best in the area. 2 bucks off their craft brews and a great deal on appetizer eats. All in all, The Brat Haus is one to put on your list. Whether your in AZ visiting or a local. You're sure to miss out if you don't check out this German style pub and eatery...  p.s. They offer top not service! - Check it out"}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place! I have been here a few times with co-workers for lunch and they have great food, good beer, friendly staff and owner! We have also used them for a event and they came through with quality food and service and we are looking forward to using them again!"}
{"text":"Came in with my kids, clean and modern looking location.  Large German pub menu selection, with wide and varied beer and soda selection.  We each went for a Brat - Duck, Turkey, Lamb - all were excellent.  Kids loved it  The only ding I would give - SERVICE WAS SLOW.  I will be back and would recommend to others!"}
{"text":"Who knew that you get a beer garden to work in Scottsdale...and in June!  While the interior is somewhat cramped the patio is a perfect social gathering spot.  The menu offers a German take on the 'farm to table' concept.  There isn't one item that blows one away but there are several solid options that will complement your evening."}
{"text":"We went to Brat Haus cause of news coverage showing that they were offering FREE Pretzel & Beer Cheese with an order of Beer & Brat for National Pretzel Day!! We were in!! I've never been here so it was a great excuse to check it out! What a darling place! Super Cute patio atmosphere with lots of seating and entertainment to be had outdoors! The food was great! I wasn't expecting so many options in the menu. The chose the sweet and my fianc√© went with the Polish! Both were delicious...far beyond the ones you get at the grocery store! Lots of homemade condiments like onion jam, pickled onions and others made in house! Handmade pretzels!! The service was welcoming and courteous! All in all a great place for meeting a group or someone special for a casual hotdog outside!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Just fine.  Good beer selection, excellent giant pretzels with queso, and decent sausages.  Sauerkraut was tasty and pickles fresh, maybe house made?  I was expecting the brats to be a little more special.  Ok seasoning and juiciness, just not anything special.  This is a nice casual place to kick back in a relaxed  atmosphere and spend some time with friends or watching a ballgame. Pretty good experience."}
{"text":"Awesome place. It's set up like a little village with several different buildings for dinner, lunch, bar, outdoor seating. I stopped by in the middle of the day on a weekday and sat at the bar in the \"bar\" building. Love the many brat selections (the name says it all) on the menu and a huge beer selection, very cool outdoor smoker that makes the whole space smell delicious.   The bartender was super friendly and helpful with drink suggestions. The daytime manager spent some time chatting with me and gave my several suggestions of places to see while I was visiting in town, as well as coffee spots for me to use for interviewing potential hires.   Can't wait to come back when I'm in town next!"}
{"text":"A bit disappointed in this place.  The beer selection is really good, I am a beer drinker but really did not find anything I liked on the menu.    The food was ok but not outstanding. I the spicy brat with kraut and peppers.  No real spice, the kraut was bland and the peppers had little flavor. I would not likely come back to this place if I was back visiting."}
{"text":"Good food but horrible service. Long beer list. Try the Belgian fries with truffle aioli. Good sauces. Pepper jack brat was good."}
{"text":"Had the pepper jack brat with garlic fries and Patato salad! Everthing about the food and condiments was delicious... I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Brat Haus two weeks ago and have already been back with friends.  The food is excellent, especially the spicy brat with sauerkraut and French fries with your choice of 5 dipping sauces.  Fun, casual atmosphere.  The only reason I did not give this five stars is because the service while not horrible could use a little improvement."}
{"text":"Grew up in Germany and was hoping for a little taste of Europe and with amazing reviews I excepted so much more. Unfortunately the food wasn't good. The giant pretzel was the best part of the meal and it was good. I got the schnitzel and it was over pounded, badly breaded and completely under seasoned. The gravy tasted like it came from a powdered mix. The service was just non-existent. They barely gave us the time of day, I felt as if I was interrupting their texting with my presents.  And the tables and room in general weren't clean, even our server's clothing was dirty. I won't be coming back, there are too many great restaurants to be treated badly and eat mediocre food."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Try the cheese curds, they're delicious. The atmosphere is great for an evening out with friends. Grab a beer or a cocktail and relax playing giant Jenga!  Friendly staff. Best in the colder weather since it's mostly outside."}
{"text":"Beer was yum.  Brat was a little dry for my hubby. Falafel sandwich was SERVED burnt. Caesar salad a NO. (Lesson, order Brat at the Brat Haus!). Fried pickles were obnoxiously salty.  Fries were great!  Waiter was sweet, very helpful and polite.   Will I go back....hopefully not. I want to love this place!  Really I do!  If you go there, I hope they are better for you!"}
{"text":"Mixed review.   4 of us.  Dinner, outside.   Fries. A Schnitzel  C Beet salad.  A Brats. C+ Beers. C-  not enough foam, carbonation, and too warm.  German potato salad. A+ Nutella milk shake. C+ Pie. D. Taste average, but the tiniest piece I've ever seen.    Consensus.  2 don't want to come back....2 might, eventually, maybe."}
{"text":"Had dinner on 7/19. We were promptly greeted and sat at a long bar table inside. I really liked the atmosphere, very clean and modern, but still warm with the wooden tables. We ordered the specialty brat by Chef Beckett with pickled onions as well as the kosher brat with kraut. All of their ingredients are homemade I as I was informed by our waitress. I really liked the Dijon mustard and thought the kraut was fresh, not too salty. We also ordered fries with dipping sauces. I assume the fries are twice fried, so if you like them crunchy, order them up. The truffle aioli and bleu cheese bacon dipping sauces were best. Sriracha dipping sauce is a good concept, but wasn't particularly flavorful.   The beer selection is great! Green Flash Palate Wrecker was priced very well, as was the Rasputin we ordered. A nice selection of a variety of beers, which I thought were fairly priced. (Sorry to Bud and Coors fans, get your cheap beer-water fix elsewhere)."}
{"text":"Update: this is nothing at all new to anyone who knows this place, but it bears repeating. The brats here are amazing. Just the right balance bwtween crunchy and al-dente, with the outer skin perfectly crisp. The flavor of the haus brat was amazing, with just the right amount of bite and spice.   How do you describe a flavor? You don't, you just say yum, and people know what you mean (see triple D or Andrew Zimmern's show on food network for proof). Yeah, so they ran out of ribs, so I got the haus brat. You can't go wrong. Simply come here and order any brat, and you'll be G2G.  You know what's an oft-overlooked aspect of German hotdogs? The bun. Simply an amazing tasting bun here. For proof, next time you order your dog, eat the sausage separetly from the bun. Trust me you won't  be disappointed!  The bar area is cool here. Might be my new go-to spot in Old Town when its not busy. This weekend there's apparently a bbq festival at Talking Stick, so I'm guessing that's why this normally packed spot on Friday nite 9pm is only half full. The barkeeps are real people and down to earth. We just uncorked a sour bottle of wine. It was sour on purpose. The buyer didn't like it, so the bartenderette (the one with the dutch cut) poured everyone shots of what little remained. It wasn't my cup of tea. But the hefeweisen I ordered - #7 not the grapefruit flavored #5 was pretty nice. Better than Pyramid. If that's a compliment.  Verdict: upon second inspection, this place has gone up a rung in my book."}
{"text":"So I've been here a few times now and I must say, I'm a fan of the menu additions! Brat Haus has also done a bit of renovating since I was last in and they managed to add about 10-12 seats inside the restaurant.  The best part of their new menu might be the poutine. Yes, hand cut fries with a pork gravy and cheese curds. Their poutine is just a tad different in that the gravy is LOADED with meat.  I shared it with a friend and I probably should've called it quits there.... but I didn't.  I forged on and had the duck brat with sauerkraut and spicy peppers. The spicy peppers are red bell peppers, pickled to be spicy. They are fabulous!  You'll feel your core temp rise after eating a few.  And the kraut is homemade, served fresh and crunchy, not overly briny... Meaning its actually good! I added their dijon mustard too ... whoa! It was a party in my mouth. FYI, they have about 5 mustards on the table, all of which are housemade and all are pretty darned good. Then, as if I hadn't stuffed myself already, we decided to share a butterscotch root beer float. The server suggested making the float \"adult style\" which meant we'd be adding root beer vodka to the mix!  It was difficult to share, but very yummy.  Service was good, not great, but not awful.  My beer was gone for about 6-7 minutes before she came around to check on my thirst.  It won't keep me away, I'll just be better about making sure I get a water at the beginning to tide me over any dry periods."}
{"text":"A while back I got a chance to meet Chef Payton Curry and try his cuisine at Welcome Diner his short lived concept in Downtown Phoenix, incorporating planned obsolescence. Post Welcome Diner, Curry could be found making guest chef appearances at various restaurants around town as well as throwing \"Guerrilla dinners\" with his merry bunch of culinary misfits. Over the past few months Curry has been keeping his culinary skills sharp in the kitchen of Chef Charlene Badman at Scottsdale hot spot FnB.  Fast forward to Today and the first service at Curry's newest venture, Brat Haus.  Nestled in the space formerly occupied by Oregano's Pizza, Brat Haus is spread out among two buildings with a \"climate controlled\" outdoor patio. (The 360 degree mister was a nice touch and quite refreshing on a hot day but I don't know if I would go as far as agreeing with our hostess that the patio is climate controlled)  First up from the Haus, a stone hearth pretzel I have been drooling over on Facebook for the past week.  This rustic pretzel, served with grainy Haus mustard, is just what I had been hoping it would be (so much for maintaining objectivity).  A combination of hard and chewy, kissed with the perfect amount of salt, the Haus pretzel does not disappoint.  If I hear of anyone asking for cheese sauce to dip one of these happy little twists in, I may cry).  I've eaten my fair share of Bratwurst including a few while in Germany which were pretty memorable but over-all, i've just never eaten one and exclaimed \"DAMN! that's delicious.\"  Well, I can no longer make that statement as the Spicy brat ($5.75) topped with my choices of spicy peppers (of course) and root beer onions nestled in a chewy french roll just plain rocked.  Juicy, flavorful and possessed of the perfect meaty texture, the traditional spicy brat is a winner. (there will be many more of these in my future)  Accompanying my brat were thrice-cooked belgian fries ($4.50/Large).  Lightly seasoned frites, crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside as they should be, served with choice of dipping sauces (in this case truffle aioli and Sriracha Aioli), the Hause fries are not only a perfect companion to a brat but a necessity in my humble opinion.  Last but not least, the ubiquitous hamburgers, or are they?  You will find a \"regular\" burger in the form of the Haus Favorite but that is where the \"norm\" ends.  There is a brat burger i'd probably want for breakfast every morning consisting of a 1/3lb pork sausage patty topped with a fried egg and swiss cheese ($6.75) and the 800 pound gorilla in the room, the \"Pig Mac.\"($7.25)  What's this you say? The Pig Mac? Let me get this straight, Curry thinks it's a good idea to combine a 1/4lb pork sausage patty with a 1/4lb ground beef patty topped with caramelized onions, bound with something called \"Hush Hush sauce?\"  Well it's a good gawddamned thing Curry has the twisted mind he does because there are few things pork can't make better and apparently a juicy, well seasoned hamburger is one of them.  I don't know why I haven't thought of doing this before but it works.  This mingling of textures and flavors going on here is like the crossing of the proton streams in Ghostbusters except I didn't end up with marshmallow goo on my face.  I must say, I would have rather had a traditional spicy brat split and perched atop my burger a bit more as I preferred its texture and spiciness to the patty but again, this is a winner.  It's about time someone broke the mold and opened a restaurant that didn't fall into line with the current trend of cookie-cutter concepts, frozen yogurt, cupcake shops and gourmet burger joints come immediately to mind.  Curry and his Brat Haus have brought something simple, fresh and different to the Scottsdale culinary scene. (I'm sure others will follow in short order)."}
{"text":"Went there for a business get together and had a great time. Sat outside and played the huge Jenga game. Only had pretzels, sliders and other apps but it was all very good."}
{"text":"I went back to Brat Haus today for their Oktoberfest celebration. The place was packed, and it was great to see a local restaurant be doing so well after opening fairly recently.   I was pleased to see some improvements to the food--it seems like the brats fill up most of the bun now compared to what I've seen in the past, and I also think it was a great idea to convert the vegan brat to a burger, since the mashed consistency lends itself better to a burger than a brat.   The music was also slightly better than the last time I went--there was nothing that made me do a double take too badly other than some bad, Nickelback-y type of rock.  The service was a little slow but forgiveable considering the crowd. I'd love to go back again soon!"}
{"text":"This place is doing it right, I had a sampler of sausages, and they were amazing. So much flavor and cooked perfectly, nice and juicy and not at all dry. Quality bread too!! Nice beer selection and a wonderful outdoor patio area. Good service and just a fun vibe as well. I highly recommend this place if you're heading in to Old Town!"}
{"text":"Welcome to Old Town, Brat Haus. Stay as long as you like!   I am so happy that Payton Curry decided to bring his new concept to Old Town. We need more \"out of the scene\" spots like this! This restaurant/bar is casual, cool and nothing like many of the \"sceney\" spots that surround it in Old Town. Here, it's all about unique craft brews and one-of-a-kind brats.   I like beer, but sadly I don't know my beers like I should. Brat Haus houses a selection of top notch beers from all around and for those who lack beer knowledge like me, they have a menu that describes each of the beers and even describes what the different types of beers mean. Now, if you are a beer snob or wish you could be one, this will be your brewski haven because you'll enjoy some delicious options.   The food here has a simple concept but there's nothing simple about the thought that goes into these culinary delights. The main entree items are brats and you can enjoy classic ones like a beer brat or spicy brat, but they also have creative options like Thai Chicken brats, Spanish Pork Chorizo, Vegan Grain Sausage and even Rattlensake! I also noticed some tasty looking burgers and some yummy salad options like a Spinach salad with bacon croutons and a Chopped Wedge Salad with Bleu Cheese Bacon dressing.   For the meal, we started with the homemade pretzels and sharp cheddar cheese fondue. The pretzel was like nothing I've ever had and I could tell it was definitely not your Costco pretzel. It was soft, salty and perfect when dipped in the fondue or the homemade mustard. Since this was my first time here, I decided to order a classic brat so I went with the beer brat. We got the large order of Belgium fries for the table to go with our brats.   After biting into my brat, I realized that I've never had a brat like this anywhere. They were brats with a foodie-twist and definitely in a good way. I don't know what type of beer they used in the brat but it gave it a unique flavor. I ordered root beer onions and spicy peppers for my toppings. Tasty!! The Belgium fries were salty, crunchy and just what the doctor ordered. I enjoyed the variety of condiments, including curry ketchup! Everything here is a simple concept but with a culinary and unique twist. Even the pickles weren't your average \"from a jar pickle.\" They were round!   This is definitely being added to my list of Old Town favorites and I can't wait to come back and visit, especially when the whether cools down and we can utilize they spacious patio!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience... We made reservations and were told they had no tables available.  After finding us a table (which the my weren't very pleasant about) it look nearly 20 min to take our order.  Only had the food came out the other 1/2 Was delayed 15 min and then we ere still missing plates.  Food quality was poor and service was horrible.        If I may add a few words. My fianc√© had checked out several restaurants and shared with me their website and by the pictures we were excited to call and make reservations.  It was my birthday and we just wanted some great German food .  We arrived on a Sunday. The hostess would not work with us on a table for six with two young children.  Then when we finally sat down to order. The waitress seemed to be bothered by us asking questions and looked as though she really did not want to be at work.  Very sloppy plates of food and had lack of care when it took them 30 minutes to burn a \"hot dog\"  and not come to table to let us know right away as to what happen.  There were two starving children who keep asking  us about there food and upset when oily French fries and burnt hot dogs came to the table.   Again the the menu is deceptive as well as the pictures. Never will we recommend this restaurant  to friends or family.   Zero!! Zero!! Goose egg for sure.   Oh and one more thing they would not allow birthday cake to be brought to share on my special day."}
{"text":"We try to stop here every year, but probably last time for us. Made sure we went before a line formed. Service today was the worst EVER! We were so very disappointed! Food was ok, beer good as always but our server seemed overwhelmed by large tables. Yes our tip reflected being ignored! Couldn't get anyone to even fill our water glasses and wasn't going to continue to ask! As I said before we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch and had an amazing experience.  I sat outside in the Biergarten which was a perfect place for lunch. The bartender was covering outside as well as inside but was still out to visit my table quickly. He took the time to explain the menu to me and had an in depth knowledge of the rather large beer list and how the beer would pair with the various brats on the menu.  I find it very refreshing to have someone who just doesn't memorize the menu (which is a step above the server who fails to even be familiar with the menu), but actually knows the menu and how the various offerings work together.  The food was in line with the great service I received. I especially enjoyed the Belgian Fries.  I look forward to my next visit to Brat Haus!"}
{"text":"German eatery featuring an impressive amount of beer options to drool over. They have a list of unique bratwursts to choose from but the highlight are the fries. This restaurant is actually in the top 10 list for \"Best French Fries\" in Phoenix and they have most definitely earned that position. The fries are served on a small sheet pan and parchment paper. This creates a serving style that facilitates sharing by opening up space so there is ample room for all the eager fingers to snatch up some fries all at the same time. With the fries comes multiple delectable sauces to choose from with the truffle sauce being my highest recommendation."}
{"text":"I LOVE the Brat Haus!! They have a backyard style open seating in the back with a fun art wall, games, and picnic table style seating. The food is so yummy! I had the chicken brat with fries. The staff is always very nice and very attentive even when they're busy."}
{"text":"Omg!!  Soooo Fabulous!!  our 1st time here! parking is a pain. But other than that,  great atmosphere and great food.  I had the sweet brat with spicy peppers and house mustard. Soo good. I had the side of garlic fries with ranch all over. Garlic lover's heaven.  I don't drink beer, but the variety here is phenomenal!   We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"BRAT HAUS is a staple in old town. They have just revamped their menu and all of the German Beers are still amazing. I got word that they just bought out Union Barrell House next door so yes, THERE WILL BE (great) PARKING!!!! I tried the Umami sausage dish and it was spectacular!"}
{"text":"Cool look to this place, great spot to have beers and munch on pretzels."}
{"text":"i never consider this place to eat because the name implies \"meat only\" and i don't eat any meat. shame on me. met a buddy here for a few beers from their well rounded beer list. i chose a flight of 4  5oz pours for 12 bucks. tried beers i've never had before (and 2 that i would never again!). but the kicker was the burger...the veggie burger! it was homemade, huge, and delicious. so flavorful and even moist. the bun was huge, but i didn't eat the bun anyway, just the patty. one of the best veggie burgers i've ever eaten. my buddy got the same thing plus an order of the garlic fries with 4 different sauces. i had a few and had to forcefully stop myself from eating more! they were so crunchily tasty.  the service was perfect, very relaxed but attentive. but the outdoor dining is the best part. it is family style seating, as would be in the beer houses of Germany. so on a busy night, you might sit with folks you don't know....awesome! there are heat lamps and a huge firepit for cold nights. they have cornhole off to the side and a 2000 dollar ping pong table!!!! suhweeet!  prices are great for the substance of food. and i hear the pretzels are phenomenal!"}
{"text":"As promised - return trip revealed a bun upgrade at Brat Haus.  The perfect bun upgrade merits that fifth star.  Seriously fun place where they take their ingredients serious."}
{"text":"Definitely a positive experience here over the weekend.  I love the open air seating area even though I actually ended up eating in the bar (there was a wait and the bar was avaialable).    Food (4 stars) Pretzels with beer+cheese sauce = Heaven on a plate, I would almost fly to Pheonix just for this pretzel!!  Seriously the best pretzels I've ever had.  Chorizo Brat - Good spicy southwestern flavor Lamb Brat - Tasty though I wouldn't say it particularly tasted like lamb Rattlesnake brat - Had to do it since I've never had rattle snake and well worth ordering, similar meat consistency to aligator (no surprise there)  Serivice (5 stars) Very good positive attitude from the people we dealt with.  Great service from the bartender who while busy still checked on us regularly.  And the host did come find us to see if we still wanted a table and let us know it was still going to be a while.  I look forward to coming back on my next trip to Phoenix, especially for that pretzel and some german beer."}
{"text":"This place is great.... the perfect place to enjoy the beautiful Arizona weather with awesome company. The courtyard is big and has cool games like tether ball, ping pong, giant jenga and more, plus lots of seating. However it is not dog-friendly (insert sad face)  And, oh, the BEER. If you are a beer fan, you will love this place. Awesome selection of authentic german beers and more. Definitely the best place in old town for GOOD beer, without a doubt.   Food is great too. I highly recommend their sliders. The brats are good as well, but I am not a brat connoisseur, so they all kind of taste the same to me (still good though). However, they put them on a great crusty roll and are accompanied by a selection of awesome, high-quality mustards. You get to select one topping to go on your brat as well, and I love the apricot chutney, if you are into the sweeter side of things.   Also, been meaning to try this: they have a menu item I believe is called \"The Whole Hog.\" Anywho, the idea is to get 20-ish of your closest friends together and order this item, as it is feeds large groups.  Sounds like fun. Anyone done it and enjoyed it?  Anyway, great place to hang out, play games, DRINK AWESOME BEER, and enjoy good food.  Yay Brat Haus!!!"}
{"text":"This place is god awful wasn't going to eat here in the first place but one of the chefs saw us outside debating and convinced us, sat down, ordered got our burgers 35 mins later and were cold and cheese was just slapped on unmelted, then asked to have the cheese melted and the bartender said he would take care of the burgers bc of the wait and unmelted cheese and still charged us anyway. 0/10 do not recommend I feel sick after eating here not to mention a 14$ burger does not come with any sides...."}
{"text":"After a couple of times drinking here, I finally came to have a brat! I'm bummed that I haven't come in for that before, because they're delicious! I had the Haus Brat and added onions & peppers and sauerkraut. I'm surprised they don't already come with sauerkraut, but you definitely need to do that for one of your add-ons :) We also tried the pickle chips for an appetizer, which were a little too salty in my opinion, but still really good. Theirs are light on batter and mostly pickle, so if you like pickle chips like that you'll like these! It also comes with a really good ranch."}
{"text":"I don't eat hot dogs. I'm not a fan of brats/sausage. Well... I am a huge fan when it comes to Brat Haus brats!!  I LOVE the brats here.    It's converted me. Entirely!!  I crave the duck and date one, with root beer onions. I don't even use any mustard! There's such wonderful sweet, meaty flavor -- and the bread choice is excellent compliment.   Great beer on tap and excellent prices on happy hour.  A Yelp check in got me to try the nutella and soft pretzel which I am now also addicted to."}
{"text":"I can't wait to try this place again! I had the bacon cheese fries and they were AMAZING. the atmosphere was fantastic. And they even have a wall you can write on."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Nice outdoor seating, great beer menu, and awesome food. I wish there were more places like this."}
{"text":"Make sure if in a party of 8 or more that it must be on one check and automatically charged 20% !!!  They even stuck on a couple that arrived an hour after the first group and sat at a different table.  .  I guess it's guilt by association."}
{"text":"Complete disappointment!  I read about the way they make fries and went to try them.  All I can say is COLD, SMOOSHY, COLD, ICK!  My friend was nervous because we were the only customers at noon, but I wanted to try the fries, so we stayed.  Bad Idea!    The waitress sat us inside, as requested, but then left us. We had to get our own straws; she took a great while to come see about us; she just sort of disappeared.  When she gave us the crinkled, dirty menu, she said \"this is our lunch menu.\"  Turns out, it's the only menu. She told us that \"hush, hush\" sauce was a thousand island style sauce, but it was actually a white sauce.  I didn't dare put it on the fries because I didn't want the fries any colder.    The inside seats were super uncomfortable; they were metal chairs that looked big enough for children's Sunday school classes.  Outside seating  was just picnic tables.  When I spend $12 for a la carte cheeseburger, I want to be able to relax into a nice chair.  We never saw anyone else come in the dining room while we were there, which was lunch rush, and only two outside tables had customers when we left around 12:45. I definitely know why, and, worst of all, my friend was right.  When the place is empty at lunch rush, RUN away!  Did I mention that the fries were cold, smooshy, and ick!"}
{"text":"We tried the sampler cuz we just had brunch and wanted a snack and a place to chill. Four star for the beer selection and the great recommendation by the waiter. The sample had the Haus, hot Italian, with pickled onion and Sweet Sausage with pickled pepper. Love the collection of sauces!"}
{"text":"Incredible soft and warm pretzel choice with amazing 4 cheese bock melted. Ordered braut  with boar meat....delicious and too much for one time meal. Took plenty home. Also had a soft and crisp battered schnitzel with potatoes and delicious mushroom gravy.   Prices were expensive about  $14-16 a plate. Yet, large portion and close enough to Deutsch meal. What do you expect the place is in North Scottsdale,  richy area  Bier selection was limited with Ca, and U.S. Brewers. ..need more Deutsch selections.  Approved"}
{"text":"Beer, Bags and Music.  Having a 360 degree mister was great.  Even though its in the 100's the patio is nicely shaded and the misters work great!  Pretzels are a must have!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! The brats were good and had some unique options for toppings that gave it a different flare. The beer was amazing! I had the Hefeweisen, which had this subtle banana flavor, but tasted amazing. I loved the atmosphere of the outdoor patio area. The service was friendly and quick and helpful with recommendations."}
{"text":"They have two speeds for service......slow and stop.  The pretzel was quite possibly the worst I've had.  You could do better at the movie theater.  The sandwiches, kraut, and fries weren't too bad, but not worth coming back for.  The main reason for the 1 star is the sausages.  Tried a couple different ones and both were incredibly dry and grainy.  Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been here countless times and have enjoyed every visit with one exception. Don't ever order the veggie burger. Which, I should have known, eating at a place named after meats, but alas, I tried to venture forth.  Besides that one unpleasant experience, i have nothing but good things to say about Brat Haus. The staff is so friendly, so much so that we had a \"regular\" waitress for a bit there and she would recognize us (which has been a dream of mine, very Cheers-esque) and even taught us how to say you're welcome in German. I tend to always get a pretzel and the chicken brat. However, I've had a bite of the house brat recently at the Sugar Ray concert at the Downtown Chandler Concert Series and my gosh... I would highly recommend.  The cheese curds too. My gosh, how have written this review so far and not mentioned their golden, crunchy, cheesy goodness. A MUST.  As a tip, they tend to come out to the events in Downtown Chandler, the Oktoberfest, the Concert Series... Fun events and good food"}
{"text":"This is my second favourite restaurant in Scottsdale. After reading a review that mentioned it was TOO child-friendly, we had to try it. How could a restaurant be too child-friendly, ever? I loved the combination of adult-friendly food and drink and Nutella shake, and child-friendly back patio. The miniVW bus up front was pretty cool too. We happened to eat there at the same time as the previous owner of the vehicle so heard some stories on it as well. I take this place over Peter Piper any day. As a matter of fact, I wish they would convert the one on Watson Rd to a West-side Brat Haus..."}
{"text":"Being married to a woman raised in Germany, I know authentic German food, and this is not. Regardless, it's good. Real good.   If you like brats, you'll love this place. I should also note that the outdoor patio is quite nice, on par with the Fillmore Vig downtown. The service? No complaints there either.  We shall return."}
{"text":"Thank you Brat Haus for rescuing our attempted  dining experience down the street. The service was great right off the bat, and with a group of 9 our waitress did an out standing job.  The food was pretty great as well. I had the duck sausage with hot peppers and it was really, really good. I also got the pork belly and watermelon, also awesome, and the fried pickles to split.  Excellent craft beer selection as well with several local brews on tap. I've had them bookmarked for a while now and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Attention all meat eaters! This place is phenomenal. We've been here half a dozen times since it opened. We haven't had anything bad. Excellent service. Finger licking food. Best brats in Arizona. We can't wait for it to cool off and sit on their extensive patio! A+"}
{"text":"Dad wanted German food when he was in town visiting me. I found this place via Yelp and it was a wonder suggestion. We sat in their inside restaurant area. They also had a bar room and a fun looking outdoor patio. The beer was imported from Germany and very tasty and the food was hot, steamy, and fill of flavor. They have 6 sauces you can use but real Germans use spicy mustard. It was so good I brought my mom here when she visited a few weeks later.   Parking can be a little tricky in this area. I found it's easiest to park in the parking corral just around the corner. Next the rehab burger."}
{"text":"I cant believe this place is still open. the food was terrible. they do have a great beer selection but that's about it. Not even close to German food. Who ever is pickling the food over there deserves to be shot."}
{"text":"Had lunch here last week with Rand H and Mike C at my suggestion.  The menu looked at awesome and I couldn't wait to try the brats.  I had the Duck, Duck, Dates with the apricot sauce on top.  The sausage was very tasty, but it sure was a tiny little thing!  They could have served it with a roll 1/2 the size and eased up on the amount of the apricots, which totally masked the flavor.  I also had the fries, which were very good, and the blue cheese bacon dipping sauce that had no flavor at all and looked like milk more than a dipping sauce.  I also loved the pickled veggies they served with the sandwich.  I am not a fan of high top tables either, and the only regular tables are outside.    The food was great, but as far as value goes, there are much better options out there.  I'd go back if I were in the area and hungry, but doubt I'd go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"I went to Brat Haus for lunch today with Local First Arizona. I was really excited when I saw they have a veal sausage on the menu. I was hoping it was a bockwurst - a white veal sausage that I've never been able to find in Arizona. I ordered it and it's not a bockwurst - still very good, but not a bockwurst.  I had the pretzels and they were fantastic.  I also ordered a vanilla shake. I like thick shakes so I was excited when it came out with a wide straw. Unfortunately it wasn't as thick as it looked, but still good."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch earlier in the week and really enjoyed my experience at the Brat Haus.  The interior space is split into two areas and is now decorated in a military/industrial theme to a certain extent.  The menu is meat-centric although they do have a few salads.  I chose the sweet brat with apricot onions.  I also liked dipping the brat in the honey mustard sauce that was available at the table.  I'll come back another time and start trying the large selection of craft beers they have on tap."}
{"text":"Went here at 7pm on a Saturday and I honestly have no complaints. You can see from my other reviews that I'm very picky about my 5-star ratings and I couldn't come up with one reason to ding a star after our experience here. This is probably the least pretentious and upscale place that I've ever given a 5-rating to.  We came back here with friends after hubby and I had a great time at the Yelp Elite event here a few months back. The actual location is two separate buildings plus abundant outdoor seating with misters and heat lamps. There was a bar area that we didn't go into, and a small cafe-type area which is where we sat. Since we were a party of 6 they sat us at the big central table, where we were elbow to elbow with other diners already there. We ordered a ton of food, beer and other drinks and it was all excellent. Our server was at the top of his game as well.  Whatever else you eat here, DO NOT miss the pretzels with beer cheese dip. I'm serious. When you think you want Bavarian style pretzels this is what you have in mind. The waiter told us that they actually do use a lye solution here, which is the traditional way of getting the dark crust on them. Most places use baking soda which is close but not quite right. And the beer cheese dip was awesome enough to just eat with a spoon.  Same goes for the french fries with dips. We demolished two large orders and all 4 of the dips we tried were awesome. The real heart of the menu is the brats though. Next time we go here (and there will be a next time), I'll order that instead of the burger. I was happy with my burger (and if relish always tasted like that I'd eat more relish), but my friend's brat looked awesome enough that I regretted not getting one.  The beer menu was extensive and everyone at my table seemed happy with what they ordered. I had a \"grown up\" Nutella milkshake which was every bit as delicious as you'd expect from the name. I'm not sure what kind of alcohol was in it- maybe spiced rum, but it was perfect with the Nutella."}
{"text":"Since I can't give half stars, I'm giving my review the benefit of the doubt with 5 stars instead of the 4.5 stars I want to give. I went here today with family for my dad's birthday. For a sunday afternoon, it was kinda slow but the ambience inside was pretty cool. We were seated at the large table, which could seat about 15, even though there were only 5 of us. There were a lot of beer choices and I decided to order the raspberry beer, which is amazing! The size of the glass was pretty small for $8 but still a great beer!  We ordered the pretzel appetizer and loved them! The pretzels were huge and the dipping sauces were great! I We also ordered the Belgian fries with sirracha and ranch for dipping. There are other dipping sauce options but those were the ones we chose. In the middle of our table, there were bottles of ketchup, mustard and other arranged sauces. Fries were good, nice they left the skin on them! My mom and sister ordered the field greens salad as well and I was able to taste it. I personally didn't like the dressing (too bitter) but my mom and sister liked it. The greens, veggies and toppings in the salad were good just not the dressing.  For lunch, I ordered the turkey sausage with apple & sage. I chose the apricot and onion chutney as my topping. I loved the chutney and was also able to try my mom's root beer onions, which were good. The sausage was tasty, just not a fan of the pieces of mustard seeds I got throughout the brat. The bread was really delicious, nice crust on the outside and soft on the inside. I didn't feel like it was too big for the brat, which has been a critique I've noticed in other reviews.  For dessert, they brought out the drunken cake. It was a generous portion of cake and it tasted good. We also ordered the soft serve ice cream and the butterscotch root beer float. I was pretty disappointed with the \"soft serve\" because they didn't have chocolate ice cream and the ice cream wasn't soft serve. The texture was off but still tasted fine. Not worth the $3.50 though! The float was also a big hit as well!  Overall, I would come back and try a different sausage and a different beer. Prices are a tad high but for Scottsdale, that's really not unusual. Everyone in my party enjoyed the food too!"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for some German food, the food was terrible.  The sausage was dry and the bread was stale and hard."}
{"text":"Good place, good beer, and always fun stuff going on at this place. The only reason this isn't a 5-star rating is that the sausages are never amazing, just good.   Highly recommend going when they have the accordion and tuba player as those guys are awesome and super fun.   Overall, would recommend."}
{"text":"Great look and feel to the place, food was pretty good.  However  the poor customer service killed it for me.  I'm not a fan.    It was like they didn't seem to care about the customers, unless you are a regular.   Almost like we were a nuisance. They must have had more important late night activities to go to.  Sorry we bothered you, good luck."}
{"text":"The beer was plentiful, the food was fresh and the atmosphere was perfect.  Being in Munich (or Vegas) is the only thing better!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  Enjoy their beer selection.  The sausages are good.  Honestly I just love the outdoor area.  Big picnic tables.  The games.  The atmosphere.  Great place to just hang and drink!  Love it!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The atmosphere is so inviting. The majority of their seating is outdoors where you can enjoy the sun. The Brats are delicious with many different toppings and sauces. They have a large selection of beers and even some on draft. I will definitely be back to this location frequently. Delicious."}
{"text":"Good place with an impressive import beer menu and a food  menu that takes a twist on traditional biergarten fare.  I don't think it was mind blowing but it was a solid meal.  They were out of the Hofbrau original which unfortunately is the only helles offered on the beer menu.  The brats are good and I was entertained by the exotic brat options (kangaroo tonight)."}
{"text":"Spicy brat, pretzels and fries were great. Vegan black bean burger wasn't so good. Manager took it off the bill though. Great venue and staff."}
{"text":"While wandering around Scottsdale, we happened upon this place.  It looked inviting, so we went in. I had the pork schnitzel with a salad (instead of German potato salad or and a Molotov Mule. My husband had the Das Brat and a ginormica vat of beer. The food was ok, however, I think it is overpriced and we walked away feeling as though we spent too much for what we got. If I ever find myself there again, I will probably just go with a pretzel and skip the rest."}
{"text":"Parking here SUCKS. Street parking only and don't even try to park next door. They watch that parking lot like hawks and will boot you before you even place your order at Brat Haus. It would be wonderful if Brat Haus and the place next door could work out some kind of parking agreement because they have a large lot but dont get super busy until the evenings where-as Brat Haus gets a lot of day traffic.   Anyhow, the food here was really good. All the dips and items with mustard were perfect. The service was fantastic.   Even though it is stupid hot out in the summer, they have lots of fun ways to cool off- misters, fans, and a big bounce house-style water slide for everyone. There are lots of outdoor games (darts, corn hole, etc) and kids and dogs are very welcome. They even have food for the pups!   So, why the 3-star review? The prices were a little steep and they have got to figure out a better parking solution. Otherwise, it really was A-Ok!"}
{"text":"Cheap beer. Awful service. Waitress treats us like they're bothering them by sitting in to have dinner when they're a more than 4 of us."}
{"text":"I ate here about a year ago and had the fried chicken (can't remember the name, perhaps Chicken Schnitzel) and I have been craving it every day since but unfortunately I live too far away to frequent this fine establishment and it looks like they removed it from the menu! Heartbroken but I am sure everything else is just as tasty. The chicken dish was so crispy on the outside and ridiculously juicy on the inside. The flavors are still being dreamed about to this day and I have yet to have another place match this dish. It was served with a large salad which was also tasty but nothing compared to the chicken I can't get out of my head!  I sat at the bar and the service was top-notch. A good mix of regulars and new people. If ever they bring back my friend chicken dish, I will definitely be planning a trip to eat here again."}
{"text":"Really neat little place. Great outdoor space and hipster feeling inside.  Hand crafted artisan brats and beers and the pretzels with beer cheese sauce are awesome. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"So we came after an event where we had our dog with us.  Love, Love, Love that they have a menu item for dogs and she loved her brat!!!    We had the traditional brat, which was huge and we should have ordered one to share!  Loved the bun and the sausage itself was great.  I didn't really care for the sauerkraut but I'm picky about my sauerkraut so not surprised I didn't like it.    Great and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group on a Wednesday. it was pretty quiet out on the patio where we were. Inside was pretty rowdy with the Cubs/Dodgers game. I chose a light ale that was good enough that I had two. Nobody who knows me would be surprised I ordered the poutine. It was pretty good, I thought the pork belly was a bit chewy. Service was pretty good all evening. There is more stuff I would like to try on both the food and beer menus."}
{"text":"The Brats, pretzel, and beef sliders were good, the rest of the food was not very good. Especially the potato salad. The food and service wasn't very good either."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night and they place was very popular. The selection of beers was great and there is a lot to do there with bags, big jenga, and ping pong. The service was great and out party was 15 plus. I would defiantly recommend this place if your looking for a fun night out. Why the 3 stars then? The food selection is somewhat expected (brats), but I just didn't find them to be very good. The bread is too thick and the brats themselves don't have enough flavor.  Price 3 Food 2 Fun 5 Service 5 Quantity 3"}
{"text":"Place is neat I like the back area but the food is gross! Soggy old and just the worst I've had in a while. Save your money"}
{"text":"Meh. Belgian fries were great, but the brats were pretty boring. We had the Spicy Brat and the Southwest Chicken Brat. Neither had much flavor or spice. We also tried a pretzel, which was pretty good with the selection of mustards and ketchups on the table. The beer list was just ok too. Granted, we are spoiled with great beer and brats being Chicagoans... so take this with a grain of salt."}
{"text":"Wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great.  The brat and the mustards they had were very boring.  The fries were okay.  The service was a bit slow.  I love brats and basically all Germanic food, but this was definitely not the greatest I've had."}
{"text":"Drove 55 mins to this place to try the brats .The food was good nothing amazing for the very high prices. 1st order of fries dried over cooked and cold so we ordered another batch which we were charged for. The waiter/ server was not friendly at all he was rolling his eyes and was ignoring us. We had to ask another table for condiments since our waiter never came back then the waiter tried to take them from us.. We never got refills on drinks. The manager asked us if we were ok while passing by kinda like...ok at 100 miles per hour... This place needs better employees. Will not return should of read all the yelpers comments 1st. Awkward ambience if you are not Hispanic. Something is missing..."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on St. Patrick's Day weekend to cap off the night with a last drink.   Our server made a couple suggestions on their drink selection, since it was clear we were newbies in German craft biers.   We tried two new craft brews and I really liked mine. However, my friend went with a red ale, and unbeknownst to him, it turned out to be a Sour.   When our server came and asked us how we were doing, he remarked to him that he didn't like how tart his beer was. Our server took the beer away and gave us another selection on the house. What I really appreciated is that he ended up complimenting the more expensive beer and charged us the lower amount. Kudos to him for such a great gesture.   Minus one star because we had to chase down our server to order in the beginning when it really wasn't very busy...but I think they were trying to shut everything down for closing."}
{"text":"When you can parallel park in front of Salty's on a Friday night you know it's meant to be.   Look, for $6 you can stuff your face with one of the best damned sausages in the world. With or without the tasty bun. Your sausage comes with your choice of condiment (I chose the pickle relish for my beer brat and the sauerkraut for the lamb sausage) and if you have another $6 you can get a pint of Hefeweizen to accompany the sausage. Maybe dig around in your money belt and locate another $6 and order a Chimay instead of a Hefe? It'll come in an authentic Chimay glass, as will the other super legit crafty beers on the menu.  Try out the home made pretzel, but you don't need to dip it in fundido because the mustard is quite good and some fusion just doesn't quite work. Seriously...I know it's AZ and all, but that's a miss of a combination.  The staff is attentive and they know the menu well enough to riff with you on pairing beers with what you order from the food column. Our server said something about a Nutella-chocolate-malted shake at the end of the meal so we had to add that experience to the meal and it didn't disappoint at all. So good, in fact, that Nutella will be added to all home made milkshakes in my blender from now on.  I would come back again and again and again to Brat Haus."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great service. Riley always has a good beer recommendation if you are stuck (or spoilt for choice).   Last time I went they had an inflatable slip and slide setup. They always have Jenga too!!"}
{"text":"Inviting and friendly atmosphere.  The staff was great and the menu options looked so good I had trouble deciding.  Ended up have the Greek Plate with a yummy lamb sausage and Greek style salad.  Brat Haus is affordable and on my short list the next time I travel to the area."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, delicious array of mustards to pair with your brats and giant pretzel.   We stopped in just because of the super cool scene and back patio. The giant pretzel was the best pretzel i've ever had! Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Been nice to have eaten there but. Sure I want cool enough to get someone's attention to wait on me.  After sitting for a while I got up and left.  Not like  they were swamped either.   Saturday night I July.  Too bad for them. I have to give one star to post them but really you get none."}
{"text":"This place just keeps growing on me. The Schnitzel Sub is a perfect lunch. And Jaeger Stew is back for the season. Nice."}
{"text":"Took my parents for lunch yesterday. We all had the brats (of course, being from Wisconsin and all :) the cheese curds and brats were PERFECT! The staff was exceptional and we were surprised to see they partner with FootHills animal shelter and are dog friendly! We will return!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: I received a message from the owner, Dave. He said that the Brat Ha√ºs is NOT considered a German restaurant. \"We're a simple urban beer garden with a European influenced menu\"  and that Yelp mistakingly has it classified that way and refuses to change it. Ummm... ok.... Do you think somehow the name of the restaurant might have caused a little bit of that confusion? right?  Several of us rode to Scottsdale on our bikes and wound up at the Brat Ha√ºs for lunch. It's the only place around that wasn't too crowded, requiring a long wait. I was looking forward to eating lunch here because I am German and love German restaurants and atmosphere. I ordered the bottled root beer and beer brat with sauerkraut. The bottled root beer tasted authentic (duh), but the cooked brat, tasted dry, flavorless and was surprisingly small for the price. Yet, the bun was so wide, I could hardly put the whole thing in my mouth. I had to lift the little wiener off the bun to hunt for the saurkraut (sad).  After finishing my meal, I quietly announced that I was still hungry, only to find out that others at our table felt the same way. I've never left a restaurant hungry and always have to take a doggy bag. More food for the price please!!  Someone with us ordered a $10 beer in a small, stemmed glass. No thanks. We all know she didn't take any of that home with her. :-)  The atmosphere on the Brat Ha√ºs patio is far from authentic. Where's the German (polka) music? I don't remember hearing any music at all. Why aren't the waitresses wearing cute, sexy dirndls or lederhosen?! Where are the colorful hanging flowers that adorn the German patios and windowsills? The only thing that is truly authentically German at the Brat Ha√ºs is the way the tables are pushed together on the patio allowing total strangers to end up eating next to each other, like in Germany. What a disappointment!  I sincerely hope the owner does some much needed research on running a German restaurant or this place won't be in business long...sorry for my honesty."}
{"text":"Brats - jerk chicken, pepper jack and sweet were bland. Fries - burnt and tasteless Sauces - bland  The potato salad was interesting.  Nothing like what I have had in the pass, but the guys liked it.   The advice about trying the pretzel and going elsewhere for dinner was probably good, although we didn't try the pretzel.  The service - above average."}
{"text":"Went there for the pre-opening party and had the opportunity to sample everything.  This place is great, just what old town needed- something DIFFERENT!! They have 25 beers on tap tht have been carefully selected and can suggest what drink goes best with your meal! Plus they serve food late night that fantastic!  RUN to this place!!"}
{"text":"Great beer choices!  Think i counted 20 something on tap.   The beers are strong and unique enough the they put the % of alcohol next to each on the menu.   Cozy on the inside with lots of seating on the outside.    Great service.   If u are looking to try a purple/few exotic, strong beers...this place is perfect.    If ur looking for good prices on pitchers of beer, this probably ISN'T your spot."}
{"text":"Great place for a group of people to hang out. Lots of things to do there to keep you entertained. Food is good too!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the out door area with the and games. We had a blast, I had a braut with the sweet pickles onions and peppers and my daughter had a sausage. Delish. I would definitely come back again with more family it was a great out door dog friendly environment and the other patrons were fun too. Service  was great. I woulda gave 5 stars but I thought it was a little pricey and the app doesn't allow 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered from the beers to the food was spot on- the haus brats were flavorful, house mustard cleared up my nasal passages and that's a good thing.  There was not a single Belgian fry left in the basket even after they cooled down. They remained crunchy. The pickles and sauerkraut were fresh tasting because they are made in-house. It was great sitting outside like an authentic German beer garden even if there was artificial grass.  Great way to spend a sunny afternoon. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the beers and that made the experience complete."}
{"text":"I am not big on German food, generally speaking. But this place is outstanding.  Their beer selection is fantastic and their bratwurst and burgers are very very good. Great place to go if you enjoy mustard.  But, what stole my heart is their pretzels. Let me be perfectly clear: Brat Haus serves the best Pretzels I have ever had in my entire life. I will go out of my way to come back, just to have their Pretzels. They are perfectly authentic in every day, even down to the preparation with real lye. (Something most places are afraid to do) and the rock salt they are sprinkled with. I am frothing at the mouth just thinking about it. Words cannot describe.  I'd like to give this place 4 stars due to the cramped quarters and inadequate number of restrooms, (it is a little pricey too) but really I just don't have the heart to. The food and service were too good. So 5 it is."}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review after the bad experience I had here 5 months ago. The staff is all extremely friendly and helpful. They have an awesome staff, especially compared to five months ago. They were actually busier than expected for a Monday night, but they all apologized for the wait and were extremely helpful.  I would recommend going here for a couple drinks and appetizers. It's a relaxed environment and they have a great beer selection. Their mules are pretty good, although they are served in glasses instead of copper mugs."}
{"text":"UPDATE II-Visited Brat Haus for a second chance and what an improvement!  We were seated quickly, tended to professionally, and finally had the opportunity to try the menu.  Excellent spicy brats, wonderful pretzels, and delicious Gaffel Kolsch made our second trip a real treat.   UPDATE-Owner apologetic and accommodating following our one and only visit.  We intend to give it a second chance.  Horrible service. Called ahead, then arrived to find they never added our info.  Told a 15 minute wait.  After 50 minutes of waiting, finally got a table (inside, not outside as requested), then waited another 15 minutes with absolutely no visit from any server.  Decided to leave.  I was really excited to try the food, but not with that level of effort.  A flight to Germany would have been more bearable."}
{"text":"Ever been to Germany? Visit this place; it us legit. Food is on par with dishes I ate while stationed in Germany. The pepper jack cheese brat is amazing. The pretzels with beer cheese are money. Great outdoor seating (don't do it in the summer...don't do it!).   Beer selection is very nice. A little pricey on some of the selections, but it is Old Town. On occasion I'll order something and it's tapped out...and so us my second selection. Either people are drinking great beer faster than they can refill it or management needs to order a couple of extra kegs.   Service is not over the top, in your face, asking how everything tastes every 5 minutes. Appreciated. Managers do a run to ensure everything meets expectations. Smart touch.  Stop reading this and go eat there already. Legit."}
{"text":"How fun!  This was said over and over again on our most recent date night.  It was just that.  Driving around for parking was even fun - if you can imagine.  We wound up parking across the street in a parking lot that I think is used for overflow @ the hospital?  We saw these people bellied up to a moving bar - when we got closer we could see that it was something called Tour de Tavern.  Meet us @ the Brat Haus.  So it's powered by the people (think like a bicycle) and it goes to different bars throughout the night and I guess they wind up @ BH.  What a cute idea.  I will think about getting 15 friends together for this.  Sounds like fun.  Hubby is a big German food fan and I can usually find something to woof down.  This was so cute.  We approached, were seated immediately outside in their cute patio area.  Big picnic benches for community seating.  Tuba and accordion player belting out a little diddy.  Perfect.  We ordered beers and a pretzel with fundido for our appies.  Good.  Really good.  I picked the majority of the salt off of mine - it was just too much.  Cheese dip is thick and satisfying.  Beers were good.  We ordered two sausages each.  I loved mine and when we go back I will opt for no condiments.  I wound up scraping the majority of mine off and just eating it alone.  Which was great.  It was good by itself.  I didn't need two.  One is plenty with everything else we had.  We ordered fries too.  That siricha ketchup is so good.  I will try and make some on  my own.  It was that good.    No room for dessert we were done.  I bought a tee shirt for my sister that my waitress wore.  Speaking of our cute little waitress.  She knew her menu and was attentive without over doing it.  Someone else brought our food out and he managed to stick his finger in my ranch and acted like I didn't see it.  I asked our waitress if she would bring me a new one and she did - no questions asked.    Motto of the review.  HOW FUN!"}
{"text":"Best pretzels ever! Awesome beer garden with a giant Jenga game and corn hole toss game. Big communal tables add to the fun atmosphere. Servers are super helpful finding the perfect beer for you. And again, PRETZELS!!!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this place, feels like a place you could visit everyday and never get bored of it. Almost like hanging out in your own backyard, But better."}
{"text":"This is one of the places I miss about Scottsdale after moving out of the state. Great food, awesome personalities, and amazing beer. The garlic fries are to die for! Especially with the Truffle & Sriracha sauces on the side.  They do get a bit overwhelmed with the massive amounts of people. My friends had ordered some garlic fries as well and 1 person didn't get garlic on theirs and both orders where cold from sitting for a long while before being served, but we were there on a busy night so it was understandable.  if you like low-key places with outdoor seating and awesome food/beer, I highly recommend Brat Haus to any foodie or beer enthusiast."}
{"text":"I love the Brat Haus.  Great atmosphere...food good...drinks great.  Judi has been our bartender each time my husband and I visit.  She is friendly and outgoing...always has a smile on her face.  She is great with suggestions that we always take.  I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, outdoor seating, actives for the kids great food and drink.  We arrived before six, plenty of parking around back. Pretzel app, split a bratwurst plate, tri-tip sandwhich and the kids had schnitzels.  Free chili, you wouldn't know it's rattlesnake if it bit you, but had good flavor and heat. Beer selection is ample, may need more desert offerings."}
{"text":"My fourth trip to the Brat  Haus, this time with my teenage son, was another hit. This place has something for everyone: a killer beer selection, gourmet pub eats and a unique atmosphere. Let's start with the beer selection which features authentic German, Belgian and US microbrews on tap and a host of hard to find bottles. Each beer come with the correct glass. For example, I ordered a Zwick'l kellerweis and the delicious malty brew was served in authentic half liter ceramic stein. It is rare to find a bar which pays so much attention to the proper glassware, and it greatly enhances the experience. We sampled a top notch soft pretzel, excellent fries and out of this world brats with all the fixings. My son had a duck and date brat which had a wonderful smokey flavor while I enjoyed a beer brat which was a juicy treat. The patio which is situated between three small buildings evokes a European cafe atmosphere. The staff is attentive and well versed on the beer and food items. The owner even came by to check on our visit. This is a family friendly place which serves specialty sodas and even has waffles. A trip to the Brat Haus is like taking a trip to the Old World and never leaving Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"We knew that when Jeffrey Schoening was returning to the Valley and then to the Brat Haus that we were in for a treat, He is incredibly talented and has an impressive pedigree. Peg and I went last night to sample some of his changes that were just introduced..they were awesome! A shrimp roll that was incredibly flavorful, not overdressed, and almost half the price of what a lobster roll (not usually satisfying because it isn't exactly pulled out of the nearest ocean in AZ) was a winner. The wedge salad was a great version, and the beet appetizer was terrific. I had the schnitzel (wonderfully crunchy crust, juicy pork) served with cabbage. I know that a burger will be in my future as Chef makes incredibly non-pedestrian burgers that are flavorful but not. overly complicated. We have enjoyed this place from the time of Payton Curry. So glad that this Chef has returned to the Valley!"}
{"text":"I would like to give this place 3 1/2 stars if possible so yelp please work on that. I'm not a regular here and I have only been here 3 times.  This review is on the sausages, pretzel, fondu and wannabe \"Belgian fries\".  1. Sausage 4 stars  All their sausages taste great, each different one has a unique flavor, they are fresh and taste great. Only downside I have is they are pretty damn small for what you pay.  2. Pretzel pronounced Preeh-tzell in Deutsch. 5 stars  Hands down the best German style pretzel I have ever had since I moved here to the US from Germany. Yea mustard is ok with it, but salted European butter would make it taste 10 times better. If you want it in bulk google German Deli and look up Laugen Brotchen.  The fondu on the other hand is something to be desired. My second biggest disappointment.  3. Trice fried \"Belgian Fries\" ...... 0  I had high hopes for Pommes Frites and was let down like Buffalo Bills fan of the 90's. Everyone knows that has visited or lived in Europe, that you only find real fries to be thick cut. Not like steak fries though. Yea you have your chain places and fast food restaurants that serve skinny fries from the freezer, but a good wurst stand will serve real fries. Thick cut, fried twice, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Something that will hold up to a good mayo or being drenched in curry ketchup. Every time I ordered it here, they were burned overly crispy and skinny like McDonald's fries.  Their beer selection is nothing to scoff at. Lots of beers to choose from even though again a little over priced.  Overall this place does great marketing, serves good to great food and is probably a place to be seen at for the Scottsdale \"in\" crowd. If my wallet allows me I'll be back for more brats, pretzel and beer, if I want a good German meal I will drive my ass to Haus Murphy's. Introduce a good Doner  Kebab and I will eat every time in town.  I'll be back Brat Haus AZ"}
{"text":"Great service we sat at the Bar. Cook even came out just to make sure we were all set! Ordered sliders, fries, rattlesnake chili, wings oh my. ALL were delish!!  :-) #5 Draft is Amazing: Weihenstephaner Hefe WeissbierBeer #Boom"}
{"text":"So, we were going to catch a bite to eat before we started the new years night. We initially told they were done serving. Then the manager (Chad) came over and told us that we actually could eat. He introduced us to our server (Chance), and everything after that was golden! Good food and good service! Thanks for a great night.."}
{"text":"Do you like pig?  Do you like Brats?  If you answered yes to these questions; run; do not walk to this restaurant.  It is freaking amazing.  I've spent tons of time instilling flavors into my brats, and they just blow it out of the park.  Homemade; smoked; just; I'm drooling right now; a day after I've been there.  I will be in phx again, and I will be at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Out of towner here, had the chance to come in on a Friday night and here is a breakdown:  +2 stars for the location, great, awesome, patio was great to take advantage of the great weather AND it had fantastic games like giant jenga, tether ball, ping pong, etc. +2 stars for the drinks, nothing like good cheap stiff drinks -1 star for the service, the waiter we had was rocking some attitude, very likely just the one guy and not representative of the whole staff"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a beer. Burgers are great! Good brats with a nice verity of toppings. Really like the ambiance of the place and it will be a great hang out place when the wether is cool out. The drunken date cakes is a must have!"}
{"text":"I want to give this place more stars but I just can't. We just came from Germany and yes, we have been to the real HB in Munchen. The set up of a bier garden was great, however, the music they were playing is not at all of German music not to mention the huge colored mexican painting on the wall. Not cool and that threw it all off. Our waitress was great. She was always checking in on us. I would like to comment though that when a couple says \"we'll have one more\" that it means one more round of two beers, not just one beer. My wife's schnitzel sandwich was very good. Lots of flavor and very interesting. The garlic fries were great as everyone else mentioned. I ordered the brat with sauerkraut. The brat was just weird and dry. Nothing that reminded me of a German brat. The sauerkraut was extremely weird. I have never seen anything like that in my life. I even took a bit of the kraut alone just to see how it tasted. Didn't taste anything like kraut and I was disappointed. I only ate about 3/4 of my brat and that was enough disappointment. They need to fix this.  If you've been to Germany and even lived there, you may be disappointed."}
{"text":"The beer selection is amazing.  That said, worst service I've ever had ever. The wait staff was actually rude.  For the first time in my life we actually cancelled the order and left.  Never again.  Btw don't try to move a stool 3 ft left. You'll be attacked by the gestapo."}
{"text":"All the things that are great about having a currywurst, like a quality sausage with a nice crisp skin and good curry sauce, with a nice beer garden atmosphere."}
{"text":"If there's German food or beer in the Phoenix area, you better bet your bottom dollar I'll know about it.   I came here the day after it had opened and it was pretty slammed but we only had to wait about 20 minutes for a seat. While we waited, we were able to go over to the bar area and get ourselves a beer. The beer list is so great, it took me 5 minutes to decide which one to get first. I started with a Bell's draft for the wait (I know, I know - getting an American beer at this place? But Bell's is the bees knees and not many places have them on draft so Brat Haus gets a big star for that).   Once we got seated, the waiter came over and was extremely friendly and attentive. Every time I go to a restaurant shortly after they open, there's usually always some hiccups - spotty service, out of certain menu items, etc., but that wasn't the case at all! Everything seemed to be running smooth like they'd been open for months already.   I got the spicy brat and the #5 Hefe for dinner. We also split fries and the pretzel. Hands down best pretzel I've ever had!   The ambiance is great, they have a beer menu to make even the most decisive person become an indecisive little girl, and the menu makes me want to keep coming back until I try everything.   Go here."}
{"text":"Dining at Brat Haus was a very positive experience. Warm and welcoming atmosphere. Quick and efficient service. Cold, yummy beer and cider out of the tap. The pretzel with beer cheese sauce was something I would eat every day, all day. The bratwurst is delightful no matter what flavor you choose. Try the onion jam as a topping you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Since opening a few years back, Brat Haus has always been one of my favorite places in old town.  My boyfriend and I are regulars here and not only is there food great, but they also have an exceptional rotating beer list.   I also love that they have happy hour everyday, even on weekends and their outdoor area is amazing & includes ping pong, giant jengas, and bean bags."}
{"text":"The spicy pepper jack brat was ridiculously bland, not spicy whatsoever, not cheesy. I was looking for big bold flavors but the brat fell short. The bread was delicious. Crunchy on the outside soft on the inside. The Bloody Mary that a customer posted on Yelp posted a picture with a sausage as a garnish-- mind did not :( but it was very good.  my moms salad was probably the best part. With a place that has \"brat\" in the name. I expected way better."}
{"text":"Cool spot for some beers, especially if you like German beer! I was hoping there would be a bunch of people outside in the bier garden like I've seen in pictures and heard people talk about, but there wasn't a single person out there (maybe because it was pretty cold out for AZ). Instead, everyone was inside in the bru house, we sat at the bar & watched some football (they have 1 small TV in the corner) & drank a beer. I would come back, probably when the weathers better to sit outside in the bier garden area!"}
{"text":"Finally got back out to Brat Haus... One of my favorite food spots. Great beer list and awesome food. Not your normal backyard BBQ brats... All kinds of special meats and combinations...definitely need to step outside your comfort zone and try a specialty brat. Tons of toppings and beers to compliment the flavors.   The pretzels are always one of our starters... Little hard which I like for a bit more crunch. Good assortment of mustards, cheeses and even some Nutella for dipping.   Always finish with Drunken Date Cake... Sweet an savory... Never disappoints.   Chill, fun place that you can hit up frequently and not get tired of."}
{"text":"Went on a bar crawl this last weekend for a friend's birthday. Captain John was an excellent host and was very entertaining the whole way through! Very knowledgeable about Old Town Scottsdale and I learned a few new fun facts, all while getting some great exercise and having a blast!! :)"}
{"text":"Good service  Good food  I had a spicy brat and an order of poutine.  Both we good.  I was disappointed with the poutine in that it was not a true brown gravy like I am used to from trips to Canada but it was still good.  The variety of mustards and ketchups they bring to the table are also a nice touch.  I used the YELP coupon for the free Nutella when you purchase a pretzel.  Oh yah!  Very tasty."}
{"text":"Where do I start?   Really awesome patio that can accommodate both large and small groups. The high top tables are a little uncomfortable and if you're tall no chance of sitting there.   The beer menu is tremendous. You really can't go wrong with anything. Ask your waiter/waitress for recommendations on pairing beer with your food.   The brat was fantastic. The bun was toasted to perfection and the toppings were all fresh. If you like spicy throw some Dijon mustard on it. Your mouth will be on fire."}
{"text":"If you order a \"Black & Tan\" isn't that more beer than foam? Then when you ask about it your told to let it sit. We have tried this house 3 times now and there's not going to a fourth. Went for they're 5th year anniversary and won't go back.  Food is ok, they let you sit with someone else's dog( dog friendly) is not my thing. And for a brought worst at $9.00 I think you'd show up better."}
{"text":"ZOMG!  My cousins booked this place for a rehearsal dinner for a wedding.  Outdoor picnic tables with streamed lights, a wall to spray paint lurve on and the food!  First of all, they catered to our Serbian heritage and made bop chichi.  It was excellent along with roasted chicken, potato schmaltz, salad and the spiciest brats I have ever had.  The dessert also followed Serbian tradition with date cake.  The staff bent over backward in service of drinks.  Beer was tapped, and the wait staff was constantly asking if we wanted wine or any other hard liquor served in glass outdoors.  The setting was perfect for mingling of out of town guests with the wedding families.  It was a wedding in itself.  PS Did I mention the pretzels and pickle appetizers!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of beer but I do like a good beer brat - go figure. Considering there is not another brat place in town (that I know of anyway) the boyfriend and I were happy to find out about Brat Haus.   On a Saturday night we took a seat on the Brat Haus patio. the seating is a little weird. There are a few long group tables, a few individual tables and then a lot of empty space. It wasn't super busy which made the empty space seem even more, well, empty. Kinda weird.  We each ordered a traditional beer brat with root beer onions and an order of pretzels to share. The pretzels came out first. Man, those are some girthy pretzels. Not sure if they are whole wheat but they are much heartier that what you get at Auntie Anne's that's for sure. They came with 3 types of mustard and a beer cheese sauce. The cheese sauce was just okay. It was kinda thin and a little bland. The waitress did ask our opinion though and we told her what we thought. It was nice to know they are open to improvements and want customer feedback.  Next up were the brats. They are huge! After the filing pretzels we could have easily shared one brat. The bun was more like french bread, which made for a little too much bread around the meat. But i will say I'm not a big fan of onions and I really like the root beer onions. It was a very nice complement to the brat. The brat itself was good, not amazing but good. It also came with a few pickled green beans which were a surprising nice flavor combination with the meat.   Overall the staff was very nice, the food was decent and in the winter I think it'll be a great place to hang out outside. If you like beer and brats it's worth stopping by."}
{"text":"I rarely write a review, but I'm a bit drunk and the food was delicious so here I go! I had the Jamaican jerk chicken sausage brat with pickled peppers along with fries, Siracha aioli and a black IPA. Basically I need to come back immediately and order the same thing! The brat was flavorful and spicy and the peppers were vinegary and delicious. The IPA was top notch. The waitress was sassy and ballsy which i adore. I will definitely be back with my husband and friends. Seems to be a kid friendly and dog friendly place on the patio as well, if you like that sort of thing. Sad I waited so long to try this place."}
{"text":"We had a real fun lunch here. The place reminds me of a ski lodge, very German feeling. They have a slew of good beers. Imagine a place with everything house-made including the ketchup and mustards! The Belgian Fries were super, they could have been served a little fresher but as a whole they were really solid. We tried two of the brats, the bread they serve them on was some of best bread I have ever had. It kicked everything up a notch! Our server was young and did a good job. She also offered up a good spot for us to continue exploring the town when we finished our drinks and lunch."}
{"text":"We came in with a party of 15. The food was delicious, drinks were perfect and service is on point. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection, warm atmosphere, ping pong, giant jenga, Odell, New Belgium, beer garden,and more! What else could you want in a bar? I studied abroad and had the chance to go to a couple German restaurants that had beer gardens, and this restaurant definitely brought back those memories. It's a close second to the real thing."}
{"text":"We have been to the Braut Huas twice. Both times were good experiences.  The staff and manaent were both very attentive but not overbearing. Had the hot italian the seco d night with Sauerkraut. Some of the best kraut Ive ever had.  Live music on Saturday wiyh a terrific duo from The Sugar Thieves.  We will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"Ate here after our Tour De Tavern bike ride and it was great. They do have things other than brats (thank goodness, I'm not a brat fan!) like the BBQ ribs (YUM!) and Santa Maria Tri Tip Sandwich was excellent also. Several pretzel items that looked great as well. Service was great and it was SO nice to sit outside in perfect weather. They have a giant Jenga game, cornhole etc. Fun vibe and decent prices."}
{"text":"The brats were pretty tasty, though there are better more flavorful available.  The buns are not quite right.  We tried one of the pretzels and while the mustard was spot on the first pretzel wasn't cooked right and the chef disposed of it and brought us a new one.  The new one was only marginally better.  Should have been softer with a nice crust and sea salt on top... big disappointment there.  Also the price, was an issue for the the money you should get a side dish, frys, potato salad, something to lessen the kick in the pants."}
{"text":"It must be our third or fourth time here. We come here mainly for the atmosphere, very relaxed, nice patio/backyard. The beer selection is pretty big, they have my favorite beer \"Framboise\"! We came with our puppy and unfortunately, they didn't want us to sit where the mist were.. For some reason. We were able to sit in the shade but it was still very hot. We love their fries, their Hush Hush sauce is really nice, and you have to try their Curry Ketchup, it is personally my favorite. We are looking forward to the Oktoberfest, it is going to be so much fun!"}
{"text":"I am giving this four star rating for one reason, the bartender named Matt. If that is not his name I will correct it when I go back. And I will. My issues are: very little seating in \"cool bar area\", and the fact that people, who I think were owners, kept setting things on the counter where I was sitting. Some lady was yelling on the phone next to us in the dining area (sigh) for most of our stay. My food was forgotten in the kitchen, we got wings. They are made with siriachi and actually were very good for being barely warm. We got a bacon blue cheese dressing with them that was excellent. Worth coming back for was watching one amazing man make like a million drinks at full speed with no flaws. And he tastes them all, the sanitary way (don't worry) so that you will be sure o get a great drink. He helped us pick beers that we liked, and he was spot on. I would go every night to watch him. Seriously. Give that man a raise!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. And the customer service was awesome. Next time we come in I'm going to try the flights."}
{"text":"I went here solely for the pretzel and it did not disappoint! Soft and heavy just like it should be! Big fan.  Side Note: my server was familiar with their taps, made a couple of recommendations based upon my tastes and then gave me samples of each. Nice job."}
{"text":"We have given Brat Haus several tries over the last couple of months so this review is overdue but it is also representative of what is consistently good and what needs work.   We love the food choices and the beer selection!!  So many options and they change seasonally so we don't get into a rut.  Keep that up! What needs work is the service.  Each time service has been slow and items are always missing.  One time the check even came slow so others in our party had to leave and we had to stay and keep waiting!  Each time we have been there the restaurant has not been full so it's hard to say it was because of that!  On the last visit we were with a large group so the 20% was auto added so we felt shortchanged on service in this case.   We will try again because we love your food and beers....... please help with the service And you will be awesome!"}
{"text":"Good food and I like the atmosphere.  My waitress sucked tho.  I think she forgot about us.  I've been twice and the first time was great but the service the second time was bad."}
{"text":"Awesome concept.  All six of the sauces are great.  Good beer.  Nice patio.  The brats are a bit on the peppery side.  German potato salad was a hot preparation - I was expecting the cold version with radishes and vinegar (no mayonnaise), but, it was good.  Pretzel was pretty basic."}
{"text":"What do we love about the Brat Ha√ºs.. what don't we love. You know we are all about the love of great food and fun times and places we love to hang out with friends and the Brat Ha√ºs certainly fits the bill. The patio is superb and has all the things you love to do with friends, a huge Jenga block, tetherball, ping pong, cornhole... all in one of the best hidden patios in Old Town. Want a place to ride your bikes too, hang out and enjoy a great afternoon... no problem, this is your place. The Brat Ha√ºs makes you feel right at home the moment you walk across the giant logo on the floor and it never stops until you walk out the door.

{"text":"Love the Brat Haus. Great beer selection, relaxed vibe, good food, just a really nice atmosphere...  ...BUT, do not do the pig roast they offer for large parties. Not at all worth what they charge for it, and frankly not that good. We were served frigid cuts of pork from a pig that was supposedly roasted just for us (we never saw it, so with the flavor and temperature we guessed it was left overs from someone else's party). Yes, it was served almost refrigerator cold. It's served on mashed potatoes and mixed veggies that tasted like they came from a can. Just completely disappointing. At $50/person my big group was hoping for a fun, unusual, communal experience, but man, it was like a bad school lunch. Not one person in our party of 25 enjoyed it.  Again, I highly recommend the Brat Haus for just about everything else. But I just feel like I have to comment on the pig roast."}
{"text":"The only time we went was for the Brat Fest but it was great. I hope we can visit again soon. The brats are amazing and the pretzel is to die for. My family loved being able to play the games outside and enjoy the weather."}
{"text":"Yep. Mcallister was our server and absolutely killed it. They pulled up the smoker lid and showed us the goods....outstanding environment with a great patio, good low-level and upbeat music as we came in Friday around 2. I'll definitely be back with groups of people to show this place off. I can only imagine that's it's a well lit nighttime patio and can only get better. Foodwise??? Everything! And I really can say enough about the service.. For those that have been to the old oregano's in old town scottsdale, it's in that spot."}
{"text":"Really a great place, with great beer. Brat Haus also has terrific food too. As I'm a two timer and been here twice, I'm now an expert.   Firstly they have great, great fries, secondly their sausage plate is out of this world. It was so good I had to order two of them. The fries are just like Belgium fries, meaning excellent.   The first time I was here I had the boar brat, yes it was heavy, but it was very good.  I really like the ambiance and the service. Spencer did a great job."}
{"text":"Yay!  I love this place!!  The decor is not only stylish and unique, but pretty much useful. I love the ammo bins on wheels to sent condiments and napkins to the other members of your party. The rest of the interior design is great also. However, I do wonder if women had any input as the chairs have no backs and there are no purse hooks. Which means, my purse goes on the floor or the table. Either one is not appropriate.   However, the food was amazing. And I'm German. I started off with the basics. A pretzel and cheese. Beer brat.  WITH ROOTBEER ONIONS. And beer. And strudel. And I didn't get hungry again until the next morning (and that was lunch).   I really appreciated that the food was served on metal trays. It gave a little bit of extra flair. And I give extra points for the way management handled the patrons beside us that started off with a compliment and quickly turned to complaints.  The service was a little slow for being lunch on a weekday, and there were no purse hooks. So I'll be back, but will probably only bring my wallet in. Like a guy."}
{"text":"Phenomenal. The people who did Brat Haus and Taco Haus just know their damn stuff.   BEST thing you can order is the brat flight, $12 bucks for three different brat samplings and three different beer samplings. You have to love the 5 variations of mustard on every table + curry ketchup. Awesome wait staff. Soo so good."}
{"text":"Second visit!  We couldn't wait to get back here since discovering it on our trip to Scorrsdale last year!  We actually almost ordered the same thing again, since it was so delicious last year.  We started with the in-house made pretzel and cheese dip, and I had a Chimay Cinq Cents and my wife ordered the Wethenstephan hefe since she likes lighter beers.  Both were miraculous to me!  We then followed up with ordering the brat flight, three mini sliders on buns including the Haus brat, topped with sauerkraut, the spicy brat topped with root beer sauteed onions, and the sweet brat topped with spicy red peppers.  Add one of the many choices of mustards in the six pack we had on our table, and you have perfection!  The flight included 4 oz. beers to accompany each slider, and all were perfect pairings.  The bartender Judy had the dining room and bar all to herself and she was friendly, warm and attentive and it was amazing to watch her multi-task.  One again a visit to the Brat Haus was a highlight of our vacation and since we are staying in the area for two weeks once again, we will probably be back next week!  So different and fun with all of the beer and brat choices!  We went early so parking on the street was easy.  (Last year we had a hike going later at night and had to park around the corner illegally 8-})"}
{"text":"Amazing pretzels! And the cheese sauce?! So good! It was too hot to sit in the beer garden, unfortunately, but the atmosphere inside was casual and relaxed.   Our server was excellent--very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. Two of us went with his recommendations on the brats, and they didn't disappoint.  This is a great place to meet up with friends over a cold beer and good eats!"}
{"text":"Oktoberfast Eternal!!  In and outdoor seating/biergarten. Outdoor bargames, great service and fun atmosphere. Lots of draft and bottled beers.  The schnitzel was flattened, crispy, gravied goodness. Its served with fries, some with skin on. The all beef Haus brat in bun topped with a plethora of toppings, but tonight it was saurkraut. Pal had a hard time fitting the whole shibang in his mouth. There are 6 types of mustards and ketchup. My fave was the curry ketchup.  Prost!!"}
{"text":"Amazing beer list. Finally a place that has an extensive list and one that changes frequently. The brats are beyond those you'll find elsewhere. These are gourmet brats and a huge selection of toppings. The patio is fantastic and they hav a variety of games includng a lifesize Jenga set. on Sundays you can get a pitcher, a brat and watch a movie outside for $20!"}
{"text":"All house-made, super fresh ingredients, local and all the other food-buzz-words you can think of. Also, one of the best pretzels I've had outside of Germany... Oh yeah, and they have about one Bazillion beers on tap. You just cannot go wrong here; you can't."}
{"text":"I went here twice in a weekend, after never going before.  Huge caveat: this is not a place to go if you want something upscale and chic. This is not someplace you bring your fussy grandma. This is not someplace you'd enjoy if you don't like meat and beer.  But I do enjoy meat and beer, so I really enjoyed Brat Haus.  What I enjoyed most is their beer selection. It's truly one of the best in the Valley. Their staff is incredibly knowledgeable, which is a must with such an exotic beer list. A problem, sometimes, with these sorts of places is that they're snooty and the staff can be heavy on the beer knowledge, and light on the service quality.  Not here. I went first with just me and my date, and all of our food and drinks arrived promptly. The second night, it was much more crowded and we were a semi-drunk rowdy group of fourteen. Our waiter dutifully catered to our requests for more and more drinks, and strange customizations to their food. He also had suggestions for us no matter how unspecific we were. I listed off five or so craft beers I enjoyed, and he suggested a dark IPA that I'd order again (and again) given the chance. My date told him about tastes and styles she likes, and he also had a suggestion she liked. Which is impressive, given that she doesn't really like beer.  Their food, by the way, is amazing. I haven't had a brat I haven't loved. Their fries, and the amount of delicious sauces you can have with them, are also worth trying. I had a lamb brat with apricot chutney that was divine, but I was also impressed by my date's original brat and sauerkraut. On the second night, I tried their pretzels (nice and fluffy) and their spicy brat. I was a bit disappointed that it wasn't spicier, but pairing it with toppings heavy on the spice and vinegar pumped it up enough that I was pleased.  My increasingly drunken friends and I also appreciated the amount of party games they have on their patio. We played some hacky-sack hole game (it's probably actually called something officially) and giant Jenga. The Jenga especially was a big hit with our impaired hand-eye coordination.  I'd be tempted to take a star off for the lack of parking, but I'll keep it there because it's Old Town Scottsdale, and parking is sparse everywhere. You can park in the restaurant next door if they're not super crowded (they're terrible, by the way, so you're not missing anything) or down on second street in the lot next the tattoo shop if you don't mind walking half a block.  Also, I can't take a star off a place that managed to completely avoid playing any songs that I hated. Seriously, people, enough with the classic rock Muzak. Sometimes stuff is so inoffensive its offensive."}
{"text":"Great place for Sunday lunch! They have a great beer selection and the brats are fantastic. They have a lot of outside seating and the smell of smoker is wonderful! The service was also wonderful and I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Went for the first time on Saturday night. Having eaten great currywurst in Berlin recently, I thought I'd try their version.  Disappointed.. Sausage was overly spicy and the currywurst sauce was almost non existent. Should have been downing in sauce, not lightly battered in it.  However beers were nice, although minimal selection of traditional German beers. Too much USA-made beer on the menu.  Staff were nice - had a new girl in training who made every effort.  Will go back for a second chance offer to see how they go.  Accordion player was fun - lots of cover songs done in traditional umpah style. Was cool!"}
{"text":"Service is hit or miss. I've had enough rude waitresses to take off a star, but the food really is wonderful. Love the different onion toppings! The beer selection is very limited though. They almost only have cheap ipa's."}
{"text":"Dog friendly, great beer list, and I love that they use their business to host events benefitting local non profits! The patio/bier garden is awesome and a great place to sit outdoors any time of the year."}
{"text":"The service and the restaurant itself is great. The food was not. I got a pretzel and a couple sausages. The pretzel was no different to me than one you might buy at the movie theatre, and even the 4 different kinds of mustard could save that spiceless brat. Sorry guys"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place - I truly did, but alas it was not to be.  I'm not a beer lover - but for those that are - they have about a billion beers to choose from.  I did get some delish hard cider.  They also have unusual bottled sodas which are fun to try.  The bartender/waiter was extra nice - good service and someone you could tell cared about his job.  That was the good... unfortunately - that doesn't include any of the food.  The pretzel with cheese was just ok - didn't taste fresh and soft and the cheese sauce was very heavy on the swiss flavor and kind of bland.  We were excited to try the poutine - and VERY disappointed.  The gravy was bland and you could still taste the flour.  It was basically just a $10+ plate of trash.  Hubby had a brat - which he wasn't really impressed with.  I got the Pig Mac - I did like it but not enough to be able to convince hubs to return.  The inside seating is all high tops - and not particularly comfy.    Bottom line - this isn't a place for us - it's a place for people who love beer and horseshoes and don't mind sitting on uncomfy bar stools.  People for whom the food might be a second thought and maybe have beer goggles on while they are eating."}
{"text":"Definitely a favorite for us!  Great food that rotates new items in to keep the menu different.  The beer selection has a good mixture of brews that aren't just local.  You gotta visit when in Old Town."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but it was a miss... Went here for birthday celebration. Pretzel was tasteless & the cheese sauce was horrible. Everyone said their food was \" okay.\" Not sure if it was the server's first ever waitressing gig - but it was bad:("}
{"text":"I really liked the sauerbraten, but the rest of my family wasn't so impressed. Mind you, we're from Chicago. The schnitzel was a little dry (needs a little gravy), the jaeger stew was too vinegary, and the brat burger had lots of herbs but no spice. However, the chicken and waffle (especially the Belgian waffle) was awesome, and the pretzels rule. Try all the mustards, too... I never had whole grain mustard, and I want more!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  They even have a brat for pups, and pups eat free on Sundays!  I usually go with a few beers, the pretzel and cheese and a mini mac or pig mac depending on how hungry I am.  And the brat for the pup.  My little homie is the pickiest dog ever, but he loves those things.  I have the shred it to little pieces so he can eat, but it puts a smile on his face and I just can't say no to the little guy.  And his water bowl comes full of ice water in this desert heat.    If you save three receipts, bring them back for a free pretzel."}
{"text":"So I have to say, business is slow in the summers in AZ, especially restaurants.  I had a couple of friends in from NYC and thought I show them a great place for brew and a brat.  To my disappointment, my cheese board came much later than my friend's meal but to have it arrived after they finished their meal and our drinks.  Come on.. it's not like you had a slew of hot dog connoisseurs in line waiting for the next big wiener.  I felt a bit embarrassed about the whole experience and upset at that so I decided to call the manager the next day. When I spoke to the Manager, he stated he had heard about the feedback and since I'm calling again, I must wanted something for free. WTF, I'm not bitching about a $10 happy hour cheese board but the fact that you have ridiciously slow service and to have that attitude when a customer calls in to let you know their experience.  There's plenty of restaurants in the valley and to tell you the truth, Ted's Hot dogs in Tempe delivers much better food and I can go elsewhere for a cold brew."}
{"text":"That brat burger and pretzel with beer cheese is the killer combo. Great selection on tap. Reason they are 4/5 stars is that they were out of the first 3 beers I wanted to try the other day. The service is a bit slow sometimes as well."}
{"text":"Big portion fries! Definitely need to share with someone else. Samplers are all really good."}
{"text":"At the Brat Haus, I like their beer more than their food.  They have a great selection of beers and some nice German options, too.  The food, however, is either average or subpar.  First, I wanted to order a variety of their sliders, but was told that I had to choose one variation.  Why?  They give you four sliders, so just charge me $10 or whatever and let me select a combination of BLT, beef, and green chile chicken!  Bastards...  Since my first request was denied, I decided to order The Pig Mac with bacon and an egg.  The Pig Mac is a double cheeseburger with a pork sausage patty, a ground beef patty and the usual filler.  It was enormous, messy, and a chore to eat.  Even after squishing it down, I still couldn't fit my mouth around this thing.  I was forced to chop it up into smaller pieces and then had to daintily eat around the pink or undercooked parts of the pork patty.  I didn't get sick afterwards, so I guess I will survive, but I really, really, REALLY hate eating pink meat.  It would have been nice if they allowed their customers the ability of choosing how they want their meat cooked.  Brat Haus had just cooked a pig, so a couple people in my party decided to try that.  It didn't look very good and one guy even stopped eating it.    This guy requested some crispy skin and about 15-20 minutes later they brought out some \"chicharrones.\"  I have never tried this stuff and I am glad I haven't, because I wouldn't have any teeth left.  I took a little bite and nearly chipped a tooth...and it tasted awful.  Blech.  Who eats this stuff?  Really the only thing that they did well was the beer and a nutella milkshake that I ordered.  Please God don't have my friends take me to this place again..."}
{"text":"Only here once, but will definitely be back.    The food was good.  4 stars.    This place would be MUCH busier if they had happy hour on the weekend.  MUCH BUSIER!  If fact, I would probably be a regular.    They have a great beer selection.  Staff was okay.   They did a great job of creating a fun environment in the back.  They have darts, washers, tetherball, jenga, ping pong, etc.  It seems like a great place to hang out.  The real negative here is that they make it a little too kid-friendly.  I wanted to try out all of the fun things in the back, but too many kids were out there just running around and hogging the ping pong table.  Not cool for people wanting to have fun and a few drinks.  I'm certain they would make more profit from selling more cocktails instead of milkshakes.   Either way, I'll be back.  - UPDATE -   I appreciate being contacted regarding my review.  I always try to be honest and fair.  I was told that kids usually clear out by 8pm.  However, as a long time Old Town resident, I know that Old Town is a day drinking location.  ESPECIALLY with the locals.  Locals like to enjoy their city by heading out early around 10am, start with a bloody, have cocktails and food throughout the day, enjoy the outdoor bar patios, and be home by 6pm.  That's just how we locals do it...  Old Town residents practically have it mastered.    My visit here seemed like I was trying to enjoy a beer in the sun in the middle of grade school recess.  Kids were running around, being loud and crazy like kids do I guess.    Just my two cents.  But of course I'll be back to try it again."}
{"text":"BOO-MOTHERFUCKIN-YA! Found out about this place and the first thing I thought was, \"why have I not been there yet?\". Made it over last night and had an awesome time. They've done a really excellent job with the indoor and outdoor spaces, and the restaurant is really well put together. Great concept start to finish.   The brats were excellent. We had the spicy, the beer, and the duck. All great. But the most impressive thing in my view was the beer selection. Great belgian and german  beers to choose from, and some excellent USofA selections as well. Great beers, great price point.   DId I mention that they serve a freaking boot of beer too? AWESOME! I will most definitely be coming back here to get loaded on huge Spaten's and great house made brats."}
{"text":"Great place in old town Scottsdale for a beer and pretzel.  We sat inside which was a bit loud, but the waiter/bartender made up for it by actually being nice and spoke up.  We had the pretzel fundio (w/cheese). His was great match it wi their home made mustard pure awesomeness.  The main course, wife had the spicy brat with kraut, I had the Morracan with root beer onions.  Hers, very flavorful not very spicy but all around good flavor.  And with the home made kraut we will be back.  Mine, the brat was a very good flavors mixed with the grain mustard was very good.  The root beer onions tasted very good but got to be a bit to sweet for my taste.  To wash it all down you can choose from a good selection of \"motherland\" beers.  Great food and service.  Cost is a bit on the pricey side but for the quality, while not a regular stop it is on our repeat list."}
{"text":"This Brat Haus has a very \" Gem√ºtlichkeit \" vibe ! The friendliness and good cheer is ever present at this establishment. Our server Victoria was on point and suggested the new holiday \" Mayflower Brat\" This brat was everything wonderful about Thanksgiving on a bun! Pumpkin spiced pork and turkey brat made with Fall spices, brown sugar, vanilla , allspice and butternut pumpkin squash topped with noble bread chicken liver stuffing,mushroom gravy and cranberry relish. Victoria also brought the truffle aioli to accompany the dish..FANTASTIC! We also found out you can have a party catered or do a whole pig roast with a work group or a gaggle of buddies.. How cool is that? The weekly specials Monday ( Happy Hour all day!!! ) Tuesday ( Tacos) Wednesday ( Burgers & bikes) etc.....Huge beer selection. There is a big outside area that is kid & dog friendly . The t-shirts are pretty funny & hold up really well! check out this spot, worth the trip!"}
{"text":"First time... just before ordering food at Happy Hour, witnessed an employee check a guests plate for \"heat\" and grabbed a bite to check the food before \"okaying\" it and sending it to table."}
{"text":"Was not impressed at all. Been waiting to go to this place for awhile now because I'm an avid german food lover. I ordered the schnitzel and it comes out in 3 smaller pieces instead of one big piece like its supposed to and i felt as if i were back in elementary school getting those generic chicken patty sandwhiches. I also asked the waitress for alot of lemon because thats how i eat my schnitzel. She comes back with 4 lemon wedges. I use all the wedges in a matter of a minute and i ask for more and the waitress got a bit snippety. Not to mention she never ever refilled our glasses. She came by about 4 times after we got our meal and never addressed our empty glasses. Also got the garlic fries with ranch. Terrible decision. They were literally average fries with chopped garlic clove on top. Absolutely no taste other than the garlic burn when i got a chunk of it in my mouth. The ranch dip was absolutely disgusting. Didnt even taste like ranch. In fact everyone in my party ordered a different sauce and they were all bad. The aioli and blu cheese bacon sauces were atrocious. A few people ordered the schnitzel sandwhich and they said it was really nothing special. Could've made a better sandwhich at home. The only decent item was Das Brat and thats giving it the benefit of the doubt. The only reason I'm  giving this a second star is because i got full off it."}
{"text":"Guess I've never reviewed this place before? The hubby and I met up with some friends early on a Saturday night for dinner. It was around 6pm, before it started getting too rowdy... Brat Haus is unfortunately in that part of Old Town (right next door to Salty Senorita) where all the ASU kids come to drink on weekends. Anyway, we had some tasty food and Oktoberfest beers and a great time. My friend and I got the restaurant week special which came with 1 appetizer so of course we got the pretzel and cheese, my favorite. Then we also each got a bratwurst.. I think these were supposed to come with fries but our waiter was super swamped and forgot. Then we also got one each of the two desserts they offer. Bratwurst was delicious but nobody really liked the desserts much. This was not a bad deal at $30 for all that food. My hubby got the ribs plate and my friends hubby got the pig roast plate and those were $20 each which I don't think is that great of a deal. I think the brats are their best offering so it's usually a good idea to stick with that.  Really, the appeal of Brat Haus is their huge patio. When the weather is nice it can't be beat. It's a great place to come and enjoy a few beers... play some tetherball or jenga... whatever floats your boat. This month for Oktoberfest they even had an oompah band!"}
{"text":"We will definitely try them out again. State Fair Cheese Curds are a must! Each of us tried a different grilled sausage on a French roll. Excellent! My sister tried her's Charcuterie style and thoroughly enjoyed it. Next time we'll do the Brat & Beer Flight. The only thing negative from our experience was the fresh squeezed lemonade. When my husband and I were served it, it tasted like it was going bad. We brought it to the server's attention, so she checked on it for us. She came back and told us that we'd need to order something else to drink because they wouldn't be making another batch until the following day. So I question how fresh it is. Then they were running low on their bottled sodas due to some event they had, so it took a few requests to finally get something to drink. Nothing that will keep us away. I just think next time we'll stick with beer."}
{"text":"As we headed to this restaurant the tune from the '80s song \"Our House\" by Madness floated through my head but with the lyrics below:  Brat Haus... In the middle of 2nd St. Brat Haus...  (OK so it's actually south of 2nd St. on Scottsdale Rd. but my brain likes to take creative license on reality, especially when directions are involved).  Quite honestly Brat Haus wasn't our first choice. We were going to go to Rehab Burger but there was a 45 min to 1 hour wait to get a table. Whaaaat? On a Wednesday night? At 6 P.M.? Then I realized it was Spring Training time which made a lot more sense.   Anyways, Brat Haus, despite being our little silver medal of restaurants, ended up being a wonderful choice for dinner. There was no wait and we were seated quickly. We shared some appetizers and I ordered the Das Fire, their spiciest sausage on the menu, in sandwich form.  Our appetizers were a large portion and excellent. The pretzel ($6) was perfectly cooked with a well balanced beer-cheese dip. The poutine ($12) was a huge plate of fries soaked in thick brown gravy with battered and fried cheese curds and pork belly. Salty, fatty, starchy Canadian inspired goodness, eh?  My Das Fire sausage ($10) had a mixture of habanero, green chile, and jalape√±o in it. Our server warned me it was spicy but I said I was up for the challenge! It was a medium-hot level of spiciness for me, almost spicy enough to make my nose run but not quite. I got it with the root beer onions ($1 extra) which were very potent and strong flavored against the savory, fiery flavor of the sausage. I appreciated the huge mound of onions with it, but I probably would have preferred a mix of root beer onion with another condiment to balance out the flavor a little more (Now I know for next time). The only slight negative for me was that the casing didn't have a good \"snap\" to it when I bit into it, so with some bites I really had to work my teeth into the sausage to tear off a chunk with the sandwich bread.  Service was good and drinks were refilled as needed.  While we ate inside today since it was getting chilly, I'd definitely like to come here again to dine at their dog friendly patio and perhaps order a special dog brat for my four legged friends."}
{"text":"Meh. I get the novelty of the place, but it just wasn't for me. I would say a little overpriced, but location location location. I would charge the same for that area. People will pay it so why not charge it. We are outside and it was a nice atmosphere, but that wasn't enough for me. I had a brat and it was decent, but to be honest I've had better that I've made myself. The hamburger order was wrong that they brought me the first time. They brought me the right burger and it was decent, but not worth the price tag. Their garlic fries on the other hand were pretty delicious."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Pros: Great location in Old Town, fun patio with a good setup, with games (holy board, ping pong, jenga), very nice craft beer selection.   Cons: expensive food even by Old Town standards.  $16 for an ala carte footlong brat that was skinny, overcooked and not juicy (well seasoned though).  Slow, disinterested server and what seemed like uncoordinated management.  Their patio is a good place to be on an 80 degree Saturday afternoon, so we'll try some other menu items and hope the servers are a bit more motivated and happy"}
{"text":"Fun place, I love as looking for something different and fun to enjoy lunch. Drove by this place in Old Town Scottsdale and just had to stop. You can sit outside which there are games and a great atmosphere or sit inside where it's inviting and friendly place to watch a game. Had the sampler of Brats and if never been here before its a great place to start. Service was young and friendly, parking can be a hassle but walking through old town isn't a bad place to be."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends, and I have to say that I was really impressed! The atmosphere was good, the food was tasty, and the price was reasonable (food was pretty high quality, but there is the \"Scottsdale markup\" at play too).   I got the Sonoran and it was really good! I'd recommend it for sure."}
{"text":"Very tasty! I got takeout, pepper jack braut. Don't get the spicy mustard, it's horseradish dyed yellow. Root beer onions were super good though"}
{"text":"This is a great place! Fun patio with giant Jenga, ping pong, and corn hole.  Service was great...well, we chatted it up a little too much because my wife ended up getting the wrong sausage, and I was missing a topping but she made great suggestions and was friendly and did what she was supposed to do. She offered to get my wife another link. We found out after we got the bill that it was a sausage we had joked about so honest mistake. They games make it kid friendly, the portions make Dad finish the rest of kids dog. Did I mention the beers are plentiful? Loved this as Oregano's but this place is better for sure...in a different way!"}
{"text":"I'm glad to see that Chef Payton Curry was able to take his knowledge from working at various establishments around the valley (I fondly remember his time at Caffe Boa) and produce one exceptional eating establishment. I went here on a Friday, with my gang of regulars, who are one picky bunch, and they LOVED this place. The wait person knew her stuff, the service was quick and overall, the food was wonderful.   We started out with a pretzel and unlike what I get when I went to to Handlebar Grill, which are more like pretzel rolls, this was a real pretzel, though it seems made with whole wheat instead of white flour but got a big thumbs up from my culinary focus group. Even better, the establishment makes their own sauces and mustards so along with the obligatory beer cheese I had a wonderful whole grain mustard to use as well so it was like being back in Germany!  I and another person went for the lamb sausage and it was great! It was a good size and nestled in a chunk of soft  and chewy french bread, and I topped it with more of that wonderful mustard, along with sauerkraut and spicy peppers. The nice thing, the sausage was cooked but not overcooked so it was still juicy and it had a strong lamb flavor. As I noted before, unlike a softer bun the french roll bread held together to the end. Another person at my table had the rabbit sausage and said it was great and the last, the last person was a vegetarian and had the black bean burger and boy, it looked excellent! I would love to try that, once I've made it through all the sausages on the menu!  The only thing that stood out as needing work was what was referred to as Belgian fries, which are generally thick cut and twice fried for a crispy outside and creamy interior but these were more like shoe string fries. Chef Payton, work on those fries! if the fries rise to the level of actual Belgian fries I will happily give this place five stars. In this case, the Brat Haus may want to go check out the fries at Handle Bar and Grill, which are closer, from my perspective, to actual Belgian fries.  Bottom line, to quote the Terminator, I'll be back and next time, not on a work day so I can check out the beer selection I see so many other people raving about! :-)  By the way, if you like the sausages you can buy fresh ones to take home so you can grill your own."}
{"text":"In a sea of douchey Old Town bars, Brat Haus is my life raft. The beer selection is tremendous, the owner is chill, the staff mostly is down to earth, and the pretzels are killer.  Two warnings:   1. You're probably gonna sit outside. There isn't a ton of indoor seating.  2. Avoid the poutine. I had it last night and still have a sodium hangover. It's all salt and meat. The cheese curds are fried. The fries are stale. Just don't."}
{"text":"Beer selection is OK and the pretzels are good.   Atmosphere is great.  I think it would be be a great happy hour spot, though they could use a larger appetizer selection.     Food however is definitely not representative of good German food, or food in general.    Pretty certain the schnitzel is from frozen and sides like sauerkraut leave a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place to anyone for food, honestly. Both food and service is mediocre. I went in alone and didn't have anyone wait on me so i went up to the bar and asked to order. i also asked for a glass of water and had to ask a second time before actually getting it. For some reason the server made my food to go  too. So my polish sausage was cold when i got it and in a box i didn't ask for. Also i had to get up and find napkins on my own. I don't know what his problem was cuz it wasn't even busy in there. And it would be not so bad if he had been more friendly but i even overheard him being kind of rude to other customers. he just was not very warm or welcoming.. And who knows maybe he had a stressful day but jeeeez what terrible service! especially for a part of scottsdale that's supposed to be all hip and fancy.  He was a blonde-ish, long haired guy.   Food was not very good for just a hotdog for $10! sorry but i just haven't been impressed with this place (came once before with some friends and wasn't impressed then either).   Must be their beer keeping them together???"}
{"text":"This review is just for the food since we did not drink when we were there.  As a place to drink beer, this is probably a decent spot, but we were joining friends later for drinks so we only drank water with our meal.  The haus brat was nothing to write home about----it was surprisingly average at best.  When I grill a sausage at home it has much more flavor than what I got here.  And for the life of me I could not taste the \"Haus Bacon\" supposedly in the German Potato Salad.  It was pleasant outside for conversation until the live accordion player began----it wasn't his accordion that made it difficult to talk over, it was the loud amplified bass that he played with so he had to amplify too.  Did it ever occur to anyone that an unamplified solo accordion would be a nice background to conversation rather than a thumping bass which forces everyone to talk louder?  They have a customized ping pong table that look pretty cool.  If we ever come back it will be just to have a pint or two.  I'm not sure what is so \"artisanal\" about dry brats."}
{"text":"Went on the first Friday it felt cool enough to sit outside.    Spacious patio, good beer selection.  The menu is, as expected, centered around German style sausages.   Had the currywurst, was very tasty--sliced chunks of sausage prepped in curry (i.e. German curry ketchup).      Limited parking on the street."}
{"text":"The best part about this place was the atmosphere. We sat outside and the misters were running during the 110-degree evening. We brought family from out of town and sat down in time to grab up a couple happy hour specials (brat burger for $6 and the fried pickles for $4). They also have the HUGE pretzel for $15 (instead of $20) $1 off draft beers and some other deals.   We got a regular pretzel, fried pickles, falafel pita, lamb brat, salad and brat burger for 3 adults + 2 kids. It was the perfect amount of food, as our kids eat hardly nothing. Kid meals do exist for about $7/each.   The backyard patio area has bags, a chalkboard wall and a bunch of 2x4 Jenga blocks the kids loved playing with. We had a leisurely chat at our table as they ran around playing with other kids who congregated around the play area. Getting there early meant the place had families and happy hour specials, so that's definitely the only time I'd ever want to be there.  Overall, the food was good, but nothing majorly exciting to report except maybe the freebie honey mustard condiment we had on our table. It was less sweet and more spicy, just the way I like it. Otherwise, the rest was just sustenance. What really was awesome about the place, however, was the ambiance. We had a great time, but our kids had an even better time."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  Can't say enough good things about this place--the food (Haus brat), the staff, the casual outdoor area, the welcome for our 10 month old Mini Schnauzer, and the beer!!  Can't wait to come again."}
{"text":"Craft beer bar with very good beer selection, cool vibe, nice people and solid food.  Extensive selection of beer, both on draft and in bottles/cans.  I was in search of a sour beer and there was a selection to choose from.  Had the pretzel and haus pate.  Big thumbs up to the pretzel but would probably stay away from the pate on the next trip.  It was just OK.  The pretzel was outstanding and the accompanying mustards were varied and flavorful.  Nice people.  Chill vibe."}
{"text":"We had driven past this place sooooo many times simply because we live in Tempe and when we go to Scottsdale to eat we want something on the nicer side but my step-dad decided to have his birthday dinner here and I am SO glad he did. I love brats. I love Belgian style ales. They have a great variety of both. Their lamb and goat currywurst is outta this world!! I love a good currywurst but typically I can only get it in Germany so I was really happy to find that Brat Haus has one and it's fantastic. Not only are they dog-friendly but they even have a pup brat and our pup loved it! We will definitely be back to work our way through the menu. Brat Haus is a must-try."}
{"text":"I had lunch there yesterday, first thing I have to mention is the service. Want to see an employee who acts like an owner meet Judy. She's tending bar, serving tables, cleaning tables, lining up the bar stools, engaging with the customers, knowledgeable, and with the overall feel that she loves what she does. Brat Haus has a winner! Service is just as important as the food. Ask for Judy when you visit.  Crispy baby back ribs...off the charts! Pretzels, pork sliders, brats, pig-tail poutine, and an impressive beer menu make Brat Haus a stand-out!"}
{"text":"Wow, awesome location and who doesn't like brats and beer!  I tried the beer brat with rootbeer sauteed onions. Who knew rootbeer and onions would be a perfect match-Chef Peyton!  The fries were ok, I wasn't a big fan of them but I did like the sauces that came with it.  Great assortment of brews to choose from besides brats.  It's even possible to take the brats home to grill and enjoy.  Love the outside beer garden, this will definitely be one of my hangouts in Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I love the concept, I love the decor, I love the idea, hopefully the food can catch up.   We knew going opening week would be under par as the staff tries to gain their groove, so we went in with I'd say low expectations. We weren't disappointed. Our server knew nothing about the products on the menu or the beverages offered.   My friends each got craft brews and were offered non-chilled glasses, they opted to just drink out of the bottle. I tried the Strawberry fields cocktail. It tasted purely of artificial syrup - nothing fresh about it, and I couldn't tell if the Vodka made it in the glass or not.  We decided to start with the Pretzel and then each opted for different Brats so we could share and get a variety. The pretzel didn't come out till the brats did - so much for ordering an app. When it did finally arrive it was a very dark brown and somewhat mangled look,  we could have gotten past that if it at least tasted good, but not only was this pretzel an eye sore, it was a mouth sore. It was everything you don't want a pretzel to be - tough, chewy and burnt. Finally, the Brats... the Brats themselves weren't bad, but the Brat:Bread Ratio was way off. We received these huge Brat buns that were easily double the size of the actual brat. I wouldn't call myself a Brat aficionado I just can't imagine how you screw up such a simple and easy item - especially if you are the \"Brat Haus\". The one item of the whole evening actually worth noting was the Apricot Chutney, it was flavorful and the only reason I was able to finish my bready meal.   I would be up to giving them another chance, it seems everyone else had a much better experience. I hate to leave bad reviews, but hey, you can't win them all!"}
{"text":"Went here while in Old Town Scottsdale based on the many positive reviews by fellow Yelpers! Having spend 3 years in the brat capital of the world, I know a good one. These are good! What makes it cool is the toppings you get a choice of 2. And then to top it off they have an assortment of ketchup and mustard at the table. Authentic maybe not but good - most definitely! Oh yea, the fries are delicious and the bier (isn't that the most important part)? Many great ones on draft. Was too hot to sit on the HUGE patio in back but the owner (yea he came out), the owner filled us in on live music starting in September and welcomed us back. This ones a keeper for this brat eating, bier loving dude."}
{"text":"Its kind of unfair that Im not leaving 5 stars. I found it weird that my friend wanted to celebrate her birthday at some \"tiny sausage place\" LOL but was shocked to see its actually 2 building with a huge adorable outdoor seating courtyard. Our server was patient and kept coming around to check on us all. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because the food choices are not typically something I would eat. But the ambience is real cool"}
{"text":"Been to Brat Haus at least four times now and each time there is something new to love.  first time -- sat in the Bru Haus with friends and tried some beers we had never had, the fresh-baked, the tasty Belgian fries and a myriad of sausages. we topped off the evening with the crazy insanely delicious date cake.  second time -- brought the teen daughter, who adored the pretzel, loved the brat with the root beer onions and mustard, and stole the entire pretzel.   third time -- stopped by after an unexciting dinner elsewhere we stopped off for pretzels with the ooey gooey fundido and that crazy date cake with caramel sauce. (did i mention that both the cake and caramel have beer in them?)  fourth time -- Oktoberfest! Sat on the patio sunday night and had one of their chewy, salty vegan pretzels, made unvegan by ordering cheese sauce with it, a great pork schnitzel that was topped with an incredible lemon/parsley relish, and a huge pile of German dumplings, spaetzle.  We finished with a pretty darned good apple strudel. Oh, and of course, several rounds of good German beer.  Prost!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out.  We sat in the bar and had awesome service.  Food is AMAZING. outside seating looks great in warmer weather!"}
{"text":"Awesome patio & beer selection last Friday! The patio reminds me of pictures I've seen of beer gardens in Germany. Took advantage of the Yelp check-in freebie and got a soft pretzel with free Nutella dip. Wow! I usually don't like sweets with beer but this was one of the best pretzels I've ever had. Nice dark, chewy crust with melt-in-your-mouth softness inside. Tried the regular brat with sauerkraut topped with whole grain mustard and fries on the side. I am not a big brat eater or even a fan of sausage in general because I don't like running into the unchewable, gristly parts. There was no such thing in this brat! Unfortunately, I chowed down so much during happy hour, I had to go straight home and visit the couch. I would have given them 5 stars but right now with the construction, the parking is a bit of a mess unless you have no problem parking across Scottsdale Road in the lot. Bonus that you can take home brats or pretzels to enjoy later. I hope to go back very soon!"}
{"text":"This place is great every time we go. I'm terrible at choosing a beer when there are so many options but the bartenders are very knowledgeable and help me pick the perfect beer every time. There food is also amazing I get a pretzel with the beer cheese every time no matter and of course you have to get a brat. I like the veal with spicy peppers but the duck and date is also amazing. I don't think I will ever stop liking this place."}
{"text":"For being an old town bar, i find this place to be one of the least douchey. Atmosphere is cool, beers are tasty, staff is well versed on draft selection and make excellent recommendations for the amateur palate. Bartender also had a pretty sweet beard, so they got that going for them. Good job guys! Will be back"}
{"text":"First, let me say, I really wish that I could give this place more than 3 stars.  It is such a cool concept, and the atmosphere is great, but those things don't make a restaurant.  First, though, I will elaborate on my previous statement.  Brat Haus has an awesome outdoor area.  They have large tables, games--including tetherball, which I hadn't seen in years--, and I think they even show movies on the wall sometimes when the weather is nice.  But...  The food, for the most part, is nothing to write home about.  The one thing worth mentioning is the pretzel with beer cheese appetizer-- oh my Lord, it is amazing!  It is even better than the pretzel balls with beer cheese down the street at Culinary Dropout, and I thought nothing would beat that.  Oh, and the fries are pretty good.  Unfortunately, though, that's the best that it gets.  The brats are alright.  Actually, I haven't had many of them, but I wasn't thrilled with the one I had, which was just the basic Haus Brat.  I love both duck and veal, but I was very disappointed that those brats both included fennel.  If you're not familiar with fennel, it tastes like licorice.  It can be good in some dishes, but I don't want it in my brats, so I haven't tried those.    I was very excited to try the schnitzel, but it had no taste-- ZERO.  I had it on a sandwich, and it was alright, but then I took the meat off and tasted it, and it tasted like nothing.  So disappointing.  I've also had the Pig Mac, and it's definitely better than the brats or the schnitzel, but still not something that I crave...and it's ridiculously large.   Finally, I can't not write about how horrible the service was the last time I went there.  Now, I will say, I don't remember the service being so awful on my previous visits.  However, last time, my party and I almost walked out.  The place was next to empty, and it took 15 minutes for the server to bring our drinks, which included 2 sodas and a water!!  That is ridiculous!  Once we got our food, he made very little effort to check on us for the remainder of our time there.  If those pretzels hadn't been so freakin' amazing, we probably would have left.  So, if the weather's nice and you're looking for a cool spot to hang out and drink beer and eat pretzels, then the Brat Haus is probably a safe bet.  Otherwise, I'd skip it."}
{"text":"Such a cool setting!  It's where the old town Oreganos used to be located so I couldn't picture how this restaurant would be laid out.  It's great, the old parking lot is now covered outdoor seating with games.  It's really comfortable and laid back.  The food is great and the pretzels with the beer cheese dip is the BEST!  Highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"A deliciously creative and tasty twist on beer garden fare!  Loved everything about this place. Fun atmosphere, friendly servers and food that makes me want to join an oompah band.  The pretzel and beer cheese dipping sauce were a chewy, savory start to my meal. It was so good I almost ordered another for my main. Thankfully, I resisted the urge, which was a good thing because it left room for the brat sliders, the Belgian fries with blue cheese dipping sauce and the drunken date cake! Luckily I had a 16 oz hard cider to wash it all down with...  This was one of the best casual German dining adventures I have ever had. And that means a lot from a girl named Heidi!"}
{"text":"Food was bland. Service was really slow. And ut was super expensive. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Coooooool place!  I loved it the moment we walked in.  Another late night dinner for us on our road trip, my friend and I found this place in downtown Scottsdale, and enjoyed some tasty beers and dinner with a German flair.  I had the Moroccan lamb brat with sauerkraut and mango chutney upon our server's recommendation- delicious!  Very nice combination of flavors.  I also had a side of Belgian fries with chipotle mayo dip, also very good, nice and crispy on the outside, but thickly cut, and soft and potato-y on the inside.  Portions were big-- I would say you could split a small order of the fries between 2 people and be satisfied. My friend ordered the schnitzel, which came with home fries, so we were not short of taters!  We also had no idea how big everything would be, so we also ordered the beet salad, which they kindly split into 2 portions for us.  This was big too!  Easy to split between 3-4 people if you just want this a small appetizer salad, although I was grateful for the generous portioning, as it was a very nice salad- the beets were sweet and cooked just right, and they had a nice, warm, melty flavor.  Nice ambience outside with the hanging lights.  I really enjoyed our dinner here, and would easily come again if I'm ever in the area to try some other dishes.  Service was top notch, and prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"My first visit to Brat Haus was okay. My next visit (and likely my last) was disappointing to say the least. Inattentive wait staff was the beginning of the drawn out, sub par experience. We had to ask for water 4 times from 3 different people before it actually came out. Wings - $9, extremely small, and you receive only 6 wings. Look, I understanding being in old town scottsdale and charging a premium for food, but that generally comes with expectations of delivering a quality experience. I Ordered the pepper jack brat (recommended by the server) I asked for it extra crispy specifically stating \"I almost want it black\". 1) no pepper jack 2) stale and dry bun 3) It came out the same as everyone else's, not crispy at all.  When I asked if they could make it crispier the server asked me to remove the brat from the bun, remove all of the toppings and put the naked wiener on an empty tray that was sitting on the table... very sanitary way to handle food.  Once it returned (still not very crispy) I had to place it back in the cold bun, put the toppings back on and try to enjoy the rest of the meal as my friends played Jenga (home made with spare lumber that naturally sits off balance).  Beer selection 10/10 Food Quality 3/10 Atmosphere 9/10 Service 1/10"}
{"text":"Really wonderful service and atmosphere. For the most part I enjoy the good, especially the pretzel with beer cheese. But I would avoid the wings. Definitely tasted like they'd been cooked, frozen, then reheated."}
{"text":"Great beer (duh) and great food!  The menu was concise and paired well with the beers we selected.  My kid had this amazing Vanilla Jellybean Soda, and my beet salad and pretzel were awesome!  My hubby liked his burger and fries.  We were planning on brats for dinner so we had to pass on them for lunch.  It will be on the list the next time we visit.  Disappointing were the mustards, really.  For a German themed restaurant, bland mustards are NOT the way to go.    The bonus was that we got to meet one of the owners.  To be fair, it was the first week it opened so they were very active in the operations.  I don't think that will last much longer if it is still going on.  Our server was a little odd... made for a couple uncomfortable interactions.  He wasn't horrible, just odd.  I think we got an incorrect beer too - hubby is a professional brewer and I have worked in craft beer and wine for almost 10 years, we kinda know our beers.  BUT we are totally going back and we are totally sitting in the beer garden.  Parking stinks though.  Just know you will be parking a little ways away."}
{"text":"The food was great.. I haven't had garlic fries and a brat since I was last in Germany! This place would have gotten 5 stars had I not been charged $2.50 for an extra cheese sauce for my pretzel. Would have been nice to know ahead of time..."}
{"text":"Great beer list.  I mean that.  If it weren't for the beer list I'd probably give it a 3 star as the food was just ok.  Though, to be fair - I ordered chorizo off of friends' suggestions when I really wanted the spicy brat - so I need to go back and give it another shot on my own to give it a truly fair rating.  The pretzels to start were great - I'd certainly recommend those to anyone looking to give this place a try (and try they should)   Other notables: Love the patio when the weather cooperates and the wait staff was very attentive.    I will come here again and see if the food can match up to the beer - and if the Spicy Brat delivers I can see bumping this up to a 5."}
{"text":"Best beer in town. But i should only go there for octoberfest.  Food were not fresh last time i went..    Love this place. Cannot wait for octoberfest! ! Food are amazing and beer making me feel like I am in heaven. I gain several pounds around octoberfest."}
{"text":"First time visitors, and it did not disappoint! The only exception was the schnitzel, both parties at our table thought it was a little dry, even with the sauce. The cheese plate is an amazing  variety of meats, cheeses, and veges, and beautifully displayed. Waitress was great, and had good suggestions. Music was a little loud for normal conversation, but it really added to the fun atmosphere. It was a beautiful night, and we will be back again in the future. Nice place to bring out of towners too, since it's away from the noisier bars down the street. Great beer selection too."}
{"text":"Cool place, decent food. I like the funky soda selection."}
{"text":"Alex is a 5 star waitress hands down. She met the need of our 13 person group with ease. Brathous accomodates to all customers and understands the importance of quality customer service. I wouldn't go anywhere else for a brat in Phoenix. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Brat Haus has become a place my friends and I have to go to when we go to Spring Training each year.  This last year we stopped in three times in five days and each time we were met with great service, great food and amazing beer.  The outdoor beer garden is fantastic with tons of room and fun games like giant jenga to play.    I ate the schnitzel and spatzel and it was awesome! My friends are german and absolutely loved the various bratwursts available. Order the pretzels...they are amazing!!  A must stop when in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I sadly missed the Elite event here, but a friend of mine didn't and she took me to the Brat Haus the first chance she got. There was a lot of arm twisting (OK not really).  Lets start with Beer Selection: Yes. One of the best selections Ive seen and they have Hard Apple Cider. Reasonably priced beer and served frosty and amazing.  The burgers were good, but son, you came to Brat Haus for a reason...ORDER THE BRATWURST. You will absolutely not regret it. Some of the best sausage I have ever had. (Yes I see you giggling over there, QUIT BEING DIRTY).  But by far...the best for last...the pretzels and cheese. Oh. My. God.  I would like to order a dozen pretzels and a gallon of cheese sauce to be delivered to my house once a day thank you very much! I can't even begin to explain how amazing this is, I will go out of my way to come here just to have this. I like pretzels and cheese don't get me wrong but if you think this is some wetzels pretzels mall tasting concoction...you are mistaken...it makes them taste like cardboard.   Bring your friends, have a great time, drink some beer and nosh on the killer pretzels and cheese dip. You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Outstanding beer and pretzels and a great patio but can't recommend the brats sadly. Fries were good but too salty. Friendly service and great location but  for me this is a drinking only spot."}
{"text":"My kids wanted to take me out for a Father's Day lunch on Saturday cause they know I love brats. I've been really wanting to come here. We came here on one of the hottest summer days and yet summer is just starting. Ouch.   Anyways, for lunch it was a little confusing cause their outdoor beer garden and hostess stand was empty. In between their garden or outdoor seating is two small Haus for indoor seating. We just picked one cause it was so hot outside.   We were greeted right away but it took a little while to get our menus and drink orders but that's okay. We weren't in a rush or anything.    So based on the Yelp reviews, I knew what we want to start off with. We started out with the pretzel and cheese. It was so good. Loved the pretzel and dipped in the warm beer cheese. So so dang good. Then we ordered the Brat Haus Poutine. Fries were nice and crispy with gravy and pieces of fried pork belly. That was so good and so big. It was way too much for the four of us but really good.   I ordered the BBQ Boar which had boar and bacon with shredded BBQ pork on top. When I got it, I was so overwhelmed. Didn't know how to attach it. Pick it up. Nope. Had to fork and knife it. It was okay. I think the BBQ overwhelmed the brat and took all the flavor away from the brat. The BBQ pork was okay and even through the shredded pork was soaked in BBQ sauce the porky was a little dry (if that makes sense at all). It was so much I was barely able to finish it.   My wife had the Umami which was basically ginger pork & chicken sausage on a bun. She got all the basic toppings on the side. It was too spicy for her so she switched with my daughter with the Haus brats. She liked that a lot better. My son got the BH chili dog and he thought it was okay.   So overall, the appetizers were great. Pretzel and Poutine were really good and I would recommend for sure. The brats were okay. Not great but good. The service was a little slow but everything slows downs on a really hot day (115 degrees) in Scottsdale. I liked it and would really like to try some of their other brats cause I'm a brats lover."}
{"text":"Went here for their Octoberfest celebration on a nice cool night and sat on the patio.  Once again was extremely disapointed in the service and the food.  Ordered the schnitzel and it came out say we say extremely well done.  My wife ordered a pretzel as an appetizer and it never arrived.  She was disapointed in the size of her sausage which was mostly bread and had to order another item to fill her up.  Use caution if ordering a bottled beer, crazy high prices on anything Belgian. Cheaper and better options abound around town."}
{"text":"Ambiance Taste Price  When you go to restaurants you usually get to pick two out of the three. With Brat Haus it was pretty good on all fronts but I felt something was lacking.  The Ski soda, mustards, and the fries were fantastic as were the truffle aioli accompannying the fries.   However, the Charcuterie pate and the beer brat in my opinion didn't hold up as well.  The pate was more meat loaf slices with interesting things nestled in. Maybe I deserved it for ordering pate at a german themed restaurant but I was expecting a smooth creamy terrine of liver pate.  The beer brat encased in roll with pickled onions didn't really shine either. In fact if it weren't for the distractions of the fries and mustards I might have noticed how underwhelming the taste of the brat was.  The house made dijon mustard however was stellar as it was as good as Maille in France.  I'm a little confused on the theme of this restaurant, is this a europub or german stein house. I would've liked a brat, potato pancake, and a spaetzle instead of a dressed up hot dog with one topping for $6.50.  The aesthetics and design of the place is pretty cool however, feels like your tucked away in a ski village in Europe."}
{"text":"Great German experience. The schnitzel was delicious. Just ask for extra gravy. Every kind of beer is here and  everything is made on site.  The outside patio area is great for kids. Ping pong table and a huge chalk board keeps the children happy. Fun place."}
{"text":"I grew up feeling sorry for Yosemite Sam and Elmer Fudd. All that effort to catch and eat a rabbit, all for nothing. When I got the chance to eat a rabbit bratwurst, I took it. And it was for Sam and Elmer. They probably didn't imagine their rabbit coming with sweet-onion relish, curry catsup or anything called an \"ailoli.\" Their loss.  My wife's lamb brat was just as good as my bunny (I hadn't eaten rabbit since I was something like 5 years old). And we had nary a quibble with the date cake for dessert. It was kind of like an Australian sticky-date pudding, and ranks as one of my favorite non-chocolate-based desserts. I have nothing bad to say about the beer selection, either.   Service? Enthusiastic, opinionated, fast. I love getting a server's honest opinion on their favorites and their suggestions (particularly good for deciding which topping to pair with your rattlesnake/duck/vegetarian bratwurst)."}
{"text":"There isn't many options with no bacon haha but we ordered a vegan burger they had on the menu and it was really really good! Defiantly worth it and I would go back to have it again and we ordered garlic fries they were excellent as well, and 2 pretzels with a side of Nutella and super good sauces!! You can also rent a bike from the little cute van that's parked outside and they have a fun outdoor backyard seating area, ping pong table and jenga :)"}
{"text":"I walked in here to order some food to go.  The host lead me to the bar building and told me to order there. It was loud and full of drunk people. I am sober and didn't feel too comfortable  in a bar but wanted to try to food since the reviews here are good. Some guy even offered me a shot. That was nice of him but I declined.  So I placed my food after struggling to get the bartenders attention. When my food was ready she was so busy that it took a while for her to get it, meanwhile I stand at the bar like an idiot.  So I finally took my food across the street to the hospital where my friend was staying at. I was not impressed.  Garlic pork sausage was dry and crumbled apart.  German potato salad was soggy and gross. Couldn't eat more than 2 bites.  Would I eat here again? No.   Would I recommend you eat here? If you want to get hammered and don't care about how the food taste then, yes."}
{"text":"I'm surprised with the high reviews for this place. Although our server was nice and my sweet brat was decent, it took far too long to get our food. My boyfriend also got food poisoned from their spicy brat. My iced tea tasted like water, and the water I got tasted like dishwater detergent. One star for the Belgian fries, which were excellent. Won't be returning and I don't recommend this establishment. There are far better places to eat at."}
{"text":"Sorry Brat Haus, but I am not a fan.  1) Seating is primarily outdoors- great, except we live in Phoenix. Not sustainable.  2) Nothing special about the food here. Maybe I am just spoiled and used to a much more exotic selection of dogs, but even removing my prejudice.. These aren't that great.  3) Beer selection is decent. Nothing to write home.   Overall, I just think Brat Haus is missing that certain something.. Hopefully with time, they will improve."}
{"text":"THE GERMANS ARE HERE THE GERMANS ARE HERE!!!(please read aloud in a German accent).  The Germans have arrived to Old Town Scottsdale and have brought their wieners with them. The Brathaus recently opened in the ever so familiar yet always at least hour wait location Oregano's used to be in.   First thing first I have to give kudos to whoever had the idea o get ride of those 4 parking spots Oregano's had and turned it into an open beer garden. Genius!   The Brathaus set up very similar to how Oregano's used to be expect now the building on the right is filled with 20+ craft international beers on tap. And if you want the true experience upgrade that craft beer to a DAS BOOT!  Now on to the food. A relatively simple menu and its exactly what you think brats, burgers and boxed water? Ya they have boxed water apparently its the best water in the world....for $10 a case it better be the drinking fountain of youth.   The bottom line is you get  a choice of brat from spicy, beer, sweet...the list goes on. Then you get a choice of traditional toppings 3 are included each one after that is .75cents a piece. For your side I would recommend sharing a large fries and make sure to ask for the dipping sauces they are awesome!   My brat was good I got a beer brat with sauerkraut relish and spicy pickles. It was cooked well, toppings were good and plentiful. If I had to critique I would say the bun was a little dry but that's if I had to say something.   Now we went on day 5 of them being open so talking about the service isn't totally fair so I'll be nice. The service was pretty lets say overwhelmed. We waited in front of the bar for close to 30 minutes before the bartender even noticed us. Then the food took a while but everything did come out right the first time. However I will say  our server was working his tail off to make sure everything was right so his effort offset the delays.   I will be going back to the BratHaus and hope this one of a kind spot in Scottsdale stays around for a while. I mean you can't beat a good beer and a brat."}
{"text":"After a Tour de Tavern ride the service here was horrible. The staff was super rude and unfriendly."}
{"text":"The sausage selection here is great and they always have some unique specials (Rattlesnake Brat). The fries are absolutely incredible, I'd honestly come back just for those.   The service is attentive but not over bearing. Happy to make recommendations and what beers pair well with what, they also have a great selection of local Arizona beers which is awesome. It's a great causal date night kind of thing or some place to meet a bunch of people at because it is open seating with plenty of space. 10 out of 10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my bf's family and I really enjoyed the food! First, we had the pretzel appetizer that the waiter recommended and it was fairly addicting. It was so fresh we had to wait a while for it to cool down. It came with cheese fondue and special spicy mustard. I ended up getting the pig mac burger and the bf got the spicy brat with pickled peppers. We split both and boy it was good. The burger consists of 1/4 lb sausage & 1/4 lb beef. It was cooked so well and it was super filling. They have a hush hush sauce which is comparable to a thousand island based sauce. The spicy brat was probably one of the best I've had considering I am not a huge brat fan. Both items had quality bread. We got a large order of the fries to share amongst the table and they were awesome. I recommend the chipotle aioli dipping sauce, the bleu cheese- bacon sauce was alright but I wish we had tried the sriracha aioli sauce instead. They have a good selection of beers and the staff is very helpful. I would definitely recommend giving this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times the food has been very good. Love the giant jenga set and cornhole. Great beer selection. Didn't try dessert but should have. Next time we're in town, it will likely make the short list!"}
{"text":"Grand Opening today for the much-anticipated new restaurant helmed by partners Dave Andrea and Chef Payton Curry in Old Town Scottsdale.    There are two houses with a large patio in the middle of this beautiful property. The deli building which houses fast service and food to go is to the left and the bar where food is ordered and the taps, is located in the building to the right. The seating in both are cozy and comfortable. The bar side displays an extensive array of beer and a chalk board to advertise the live beer alerts.   We sat on the patio at a refectory table, an elongated table used originally for dining in monasteries in Medieval times or the Late Middle Ages. Think casual Harry Potter dining. The water misting system kept us very comfortable. Chill guys and gals come to your table to serve.   The menu is showing gourmet options and exotic meats including duck sausage with dates, Moroccan lamb sausage, and turkey loukaniko, rattlesnake and rabbit. Traditional German food at a Christmas reunion table, with the exception of the snake. I also see local favorite food like grilled artisan sausages, burgers, Belgian fries, hand-twisted pretzels.    Today I ordered up a Chemay Cing Cents. $12. This is a 99 point triple white with an ABV of 8%. Poured into a Chimay Belgium 10 oz., goblet. Shows its typical golden colour, a slightly hazy appearance and its fine head. I love Trappist beer. For my second beer I order a Monk's Caf√© Flemish Sour Ale. $8. Lightly chilled 11.2 oz. bottle poured into a tulip. This is an 86 point dark reddish brown ale. Drinks like a cider. Crisp and easy, definitely on the sweet side. A good sipper. My GF ordered the Spaten Oktoberfest $6.   We shared a sweet brat with an apricot onion chutney topping. $5.75 and a hard pretzel. The Honey Mustard and the Dijon are Haus made. The sausage was excellent and the in house mustard was superb.   I placed an order to go for the kids. The Pig Mac. $7.50 A 1/4 lb pork sausage & a 1/4 lb ground beef with lettuce, pickle, caramelized onion and hush hush sauce. This sandwich is a monster and will need to be cut into quarters to eat. On looks alone it's a winner.   Also I brought home desert for later. Drunken Date Cake $5 An intoxicating sponge cake made with Oatmeal Stout. I might have this at midnight, will let you know.   www.brathausaz.com www.facebook.com/BratHausAZ"}
{"text":"Walking in at 6:10 (drat, just missed happy hour which ends at 6:00) I was greeted in a friendly manner by a young man at the front.  After asking where I'd like to sit, he pointed me to the bar when I replied inside.   It was a cloudy and slightly cold day so I figured inside was better than outside.  Once inside one of the bartenders greeted me and handed me a menu. I started off with brat sliders and ski, a lemon orange soda that reminded me of mountain dew, but less strong and drinkable.  The bar had a decent number of people in it originally, but not to full and slowly got busier as I sat there.   The brats were good, basically you get a 1/2 brat, and the beer selection was quite extensive.  I'm sensitive to hot food and the spicy brat was perfectly edible so I'd warn you it's not \"hot\" more spiced or flavorful.  I would call this an American Gastropub take on a German beer garden since it isn't the same (I've been to Munich).  However, it will make you happy if you want some Germanish food and beer.    I could tell the guys working the bar cared about the beer.  I overheard a few conversations where one talked about switching a tap/line because they had a cherry beer in there and it lingered a bit and they didn't want to have that ruin someones drink.  I also saw the bartender give the guys who were picking up beer orders some tests (friendly) where he'd give them a smell or taste and they would try to guess which beer was which.  Too bad I don't live nearby or I'd come back here."}
{"text":"Good brats. Beers good but pricy.  Corn hole outside but 21 foot.  Junior league. Will be back."}
{"text":"This place is just not that good, I don't know, just saying. The staff was pretty rude and sarcastic, they constantly were asking for our order when I was clearly visually upset and not ready, was having a bad day is all, still I felt rushed. The brat was average, fries were pretty good, but I wouldn't care to have them again. I liked that they had RC and various sodas. Also there's no parking and rude people block the path out and street by taking pictures, so plan accordingly. ; )"}
{"text":"There is no other way to sum it up but this place is AWESOME. Great food and beer selection is just the half of it. The other half, is it feels like you're dining in someone's backyard with the picnic tables, being outside, a giant Jenga set, etc. Was a great place to have dinner after a Giants Spring Traininig game with a large group of friends. I'll definitely be back whenever we are in the area again. Great experience"}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far.  Both times just for drinks and appetizers.  The Belgian fries were good and crispy with a vast selection of tasty dipping sauces, and the same goes for the pretzels.  They also have a great selection of beers from Germany on tap, but the first time we went they were out of probably a fourth of them. Watch out if they are out!  Nonetheless, it is a great stop for an afternoon or late night bite!"}
{"text":"We recently through a baby shower at the Brat Haus AND it was amazing! Our server Nick was a dream server to have. He didn't just do his job he went blew our expectations away!!! The food was fantastic, environment fun, and guest loved that it was traditional baby shower party. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The beer was great! I had the spaten which as for me I'm not a beer drinker, but man was this stuff good!! The schnitzels are also amazing!! The poutine was also just as good!! If you're in the the area I strongly recommend you find your inner German at this amazing place!!!"}
{"text":"Great and authentic beer selection! After being stationed in Germany I grew a fondness for weissbeirs :) they have a  very nice casual atmosphere and the music is great. It's a nice place to stop while wandering around Scottsdale. I will certainly be back! :)"}
{"text":"Very relaxed atmosphere. Casual and friendly service. Brat was way over cooked and the bun was dried out."}
{"text":"Duck and date with apricot onion chutney= awesome trip for my taste buds. Thanks Payton"}
{"text":"Pretzel with Nutella. Enough Said.  The rest of the food is ok, but what really gets you for this place its the outside patio. Do not come here on a hot day, there isn't enough misters or fans it is truly an outdoor patio. But, during the non-summer months, it is a fun place to meet a group of friends. And they have a good beer selection.  Great Location, Service is good, Could improve on food but please try that pretzel!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing Mr and my girlfriend come here all the time and the service is some of the best that I have seen. Everyone seems to be happy here ad well."}
{"text":"This place used to be one of our faves :( Those days are gone... now the menu is missing some items, including the amazing Beet & Goat Cheese Salad. Some of the Brats are no longer on the menu either. Asked for the Burger 'rare' and they won't cook any meat under 'medium'. 'Kraft singles' cheese on the burger!!! Ugh. Ordered an 'Old Fashioned' Cocktail and it was not made correctly. The quality of food has gone down hill. A very disappointing dining experience. We will never go back."}
{"text":"This review is only on one plate of food I had here. Wild boar sausage sounds good on menu but is flavorless and dry. On top of it, it costs $10. Not worth it. However love the ambiance and would come here for beers and go watch the game and our server was sweet and helpful!"}
{"text":"Really cute spot on the edge of old town that we have wanted to try for a while. The patio looks like it would be great for cooler weather. We came here for my boyfriends birthday with a group of about 9. The waitress was kind enough to put the cakes in the fridge for us but that is where her pleasantries ended. She seemed very annoyed that we were taking so long to decide and was irritated when we asked for a refil, some ranch and actually said? \"you really need more....?\" when my boyfriend asked for more lemons for his schnitzel.  I'm assuming her service was so shitty because she had the automatic gratuity added to the bill due to our large party because there were only two other tables filled in the whole joint.   The food is no where near authentic and I thought the fries were too greasy and all the sauces just tasted weird. The schnitzel was flavorless and the gravy was horrible!! My schnitzel sub was very bland and greasy but the bread was decent.  Someone got a brat that was actually really good and had awesome sauerkraut.    To sum it up, stick to beer or a brat if you come here. Not at all a German resteraunt."}
{"text":"Shnitzel sliders, pretzels with amazing beer cheese sauce, and the best bratwursts in town.  On top of all of that, the happy hour is fantastic and takes a couple of bucks off most draft beers, of which they have a great selection of both german and north american varieties, with a rotational lineup as well based on season.    Plus, big jenga blocks and ping pong for people who want to play some games!  Really fun outdoor area with a huge outdoor fireplace.. a great homey place.  Overall, A+."}
{"text":"I love what they have done with the place post Oregano's. The patio is fantastic and the bar area is dark and intimate and perfect for conversation. I tried the beer brat with sauerkraut - simple and amazing! I didn't get to try one of the dozens of German and Belgian beers on tap this time."}
{"text":"Okay, I made a huge mistake and came here with a semi full stomach. Not much room for beer or a brat. So with that said, I can only comment on the pretzel pretty much. Holy Shit these are good! Where the hell were these when I was popping those hard nasty ass pretzels in the microwave. Baked to perfection these soft pretzels are soft and chewy yet have a nice baked crust. Salted evenly with the beer cheese for dippin, is a huge hell yeah! I will definitely be coming back to try the brats and beer. Nat√ºrlich! (I sure hope that translates to Hell Yeah!)"}
{"text":"I love a good brat but these are out if this world!  I highly recommend everyone check out Brat Haus.  I will warn you that they are busy most of the time but it's worth the wait.  They have the best beer selection I have seen.  You will receive the best service from the staff!  I was recently in for a visit with some friends and had the best time.  I was treating my friends with a gift certificate I recently won at the Ugly Christmas Party.  Thanks Brat Haus!!!  The Fundido is a must starter!  You can never go wrong with Pretzels and 3-cheese-beer dipping sauce.  The last time I tried the Moroccan Lamb sausage.  Very delicious with the Apricot Onion Chutney.  Belgium Fries are a must and don't forget the Truffle Aioli!  I am not one for having dessert but everyone must try the Drunken Date Cake.  This delicious cake is made with Oatmeal Stout and will have you asking for more.    A trip to Brat Haus is the perfect way to start a night in Old Town.  I love that they constantly change their mural.  Thanks Dave and the wonderful staff of Brat Haus!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, good people to chat with. It was so good, I went back for my last night in town. I had the Boar and Bacon, and the Lamb and Goat Currywurst.  Both were on par. They seemed to be out of several of the beers, but they were helpful with finding other beers you might like. Glad I finally undo this place."}
{"text":"The service was great and the brats were great as well!!  We had the homemade pretzel, cheese curds, and hummus for appetizers that were to die for!!  We also had the pleasure of getting a free sample of their rattlesnake chili!  The sample of rattlesnake chili was very flavorful!!  It was wonderful having another dinner with our friends, Mike and Kimberly!!  Always lots of laughs!!"}
{"text":"Pretty neat place.  Parking was kind of a pain, but I wasn't the one driving (whew.)   Service was alright but a bit slow and somewhat impersonal.   Sat outside and it was a miracle I did not get any mosquito bites. I liked the spray of cool mist they have for the outdoor tables, ahhh, very refreshing!  Great beer selection but felt like the food options were a bit lacking. Pretzel was really good. I don't even remember what type of brat I tried...it was not super memorable. But I tasted a little bit of everyone else's and - when you try all they have to offer - it's not bad but really didn't floor me either. I think if my stomach could tolerate spicy food, I would have liked this place much better. Ah well. I don't know if I would come back here unless I was with a group like before."}
{"text":"Items sampled include:  Haus Original Pretzel with $3 Warm Three Cheese Beer Dipping Sauce  Haus Bacon Wrapped Dates  Imported Pecorino and Honeycomb  Belgian Fries with Ranch  Fall Turkey Brat with Butternut Squash, Apples, Sage   Duck and Dates with Coriander, Fennel Seed, Orange Zest  Beer Brat with Parsley, Oregano, Beer  (Root Beer Onions, Apricot Onion Chutney, Picked Red Onions)  Brat Burger - Pork Sausage Patty, Fried Egg, Swiss Cheese  Drunken Date Cake - Oatmeal Stout and Whipped Cream  Belgian Waffle with Jalapeno Honey Butter and Syrup  Spending the afternoon of New Year's Eve in and around Scottsdale as lunch came around I asked my family what they were craving and deciding against Lo Lo's after much debate we ended up at Brat Haus in hopes of finding the artisanal sausage house as good as previous visits to similar locales in Chicago...but unfortunately no such luck would be found.  Clearly a spot where the impressive beer list supersedes the quality of the food our meal started off on the wrong foot when we were denied seating in the main dining room and placed in a smaller back bar area and although the bartender was pleasant enough while a great soundtrack played overhead it became quite obvious early on that our lack of enthusiasm for suds was unappreciated with food arriving slowly, often far from hot while water refills required direct inquiry.  Focusing on the food, a first round of appetizers proved to be fine, if not wowing - the pretzel nothing to write home about and the \"do you want cheese with that\" commanding an unannounced $3 up charge while the dates and pecorino were a nice sweet and savory pairing with quality ingredients well prepared.  Last and perhaps least, a basket of fries was ordered by my aunt and although I'm far from an expert I found them to be a bit undercooked; more starchy and less fluffy than I'd prefer.     Moving on to the meat of the menu (pun intended) aside from being luke warm and served on a decent roll I do not understand the reviews for the brats at Brat Haus and, as a matter of fact, with all the ridiculously hefty spices I'd defy anyone to differentiate on blind tasting the difference between pig, duck, or turkey on any of our selections - a lack of subtlety that led to my mother giving up after a few bites and even challenged myself on the duck brat as I felt like I was eating the smell of Penzey's Spices more than anything protein.  Faring better - as a matter of fact quite a bit better - my aunt's burger with a supple and smoky patty, fried egg, and sharp Swiss was the highlight of the savories; a case of \"Keep it Simple, Stupid\" if there ever was one.  For desserts - generally not a beer fan I actually liked what the rich chocolate stout did to temper the sweetness of the dates and the waffle that so many have raved was indeed a light at the end of the tunnel; a light, airy, and golden crisp disc with a bit of spice balanced by the sweet honey showing that the kitchen can indeed achieve balanced boldness when they try - or perhaps when they DON'T try and end up overthinking and overshooting their mark as they did with the sausages."}
{"text":"Why not stop for the best brat in town and enjoy the yard , games and atmosphere .. Choice of drinks is endless and if you love garlic fries so far the best in Az I have had . Aoli sauces are superb. It is a quaint place with that neighborhood get together atmosphere. They also host bbq parties .. Not cheap though but prob worth it. Would love to have my 50th here"}
{"text":"I see myself visiting here again soon. Hopefully sooner than later. I shared a footlong brat with sauerkraut, grain mustard, relish, on a noble roll--so delish!! Many craft beers--no bud, Coors, or Miller, but the waiter suggest a Ballast Point Long fin lager which was wonderful. The Belgian fries were to die for. We had truffle aioli and ranch as sauces. Such a cool place!  Outdoor beer garden, an indoor bar, and a small dining area for eating inside if you don't want to go into the bar. This is a contemporary place with an uptown feel, and very good service."}
{"text":"Just left Brat Haus. Amazing dinner. Had the house brat with the house made Saurkraut. Also ordered doggie brats for our canine babies. My husband had the weiner schnitzel. Also great. And Susan, our server, was awesome. I highly recommend this wonderful, dog friendly place in Old Town"}
{"text":"This is a gem of a place nestled in Old Town Scottsdale. The server was very knowledgable about both their beer menu and food and provided awesome recommendations.  The ambiance makes this place either a cozy intimate affair or a fun group gathering. The main seating area is an outdoor pbackyard patio.  If you don't have your own entertainment you can choose from some awesome games of ping pong, teatherball , or try your had at life sized Jenga, it was amazing.   The food and beer were equal to the service received.  I enjoyed the spicy brat with some spicy peppers and probably to most delicious sauerkraut I've ever tasted.  All complimented with a flavorful and smooth German Amber beer.  If you haven't checked out this place before I recommend experiencing it for yourself.  This place would be great to host company parties."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once with my dad and for with a company function.  Both times I felt the same way. The actual place is great. They have a nice patio with ping pong and tetherball!  They also have a great beer selection. Lots of taps and bottles, and they usually have something unique or hard to find. Last time I was there they had one of my favorites, Firestone Double Jack.  Also their apps are great! The wings are really good and they might have the best pretzels with cheese I've ever had at a bar.  The reason they don't get more stars is I have not really enjoyed much of their actual entrees. I've tried some burgers and brats and nothing was that special that would make me want to eat a meal there.  Overall a great place to meet with friends, grab beers and pretzels and then play some games! Just not a place I would want to eat a full meal at again."}
{"text":"It's pretty delicious and I like the location. I came in here one day while I was waiting for AAA to help with my car so I was a bit stressed and in a hurry so I only ordered a pretzel and I could tell the waitress was a bit annoyed but I plan on coming back for a full meal."}
{"text":"I had a horrible first time experience yesterday when I cam to Brat Haus. I sat down at the bar with my date and shortly after an extremely drunk man was kicked out of the bar. After waiting for 15 minutes we finally got to bartenders attention and ordered drinks. The staff was clearly overwhelmed but it seemed as though it would've been their first day open. The environment was so stressful and the gentleman who seemed to be the manager even was snappy with customers. My date ordered our food and the bartender (who was clearly in a bad mood) wouldn't even allow him to add sauerkraut to his bratwurst order. It was so bizarre how poorly run this place was. I felt uncomfortable, unwanted, and stressed the entire time there. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"The burger, pretzels, and brats are soo delicious! I love this place, the atmosphere is so fun and laid back. The have a bunch of games to play too."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that this was the first time we've ever been to this place and will not be going back. The service was just terrible, our server looked like some typical Scottsdale hag that had better things to do, she was slow and not attentive at all. We ordered wings and then 15 minutes later she brings out moist towelettes. Thanks, but it's a bit late for that. I ordered their lemonade,mind you it's hot  so I chugged it and  she actually asks if I want a refill, Ya think? After that ordeal the food comes out I got the schnitzel sub, well they really should rename it to the schnitzel SUBpar because it was bland and not even their curry ketchup sauce could save it. It wasn't the worst but most definitely forgettable. Unless you're drinking I would just skip this place. Should've gone with my instinct and stuck to oreganos, at least their food has flavor!"}
{"text":"I drove from central phoenix to old town Scottsdale on a Saturday night to satisfy a craving for German food.  Their website said they close at 11pm and I arrived at maybe 1015.  I was unapologetically that the kitchen had closed because business was slow.  Not my problem. Either do what you say you're going to do, stay open, or change your website to reflect you actual practices.  Update number 1 Less than 8 hours after I left my first review, I received a very nice message from the owner of the business. He agreed with what I said and changed the website and yelp to reflect their actual practices. He also offered to send me a gift card, going above and beyond. I will post another update after I've eaten there. But right now I'm upping their rating from one star to two."}
{"text":"Beer, lots of it, and meat in tube form, under one roof???? Where do I begin.  The waiter have us some suggestions for beer and we tried the Bell Double IPA. Probably the best beer I've ever had. His suggestions for food were also great. We tried the sliders. All of them were very good. The one that stood out the most was the spicy brat with root beer onion on top. OMG. Just sooooo good. I also ordered the potato salad which was made better by the fried egg on top. Why is everything better with a fried egg on top? I can't wait to come back and try some more new things..."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 3 because the parking is difficult. We drove around the block a couple of times before we realized they dont actually have a parking lot designated for them.  I hate to say bad things but the food was not that good.  My wife and I had the salted pretzel which I thought was sort of small for 2 people and we ran out of cheese sauce very quickly.  Definitely need more cheese sauce.  For our main course we both had the pork snitzel.  I served in the military, and I was stationed in Germany  so I have had good pork snitzel.  This was very average and did not have much flavor.  It was a bit tough and not very juicy.  Kind of dry to be honest and the fries were very greasy.  The service was excellent though thats why I was generous with the 3 stars.  Will probably look for a different place when we want German food."}
{"text":"Bring your appetite!   We came here before the Reds/SF Giants spring training game and walked away with sauerkraut and brat (and beer) filled bellies.   Service was great, we appreciated the waitress' urgency in getting our app and beer ordered just minutes before HH ended. The one draw back was our burnt pretzel..I was absolutely starving so I was still able to eat it but it was just not the best. A bit of a disappointment since we were eating at a German spot but didn't make or break our experience. Brats are huge to the point you don't even need to order a side. The sauerkraut is to-die-for, much more fresh and crispy than your typical store-bought canned variety! Yummy curry ketchup available at each table.   Their beer garden is a wonderful spot for casual brews - bistro lights adorn the trees and there is ample seating that can accommodate parties both large and small.   This is my spot go-to PHX spot when I need to  fulfill my German cravings..Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Saw Jamie M (review below) the same night. She's spot on. It's a cute place, but our waiter was sarcastic to a point it was not funny. Keep in mind this is outdoor seating only... if they have outdoor, was not offered. Had a burger with an egg on it. Roll was a little old. Too much spice and not great taste. Pretzles were stail. 3 stars is a little too much but maybe they will get better with time."}
{"text":"Best place for German food around. Can't go wrong with the garlic fries and the DAS BRAT or any Sausage. Great for dates and quality food with an awesome outside huge patio. the outside is so big that you could seriously invite 50 of your friends and have a place to sit.   I'm a HUGE FAN of this place. Awesome customer service too. Oh and they do $20 movie nights on Sundays which include food and a drink while you watch a movie..AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"The over all ambiance was great! A good selection of beer on tap and the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is a bit pricy but it's a great place to hang out and grab a beer. I happened to come here when I had a huge bratwurst craving and this place hit the spot no problem. I love that they give you the option to pick your brat as well as the toppings that go on it. I got the standard haus sausage with the sweet onion jam and the sweet and spicy peppers. The jam was delicious but they really mean spicy with the peppers! I had to scrape off the remaining sweet and spicy peppers so beware if you can't handle heat; it's not a subtle kick. It'll get you! I do recommend coming here if you're in the area as it's something you can't really find anywhere else!"}
{"text":"We recently went to Brat Haus on a Saturday Night, it was decently busy for Old Town and the wait was around 20 minutes.  After we we sat there was about a 10 minute delay between sitting down and having our drink order taken and then another 10 minutes to get the beers which were not ice cold, more like chilled and on the way toward room temperature. After this the service picked up and the food was delivered to our table in an expected amount of time (10-15 minutes).  The brats were delicious  along with the wide selection of Mustard to go with the Garlic Fries which were demolished.  All in all the evening cost about $80 for three of us, so for some brats and beer it is on the high side but that is to be expected of Old Town Scottsdale, I will probably be back to give some of the other brats and pretzels a try."}
{"text":"The beers here were delicious, food was ok. However, the ridiculously smothered French fries (can't remember the name) was delicious!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for the best craft beer bar in Old Town (if not one of the best in the valley) Brat Haus is your spot. I thought it was so good that I went two nights in a row!  Attention Bells Two Hearted lovers...they have it...on tap! Not only that they have some of my favorites including a spread of Lagunitas, Stone and Dogfish Head.   On my first visit, we were not messing around and ordered the delicious Dogfish Head 120 minute IPA. Be warned that it's a $15 bottle, which only seems expensive unless you have had it served to you somewhere else (Taste of Tops charges ~$20 when they have it in stock).   We split the pretzels and fundido to start. The pretzels are delicious and are a great  filler/base when tackling the beer menu. The fundido was good and I'd like to try it with sausage/exotic meat. I had the guest Sicilian sausage with peppers which was back-East-style delicious! The next evening we stopped in for apps, and I repeated the pretzel and fundido order and stuck with the Two Hearted all the way.   I can't wait for it to cool down a little bit so we can enjoy the expansive outdoor area. I also predict that this will be one of \"the\" destinations after spring training games. Well done Payton and I look forward to visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Old Town Scottsdale, hands down. The service is always great and the food and beer is delicious. Matt, the bartender, really knows his beer and is super friendly, and Kevin, one of the managers is always really welcoming. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place was really worth the walk in the heat to get there from our hotel. We sat inside and ordered some delicious beers. I don't remember which i chose but it was a lager. I was parched and it was so yummy. We ordered the braised pig tail poutin and it was just incredibly good. Dear god, i want more now! The meat was off the bone and very tender in the gravy and the cheese curds just melted in your mouth. The potatoes were fried to perfection and the portion was more than enough for two. We also ordered the lamb sausage and the duck sausage. While I loved both, the lamb was the better of the two and the apricot chutney on it really complimented it well. If you love sausages and craft beer, this place is a must!!!"}
{"text":"Sooooooo... this place is OBVIOUSLY German. So if you don't eat pork (like me) this may not be for you. The waitress was really great to help up with the food and drink menus. They have an all beef franks and chicken wings as alternatives. Don't forget to get the Belgian fries! The truffle a√Øoli sauce was literally having us melting. When you just keep says \" mmm so good, yeah. So good\" Nice selection of brews for sure."}
{"text":"I'm in town from San Diego for the weekend, walked in on a Friday night at 9:45PM & it wasn't very busy. The reason why my girlfriends & I chose this spot was because it was around the corner from where we were staying. Now back to the not too busy....so much so the hostess was busy playing Jenga w/ a table of customers but she quickly noticed us and took us to our table. However what was uncomfortable was how she asked these 2 ladies who were already sitting at the table to get up & move because they had clearly not read the \"please wait to be seated\" sign at the hostess stand & so they just sat themselves at a table. Well my dear hostess maybe if you had been at your podium instead of playing Jenga the ladies would've never have sat themselves in the first place! Once we were seated we were handed menus and that was all. No \"can I get you a glass of water\" and maybe it's because there's a drought idk but it just wasn't the usual seating I'm used to. The hostess gave us our menus & went back to playing Jenga. 7 minutes passed by and no server. At this time I went to the Jenga table & asked if we had to walk to the bar to order food and drinks or what...hostess said she would go get the server. 5 minutes later the server walks up & tells us that they are so slammed and busy and apologizes for the wait. We order food and drinks. I order 3 different sliders which all turned out to be mediocre. The patty was practically burnt on my sliders, I didn't find anything special about them. My girlfriend had cheese curds which were ok. I only gave this place 2 stars because the beer was good."}
{"text":"what a good concept, this place has a comfortable feel with great beers on tap.giant Jinga with 32 Oz German mugs please 's me.the only issue I had is that the staff could be a little more professional. I don't expect to be waited on hand and foot like a prince but I do expect the staff to act as if they are representing this great restaurant in a professional manner.i will be back but not expecting much on the service."}
{"text":"Impressive beer list (Delirium Tremens on tap!), delicious brats (I had the Spicy, friend had the Thai Chicken), and amazing fries with oh-so-not-healthy-but-oh-so-yummy dipping sauces. Our waiter Chris was friendly, funny and took great care of us!  Looking forward to going back.   PS. Beer prices are definitely Scottsdale prices though, so that's why I gave 4 stars."}
{"text":"Went again last weekend with my husband. Had the same FABULOUS server- thanks Michael! And they had changed the bun on the burger. Much easier to hold. Still have \"short\" fries. Guess it's the  Belgian thing...don't know. Anyway, got to sit outside and it was really nice. Give them a try- I don't want them to go away...."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  It's a great, relaxed, hang out spot.  Big picnic tables that are great for groups, or for sitting with strangers and making new friends.  Games like washer toss, tetherball, & giant Jenga encourage you to get up and be social, and make you feel better about drinking 4 beers.  The food is delicious, the service is great, and prices are reasonable.   Most of the seating is outdoors, with only a few tables inside, so I'll be curious to see what they do in the summer when it's 110 outside."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago during Octoberfest. I am German so it was a nice place to get German beer. I loved the back patio, that included life-sized Jenga games, bags, and a ping pong table. The waitress was super nice, food was good, and I loved the selection of beers. Will be back! :)"}
{"text":"Today is May 12th and there must be some sort of organized event because when we first arrived in a group of seven with open tables clearly available we were told by a \"security guard\" that the garden was rented out, after proceeding to the main bar we were helped by a bartender who said she'd love to help us and allowed us to hang around in the back yard area, about five to ten minutes afterwards she approached us again with an older gentlemen claiming to be part owner and he expressed that though there are open tables and although we had been seated that there were tables informs of us and advised us we can drink but not eat.... I am absolutely baffled that an owner would take money straight out of his own pocket after their mistake of sitting us... I will never return as I've never actually been so disrespected in my whole life     In reply to Dave; You were clearly embarrassed you couldn't resolve the situation your staff put itself in, rightfully so, however you're trying to make it seem that waiting was our problem which is hilarious considering we were already seated. You and your establishment are a joke. You as the \"part owner\" clearly had an agenda and righting your wrongs was not priority, we didn't \"bypass\" anything we tried to bring business to your place by going to the bar where Adrianna sat us.  I'll review you in this fashion on every platform I can find. If you noticed I review lots of places, GOOD AND BAD  I average a 5 star review rate so you receiving ONE Star is nothing short of accurate"}
{"text":"Fun staff, tasty food, huge beer selection, live music, and a beer garden with games and space for events like yoga(Sunday mornings)."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome. Great place great food great staff great atmosphere great environment great entertainment"}
{"text":"This place has the best bratwurst I've ever eaten! My husband and I tried the currywurst and the venison brat and they were both excellent. The flavors are simply amazing! Also I think they make their own saukraut, we loved it. And you must try the german potatoes! The poutine was just ok but I'm picky being that I'm from Montreal. Would come back here next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Love love love this German Beer House meets Texas Grill joint! From the outside it looks small but they also have an outdoor patio that caters to groups and parties. They also have ping pong, corn hole, and giant Jenga, which is a nice touch.  My boyfriend and I went there for happy hour which had certain apps for $2 off and pints for $2 off. I appreciate that they had some beers on Nitros which gives you the smooth taste of the beer without the carbonated effect. I got the Four Peaks Brewing Co. Oatmeal Stout, which was my bf's favorite of the 4-beer flight he got too.   For food, we got pretzels with cheese dip ($4 during HH), Sriracha butter wings ($5), and shared an order of small Belgian fries with truffle aioli and Moroccan lamb brat with apricot chutney. Everything was delicious, loved that nothing was oily or too salty. The aioli that came with the fries had just the right amount of truffle flavor. The brat was probably the best brat we've ever had and paired nicely with the apricot chutney.  They were definitely busy as it was a Friday afternoon when we went and they were catering to a large wedding rehearsal party, yet they still had the ability to be attentive to us :)  Highly recommend this fun beer house for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Very cool place, but the service was a little slow.  Not saying that made is a bad experience, just that they were a little busy.  The delish haus brat made up for that and the very nice way that our server explained the different types of mustards and ketchups that are house made.  My favorite was the curry ketchup and honey mustard that is made with local organic honey--so good!    The outside patio is lovely but we decided to sit inside where it was more intimate and less surrounded with boozy locals.  Still had a great time and will most likely be going back."}
{"text":"Do you love Beer?  Do you love Brauts? Do you love Bocce?  Do you love Bing Pong (sorry I needed another B word there)?  The Brat Haus is the place for you!  Brat Haus is the kind of place you love to give your money to because they are passionate about what they do.  From the awesome food they serve, to the fact that EVERY beer on tap is served in its appropriate style of glass direct from the brewer themselves, this place gets it right.  My go to items are their cheese curds, the Brat Burger (yum!), there fries with Truffled Aioli sauce (careful, the large fries is HUGE), their home made mustard, and their hand crafted brats.  Their patio is HUGE and is a fun time.  Plus the place is dog friend and dog loved (dogs eat free on Sundays!) so this is a must do on my list of old town.  Only gripe was parking (street only) but now that they have bought the restaurant next door, that is no longer a problem!  Say this in your best Arnold Schwarzenegger voice: GET TO THE BRAT HAUS!"}
{"text":"3 stars for service the crew was on it food well I'm not sure why it get rave reviews total hipster place."}
{"text":"First of all, I love places that have fun thing to do while you're there. I guess I've just never grown out of my child phase.  Anyways, my boyfriend and I stopped in after a day drinking excursion in Old town and thought this place looked cool, so we decided to order a beer and check it out.  So much room for so many activities!!!!  When we stepped outside, there's a couple of games for giant Jenga, corn hole, ping pong and tether ball?! I'm reliving my first year of college with drinking games!  I loved the craft beer selection and the service was great. Everyone was very friendly and knowledgeable. We showed up just a few hours after Germany won and played in the World Cup so we heard it was insane. Wish I would of been there for that!  Unfortunately I haven't tried any of the food, but I'm coming back because 1. I love pretzels 2. I love Nutella AND ITS A FREE CHECK IN DEAL?!?! Why didn't I redeem this while I was there?!?!  Kicking myself."}
{"text":"Sorry, but Brat Haus was average at best and didn't live up to my expectations. I even read several reviews to help decide, and they were all over. So you sometimes just go for it. This time, I should have just passed. Beer - the best part of it all. Nice selection, well served in appropriate glassware, and good. Yes, good beer. Service - this was average, I read the reviews and most are right. A greet upon arrival, a server who shows up, and just ok, not bad but not great. Yes, please order the beer by #s, not the actual name. Food - this was actually the let down. We had the deviled eggs, they were more like mustard eggs. Just way too much mustard. We ordered the knockwurst & boar bbq, both sausages way OVERCOOKED. I couldn't believe it. Both were dry and needed additional sauce, mustard, something. The German potato salad also was a miss, sure maybe their version,  but it was more just cooked potatoes, light on any sauce. Overall, average at best. Wish I had chosen otherwise."}
{"text":"Such a good atmosphere! No longer do you have to sit at a bar outside and stare at the TV.....Brat Haus has plenty of activities to enjoy. From outdoor movies to horseshoes, tetherball and giant Jenga, you can play like a kid again, all while enjoying a sampling from the phenomenal beer list.  Food aint so bad either. Everything is made in house from scratch -- including the baked pretzels and the veggie burger.   Definitely a place to visit in Old Town."}
{"text":"Two words: Pig Mac!  Also tried a great selection of German beers on tap, as well as the fries and pretzels.  Definitely the place to go if you are in the mood for YUM!"}
{"text":"This place was okay.  My brat was decent, but it was supposed to be spicy and it wasn't.  Still tasty though.  Fries were good too.  Bonus points on the huge outdoor patio."}
{"text":"First of all, this is not a German restaurant. The brats are American-style, and the beers are largely regional craft beers. I'd characterize the restaurant as a pretty typical Old Town eatery--it caters to tourists, and the food is so-so. I knocked a star off my rating because the service was very slow, on an afternoon when the restaurant wasn't busy. I tried the spicy brat, and my wife had the beer brat--we both agreed the spicy brat was better. Our feelings are pretty well summed up by her comment, \"It's okay for a trendoid place, but not somewhere I'd go for a good meal.\""}
{"text":"Went for lunch mid-week.  They needed more staff than they had.  Food was fabulous if a little pricey for lunch.  Once order was taken, food arrived quickly.  Will be back when I have time to hang out."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place and hope they work the kinks out, knowing they have only been open for a couple months.  Atmosphere is excellent, especially sitting in the beer garden, a great place to hang and throw a few back.  The food, however, was disappointing as the Brats were good, but not great. I can head to the Pork Shop or Spouts and get a brat just as good, if not better. The meat to bread ratio is off and the specialty brats did not stand out. The highlight here were the fries. They were by far the standout of our meal."}
{"text":"Somehow despite hearing about this place before it opened and being excited to try it out, I'd never made it up there until this past weekend. My friends and I stopped in on Saturday afternoon for a late lunch/early dinner and a couple of beers. We were so impressed with everything about this place - from the service, to the menu, to the tap lineup and the ambiance. It really is an amazing place. They had happy hour on a Saturday from 3-5pm so we were lucky enough to be able to partake in those deals ordered the hummus and the pretzel and cheese to munch on along with our first round of drafts. I love that they have the matching glass for every beer they have on tap, really cool added touch.   For the main course since it was my first time, I went with the brat flight so I could try several kinds of brats plus I added in the beer pairings to match up. It was only $13 bucks and I highly recommend it. Oh and my friends ordered the garlic fries with all 3 kinds of dipping sauces. Those were awesome too. After all that, the place was cheap too! Love this place, I wish I lived closer so that I could join their Mug Club and really become a regular. Check them out, you're gonna be happy you did :)"}
{"text":"This is a really good old town spot to grab a drink and have some awesome food. They have a lot of beers on tap and the staff are very knowledgable and give great recommendations. If you aren't a beer drinker they actually have great cocktails and a good selection of wines. The food here is also great. The pretzel is one of my favs. I usually don't use the cheese that comes with it because they have so many mustards! The brats are also a must have. I haven't had one I didn't like, the sample platter is great to share then you can try a couple varieties. The only reason I knocked off one star is because they got rid of their German potato salad and I miss it so much! BRING BACK GERMAN POTATO SALAD PLEASEEEEEEE"}
{"text":"Overall this place was pretty good! The atmosphere is really fun and funky. The outdoor space is awesome and has lots of lawn games and seating. It would be really nice in the right weather! The cheese curds and pretzels were wonderful, hot, fresh and flavorful! On top of their extensive beer selection, they have a big selection of unique bottles sodas. I tried the butterscotch root beer and it's weirdly delicious!! I was not a huge fan of the bratwurst, HOWEVER I'm not a big bratwurst fan to begin with. So being that I have a bias to begin with, I went for a unique flavor (pepper jack) hoping that it didn't taste like a traditional brat. Still not my favorite, but I think it's my own personal taste. The bun they serve it on is amazing!  The service wasn't stellar, but it wasn't terrible either. I could tell that they were short handed and in need of help, so quite possibly an off day.  Overall a good experience and definitely wanting to return in the future to try more food!"}
{"text":"Just left me with a very happy mouth.  Our dinner was just simply delicious.  My wife and I both enjoyed the wonderful service, our waitress Taylor made our dining experience even happier.  This will become a regular stop on our restaurant circuit."}
{"text":"First visit and I was blown away with how prepared they were for the La Furia Roja soccer supporters group before the first home game of the Arizona United SC season. Literally walked up, ordered food, and was eating within minutes. The beer was flowing if you're into that kind of thing.   The environment is very Euro-beer-garden-outdoor-awesomeness. Who knew that this place was here?! I didn't ... but now I do for sure. Family friendly is always a plus too.  Thank you to Brat Haus for your preparation and execution, I'm looking forward to the next pre-game party as well as visiting for a non-soccer-related meal.  Excellent pretzels Gigantic beer steins Tasty Belgian-style fries Many things to dip said fries and pretzels in Burgers and brats aren't my thing, but other said they were tasty  I didn't ask if I could and where I would order off the menu but I'm sure that's possible as well.  5 stars if the next visit is as good as the first!"}
{"text":"The name of the place can be intimidating if you don't like bratwursts, but there are definitely other options! I ordered the southwest chicken brat, which had a great combination of spices, but I wasn't really impressed. My brother ordered fried chicken, the special for the night. It included one piece of dark meat and one piece of white  meat on a bed of roasted brussel sprouts and potatoes. It was delicious! Overall, I would definitely say the environment and beer trumps the food. The outside is well lit and fenced off with picnic tables all around the place. They have two large Jenga games and cornhole, so it makes it a fun place to be!"}
{"text":"So right off the brat...er...bat, let's take inventory on some of the things that Brat Haus has going for it:   First of all it has bratwurst and other German inspired food and beer. We're talking tons of Brat options as well as some unique custom creations like chorizo, snake & rabbit, on top of other staple German foods like schnitzel etc., and giant pretzels.  Secondly, it has a great biergarten. There's plenty of tables, space heaters, a couple trees, and an area for some games like cornhole, jenga and ping-pong. So basically, plenty of room for eating, drinking and socializing! Perfect!  Thirdly, it's located off the main drag of North Scottsdale Road which has plenty of other local attractions and can provide for plenty of people watching.   Then lastly, it's right next door to Scottsdale's finest brewery, Goldwater Brewing. Which makes Brat Haus perfect for a meal and drink before or after a visit to their neighboring business.  When all of these things are considered, it's hard not to like Brat Haus. Upon my friendly server's recommendation, I went with one of the unique offerings, the \"Snake & Rabbit\" which was literally made of snake and rabbit meat. It was served properly cooked and and with a special sauce to help compensate for a somewhat slightly bland flavor profile of the two meats. Overall it worked pretty well, and was a pretty tasty dish that hit the spot for the most part.  Can't really fault Brat Haus for anything, other than it would nice for them to include sides with the Brats especially when some of the special dishes are up to $13 such as the one I ordered. However, all things considered, you can still get a solid meal here for a fairly reasonable price in a pretty nice area. I'll take that as a win."}
{"text":"Great food yummmmm Super staff friendly and fast  Great mannerism..... Super clean....."}
{"text":"Must-do list of area experiences. Passionate staff and high high quality ingredients. Lots of in-house made products (all brats). Seasonal favors, fun mood and killer patio. Also don't miss the mini-VW bus !!!"}
{"text":"Our friends hosted a 30th Birthday pig roast at Brat Haus (for about 40 people) and we were not disappointed! The staff was very friendly and attentive (even when everyone had had a bit too much of the open bar included in the package).   The giant appetizer pretzels with some sort of cheese dip were great and the pig was beautiful and succulent. The chefs were very forthcoming when presenting the pig and it made the occasion very memorable. Dessert was just okay but by that point, we were too full to appreciate anything more they brought our way.   I would definitely recommend a private party pig roast if you love pork and have a special occasion to celebrate."}
{"text":"Pretzel: pretty good pretzel! Tastes homemade. None of that frozen store crap. Comes with beer cheese which is tasty but I prefer using whole grain mustard!   Wings: wow these wings were tasty! For someone trying to watch their fat figure, it was nice to know these wings were grilled so it's a little healthier! The sauce on top was a great balance of sweet heat....a must try for any wing lover.  Sausage sampler: all three of the sausages were delicious! I don't remember the types they give you, but I liked them equally! The pickled vegetables that come with it are all paired great, but the pickled onions to me were the best! (Sauerkraut was a close second)   The beer selection was great, and the pricing for the menu was pretty descent! That along with the vibes (corn hole, outdoor seating, and live music) gives this place a 5/5 in my book!"}
{"text":"Simply outstanding!  The exact type of location my husband and I have been seeking since we returned from Europe last  year.  The food was portioned perfectly, the beers were excellent and the staff + atmosphere was as close to a beer garden as we have found in AZ.  After one visit we knew we'd be regulars.  PROST!!!"}
{"text":"Based off of food and atmosphere I was going to give this place three stars. I ordered the spicy brat (not actually spicy at all...) and garlic fries. While they were both decent, they were not worth the price they charged. If your restaurant is called BRAT Haus, you better have some better than average brats, which they don't.  The reason I gave this place two stars is because at the end of the meal the waitress brought out all our separate checks. One of my friends left a $10 bill to cover his meal and tucked it in with our credit cards, then he left because he had to go home. When the waitress came back with our credit cards, before she set the checks back down on the table, she says \"oh and your friend who left didn't pay so I don't know how you want to figure out how to pay for him....\" We were all confused because he is not the type of guy to do that and we asked \"are you sure he didn't pay with cash?\" and she replied \"no, it looked like he hadn't even touched his check.\" Anyway, we all agreed we would cover his portion, but then when we opened our credit card holders we found his money that he had placed in there with his check. This was definitely just an honest mistake on her part --- BUT before you go accusing a customer of walking out on a check wouldn't you double check the credit card holders to look for his receipt?? And she never apologized when we pointed out his money had been there the whole time. It's just plain rude."}
{"text":"Nice fun ambiance - good brats! good selection of sausages- nice list of beer!  Great pretzels too!"}
{"text":"So this spot is easily one of my favorite spots in Scottsdale.  The beer list is always revolving and offers a lot of great choices for both novice and dedicated beer connoisseurs.  The starters are basic but in the best way possible, sometimes simplicity is the best mantra.  I have had almost all of the brats and their isn't a dude on the menu.  The staff is also great here, personality is the name of the game and they bring it in spades with great knowledge and trustworthy recommendations that come from people who actually understand what they are serving.  The owner is almost always on site and is friendly and welcoming.  Also if you happen to get Matt B  as a server tell him Jordan says work harder, and give him a good tip."}
{"text":"I am so happy Brat Haus has stuck around Old Town. Such a wonderful place with good eats, great beer and a phenomenal patio! We actually love it so much we had our engagement party out back in April.  I was fortunate enough to attend an yelp event here some time ago which was my first experience as they were trying to generate some traffic. For a place whose name suggests a very meat centric menu, I was impressed with their vegetarian options. Many events cater to carnivores, and while still fun, it was much more enjoyable to sample a larger variety of the menu. The French fries are delicious and it's totally acceptable if not encouraged to have fries and beer as a complete meal. The pretzels were kind of stale at first taste but I've ordered them since and they were much fresher and softer. The mustard options are plentiful! 6 mustard choices deserves it's own star.  The patio truly is one of my favorites in town. Lovely even in the summer (thanks some kind of futuristic uber fan) and provides plenty of entertainment. Our engagement party guests especially loved playing ping pong and tether ball. Our food included veggie sliders, meat sliders, and the kale salad. The veggie sliders were a little underwhelming as far as texture and flavor goes, but overall the food was great. The service is what really soared above expectations. They handled a group of 40 with so much attention and friendliness. I think I may just have my birthday party here as well!"}
{"text":"Why does this place have to be so far away? The brats are amazing. The pretzels are the best I've ever had. And the beer cheese... one day I will learn how make something that tastes as good at home. And then have to start running weekly marathons.  The beer selection is great. There is plenty on tap and the prices are pretty reasonable. Where else can you get a German Oktoberfest on tap in March?  Pretty much everything is made on site. The pretzels, the brats, even the sauerkraut is made here and from local ingredients. If you end up sampling a lot, the price can get high fast but if you just come in for a brat it can be a reasonable lunch."}
{"text":"Love the friendly vibe here!  I believe there are seats indoors, but the outdoor picnic tables are where the party's happening.  Brat Haus has darts, ping pong, and a variety of other outdoor games that you can play while waiting for your food to get done, and they also have a dog-friendly policy which leads to even more mid-meal entertainment.  The restaurant also has daily events, from \"dogs eat free\" days (they seem to have sausages for the dogs as well!) to movie nights.  The food is also killer, and although I didn't try any drinks while here, they also seem to have an extensive beer list as well.  We had an original pretzel with cheese, a sample of the rattlesnake chili (tastes awesome when used as a dip for the pretzel!), and a sweet brat, which is topped with sweet onions and apple (consider adding the root beer onions for more sweetness!).  Delicious.  This is definitely not your standard \"hot dog\" place.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My son and I came here for dinner a few nights ago.  It was our second visit since we moved to the valley.  We chose to be seated outside since the weather was finally cool enough to do so.  This time, I ordered the pretzel appetizer.  It was phenomenal.  Best pretzel on the planet.  My son ordered the spicy brat and garlic fries, and I ordered the burger w/cheese and garlic fries, and we both had beer.    The first time we came here, I ordered the burger because the waitress said they grind their own beef and season it their own way.  I was blown away by the flavor, and was so looking forward to the same experience.  This time I was a little let-down as the flavor was very different.  There were visible seeds in the burger that 'popped' when chewed, and I really didn't like that very much.  (I believe they were mustard seeds.)  The fries were great, except they weren't as garlicky as the first time we were there.    We love the buns at Brat Haus - really the best of any restaurant we've visited.  Service was great, and we didn't feel rushed at all.  Our waiter knew his beers.  And the pretzel is terrific.  I'm sure I'll go back, but just for a pretzel and beer."}
{"text":"Nice place for a family lunch on a beautiful Sunday that we could enjoy the outdoor patio. The food is good not great but good. I had the tri-tip and it was slightly dry and a little chewy. Our server, Nick W was great and had great recommendations. He recommended the pulled pork which my husband had and after trying it I was sorry I hadn't gotten that. The beans were delicious sweet not spicy, and the mac-n-cheese was creamy but could have been cheesier. My mother had the chicken wings, nude and said they were just okay. Her onion rings were good but a little greasier than I would have liked them. They have a good selection of beers. The atmosphere is industrial and very casual."}
{"text":"Used to live in Phoenix, was back in town visiting for a wedding and a friend took us here while out for the night in Scottsdale.  What a great find!  My boyfriend was a HUGE fan of the beers--great selection and so many varieties and sizes to choose from.  The food was incredible!!  We started out with the Fundido--the pretzel was so delicious and dipping it in the beer cheese was the perfect compliment.  My boyfriend had the Haus Brat and tried it with the house-made mustards--simply delicious.  I had the Vegan burger, and I have to say it was one of the best vegan burgers I have ever had for a place that is centered around the Pig and all its forms.  So utterly perfect and delicious and everyone that sampled it at the table agreed the flavors were amazing!  We had a basket of fries to share with the dipping sauces.  So scrumptious.  This place is a must-try and a must-revisit!  We didn't get to sit out on the patio because it was reserved but it looked like a great place to hang out with friends--especially with the great Phoenix weather!    The service was spectacular.  The waiter was super-knowledgeable about all of the beers and offered suggestions when my boyfriend was looking for specific types, etc.  He was also great with being honest about suggestions for food on the menu--I really appreciate the honesty from waiters at restaurants.  He was amazing and our entire experience there was amazing.  We will definitely go back the next time we are in AZ and I will definitely recommend it to friends!!"}
{"text":"I really like Brat Haus!! Met a large group for a birthday party on a Friday night and they seemed to be very accommodating. The patio is gorgeous and the theme is awesome. It feels like you are transported to Germany. We ordered two large pretzels as appetizers and let me tell you they are BIG one is definitely large enough for 4-6 people and the pretzel is delicious. I feel like Old Town restaurants all have this secret contest of who has the best pretzels with cheese. Brat Haus is in the running for sure!   The accordion player was wonderful. He played happy birthday for the birthday girl and we all sang. He was just a nice guy and looked like he was having a great time. It was a great touch!  You really cant beat, awesome pretzels, good beer, good brats and an accordion player!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is better than the food. An outdoor beer garden with twinkle lights is awesome for spring and fall nights in Scottsdale. For kids there's corn hole, huge blocks for building & sidewalk chalk. A big ol' sign on the side of the wall says, \"I wish I had the courage\" with several lines below where diners can add their wishes with chalk.  Food was interesting but hit or miss. Fries with beer cheese sauce and bacon were irresistible. My Molotov Cocktail with green chile vodka, raspberry, lime & ginger beer was good...for about 3 sips. The haus brat was super yummy (for America) but the ginger pork and chicken sausage was small, mushy and grainy. The German potato salad was served warm - which must be how they serve it somewhere in Germany but I've been to Germany three times and was always served a more traditional yellow potato salad. This version was just not for me.  We'll be back, though, hopefully for Oktoberfest or some other celebration!"}
{"text":"Nice spot for lunch or a casual dinner with friends with its low-key atmosphere.  Service was impeccable when we went, really attentive and helpful when we asked questions about top sellers.  It's easy to over-order, as everything sounds so enticing!  The soft pretzel is warm, toasty, soft and lightly chewy (the right kind of chew you'd want from a good pretzel).  Their sliders are nicely portioned and always juicy and tender.  Their brats are good; not too salty, savory, and flavorful.  My husband is a big fan of the Sean sandwich, which is quite filling!"}
{"text":"$12 for a normal draft size Belgian beer.  It's not that much elsewhere in the valley.  Insane.  I feel bad for people who order it without having seen the menu with the prices on it.  Pretzels were fresh, hot, and delicious.  They're not authentic German style ones, by the way, but they are good for what they are.  The grain mustard was a little disappointing because it was so mild.  Fries were delicious.  Glassware is a nice plus.  Parking is even worse than the old Oreganos here because they nixed the interior spots too.  Staff seemed rather ignorant of beers they serve and beer in general, and this place is promoted as a beer destination.  UPDATE: bad service is more common on recent visits, including some attitude from one of the servers for no good reason.  Falafel appetizer was horribly dry and unpleasant on last visit too.    Looking forward to the Union Barrel House opening up next door which is supposed to be a craft beer destination sort of place."}
{"text":"I had been excited to try Brat Haus and it didn't disappoint when my husband and I dropped in last night.  We sat at the bar in the Bru Haus and chatted with the bartender a bit. Their beer selection was amazing: craft brews - most of them on draft but some options in a can as well. They carried some of our favorites: Dogfish Head 90-minute IPA, Bells Two-Hearted, Dale's Pale Ale.  If I remember correctly, prices ranged from $5-8...not terrible and plenty of them were priced at the lower end of the range.They have a very short list of house cocktails (4 or 5) for the non-beer drinkers but I thought they sounded delicious and for a moment I was tempted to order a cocktail instead.  I ordered the Thai Brat with apricot onion chutney. I had been warned that it would be spicy since it contained sriracha but I like some heat so I ordered it anyway. The mix of sweet and spicy was nice, but I will admit that 3/4 of my way through it I had to hand the rest over to my husband -- too spicy. It was almost so spicy that I feared I was missing out on some really good flavors going on in there, but I still enjoyed it. He ordered the Spicy Brat with sauerkraut. The brat was not as spicy as the Thai brat but it was delicious. The bar was lined with ketchup, mustard, curry ketchup, honey mustard, whole grain mustard, and dijon mustard. My husband was happy because he used curry ketchup at home. I like regular ketchup so much that I normally don't use it but it was a nice addition to the Thai Brat.  Fries? A-MAZING! A small order was plenty to split but I could've eaten a large just because it's so hard to stop eating them. You are given a choice of about 8 dipping sauces. We had the bacon bleu-cheese, but all of the options sounded great so it was a tough choice.  We splurged and got dessert. We typically skip this last course, but I had to try the butterscotch root beer float. LOVED IT! Made with vanilla ice cream and Dang's Butterscotch Root Beer, very clever.   The service was great, the food was outstanding. There is something for everyone here. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"So I personally am not a huge fan of the German foods, unlike my wife that loves this stuff. It was date night and I compromise sometimes so we took a visit to this restaurant that was new to both of us. Walking in it was lively, there was a couple guys jamming out on the accordion and don't know what the other thing was but it sounded good. They sat us quickly at this huge long table and honestly it wasn't as intimate as I thought it would be. There was like 4 feet of space inbetween us. We made the best of it though, you just kinda gotta holler at each other. My wife got the schnitzel and I got a spicy brat and she liked the schnitzel and my brat was pretty good but plain (maybe this is expected from german food?). The service was horrible though. We were checked on maybe 2 times in the whole 1.5 hrs we were there. Our water was mostly empty and my wifes beer never got offered to get refilled. As we left the host was playing on her phone not really paying attention to the 2 people standing behind her trying to get a table. She was nice enough to take a second from texting to wish us a good night. Based on service I wouldn't return, if my wife wanted to go back id sit thru it again.... The things we do for our wives....."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and I really enjoy the food! I will not give it five stars because the service is not always very good. one waiter that works there and has attended to myself and whoever I am with is rude and very sassy. I read through the reviews and I think that it is the same waiter that everyone points out for bad service. Other than getting him as a server it is a good place to eat and the atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"what started out really poorly was saved by an excellent manager. we arrived at brat haus around 5 for an early father's day dinner. we were seated, given menus and waters and then promptly ignored for 20 minutes.   we tried to get the attention of a nearby waitress, but she wouldn't turn in our direction. finally, another person in our party went to the hostess stand and asked if we could be waited on. they sent over the girl who had given us our menus and she mumbled nary an apology over a \"server mix up\". even if that were true, there were only 2 other tables near us and at least 2 other waitress assigned to our area. why are you not casually glancing around the room to make sure everyone is taken care of, even if it's not \"your\" table?   anyway, we ordered and were prepared to dislike everything on principle, but the manager who brought over our beers, told us round 1 was on the house due to their mistake and then later sent over a delicious and piping hot pretzel and cheese appetizer for us to try. kudos to them for quickly rectifying the situation.  we each tried a different brat (spicy, sweet, veal and wild boar) and a few different toppings (pickled onions, sauerkraut and a sweet chutney). everyone was very pleased with their selections, i think we just wish the bread was a little more traditional. the various mustards and ketchups that came to the table were great, as were the garlic fries.  all in all, what began disappointingly, ended really well and we will definitely come back again in the future--especially to check out the outside seating when the weather cools down."}
{"text":"This was another lunch trip on my on hour of freedom away from work and a very well spent one.  When we got there it wasn't empty so that's a good sign. We saw the seat yourself sign and found a nice table. It looks like they've got a good amount of room for bigger crowds. Although I'm not 100% sure it looked all outside. This wasn't an issue for us because AZ is great for year round outdoor seating, but this is something to consider on days that you may not want to be outside.  We heard about the very tempting beer selections from our waiter, but decided to skip it since there was the inevitable return to work.   We got the fresh pretzels and beer cheese app to start and two brats. It was all delicious and we left full. The only thing I could have wanted more was fresh pretzel rolls for the brats.   The servers were all nice & knowledgeable, the prices were good for what we got and the food was fast. The latter being crucial for actually fitting outings into a work lunch time frame.   Conclusion: We'll definitely be back. Hopefully for happy hour so I can pair up some beer with the brats and get some good deals."}
{"text":"I hate to do this but I must. We stopped into Brat Haus yesterday on a gorgeous sunny afternoon. Our party of 12 arrived in two sets of 6 diners. We opted for outdoor seating after being greeted in the most reticent of ways. Before I go further, it was NOT crowded! Our server was the most inattentive, unfriendly, and downright surly waitress I have ever encountered. Her defiant disgust was evident from start to finish. We waited 20 minutes for water, another 15 - 20 for our drink orders to be taken. We did split checks, and I know this is not easy for servers or welcome actually, but the rude dismissal is so unnecessary. I can't imagine we're the first group to ask to split the check here. I also understand that 18% was placed immediately on our tabs for service, and she never would have received that tip from me. However, good service would have earned so much more for the effort. Maybe a smile once?? Waters were never refilled, the food was merely passable today, and not one among us thought our service was anything but bad. Two stars today for the beer selection, and nothing else. I know this review won't detract from your popularity, but hey... In the absence of good service, I won't be back to spend my money here when there are so many other choices around town. Oh, and the single ladies' bathroom out back was dirty too. Sorry."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Brat Haus forever, but with so many choices in old town, I hadn't gotten here until today. Well... Now I can say... been there; done that; never again. I met my brother there for a late lunch--it was mediocre at best. Tables in the bar area were sticky dirty and ones in other building not set for service. We sat in the bar building and just avoided putting elbows on table. Lol. (The menus were also filthy with dried mustard and other debris.) We should have left then and gone somewhere that values its customers more. But, undeterred yet, we persevered. To start, we shared a pretzel. It was okay--large but nothing special. There are lots of mustard choices on the table, but most of the house made ones had a weird aftertaste to them. Next, I had the sausage board and my brother ordered a beef dog, as he doesn't generally eat pork. The server brought him sausage by mistake. She was very apologetic and offered to replace with a hot dog, but my brother kept it when he confirmed they would have to throw the sausage out. (He doesn't like to see animal products wasted.) The sausage board was good--each served atop a relish/picked veg. We also shared an order of fries. They were decent but, again, nothing special. Although the server was pleasant, service was pretty awful considering how tiny the place is. At one point, I spilled half my soda. The mess of soaking wet napkins and ice sat in the middle of our table for about 15 min before we could get the bartenders attention to take it away. She never brought fresh napkins, despite asking three times, until my brother went to the counter to get them. (Beware, if you need extra, the replacements are bathroom paper towels.) Finally, we didn't ask for a comp, and my brother did eat the sausage, but it certainly would have been good business to acknowledge the screwup even a bit on the bill, but of course not. All in all, a disappointing experience. Really not sure what the hype is. There are so many fabulous restaurant choices in town, I'd advise picking somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great food. You have to get the pig Mac. The waiter you have to ask for is Mike he was personable and refreshing person to talk to. A little pricey over $50.00 for to Pig mac's, large fries 4 beers"}
{"text":"Great concept poor execution. Bread was stale service included some attitude when we said no to outside that was 110.  Also was restrictive when we asked for more paper towels..... really if u guys want to cost cut or restrict patrons from how many towels they use..... time to close....."}
{"text":"Legit one of the best pretzels I've ever had in my life also has a really cool atmosphere and patio"}
{"text":"Plethora of brats. Cheese curds were the best ive had outside of Wisconsin. There #1 beer is terrific."}
{"text":"From the other yelp reviews some of the burgers sounded to good to pass up.  We shared the Pig Mac Burger which has a sausage patty with a burger patty along with many condiments.  I also had them include a fried egg along with the house specialty hush hush sauce. The burger sounded better than what it actually tasted.   We also got the Brat Burger and an order of garlic fries. The garlic fries were very good and probably the best thing we ordered.   We sat outside on a nice Sunday afternoon and was great with a huge patio area.  As for the hush hush sauce it is a variation of thousand island.   We did not have their specialty items - pretzels,  beer or brats.   Overall I liked the idea but seemed like it was a bit missing."}
{"text":"I was here recently for an event. We had the beer and pretzels. I did not have dinner.   The back patio was so awesome here. The owner was out there for our event and was very friendly. The pretzels were so awesome and the sauce, that I'd go back for them.   I got the San Tan Count Hopula  (sp?) which I loved but when I asked for a second one, it was NOT the same beer. I was very disappointed. I sent it back.  She brought another back and swore it was the Count Hopula but I know that beer. It wasn't. She was adamant. I was disappointed. Pretzels and ambience is 4 stars, waitress and bad beer not so much."}
{"text":"This is a long overdue review.  I must have been having a terrible day when I wrote my review back in 2013.  I'm so glad that Monica suggested Brat Haus for our October 2016 International Supper Club UYE meetup.  I was reminded that I had never returned since I gave them a bratty review.   Well, I enjoyed my meal and the service so much for the October ISCUYE meetup that I went back for lunch yesterday too.  The outside space for this restaurant is simply divine.  Lots of picnic style tables and plenty of shade.  Hands-down, their fried pickles are A-1!  I don't understand how they get the some crispy.  Their Dutch fries are wonderful too.  I'm still figuring out the sausage thing.  While  I love sausage, I was not a fan of the house spicy sausage.  I did enjoy the chorizo sausage.    BTW, they are expanding the business into the building next door (north side) with an extended restaurant called \"Smoke Haus\".  Is that supposed to be German BBQ?  I wonder.  Well, good news is, they have a large parking lot behind that building, so parking should be fairly easy.    I'm going back again, maybe not until the spring, but I'll be back... I still have to have a sausage and beer.  :-)  And I havn't made it to the poutine yet.  But that's on my to-try-list too.  Return Factor 80%"}
{"text":"Such a cool and unique outdoor patio! My favorite beer is the Goulden Carolus Cuv√®e van de Keizer Imperial Dark. (That was a handful to pronounce) It's 75 years old but I'll let you google that... My server was the most adorable redhead Angelina! Great service and keep up the good work! Will be back with friends and family for sure!!!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst sausage I ever had. Ordered hot Italian and it was tasteless and had a huge dry bun.For $10 it was a rip-off.Skip it if you're smart."}
