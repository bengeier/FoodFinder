{"text":"Good service and average pho was average. But the one thing that threw me off was the Che Ba Mau. As the name defines (three colors dessert), we usually are able to distinguish the three colors of this dessert, which consists of coconut milk, red or yellow beans and green pandan leaves jelly. But the one served in this restaurant was plain white. It was impossible to distinguish the presence of any jelly or beans. Also, the \"coconut milk\" they served didn't taste right either. Two of my friends ordered this dessert also and we all didn't feel well halfway through the drink. 
To cut things short, if you are craving a good pho and che ba mau, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I had the Singapore Laksa and for the price it was decent with a nice kick to it. Good for a cold rainy day no doubt. Seating is comfy and it's spacious inside. The menu is quite diverse including cuisine from Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam."}
{"text":"Saw the sign for Phò and Vietnamese food and had high hopes.  First warning that this would be disappointing came from the menu,  which was in French, English and Chinese; no Vietnamese. Second warning also came from the menu, which contains sections for Vietnamese, Singaporean,  Malay and Chinese food.  

Third warning was from the staff,  who were speaking Chinese amongst themselves.

Despite the name, this is a generic \"Asian\" restaurant,  not a phò restaurent.

But we ordered the food we were looking to eat; Phò and a vermicelli dish.

The food was terrible. Watered down fish sauce. Weakly marinated grilled chicken. Wimpily pickled carrots and white radishes. The \"Rare\" beef in the soup,  which was anything but rare when it reached the table, was tough and stuck together. I don't think there was any brisket and the soup was bland.

Nothing had any taste! Don't be afraid or too miserly to use spices and flavoring to your dishes!"}
{"text":"Ordered dumplings and a large beef ball soup, both were hot, well-presented and the chili oil made the soup easy to season to desired spice. Yum. Peaceful, yummy lunch."}
{"text":"I used to go at this restaurant everytime when I lived in Montreal. 

The place is very clean and calm. The restaurant is very decorated and it's nice to have TV's  with big screens, showing you the score of the last hockey game... 

But let's back to the subject : I always took the PHO soup, the one with rare beef. It tastes excellent. So good that I usually ask myself if they don't abuse of so much glutamate (it makes you become food addictive and it's very bad for the health)... The service is ok... even if the girl only cares about $ and not the clients feelings. A little bit expensive (around 14$ to have spring rols + a medium soup)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, the restaurant is clean and spacious, but food is just average. I would give it a 3.5 if I could."}
{"text":"Delicious food and good service. 
Must try #13 (Tokinoise soup), #54 Curry Beef (Malay style). 
Not much selection for appetizers but Fried dumplings and Tempura are good.

Accepts all major credit cards. 
moderately priced around $10 for a dish.
Decor is nice and service is quick and warm"}
{"text":"honestly I was a little wary at first before coming here after reading the other reviews, but it's pretty good!

Got the rare beef pho, and it came quickly with a lot of beef and the bean sprouts/garnish. Also the beef actually WAS rare so that's pretty satisfying. 

Obviously it's not \"100% AUTHENTIC VIETNAMESE!!!!!!!\" but it is located in a touristy area,  downtown Montreal so I wasn't expecting that.

Also the ice coffee was great! Service, cleanliness and variety is all good too. 

Definitely satisfied my pho craving."}
{"text":"I come here all the time for pho, their rare beef is delicious and super tender. I always order the rare beef on the side so it doesn't cook too fast in the broth and they always give such a large portion"}
{"text":"My fiance and I came here while we were just walking the streets of downtown and just stumbled upon this place. Since my fiance was craving Vietnamese food for a late lunch, we decided to come in here (but there are so many Vietnamese restaurants all around this area, so really hard to pick one). 
There was actually another table inside when we came in (we walked close to 3 pm... I said it was a late lunch). We were acknowledged by an employee immediately and were instantly seated at a clean table. My fiance ordered beef pho and I ordered chicken with broken rice, which is one of absolute favorite dishes. 
Not too longer after ordering was both of our meals brought out to us. The food came out nice and hot and just delicious (and I am not just saying that because we were both pretty hungry). 
The owner had some small talk with us and we found out that the owner and his wife are Chinese from Vietnam and so they also speak both Cantonese and Vietnamese here (and of course English as well). The owner and his wife, along with the other employees here, were very friendly and just gracious. The service was quick and attentive. What else could you ask for in a restaurant? 
Excellent food at excellent prices. I would love to come back here again the next time I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"I love the broth they have for the pho, tastes homemade to me. Tasty hot soup is soothing for a cold Canadian winter day."}
{"text":"A mix of Vietnamese, Singaporean, Thai, and Malaysian cuisine...
Yeah, I don't know the theme of the place either.

The waitress recommended a sour coconut fish soup to my friend, which tasted weird... Their pho is below average with very small portion, and the service had hardly any presence."}
{"text":"outside doesn t look very attractive, not to say cheap. Just push the door! Inside is above expectation for a restaurant at that price.
Service was nice, fast.
Choice of food is large enough, very tasty and really affordable.
$10 tip included for what he had is a great value for money."}
{"text":"I ate here today for lunch as I have been in Montreal on business. I ordered the large bowl of cooked beef Pho ($7.50 CAD) and thought it was delicious. The place was very clean and the staff were quite pleasant.

Next time I'm in the area, I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"Service was quick, but quality wasn't great. It's a fusion place, the pho may be OK but the thai food was a little off base. The lady was nice, has a lot of people going here. I wish I knew what their expertise is."}
{"text":"The most memorable dish from my Pho Saigon experience was the dessert: fried vanilla ice cream drizzled in honey. It's massive, so unless you've got some wild and out of control munchies, share this amongst friends. The rest of the food is good, especially the Tonkinoise soup. Apart from that, I'd say it's nothing out of the ordinary.

Quick and attentive service too, what more could you ask for when you're looking for some decent Vietnamese food in the area?"}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent for soups, I don't recommend anything else because they are mostly generic Asian food! they don't have anything with lemongrass on the menu which was disappointing and additionally the staff are not helpful with menu as most can barely speak English"}
{"text":"We were going to Kazu but it was closed for their winter vacations and we entered into Saigon VIP to escape from the cold (-20). I was so happy when I saw Laksa on the menu. I fell in love with this authentic Malay dish in Kuala Lumpur, at a restaurant called Precious. Unfortunately, I was not satisfied with the one I had at Saigon VIP. The mussels weren't fresh, the squid was way too rubbery, the broth wasn't flavourful enough to my liking. 

My bf had the mie goreng. It was better than my dish, but still, nothing complex. 

My server came with first the mie goreng and gave it to me saying it was laksa. He had no idea what he was serving."}
{"text":"On a un peu toujours une impression de déjà vu quand on entre dans un resto de pho. Le décor dépouillé, les cuillères à soupe, les baguettes et les sauces en libre service à la table, le service expéditif et les prix raisonnables. Pho Saigon n'échappe pas à ces règles. Pour moi, une \"pho\" est du «comfort food»  et le manque d'originalité de la formule est presque bienvenue dans ce contexte. Une formule de chaîne sans être une chaîne?

Toujours est-il que la zone de Ste-Catherine Ouest où se situe \"Pho Saigon VIP\" foisonne de ces restaurants et à jusqu'à maintenant, cette adresse est ma favorite dans ce secteur. Le bouillon de la Pho était bien réussi, mais les rouleaux qui complètent la formule midi étaient plus moyens. De plus, ils ne servent pas les rouleaux impériaux avec une feuille de laitue, ce qui me déçoit à chaque fois que je mange une Pho à Montréal... Y en a t-il qui servent les rouleaux correctement dans cette ville?"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. The service was ok but they actually ask for tip every time. Didn't mention that they take bottle rights on wine and almost charged us. Basil is not even served with your soup and whenever u ask for it, all u get is one stem. I don't understand how that place gets 5 stars"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times in the past week, and will likely continue going (though maybe less often when seasonal depression lifts, but that is not a reflection on the restaurant and more a reflection on how hard it is to be a person in the colder months).

Service is really fast; I received my food in what felt like under five minutes! The staff are also nice as well and didn't make me feel weird for dining alone and ordering a bunch of food for Me, Myself and I.

In terms of specifics, the green curry chicken was excellent, as was the coconut soup. Rolls were what I expected rolls to be. I liked the vermicelli dishes as well, though they weren't as flavourful as some other places I've been to (Pho Tay Ho comes to mind). Still, this is a solid option for Vietnamese food in the area."}
{"text":"I don't usually give bad reviews. The only reason I'm putting a star here is because of how nice the waitress was. I ordered a Tom Yum soup dinner format. I was very disappointed, not by the broth but by the rawness of the chicken and the noodles. I saw the usual line for Kazu on my way here and I told myself i was making a hood move. I guess I was wrong."}
{"text":"Go for the laksa if you really can't decide ! Any laksa (singapore, vip), doesn't matter, they all taste good. Never been disappointed with the laksa and it was my third time eating laksa there. After the main meal, I like to eat the fried banana. The price is a tad expensive though ($6.95), considering the simple process of making it.

Service wasn't so bad. Could have been better. The best thing they do is that they refill your water without you having to ask. The worst thing is that their tip options go by 15%, 20%, 25%. You can't pay tip lower than 15%. I notice many Asian restaurants do that in MTL. Anyway, I wouldn't mind going to this place again...maybe in a couple of months."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about the food, it is pretty damn good! The service should be improved. I'm never impressed by the service of vietnamese restaurants which makes it hard for me to give them more than 3 stars. It's a nice place to enjoy the food- only the food."}
{"text":"Dependable place, dunno why the name is pho cause they have a mix of everything. I like to come if I'm just out of ideas and need something satisfying"}
{"text":"The pho soup was lukewarm when served and wasn't able to fully cook the beef slices thoroughly. The service was good enough but I did have an unwelcome surprise when the cap of the sirracha bottle fell off. However, the pricing is quite fair and the portion is good for it."}
{"text":"The food quality has worsened a lot in recent months. Must be a new chef. Almost every dish has less taste and less meat. Too bad."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here as I live nearby and it's the best Vietnamese option in the neighbourhood.

I usually go for the vermicelli bowls, as I think it's the dish this place does best -- sometimes the grilled chicken pho - which, unusually, is better than their beef pho! 

My flatmate often orders the #9 - chicken curry w/ roti - which is in the appetizer section (and priced as such!) despite being a main-sized portion :)  

Decor is a bit nicer/cleaner than your average Viet joint, too.  
Although I wish they would get rid of the TV playing sports all the time - really doesn't suit the place. 

Service is friendly!"}
{"text":"Was trying to go to Kazu...but wasn't going to wait in line.  Decided to settle for this place close by... Defiintely not settling.  I had the #25 the Laksa Seafood Soup.  Spicy  goodness especially on a cool rainy and dreary day.  Good selection. My food was tasty.  Prices decent. Can't speak for anything else."}
{"text":"I had a craving for vietnamese food, and decided to try this out on a recommendation. Truth is, I haven't felt too well for quite some time, so I decided to find a take-out resto.  Asian food is my comfort food.

I'm happy to say that I really did like this choice. I got a round of a few different things, so that I can go with leftovers tomorrow for lunch. I tried  dumplings with peanut butter sauce. These were unlike many others in this city that I have tried.  They had a bit of spice to them, and not disgustingly sweet and sugar-granular tasting, you can taste, a hint of cilantro in them too. The dumpling wrapper (or dough) tasted fresh, and not overcooked, or left out too long. I also tried a pan-fried dumpling, which was actually close to the filling that my mom made for me as a kid. It will never replace hers, but the fact that they reminded me of hers, is a pretty huge compliment. Added bonus was they weren't fried out of recognition, which sometimes tends to happen. 

I tried a couple of bites out of a spring salad roll with shrimp, the the mint was the hero in this, along with fresh shrimp of course. It was perhaps too vermicelli intensive, (I would have appreciated a little less so it didnt feel like it overpowered the shrimp.) The dipping sauce was, I admit different. very different, and surprising, but I can't say if it is good surprising. It had a distinct taste of plum sauce mixed into it, which is not normal. I've had hoisin, peanut hoisin, bean and hoisin, and straight up fish sauce and sweet chili, but plum sauce with hoisin is odd. I cant however say it was disgusting tho, just not what I am used to.

I also ordered a typical grilled chicken with vermicelli (called bun) with an imperial roll.  The imperial roll is vegetarian and quite big compared to other restaurants, and crispy, and the grilled chicken is juicy and not overcharred, but as it stands I have taken a bite out of everything and I am way to full.   

When I am sick, I feel indecisive, and when I order food feeling this way, I've come to the realization that I just have food for the entire next day.  It satisfies my true essence, which is to be able to have a little bite of everything.

So overall,  Im glad that my meal didn't suck, and for the most part I can honestly say it was quite good. I think that the meal was fresh, and I also like that I could still taste flavours layered over other flavours. As for cost, it was quite reasonable considering that I technically have 3 meals left over all for only $30.50 (not including tip of course)"}
{"text":"We came here because Kazu was too long of a wait. The food was very disappointing, for four people. 
The best dish was the tofu/vegetables; reasonably seasoned. 

The worse dish was #67 - beef with onion. They charged an extra 2$ for the white rice, but this seemed to have been advertised as part of the meal. There was too much consistency like 

The crab soup was not great. Too much ketchup like taste. The vermicillii was decent. There was no flavour nor mint leaves, nor other vegetables than tomatoes. 

The ice coffee was not drinkable; so strong it was not drinkable."}
{"text":"Tasteless

Ordered tofu, eggplant, and basil. Had no flavor.
Also, saw a shrimp tail on the floor. 

Had low expectations and they were met."}
{"text":"I'm not a Vietnamese food connoisseur, or a dumpling connoisseur, or a Ph connoisseur. But I love Vietnamese cooking. I've had better fried dumplings, but these were better than most. But I'm biased; I pretty love any kind of dumplings from any culture. Food wrapped in as dough, WIN. The beef ribblets were perfectly grilled and had a sweet after taste and I could have eaten a pound of that stuff as well as with the pickled carrots with daikon which there was too little of. I don't know much about Ph other than how to correctly pronounce it but this shaved raw beef Ph was really delicious for my inexperienced Ph-palate. Plus how awesome is hoisin sauce? And of course ending with Pisang goring aka Fried Banana, always a plus. Pho Saigon VIP is a good pit stop after movies at the former AMC theatre and a good place for a quick, healthy and inexpensive lunch with work friends in a clean restaurant with some snappy service."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular, but if u are near by and feel like having pho, then is a good choice. Banh xeo was well made specially for a fusion place. The decor was lacking of life."}
{"text":"Went for a nice bowl of pho on this cold winter winter with 2 of my friends and the portions were good! I was actually full after my XL pho for once. The soup tasted less chemical and very homemade which is a plus."}
{"text":"According to my friends, they want to try everything on the menu. 
This time four of us tried traditional pancake  of Vietnam, shrimp dry pho , tomato crab rice noodle and laska. The pancake is more expensive than other dishes but it worth a try. Nothing like what I have eaten before."}
{"text":"I like this place only because their spicy pho soups are really good and I keep coming back for more each time. It's one of my favorite restaurants. I don't know what the other food on the menu tastes like because I only order pho soup.

The place is also near place which is convenient and also, the service is alright. They never screw up my order and usually serve me as soon as I get in the place. 

The prices are not so bad as well. Thumbs up from me!"}
{"text":"had the pho here like 6-7 times

it's good pho, not the best I've had in MTL but better than the other places in the area

what stood out to me here is the service, some of the staff are extremely kind, considerate, and overall very good servers

pho is a solid 8/10
service is a 10/10 (depending on who waits on you)
atmosphere is 8/10 - it's nice and usually quiet, but the decor isn't super nice or fancy 

My friend had another dish once and it wasn't great, definitely come here for the pho

overall, this place is pretty pho-king great hehe"}
{"text":"Worst one I ever been to..!!!! Food is just gross... my wife is vegetarian and I ordered everything in vegetarian. Guess what everything has meat in it. Screw it. Never come back again!!!!!"}
{"text":"The phõ here is authentic and tastes really good! The broth won my heart a thousand times and the com Suon bi cha with cha gio was amazing and filling as well! For the phõ, I wish they had more noodles and meat; I feel like this place skimped out on that, otherwise, they got the traditional taste of the broth just right!"}
{"text":"Plenty of competition on this stretch of Montreal's Ste Catherine with a lot of emphasis on Asia. We stubbled on to this one since we wanted something light and ready to serve.

The decor was simple.it should actually think of doing a Reno given that there are a lot of competition which are more pleasing to the eye. Their menu featured over 30 dishes so they had a good selection. However, by quickly looking over the selection, it didn't seem to have a  lot of imagination and when we got  our meals, it was typical of what we usually get at Pho restaurants. The service was fast and our waitress was quite polite which was great since we wanted to go back to the downtown core right away. More like a 3,5 stars. A traditional Vietnamese resto $-$$"}
{"text":"I always go here for Pho! Their Pho is amazing and probably the best one I've ever had out of all the Pho places I've been to in Montreal! The staff are really friendly too! Their menu is pretty big, they have other dishes as well but I've never tried them but i'll be sure to try them soon! If you want delicious and tasty pho, I recommend that you come here!"}
{"text":"I think Saigon VIP may try to cater to too many people - for a great experience at Saigon VIP I would suggest listening to the waiter's suggestions for house / chef specialties. There are house specialties that are perfection on a plate. Try their pancake for example. I am extremely picky, and have never been let down by the chef's suggestions. It's too bad that the menu is so diverse because it's true, they probably don't do everything well. The menu is just too big! They should scale down the menu to their top sellers and chef specialties and maybe a few seasonal options that change once in a while."}
{"text":"The service was okay, nice and friendly staff. The food was sometimes good, depending on what you order. The fried tofu and sweet sour fish fillet were great IMO. I did try fried rice here once, and it was meh...Price is reasonable though."}
{"text":"Disappointing, to say the least. We went here to try the pho, and got some with everything they offered, but alas, we were in for a surprise. The service was very slow, and when we finally got the pho, it 'looked' bland, and upon tasting, was astonishingly blander. Further, there were only about four pieces of meat and a piece of processed sausage in both of ours, but the worst part was the long hair in the soups mixed in with the noodles, or vegetables, or whatever (we both have short hair). No apologies from staff."}
{"text":"This was a last min visit as I got to my account earlier than expected, so decided to walk around as I didn't know there is this small Asian town full of restaurants just few blocks away from where my customer is.

Looked up yelp and actually went to 2 other restaurants before here....reason didn't go to the first 2 was due to cash only as I only have USD and credit card.  

Anyway, this restaurant was close by and I'm always up for a good pho on a cold misty day.  And they take credit card.  I ordered the shrimp spring rolls and large combination pho.  Overall, it was just the standard pho.  I really couldn't tell you anything great or bad other than that it's your basic pho as expected.  Only thing I recall was the tripe was in larger pieces and should have been cut into smaller pieces to chew on.  Aside from that, it's all good.  

As I paid and was leaving, the owner shouted out if I was Vietnamese?  Not sure why as most Asian actually think I'm more Korean.  Oh well."}
{"text":"you know what? This is one of my favorite places to eat, I always recommend it to friends everything is delicious and my favorite is the Thai style fried rice with chicken,shrimp, and pineapple. went there a few weeks ago and I almost choked on a piece of wood. When I showed the server, she took it to the kitchen to show the cooks. She later returned and explain that it was a piece of wood that broke off a tool they used to clean the woks. she said sorry, the cashier said sorry,  and I forgave them. no discounts or anything was offered to me to make it up to me. Their calmness was probably what bothered me the most. Maybe they don't care that I could have choked? Maybe it happens all the time?"}
{"text":"Delicious, easy meal! Kind and helpful staff. Great prices! Nothing fancy,good for a casual date. The pho and green curry were very tasty!"}
