{"text":"Would not recommend delivery. Maybe the food is better in-house, but to me the ingredients seem too low of quality for the price. For example all the meat appears to pretty low quality. Some of the food is pretty good here, but for me personally there are too many other restaurants in Madison that use much higher quality ingredients in the same price range for me to get delivery again."}
{"text":"Quite tasty (by Wisconsin standards) but a bit pricey for what it is.  
Still, the specialty rolls are fabulous, especially the firehouse roll."}
{"text":"We were so excited to have kitschy Hibachi style food, with the theatrics that go with Hibachi style dining. Our chef was not a showman in the least. No bits or tricks, just boring plain old cooking. The food was ok, bit there doesn't need to be butter and teriyaki sauce on everything. I ordered two of the same drink, but received two very different drinks in flavor. I won't be going to Edo Gardens again!!!!"}
{"text":"Edo is excellent!  My fiance's boss took us out on Saturday night and it seems they have expanded the menu.  We've been there before, but it only seems to have gotten better.  Since I am allergic to shellfish (most kinds, and some other crustaceans) I am somewhat limited in experience.  I highly recommend the Dragon roll and the new Rock n' Roll.   Some people had the Lobster hibachi and shrimp teryaki.  I tried a wee bit o the lobster and found it was delightful, and only caused minor discomfort for a few minutes (well worth it:)  A very comfortable restaurant with good service and delicious food.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Great Japanese restuarant, and I believe they deliver anywhere in Madison! I live at least 5 miles away (NorthSide!), and they deliver in 45 minutes on a large order of food!  

As far as the food goes, it is high quality.  My favorites include the spicy tuna roll, the Dragon roll, and the Ikura (salmon roe).  Probably the best sushi/sashimi value in Madison.

I've only eaten in the restaurant once, but it has beautiful woodwork, a fancy sidebar and sushibar, and excellent service."}
{"text":"Last night was one of those nights where I felt entirely too unmotivated to actually leave my apartment in the pursuit of a meal. After a bit of searching, stumbled upon Edo. A Japanese restaurant that delivers? Heck yes.

After waiting about an hour and a half for my food to somehow wander hopelessly across Madison to my door, we hungrily tore into our brown paper delivery bags.  my boyfriend and I were disappointed with the quality of food - especially considering it was on the pricier end.

My boyfriend reported that the gyoza were ok, however the chicken and steak hibachi came absolutely drowning in some vague, tasteless sort of sauce. Seriously. The tupperware container it came in was half full of some grayish sort of horrible hibachi stew that was miraculously flavorless. Unfortunately, the blandness somehow permeated the meat - how can you make FLAVORLESS MEAT?! :(

I ordered the Spicy Tuna Bowl and a Spicy Tuna Crunch roll - unfortunately both came absolutely covered in tasteless, manufactured tempura flakes. These were not the crispy delicious tempura flakes that I have found at both Ginza and Takumi here in Madison, but rather the bland, crumbly white sort that you shake out of a can from the grocery store. Paste-flavored, gritty and disgusting. You couldn't even taste the tuna - or spicy mayo beneath the sea of absorbent, kitty litter tempura.

The spicy tuna bowl would have been a delicious idea - had it come with some sort of dressing that I could detect, had not been absolutely buried beneath the tasteless tempura grit and if the lettuce had not been of questionable quality at best.

Save your money and your time - get out of the house and go find some real food."}
{"text":"I gave this place a shot a few months ago because it was the only place I could find open past 11:30pm that served sushi on a Friday.

I was pleasantly surprised.  The food here is fantastic and so is the service.  My server was very friendly and it didn't take very long to get my order.  

I have since become a regular here, and it's become one of my favorite Japanese food spots in Madison."}
{"text":"i have an annual 'problem' relationship with edo. i order delivery for days in a row, and then i stop because of something they forgot, or they took to long, or i realize i'm spending too much money on takeout.

that said, they're pretty consistent with presentation and taste. i'm usually good at figuring out which day of the week a sushi place gets their fish delivery (making the day before that a relatively bad one on which to order), but i haven't been able to pinpoint edo's delivery day.

you can get 4 rolls for under $20 right at your front door! the fish is of a good texture, and as long as they don't forget the wasabi, i'll not be disappointed."}
{"text":"First of all, let me say that the food here is pretty good, but not great. Maybe average at best. We don't have a lot of delivery options for sushi, and this place does deliver, so we have ordered online from them 4 times, and our average order has been over $45, and we added on a 20% delivery tip before receiving the food. (Being optimistic and knowing delivery drivers don't make much.) The first time our order was great, and everything was good. Yay! We were excited that we found a sushi place that had decent food and delivered to us.  The second time we ordered sweet shrimp and they sent the heads raw. Yes, I said raw! Cold and slimy and raw!! I emailed the restaurant and asked if this was normal practice, and I never heard back from them. The next order, one of the items we ordered was a hand roll, which is an option online. They give you the option to order either a hand roll or a regular roll.  We chose a hand roll, and we received a regular roll. This time I called to complain that I got a regular roll instead of a hand roll, and I asked to speak to the manager. The manager came on the line and said to me, \"Well, you are kind of far away and you did want separate containers for things, so you shouldn't complain.\" Really?? She told me I could have 10% off the next time I actually came into their restaurant and ate there. Nice . . . not! Once again, tonight, I ordered, to try one last time to see if we would get what we wanted. We ordered a hand roll and several other items, and once again, we got a regular roll. The rolls that we ordered were just okay, nothing special. I will not be ordering from this restaurant again."}
{"text":"We went on saturday night. It was near empty. The sushi was average at best- too much crunchy rice. The waiter was some dumpy guy that was so slow and lazy. I can not believe he was ever hired. He needed to be reminded to actually bring us our drinks. He told us it would not be possible to order spicy tuna without the crunch. Ihave been eating sushi long enough to know that it is possible to make the spicy tuna roll without crunch."}
{"text":"Love the California Roll and Miso Soup, cheap prices too."}
{"text":"The sushi is good - as long as  you don't get the \"Spicy - what ever\" (tuna) rolls. The roll came as tuna mushed up with panko and NO spice. The crunch would have been fine if it had been expected - ie should have been listed in the menu description. The other rolls were great. Also this was a delivery order came, on time with no problem."}
{"text":"I had the Chicken Teriyaki Bento Box delivered. Very clearly imitation crab in the California rolls. Quality of the chicken and tempura was subpar. The rest was just bland. Good customer service and presentation but food needs some work."}
{"text":"The staff is incompetent, I will never go here again. The sushi is mediocre at best -- there are much better Japanese restaurants in Madison, stay clear of this one. Way better options would include Takara, Red Sushi, Muramoto - take your pick."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from this place - about $35 worth of sushi and food. When the delivery driver came to our apartment I asked for change on $40 and I was going to give him a tip. The delivery driver (shorter asian man) started YELLING at me about how he drove across town and he couldn't believe I was going to give him less than a $5 tip. Are you kidding me sir? I don't technically have to tip you at all! The guy was extremely rude and I will NEVER order from this location again. Tip: Go to the Edo location on Monona drive! They have always been great and have awesome customer service!"}
{"text":"I ordered at night ....they delivered in 20 min!! And the food is beyond expectation. 
Definitely great experience."}
{"text":"Only visited once, so take that into consideration.

The rolls and the nigiri were good and the veg. tempura was humongous and mouth burning hot, but that's just about every japanese place.  The service was a bit slow, but nothing horrible.

A few minor issues, one, the container of soy was impossible to pour without spilling.  Also, I'm not sure how I feel about the giant reusable plastic chopsticks.  On the one hand they are helping the environment by not using disposable bamboo, but on the other hand, I'm concerned about reused utensils that are not metal.  

Anyway, good food, not the greatest location, worth a visit."}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery from here. Overall I am disappointed. I got the magic roll, avocado roll, and philadelphia roll. The philly roll is mostly cream cheese, very very very little salmon. The rice is also very thin. The magic roll is forgettable. The rolls overall are very small for the price. Delivery service was fine, just really wish the sushi was better.

Update: If you order the hand rolls they give you a ton of fish. They will call you to confirm that you know the roll is like a ice cream cone. Whenever I feel like I need a ton of salmon I order hand rolls from here now. 

So if you order here, get the hand rolls!!!"}
{"text":"I ordinarily never write reviews on these sites, but I have to say I am shocked that this place is ranked lower then some of the other Madison-area sushi restaurants.  I have to say this place has the 1st/2nd best sushi in town (and good compared to San Francisco sushi, which is my benchmark).  I normally order sashimi, sushi, and variety of rolls and they have all been good.  I have not had any issues with the service. 
I think this place is very underrated.  If I had not found out about Edo through a friend. I don't think I would have ever gone since I normally get an idea of restaurants through yelp ratings."}
{"text":"Went yesterday (Friday) right at 5pm to grab a quick bite with a friend. There were 4 staff people that we saw. Had to ask for water and menus, had to ask for the wine list, and then it took over 5 minutes to get 2 glasses of wine! Ordered sushi and honestly, it was awful, absolutely tasteless. Told them we were in a hurry, our food sat up on the counter for about 3-4 minutes while our \"waiter\" was playing on the computer and the other 2 staffers were chatting. We kept looking at them trying to get their attention. No excuse since we were the only 2 people in the restaurant. Im surprised I didn't get food poisoning!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time by ordering a lunch special sushi and was very disappointed. There was plain mayo squeezed all over everything - not in an appetizing way - and the quality of the rolls was very subpar.  I was hoping to find a new sushi place, and this is definitely not going to be it."}
{"text":"My daughter and I have met for lunch many times at Edo. We were always pleased with the food and the service. Our last visit changed our minds. Roughly 15 minutes after leaving, my daughter began to \"feel funny\". She started turning deep red in her face and neck and her arms felt strange. I rushed her to the ER thinking she must have been allergic to something we weren't aware of. (She has no allergies, otherwise.) 
It turns out she had Strombrotoxin poisoning, caused by raw tuna not being stored at proper temperatures. They gave her a few IV's of antihistamines, but not before she got really bad. Her blood pressure, her heart rate, and by then, her eyes were completely bloodshot. At the end of the day she's fine.  Being a new mom of a 2 month old, it was very, very concerning how rapidly she became sick. She had to stop breast feeding for a few days, too. Mom and baby are fine. 
She had tuna sashimi, the cause of the toxin. I had nothing but Miso soup and tea. 

I also want to add that when we left the restaurant, their delivery guy was blocking all the cars in the tiny lot. When he finally decided to come and move the van, instead of pulling out, he inched further in! The only way to leave was to inch back and forth until we could clear the other cars in the lot. (If you've ever seen their lot, you'll understand how cramped it is.) I thought he was rude to not back out, especially once he saw how difficult it was to maneuver out. 

I will miss the fresh food, but it only takes one time of being served rotting fish and a medical scare to turn us off completely. It's just not worth the risk."}
{"text":"I always have great food!! But the service and caring of these people is beyond words! I had a problem with being locked out of my vehicle and they over extended themselves to help me and I will pay this kindness forward!! Thank You, AL?"}
{"text":"I absolutely love going to this restaurant, I've been working on going to all the sushi restaurants in Madison and so far this is one of my favorites! 

The sushi is delicious, and the service is great. Not to mention prices are affordable, I look forward to going here more often."}
{"text":"Order delivery promised in 50 min.  Now more than double that still no food and no answer @ the restaurant.  Two hungry kids and i cant even tell them when we can eat. Beacase employees  wont even answer the phone."}
{"text":"Yum, I don't know how it get's better than a sushi place that delivers. I've never had anything I've ordered taste less than fantastic*."}
{"text":"Our waiter was one of the most genuinely happy people I've encountered in weeks, for real!  He was super sweet, attentive, and actually seemed true in his happiness level, not an ounce of fakeness to be seen.  I liked the ambiance of this place - soft lighting, shiny wood floors and tables.  One caveat was that they had a radio station playing as the background music (meaning you also hear dj's and ad's).  May I suggest... a cd or an ipod?

The menu was pretty extensive, with more vegetarian rolls offered than I'm used to - approximately 10 choices.  And all in the $4 range!   There was no shittake mushroom (wah wah) but the sweet potato tempura roll was quite good, along with the rainbow roll (asparagus, avocado, cucumber).  $1.75 for tea, which was bottomless.  Food was nicely presented, although I always wish restaurants would do that final touch of wiping the rim of plates before they leave the kitchen so you don't see finger prints all over them.  (Can you tell I used to work in a restaurant where we were rather diligent about this?!)  

Overall, nice atmosphere, easy street parking, decent prices, great service, and good food makes this a place to which I'd happily return."}
{"text":"Sad food. Dirty windows. Cold tea. Poor response to complaints. 

I had lunch at Edo and was very disappointed. While nearly empty, service took time. When the tea arrived it was barely lukewarm. 

Taking cues from the dirty windows, I only ordered cook food bento box (I love sushi, so this was already a compromise). The salad was yellowed ice berg. Bitter and old. The shrimp were overly chewy, the vegetables cold. 

When I told the waitress that my food was not warm, she took my plate and placed it down a couple tables away. Another waitress returned and said she saw the chef cook it. At this point I was afraid what would happen if I lost sight of the plate. FINE, I said, just give it back (now even colder than before).

Did I mention that the ginger was limp and soggy?

Never again!"}
{"text":"Sashimi is pricey, and even if it's bad, extracting my full value trumps quality for me. But this place broke my tolerance. I ordered a sashimi combo (dozen random pieces), plus udon, and it was so bad that I couldn't finish. The fish clearly had been over-frozen, and parts tasted rubbery and gross. The udon felt like it came straight from Asian Midway Foods 99-cent section (and probably did)!! With so many decent sushi options in Madison -- at around the same price -- why would you waste your hard-earned dollar here?! GROSS."}
{"text":"Went here on a Tuesday evening and it was pretty dead. Three of us shared a Edo Loveboat and it was just the right amount of sushi/sashimi/rolls. The fish was fresh and they didn't skimp on the choices of fish. The rolls didn't knock my socks off, but they certainly weren't the worst I had in town. The service was excellent (our server split the salads and soups three ways, even though the order only came with two) and the sake passable. Ranks better than many sushi places in town (ie: wasabi, sushi hut, takara) but I didn't care for how Americanized the rolls were."}
{"text":"Meh....  I had sushi for lunch. The presentation was lovely but the sushi was quite mediocre. The rice was heavy and the fishi lacked the clean fresh flavor I love at Red Sushi Grill or Murimoto at Hilldale. It reminded me of supermarket sushi. I have eaten here before and had much the same experience."}
{"text":"Takeout! Good scallion pancakes. Adequate sushi. Terribly confusing pick up experience. Not so much for me, but for the poor host as I kept repeating that I was here for pick up until it worked. 

Not in the nicest neighborhood in town, based on creepers at the daybar next door. Though that might be changing with the shiny new apartments going up over there."}
{"text":"Continuing being my favorite place to get sashimi and deliveries. Just need to update another great review for them as a big thank you to the whole team over there! From the kitchen to the friendly delivery people! As a very particular and picky person,I am always grateful to find things that works for me.  Edo on Park St fits into my little life here in Madison ever since I discovered it, and I know it will always be when I am here!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!!!! Their waitress seriously need more training or just more manners!!"}
{"text":"Nice quiet space for lunch.  Roll was good. Sushi was very good. The ebi was fresh and served atop thin lemon slices giving it great flavor. The eel had a sweet sauce that was also excellent. 

Service was a little laid back, but all in a good experience."}
{"text":"Decided to order delivery from here not too long ago because, hey, sushi brought straight to your door sounds like a good idea. Terrible mistake. The food took about an hour and a half to arrive. By the time it got here, it was ice-cold, making even more apparent the fact that this food tastes just like those day-old Chinese leftovers you have in your fridge.

Now, I didn't say week-old leftovers. The food wasn't quite rancid. But my Philadelphia rolls, maki rolls, and calamari all tasted like nothing and cost me a fortune. It's kind of like that flavor you get while chewing gum that you've already sucked all the sugar out of. How they managed to turn something as simple and flavorful as a Philadelphia roll into a chewy ball of rice just blows my mind.

The only thing I can say in their defense is that they did make some excellent udon noodles (that is, after I thoroughly nuked them). But at $12 a pint, I would sure as hell be much better off getting those noodles from any cheap Chinese or Thai takeout joint."}
{"text":"This was our second trip to Edo. The first time we went, we waited for over five minutes for someone to acknowledge us before we finally gave up and left. This time we were able to get the attention of the hostess/waitress and she led us to a table. She brought us water and menus. She seemed like she had a cold, so we're both hoping we didn't pick anything up.

We ordered sake, broccoli with garlic, the sashimi deluxe, salmon skin roll, oyster tempura roll and scallop nigiri. The broccoli w/garlic was served with a sweet garlicky sauce. It was a pretty dish. The sauce was a little too sweet for me, but still a good dish. Although I ordered the Sashimi Deluxe, she brought me the Sushi Deluxe. I should have realized she had misheard me since she asked if Spicy Tuna was OK. I didn't realize till later that was one of the rolls offered with the Sushi Deluxe. I found the spicy tuna more salty than spicy and was not a fan. The sushi itself was quite good. The rolls however, were just OK, nothing special. The highlight was definitely the scallop nigiri.

The waitress disappeared for long periods of time. While we were waiting to get our bill, we noticed someone else who came in and stood by the cashier's desk for about 5 minutes before he eventually left. It reminded us of our first time there when no-one ever noticed us. Only two other tables in the restaurant had guests, but we could see that they did get a call or two, so maybe they have a bigger delivery business. Eventually our waitress brought the bill. However, it didn't appear she was going to come back to pick it up anytime soon. After a while I just took it up to the cashier's desk where she told me they were very busy.

The food was OK. The service could definitely be improved. We won't rush back as there are better sushi options in Madison."}
{"text":"authentic japanese cuisine, good service, great miso soup, lovely tempura and some good sushi too. I like this place."}
{"text":"I ate here not too long ago and would always come here whenever I was craving sushi. I came with a group of 6 people and we all ordered sushi. The rolls I got vs my friends rolls were so disappointing! They were practically invisible. The take out sushi from Copps looked better than the rolls I received. Needless to say, this experience has pretty much left me not wanting to come back here."}
{"text":"New ownership, sign states they won't honor gift certificates issued by prior owner. (Am writing this review on iPhone.) Great location. You can tell authenticity with the details, e.g., beautiful sushi platter presentation, printed thick paper napkin, personalized printed chopstick wrap. Had the salmon lover sushi platter, got 8 pieces for about $15, served with miso and salad. For this price, I expected 12 pieces. But I guess the close proximity to the University and Capitol justifies the what seems to be downtown Chicago price points. Both salmon and sushi were freshly made. Salmon was tender, not  chewy. Except for price points, I would have given 5 stars. Would definitely come back and recommend."}
{"text":"They delivered late which was great as an alternative to Sushi Express but the texture of their sushi was a little off. To mushy to be able to taste the different parts of the roll. Not bad for delivery at 11pm but certainly not as good as my go to, sushi express."}
{"text":"Below average Japanese at a reasonable price with average service and ambiance...

Possibly spoiled by Izumi's in Milwaukee and other fine Japanese restaurants, I was rather disappointed in my sushi experience. The variety of sushi offered was average and fresh, but did not have the character or richness of the good sushi enjoyed elsewhere. The tempura tried was seemingly triple-battered, which made a lightly fried treat seem heavy and less savory. Other dishes including their miso soup and fried rice were merely adequate with no stand outs.

The location is convenient; nestled in the 500 Park St. block -- it is a bit of an eyesore, but inside, it is larger than expect, yet  had a cozy feel at the same time.  The service was quick in spots and negligent about drinks and check distribution at other times (business was moderate). The best feature Edo provides is price. It is amongst the least expensive Japanese restaurants that I have ever patronized.

If you live in Madison and want fresh (but modestly appealing) Japanese food at a value price, Edo's is for you."}
{"text":"We stopped in impulsively and the three of us ordered \"the Love Boat.\" The service was prompt and friendly and had a feeling of personal \"family-owned business\" care. 
Then we ate...and Oh.My.God. I travel a lot, and usually expect the best sushi on the coasts or in Vegas. This did NOT taste like Madison sushi. It was some of the best cuts of sashimi I've ever had (as I write this review my mouth is watering from the memory of the tuna). The dragon roll with it was great.
There's a happy hour on weekends and I definitely intend to go back, often."}
{"text":"I took my Japanese Mother thinking it would be a treat for her not to cook. Wrong!! You can tell what the quality of the restaraunt by their miso soup. It was clearly instant soup. And it was just warm. Japanese people have to have thier food hot. We were hungry so we ate the food we ordered but we were very disappointed with the taste. My Mother could make much better Sushi.The green tea also tasted old. Maybe the tea came from their namesake, \"Edo\" era. Yes,I give credit for their atmosphere but that is it. Ask youself, is Japanese food really about the \"quantity\" OR \"Quality \"? If it's quantity,then go to a Chinese restraurant."}
{"text":"Should I start with the hair in my salad or the lack of knowledge from the staff, or the horrible food?

The hair in my salad is self explanitory.  I ordered a pork katsu (a.k.a. tonkatsu in Japanese).  The staff didn't know what tonkatsu was.  Go figure, none of them are Japanese. 

When I did get my order of pork katsu, it came with Thai Sweet Chili Sauce instead of traditional tonkatsu sauce.  When I asked the staff for the \"tonkatsu\" sauce she was dumbfounded.  She said that's the sauce.  When I confronted her and told her this isn't the sauce and that it's \"thai sweet chili sauce\" she just acted her dumb self.  She offered to bring me out Tempura sauce, that was a failure.  Then I advised her that it's a BROWN SAUCE, and she chuckled and brought me out some watered down soy sauce.  Epic Fail.  The pork katsu was paper thin too.  It was like eating potato chips.

The dragon roll and california roll were a tad below average.  

The miso soup was borderline gross, it tasted like salted water and some seaweed.  

The salad with the hair in it was replaced.  After eating it I should have just let them have it because the dressing was almost as bad as having a hair in the salad.

I recommend AVOIDING THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant out for the first time a couple of weeks ago. The food is delicious! The tempura is light and flavorful. The sushi is very good. I love the snow white rolls! My husband and I enjoyed our dinner in the restaurant. Only strange thing, was how incredibly quiet it was. There was no background music, so it felt like you could eavesdrop on everyone's conversations. Not bad if your having a boring date, but felt a little awkward. Perhaps some quiet music in the background? This is the only reason for four stars and not five. We've also done take out a couple of times. The last time our order was half wrong. We enjoyed it but it was not what we ordered."}
{"text":"Ordered from here- they messed up 3 of the rolls and forgot two. Furthermore, the sushi itself was slacking. Would not suggest."}
{"text":"For a place that is hidden among the wasteland of South Park Street, this is truly a jewel in the rough when it comes to rolls.  The variety, flavor, and innovation of their rolls far surpasses Takara and is a better value than Muramoto when you don't want to spend too much on dinner but still be satisfied.  If you want to make sushi a standard part of your diet, Edo can give you the value and taste to make that happen.  The rest of the menu is pretty standard (tempura, teriyaki, noodles), but allows you to bring even non-sushi lovers and kids along for a pleasant dinner.  The atmosphere and service is much quieter and attentive than chaotic Takara on State Street as well.  Additional plus: what can be better than delievery sushi?!  

This may not be as good as sushi in Japan, but when you're landlocked in Wisconsin, this is a great compromise."}
{"text":"This place used to be one of my favorite places to dine and to make a delivery order for sushis. However, one day, I found out a black wire while I was chewing sushi from my delivery order. (I have no idea how the black wire can get into the sushi) 

Well, I thought that it could happen, and I sent an e-mail to the restaurant to let them know about this incident since it was my favorite place. But, I never heard anything from the restaurant yet.. (It has been about a year now)

I want to give a try again someday, but still not ready yet.."}
{"text":"I get Edo's food regularly simply because they deliver.  The sushi is OK, and the fried rice is OK.  If you're dining out, there are better options for both."}
{"text":"Edo is now my go-to sushi spot for delivery in Madison, after moving here from Boston eight months ago. My favorites are their vegetable rainbow roll, spicy salmon roll, shrimp tempura roll (with spicy sauce added as a special request) and the inari (tofu) nigiri. Their spicy salmon roll is the bomb - the salmon is chopped up and mixed with the spicy sauce, which is exactly how my favorite sushi spot in Boston prepared it. (I tend not to get the fancy rolls, preferring to order more simple rolls instead. All of this sushi plus two appetizers set us back $40 with tip and delivery - not bad.) We also enjoyed their vegetable tempura and pan-fried gyoza. I'm looking forward to trying their lunch special soon, which looks like a great deal. We've ordered delivery through EatStreet, and it has always been on time. No problems with our orders either."}
{"text":"I don't like Edo as much as I like Takara, but it's a good alternative.  I've been there two or three times, and each time has been equally pleasant.  The decor is stunningly beautiful, and the waitstaff is attentive and friendly.  The sushi is very good, but I just like Takara's more."}
{"text":"I can't testify as to anything except their sushi, but I was always impressed with it.  Great atmosphere considering it is located on Park.  They also deliver, which is a bonus.  The prices are extremely reasonable for the amount of food you get and the service is always top notch.  Edo is a great environment for the sushi novice.
It just frustrates me that others devalue Edo because it isn't a high end Japanese joint with sleek, modern design and innovative food. That isn't the point. Just enjoy it for what it is."}
{"text":"The first two times I ate here I thought tasty sushi and nothing special about the service, but a neat atmosphere.

However I went here for lunch this afternoon and it was great.  I got good miso soup a nice little salad, a spicy tuna roll, tuna roll, and philadelphia roll in addition to some crab meat and tempura flakes with spicy sauce that the sushi chef gave me on the house and all of it was great.  The cost of this massive feast was only $14.50 quite a deal, and the service was better with everyone being friendly and polite.  

Edo is definately worth checking out if you have not eaten here before and I have a feeling I'll go back again real soon."}
{"text":"Overrated for Sushi. Its not very well prepared, a little sloppy even. I have however only ever eaten sushi here."}
{"text":"Great food terrible pop music playing while eating. Everyone complain for me. They should be playing some crazy Japanese Kyoto music!"}
{"text":"Ok, sushi-wise I'd probably call it a 2.5... maybe a three BUT they DELIVER!  That being said, I've never set foot in the place, but I've had it a couple of times :)

They are fairly hard to understand on the phone and they've gotten lost nearly every time (I do live in a hard to find place, but I warn against that when I order) and the sushi is meh, but seriously THEY DELIVER.  I really don't mind the price to be able to enjoy a little bit of sushi while my daughter sleeps!  

Nothing really imaginative on the menu... I'd suggest the Black Pearl Roll, and any of the Spicy Crunchy ones and the Caterpillar Roll.  The Crazy Dragon Roll sounds great, but doesn't travel well :(  If I ever make it in to the actual restaurant it will be the first one I try!"}
{"text":"Worst meal ever. Since they refuse to admit they put pork in my rice I'm pulling it out of the garbage can and driving it over. The food was wrong,cold, and generally crap. Everybody makes mistakes but not these clowns. If you are a vegetarian looking for a different option then give them a try. Don't be fooled by the little pieces of stuff that looks like dead pig,smells like dead pig and gross,tastes like......dead pig. They swear it not."}
{"text":"Overall rolls were well made. The crunchy stuff was a little stale. Favorite roll was the spicy yellowtail. Kani salad was also delicious."}
{"text":"Service out weighs food. Food is decent, but I'd rather give my business to a place with better service."}
{"text":"Ordered maki combo (3 basic rolls) and the Dynamite roll (cooked fish roll). Sushi is slightly improved over grocery store sushi.  The side salad is pretty skimpy--iceberg lettuce with a teeny bit of carrot, and ginger salad dressing (which I normally like but this was too creamy). 

Not much to say. Can't recommend over better options."}
{"text":"Ordered from this restaurant on Seamless. The driver called when he got to my building and said I needed to come down. I told him that is why I ordered delivery, for it to be delivered. He finally came up. An hour later the driver called me and screamed at me that he came up and he got in trouble from his boss after I called to complain. He yelled and screamed at me and I was appalled. He was rude and abusive. Do not ever order or go to this restaurant. They are rude and the driver verbally assaulted me. Horrible management and horrible staff!!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Edo last night with two friends. I believe we choose to go there because one of the girls I was with loves hibachi and the prices are cheaper than Ginza. In this case, lower prices means lower quality.

Jenn and I split a spicy tuna roll and both ordered udon noodles. Bailey ordered shrimp hibachi. The salad was typical of a Japanese restaurant, but Bailey and Jenn said the clear soup lacked flavor. Our sushi was also bland. Bailey's hibachi I guess had more of a \"teriyaki\" flavor which was not what she wanted. Because I'm not as experienced with udon, I thought it was ok, but Jenn said she has definitely had better. 

All in all, it was a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"The food is okay but the delivery guy was very rude. I have never had a delivery person complain/ask for a larger tip. It was pathetic. Plus, when I called to confirm my order, the lady I spoke to kept rushing me off the phone.The sushi is not worth the poor service. There are a lot better options out there."}
{"text":"If you need your sushi restaurants to be hip and swanky, don't go to Edo..But if you just want delicious sushi, I highly recommend it. There aren't bells and whistles, it's just straight up great food. I have ordered sushi for carry-out, delivery, and have dined in (all 3 multiple times), and have never been disappointed. I'm a little surprised by all the negative reviews, I've never had anything other than great food at Edo. The price is comparable to other sushi restaurants in town, but I feel like the portions are bigger at Edo, and they have a lot of fun, imaginative sushi."}
{"text":"Ordered online. Called when they were 10 minutes late for delivery (Time provided by them from the email confirmation) She said just a few more minutes. I called 20 minutes later and they said just 5 more minutes. I said 30 minutes late is unacceptable when you only get 30 minutes for lunch. She said they will take $5 off. I said doesn't help that my lunch is over. She said it just takes longer. My response was then call to let customer know you are running late. She hung up on me. Never ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"I've never been inside the restaurant, I've only had it delivered to my house a few times, but I like it. The shrimp tempura is delicious, and their seaweed salad has nice big chunks of cucumber, which is great. However, it seems a little on the pricey side for what it is. But if you want to eat sushi under the covers in front of the tv, this is a great option."}
{"text":"Worst. Service. Ever. Waiter came and quickly put down water glasses and never said hello or anything. When I remarked to my husband that I wanted to order a drink he said he that was just the busboy bringing water and not the waiter. Weren't we surprised when the same guy came back 10 minutes later because he was the waiter. There were only 2 other tables with people seated at them so it's not like he was busy. When my husband asked if we could order waiter retorted \"that's why I'm here\".  So nice.  We did order beers and sushi right then and he was sitting over at the sushi bar and forgot to bring us the beer until we called him over another 10 minutes later and asked.  (He said \"oh, I forgot.\"  Like I said there was almost nobody else in the place.). Never brought our soups or salads that came with the sushi dinners and another waitress asked if we wanted them.  Sushi was super bland, in my opinion, almost no variety in the sushi dinner for 2...just repeats of the same fish which is very atypical of a sushi dinner...usually lots of variety.  Pieces of fish were small and thin and rice was among the worst I've had. Even the California roll was not good and that's hard to ruin.  The salad with the ginger dressing was more like really watery thousand island...Blech.  Waiter was MIA for most of the meal and we had to flag someone down to get him if we wanted anything. Don't know who owns this place but I suggest getting rid of this guy and getting someone who actually wants a job. And also, new sushi chefs that know how to cook rice and slice fish would help. Never again."}
{"text":"This place gets 1 star for getting our order right and delivering on time. But the food was terrible. Spent $60 on cold dumplings, iceberg salad, luke warm miso soup, and worst of all, mushy sushi that was definitely NOT fresh. So much for treating ourselves - I feel sick - both from the food and about the money spent."}
{"text":"been here two times and I went there everytime I miss sushi. the sushi is pretty good and the price is not that expensive. although be careful if you order from cooked sushi, because it is like fried regular sushi (although it tastes okay if you like fried food). but I enjoy the sushi most. my friend who came with me enjoy her salad and hibachi as well. pretty good if you crave some sushi in Madison."}
{"text":"It was OK... Little expensive for this quality delivery, I had fried rice and firehouse roll"}
{"text":"I love this place! Their lunch specials are really good. They have a lot of sushi to choose from and you get two rolls for $9.95 and it comes with salad and soup. I recommend this place to everyone. I've never been here at night so idk how the service is when it's busier but lunch time is great. The whole meal takes 25-30 minutes."}
{"text":"Edo has often fabulous sushi and intensely attentive service. Case in point, after my boyfriend paid for our meal with his debit card, he left it on the table.  Our waiter chased us down the street to give him his card back.  The sushi is lovely, well crafted, and fresh.  
Don't be fooled by the Park Street location--  the atmosphere, food, and service are almost always excellent.  However the two times we ordered delivery I have been less than pleased with the presentation and quality of the rolls.  The Bento Box lunch specials are a steal.  Oftentimes, it is not very crowded, so it is a great place to have an intimate meal."}
{"text":"I really can't, in good faith, give this place a good review. I've experienced Edo twice now, once for a pick-up lunch special and the other for delivery. The pick-up lunch was okay. I did one of the 2 roll combos and it came with a cup of miso and a small salad. A-Okay.

The delivery order was simply awful. It was super slow to arrive (90 minutes) and nothing was at the correct temperature. The tempura was soggy and not well prepared. The sashimi was warm and incredibly unappetizing. I had one piece and could instantly tell that this fish was previously frozen - and questionably thawed (had a bizarre texture.) I honestly could not see going back for delivery and even going back for take-out is questionable at this time. There are simply too many better options in the Madison area for this to happen. 

Ultimately, your time and money are best spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"I first visited Edo Japanese Restaurant as part of a class project. I was acting as a promotions team member for Savor South Madison, a website that aims to inform UW students and the greater Madison community about the amazing restaurants in South Madison.
I've only recently became a sushi fan, and Edo has played a big part in encouraging me to try different types Their menu is pretty extensive and offers a lot of sushi as well as traditional Japanese meals. The presentation of the food is one of the best parts of eating at Edo. Sometimes the sushi looks so pretty you don't want to eat it!
I have brought a lot of my friends to Edo and they absolutely love it. Not a lot of students on the UW-Madison campus take the time to venture to South Madison, but Edo is a perfect showcase of how much the community has to offer as far as food and dining. 
If you have not been to Edo Japanese Restaurant, I encourage you to try it out! And when you're done, head farther down Park Street and see what other gems you can find."}
{"text":"Ordered food for delivery, it was quite nice. I thought it took a while to arrive, I am not criticizing for that. The food was very delicious, squid absolutely marvelous, almost amazing considering that Madison is nowhere near the ocean. So it was quite nice with standard ginger dressing.  I will most definitely be ordering delivery food from them again when I'm in the mood for nice Japanese goodies.  I had squid tempura, green salad, sweet potatoes tempura, rice, and sauces plus miso soup.  It went marvelously with a dry white Bordeaux wine I was drinking."}
{"text":"It was a lazy night, so I decided to order delivery sushi from Edo. I know I shouldn't have the highest standards for delivery sushi, but I was disappointed nonetheless. Their raw fish just did not taste good. And they left out the green onion in a roll that has two ingredients... one of them being green onion. The crunchy spicy tuna roll was all right, it at least had the spicy tuna flavor. But the caterpillar roll tasted like nothing but tempura batter to me. The bottom line is that the food does not taste good."}
{"text":"Great food, great desserts, & a variety of explosive flavors that blend well with their amazing sushi.  Lady Gaga & Bullets are my go to at all times.  I highly recommend their ice cream.  Staff is very friendly and help explain menu."}
{"text":"I was going to give this place three stars, but after realizing that I spent $60 on this bullshit they are lucky to be getting two stars. I got delivery and the nigiri had too much mushy rice, the ice cream tasted like soap, and I know for a fact that I am not ordering delivery from them ever again. Sad. :("}
{"text":"I eat at the Park St. or Monona Edo location more than I end up checking in as this is the best sushi that I've had around town.  They have a wonderful number of styles of roles, apps, and other meals for those who aren't into the sushi aspect of a Japanese restaurant.  
I have dined in and carried out and each time I have received wonderful service.  They are great with larger and smaller groups and patient with kids and any special changes related to different tastes. I really enjoy the fact that they restaurant remains consistent in regards to flavor and quality as it is what keeps me coming back.  Be ready to pay for a good meal though as even if you share with someone or a group, the meal is going to be a bit pricy but well worth the bottom line."}
{"text":"We eat at Edo's about one time per month.  Their Sushi roles and fried rice are good.  We almost always take out and eat at home. If I was rating on eating at the physical location, I would probably give a 3-star review, but they are great for takeout."}
{"text":"We ordered Edo earlier this week and I had meant to write about that when I did -- ultimately they have some things they do very well, but some of it that they don't. For my wife and I, however, we often get the sushi craving and we also get lazy at times and don't want to go out and they're the only sushi restaurant in delivery range so we've just learned to be picky about what we get from them.

Their delivery times are standard, 30-45 minutes typically, but my wife almost always orders gyoza from them and it is almost universally luke warm (or even cold) by the time it gets there. I'm not crazy about this but my wife is crazy about gyoza and so there we have it. Even luke warm it's decent so I imagine if we actually got it fresh it'd be great...

There have only been a couple of times we've gone off the sushi menu for delivery and it reinforced our desire to stick with the sushi menu. Both their Katsu Don and Yaki Soba weren't appreciated by my wife. My wife lived in Japan for a couple of years and so she's got some high standards, so take that for what it is. I thought they were not bad.

Their sushi is generally excellent, however, and I try to get one I really like and one new one every time -- but here's what I recall about the various ones I've had:
California Roll - One of the better ones I've had. 

Eel Roll - I like eel and they do alright with it but I think pairing it with something other than cucumber would improve it.

Crab Tempura Roll - Eh, it was okay, and for the price I'd say skip it. I am reasonably sure it was surimi (imitation crab) but if it wasn't ... it tasted like it.

Tuna Roll - A little on the cookie cutter side but heck if I don't like raw tuna. Before I was a little more health conscious I definitely preferred the spicy version. 

Salmon Roll - Same as above, though I prefer the tuna.

Cucumber Roll - My wife loves these. It's pretty much impossible to do these wrong and Edo does just fine here.

Oshinko Roll (pickled radish) - I thought I wouldn't like them as I'm not a \"pickled *\" fan... but the combination of the rice, seaweed, and the radish was great. I'd get these again in a heartbeat. I also found that they were even better without soy.

Sweet Potato Roll - My favorite \"dessert sushi\". They have a sweet soy that they use with these and it's amazing. 

So in short -- of I were to go out -- I'd probably take the time to go to Wasabi -- but if you want sushi brought to your door they are a good choice. Edo does some things really well. Find what works for you, stick with it."}
{"text":"I love this place, I have been here too many times to remember. The sushi is fantastic and a good price as far as sushi goes. I have been to most of the other places in town, including Takara, Sushi Miramoto and Restaurant Miramoto, and this place is the best value for the money.  They have creative stuff too, one time I got a special appetizer that was pringles with spicy crunchy tuna and avocado on top! The atmosphere is quiet, which I like because I am hard of hearing, but if you are looking for a hopping place don't come here. One thing, the service is questionable. They are prompt but there is some strange vibe sometimes, like I am being judged for being a loud hungry American. But, I don't mind because it is that good. Godzilla roll is bomb."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in Madison. I have tried Sushi Express, Koi Sushi, Wasabi, and Red Sushi and Edo is still by far my favorite because of both price and quality. I've ordered delivery and dined in, but mostly delivery because their delivery is always on time (if not even faster). I always order raw fish sushi because they are my favorite, and the fish here is always fresh. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because their rice (for sushi) could be softer, but it still tastes great. This review only applies to raw fish sushi because that's all I've ever ordered."}
{"text":"My review is between an A-OK and Meh. I order all vegetarian sushi and it was just so damn bland. I think it's true that avocados are better in California because these had nothin' going for them.

The seaweed salad was good, but I've experienced better.

Delivery was fast. I also appreciated that the packaging was small and not wasteful."}
{"text":"I am confused when I don't see Edo listed with Takara and Wasabi among Madison's best sushi restaurants.  Portions are larger than Takara's and are fresher than Wasabi's.  

Edo serves great maki.  Best are the sweet potato tempura and salmon tempura maki.  The spicy tuna and salmon rolls are good, too.
To boot, the service and atmosphere is authentic, quick, and friendly.

The only drawback is that their specials sometimes aren't as fresh as they could be.  But that's probably why they are the special.

I have yet to try the sushi or sashimi yet."}
{"text":"I usually don't do this, but today, in more than 1 piece of sushi, I found pieces of hard plastic. And then they didn't even give it to me for free after I only ate 3 out of the 10 pieces - they just gave me a 3 dollar discount. Not sanitary and not okay by any means. Truly disgusted. Never coming back."}
{"text":"I love this place! They always have great, fresh sushi and wonderful specials.
It's close to everything downtown and they even deliver. 

I love the kiss roll and the Kani salad. And the super Edo roll is also fantastic.
It's a nice quiet place that you can meet up with friends and eat sushi and have a glass of plum wine."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped at Edo a couple weeks ago on our way to a UW hockey game. I wish I'd Yelped them first.

Service was acceptable. The restaurant was clean. They got us out the door in time for the puck drop.

The food: not so great. I ordered a nabayaki soba soup. The noodles were overcooked, the broth and chicken were both bland, the tempura was greasy, and there wasn't much in the way of toppings. My wife's katsudon wasn't any better - mushy breading and overly sweet sauce. She left half of it on the plate.

The prices: average for a Japanese restaurant, too high for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"When entering in Edo from the main entrance, there's a little lobby area that you have to bypass before being seated in the restaurant. We got seated near the windows and there were lovely rose on the table (I imagine since it week of Valentine's Day). 

We ordered a tempura combination as an appetizer which has tempura sweet potato, taro, broccoli, shrimp and squid. I would've preferred if there was at least two of each tempura piece but three was only one shrimp, taro and broccoli so we had to split those in half to share. 

For our entree, we got three rolls of sushi to share: New York City roll, Sunset roll and Dragon Fly roll. Each were all equally delicious, however if I had to pick a favorite, I would say the Dragon Fly roll takes the crown! I was definitely quite full afterwards.

Although the service can be a bit slow, it look a while before our order was taken and it took a while for the check to arrive. Additionally, the green tea we ordered was lukewarm and didn't taste hot enough for my liking. I would just avoid ordering tea next time and opt for just the water instead."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. I got in on a late flight and was not expecting to be able to order a sushi delivery to the hotel at this time of night. The sushi arrived in good time and was beautifully presented and quite fresh.

I should add I am not a fan of \"everything and the kitchen sink\" rolls, where it is plain impossible to tell how good the fish is. I like the taste of raw fish.  I like generous pieces of beautifully cut, unadorned, super fresh sashimi. In this regard, Edo delivered admirably. It was a Wednesday night what's more, which is typically not a good Sushi night for me. Small sushi restaurants don't always get daily fish deliveries, so the day of the week can influence freshness."}
{"text":"Joined my friend and her husband here for dinner. It took 20 min for them to bring our drinks and we found hair in the food."}
{"text":"Have never been disappointed with the place.  I have tried both delivery sushi and sitting down and dining with them for sushi and both were great experiences.  Also tried the Japanese soda during one of my lunch visits, it's delicious, refreshing, and fun! Enjoy"}
{"text":"I've been here a lot, before the new management/owners and after, and I like it!  It seems to have improved lately, though. I almost always order sushi, so I can't really comment on the hot food, with the exception of the fried rice, which I ordered last time. 
   I ordered chicken fried rice, and it was some of the best I've ever had. Not the least bit greasy, full of fresh vegetables, sliced thinly--it was fantastic.   It came with miso soup--while I've had better miso soup, it wasn't horrible. I also ordered the Caterpillar roll and the Iron Man roll, and both were great. The Caterpillar has shrimp tempura with tuna and avocado, and the Iron Man had lobster, shrimp, avocado, and some other stuff--it was a special on the board that night.  I've also had their spicy tuna and salmon rolls, the California roll, the Godzilla roll and a few others--I've not been disappointed so far. Some I like more than others, but it has to dowith personal preferences, not the quality of the food.
    I have also always had fast, friendly service--I never get delivery, always take-out. I will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful find. Went there the very night I moved into a house around the corner. And then continued to go almost weekly. I adore their sushi. Coming from a native San Franciscan this means I lot. I was hestitant to eat raw fish at all while I lived in Wisconsin. Edo changed my mind. The prices are reasonable. The portions are impressive. Don't forget to notice the cabinatery. I've been told the owner made them. And I swear to god, their water tastes SO good. I have no idea why."}
{"text":"I ordered the sashimi and it was the worst sushi I have ever had. The fish did not taste fresh and was served in a bowl which I found rather strange. Over all terrible. I will not be getting sushi here again."}
{"text":"As far as seafood in the Midwest goes, it's tough to beat Edo.  

Great food.  Reasonable prices.  Pleasant atmosphere.  

Some might argue that Wasabi serves better sushi better for an overall dinner experience, Edo can't be beat."}
{"text":"The food looked and smelled amazing. I'm sure it probably tasted good too, but we'll never know since the place only offers slippery, plastic chop sticks. RIP white table cloth. 

5 stars for our noses."}
{"text":"Hey!  I got a million sushis on the lunch special menu!  It is really hard for me to find a bad sushi because I eat only veggie Sushis [so I apologize if you were looking for a review on tuna or salmon] but everything they did was actually high class as heeeeeeell, and so i assume their fish sushi is the same.  Their soup was delicious nad their seaweed salad was amazing!!!"}
