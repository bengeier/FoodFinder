{"text":"I would like to tell you how I liked the food here, but sadly cannot.  I went in for lunch today craving some jerk pork. When I got here I had to wait for several minutes for someone to come out of the back to take my order. When she did finally drag herself out of the back, since it's so much work to look after a customer and all, she informed me that they do not have jerk pork and pointed to the menu board. Rather than give me suggestions on what else I might enjoy, she proceeded to take a personal call on her cell. She was on the call for a while laughing and sucking her teeth. Since she had no interest in what I might want to order instead, I left."}
{"text":"The customer service was very poor and so was the food. I ordered Curry Chicken and it was extremely dry as if it was prepared 2 days ago. The freshest thing was the veggies. I will never buy their food again!!!"}
{"text":"Mmmm!!  Jerk Chicken!  Service isn't great but it's all about the Jerk at Willy's.  The chicken is really really good.  I keep wanting to try something else on the menu but I can't not order the jerk chicken.  The order is a decent size for the price and the rice is very well spiced as well.  Some other places (like Jerk Kin)g might offer you more meat but the sauce is just on the skin.  Not nearly as good as Willy's Jerk."}
