{"text":"My husband and I stumbled into this hidden gem recently and were amazed at the quality of the food... This is a place located inside the Christown Mall... There is a big selection on \"botanas\" snacks such as corn, spiced fruit, rasados, tacos and seafood and Agua frescas. Typically  a bit hesitant to try seafood at mom and pop shops, but this place has nice cleanliness feel to it and you can taste it in the quality of their food. They also have Mexican candy galore!"}
{"text":"I have had ceviche from here with no problems ordering or even adding drinks or more food at times . But today was a little frustrating being that I was in the mood for something different I was at the register ordering but less than a second later changed my mind but boom she was grabbing for change. I tried to relay to the person working i wanted to make a quick switch but she said she really could not speak English. I've seen this place cater to all types.& if the plan to continue to there sound be bilingual people of shift to help those that can not speak Spanish!

 I'm usually helped by a young man that speaks great English and is super helpful with choices"}
{"text":"Had the carne and shrimp tacos, absolutely fantastic!! Get them with the red salsa to add a little kick! 

Stop by if you are in the area you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Brought my wife and kids here and it was worth the short wait in line. Kids had a carne asada and a bean burrito. My wife had a shrimp coctail and I had a large campechana cocktail. The cocktails are NOT the typical American cocktails you might be accustomed to... They are Mexican cocteles that are flavored with lime, Clamato, vegetables and chile. Very flavor rich!!! We also shared a shrimp ceviche in a bag of Salsa Verde Tostitos! This is their specialty and it is absolutely delicious! Too bad this place is hidden in a mall...so good it should be in its own corner closer to my home! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"When you guys close the restaurant you should notify people when you got me looking all over the damn place losers"}
{"text":"Great quality food!  The shrimp tacos are amazing!  Delicious salsa & the best ceviche in town.  Kind of hidden in Cristown mall but if you're in the area I highly recommend stopping by for a quick delicious bite!"}
