{"text":"Awesome fried chicken and spicy sauce! Great service good beer love you long time review"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The sweet and spicy chicken is so, so good with just the perfect amount of spice. The fried rice is great too! Big portions for reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Came here after a tournament with hungry kids.  We were told the fried chicken may take as long as 30 minutes to reach the table. They were short of help. Luckily my hubby ordered the Dungeness crab as an appetizer.   It was okay.  But the chicken was delicious!!!  We ordered the Padak and 1/2 Honey Butter with Egg Fried Rice.  I smothered my Padak chicken with that side Wasabi sauce and it was certainly a mix of sweet, sour, spicy and BOOM!!!  Pop of umami flavor!  The pickled radish was just a nice touch to everything.  My kids loved the Honey Butter chicken, I kept hearing my younger one hum....\"Mmmm!\"   We will definitely return.  Hopefully they will have enough help next on my next visit.  The servers were really nice though and apologetic."}
{"text":"Service is not very good, and the food takes a while to come out. I'm usually patient but waiting an hour is a little too far for food."}
{"text":"What can I say! Wait I can't. This place is amazing. Food is beyond any flavors I could of imagined. Good food and well priced. This place is well doable for a large family or group of friends, even kids will enjoy this. Make sure to order the fried rice. Huge portions too. I'm still on awwwww that I can't find anything to complain about hahaha..... They are on point at this place."}
{"text":"I really ike this place.  Pa-dak was great and soy source dak was amazing.  I also tried Yang-nyeong-dak and it was very srpcy.  Egg fried rice was worth to try. Very very big portion but you still can finish.  Marinated white raddish was also good and all the fries were very fresh.  All was worth for my money.  Servers were very nice.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"KFC stands for Korean Fried Chicken. Excellent fried chicken and beer comparable to Korean chicken restaurants in California. I eat here quite frequently and quality and service are pretty consistent. Price is very fair.  Recently fed my family of 6 for $50 with tip. You gotta get the half or whole fried chicken with whatever sauce on the side (they're all good). This keeps it crispy."}
{"text":"Winner winner chicken dinner!! Omg anyone who is a foodie needs to try crazy chicken in Chandler! They have a menu up on their fb page/Yelp with various food selections for those who are interested. If you want to have an Asian beer or soju they offer that too. Spacious and inviting atmosphere. Welcoming and friendly staff. The manager was super accommodating. The chicken wings OMG I was in heaven. They go by orders for a 1/2 chicken or a whole chicken (feeds 3-4 people). I would recommend the garlic soy and sweet Korean chili wings (not spicy at all). The manager was so sweet and accommodating! Please give them a try and spread the word!"}
{"text":"We were not impressed with the chicken.  Pieces of chicken tossed in barbecue sauce.  Service was ok but trouble with communication  The restaurant has picnic tables.  Presentation of food is not impressively.  Prices are too high for the quality of food served.  No need to go back"}
{"text":"So there we were - literally the only customer's in this cavernous restaurant that formerly housed the Chino Bandido in Chandler, at like 4:45 on a Tuesday.    \"This can't be promising\" I thought.  Then the server came and cheerfully gave us menus that basically only have options for a $9-10 half chicken or a $16-18 whole chicken (depending on the style) plus sides.  Ok, not super expensive but not super cheap either, and not really a great option available for just one person.  Luckily we were two people.  Whole Padak Chicken with the hot, mild and padak sauces all on the side, plus egg fried rice is what we ordered.  Result?  THIS CHICKEN WAS AMAZING.  Perfectly crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, the sauces were all fantastic.  The hot mixed with the mild created this really unique flavor that I couldn't get enough of, and the sort of soy/garlic/green onion/horseradish or mustard flavor of the padak sauce was incredible.   The egg fried rice threw me off at first, I expected it to be Panda Express style dry fried rice but this was eggy and buttery and after a while I couldn't get enough.  I'm going back, I'm bringing my coworkers, I'm going to skydive into this building, I'll fly on the wings of a falcon if I have to, but I'm getting my fix of dope Korean chicken again."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  Took over 15 minutes to get a water and soda.  Waitress entered wrong order then forgot the rice.  Asked 3 times to get 2 orders or rice and she came back with 1.  10 minutes later got the other.  Multiple people complaining about service and incorrect bills.  Food was descent, but service sucks.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"We just stopped by there for lunch based on these reviews.  There were two other tables there at 12:20pm and basically the place looks like it's closing.  The service wasn't very good from the start.  VERY limited menu and they were out of the spicy chicken.  He said it was being taken off the menu.  A heads-up on that would have been nice.  So I ordered the half fried chicken (no clue what makes this dish Korean ... just basic fried chicken).    My friends order came out about five minutes before mine with no salad ... like it mentions on the menu.  When my order finally came out I asked about the missing salads.  He said they were out of them and just stood there and looked at me.  I asked for something in return ... side dish ... anything.  He comes back with two salads.  I'm at a loss.  The icing on the cake was the bill.  The total before tax was about $21.  He hand writes \"10% off\" on the check.  Electronically it indicates there is a $1.10 discount.  That's good stuff right there.  I'm tempted to come back to see just how bad they can be on a regular basis.  NOTE: The only reason I gave them one star is because Yelp doesn't have a zero (or negative) star rating."}
{"text":"New location opened up. It was the old chino bandito location at Dobson and Chandler Blvd.  They still had some of the same decorations. Very sparse and  old furniture. The fried chicken was good but the sauce was awesome. For $9.99 for a half chicken seemed a bit high. It was more than enough to split. It does come with a bland cole slaw and some sweet relish. Not great sides but you can always order something else. Service was great. Very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"That was the most favorable chicken I've ever had. I came in on a Friday night and wasn't too crowded. First thing I noticed, were the two flaming chickens and the karaoke stage. It just gives a great atmosphere vibe because you feel like it's more than just a meal. I got seated right away. We ordered drinks and got them right away. I  mentioned that it was my first time there and didn't receive any recommendations, which I would like to receive a couple of favorite choices. We ordered the spicy padak chicken and egg fried rice. The food came in and it took a  little longer than I wanted,  but they make it fresh so thats how long it takes. No problem what so ever, it's worth the wait. This huge portion of a reddish chicken came out and each piece was cooked to perfection. The rice was not dried out and really complimented the meal. The only knock against the place was I had to walk up front to get a  refill,  but one server was covering 8 tables so I understand that it wasn't the servers fault. Overall  great experience and I will return. A great place. I  left before karaoke,  but I will go back to watch."}
{"text":"Thw sweet and spicy chicken and the garlic soy chicken were freaking amazing! Very distinct and unique amazing flavors. The fried rice is also a must have. I  suggest a trip to out to chandler if you dont live there."}
{"text":"Nuts, really didnt know what I was getting into when I saw the sandwich board pointing here. More of just a karaoke bar. No one was there, maybe we were early birds at 6p. I was expecting like a variety of chicken and sides like coleslaw, potato wedges or something.  I mean chicken and crab...the American dream! But seems this is more Korean flavors. We didnt realize. We got popcorn chicken. Good sized chunks of white meat, but as soon as we got it home (less than 5 mins away), very rubbery.  Also...SUPER expensive. Will not be returning. Sorry! But we tried!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and both times the food did not disappoint. For my most recent visit we ordered the garlic soy sauce chicken and the mild Korean sweet chili paste (gochujang) fried chicken. The garlic soy was flavorful and had the perfect amount of garlic seasoning. But the mild Korean chili paste flavor was our favorite of the night. They were sweet (but not too sweet) and savory with a true mild kick! And I love the pickled radishes that come with the chicken dishes. Please note that what we ordered were not just your regular chicken wings. They were chopped up pieces from a whole chicken. They do have the traditional American wings available on their menu but I haven't tried them. I came here for Korean fried chicken and will continue to go here whenever I have the craving for it. Last thing I wanted to mention was how excellent the service was. Our server was very attentive, happily accommodated our request for extra spicy sauce, and even gave us extra pickled radishes to go along with our leftover chicken! Thanks guy! I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Avoid this place like the plague. I would like to rate their food, but I never got any. The two guys who sat down after I put in my order did, I never even got ice water. I finally walked out to go back to work. This place will not last long, richly deserved"}
{"text":"Tried Crazy Chicken because of the great reviews and all the other chicken places in Chandler had very poor reviews.  I tried the 1/2 fried chicken and side of fries.  I was given a spicy Korean sauce to try, my wife and I really enjoyed the chicken.  Definitely the best in Chandler, definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"If you're looking for Korean style fried chicken this is your place! Unfortunately in Arizona we don't have the luxury of having places like this around so I'm super happy this place opened down the street! I got the sweet and spicy chicken and recommend that with the mu (pickled radish). They also have the cutest salt and pepper shakers."}
{"text":"Best Korean chicken, hands down! Very tasty and the chicken isn't dry. The prices are really good, too. I suggest the Garlic Soy Sauce and Korean Chili (medium heat - highest heat is pretty mean). If you're not sure what sauce you'll like, you can do the regular fried chicken and ask for sauce on the side. Definitely give these guys a try if you want to know what real chicken is."}
{"text":"Had family over and decided to grab some takeout and try out a new place at the same time. Ordered the whole Padak Chicken and the half Honey Butter Garlic Chicken. While the fry was decent the flavor was really lacking on both dishes. The Honey Butter Garlic Chicken lacked the most flavor but was juicy while the Padak Chicken had a decent flavor but was dry.  The family I had over really weren't impressed at all with the taste and the way the chicken was cut up made you really have to guess whether what you were biting into had a ton of bones or none at all.  The last nail in the coffin for me was the price which was pretty high for the amount of food you get and the flavor of the chicken dishes themselves. Overall, I sadly will not be returning based on the experience."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! If you love Korean food and spirits, this would be way worth your while."}
{"text":"Dish 1: Sweet Mild Chicken -Favorite dish. 7 out of 7 people liked this.  Dish 2: Extreme Spicy Chicken   -Spicier than what I expected but not extremely painful hot. 5 out of 7 people liked it.  Dish 3: Honey Butter Garlic Chicken  -Not my favorite but my friends loved it. 4 out of 7 people liked it.   Comparison with other restaurant: Cafe Agit Vs. Crazy Chicken  I like the Cafe Agit environment and service better. However, in my opinion, crazy chicken taste better."}
{"text":"Okay, I've only been there once. The food was expensive and only fair in quality. Sorry, Chino Bandito may have been stingy with their portions, but their food was much better. Not planning on returning to this place."}
{"text":"Super dead on a Friday night. The appetizers and fried rice for nothing to write home about. But then, the chicken came and it was absolutely delicious. It's too bad it's in an awkward location set behind Chandler Boulevard because it's really good place. The server was very friendly, And the prices were very good. For some reason we also got 10% off. I definitely plan on coming back with a large group of people so I can take advantage of the karaoke. I sure hope more people fill this place to keep it going because the fried chicken is vastly superior to other places."}
{"text":"Foods pretty yucky. Fried rice tasted like straight butter, they charge an extra $1 for honey BBQ, even though it's listed on the menu because of the honey..... The sweet and spicy chicken was boney and over sauced, the lemonade tasted like it was made w unfiltered water. Fries were pretty good tho. But that was the only reprieve.   Would never eat here again.   Service was fine."}
{"text":"Might tasty. I really enjoyed the sweet and mild chicken. Can't wait for my second visit"}
{"text":"The sweet and mild chicken was surprisingly good!  They are currently running a grand opening special of 20% off which was nice:)   One flaw is that the chicken had a lot of small bones that can be a choking hazard.  Other than that everything was good."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night around 6 pm ( no crowd) and we ate there.  We ordered the padok chicken and the butter honey chicken.  Padok was our favorite!  It was so unique to us to have Korean fried chicken! Glad we came.  We will be back.  Need to try sit garlic next time.  I hope more people try this place it's really worth it!!!"}
{"text":"I and two companions arrived promptly at six for dinner, and entered a mostly empty restaurant. We were seated immediately and ordered assorted soft drinks.  We all started off with the egg rolls ($2.99), which were provided with a dipping sauce of sweet chile, a usual Thai ingredient and not at all Korean. I must say that none of us were impressed by the egg rolls. They were properly cooked, but were lacking in flavor.  Next, companion #1 ordered the calamari ($7.99). This was a high point of the meal. Done in a fashion I had not seen before, they were long strips of thicker calamari (perhaps cut from the tubes of larger ones?), lightly breaded and lightly fried. I'm not sure just how they were cooked, but they were perhaps the most tender calamari I have ever eaten. It was served with a mayonnaise based spiced dipping sauce that was nicely complementary to it.    Companion #2 ordered the sweet and spicy chicken ($9.99) along with the egg fried rice ($3.99). She pronounce the rice to be excellent.  Companion #1 made the mistake of ordering the shrimp for $12. For the price, companion got 8 shrimp that when the head and tail were removed were no more than a U-30. Fortunately, I had ordered a bowl of egg fried rice to share with companion and that became most of companions meal.  For myself, I ordered 1/2 garlic soy sauce chicken ($9.99) and 1/2 sweet and spicy chicken ($9.99). The garlic chicken was acceptable though the only dark meat I could find was a single drum stick. The sweet and spicy chicken was so drowned in sauce as to be almost inedible.   True Korean fried chicken is an experience that you never forget. The chicken pieces are given a light coating of either cornstarch or rice starch and are then deep fried. Allowed to rest and cool, the chicken is then deep fried a second time, which removes any fat from under the skin and makes it super crispy. Unfortunately, this is not the case here.  The chicken is chopped into relatively small pieces, then battered and fried. With so much batter on it, the sauces coat the entire piece of chicken and becomes overpowering. I took a doggy bag of the sweet and spicy chicken home, and rinsed it in the sink to remove most of the sauce. Tomorrow I will briefly refry the chicken and put an acceptable Korean sauce on it.  Companion #2 ordered Mochi for dessert. Since mochi is Japanese, I was a bit surprised to find it on the menu. Based on the flavors available and based on looks and taste, I was quite sure the mochi came from Mekong Market or LeeLee's.   Inspection of the restroom was a very unpleasant affair, as the aroma made it impossible to stay in there for any amount of time.  Service was fair though a few things were not correctly served. I would have expected much better food for a bill of $54.90 plus tip.  2 stars for service and appetizers."}
{"text":"... in az is the best youre going to get. Got the ...was on point. Got the padak which was gooood. Sauce was good and the chicken crispy. The shrimp fried rice was good too. Son ate it all."}
{"text":"Walking in, we almost wanted to walk back out.  It was mostly empty, huge space with scattered tables.  Server seemed overwhelmed and maybe confused with the 3 tables, including ours.  The Padak Chicken was ok.  Something I might order again.  Overall, not impressed and probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Nestled in the spot behind the Brakes Plus where Chino Bandido used to be is Crazy Chicken and Crab, an ode to crispy fried chicken and seafood, Korean style!  I came here around opening time and got an order to go. Much of the interior seems to be similar to when it was Chino Bandido. They even have the giant stone panda! The menu is pretty simple and limited to, you guessed it, chicken and seafood : ) I decided on the spicy padak chicken ($17.99).  The order took maybe 15 minutes or so to make, and was packaged very well. The chicken came with a huge bag of sliced spring onions, spicy wasabi sauce, and 2 cartons of sweet pickled radish. The smell was heavenly as it wafted through my car driving home.   Opening up the box, it was a sizable portion of chicken, definitely enough for 2 people, maybe 3. It consisted of chopped, bone-in pieces of white and dark meat chicken (Wings, thighs, drumsticks, breast). It was perfectly crispy with an even amount of sweet/spicy sauce on it. As instructed at the restaurant, I put the sliced onion on top of the chicken and poured the spicy wasabi sauce on top which added to the taste and texture. It was a very flavorful and strong tasting dish. Overall I enjoyed it, as the chicken pieces were well cooked. The sauce did tend to be slightly too sweet for me though.  They are currently running a 10% off special for their grand opening, so come on over and try some crazy fried chicken and crab!"}
{"text":"Went to this place today at about 1pm (3/31/16). Honestly the location kinda sucks for a restaurant because it's kinda hidden in the back corner of this huge parking lot filled with car repair places. The restaurant itself was very spacious. There were about 5 tables filled with people. It was seat yourself. As soon as we walked in my boyfriend was pumped because they serve beer! We sat and ordered the garlic soy sauce chicken half order for $9.99. The portion was HUGE! So worth the price. Caution: it's very garlicky! So if you don't like garlic, order something else. Food was very good :) the waitress was very nice and attentive :) definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Fried chicken and my father's honey BBQ wings were both fantastic!. Menu is pretty limited and the location is hard to find, but it was definitely worth the visit. We will be back for sure"}
{"text":"First off, most the pictures I looked appeared to be chicken wings...drummettes and flats or some sort of that combo but when you look at the menu you can order by whole or half chicken. ??? Confused look. Ok, so we ordered anyway. Half of garlic honey chicken and half sweet spicy chicken. Food comes out and I now have a half chicken cut up in pieces deep fried and covered with their special sauce. It is a best to use a fork and knife to cut pieces of meat but beware you will never know when you will bite into a bone or if it will be white or dark meat. Now mind you, the food looks amazing but I was not at all impressed with the honey garlic chicken or the thought of biting into a bone or some other piece of inedible part of the chicken. When I'm eating I kinda like to know what pieces I should or shouldn't be eating. I don't mind working for good food but this was too much and prices were pretty expensive. Not worth it for me."}
{"text":"If you are into trying something new and tasty to the valley, and don't mind a little heat on your food, this place is for you.  I've had Korean fried chicken in several states and a couple other countries, but not here in AZ.  Was excited to learn we had one here, so I took a trip to the east valley to try it out.  Did not disappoint, we orders the padak chicken (even though I hate all types of onions that aren't fried in batter) and the garlic soy, both offerings were a bit of light crispy deliciousness in every bite. I see a lot of negative words because people aren't prepared for something other than a bucket of fried chicken, don't be discouraged by those. Also the fresh side of radish (daikon) made the meal complete, definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"I like it if you want chicken for your MECJU (beer in Korean).   You can't go wrong with the YANGYAM CHICKEN (green onion on top of fried chicken with sweet and spicy sauce). Get the sauce on the side so you don't get sauce all over your hands when drinking."}
{"text":"It is Friday night, we got here around 7:30pm and there's random folks standing around. There's no system for checking-in to get a table. They told us to just stand in front and wait. We got seated in about 10 minutes which was fine. There were done people who were waiting for a table before us, but they got shafted and we got a table first. Not sure how that works.  We've been waiting for over half an hour and there's no food in sight. I overheard the staff tell customers that \"they don't know why food isn't coming out\" and that we should \"expect to wait over an hour for the food to come out.\"  I get it, you're a new establishment, and you're working out the kinks.. But over an hour? It's fried chicken - you have a system for frying chicken up. Popeye's  Chicken would've tanked in a day if they operated like this. I haven't tasted the food yet... So far, the service and speed is unacceptable. The waiting continues.  We ordered the Sweet and Spicy Full Chicken. To be continued...  Edit 8:33pm - we left. They said it's going to be at least another 20 minutes or more. People are bringing in their own liquor (huge violation - they don't have a liquor license). Customers were upset and leaving. The staff kept making excuses and telling customers he's frustrated too. No, we don't want your empathy, we need your kitchen staff to do something about this. I wanted them to succeed, but they'll fail very soon. There was not one single happy face there."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  One of a fairly lengthy list of places I want to truly love but can't quite yet.  Cutting straight to the chase - this place is fine.  The only place in the Valley to get Korean-style Dungeness crab served up.  Unfortunately, despite the great pains taken by the servers to make eating the crab easier for you (they will cut the crab and mix rice and sauces into the head for you), their efforts do not trump the taste of the crab.  On this last trip, slightly over-cooked, with the meat being plentiful but lacking in fresh crab flavor.  I understand they're trying to get live tank crabs into the joint, and I look forward to that day, but until then, I suggest the crab with reservations.  The chicken is quite good.  Beware, the chicken is all bone-in.  Great for flavor, a little cumbersome to eat.  The best of the sauces, in my opinion, is the garlic soy.  Well balanced with a good garlic kick.  The spicy-sweet sauce tends to be a little too sweet, but is fine.  The paddak chicken sauce (green onion-chicken) is basically the spicy-sweet sauce with the addition of a wasabi sauce on top, which is quite good.  The chicken has been crispy and the portions large, every time I have come.  They have added some regional/speciality dishes such as Andong chicken and kangpunggi which I have yet to try, but I appreciate the effort at diversification.  Stuck in the old Chino Bandido, I fear for this place given its location - set far back from the road with no street signage.  But when I'm in the mood, I'm never loathe to go back and give it another try.  Maybe just not the crab."}
{"text":"We first visited on what was apparently a very busy night for the restaurant.  Although there were a handful of tables available, when we ordered and sat down, we waited 20 min before we received our water.  After 45 min we saw the table next to ours get their food and after 60 min my husband went up to the counter to find out where our order was- after some discussion between the kitchen and the front, they determined that they were \"out of chicken\" and we wouldn't be getting our order. Needless to say, we left. Since we do enjoy Korean fried chicken (BonChon in the Bay Area is our favorite) we decided to try again.  This time we ordered honey butter garlic chicken and the sweet and mild chicken to go.  It was ok- the garlic is very strong.  Needless to say, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"I went with a group of 5 really good friends and these dudes love food. We convinced each other to get 4 plates of chicken. We ordered: Fried Padak Chicken, Garlic Soy Sauce Chicken, Sweet and Spicy Chicken, and Extreme Spicy Chicken.   My crab loving friend also ordered the crab at $16.00 a pound (this is market price so the price varies).  My friend loved the crab and me and the others agreed it was cooked well. If you really like Asian steamed crab in its essence, this place is a pretty good place to get it.  Overall for the chicken, I wish the cuts were smaller (I don't like a huge fried breast in my pile of chicken), have it a bit more crunchier, and for the saucy ones, have a bit less sauce, or have a more stickier sauce that clings to the chicken better.  It took us about an hour and a half for us to get our chicken. However, I admire the server's resilience in dealing with this situation. Especially with a new restaurant, it's super tough to really work out all the kinks. We know something went wrong with the kitchen but it's really none of our business to find out. When I peeked my head through there to investigate (because I'm a jerk) it looks like they were understaffed so someone must have walked out or something. Maybe they ran out of inventory because they were so busy.  Either way, because of the wait, we got some free coleslaw, which was alright. I wish the servers gave us more napkins and filled our water better but I think they were under so much stress, that they had to let it pass.  I know it's a new restaurant but it's still important data to note. I was fuming mad I waited so long. However, their food is pretty darn good so I have high hopes for this restaurant and I wouldn't want it to suffer because of long wait times. I know it will get better."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for quite a while now since it's right down the road and it did not disappoint.   Chicken is pretty darn good and enough to peak my curiousity on their other chicken items.   Warning: The spicy is very spicy and I love spicy food but will go mild next time.   Ordering times are about 15-20 minutes because food is fresh and made to order so next time will call ahead.    Price is between $9-$15 for half and whole chickens which is very fair - I ordered the half and it's good for two people easy.  My only advice is because they're not allowed a sign on the street, they need more than a flag, maybe a guy in a crazy chicken costume or something.   Chino bandito's was in this location and I completely forget they were even in there which, aside from being overrated, was I'm sure their downfall."}
{"text":"Happy to find a korean chicken place in AZ. This is in the space that Chino Bandino used to be loved that they kept the Panda Bandit. The Place: When walking in its a huge venue. One could rent out the place if they wanted for a dinner party or family gathering or company luncheon. They have two flat screen TVs and a stage. Well, when we walked in there was only 1 other korean family it was pretty quiet. They really need music playing for more energy in the restaurant. The owner came out to greet us and was very nice.   The Food: We ordered the shrimp  Fried rice & Half Sweet &spicy chicken. The sweet & spicy chicken is garlicy, sweet and sticky. The portion was pretty big and we were stuffed. The hubs usually just orders mild but the wings weren't spicy.   Shrimp Fried rice was smaller than I expected. It had a lot of butter and soy sauce. I would say skip rice for more chicken!   ***They are doing a super bowl Sunday special!  .50 cents per wing and they also do delivery within 5 miles of the area We are definitely coming back for a chicken fix. Support local business!"}
{"text":"It's ok. Nothing really to write home about here. The service leaves much to be desired but it is a dive Korean style restaurant.  You can't get Korean food here they pretty much just make the fried chicken and chicken wings. We asked for it extreme spicy wish very rarely in this town will be a spicy dish but this one actually was. On the downside The seasoning was just over-the-top and really thick and cakes on. It was extremely spicy though. Which was good.  The wings were very bland and we didn't care for those. The eggrolls were pretty horrible."}
{"text":"Very very good!  Never had Korean fried chicken before and it was very tasty. Super crispy and not greasy. Can't wait to try other flavors."}
{"text":"The rice is amazing ! The portions are huge and they are friendly ! Great customer service"}
{"text":"Very friendly and helpful in choices from the menu. At first it was hard to find since it was tucked away behind the little shopping strip. Very quiet at the time that we stubbed a pond this new restaurant."}
{"text":"CHI MEK!!!!  Dude, seriously, there are few things I love more than fried chicken and beer, well maybe soju..  I've read complaints about service here, but I experienced none of it.. in fact I thought service was friendly and nice.. but then again I speak enough Korean to pass so that maybe why.   Walking in I wondered if they did enough business to fill this giant place, but heard they have been around for awhile now, and I hope they stay. Hidden away in the back of a strip mall, the place is really unassuming, but huge. It has a few televisions, and what looked like a karaoke spot.   Food wise I got the spicy padak chicken, and while not extremely spicy, I regretted that decision the next day. Putting the green onions on top is a nice touch, though I'm not a fan of the wasabi sauce, so I omitted adding it. The pickled radish is spot on too. I was happy to see Hite beer and Chaminsul Soju, which apparently you can't buy unless your a business due to the alcohol content or something? Anyways good to know I can at least get it when I dine here.  I can honestly say I'm a fan after this visit, and the fact that it's so close is a major bonus. Getting a to go order, the food was still piping hot when I got home. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love Korean fry chicken but this place  was terrible. The chicken was too much tuff. I think they use old frozen chicken.  It just my opinion. Also the chicken had lots of black part. It could they didn't change the oil often. The last thing I disappointed was source. Here Korean style spicy source just not Korean style. Too salty. But the service was great. The server was so kind. I hope this my options will good affect to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I came across this place through Instagram, bestfoodphoenix. It couldn't have happened at a better time as I was having a serious craving for Korean style fried chicken. I'm from Vancouver BC and there's many Korean restaurants. With that being said I was not disappointed at all!! We ordered the garlic soy chicken (half order) and Padak spicy chicken (half order). My favourite was the garlic soy chicken which reminded me of the flavours I was used to back in Vancouver. My boyfriend preferred the Padak. Both were very flavourful and juicy. They come with pickled radish and salad. We also ordered sides of white rice. We left stuffed with plenty of left overs. I would say 2 half orders is more than enough for 2 people. I can't wait to come back and try the crab!"}
{"text":"Alektorophobia is the fear of chickens.  Just in case you were wondering...  As a child of immigrants from Asia, I wasn't raised to be a picky eater so alektorophobia doesn't apply to me.  Fry it, roast it, bake it, broil it, braise it, boil it, et cetera... it's all good!  When a little bird told me [or in this case, I saw an ad in the Chinese newspaper] that there was a new Korean fried chicken place in town, I was all for it. A week later and here we are!  Two of us ordered the Mild Padak Chicken and half a Honey Butter Garlic Chicken.  From what we were told, the Padak Chicken is coated in the Sweet & Mild sauce with the Padak sauce served on the side and topped with shredded, raw, green onions.  Talk about potent.  My breath still stinks a day later.  So my thoughts?  Mild Padak Chicken:  Not spicy at all which is good for you weaklings.  I should have gone with spicy.  While I think the base sauce of the mild & sweet sauce was good, they absolutely drenched the chicken with it.  My suggestion is to ask for easy sauce because it completely overwhelms everything.  So if you're sensitive to that poultry taste like my Twinsie Nadine C. is, you'll be safe.  Now for the actual Padak sauce [a brothy sauce of garlic, vinegar, soy sauce, lemon, and wasabi] itself, woo!  I took a little lick of the sauce at first to gauge how I'd like it and it was like a sharp slap to the face with a wasabi root.  It was tasty!  My mistake comes a few seconds later when I dipped a hot piece of chicken into it and shoved it in my mouth.  As soon as I bit down, tears welled up in my eyes and I was crying liquid eyeliner.  It tastes a thousand times stronger on a hot piece of meat versus a cold spoon.  I didn't make the same mistake twice.  My sinuses cleared, my eyes were watering, and Wasabi made me her bitch.  This stuff is strangely addicting though but definitely use a little at first to see how sensitive you are.  Mmm!  Honey Butter Garlic Chicken:  Delicious!  The flavor fits the dish name perfectly.  Once again, they were a bit heavy-handed on the sauce which made the chicken less crispy but it was damn good.  Pour me a glass of Hite Beer and I'll be set.    All in all, Crazy Chicken & Crab is a solid place!  Prices are a bit high since we're talking chicken here but it's flavorful and served in huge portions.  You can probably split half a chicken between two people.  The whole chicken can feed three to four easily.  So stop in while they still have their 10% off special going.  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I used to come here when this location was Chino Bandido. I was sad to find out that it was no longer here. However, I am glad that another establishment opens up for me to try out. Today, it just seems like a good night to come over (while moonsoon is going on outside).   The menu is pretty simple and prices are relatively reasonable. I wanted to try out so many dishes. For now, I would settle for their chicken wings.  I ordered 24 hot wings - half in honey BBQ flavor and the other half in \"hot\" flavor. For appetizer, we ordered onion rings. Onion rings were very crunchy and not overly oily. As for the chicken wings, I prefer the honey BBQ flavor over the \"hot\". Overall, I think they are both tasty. On my next visit, I definitely want to try their Korean flavor chicken and crazy crabs with a larger party.    It was a slow night and there was only one server working. He told us that he just started working here a week ago. Even though we were his only table, he was very attentive - constantly checking up on us, giving us refill for sodas, and was super humble and friendly. While no one was watching (so he thought anyway), I saw him cleaning the tables and picking up around the place instead of standing around doing nothing. His hard working ethnics reminds me of the days when I was waiting for tables. We made sure to tip him generously especially because it was a slow night. If the owner is reading this, I want you to know what a great server he was and I hope you comp him well. I'll definitely come back here again to try something else. Hopefully I'll get the same server again.  P.S. If you like Soju (Korean wine), they do serve them here."}
