{"text":"Hot, fresh, and well-priced breakfast.  I'm sad I waited to go here in the first place.  The owners treat everyone like family, even during our first trip.  The eggs were cooked perfectly, and my grits were delicious.  Next time we'll try lunch."}
{"text":"Great little family run diner.  Prices are reasonable and food is fresh & tasty!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is just so-so. Maybe I expected too much because of all the great reviews I saw, but I've been twice for breakfast and I've ordered different items each time. Everything was average. Not bad. Not great. Just ok. Maybe I'll go once more and this time try some of the items that other reviewers rated so highly."}
{"text":"Good breakfast. Yummy for your tummy $1.00 . Big pancakes the size of a country , cheesy eggs , cheesy grits , spicy sausage"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. If you like peaceful mornings, hot coffee, fresh food cooked right in front of you, and prompt friendly service, I highly recommend Arline's. It has a \"small-town\" welcoming atmosphere. Very quiet, peaceful, locally owned place to enjoy your morning. Can't say enough good things about it. Today was my first time here, but I will be a regular from now on."}
{"text":"This place was very good for breakfast. Very friendly staff and the food is delish. French toast was great, the country ham was delish."}
{"text":"I love this little place. Awesome people and food. Love the burgers with chilly, grilled chicken sandwich, Philly cheesesteak sandwich, Philly cheese chicken sandwich, breakfast omelettes, sausage gravy biscuit, etc... it's all good. Made fresh to order and priced right. Now open until 8pm on weekdays."}
{"text":"Small Mom and Pop type business,  but great people and great food. Definitely a must go!"}
{"text":"So I've been looking to go to different small mom and pop restaurants. This one is pretty good. 
My son ordered pancakes and bacon. Huge pancakes plus they were delicious. 
My wife and I both ordered omelets. Mine with grits and hers with hash browns. The grits weren't good. I had to add a lot of salt. Her hash browns came out hard and a little over cooked, but they replaced them with another order. They were pretty good when it was cooked right. The omelets were pretty good and they had a big portion of me inside of them.
The best part of the visit was the sweet tea. The tea is delicious. It is a must have"}
{"text":"Arline's is a small Grill located off of Union Road in Gastonia. The food is a little inconsistent but for the most part pretty good for the price.
They can fail when it comes to consistency, 
I find it the breakfast sandwiches a bi too small. The loaf bread was extremely small, the liver mush portion matched It. The sandwich tasted really good,  but three bites and it was over. I definitely wasn't full when I left that day. My favorite item was breakfast bowls. My last couple were not great, they had watery consistency after getting about half way into them.  
The hamburgers are good, better than a lot fast food type places in town.  Their chili can be hit-or-miss. A few times it was so hopped up with chili powder that I couldn't even eat my burger, even after pointing it out to the Cook i couldn't eat it, I still had to pay for it. I did follow up with the owner / management thinking I'd give them a chance make it right but that didn't happen.
The french fries and onion Rings, cheese sticks etc are frozen so there's really not much to brag about their. Out of all their size the onion rings are the best.
 The staff is always been very friendly. Some are much better at the job than others. I've had times when I was left staring at food needing a drink refill while they carried on conversations at other tables.
The napkin holders at the counter are odd, There are photos of people int them, makes you feel like a stranger is staring at you eating. I asked about that one day and I was told that those are regulars, and that was their seats,... to someone who eats their two and three times a week, that was the day I found out I wasn't a regular.

Their hours are very sketchy. Be sure you check before you go. They change them a lot. When I first found the place they were closed at dinner, then they opened, built up clientele and now they stopped dinner hours again......."}
{"text":"A slice of Americana with tasty but inexpensive food. I had the breakfast bowl with grits and bacon. Why have toast when you can have a biscuit."}
{"text":"The food was 4-star, but service was only a 2-star.  Probably caught them on an off-day, but I would revisit and recommend."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and great quantity of food for the price, id definitely recommend it. STRONG 5 stars!!! Great service and amazing waiters"}
{"text":"Always looking for small family-operated restaurants serving good southern food. This is one of the best I've been to in a while. They serve breakfast all day. The liver mush and cheese omelet was terrific and the sweet tea was spot on. Top that off with a grilled biscuit covered in gravy and you've earned my 5-stars!"}
{"text":"Only ate breakfast here, never had a bad meal. Can be crowded, place is small. Prices are very reasonable, and service is good. Try a grilled biscuit, very tasty and their pancakes are light and tasty."}
{"text":"Really nice little place to grab breakfast. All fresh ingredients used to make the omelets and hash browns. Generous portions served up. Friendly staff. Great experience."}
{"text":"Awesome Philly cheesesteak! They are a little slow on service but great hole in the wall!"}
{"text":"Great find!  homey family atmosphere, and amazing food! I had their grilled chicken plate with fried okra and it was absolutely great.  Id recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"They have amazing food and the prices are perfect! Not to mention the service there is impeccable! The waitress is very attentive and super sweet! We always love going here it's me and my boyfriends little breakfast spot and we love it to death!!"}
{"text":"11:30 on a Saturday morning and every seat is filled. I order an omelette, which comes with hash browns or grits, biscuit or toast. Sitting at the counter, I check out the other customers - old, young, black, white, couples, families - good Gastonian mix of folks. Waitresses clearly know many of their customers & customers chat, table to table. On the wall and on the staff, Arline's Grill t-shirts in several colors, each with a fried egg in the shape of a heart and, on the back, the words Breakfast & Lunch Served All Day.. Food is good - nothing fancy, but hot and tasty. Unfortunately, service is not great. Waited a long time, after the food arrived, for a knife and fork. Never offered a coffee refill. Service seems much more attentive for regulars who are known by their names. Too bad - I had hoped to find a good Sat. breakfast spot!"}
