{"text":"If you don't want to prepare and just wanna stay in, this place is awesome. Quick delivery, decent food and decent price. For 2 people you have enough leftovers for next day's lunch! Lol. I like the salt and spicy shrimps! Combos have great variety not too shabby!"}
{"text":"Okay, I'll be honest, if you're looking for authentic Chinese food, keep looking. But I placed an order through Just Eat today, Combo A for 1 person.

First of all, the food arrived in fifteen minutes! I'm not even particularly close to the restaurant!  Fifteen minutes! It was piping hot and smelled great.

Second of all, I don't know who this \"1 person\" is that they have in mind when preparing this food but they can sure eat a lot. There is easily enough food to feed me for two or even three meals.

Third of all, the food is solid. It's not going to blow your mind with intricate flavours, but if you want some good old Canadianized Chinese food, this is it. I do wish the hot and sour soup and the general tao chicken were a touch spicier, but they were good anyway. All of the food was really good. Not great but perfect comfort food.

Fourth of all, the price! All this cost me less than $20 including tax and tip.

Conclusion: I will definitely be ordering from Super Noodles many more times in the future. Fast delivery, decent food, good price."}
{"text":"This place is pathetic and will jump on any occasion to rip their clients off. Most restaurants charge extra delivery fees so that's acceptable. However, once the order was placed online, we get a call saying that there's extra cost if we want to pay by card instead of cash. We agreed to that. Then the girl adds that if we want our crispy noodles to be crispy, there's an extra charge for that too... yet the menu from which we chose from EXPLICITLY mentioned that the noodles we ordered were crispy so why want to charge us an extra if the noodles are already supposed to be crispy? That's when you know you're dealing with extremely cheap people that charge you extra at any opportunity just to make some money off of people when it doesn't even cost them anything more. Disgusting way to run a business and the food isn't even worth all those extra charges."}
{"text":"Went to eat there thinking it was the same as their old location on monkland. I was disappointed to learn it was not. It was dim and grimy. It was very run down and not clean feeling at all. The food was really not very good. Mediocre at best. Wasted my limited budget on food we couldn't even finish."}
{"text":"Don't go expecting exotic cuisine of any kind, but it is amazing food if you're jonesing for a great little noodle dish.
Portions are HUGE and really well priced.
The restaurant itself isn't exactly fancy but I only get takeout so I can sit on the couch and pig out in my jammies."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here more then a few times.The food is good and they are generous with the portions.HOWEVER the last 3 times I have hungrily waited over a hr and im a 4 min drive...come on now."}
{"text":"Arrived quickly. Combo F was more than enough for 2 people. Food was good minus the chicken balls, were a little harder than usual to eat."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, never too many people, and the food is usually great. Be waru, sometimes battered chicken (general tao, lemon chicken, etc...) Will be over battered and overcooked. Soups, rolls, and noodles always great. 

The staff is very nice, service is fast, takeout is free. There are some tables and chairs stacked near the entrance, bit of an eyesore but the place is lit so dark you won't even notice.

I was nervous my first time because the sign looks a bit dated, as does the decor. However the food is great and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Used to love this place. My order today has changed my tune. I paid for 3 orders or spring rolls listed on the online and physical menu they supplied (with this order) at 2 spring rolls. Although I should have gotten 6, I only got 3. They weren't the size of 2 either. Called the delivery man who made excuses about a new supplier, the lady called from the restaurant to argue with me as well. $6 after tax/delivery charges of my order for 3 spring rolls? Seriously? The soup was ok but you would think they would have  included a spoon, the beef and broccoli was disappointing considering I have never received so little meat from ANY Chinese restaurant for this dish. I paid $10 for a portion of rice, broccoli and sauce. Very disappointed since this has been my favorite Chinese takeout for the last 2 years."}
{"text":"Super noodles has good Chinese food! I delivered but I usually dine in there.  Since Super Noodles opened more than a year ago I dined there five times plus one time delivery tonight Now I know why the owners chose the name Super Noodles because it is scrumptious, tantalizing delicious! Chinese food is good in Montreal, Quebec But Super Noodles is one of a kind! I think the restaurant even serves Sushi dishes? Anyways if you are craving for Chinese food then I highly recommend Super Noodles! A experience you surely won't forget! Michael Elman"}
{"text":"What a terrible place! Ordered two dishes instead of one, just to get extra vegetables, and yet they only managed to give me a few pieces of broccoli. See photo attached... That small plate is mixed vegetables (extra spicy)
.
Asked for super spicy food, they give sweet instead..

While placing my order the chef rushed out of the kitchen with a plate of food yelling at me as if it was my fault for him getting delayed in getting the order to the table...

Absolutely disgusting waste of an evening meal with food that's worse than garbage.

I would give negative ratings if I could"}
{"text":"Only problem is they don't take debit. Great food, great pieces and free delivery fee"}
