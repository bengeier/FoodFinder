{"text":"This place is great, their food is great, but they're never open. On many occasions I've gone to get food there, 2-4 hours after they are supposedly open, just to find out they are still closed. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"This place has been here for as long as I remember, serving cheap East Asian food (Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, Fusion) in cheap and large quantities. I went here on more than one occasion, choosing to take-out rather than dine-in. The restaurant appears to cater to delivery and take-out clientele. The interiors are very basic and cheap, I certainly wouldn't want to have a sit-down dinner.  I have tried their Pad Thai (mediocre noodles with little vegetables but lots of colouring) and chicken stir fry (alright but not great). If you accidentally stumble upon this place you'll find the food just okay (won't get you sick) but for me the cheap price doesn't warrant eating mediocre fast food."}
{"text":"Great little take out Chinese place. No real competition in the area but they don't slack on the quality. Ingredients always taste fresh. Just wish they had a full menu online or to pick up but I guess those things cost some money. I feel they would do great with all of the condos in the area if only ppl new it was there"}
{"text":"I was really craving some noodles with beef and since moving to the area I had yet to find my go-to Chinese food take-out/delivery place. Of course I Yelped it out and found Yummy Chinese food just a short bike ride away. I also googled them to see if i could find a menu online but they don't have their own website (FYI, when i picked up my order i asked her for a take-out menu and she directed me to their FB page https://www.facebook.com/YummyChineseFoodRestaurant?fref=ts ). I just called up and ordered the Beef Chow Mein. Figured I can't really go wrong with that, right?   When i got my food home it was hot and smelled great. But when i opened it up, the noodles seemed a bit dry. Oh well... i dug deeper to see if there was the glorious pool of sauce waiting for me at the bottom of my take-out container. *sigh* I was sadly disappointed. No sauce pool.  I love sauce. I especially love saucy noodles. Too bad so sad for me this time.  It's not enough for me to completely give up on Yummy Chinese Food, I'll try again. Maybe a different dish. But for now, I'm left unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Yummy Chinese Food is at the corner of Queen and Wilson Park Ave in Parkdale.  It's been around forever as far as I know.  If you walk by, you'll see their yellow and green menu posted on the window.  It has like 4 tables inside and is definitely set up for take-out.    Their menu is extensive; appetizers, soups, fried rice, sweet and sour, curry, egg foo young, chop suey, sauces, noodles, chicken, beef, bbq pork, shrimp, veg and pad thai options to choose from.  Not expensive.  I have ordered their kung pow beef and shangai noodles.  Both were okay.. nothing to write home about.  Better reheated the next day with garlic chili sauce.   I have also ordered the classic; chicken balls, fried rice, egg rolls... I would order that again next time because the noodles and beef weren't fantastic. Oh I also ordered their hot and sour soup. It was VERY thick. I didn't mind it, but I could see how that would be a texture issue for some.  It was tasty though. Lots of stuff in it. Not sure if it came out of a can though and that's why it was so thick.   They also have a bunch of dinner and lunch specials.  Like my star rating says, I've experienced better... but I'll order from them if I want something quick and cheap. Not a bad deal and the food is always hot."}
{"text":"Dont let the interior fool you...get your food to go and you'll be happy with this yummy food at home :)  The people working here were very friendly; prices very reasonable.   I liked the kung poa chicken and chicken Lo mein.  Flavor and spice were just right."}
{"text":"Took a while to build up the courage to write a review about this place.  I don't want to be intimidated by the aggressive social media guru son AGAIN (see facebook page)    I was totally unsatisfied by the price/flavor ratio.  This food didn't taste bad; it was just super bland. And that's NOT okay when you're spending $30 on 2 menu items...If I wanted bland food that looked attractive, I'd eat a professional photo of general tao.  I thought I was gonna get top notch chinese food with plentiful portions. WRONG.   I was surprised when the delivery guy offered to pick up the food (via fb) and give a refund.  When he called, he said you can't have eaten a lot of it or I wont get the refund.... I was like no prab!  He sounded kinda mad so I asked if he was gonna have an attitude about it and he said no. WRONG.    He came, opened the chicken was like, you and ur friends ate too much...I'm like what friends? :S TELL ME MORE about these friends. You know my cats??  Then he said he'll only give me SOME of my money back. He said the tax went through already and it was $8 and the system cant unprocess...and yadda yadda...and I was like, I work in the financial district and I KNOW this is some BULL... After that, I got most of my money back...u can keep the tip bruh, just spare me the 2nd hand smoke.  I can't tell you how much sass was projected from his face that night.  He was SMOKING inside my building...iz u serious??? BRUH  meh"}
{"text":"This is our go to Chinese restaurant we've been using for five years now. It's a family run business run by only a husband and wife, who have their son run occasional deliveries.   Their sweet and sour pork is very tender and tasteful. The wonton soup always comes with fresh veggies and a great broth. I've never had them skimp on meat and veggies in any noodle dish either.  While the food is good, the five star rating is partial because of the people that run this business. They are always incredibly welcoming and nice. We had an order before where they forgot to soft drinks. We didn't bother calling up to complain and just let it be. When we ordered from them three months later, they remembered their mistake and gave us our drinks for free on that order. Any time they feel their delivery was running late, they'll apologize sincerely, and they accommodate request made for dishes not on the menu.  Price wise, they're very good as well. A couple can order two dishes for well under $20 and you'll have plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day. If you're in the area, give them a try."}
{"text":"Friday night dinner. Delicious.  Had the Almond Soo-guy, chicken fried rice and GT chicken.  Based on other delivery options and past experience we'll definitely be ordering from here again."}
