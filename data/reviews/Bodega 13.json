{"text":"First time here.  Excellent service.  Austin, our server was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu and wine pairings.  We ordered the duck tacos, mussels, smoke salmon and lamb lollipops. Each of the items were cooked perfectly, well seasoned and presented.  I can't wait to bring a group of friends back to this fantastic north Scottsdale hangout."}
{"text":"New business open 6 months...international tapas with a great wine list, good selection of on tap beers, great service   Need to give it a try!"}
{"text":"Tapas are scrumptious and restaurant design is welcoming and unique. This restaurant has personality. We go with friends as often as we can especially, their happy hour."}
{"text":"Recently went here for dinner. Usually when we go for Tapas, we share. We graze, we drink, we graze some more. There was a strange menu here, out of sync with the name of the restaurant and with the decor. To be frank, it was a \"hot mess\".  There were a few memorable food items, but not the Tapas or main course. The desert the Tahitian Pearl was creative and and very good, chocolate ball shell filled with vanilla ice cream and drizzled with warm caramel sauce. I would love to see the menu reworked-- obviously the owners love the South Pacific based on their signature desert and lovely decor, so how about \"pupu\" from Hawaii, logo or kokoda from Fiji?  Please no meatballs or pork belly or poor renditions of Spanish Tapas."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant. We went on a Tuesday night and all ordered tapas. They were all very tasty, especially the scallop under glass (a must try) and the veggie tacos. Then for dessert we ordered the Tahitian Pearl. It was amazing. Our server, Malia, was very helpful and did a great job. Thank you. We will be back."}
{"text":"We pulled into Scottsdale late Christmas night and found this little gem still open. The decor and ambiance are stunning! The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful while owner kept us in stitches. And then there was the food, absolutely delicious!!! Shareable bites from around the globe. We will definitely be going back to finish off all the tapas we didn't get to try. A Scottsdale \"must try\"!"}
{"text":"Came here for my Dads bday and late Father's Day dinner. We not only had the amazing tapas (dates were our fav followed by meatballs and can't go wrong with the shrimp and chorizo) but the seafood paella was over the top. Emily was so friendly the experience couldn't have been any better. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, friendly staff, great atmosphere and good food. I had the spinach salad with salmon, loved it. Soon it will nice to sit on their patio outside."}
{"text":"Excellent lollipop lamb chops this evening. The owner, Larry and his wife Emily were very welcoming to my party. A very comfortable setting and perfectly trendy."}
{"text":"An exceptionally well-rounded restaurant with multiple international dishes that come out of the kitchen with pizazz!   The kind and thoughtful wait staff makes the evening even more enjoyable.   We have dined here twice and have had an amazing dinner and ambiance each time.  Recommend to those who want to enjoy great food in a comfortable and joyful atmosphere."}
{"text":"The service was terrible and the food even worst. All the dishes look exactly alike. I ordered chichen piccata and it was anything but that. It took over a hour for the dinner to come out. Part of the dish was hot and other cold.  There were only 5 tables of people in the whole place. I will not be going back there."}
{"text":"What a great find! Love the Paella, in particular. The staff is extremely friendly. Really enjoy the live music on the weekends."}
{"text":"Paella night - best seafood paella since Barcelona. Super fresh seafood, perfectly cooked rice with right textured crust. Service good, and price - well a hell of a lot less than going to Spain. Would I recommend Bodega 13? Give you one guess!"}
{"text":"Spot on.  Nice room, great service but still laid back dinning.  Love the quality and presentation.  Prices are reasonable and the staff and owners aim to please, and succeed!! I found a facebook Bodega 13 site with more photos of the room and food.

Great room, service food and a varied and creative menu.  I eat meat and my wife only seafood and vegetarian and she has no issue getting a good meal.



We have come for Sunday breakfast, lunches and dinners and it has been a great experience each time.


BTW outdoor patio maybe dog friendly."}
{"text":"I am sad to have to post this review. My husband and I dined here for the first time with our friends. We WONT be returning....
The room and decor were inviting, but it all ended there. 
The service was SO slow.  Took us 15 minutes after being seated to get water. Then wine. 
We waited almost an hour after ordering to get our food!!  Only once did server come by and say it would be coming \"soon\". 
When the food finally arrived we were ALL disappointed.  The salmon was raw and mushy...the chicken/ veggie stir fry was dry and then soaked in soy sauce. The trout was laying over mushy vegetables covered in a thick white sauce. 
The owners are nice and apologized. Gave us a free dessert.
I hope for their sake it improves. I think the menu is way to big to get that many items right. 
Unfortunately, I won't be giving it a second chance..."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. The soup was cold and when we sent  it back to get hot it took 10 minutes to get it back.  Additionally we ordered 4 different dishes and they all looked alike. The chicken piccata was not lemony nor she d it have capers. Everything looked like a stir fry and was bland. Not recommended. Also took almost 2 hours!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed some wine and tapas while awesome music from Stephanie which was great.  Had the olives and the honey shrimp.   Both very good.  Tried the red flights which were good, but would select the Columbia blend Which I had later if I came back.  Lobster bisque was excellent."}
{"text":"Went there on a Monday night, very quiet (not even any music). Food quality was great, but portion sizes were small even for a tapas restaurant. The draft beer system was down, so there was only one draft option. We sat on the patio, but had to move inside due to a big mosquito problem. My wife has 18 mosquito bites from our short stay on the patio.  Overall it was just ok, not great.  Had the facility been better shape, I would have rated it higher."}
{"text":"Discovered this restaurant in Carefree and loved the food. Have followed it to Scottsdale and brought friends on 4 other occasions and all have thoroughly enjoyed the food and decor.
The owners are very gracious and concerned about the patrons and the staff are very attentive. 

The Duck Tacos are should not be missed but my wife stays with the Mussels  until the paella arrives.

{"text":"Was there for dinner this week.  Had plans with another couple to go back on weekend.  Cancelled those plans.  Service was poor, portions small, prices high.  Chicken was Luke warm and dry. 

Martini glass half full and had to go to bar to remind them of order after not served in  half hour.  manager has no clue on talking to customers for feedback.  Every bad review is worth 10 good ones and this is that one.  Oh yes, checked the bill and charged for more drinks than we ordered.

J Scottsdale"}
{"text":"What a refreshing change for Carefree/cave Creek!! The food is awesome. Service (Yanies!!!) is wonderful and the atmosphere is spot on. Love sitting at the bar or the chefs table - we are excited to go back for live music and seafood paella !! Yum"}
{"text":"This place is a gem with an international menu. The seafood paella was excellent just like the service Lauren provided. We'll be back to try the other varieties of paella and the wide range of hot and cold tapas offered."}
{"text":"Decent food, friendly but slow service.  

Stopped here during a vacation to Scottsdale.  The food is good, but the menu misleading.  The cheese and fruit tray misses the fruit, the petits and tartlets misses the tartlets.  As to the cheese, the selection of cheese is underwhelming and contains no Manchego--bit of a mystery for a Spanish style restaurant.  

On the positive side the staff is very friendly, the cocktails were great and the stuffed dates are phenomenal.   

Overall grade would be a B-.  Decent, but not outstanding."}
{"text":"Our evening last night started with a warm welcome by Larry, who was very inviting and engaging.  We were so glad that we made reservations as the place was packed.  We wanted to try a little bit of everything family style.  Our amazing server Caesar gave us his favorites, and we went with his recommendations.  All of the dishes were wonderful, but we loved the chicken curry and seafood paella the most.  Of course the highlight was the Tahitian Pearl, especially with the rules from Larry that preceded us greedily digging in.  Let's just say spoon fights are allowed!  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Would give zero stars if I could.  Appetizers were mediocre, lamb, tuna and chicken pad Thai were inedible. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Group of 10 ordered drinks which were good if not a bit high priced. Many of the tapas were sampled. Favorites were bacon covered dates and lamb chops. Ceviche not very good, duck tacos ok. Paella was very expensive and poor. We complained  that bottom 1/4 was totally burnt black, leaving the dish tasting quite burnt. I credit the Cook for coming out to apologize and he provided a free dessert dish which was tasteful and they discounted the paella."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this new place! Great service, great wines, great adventurous food for this area, and great prices too. The ambiance was cosy, we sat outside on the rear patio, before the music got under way. Sharing these lovely tapas makes for a fun evening, and we were well satisfied eating 4 between the two of us. Chicken tandoori skewers were nicely charred and flavored, pork brochette was good, with a super dipping sauce. We also had the ceviche, yummy, but would have been better with a few chips for scooping rather than using forks, and lamb lollipops, which were equally yummy. The remodel from the old Cellar 13 has improved the capabilities of the kitchen no end, and the whole space feels much more as if it was meant to be this way, rather than so chopped up the way it was before. Well done and welcome to Carefree"}
{"text":"My husband & i stopped  in to Bodega 13  the day before thanksgiving , because we wanted something light before the big turkey day.  We had such a good time !! The decor  is very interesting & cool ! I ordered the portabello mushroom sandwich (not tapas), and it was amazing! I also had  the lobster bisque soup, which was also very good ! My husband ordered the grilled cheese which was tasty but on the small side . !  Our server was Austin , who  we affectionately called him \"Awesome  Austin\". He WAS awesome, friendly, attentive & made me a special cocktail!  Great guy. The place is a little hidden but that's what I liked about it , a hidden gem. We will come back ."}
{"text":"Very unique to the valley.  Life is to be enjoyed.  The diverse tastes and textures take dining to a new level"}
{"text":"Multiple tastes-flavors-textures: 2 super Tapas-enjoy the diversity: pair with Sicilian red wino"}
{"text":"Really great food at great prices. We happened to be able to get a date night and wanted to try this new place out. What a great find! Live music with great service. The food came out quickly with wonderful presentation. It was really surprising to find out the place had just opened! I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and while some dishes were good, it was extremely overrated and way over priced.  The price of the Tapas was the price of most meals.  The Lamb Lollipops and Curry Chicken were good, but not for the cost.  Always willing to try new places, but this one will not be on our list again."}
{"text":"Who'd have thought you'd find gourmet tapas in Carefree? The paella is particularly good, and I'm partial to the beef tenderloin as well. The blue cheese stuffed dates are a good way to start your meal."}
{"text":"Really good food and atmosphere. Owners are hands on and make sure you are taken care of. Lots of top shelf bourbon selections and good patio area to enjoy a stick and their impressive wine selection. Take advantage of their chef's table if you can and make sure to try their signature dates tapas and pearl dessert!"}
{"text":"A perfect date night or celebration dinner choice.  The atmosphere is classy, elegant and just perfect, for any occasion. The service is delightful and friendly.  And the food is gourmet.  This is a go to place. We loved the tapas, and this time tried the entrees.  From presentation to \"down the hatch\", it was  perfect. You won't go home hungry, either. Our cocktails were over the top, with just the right amount of ingredients.  Try it, you'll like it. And the prices are easy on the budget."}
{"text":"This was our first experience having dinner at Bodega 13, and decided to try because we've loved lunch so much there. It's tastefully decorated, good ambience but we won't be back for dinner, and will only give lunch one more try, because we haven't visited in a while. I noted a few negative experiences on another site, causing me to question why. This place used to have the most flavorful food. Our favorites were the vegetarian tacos and the ceviche. They weren't bad at dinner either but were missing a lot of the robust flavors they had only a few months ago at lunch, flavors that had us giving the idea of \"vegetarian\" serious consideration. Lack of flavor and filling reduced to half (in the tacos) had us wondering what happened? Another unfortunate let-down was the time it took to receive anything, 30 min to receive the appetizer of ceviche (really?), with patrons at 4 tables inside, none outside, and the bar was half filled, 2 waitresses on staff. We had finished eating the 4 items ordered, brought to us one at a time (fine by us) before our son received his kid's meal - 45 min after ordering.  Little kids will never sit that long, and therefore one should rethink bringing kids. After no drink refills (out of water before dinner) and with empty glasses, the waitress asked if she could get us anything. Drinks. Drinks would be good with dinner. They do have a kids menu, but no regular fries with the burger or chicken fingers - only sweet potato, we were advised. Fruit salad as part of the kid's side, incl. cucumber, jicama, mango - tasty for most us, but many kids not a fan of veggies will spot the green 'villain' and refuse it.  The flavor, however, works - is refreshing. In sum, I'm not sure if they switched chefs/have a new one, but the attention to detail in flavor, filling and service at this dinner fell by the wayside, compared to lunch, which was a completely opposite and positive experience, service and food. When I left, I had a better understanding of some of the other reviews on another site that I had initially disagreed with."}
{"text":"I wish I could give negative stars. This restaurant was by far the worst restaurant I've ever dined at. The service was awful. Buyer shouldn't not beware after this post. The food was awful. Absolutely awful. 7 people struggled to eat the tapas and entires. 7 people should devour food not sit back and look at it. Robbed us of our money. Regret ever going there"}
{"text":"Loved this new restaurant in North Scottsdale!!  Decor and atmosphere was excellent and music on Friday nite was a real treat!!  The food selection allows for a lite meal with tapas and
small plates as well as entrees that are very intriguing !!!  Prices are very nice and a great selection of wines.  Owners were wondering around visiting and making sure all the guests were enjoying!!!  I am taking my girlfriend there again today for lunch for her birthday!!!"}
{"text":"Picked this one off Yelp. Wonderful surprise. Amazing lunch. Great atmosphere. Delicious food. Highly recommend. Already have reservations for dinner."}
{"text":"First time to visit this establishment and we were impressed right away with the decor and the feel of the space. A little funky, a little eclectic which is right up our alley.

We did the meat lovers paella which is paraded around the room with a burning sprig of rosemary. The duck was very tasty along with the chicken and the chorizo. Lots of flavors in that huge skillet! We had numerous small plates and they were all delicious.The lamb  chop lolli pops were a hit and the date tapas were out of this world!

The owners were friendly and the Tahitian Pearl dessert was as good to eat as it was fun.

We will be returning."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Bodega on Saturday March 18m 2018 and was pleasantly surprise by the whole experience. Greeted warming upon entering and seated immediately, had a reservation. The food selections were just as described on the menu. The cocktails and wine exceeded expectations. It can be difficult to have every wine available by the glass but several of the selections were only available by the bottle. The server and service was excellent and we felt like a welcome guest. Will stop in again."}
{"text":"Went here the other night for the first time. I never knew this place was here as it is kind of tucked away. Ambience was nice, quaint. Food was very good, mostly a tapas place if you want to eat affordably. However forget ordering main dishes if you don't want to spent $150 for 2! This place is super over priced for the quantity of food. I mean $14 for tapas! Please! It was good but not that good! I will not go back just from the waitstaff alone! Really indifferent and not friendly! I doubt this place will last despite having some potential. Binkleys had the right idea on customer service and I was glad to spend my money there. Not this place. Sorry, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Our bartender was awesome,but that was about it.  The owner nor the manager gave us a second look.  Although we are in our mid 30's and live a half a mile down the road, we look a lot younger and the owner/manager never gave us a second look even though they talked with everybody around us that were clearly over 30.  We ordered only tapas, so we could taste a variety.  The prices are above normal tapas food, but if the food was amazing we wouldn't mind.  The mussels were just okay, market street cafe way better.  The beef tenderloin was so salty we couldn't finish it. (We usually everything).  Also ordered a cold tapas with salmon and trout... they left out the trout and when we asked about it the waiter said \"oh we must be out\"... ( no they didn't take it off our bill or offer us something else).  The lamb lollipop was not horrible, but have definitely had better.  We really wanted to like this place because we can walk to it and atmosphere was good.  But the food won't keep this place afloat unless they make it better.  We will go back once more to try their paella, but if it's a bust we are done.  Overall, not impresses in the least."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. After hearing various recommendations from family friends, I decided to try it out for evening dinner. While my guest and I were deciding on what to order, we were greeted by, not only the host, but the waiter (as expected), *and* the owner. Which, at first seemed understanding. I ordered an entree, tapa, and alcoholic beverage. The food was average. The prices were a little high for tapas. Legitimate tapas from Spain are meant to be cheap appetizers / snacks, not almost full-priced entrees. I understand the theme of this restaurant is international and not just Spanish. However, the concept of a tapa originated from Spain and was not accurately represented at this restaurant. 

Side note: The menu was also painful to look at. An international restaurant incorrectly represented the Spanish flag as the Peruvian flag, the word 'Caribbean' was misspelt and represented by the Jamaican flag, Austria's flag was shown as Germany's flag, and Thailand and Tahiti had the same flag. That was just very sad.

In all, my dining experience was subpar. The reason for this is that we were approached by MULTIPLE employees, MULTIPLE times throughout our 1.5 hour-long meal. The owner kept trying to push a Jazz Night down our throats as we were taking bites of our food! I appreciate the owner's intentions on checking up on her customers, but the owners also need to understand that we would just like to enjoy our meal without being constantly approached. That's what a waiter is for! I think me and my guest were approached *at least* nine separate times while we tried to finish our meal. That was unacceptable, and for that reason, I will not be recommending this restaurant nor will I be returning. 

It is also sad to see the owner's responses on people's reviews, as if he was constantly trying to blame the customer for writing a bad review, while also trying to deflect and excuse himself. That is also very immature and unacceptable. This restaurant has potential, but the owners are draining every ounce of it."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a cool vibe and is decorated beautifully!! The bacon wrapped blue cheese stuffed dates with a red wine glaze is TO DIE FOR! So yummy. Also, the duck tacos and the Caesar salad are amazing! 
The waitress we had was super nice and the owner was here as well; he is great and makes sure that everyone has a great experience. 
Highly recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"Bodega 13 is definately as good as it gets!  Definately my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  Such a favorite that my husband threw my 60 birthday at this culinery delight with family and close friends and even my new born grandson!  Love their tapas as well as delightful Valencian paellas and international tapas.  The best part though to be is the out of this world Tahitian Pearl and the table presentation.  A special thank you to Bart (Barry) an awesome waiter and always love talking to the former Cincinnatian owner Larry and his wife! Looking forward to coming back soon!  I will try to post pictures as well."}
{"text":"First visit this evening.  Really happy to have a new addition in town and hoping for a good meal.  
Service - prompt and efficient 
Menu - tapas  and choices felt unsatisfying and lacking somehow.  
Flavor - quite good.  Ordered the shrimp and chorizo, salty but good.  2 shrimps, $10.  Served with one measly price of French bread...   Olives, about 8 with two pieces of small artichoke heart and some red pepper and 1 piece of bread... $6, that's fine.   Caesar salad - approximately 1/2 cup of lettuce to the order $8.  Tandoori chicken - good flavor.  4 tenderloins at $9 (I believe).  Probably the best value.  All in all the food was fine but, a terrible value.  I have no problem paying but, give me value!   1/2 a cup of lettuce....really.  That's garnish not a salad and 1 slice of tiny bread?  An okay but measly meal - we left hungry.   Came home and ate cheese and salami.   Funny the table next to us asked for more bread and were told they would be charged for it.  They passed.   I've been to loads of Tapa's bars and never been serves such tiny amounts."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant!  The atmosphere was absolutely spectacular,  and was so unique!  The food was unbelievably good, in fact- I would say one of the best burgers I have ever had.  We went to the restaurant during the day, and the waitstaff was attentive and super helpful.  They are a newer restaurant, but certainly take great care of their patrons.  The owner, Larry, came over and introduced himself.  It was a wonderful experience overall, I would highly recommend dining at Bodega 13!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, service and food! They have amazing Tapas. Reminds me of Barcelona! You will love this place!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC. We went in for a bachelorette party and we were treated like queens. They randomly brought a free round of shots for us and then finished things off by giving all of us free dessert. They also put together and wrapped a gift for the bride to be and the items they gave her were expensive! The couple who owns the restaurant could not have been more warm and welcoming to all of us. In addition to the friendly atmosphere and great customer service, the food tasted extremely delicious and fresh. I would absolutely recommend eating here for any kind of event."}
{"text":"At the enthusiastic urging of our friends, we decided to give Bodega 13 a visit. So glad we did!

We were greeted warmly by the owner, Larry, who informed us about his plans for adding a fireplace wall on the back patio. I predict very shortly Bodega 13 will be the hangout for a lot of our friends. It has a fabulous atmosphere and the booths are comfy and spacious. 

Disclaimer: I LOVE tapas. Up until now, I haven't found any tapas bars 
in Scottsdale worth revisiting. Today that all changed, after ordering the tasty lobster bisque and the delicious honey lemon shrimp with grilled pineapple, spinach and crispy prosciutto. My partner ordered a burger on a pretzel roll, which was cooked to perfection. 

We can't wait to return. Love the layout, the beautiful decor, the lighting, and especially the service. Kudos to our server, Julian for making us feel right at home. 

Bodega 13 ... consider it your home away from home."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give them 5 Stars as the staff was friendly and we need more great restaurants in Carefree, but I can't (YET) for the following reasons:

I ordered a Margarita, and was told they had a blender. Server came back and said, \"No blender, can't make a frozen margarita\". Ok, they've only been open two weeks and their staff hasn't been trained yet, I can live without a frozen margarita. 

So I ordered a mojito, as mojitos are my favorite. When it was served, it looked good but unfortunately it was undrinkable. Without a doubt the worst mojito ever, and I can't even call it a mojito as it was so sour I had my server taste it so she could confirm.  I didn't order a remake as clearly the bartender does not know how to make a mojito. Again, maybe the bartender is still in training? 

Sent it back and ordered Santa Barbara Chardonnay. Excellent wine. Highly recommended. No training needed to pour wine into a glass!

On to the food: 
I specifically came for the lobster bisque. It was good as promised, with chunks of lobster meat. My partner ordered the minestrone. Very tasty. 

2nd course: beef tenderloin carpaccio with \"greens\". I had to do a double take as there was literally one teeny tiny piece of micro green (the size of a quarter) in the center of the plate as a decoration and no bread was offered OR served. HUGE disappointment. The meat was tender (no complaints there) but if the owner or chef is reading this review they need to visit The Scottsdale Quarter and order the beef carpaccio at Brio. I've NEVER tasted carpaccio as fabulous as Brio's and they serve it with parmesan toasts and plenty of greens, which is the way carpaccio should be served!

3rd course: tandoori chicken. 4 small pieces of chicken (2\" long) best described as tasteless. My first bite was crunchy and I thought for a minute that I was eating a shrimp, but then I realized it was RAW chicken so I quickly spit it out. However, the other 3 pieces were cooked through, so I did not complain.

My biggest complaint, which I DID mention to my server: the tables are too low. (At first I thought maybe the bench seat was the problem, but I also tried sitting in a chair and still the table was too low) Sitting for an hour was very uncomfortable. I was totally hunched over my food and someone needs to rectify this issue otherwise no one is going to want to sit downstairs. In fact, we were the only diners downstairs. Perhaps the upstairs bar and the high top tables on the patio are more comfortable?

Bottom line: we left hungry and disappointed. Because it is located next door to a cigar bar, the aroma of cigar smoke as you enter and exit is not an ideal situation. 

NOTE: we did not smell the cigar smoke downstairs but outside on the front and back patios you can definitely smell cigars. So if they don't raise the height of the tables so you can sit comfortably inside, then I don't know how they are going to make it. Tapas bars are tricky. When you are spending a lot of money for a little bit of food you need to have something special to lure customers in. The atmosphere is funky cool and the piped in music is retro fun but the food needs some work. Again, it's only been two weeks so I'm hopeful they will get the kinks worked out while I get the kinks worked out of my back from hunching over my food. LOL"}
{"text":"Great food, great service and atmosphere!  We can't wait to return!!! Definitely try this new local restaurant/wine bar out.  The chef is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious - many international options, authentic flavors. Loved the atmosphere. We rented the back room for a private event. The service was great. Cannot wait to check out the new patio!"}
{"text":"Thrilled that we discovered this restaurant! What a fabulous experience. The decor and atmosphere were relaxing-yet trendy. The service was impeccable. Mike, the server, was informative and attentive. The owners both came by to make sure that our meal met our expectations (it did- and then some!) Between the tapas appetizers that we shared (octopus and brussel sprouts among our favorites) to the entrees (paella- lamb chops-meatballs -trout) we are able to feel as though we were in other countries without leaving our booth! Custom cocktails were a nice accompaniment and the Tahitian pearl dessert worth the extra calories!! Definitely would recommend and can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I had the unfortunate circumstance of arriving here only a couple days after getting food poisoning on my way back to the US from Egypt, so I had a tender belly and this would be my first major meal. I took the leap and got the Trout entree and the smoked Scallops to share with my wife, and both dishes were fantastic. Deeply flavorful, with a balance of light and rich, creamy and crunchy, firm and soft, it was a wonderful meal to feel inspired to devour. I will definitely return here!"}
{"text":"I don't know where to start, decor was all over the place. I'm no interior designer but I counted 6 different types of lighting. Restaurant is less than a year old and chairs are \"aged\". I guess you'd have to see for yourself, there were some cool elements but nothing went together. Food wasn't anything to rave about, and I didn't see anything that I just had to go back for. Server was nice no issues or long waits as I saw in previous posts. I thought it was funny, the owners wife tried to be friendly, but every time I asked a question during conversation she ignored it and just said whatever she had to say. Not terrible but not my type of place, wish there were more tapas places in this area."}
{"text":"Somehow my previous review of this place disappeared? So to recreate a few of the things we ordered, lobster bisque promised pieces of lobster, I had one piece.  Stuffed dates, 5 to an order, they think it's, \"fun\" for you and your date to fight over the last one!  -That is what the waitress told us.  OK????
  The beef tenderloin?  3 bites worth?  Was it made of a royal cow for $14.00?  My guest wanted to stop at Wendy's on the ride home because he was still starving after $60+ in food.  I get the tapas thing, but we ordered enough not to be hungry when we left. Go for drinks, not the food."}
{"text":"You gotta go! This chic tapas wine place was a wonderful breath of fresh air for this Yelper! In the heat of the Arizona summer, I find it tough to eat an entire meal...but small plates?!?! I AM IN! As a gluten free girl, the options for tapas are more limited than I would like, but I will tell you the tomato basil soup and the Bodega salad I devoured created the most amazing combination that made me not long for flavor or substance. I may not have been able to share off the plates of my friends but they all wanted a taste of what I had! The chef cooked the food with lots of flavor, yet kept the dishes light to make everyone want more. The scallops came under glass with a beautifully aromatic smoky scent (and served with mashed potatoes....who doesn't LOVE these?!?). All the food was eaten and the group was happy!

I cannot express to you how amazing our server, Adrienne, was. Always approaching us with a warm and caring smile, she was the perfect ambassasor between our table experience and the kitchen/bar. My GF soup was accidently served with a crostini, but it was so awesome to see Adrienne take notice and go directly to speak to the chef about that...on my behalf. 

I have always said that the real test of a restaurant is not during a perfect meal, but instead how things are handled and I trust these.people to take great care in preparing food. After our delicious wine and amazing tapas in the beautiful surroundings, I cannot wait to go back. Emily and Larry are really interested in making sure your experience is the best and I appreciate that (we had a brief chat with good humored Larry and Emily came by to see how things were)! I cannot wait to go back and make this my usual place! The tables are generously spaced and it makes for an awesome atmosphere. There is also this great half moon table with fire as well as a great patio! Happy hour is throughout the restaurant! 

If you want to feel important, enjoy lots of various great foods without leaving stuffed, drink great wine, and feel pampered then go here! They were also doing a wine tasting for members of their NextDoor app friends. Great back room area for groups! Bravo!"}
{"text":"The good?  The food was delicious.  The bad? It's pretty spendy.  The lobster bisque was DELISH as was the smoked scallop under glass - but at $9 a pop, it'll leave you wanting.  Drinks were also tasty.  

Another reviewer mentioned the cigar smell and we noticed it too.  It is unfortunately pretty off-putting to smell that while you're eating.  I'm guessing eating outside might be better?"}
{"text":"Great food great service from Cesar. The paiya was excellent.  Larry also did a great job."}
{"text":"They can easily be a 5. The food was wonderful - that is a 5 - creative, tasty, good selection. The atmosphere is a 3.  The bar is great but it is very small and hard to get a seat at so you are then left with the back patio or basement - not a good vibe at all. They need to work with a good restaurant decorator to remodel so that is is good outdoor spot and doesn't feel like a cave or cold outdoor patio. If they can pull that off I will give them a 5. But great food and we will come back and try to get a bar seat next time."}
{"text":"Everything was wonderful - the hospitality - owner literally dragged us in from the street and are we ever glad he did!  All the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Great Service. Waiter was very friendly and gave us his top recommendations for tapas. The owner introduced herself and asked about our food.

Food was very good.  We watched the paella come out and it will be our next time must order."}
{"text":"I have to say that I have not been happier to write a follow-up review.  This is due in large part to the integrity demonstrated by Larry and Emily, the owners of Bodega 13. My wife and I had two occasions to dine at Bodega 13, the first being a positive experience and the second not, which I wrote about.  A few days later I received a call from Larry apologizing for the situation and inviting us for a do-over.  This took me by surprise since it was totally unexpected.  It is gratifying to encounter a restaurateur who takes accountability for and personal pride in his business--something that seems increasingly rare in this age of faceless corporate enterprises.  Larry explained that he considers himself part of the community and that it is his mission to provide a worthwhile experience to his neighbors.  My wife and I returned to Bodega 13 for our do-over on our weekly date night last week and it was clear that our previous negative dining experience was an anomaly.  We ordered the house sangria, hot and cold tapas, salads, and the seafood paella. We consider timing to be one of the critical elements of the service in a quality dining experience--enough time between dishes to savor them and enjoy a conversation rather than having orders stack up and rushing your meal, but not so much of a wait that you start drumming your fingers while satiety sets in.  Bodega 13's timing was impeccable. The second critical factor for us is, of course, the food itself.  The house red sangria was delicious, rich and fruity with a nice zing of brandy. I would urge anyone to try the bacon-wrapped dates.  We have had this type of dish at other tapas restaurants, but Bodega 13 does it best.  It is almost like having dessert first, but the sweetness is offset just enough by the unexpected touch of blue cheese. I also appreciate the fact that they chop the topping ingredients for their bruschetta so that I can take bites without having half of it land in my lap.  The salad ingredients were fresh and flavorful and the sizing quite generous for even the half salad order.  Finally, the paella, which had been wonderful the first time and problematic the second, was luscious once again.  The rice was moist yet fluffy and filled with generous portions of a variety of seafood--lobster meat, salmon, shrimp, mussels--all cooked to perfection.  It was more than the two of us could eat so we left with some to take home.  This wasn't just the case for us; we looked around at the paella being presented to other diners and observed the same dish being served.  Larry has said that he likes to serve his paella in the Spanish manner, but my wife has eaten paella in Barcelona and likes the Bodega 13 version better because she says the fish aren't looking back at her.  What Larry wasn't aware of is that I was so impressed by his personal call that shortly afterward I selected Bodega 13 as the place to meet a business colleague for a light meal and a drink.  I did not realize that my colleague was vegan but that was not a problem due to the variety of offerings available on Bodega 13's extensive tapas menu.  Bodega 13 did not disappoint and it will be my go-to place for business and, I am happy to report now, for future date-night dinners in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed lunch there   Will be going back. The burger was yummy and extremely rich tasting"}
{"text":"The environment is amazing! Very unique, pretty, clean, and fun. The food was spectacular. So many dishes that have amazing flavor! The specialty drinks were delicious too. I really enjoyed the experience and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The paella is so awesome! Such a unique menu, even for Scottsdale. The owners take a lot of pride and are very visible on the floor. And.... they have Graeter's ice cream!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service and a great wine & cocktail selection. The atmosphere is amazing and the staff is very friendly. In the past we've sat on the patio and it was very cool, especially when they had a guitarist playing on a Saturday night.

We ordered a number of tapas (I would highly recommend the stuffed dates and lollipop lamb & Thai curry chicken). As a craft beer snob my only knock on the place is that their beer selection is somewhat limited but that can be overlooked in light of the amazing wine selection. I'd also highly recommend the Tahitian Pearl for desert. It was amazing! 

This is one of the places we would love to take family & friends to when they visit us. I can't give a higher recommendation then that!"}
{"text":"My new best place in Scottsdale.  First time had good food and wine, but spotty service due to being understaffed on a Sunday evening.  Last night the place was well-staffed, served creative and tasty hot and cold tapas with very nice wine selections.
Cloth table coverings, nice stem wine glasses,conversation friendly as no other place has been.
Small bites well within budget."}
{"text":"I've been to Bodega 13 a few times for lunch and found the Tapas selection to be excellent.  The tacos, which are vegetarian right down to the jicama shell are surprisingly tasty, seasoned perfectly. My husband, never a veggie guy, loves them - feels like you're eating something substantial despite the small size.  The bacon wrapped blue cheese dates are very rich, but delicious, and the ceviche is one of our favorites, too!  Ladies, don't skip the white wine sangria for a refreshing, light drink. We are always treated well by a friendly waitress. Bring a good attitude and a little patience and you will enjoy yourself, completely.  I will say that two waitresses would be a benefit as the lunch crowd, approximately 6 tables on our last visit, tends to back up the wait time, but not too much to be a bother. What we really liked as natives here, was the fact that it was one of the very few places left that had not been discovered by the visitors in town, allowing a quieter, relaxed experience without some of the occasional demanding patrons. That said, it's a fantastic place to visit for very flavorful treats and yes, a bit slower pace - refreshing in a fast paced world.  Side note:  Please be sure to ask about the kid's menu available."}
{"text":"Awesome! My cheese plate was so delicious I started to cry. Everything I wanted and more. It came out with large delicious green grapes, my heart started to pitter patter. Thump thump. My heart is about to explode!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and owners are super nice and friendly. Great food. Enjoyed our lunch!  Super cool place."}
{"text":"Great birthday dinner! I loved the paella and stuffed dates. Also, a great wine selection!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday night. It was not too busy. The food and service was great. 
We had the seafood paellas, lamb pops, ceviche, marinated cucumbers, stuff dates, and more. Loved the variations of food. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic new upscale location.  The owners turned a great seafood kitchen into a first class tapas spot.  The kitchen wall was removed with a chef's table and bar facing very high end gourmet kitchen, wonderful booths and bar area, glass fireplace, small glass enclosed wine room with an excellent selection, great looking patio opening Oct 6th, and a private room seating 24.  Service was very attentive augmented by the owners personally welcoming and helping to serve.

Wonderful food, every one of the four tapas was super tasty and prepared just right.  Spanish stuffed dates, Spanish honey shrimp, French scallops under glass and Russian dumpling.  Four were perfect for two people. All topped off by an excellent Malbec. Half the price of the steak house next door and much better food!

Will definitely be back soon to try the entrees and the paellas!! And for lunch!

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've reviewed this restaurant and want to offer my condolences to the owner for improving his portions compared to the prices.  I ordered the $23 Schnitzel and it was not only \"off the hook\" delicious, but a huge portion that I couldn't finish.  I chose the mashed potato option with the brown mushroom gravy.  Excellent correction Larry - thank you and we will be back! 

PS - Their cocktail prices are very fair."}
{"text":"Super yum! The food was excellent, the presentation was gorgeous, the restaurant has the best decor and a great ambiance. I love tapas and they had delicious vegetarian
 options. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Really terrific food. Great waiters... nice ambiance. Food great.  They had a location in Carefree but more to Pinnacle Peak.  No problem... for us, we'll be seeing them again."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. The patio is a great place to enjoy some Paella  and a glass of Red. Owners are very nice, friendly and social. Service is a little slow though."}
{"text":"Five stars for this restaurant! When we walked through the doors we were greeted by one of the owners who seemed to really take a great pride in this restaurant. I got the meat lovers entree and it was amazing!! Lots of flavor. They had great wine selections as well. 

Thank you for the great experience Bodega 13! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We were a group of 5. We tried the tenderloin & asparagus, the duck tacos, the lamb lollys, the cerviche, the veggie, & olive plates.  Everything was beautiful and tasty.  The restaurant has a nice wine menu and interesting (fun)  adult libations. We sat on the patio and had a friendly, knowledgeable, and good waitress.  The sizes & prices are just tight.  You should check this place out."}
{"text":"Loved their foods, service and ambient! The entire restaurant is a delightful surprise.  Generous portion for tapas! Only tried 5 dishes yesterday so we are going back there for more pleasant adventures!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this new place in the neighborhood. We understand the concept of Tapas restaurant, small plates to share and enjoy as they come right out of the kitchen. 
But what a disappointment, tiny portions of very mediocre food at high prices does not leave a good first impression. 
The place is nicely decorated and the wait staff are friendly but unfortunately that's the only reason for not giving Bodega 13  only one star. There are many other choices  
to dine in far North Scottsdale that deserve your consideration, but the one is off our list."}
{"text":"Longing for a return to our trip to Spain we decided to look for a tapas restaurant. And we hit the jackpot. Bodega 13 is so adorable. Went for lunch on a rainy day and had great food in an equally great setting. 

I had the Tapas box which included soup or salad and your choice of 2 tapas for $19. I had the blue cheese stuffed dates and the shrimp and chorizo. I really wanted some grilled cheese to go with my soup choice (tomato bisque) so they added one to my order for only $3. That grilled cheese was well worth the add. 

Hubby had the Cubano sandwich and shared part of mine and is happy to have half his sandwich to enjoy later. 

Our waitress was great. She told us that they have paella night on Tuesdays and you can get half price bottles of wine during that. Looks like paella Tuesday is in the near future! 

Can't wait to go back!  They have a chefs table that looks like it would be an amazing experience too!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the beer and skipped the paella promo. The owner was pleasant and the chicken kabobs with peanut sauce left me licking my fingers!"}
{"text":"Bodega 13 is no longer at this Carefree location! (please disregard the Star rating -- we didn't get to eat here because they have moved.)"}
{"text":"Wow! What a great experience. My family and I came here for my birthday and had a marvelous time. The decor was cozy and we loved the jazz playing throughout the night. After we sat, we chose a lovely wine from the extensive wine list and started deciding what to get. We decided to go for family style, sharing the tapas and small plates. 

The marinated olives had great seasoning and were easy to share. The stuffed dates were as well. We ordered the mussels. This is a must get and must share! There were a lot of mussels in the bowl and the broth was rich. I like that they also gave us some bread to soak it up. 

The duck tacos were a nice kick but hard to share (keep them to yourself ;) ) and the lamp lollipops were hard to share because they were so good! They were ordered medium and came out cooked to perfection. Chicken tandori was also wonderful - we ordered twice. Great sauce to pair. 

My mom who was dietary issues ordered the salmon salad - surprised on the portion but wow! The dressing was subtle yet so good. The salmon perfectly seasoned as well. The tomatoes were an awesome bit of acid

Honorable mention to the tuna tetaki with amazing wasabi potato salad. It was a perfect pairing. 

Our server was so helpful and friendly. She even brought us a free duck taco! It was an awesome experience and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went there last night with a group of ladies, it was 1/2 off Tapas night.  Restaurant was busy and they were not prepared for a crowd, they were out of 1/4 of the tapas items (at 6:30 and they aren't open for lunch). Service was horrendous.  They served one plate and waited over a 1/2 hour to serve another and then another 10 minutes for another.  They didn't even serve one order claiming they \"forgot\" it.  Other tables who came after us were served well before our food came, were we discriminated against because we were women?   Food quality that they did serve was poor.  We won't be back and would never recommend this restaurant to anyone.  I would give them negative stars if I could.  Bull shit to Larry's comments, there was no torrential downpour.  This guy is a liar!  Restaurant sucks!"}
{"text":"Bodega restaurant had a delightful ambiance to the restaurant. Delicious food, especially the paella entrees and wonderful service. Highly recommend for private parties as well."}
{"text":"This was a sad experience, to say the least. I took my mother there for lunch and we walked in with an open mind.

We ordered two French hamburgers which featured brie and a very dry amount of duck confit. Sure the Hamburger came with a French flag on it and it was a \"nice touch\". It reminded me of the scene in National Lampoon's European Vacation where the restaurant in Paris serves plates of pre-made food topped by a French flag.

This was followed by a raw tuna poke (poisson cru) while the description on the menu looked promising, all the flavors we were expecting had either evaporated from the kitchen to our table or there is a flavor vortex which must suck out all flavors.

The food served was utterly devoid of flavors and it is amazing they get anybody at all.

I will never set food in this place again."}
{"text":"Yea tapas in the neighborhood! Finally a restaurant that isn't bar food, pizza, or $$$! Good wine, good food."}
{"text":"Stopped in late for a salad and glass of wine. Had a great experience. Loved talking with Emily! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"What an amazing Tapas experience.  We tried several of the standards...Honey Walnut Shrimp, Seared Pork Belly, Beef Tenderloin, Shrimp Ceviche, and Marinated Cucumbers. The highlight was Scallops Under Glass...a glass dome infused with hickory smoke...delicious! As for dessert the Tahitian Pearl is out of this world!  When the hot caramel sauce cracks through the chocolate shell vanilla ice cream it's amazing. The owners Larry and Emily stopped by to say hello!  What a great place! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came in here after seeing a flyer in the neighborhood. Completely disappointed. Came hungry and left hungry after a $16 lunch. Three meatballs that were mushy, tomatoes soup cup was tiny and spicy and olives and one piece of toast. Hubby got a shrimp tapas with three shrimp and two slivers of pineapple for $13. 

I would have looked past the prices maybe if the food was amazing. But the service was very poor. Why do people work in a bar but act as if they don't like people? Very short attitude and unfriendly. When I asked a question it was as if I was bothering her. 

Not coming back. Save your money."}
{"text":"What a gem!!!  I wish I could give them 10 stars!  My second time eating here this week (Lunch and Dinner) and tomorrow will be the third!  Every menu item has been magnificent and thoroughly enjoyed, particularly the bacon wrapped dates with blue cheese crumbles and for dessert?  None other than The Tahitian Pearl!  The menu is all-inclusive, and boasts a nice variety for even the pickiest of diners!  The owner occasionally walks around to display other dishes so you can take a peek!  How entertaining is that?  

The restaurant is decorated beautifully, booths and tables, as well as outside dining, including a gorgeous wine display, walk-in wine cellar and full bar.  Noise level is great--you can actually hear and carry on a conversation with the people you are dining with!  Imagine that!  Even the bathrooms are tastefully decorated with lovely soap and lotion - and the trash is conveniently placed near the door!  Now THAT's attention to detail!  I'm looking forward to trying more menu items and being a regular here!  

Run, don't walk to Bodega 13!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Scottsdale for a bachelorette party. The only place that called us back for a reservation of more than 10 people. The best experience I have ever had. We walked in and they were immediately excited about us being there and made us feel more than welcome! They even bought our bride a cute gift and made sure our experience was amazing. Not only was the hospitality the best I have ever experienced, the food was amazing. We tried almost everything on the menu with a huge group and not one complaint! They even brought us this amazing apple Dutch desert on the house, what restaurant does that now a days? If you ever come to this area, make sure you spend a night here!! Great people and great food!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful facility, fantastic food, great service  Had the pleasure of dinning there last night with a group of friends.  Ordered the seafood paella for the table to share as well as a variety of tapas. Our server (Jonathon) was quite knowledgeable, and personable, and the owners a delight to speak with -- the people are genuine, \"get it\" and do things right just because it's the right thing to do.  A little bit goes a long way here, so the price is quite affordable for the quality of food.  And as an added bonus, if you're a Scotch fan, the selection is outstanding."}
{"text":"Excellent!  We had one shared plate (chicken skewers) and three tapas (tuna, duck tacos and a shrimp dish).  All were very good.  All priced between $9 and $11.  Service was very good also.  Only small issue was with one of the specialty cocktails.  I think it was called the Queen Mother and is was described as London Dry gin and dry vermouth.  It came out red!?  Maybe they meant sweet vermouth but I was expecting a regular gin martini.  They brought me one of those when I questioned the first drink so no problem."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and my husband and I were happy to stumble upon this restaurant while on vacation. The dates and pork schnitzel were the best!! Not to mention the scallops under glass and the duck tacos. We topped it off with the Tahitian Pearl dessert! This place is a must try."}
{"text":"Went to night and found a Mardi Gras special. Etoufee, jambalaya and hurricanes. Jamba was the best I've had outside of Louisiana! Go before it's all gone."}
{"text":"Great tasting food in a neat space. The bacon wrapped dates are fantastic! Best thing is you can order a few things to try and not feel gorged. Definitely will be coming back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"My daughter and my husband and i were heading for the restaurant  in the same area and we saw Bodega 13 and decided to try it out. Boy! are we glad we did!!  We were greeted  by a very delightful lady who we found out later is co-owner along with her husband. My husband was undecided about which beer to order when the owner suggested he have a sample of his own favorite. My husband loved the sample, ordered a tall one and now has a new favorite beer! the food we ordered, 4 different tapas, were all outstanding and delicious. The chicken sate reminded us of the recipe we loved while living in Holland. The decor is very chic, and also reminded us of our time spent in Europe. patio will open in Sept. with music and special parties. Can't wait to go back for dinner soon. We are so excited there is a place so lovely, so close, and with a fabulous menu to boot!

Dave and Diana R. Phoenix"}
{"text":"Love this gem! Larry and Emily are welcoming and the atmosphere beautiful and inviting.  The food is fabulous! Wonderful variety ... tapas from around the globe.  A truly eclectic and delicious experience!  Can't wit until \"patio season\"!  So happy to have this wonderful family owned spot in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited on the very busy Valentine's evening, the staff, and especially the bartender, Jason, handled the chaos with aplomb. The tapas menu has a good representation of many different country's cuisine. The atmosphere is very pleasant, bordering on the romantic. Also, a very nice wine selection to choose from, wide, not necessarily deep. But they serve a nice Sancere, so we were pleased! 
We returned for a late lunch a couple of weeks later and had another great meal. We will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"Wait staff ok.  Lady ran up and down the stairs at least 50 times.  Felt bad.  We brought our portable electron micro scope in to the restaurant but we still couldn't find the scallop under the dome of death. Just kidding. We found it but we didn't die.  The meatballs were crostiniless despite promises to the contrary and were dry. Muscles existed and there was an effort. The four honey-shrimp were over-cooked but edible.  The beef tenderloin was good. The stuffed dates arrived and the sun came out, the sky parted and the villagers rejoiced.  The Creme Broule was a bit thin for a 9 dollar cup of sugary custard.  Let's have some torch action up in this baby.  Don't be afraid.  

To conclude . . .   Nah.  

Dairy Queen has a great Brazier Burger and they are less than a mile away.   


Seriously though, if you value money don't go here."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise and evening. We decided to give this restaurant a try. This is the third night since it's opening and all I can say is WOW. The food was amazing. We tried 5 different items (it is a tapas bar) on the menu and each one was superb.   Duck tacos, chicken skewers, tuna tetaki, lamb lollipops (2 orders.....they were that good), lobster bisque (wish it had a bit more cream in it) . It is difficult to pick a favorite because each was excellent. Love the wine choices we made too. We just moved to Carefree and we will go to Bodega 13 often."}
{"text":"i live in the area this is one of the more outstanding restaurants. I like the variety on the menu and the quality has never disappointed me.  Everyone talks about the unique dessert called the Pearl.  Don't leave until you try it!  I am hooked..."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to the former Cellar 13.  I didn't so much notice a change upstairs, but downstairs the cozy lounge ambiance is gone.  The new space has tables and chairs and some banquette seating---there's a fair amount of space running down the middle, so it didn't feel snuggly at all.  Because it was nippy and---to us---the music on the outdoor patio was loud, we chose to eat at one of those small tables.  There was a goodly crowd outside and about a third of the table downstairs were filled.

Service was quite good.  Food was okay.  In no particular order, we had: vegetable taco, scallop under glass, shrimp and chorizo, tuna tetaki, and stuffed dates.  DH was drinking the Jade Mountain Merlot (they only offered one merlot by the glass) and I had the Edna Valley Pinot Noir.  

The stuffed date was a POW of flavor.  We could have eaten a dozen of these.  The scallop under glass (mind you, ONE scallop) was tasty, but was presented too quickly.  Our server whisked off the glass cloche and the smoke dissipated before we could get a good sniff although there was a faint smokiness to the perfectly cooked scallop.  The tuna tetaki was perfectly seared.  Basically, we found everything to be tasty, but for the dates, sadly under-seasoned.  (However, we have found this true of many restaurants in Carefree---they must ban salt at the town border!).  DH finally did ask for and get a salt shaker.  

So, we would return (although DH says we are bringing our salt grinder with us!), but we aren't going to fall over ourselves to do so.  It's a good fall back for when we want something tasty and don't want to travel too far or be in the mix at a large eatery.  It is a bit on the costy side---we each had one glass of wine and our tab was $78.00.  I do miss relaxing back in a comfy chair and nibbling and drinking, but I guess that didn't work or Cellar 13 wouldn't have gone away."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever, and it was Saturday afternoon with barely any customers there. Average burgers that took forever to get to us."}
{"text":"We had a party of four people and the tapas concept was a new adventure for some of our group. The spanish chorizo and shrimp tapa was ordered by one party member while the rest of us shared a small caesar, chicken curry tapa, smoked scallops tapa and a pork schnitzel entree. 

Our waiter Barry, recommended the tapas and was willing to accommodate what we were sharing and not sharing. It worked out wonderfully. 

The caesar dressing was tangy and delicious. The sauce in the chicken curry had a ginger peanut combination which surprisenly complemented each other and the chicken was tender and juicy. The brie lended a salty goodness and creaminess to the scallops and potato. The scallops were seared perfectly. The gravy on the pork schnitzel was flavorful, the potatos cooked just right and the red cabbage side was not too sweet and enhanced the pork.

We decided to try the restaurant as part of the Arizona Restaurant Gift card we purchased at Costco. We had just watched a game at Scottsdale Stadium and the restaurant was a bit of a drive but well worth the effort. Be careful, there is a photo enforced speed trap on the way there so go 45 MPH.

We were lucky to get a table without reservations because we arrived early. By the time we left, the restaurant was packed. Our waiter was attentive and service was efficient. We were able to talk to both owners and they were delightful. It is not often we go to restaurants where the owners are an integral part of the operations.

I wished we live in the area because this restaurant would be a regular alternative."}
{"text":"Hidden treasure in our quaint neighborhood, which has limited unique dining options. Ambiance, service and food - A+++.  Lauren provided excellent service, owners Larry & Emily were energetic and welcoming.  Wonderful experience, will be back for more.  Thank you & cheers!  Casee, Jcrew, and soon Eric (OH-IO)"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. I did. The menu looked outstanding but it just under delivered. 

Our server was a doll, super sweet. Nice atmosphere. 
We ordered some tapas and drinks...the dishes were very hit or miss. 
A few came out cold despite the restaurant being almost empty.  One was so over salted I could barely eat it. At this price point all the dishes should be a home run but these unfortunately were not.  They got a lot right (service, menu, atmosphere) but they didn't get the most important part- executing the dishes-right.  I can't say we will return any time soon."}
{"text":"It's a beautiful restaurant inside and we have absolutely no complaints about the staff. Our server and one of the chefs we spoke with were very friendly. We ordered Paella, and while it was good, the price seems a little steep for a dish that consists mainly of rice. I get it though; it's in a high-end area, rent probably isn't cheap, and it offers a romantic European-inspired setting. This is a place you would take your significant other to for a special occasion. Try to get the fire table if you do (not real flames)."}
{"text":"What a great spot! The owners are on premises to make sure everything is spot-on & it is!  Austin, our bartender took excellent care of us, timing our tapas selections perfectly.  We ate lamb chops, dates wrapped in bacon, a scallop under glass, meatball...all off the tapas menu.  Loved every bite & we will be back!"}
{"text":"Very engaging service! Menu is very diverse and what we had was very good! They didn't start out so great when they opened but now they are pretty darned good."}
{"text":"Would not recommend ordering lunch to go. Greasy grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup was just OK. Our whole office ordered lunch, the usually delicious lobster bisque had a real bad fishy smell and not good at all. Overall consensus not a good experience so sad my birthday lunch ended up with such unacceptable food."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! Exceptional quality of food! By far my favorite restaurant in N. Scottsdale with the coolest atmosphere inside. I've eaten here 3 times and have loved each experience. We had the seafood paella last night which was out of this world. The meat paellas are excellent too! They're HUGE & served in a cast iron bowl and brought to the table roasting hot with a tall piece of burning rosemary on top... cool presentation! I've also tried plenty of their tapas, and they're all great! The seared tuna entre is another fav of ours. So fresh & a healthy option.They have an excellent wine selection & an off the charts cocktail called the Pain Killer! We ended the night with their well known Tahitian Pearl dessert which is probably the MOST DELICIOUS dessert we've ever tasted! Friendly staff greet you from the moment you step in and make you feel right at home. This place is a hidden gem located just across from the Mastros entrance. You definitely should give it a try in lieu of Mastros as the quality of food is on par yet the prices are far more reasonable...and it's hip inside with good mood lighting so you can see where you're going! ;-) Their bar area is really nice & cozy and a great place to grab a HH drink. I guarantee you'll end up staying to dine once you look at their menu though. You won't regret giving this place a try. Love that far N. Scottsdale has a super cool place like this in the area...finally!!!"}
{"text":"The name alone gets 5 stars. It's a NYC thang.... We had  dinner with friends here and I was surprised by this beautiful treasure tucked in the Pinnacle Peak area right next door to Mastro's.  

We walked into a private room with a huge television on the wall.  The owner Larry explained to us the reason he gave the restaurant it's name. Larry and his wife traveled all over the world and decided to bring these taste back to Scottsdale.  

After that story, I'm ready to eat. I ordered the salmon with fresh vegetable. My hubby ordered the same. I'm ready to eat.... 

The salmon looked amazing, and when I placed my fork into it.....wow, it felt like melted butter. The taste was even better.  

As I finished my salmon, the chef walked in and asked us \"How was the food, and if we needed anything\"?  This place is magical. I mean the chef came from his kitchen cave to talk with us....  

This place is a diamond in the rough. 

Larry has an exceptional warmth about him.  He takes pride in his establishment and it shows.  Try this place, you wouldn't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow! What a gem of a restaurant. Excellence from beginning to end. Offers an eclectic selection of international tapas including very inventive, detailed dishes with a creative use of flavors and textures  throughout. Delicious wine list. Intimate yet lively ambiance. Polished but friendly and attentive service provided by an exceptionally knowledgeable and enthusiastic staff. Truly impressive. From now on this will be a must when visiting Scottsdale. The new Bodega 13 is simply world class. Thank you again to the owners Larry and Emily for an outstanding dining experience!"}
{"text":"The back patio is like a private Spanish courtyard. Service outstanding (owner is very personable). The chef is German and has won awards for several of his dishes. Duck taco ,lobster bisque, Seafood paella all amazing. Pomegranates on the duck taco were delightful. An excellent example of the chef's genius in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Like traveling around the world and back, all in one meal! Absolutely delicious. Great local vibes. Passionate owners who want to create a special place for locals and out of town guests, too. A must visit. The patio vibes with live music are tops!"}
{"text":"I have never been here for their tapas, although heard it is good. Actually went there today for their Mother's Day Brunch. Oh man. Gross. They don't know how to treat a mom! It was like they went to Costco and bought a bunch of salty meat, cheese, and starchy sides in bulk and threw it together on a buffet. Their website indicates they would have an omelet bar (which was scrambled eggs) and a dessert bar (which was 2 different types of danishes). 

The selection was lousy and small. I don't love meat but I tried their turkey which was fair. I tried their mixed greens, also fair. And their sauteed vegetables which was carrots, red pepper, onion and celery. Really??! They couldn't throw in a brussel sprout or broccoli or something? Two veggie selections and no fish. 
 

If you're all about the meat and potato guy, I'm sure it made dad happy but even my husband  thought the food was below mediocre. We paid 39.99 per adult which seems overpaying for something that didn't look like it required a lot of effort. 

Forget ending on a sweet note. Dessert was like some sort of pastry you could buy in a box at Costco. Store bought Entemann's danish?? Anyone? No chocolate, no nothing. I wouldn't exactly call it a \"dessert bar\". 

It's not really fair to give a one star review when I have never tried their tapas but I wouldn't recommend going there for Mother's Day Brunch and I was so turned off by this experience, not sure I'd give it another try."}
{"text":"We have eaten at the restaurant four or five times and always found the food to be delicious and beautifully presented. We had family Mother's Day brunch at the restaurant today. The buffet was over priced and extremely disappointing. For $40 a person we expected something more interesting, appealing to look at and of better quality. So much of the food was white and starchy. There was nothing we couldn't have gotten at a chain or a diner for far less money. Please don't bother to do this if you don't intend do it well."}
{"text":"Great food and service!!! The owners were very nice. The restaurant has good ambience. Will definitely come back here!!!"}
{"text":"I was craving seafood paellas.  Craving was satisfied!  It took about 30 minutes but it was worth the wait.  I look forward to trying their other paellas next time with chorizo or steak.  Also tried the duck tacos (using jicama instead of tortillas) and the lamb lollipops.  Both delicious.  Lamb was a bit over cooked but it was still yummy.  They had live music on Friday evening in the back patio.  Nice and relaxing.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow. What a great little find.  Drive on up to carefree and try a bit of Paradise.  The service was amazing!  Food .. To die for.  Don't even get me started about the beautiful ambience!  Check this place out ! It's MEWOW"}
{"text":"The tapas here are very eclectic and very delicious. The restaurant itself is very classy and warm. Staff and ownership are top notch. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone.  We took the whole family there for Mother's Day brunch, which was advertised to have carving stations, breakfast buffet, dessert table and more!  I could of taken my money and stayed all night at the Holiday Inn and ate the free breakfast Buffet and had much better food and presentation.  The food looked and taste like it came from Costco.  It was a complete waste of my time and money."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy wine, beer and food from all over the world.  Amazed at the many beers on tap.  Good choice of wines too.  Some days half off on bottles of wine.
Yesterday we had the shared plates of filet and asparagus, the dates stuffed with blue cheese (they are the best),meat balls, and on the vegetarian side our guest had the veggie tacos, Grilled vegetables.  The tacos are a little small to share but very good, vegetables were fresh and grilled perfectly.  We set outside in a small but shaded area.  They mentioned a planned expansion of outside eating in the fall.  This was just what we were looking for after a busy day showing our out of town guest Scottsdale etc."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with great recipes from around the world. Fantastic Seafood paella that serves 2-3, tender and tasty schnitzel and trout. Great looking desserts. Too full this time to try."}
{"text":"We ended up running into this place tonight because another restaurant we had stopped at was absolutely rude and awful, so we left and found Bodega 13! It was fabulous! We had our 3 daughters with us, I loved the tapas style food. Everything we ordered was yummy! The service was exceptional. The wine was fantastic! Totally recommend the food, service & atmosphere in this place. Will most certainly be back!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and awesome food.  Live music on some nights just adds to the atmosphere.  Wes was a great server and really nice guy.  I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for New Years Day lunch.  Everything was awesome: food, wine, service. Cesar made the experience awesome.  Husband and I both had the tapas box.  Shrimp, meatballs, salad, lobster bisque all fantastic.  Kids had the burgers and fried and loved them.  We will definitely be back for dinner so we can try the paella!!"}
{"text":"It was really disappointing! We thought there's finally a good Tapas restaurant on our side of town. Everything was either tasteless or distasteful including the sangria. I must say that the one redeeming entry on the menu was the chocolate covered ice cream for dessert and that was it. Nothing spectacular. Nothing even close to real Spanish food taste. Plus running out of a lot of commonly asked for entrees like salmon is not acceptable. Maybe if it is really something rare and exotic but salmon?"}
{"text":"Horrible service and even worse food. So excited to leave and never come back that I couldn't even complain. 

Entrees were inedible. 

Buyer beware. Stay away."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim after stopping next door for cigars. Decided to celebrate my birthday and ordered the mussels, bacon wrapped dates, carpaccio and a bottle of Smashberry wine. All delicious. The mussels were excellent and fat in a nice sauce. Loved the Smashberry vintage. Just wish there were more of the dates! :)

Then the Seafood Paella arrived complete with smoking sage! Really good with big chunks of lobster, mahi-mahi and shrimp. Delicious!

We loved the old Cellar 13 and missed it a great deal. So happy the location is open and serving up wine and tapas next to the Maduro cigar shop!"}
{"text":"This was a wonderful experience. 5-star food (lobster bisque was the favorite of all) and an interesting environment. There was a nice bar, a chef's table, cozy downstairs main dining area and a nice outdoor area where we ate. The staff was nice and accommodating. We had the best waiter ever (6-stars). They are opening up a new place with an even more exciting menu. I look forward to that. I hope that it has space to kick back and enjoy time with friends. Only negative was the music which detracted from the relaxed atmosphere of the food and decor. We understand they have relaxing live music outside on Friday and Saturday.

This will be a new regular place to eat or drink."}
{"text":"This is our second visit.  Nice decor and good service. First time we went for lunch and the menu didn't have the Paella that we thought of getting until dinner.  So we came back.  We started out with the grilled Romaine salad which was tasty but I wouldn't order it again. We ordered the seafood paella which was more than enough for 2 to share.  It was flavorful with a nice selection of fish and seafood but the rice was a bit dry and it was black and crusted on the bottom of the pan. Other items on the menu looked interesting but not sure we will go for a third time."}
{"text":"Mothers Day Dinner was a success. Chef Juan knocked it out of the park with his signature paella and surf N turf dishes. Appetizers were quick and cooked to perfection. The octopus was just right and the clams too.

Cesar, our waiter was very personable and helpful in decision making for menu/wine items.

The owner, conversed with us and made us feel welcome.

Highly recommend Bodega 13!"}
{"text":"We had dinner last night with friends that have never experienced Bodega 13, they are Traveler's from all over the world. The service was spot on and the Tapas were incredible! We enjoyed the fire table which enhanced the ambience which was already beautiful. The Chef's were very creative with their food and the Owner's Larry and Emily were very welcoming and made sure we had a great experience. I would highly recommend Bodega 13 for those who have not given it a try. Favorites were Smoke glass scallops, honey shrimp, stuffed dates, chorizo shrimp, chicken piccata and all their salads were amazing! The outside patio with live music ended our evening with a night cap and very relaxing atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Ordered an entree Salad of the size of a scoop of ice cream for nine dollars.I would not suggest coming here if you are hungry and the service was not the greatest and we were the only people eating there. This place is brand-new. If they continue this way they will never make it."}
{"text":"If you haven't discovered this treasure of a restaurant yet, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!?? Lunch, dinner, happy hour - doesn't matter what you're in the mood for, you will be blown away by the gorgeous decor and atmosphere, the friendly and attentive staff and the stellar quality food. Whether you eat outside on the shady patio, in the private banquet room, in a cozy booth or at the chef's table it'll be a great experience.  

The menu is fresh and unique - unlike the standard fare you'll find at almost every other establishment.  On the menu next to each dish is the country where it originates.  The variety is impressive but the quality of the food is what keeps us coming back.  The food is healthy, fresh and they can accommodate ANY diet restriction. My husband is limited in what he can eat anywhere else since he has to avoid gluten, dairy, eggs, almonds and refined sugar.  He has had unbelievably delicious meals each time he has been to Bodega.  Take it from me, you WON'T be disappointed!! Larry and Emily, the owners, are the sweetest couple and have worked hard to make their restaurant a place you'll want to come back to and bring guests with again and again! Don't walk, RUN over there!!"}
{"text":"As year round residents, we are looking for go-to spots for us and looking to support local businesses.  Unfortunately, this was not one of them due to the service.  Now the restaurant only had 4 table filled but some how our waitress managed to appear as if the restaurant was packed.  Finally the bar tender came over and rescued us.  And he was great.

The food was good from that point on but based on several of our other yr round friends who have tried Bodaga 13 a few time, the personal reviews have not been good.  Again, poor service and differing reports of smaller portions and quality of food.  

Not sure about you, but I sure get tired of restaurants not paying attention to their wait staff's attention to their customers !!!!!

So, take it from people who live here yr round of snow bird - which ever.

We really wish we had another great local business we could go week after week.  Oh well."}
{"text":"Came In to eat and it was not the best. Food was ok ,service was ok . Then this girl came up to the table I think her name was Rachel and made us feel very welcome and knew what she was doing. Made my wife and I night ! We will be coming back to see her."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place.  Server was very friendly, but very slow (and the restaurant was empty).  Some of the food items were wonderful (lamb, stuffed dates), some were so-so, and some were not very good at all.  We'll probably try coming here again, but certainly in no rush to do so."}
{"text":"Not a bad thing on the menu! The lamb lollipops and duck tacos were the best!! and every staff member kind and attentive."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with our dinner. Food was OK, but service was terrible.  Long wait for food, first course served at different times.  Long wait on dinner, waiter almost never stopped by table, at end after he cleared plates he came with the bill.  Never offered dessert, coffee, anything.   Interesting part owners knew of the issue, at least it seemed so, but never stopped by our table.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Well... We would like to say 4.5 but can't.  We are very finicky with our Spanish Tapas so they had a high bar to hit. 

Starters:  Caesar Salad, Lobster Bisque, Stuffed Dates and Scallop under glass. Good was the salad and soup.  They were not bad but just good.  I LOVE LOVE me stuffed dates.  These had a little too much blue cheese for my liking and not enough wine reduction sauce which was very good.  Now, I am not a big seafood person but WOW WOW WOW for the Scallop under glass. They smoke it with Applewood and add crab, truffle butter and lobster. It was a fantastic flavor. Must try this when you come! This was easily the star of the show!

Main dish: we tried the Chicken and Chorizo Paella.  It was very good and just spicy enough. If we had to change one thing about it, we'd substitute dry cured Spanish Chorizo for the loose chorizo, but this was still really good. 

Will be back for sure very soon!!!  You will not disappointed if you like traditional Spanish and international tapas."}
{"text":"Not sure I agree with the owner's comments to my review.
First, I don't believe it is my responsibility to say something.  I know this is a common theme among restaurant owners, but I take a different position.  I certainly would not enjoy telling someone how bad the food or service is or was and I don't believe it is my job as the customer to be your quality control. That is your job but it would seem that you would rather blame the reviewer.  There are multiple avenues for the consumer to help them determine their dining choices and I believe this is a good thing.  Personally, I like using services like Yelp, but I read the reviews carefully and try not to get swayed by those that are clearly determined to hurt someone rather than offer an honest opinion.

Second, I notice in your reply you never addressed the quality of the food or why your bartended poured two consecutive flat beers.  Interesting.

Finally, your comment that I \"ran\" to Yelp, implies you are growing impatient and tired of these bad reviews.  I'm sure it would wear on me as well, but I doubt I would blame the reviewer.
I wish you good luck."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently found out about this gem of a restaurant and really enjoyed our first of many meals here. Tasty food, original and unique menu, great service, and beautiful ambiance."}
{"text":"Bodega 13 is a new hidden gem...it's quaint and warm. Depending upon the night they have live music. The food is consistently good and wine list is great. Some items are a bit over-priced.  The wait staff are friendly and attentive. We have been 4 times now and will continue!"}
{"text":"My husband and I loved our first tapas experience at Botega 13! The staff are very warm and knowledgeable. The menu is internationally diverse and enticing. The wine list has a solid selection of choice to accompany their inspired dishes. We thoroughly enjoyed our tapas choices starting with a very fresh \"Seafood Martini\". The vegetable tacos with jicama \"tortilla\" is a tasty treat and great option for those avoiding gluten. We finished with meatballs and savored every delicious bite! We will be back - often!"}
{"text":"While we realize that we made a reservation on Christmas and perhaps they were understaffed, they still took the reservation on Open Table. We were shocked at how the hostess/owner/manager(?) handled our reservation. First we waited at the door for at least 5 minutes. Then when she finally figured out where to seat us (she said they were just so slammed, despite the restaurant having several open tables- apparently this place just doesn't fill up), she did tell us 'I don't know who your server will be but I will come by and bring you water and get your drinks out'. Fast forward to 15 minutes- no one came to our table. The hostess/owner/manager (?) was busy slowly cleaning a table across the restaurant. We decided this was not going to be a good night. As we started to walk out, she literally ran into us. We said, 'we are sorry but we are going to have to leave- no one ever came to our table and perhaps you are just too overwhelmed tonight'. She did not apologize at all but said 'Yes, we are. Come back another night.' That was it. no incentive to dine there again with an apology- just happy to see us leave. And I should point out that we have eaten there before and thought it was ok. We thought we would give it another shot but now we realize why our friends have wrinkled their noses when we suggested going here. Final insult- they marked our reservation as cancelled on Open Table- even though we not only checked in but were there getting zero service for at least 20 minutes. We went across the way to Mastro's and had a phenomenal dinner with the excellent service they always provide. Hint: Pay attention to how other restaurants treat their customers and don't ignore them when you have clearly messed up."}
{"text":"I hate to leave a bad review because it has nothing to do with the food.  The food was great.  The place is super cool and I really enjoyed it. Although, its over priced and the portions are small-- but thats Scottsdale for you.  I enjoyed it so much that I decided to make a reservation for Valentine's day back in January.  Today (Feb 2) I get a call from then telling me that they are offering only a $100 per person fixed menu on Valentines day.  This really upset me for several reasons.  #1- This was NOT STATED when I made the reservation.  They manager claimed it due to \"technical problems\" with open table, but every other place that did this had it listed very clearly.  #2- He waited until today, 2 weeks notice and I cant get a single reservation anywhere else decent.  I asked, \"Since you know this is a problem and you have to call people, why not simply offer your normal menu as well?\"  He just said basically they're not going to do it.  Now, I might consider doing it although I think $100 a person is steep without wine, I have many food allergies so often with a set menu, I can't eat half the things on it.

So, sadly, a spot with potential but they ruined my Valentine's day plans-- and now I look like a moron that didn't take the time to make a reservation in advance, which is exactly what I did.  I doubt they will remain in business if they continue to run like this.   Oh, I forgot to mention, the wine poor was TINY."}
{"text":"Overall, the food was unique and delicious.  One dish came out cold and another had to be re-vamped because they were out 4 of 6 ingredients.  Service was slow but the owners Larry and Emily were very friendly.  The Scallops Under Glass were amazing as was the desert Tahitian Pearl.  Even with the issues, we would definitely give it another try!!"}
{"text":"What a gem!  Seriously the best paella I have ever had.  We had the meat lovers,  I can't wait to eat the leftovers.  Our kids loved the honey shrimp, and my husband loved the tuna tataki. The owners are really nice and loving people.  We were strangers to them and they treated us like friends."}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to try out this location because we had been to their previous one and thoroughly enjoyed it. Definitely did not let us down. Wonderful atmosphere, great service, delicious tapas with beautiful presentation, nice patio area and very talented singer. In addition, owners Larry and Emily both came to our table to see how things were, and chat with us about their upcoming plans for the patio area. Enjoyed our time there and look forward to a return visit...."}
{"text":"I love this place and don't understand why they are not packed to the gills every night. It is a little tucked away so maybe people just don't notice it is here. Food is great and caters to dietary restrictions without a blink. Particularly love the Brussel sprouts but also can't get enough of their vegetable tacos. Happy hour Sangria is very generous and delicious. Service is great and the owner always takes the time to come out and talk. Just found out they are open on New Year's day and have some great specials planned.  Hope to get back and enjoy."}
{"text":"We went to Bodega 13 for the first time this evening and had a great experience. We tried a variety of tapas and enjoyed hearing about the special details the chef puts into his creations. Our favorites were the stuffed dates and the scallop under glass. Oh...and the creme brûlée...save room for that! A great local spot with friendly owners who really show a lot of pride and are interested in making sure all of the details are just right. We plan to go back this weekend to try the paella and listen to some local live music!"}
{"text":"What a great experience! Food presentation was amazing and the decor was very nice. The pictures on the internet do not do the place justice.

The seafood paelle was delicious and came to the table in a hot skillet with a twig of flaming rosemary in the center. The aroma was off the hook. Tapas plates are pretty big; definitely made to share. Actually, the paelle and all the tapas we ordered were more than we could eat. We are definitely going back."}
{"text":"Ambiance and decor: great.  Service: so so.  Food: Lobster bisque was very starchy.  Lamb lollipops tasty but really 2 chops for $17????   Grilled octopus tasty but tough.  Rest of meal nothing out of ordinary.  IF return probably to sit at bar for drinks and chilled tapas."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a nice look, and the staff is friendly but by the time we finished dinner we realized it was a carnival of smoke and mirrors. Everyone seemed almost so friendly it was fake and the quality of the food was poor. The chefs are not able to properly execute all these different types of dishes. The owners were also eating at a table in the restaurant, and as some in the restaurant business this is entirely inappropriate. The owners visited our table multiple times during dinner which is a nice gesture but unfortunately all the issues we saw just over shadowed that.


Edit* 
First of all, I am 20 years old. Not that that should matter since my tastebuds work just as good no matter my age. I have been to most of the countries on your menu and know how those dishes should taste. Second of all do you think responding in the manner you did makes my family or I want to come back? The answer to that is no. You are simply incorrect when you say that is normal for owners to sit at their own restaurants. But let's say you were correct, is it appropriate for the owners to continue to sit at their table and eat when they have costumers who are at the next table sending things back?? The coffee my grandparents received was missing the coffee part. In the end a simple apology and \"come give us another chance\" would have made you look so much better but instead you chose to respond immaturely. 

P.S Yes, I did eat most of the desert because my whole family didn't want it and was full yet our waiter pushed it on us. \"You guys will love it, let me just put the order in, you can just all have a few bites.\" I ate it because I felt bad. And I hate to break it to you Larry, but vanilla ice cream with chocolate, caramel, and berries is nothing special. 

Have a great day."}
{"text":"My husband Harold and I were there at the Chef's table dinner to enjoy the extensive menu!  It was absolutely a delicious night in every way!  David the chef served up Creativity and quality dishes!  One after another!  We mingled with the owners and other guests!  A really fun relaxed way to spend a week night or any night!  So let me

{"text":"The chorizo was out of this world good, and I don't usually like sausage.  Also, don't miss the pork tenderloin."}
{"text":"Food and service were excellent! The wife and I loved the tapas as we were able to try a variety of food. We started with the grilled romaine salad and lobster bisque, both were great. The bacon wrapped dates were next and they were amazing, stuffed with blue cheese and the bacon was perfect. From there we had the scallops under the glass and they were our favorite of the night! We followed that with the shrimp and chorizo and it was good but not on par with the other dishes, the sherry sauce was too strong and the chorizo was chewy. The pearl dessert was a great finish and did not disappoint. Can't wait to come back try more of the tapas options."}
{"text":"As a local and living about 1/2 mile away I love these little restaurants around the area and want to support them.  I am really tying with this one, has so much potential but just not doing it.  The decor is very cool, owners story is neat with their desire to share their international travels with you, but he restaurant just isn't doing it for me.  Food is okay, prices are outrageous, and there is never anyone in there but seems like it for how long you have to wait for your food.  I was shocked by the prices and portions, you are across the parking lot from Mastros but you are not Mastros, your prices are similar!  I have been there twice for food, once for brunch and once for apps.  Brunch was not good and the biscuits and gravy were just heated in a microwave.  The apps were very good but extremely small, weren't meant to be shared.  I am okay with that, but you need to look at your pricing.  Is a good place to grab a beer, or a local brew, but they are not served very cold.  Maybe not fair since that could Jd have just been a fluke that day.  I would go there for a drink but would not recommend it for a meal.  I want to like it so bad, and think it could be a great go to place, but just keeps disappointing."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Bodega 13 at least 7-8 times since they opened.  We are slow learners.  We live about 5 minutes away, so we had hoped  this could be our \"go to\" place. Each time there was serious issues with the food or preparation.
The chicken in the picatta  is rubbery and the pork dish could not be cut with a steak knife.  My wife's stir fry had ingredients left out and mainly a flavorless, salty soy sauce mixture.  They were also \"86\" on the desert my wife ordered.
We think it is rather tacky to have the owners sit next to us and have dinner. She asked us how we liked our meals. We expressed our disappointments and her response was \"why don't you try us again in three months\" ????????  We sat at the bar and our service tonight was almost non existent as it appeared the bartender was also waiting on tables.
It appears that the owners treat this as a hobby and not a serious restaurant."}
{"text":"They kindly got our group of 8 in on Christmas without a reservation - and could not have been more gracious throughout the evening. Atmosphere was charming, staff was super friendly, and food was delicious. Fun to try so many different dishes and share them among our group. Can't wait to go back on Paella Night!"}
{"text":"Love this place and the food. Beautiful atmosphere. We loved the tapa style food and drinks. The owners, husband wife team, were present the night my husband and I came for the first time. They approached our table, introduced themselves, made sure everything was to our satisfaction. They talked to us for us for a while just like old friends. They made us feel at home and welcome.  They explained the story behind the restaurant and the inspired dishes. We lived overseas for a year and have traveled all over the world and felt this place was very real and down to earth."}
{"text":"This is a nice upgrade to the former Cellar 13 with expanded Tapas menu and a more complete wine list. It's a cozy venue with a main level bar and group table, a downstairs dining area and nice outdoor patio area. The Tapas menu features dishes from all over the world and most are quite good tasting and well presented. I enjoy the ceaser salad, duck tacos, chicken skewers and most of the shrimp and meat plates. The Paella is also quite tasty. Live music on the patio on weekends."}
{"text":"The ambiance and the food were outstanding.  The service was impeccable.  What a great place for Tapas and drinks. I especially enjoyed conversing with Jessica the Manager.  She was more than gracious to accommodate our big group.  The drinks were flowing and the food was top notch.  Great place to entertain clients and friends.  Awesome staff.  Thanks again for a great evening."}
{"text":"Service was great! The owners even came over to check on us several times. We have some dietary restrictions and they were willing and able to accommodate all of them. Food was delicious. I would highly recommend the tuna poke, jerk chicken, and seafood paella. Glad to have such a great restaurant in our area."}
{"text":"We ate at Bodega 13 the other day...very disappointing. Prices for what they serve were high and portions quite small. I had a cup of bland minestrone...and a grilled cheese with potato chips...18 bucks...and not even good...will not return"}
{"text":"For some reason the last part of my review on 4/12 did not print so I will finish it here:  the accolades that I hear from neighbors and friends makes me believe that those few negative reviews are FALSE NEWS.  But, see for yourself  -  visit Bodega 13 and I am sure it will become one of your favorite spots."}
{"text":"Bodega 13 Restaurant is a quaint little tapas style restaurant. Minimum comfort. Main dining room is in basement and outside patio. Kitchen is upstairs. Service was friendly. Portions are small and expensive. Tasty food. Would recommend for those who not too hungry and have \"deep pockets\"."}
{"text":"Bodega 13 is less than a mile from our house. It is elegantly decorated !! Each time we have been in the food is excellent and staff friendly. 

The location is tucked away in the shopping center and Across from a popular steakhouse ... But the prices at the Bodega13  are much friendlier.

Wouldn't mind some live music to jazz it up and liven the atmosphere !!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here on 5/23.  The owner, Larry, greeted us and gave us the \"honeymoon\" table in front of the fireplace.  The service and food were both excellent.  On Tues. they have half price on select bottles of wine if you order a paella.  We had the seafood paella and it was excellent.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Bodega 13 is a true dining experience!! I went today to celebrate my friends birthday as I knew it would be the perfect place with a wonderful ambiance and delicious food. We loved our tapas and the amazing pearl dessert!!! I can't wait to go again!!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today. This is a small intimate, nicely appointed restaurant. The food was good. Service was good. This is not my style. If you like Tapas, this is the restaurant for you."}
{"text":"exquisite food! i ordered the vegetable tacos-delicious!

though, the service was a bit slow but our server was very helpful.

i will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing tapas restaurant!! I was fortunate enough to stumble in by chance (appointment in the area), and I'm thankful that I did! Pleasant atmosphere, chic decor (with some very interesting features, like their \"flame\" and Chef's tables), and very friendly and engaging owners. 

The menu is very unique, in that it encompasses perhaps the widest variety of cuisine from all over the world (Irish to Filipino) that I've experienced in single restaurant. My only regret is that I couldn't try everything that I wanted without bursting! Fortunately that is something that I will remedy soon, as I'm already planning my next visit. Hopefully, with a group to sit at the chef's table!!"}
{"text":"I left a not so kind review for Bodega 13 on mothers day.  As it turns out the owners were out of town during my prior visit.  After debating a return my wife and I decided to try it again because we reside very close by. We had the opportunity to meet Larry and Emily (owners) and they were amazing.  They were aware of my previous review (1 of 5 stars) and they were excited to have the opportunity to make it better.  They came through with flying colors.  The date tapas were unbelievably tasty with blue cheese crumbles and the Tahitian Pearl desert was just flat out wrong!  Yes its that good, its guaranteed that you will feel guilty after engaging. We were lucky while unknowingly we showed up on Paella night.  What a great dish and the presentation was awesome!  With that said this is one of the most unique restaurants that I have had the pleasure of dining at and I have been to quite a few.  Larry made wonderful suggestions for pairing wine with our meals.  I thought that there was no way that they could do a 180 degrees from my previous experience however  I am very impressed with this GEM of a restaurant and I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Service gets a 5, the bartender was fabulous and very friendly. 

Food was okay nothing phenomenal and we tried several dishes. 

The patio is underwhelming. Nothing special, no view. It's amazing that people rave about an outdoor patio with lights strung. That's literally it. 

Also it's next to a cigar bar which smells from the outside, so if you like the scent of a stogie infiltrating your dinner I guess that the patio ambience for you, not so much for me"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE the food!! Lunch and dinner menus are both awesome! BEST DESSERT EVER! Had the Tahitian a Pearl!"}
{"text":"Cellar 13 closed in May and a wonderful new Tapas restaurant has turned the place around with a whole new look, great outside dining in the back patio with live music on Fridays and Saturdays. The lobster bisque is to die for; having huge chunks of lobster in it. The lamb chops are amazing having a tasty marinade on them making you want more. The bacon wrapped dates are great with blue cheese. Next time I want to try the Paella which looks wonderful and very large. Best creme brulee I've ever had slightly warm and so very fresh. Great service everyone even the owner wants you to be comfortable and makes sure you are happy. There is a full bar and a great selection of good wines. We will certainly return soon."}
{"text":"Wow! The tapas are delicious and there is a vast selection to interest  anyone.  The dates, veggie tacos, and the shrimp were my favorites."}
{"text":"Excellent tapas selections. Fresh, expertly prepared. Presentation of each plate was impressive. The wine selection made it easy to pair our tapas selections with just the right wine. Jordan, our server, was very professional, knowledgeable and helpful.  This was our first time at the restaurant, and Jordan graciously walked us through the whole evening. The Tahitian Pearl dessert was the perfect way to end an already enjoyable dinner. We will return!"}
{"text":"Everything was tasty & fresh!  We had the salmon citrus salad, lobster bisque, glasses scallop & mussels. Lobster bisque was creamy with lots of lobster chunks. Mussels were tender in a light broth with garlic & tomato chunks. The live music was a bonus. We had a delightful evening sitting on the patio."}
{"text":"I was less than impressed with the service here.  We were in the area and decided to come for lunch on a Saturday.  When we arrived the restaurant had, at most, five or six tables filled.  We were seated promptly and received menus straight away.  We ordered a glass of wine and our food, and that's when the wait began. The food was decent, no better or worse than similar restaurants, but the wait and service were pretty poor. Between the time when we sat down to when we received our hamburgers it took an hour...for hamburgers! I know things can get busy, but the restaurant was empty and the long wait was never acknowledged by our server.  A simple \"I'm sorry the food has taken so long\" can go a long way. We had sat there long enough that we slowly finished our glass of wine and our waitress came by before the food arrived to take the empty wine glasses and drink menus...without even asking if we would like anything else to drink.  We had to stop her and ask for for some sort of drink to go with our food. To add insult to injury another staff member started mopping the floor next to us.  Overall the restaurant was nice inside, but could be helped by more attentive service.

Edited: Thank you for taking the time to respond to the review Larry.  I appreciate your response, but am not appreciative of being told I gave false information on a review.  I have no control over when the order was entered, but we, without a doubt, waited an hour to get our burgers.  And, the order you \"checked\" could not have been ours, as neither of us EVER order burgers medium well.  I always order them medium rare.  A more productive response to this would be to apologize for the wait and not accuse your customers of lying.

Edited 11/10/17: At this point the owner Larry has not only accused me of being a liar, but also the review my husband of posting a fake review as well.  He accused the review of being fake because (a) his name wasn't on a credit card (you're right, it wasn't, because he didn't pay), (b) there were no burgers ordered the day he posted it (right, because he didn't post the review directly after he left), and (c) he didn't remember seeing him there (which he did seem to remember in his comment below).  

Sometimes a bad review is just that...it's not fake and it doesn't mean people lied.  Please take more time to improve the service instead of accusing everyone of lying on Yelp."}
{"text":"I love Bodega 13. The service and food are 2nd to none!  I've been three times and never had anything but a really great experience!"}
{"text":"Bodega 13 is a diamond in the rough; what you would expect in a town called CAREFREE!  Stop by and see Larry the owner, Kristin and Yanies. Try the \"CEVICHEHITINI\" you will not be disappointed or I'll buy!!!!
Great food and live music..
Enjoy!"}
