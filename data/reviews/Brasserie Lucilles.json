{"text":"Great food, great service. Food is very flavorful, nice presentation, good portion size. Grilled Seafood was amazing."}
{"text":"Nothing better!! Amazing food! Fantastic service!! People worry if they don't eat seafood they won't have anything to eat. Ribs, steak burgers... Devine!!"}
{"text":"Great little place the food is great and the atmosphere is relax and cosy. It is a great place to chill with friend or just grab a nice glass of wine."}
{"text":"Extremely horrible service and disrespectful staff. Food is ok, Monkland location is much better. For someone who goes out often this is unheard of in Montreal to be treated like garbage they way the entire staff there does. What a shame..."}
{"text":"Used their website's online reservation and arrived at the place 10 minutes early but we were promptly seated. 

The place was almost full (like half were from those having a party) so you can imagine how noisy it is inside.  The place is small; tables are situated close to each other unless you're at the booth.

The staff was accommodating and efficient; wait time was acceptable. Had the following:
(1) Seafood platter (small) - best tasting, fresh oysters; first time to try the [snow] crab legs - meat is fibrous and salty; lobster seemed a little bit overcooked; shrimps - okay
(2) Porterhouse steak - melt in your mouth
(3) Cheesy Mash - my kids enjoyed it
(4) Grilled Octopus with Greek salad (half) - the octopus is so tender and delicious; almost did not notice the salad under the grilled octopus

It is pricey (for us) but the gastronomic experience definitely shouts- \"It's all worth it!\".   Besides, we had oysters, crab legs, lobster and steak."}
{"text":"Never been treated like this in a restaurant before 

went for dinner on Sunday at 8pm ; ordered food as soon as we sat down at the bar;  by 9 we had not gotten anything so asked the manager/owner Ollie (might be his name) who was drunk;  to take a look at why are food was not coming out and he said he could not help us ; then he recommended we go eat somewhere else ;  My friend and I then told him he should not be speaking to clients like that ; that when the drunk manager went to my friends face almost threatening him; so we took our jackets and left 

worst part is that after emailing a complaint to the restaurant; that same night; no one has ever responded to it a week later 
Not very professional and the type of customer service you would expect  from  a restaurant of this caliber; actually ; from any restaurant"}
{"text":"A wonderful place to enjoy good seafood, steaks and wine
Grilled octopus is a treat.
Oysters and clams are a treat
Quite the wine selection too

Great for groups and it's quite an experience !

Enjoy"}
{"text":"Absolutely 1 of my top 5 meals I've ever had. The Food was fantastic, our waitress hit the bullseye with her food and wine suggestions. We were 4 guys with big appetites, we started with a cocktail and the LARGE seafood platter (18 fresh PEI oysters) and a plate of Calamari. We wanted to try so many things on the menu, so with the help of Michelle our waitress we ordered a feast for a king. The Porterhouse, Grilled octopus, Lobster rolls, baked Cauliflower, and Onion rings. Not to mention the 2 bottles of wine that was polished off!! We will defiantly be back!!"}
{"text":"Très bruyant, en plus de la musique super forte. À quatre on y a laissé $400 et on nous a demandé de changer de place après notre dîner pour laisser notre table pour un groupe de 6.....plutôt ordinaire!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing... Everything so delicious, amazing flavours, classics with a twist. Food is so fresh, service is great. Attentive to allergies as well which it is really appreciated. My favorites: roasted cauliflower, grilled lobster and fries, Portuguese chicken... Could eat there every night!"}
{"text":"This place is a bit pricey and the acoustics of the space are horrible. Even when it is only half full the noise level makes it difficult to hear the person sitting across from you. The acoustics are so bad they would generally keep me from ever coming back. However, what makes up for all this are the Lobster Rolls. Simply put they are hands down best in the city. The serving is very generous and worth the price tag. You get two rolls, generously stuffed with lobster, and fries. The fries aren't bad, but the lobster rolls are terrific.
 
To lock in my love for their lobster rolls last week I decided I could make my own lobster rolls. Being lazy and not wanting to deal with the hassle of cooking and de-shelling a fresh lobster I went out and bought some frozen lobster and made myself some lobster rolls for dinner. Upon the first bite of my homemade rolls I immediately had an even greater level of appreciation for the lobster rolls at Lucilles. 

Rating Lucy's becomes a bit of a challenge. I've tried some of their other dishes, but nothing is on the same level as the lobster rolls. In fact if it were not for the lobster rolls I would likely not go back as the rest of the food is not really worth the price and the atmosphere is the pits due to the noise levels. Did I mention =, you can't even hear yourself think in this place? So all in all the lobster roll is 5 stars, the atmosphere is 2 stars and the rest of the food, when taking into consideration the price, is 2.5 stars. So I guess the average works out to 3 stars."}
{"text":"The food was delicious!  We were 2 couples out for an early dinner at 18h and one of only 3 tables.  By 19h the restaurant was packed!  I had a terrific Cajun shrimp salad with avocado and a grilled vegetable side dish that I wouldn't recommend if you like your vegetables with a bit of crunch in them.  They were quite mushy actually but the salad was terrific."}
{"text":"Here's my take on this Lucille's located across the street from Tavern on the Square: 

If you order properly, the food is beyond solid. Their salmon tartare is absolutely unique. It's served with slightly larger than average cubes of fresh salmon in a unique asian coating. They provide you with a wedge of lettuce and crispy Asian noodles to build your own lettuce wraps. It's the type of dish that's so satisfying, that you might go to the restaurant for that reason alone.

Their second standout dish has got to be the lobster rolls. Although lobster rolls are not a typical Montreal dish, Lucille's version stands up to anything you would find on the east coast. Served on a toasted hot dog bun with large chunks of lobster, the execution of this dish is laudable.

In addition to these two stand outs, their steaks are spectacular. Although I didn't order a steak the last time I was there, from memory, they are served with a caramelized crust and dry aged in house.

In order to enjoy this delicious food however, you have to overlook certain less appealing aspects of this establishment that have been listed in countless other reviews:

1. They are not giving this stuff away. Their prices jump off the page as if to say \"We've figured out what you Westmounters like, and now we're going to squeeze you....HARD\"

2. The music on a Saturday night is so loud, that you have to absolutely shout to carry on a conversation. Unless, your dining companion comes equipped with a PA system, you will only understand every second or third word they say. Clearly the owners of this restaurant know that people have complained about this , and clearly they don't care. Maybe studies have shown that people buy more drinks when the music is this loud....I have no idea. This is coming from a guy who loves loud rock music.

On balance however, I'm willing to put up with the inflated prices and ridiculous volume of music for the food. Once you get your fix, you're probabably good for the next 5 months or so."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. which deserves a 4-star rating. Unfortunately, two things ding 3 stars off the review.
Ambiance is way too loud and restaurant is over packed. Time for them to realize that its not comfortable for customers to get hit by waiters everytime they pass by our table. Worst of all, as many mentioned, manager is a complete jerk. Really dosen't care about his customers and seems to care more about himself then anything else. Too bad the food was good, but i wont be coming back since the service lacked."}
{"text":"I much prefer this new Lucilles location as there's a lot more dining room. That said, we went on a Sunday night and had no more tuna tartar, veal chops and fish tacos - a little disappointing... However, everything else we ordered instead was absolutely delicious. My advice is to maybe not go on a Sunday night when inventory levels are low?"}
{"text":"Mixed review amazing steak at 60$ the worst calamari I've ever eaten at 16$ , the octopus better on monkland. 
At the prices you are charging, perfect what your good at, or dump it! 
It was a birthday dinner, desert was ordered. No candle was provided but a fiery saobuco shot used instead that was not ordered and which was charged to the dinner . A Very pricey dinner."}
{"text":"The service was super slow. We waited 45 minutes for our main meal to arrive. The waiter rarely came to refill our water.

In regards to food, it was alright. The best part was the mashed potato side dish. The surf and turf dish was alright. The ribs were a little dry but it could have been worst. The overall experience was okay."}
{"text":"Good food, good vibe and overall awesome experience. Surprisingly busy for a Monday in this part of town. A bit on the pricey side, but seafood always is... We will be back."}
{"text":"It was my second time to the resto, and i would have given it 4 stars if the service was a bit more on point. Food itself was good, we had the cajun shrimp salad, grilled octopus, and the taco board.

Cajun shrimp salad: the shrimps were very well seasoned and crunchy, great balance with the tomatoes and avocado.

Grilled octopus: im usually not an octopus fan, but it had good flavor and well grilled. Usually octopuses have less flavor and are more bland at the center, but this wasn't the case.

Taco board: we replaced the beef with more chicken, and overall it was good. The platter presentation needs some work though. I'd suggest to put the proteins in the middle, for example. Very filling, even for two people.

The service was elegant, but forgetful. It happened many times that we had to repeat requests (for an extra fork, for napkins, etc). I'm picky about service, hence the 3 stars. Otherwise, 4 stars!"}
{"text":"can't talk about other experiences, but tonight me and my buddy Yvan had a great time. we had the seafood entrée with some drinks and as a main course we went with each a great steak.

prices are significant but the quality was there and with an easy staff. at some point employees asked us to change place for a larger group and accepted. a few minutes later they were back with drinks to thank us.

great experience from my part, maybe we were just lucky, or maybe we're easygoing and keep things simple ; )"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place as much as I like Lucille's Oyster Dive on Monkland but one thing prevented me from doing so. Last night I ordered the Starter plate of Crab Cakes. Yes, they were delicious and well-plated but at $24 for two thin, small discs, it was easily $10 over-priced.  In fact, they were even more expensive than the Entrée size plate of Ribs & Fries, which was such a large serving that we ended up taking home half of that portion .Won't be ordering those again!"}
{"text":"I think the food was pretty good, too many distractions to really remember. Very meaty ribs. Being from the east coast, the lobster rolls were passible, seeing it was so far out of season and not cooked in sea water. The octopus was fantastic, but it was a first for me. 

However, the whole evening was over shadowed by a constant chair kicking by staff and patrons as they passed by. Far too many tables for the space. The bar could be half the size if they wanted table space. Hard to have a private conversation, I wished little Jenny good luck on her exams and felt bad for her dog, as i left. She sat two tables over. 

The cold air from outside was a problem as people kept coming and going. And the people waiting for a table literally stood over people trying to enjoy a meal. 

Plus the hired models shouldn't be wearing open toed stilettos as they serve food in dresses they can't bend over in. I say models, because they would an insult to wait staff to call them servers. But i guess they have to be that size to fit between tables. A staff member working in Westmount should at least have a grasp of the menu in English. And memory capabilities longer of that of a goldfish. But she was young and inexperienced. Why is salt and pepper not on the table to start with? The lack of parking is another problem. 

It will be hard to convince me to go out of my way to go back. Plenty of other restaurants to consider before returning."}
{"text":"I'm torn about this one. A friend picked it, it was perfect location for the group that was meeting. It is a beautiful sexy dim room and the service was so kind and quick and helpful. We arrived a good 40 minutes before our reservation and they didn't bat an eye, just welcomed the early birds and quickly brought us drinks. 

When I looked at the prices on the food menu I was kind of furious, these prices are jumped up even for Westmount and it bothers me that people pay for it. I was hungry but could not bring myself to pay $30-$50 for pasta or a taco platter. We had a dozen oysters at over $2 an oyster and there was shell in 2 of the 4 I tried. I really don't mind paying for an amazing meal at all, but this bugged me. 

I ended up ordering off the apps menu, ordered the fish tacos, and here I was pleasantly surprised. The tacos came out quick and they were fat, filling and fabulous. 

The vibe was surprisingly cosy and friendly, we ended up staying late, laughing with the staff and drinking delicious cava. I'm hesitating between 3 and 4 stars, but the oysters are really stuck in my craw so I'm docking a star, but if I had the right occasion I'd be happy to come back and give it another shot."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and follow up to their Monkland location. The food and service were phenomenal. The portions are big and full of flavor. I highly recommend the Chicken Parmesean, veal milanese and taco platter. I didn't care too much for the desserts, the selection was a bit limited."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurant for oysters in Montreal, the food is impeccable, dishes are tasty, crab cakes are excellent, great seafood plates like shrimps, crabs Lobster tails etc...Steaks was very good i took the Montana's cut, which was well cooked and well marinated, the only thing i could complain about is the price, yes its pricey but you het what you paid for!! 
Seafood bloody Caesar is a must try"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. The ambiance, the crowd but most importantly THE FOOD. The seafood here is awesome. The raw bar (though hard to \"miss\") is great and gives you a great variety of shell fish and is generous in portion. The grilled octopus is very tasty along with the Greek salad as well as the tartare. However, they also
Have AMAZING meat which was a surprise to me since this place came across as more of a seafood style place. 
I once went with a group and we shared the chateaubriand which was delicious and mouth watering. I also went another time and got the filet mignon which, in my opinion, is hands down the best filet I've
Had in Montreal. It was charred perfectly and tasted simply magnificent (if that's not weird to say about meat!).
Would recommend to everyone!

Side note: yes the service is somewhat slow but when the food is this good, you just can't pass it by for this reason"}
{"text":"If the main location is anywhere near as good as the tapas spot on Atwater, you're in for a real treat. I've been a few times now and each time it reminds me in kind as to why I keep coming back. If you're a seafood lover this will quickly become a new go-to place on a hot day, if not don't worry, they have a great selection of barbecued dishes as well! So far my wife and I have split salmon tartar, prawns on avocado, piri-piri shrimp & chicken tacos, ribs with slaw, nachos with guacamole, and a few other things that I'm having trouble remember. All this to say there's a great selection and it's all super FRESH! As far as drinks they have two beers on tap Creemore Springs and there house blonde (which I would suggest) as well as sangria and lemonade. The service is always quick, super friendly and knows their product (my wife is a celiac and they let her know what is safe for her to eat and what isn't). The closest thing to a negative comment I can say is they keep me from trying all of the other stands because I keep wanting to go back. But seriously, give it a shot; you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Before I begin my review, I have to say thanks to their wonderful bartender (whom I unfortunately forgot the name of), I'm satisfied giving the 4 stars. (Not even going to mention our server the second time, otherwise, it would be much less). 

Referring to my better experience, Brassière Lucilles is a well known restaurant in Westmount, with the spotlight on their seafood, more specifically, lobster dishes. 

The vibe in the restaurant is always very uplifting and lively. People chatting, laughing, or just coming for a quick date night. I would say the crowd has seemed to be a mix of younger/older professionals. 

Back to my experience: I grabbed a seat at the bar and started going through the menu, while starting with a bottle of wine. Their wine list is not too extensive and they were out of the sparkling wine I had first picked, but settled for a bottle of old school Chateau Maris. Deciding what to eat, they had a decent variety of options. I chose a whole lobster because after all it is what they are known for. Before I knew it, the whole lobster was on its way. The food came out relatively fast. While it was exactly what I ordered, it did not have anything surprising or special about it. Nothing to complain about, just no WOW factor. I then ordered the lobsters rolls and they definitely had more flavour and savouriness to them. 

A bonus is they are open on Sunday. 

After a couple bottles of wine, a martini, and my meal, you are expected to pay quite a bit. I suppose you are mostly paying for ambience. I was happy to pay and enjoy the rest of my night."}
{"text":"Came here last night with a group of friends, and I was so impressed with the service and the attention to detail of their staff. A friend and I used to go to the dive on Monkland regularly until we were very poorly treated by their rude manager, so we went out on a bit of a limb trying the brasserie, and I'm so glad we did. Everything from the manager to the staff to the food was perfect! The girls from Mckibbins Irish pub thank you guys. We will definitely be back to the brasserie!"}
{"text":"I was a restaurant writer in New York for years, and seldom have I felt so ripped off and badly served at a restaurant. Sure, the food tastes good, but it is clear they mistreat their staff - the female servers are in leather mini skirts and high heels - and try any trick in the book to overcharge. They added an extra dish to our check, and weren't confused for a moment when we pointed it out. We also used a gift certificate and they rounded up without telling us. I feel like I need to take a shower after leaving there it's so skeezy. There are way better places to drop that much money on food in this city."}
{"text":"Excellent upscale service. The food was very well done. lots of great Oysters and the atmosphere was very livley"}
{"text":"I brought my boyfriend to Brasserie Lucilles for his birthday and since then, he keeps talking about how good it was.

Service was a little slow but i guess its normal because the restaurant was crowded (its a tiny place so it was tight too..) these are my only complaints.

The food was SO good, we had oysters (the best i've had, just sooooo fresh) a blue cheese salad (delicious) and the filet mignon (you gotta have one for sure if you go there) even the people next to us were looking and impressed! We had snowcrab too, excellent as well.

Food : 5 stars 
Place : 3 1/2 stars
So ill give a 4 stars even if the food was awesome."}
{"text":"Portuguese Chicken. I was in town for business and had the pleasure of being taken here for dinner.  It was in the middle of a blizzard and the place was still pretty full, which was a great sign!  It's a nice little bar and restaurant and we were seated quickly.  I was told that quite simply I was brought here to try out the Portuguese Chicken, so that is what I ordered.  There were only two orders left for the night, so my timing was perfect.  It came out served on a wooden platter in all its charred goodness.  The skin had the perfect amount of crispiness, smokiness and spices rubbed in.  Underneath was moist and delicious.  Some of the best roast chicken I've had.  I'd definitely be back if make it back to Montreal again."}
{"text":"I was recently asked by a friend what I thought was the best place for a steak. Without hesitation I said \"Moishes\", but to my shock he told me he used to think that as well until he tried the newly opened Brasserie Lucilles. I found that hard to believe but decided I had to see it to believe it.  Steak was very good but I could never say the best.  
     What did leave a bad taste in my mouth was the fact I ordered a Kansas cut and was served a T-Bone.  I didn't mind eating the T-Bone and certainly wasn't going to send it back but what really got to me is when I pointed out this error.  I got told by two waitresses that their manager told them they are completely out of T-Bone and it was most certainly a Kansas cut on my plate even though it had the tell tale T-shaped bone connected to it... WTF?  What was the worst part is one them felt the need to tell me what a Kansas cut is and it always has that bone but yet she never eats meat...WTF? 
     Anyway, whatever... considering management chooses and dresses the women working here to be eye candy, I don't think training is a priority and simply expect most clientele will be looking everywhere but their plate. Other than that, appetizers were pretty good but would have been more enjoyable without all the fruit flies buzzing around, and the fries that accompanied the steak were soggy and boring.  I'll stick with Moishes as the best steak in town, their staff clearly have the knowledge & experience."}
{"text":"Lovely off the charts best oyster bar ever!!!
I went to the one on monkland but this one is wayy nicer and Bigger! Pretty waitresses as well ! Well ok let me rephrase this both places have very beautiful ladies working for them that's why they're so busy all the time hahaha. 

Service was Fabulous ! We were served by a sweet blonde lady who really too good care of us! She took our orders so quickly .. Had our drinks& food so fast! 5+++++

The food was to die for!! I had the cajun shrimp and avocado with coleslaw and blackened chicken.. The shrimp was succulent and flavourful. Woow writing this makes me want to go back for more. The chicken however was a tad dry for my liking. 
My cocktail was delicious i had the sweet lemonade martini one very sour and sweet .. I really enjoyed it! 

Overall, the Lucille's filliale never disappoints! I think they are really amazing .. I know they're known for their oysters but they also have other options that are AMAZING as well and are not credited enough. Definitely coming back for moree yummyyyyyy"}
{"text":"This Resturant is usually my go to place when I have company in town . There always good food and great service . Tonight unfortunately that wasn't the case . Our wateriest acknowledged us until the food was on the table . Afterwards never came back. After a complaint to management she still didn't come back to the table to finish our service . We were not offered a different waiter to sit to our needs. Must say tonight one of my favourite Montreal Resturant fell through."}
{"text":"I read the reviews posted for this restaurant. I went there last night and had a completely different experience. Sure it was loud,but I knew that before I went. The service was very good and very friendly. The food was outstanding. Best lobster roll outside of Maine."}
{"text":"Ok, I will be very clear: AVOID this restaurant. Waitresses are unfriendly (they give you attitude and don't smile), service is slow, food portions are ridiculously small (one crab patty? Seriously?) and way overpriced for the quality you get, which is pretty average. I left feeling ripped off and nauseated. Will not be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is more of a \"to be seen at\" spot than a place to have good food. 
The only positive I could find is the oysters. Definitely fresh - but hey, how many other places you can have that at?
Now onto why the loss of 3 stars. As you walk in, the noise level is so high, you need to take a minute to adjust to the loud music topped with people trying to have conversations on top of it (read: yelling). Once your earbuds are almost bleeding, you see that the place is packed and you get a little excited because a busy place is usually a sign of good business and good food, right? Well, the answer is no. You're almost sitting on top of each other, the service is lacking - hard to get the waiter/waitress' attention, long waits between services. The food is uninspiring which makes you feel like it's way overpriced (it is not cheap to start with). 
What marked this place off for me is the wine. Not the list or selection but how they store it. I had a nice mid-range Italian red that was served warm (think room temperature when it's 26-27 degrees). We thought it was weird considering cellar temperatures are around 12-14 so I decided to look around and realized that the bottles are lined on a shelf, next to the kitchen, with the light straight on them. C'mon, when I order a 90$ bottle of red, I expect it to be well stored or served at a decent temperature. When we voiced our concern, we were replied there was nothing to be done.. Until I asked for a ice bucket, like you would normally for a white. Great way to solve problems. You put the \"F\" in effort.
Not recommending this place to people who love food or for anything that involves conversations. 
Absolutely a fantastic place to act bougie, seen and be seen (and remain hungry if, like me, you stop eating if it's not good)"}
{"text":"The BEST lobster rolls in the city- bar none.

Came here for dinner last night with a good buddy since I've heard nothing but good things about this place from other friends who had gone. Since this was my first time here, I opted to try their famous seafood cocktail, which came with an oyster in its shell, a whole crab leg and a shrimp on a skewer-stick. As a starter drink, it's practically a meal in itself. 
Both buddy and I then opted for the Surf n' Turf, which is basically a lobster roll,  baby back ribs and fries. I figure it's always good to start with something small, see how that goes, and if it's fantastic, I'll come again and try out their other \"bigger\" items.
The lobster roll was perfection. Buddy is a native Maritimer and said it was as great as the rolls out east on the coast. Definitely worth it. The ribs were extremely filling and came right off the bone. Both of us were stuffed but I know that the next time I come, the steaks and lobsters will definitely be on my radar screen.
Since it was quite early in the evening and a Tuesday night to boot,  there were plenty of seats and the noise level was not as loud as other reviewers have indicated. Service was very pleasant and friendly. While it's not cheap, if you nix ordering the oysters, the bill is still manageable.  
I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Food was good but it was overpriced for what we got. There is a lot of hype about this place and I understand it since it's a nice modern trendy place. Go with friends and have a few laughs and drinks and you will love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great location, great seating.. Booths are set high, loud and lively atmosphere.. I particularly enjoyed the lobster rolls, very tasty and filling!"}
