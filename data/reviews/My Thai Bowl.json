{"text":"Friendly, fast service & delicious food. My new favorite Thai place! Their Tom Yum is delicious & my hubby really liked their Pad Thai."}
{"text":"I've always had my favorite Thai places wherever I've lived. NM, GA, MS and now AZ. This is a perfect place to run in and grab a bite, not too fancy but nice and clean. I got the Massaman Curry which was as good as any I've had. They seem to have all of the basics that you would find at any Thai restaurant. Only area for improvement would be the water out of the fountain drink area, it doesn't taste filtered, tastes like it is full of minerals and has that taste you know what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"Great Thai food. We orders extra spicy Thai Basil and vegetable fried rice,  and they were perfect. Very clean restaurant and friendly service."}
{"text":"The owner also owns Thai Patio in Mesa also. I really enjoy his restaurants and this little place is definitely on point. I got the Pad See Ew and it was delish! Thai Iced Tea to quench my thirst. Wanted to try a different venue and would recommend anyone near this little establishment to give it a try. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Got a take out order.  The gal working the register was awesome.  Very helpful and super friendly. The place itself looked very clean and modern.  I decided on the Tom Yum soup with a side of rice and the mussaman curry with chicken.  First, they packed the items nicely.  Both dishes were soupy and not a drop was spilled on the way home.  The Tom Yum w/rice was for my hubby.  He loved it.  The only thing he did not like was that they left inedible stuff in the soup like thai basil leaves and lots of lemon grass stalks.  Not a deal breaker for getting it again, just would have preferred it not in there.  The mussaman was for me.  They offer no spice, mild, medium, etc.  I opted for mild but would probably go for medium for my next curry dish.  The mussaman curry was a little to sweet for my taste but I still ate it for dinner and lunch the next day so it was still good.  I do recommend this place.  I will be back and am looking forward to trying different menu items.  They have a lot of interesting choices."}
{"text":"Was in Mesa and looking for a good lunch spot.  I pulled in and found an excellent, clean and savory new Thai place, \"My Thai Bowl.\"  I was surprised that at 11:30 on a Friday the place was empty, which is usually a bad sign.  But needlessly to say I was greeted with a smile and served quickly.  I had the Penang curry with chicken, which came with a large scoop of rice and a small salad.  The salad was excellent.  I could have eaten a huge bowl this alone.  But was was very satisfied and full after consuming the Penang curry.  I would suggest this restaurant to those who enjoy a clean, relaxing atmosphere where you grab a quick tasty lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This place was Delicious! Exceeded my expectations and I will be back! The pad see ew was so tasty!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good yellow curry. Asked for medium spice and got medium sauce. This dish is sweet spicy and creamy. Also comes with a side salad. Delicious! Nice pop music playing as well!"}
{"text":"I ordered cashew sauce with chicken for delivery to my home. ET was stated as 6:44 pm however the food didn't show up till 7:15 it so. Strike 1. I opened the rice  and it was barely lukewarm. Strike 2. The cashew sauce with chicken was also barely warm.  The bell peppers were mushy as they had continued cooking during delivery . Sauce was thin & watery. Whole order had a plastic after taste. Strike 3"}
{"text":"We had the tom yum soup and the pad sew ew. I was surprised that the tom yum soup only had chicken, galangal, lemon slices, lemongrass, and kaffir lime leaves in it. I was expecting the tom yum soup to have some noodles in it. I thought that the tom yum soup and a good strong, but salty flavor. The pad sew ew also had a nice, strong flavor to it with noodles that had a soy sauce taste. There were also a few broccoli stalks in the pad sew ew. The restaurant was pretty empty when we first arrived, but as the dinner hour came closer, more people came into the restaurant."}
{"text":"Oh yah! The Panang curry was OUTSTANDING! Hot, fresh, great mix of flavors... so good! The restaurant was clean, pleasant music, helpful workers. Laid back atmosphere with real bowls, plates and utensils. I can't wait to try some other dishes. I already sent my wife a text about this place. That's how you KNOW it was good!!"}
{"text":"I've had a lot of Thai food. This was amazing. Thai BBQ chicken, Pad Thai, and Mussamun curry were all terrific. Never had Mussamun curry before, but the sweet and spicy flavor was worth the risk. Probably my favorite curry ever.  Sweet sticky rice with mangos was also delicious. Great service, nice new place. We'll be back."}
{"text":"so glad i came across this place.  the best thai food i have had in the city.  red curry and drunken noodles were so flavorful. i agree...maybe not the most authentic but very tasty and fast!  I brought back my kids and they were all happy and full!  very friendly and clean as well."}
{"text":"EVERYBODY, THIS PLACE IS GREAT! I loved all the choices and the staff was friendly! Got full off the big portions! Keep up the flavors!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!   4th time here and I needed to write something somewhere because it's ridiculously good.  Food is just awesome, staff are the nicest people and the restaurant is always super clean and inviting.  For the price I cannot imagine getting anything better."}
{"text":"Surprised to walk in and see a smiling friendly face. The owner of My Thai Bowl also owns Thai Patio in Mesa. So we knew the moment we saw her the food was going to be delicious. And once again we weren't disappointed. My girlfriend and I have been going to Thai Patio for 5 years now and we will continue to be patrons there and now at My Thai Bowl. They have great lunch specials and their dinner portions are huge. Always hits the spot, always delicious, always a customer."}
{"text":"Wow! What a hidden gem. Phenomenal food and fantastic food. You got to try the Tom Kahn soup--a whole new genre of comfort food.There was 9 in our group and they got us right on."}
{"text":"Very clean and modern little place. Quick, friendly service and the food was fantastic. Highly recommend the yellow curry, crab puffs and Thai tea!"}
{"text":"I keep coming back here. I LOVE this place! My favorite is the crab fried rice medium spice. REAL crab meat, seasoned perfectly. The ambiance is pleasant and everyone is very friendly! The food is really, really good!"}
{"text":"I loved the panang curry I had tonight! The Thai iced tea was also an excellent treat. Will for sure come back again soon!"}
{"text":"I tend to be an extrmely picky eater but this place is amazing! The owner and staff are extremely friendly and attentive, the restaurant is very clean and pretty, the food is packed woth flavor and very well balanced! I think the price point is perfect for what you get. The drinks are a little pricey but that is common with many establishments. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Super yum Thai food. Order at counter and they serve it to the table. Mix between sit down and fast food. Nice atmosphere , nice employees and super sweet owner. This is our new favorite Thai place in our area. Prices are comparable to other Thai restaurants. Everything we've tried is super flavorful and true to Thai style. Our favorite is Rad Nar, add extra noodles for $2. Thai basil with chicken is delicious, love the strong basil and fresh veggies. Thai fried rice is on point. Good servings that'll fill you up!"}
{"text":"The service was fabulous. The gal at the counter was helpful with choices and spice. She also was attentive to all guests. That's rare these days and she was great! I ordered the red curry and it was fabulous. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"My family really enjoyed our time at My Thai Bowl! First of all the food was very tasty and portion sizes were good/average! The prices are around the same or a few dollars cheaper than other Thai restaurants in the east valley. My family had the panang and yellow curries, fried egg rolls, and the mango delight with beef. All of the colors, textures,  and tastes were spot on.   The owners and workers exemplified great customer service! We were promptly greeted and the lady explained the ordering process. The restaurant is counter order but they will bring your meal to you. They then moved around the tables to make room for my baby's stroller. The lady talked to us and interacted with our baby, very sweet. The gentleman held the door for us and thanked us when we left.   The restaurant has a modern, clean appearance. It's located in the old SubZero spot and definitely remodeled. It was a pleasant place for a Friday night dinner with my family. My dad even got a hug from the lady as we were leaving because he told her how much he enjoyed his birthday dinner there.   I highly recommend this place for a quick,  delicious, and affordable Thai meal!"}
{"text":"My BF and I tried My Thai Bowl last night, and we were both HIGHLY impressed. A nice clean open space, with two large screen TVs, one showing the Travel Channel, the other Food Network, both with the sound turned down. You order at the counter and they bring the food to you. Soda is self-serve. I had the Shrimp Pad See Ew, and my BF had Massaman Curry Chicken. There were 7 large shrimp in my dish, lots of vegetables, the wide noodles of course, all in a very yummy sauce. I ordered mild, and it arrived very well spiced without being \"hot\". My BF enjoyed his medium-spiced Massaman (he will write his own review). We definitely plan on returning soon!"}
{"text":"Modern, open and airy location. Great spot for lunch. Has a lunch special. Ordered mango delight beef. Food comes out reasonably quick. Order and pay at the counter. The taste and quality of my meal was excellent. The mango and basil go great with the mild spice and tang of this dish. Great summer food that leaves you feeling light. Knocking off a star due to small portion of beef in my dish. Has a decent variety for fans of various popular thai recipes, but nothing too off the wall here. I thought it would be more processed when I came in but was glad to find it is being cooked to order in the back."}
{"text":"Ohmyword soooo happy we randomly saw this and decided to give it a try. Two thumbs way way up for the Mussamun curry (mild,) the unique but amazing BBQ chicken, and the pad Thai with chicken. The add on salad with \"excellent\" sauce REALLY was excellent! Don't miss the sticky rice with mango for dessert. Truly a fantastic dinner, and the service and atmosphere were perfect, too. They have lunch specials, too. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's so delicious and they have such great customer service! The guy with the pony tail at the register is really pleasant! I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We happened onto this place. Absolutely excellent food. Very fresh and lots of veggies. The salad roll as an appetizer was delicious and the dip for it was amazing. Being vegan can be tricky eating out be she was very accommodating and made some great suggestions. The restaurant was clean and tidy. The woman that helped us was great and so friendly."}
{"text":"Wow! This is a hidden gem, absolutely amazing. I went here with my boyfriend and got the egg rolls for an appetizer. Light and crispy, so good. Then I got the Wonton Shrimp Soup and he got the Chicken Pad See Ew. We both loved them."}
{"text":"This is my first time here, they just opened 2 days ago. Service is very polite and helpful.   I decided on the cashew nut pork, it's a very nice sized helping along with a huge scoop of rice. Delicious! Definitely will be bringing some friends here."}
{"text":"Great panang & pad thai, not the best service from the front register guy he seemed overwhelmed but food came out quicy & hot. Location is clean & very modern, not a hole in the wall, overall would recommend."}
{"text":"We stopped in here to pick up dinner one night about a week ago. Most of the food was alright, though the dumplings were an unpleasant texture the flavor was ok and my son asked for his beef curry to be thai hot and although he said it was spicy, it was not thai hot. This is one of those things that super bother me about places that offer a super spicy option, if you offer it, put a disclaimer on it that if it's too hot, you've been warned and no refunds will be given, don't pull punches, my son knew what he was ordering and he was let down.  The worst was that my daughter VERY clearly stated several times to the lady taking our order that she was a VEGAN and the lady advised my daughter that pretty much anything could be made vegan. So she ordered her food and when we got home she took several bites before she realized that there was scrambled egg in her food. WHAT THE HELL. She cried, like literally, because she'd eaten egg. What do you think VEGAN means?!?!  I did enjoy the red curry chicken, but not worth going back after how much this place upset my daughter."}
{"text":"everything felt fresh , taste wise it was good (I have had better though ) for what it was worth, I had a great time."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!! The restaurant is very clean, the food is hot a fresh, and the service is fast! Staff here is so friendly and does everything they can to make sure you're a happy customer. We're going back for lunch twice in a row, and will be going next week too! Definitely worth checking out! Only critique I have is that the items on the menu are not as descriptive as the take home menu. Other than that, food was great! Get the curry!"}
{"text":"My Thai Bowl is great - the ingredients tasted fresh and the spice was nice. The portions were a decent size and the presentation was on point.   Taste? The Chicken Panang was delicious, sweet heat and fresh veggies. The chicken pad Thai was delicious too - and for dessert the fried banana and ice cream.  Well be back"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now, and will be going   Again for sure! I have had the pad thai which was okay, not my favorite. The next time I visited I had the sweet and sour lunch special and it was SO DELICIOUS! The lunch deal is pretty good if you ask me. I also love their Thai iced tea!!!"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place ambiance is amazing service is great but the food is the best ."}
{"text":"We just tried this place this evening looking for a quicker option for dinner. The place is cute and clean, you order at the register then grab a seat. Prices are pretty fair, not too high not necessarily inexpensive. I ordered Thai bbq chicken. It was my first time ordering this meal. I felt it taste ok but could do without the crazy presentation (lots of bone in chicken). The other two got shrimp fried rice and the mango delight with chicken. Not enough chicken in the mango delight and the shrimp was tail on for the fried rice. Overall pretty good experience. Next time I will have to try the pad thai."}
{"text":"My dad had told me this place recently opened up and we decided to try it. I put in an order to go, it could have been ready in 5 minutes which was great! We were starving! Lol anyways when I went to pick up the food it was fresh and the girl at the counter was really nice. The place itself was decorated nicely and very clean.   Now to the important part. The food.  We got chicken Pad Thai which was my favorite out of he three items we got. The beef Thai fried rice was super flavorful! My dad really enjoyed the shrimp Tom yum. We also got their Thai tea which was so good it had me wanting more.  The servings were enough for me, my not so little brother, and my father. We were all satisfied and STUFFED!   I wish this place was closer to where I live! Lol"}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant and food not bad. I have had better. The lady owner is nice. Food taste ok not wow.. but pricey. Clean place. For place your order at the counter and get your own drinks and napkins stuff too pricey. Orient sushi which is not far away( McQueen / Elliott) is better in taste and price. Don't think would go back if I can get better at orient sushi and cheaper."}
{"text":"Amazing! That's all I can say.... definitely coming back to try more menu items.  Waited a little bit for food but sooo worth the wait.  We had the drunken noodles with tofu and panang curry with pork....  and they are very nice too :-)"}
{"text":"Decided to try this restaurant on a whim tonight. Entered the restaurant and received a menu and sat down at a table to review the menu. Noticed that the prices seemed a little bit high by a few dollars, and that getting a bowl of chicken fried rice for four or five dollars was unavailable. Being that their name has bowl in it, I anticipated better price points on the menu. Some items were priced very reasonably, but most items were overpriced. The food when I received it was acceptable on the one hand for one thing I ordered, and on the other hand the main dish that I ordered was not thoughtfully prepared. I have had what I've ordered at other restaurants on many occasions. My main course just appeared to me to not have been thoughtfully prepared. As well it did not taste as flavorful as I would expect and have experienced at other restaurants serving the same food. This restaurant would benefit from thoughtful reflection on the pricing of their food and also on the thoughtfulness of the meals that they prepare. There are some disconnects that are apparent here, and by addressing them they could have a very successful business in the future. For now I won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"The pad Thai was okay. It tastes a bit different than most pad Thai because of the sauce. Otherwise the atmosphere is great, the staff is super friendly, and they have a lot of options!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent. However the wait is not too bad if they don't forget your order. I came in with some coworkers, I ordered first. While all of them receive their food pretty quickly I waited over 30 minutes just to learn that they forgotten all about my order entirely. The manager Audi, was very apologetic and said my next meal would be free. I will definitely go back The food was amazing. I ordered pad Thai chicken noodle spice level medium and it was phenomenal. Unfortunately I had to take it to go as my lunch hour was up by this point."}
{"text":"Nice new Thai restaurant. Clean, fast-food type place where you order at the counter then can sit and eat or take it  to go. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I love the crab Puffs I will eat about three orders of them my husband likes the pad thai. For those who do not know they have a sister location in Mesa called My Thai patio"}
{"text":"Omg! Best green curry EVER! My friend had the Pad Thai sooo good! Great customer service! Portions for lunch size are perfect! This will become a staple in our Phoenix eateries!!!!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and decorating is wonderful. They are so friendly! We ordered the pineapple fried rice, pot stickers and sweet and sour chicken. All was fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch and so glad we did. Excellent lunch options, generous portions and really fresh. The coconut curry chicken was delicious. Glad we came early as it was busy by noon."}
{"text":"Excellent food with a real Thai flavor. Staff are helpful and the place is spotless. Food brought to the table quickly and the girl even checked everything was ok."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It is close to work which is fabulous for me, it is clean, and the people are always nice. I have had green and red curry, pad thai, summer rolls, and thai tea here on separate occasions and all were delicious."}
{"text":"Service Good. Food does not taste authentic. Very mediocre. Drunken noodle is not thick flat noodle but a pad Thai noodle. I was not told this at purchase. Clean and nice people but does not taste like authentic Thai."}
{"text":"We stopped by due to hunger pains.  Ordered the Chicken Pad  Thai, Crab Fried Rice and Tom Yum soup with shrimp.   EVERYTHING was AMAZING!!!! Service was polite and prompt.  Surroundings are beautiful and peaceful.  Highly recommend !!!!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed.  Very small portion considering the price. Can I give half star? I was asked if I want a cup of water, I said yes then I was charged for a drink cost me $2.50 from the fountain station...what a rip off!"}
{"text":"I never give 1 stars. However i feel this place deserves it. I ordered the pad Thai which was dry and mushy and horrible. I also asked for lime or lemon and they told me they don't have any.  They said I could try using the slices of lemon \"to try to squeeze some on the food\". Pad Thai is always served with a side of lime. Also you can judge a thai restaurant by the taste of the pad thai. This place by far has failed miserable. Won't return"}
{"text":"Happened to drive by this place and since we love Thai food decided to stop. The food definitely did not disappoint! The service was also extremely friendly. I got the dish with chicken and peanut sauce, and I'm already hooked! The homemade salad dressing was also delicious. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was going to go to Jason's Deli  but saw the no gun sign so tried here instead. I had the Tom Kah. It was good but had too much galangal root in it. I'll come again tho to try their curry."}
{"text":"1st time trying this place and was pleasantly surprised. Very good. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"One of the worst Thai restaurants I have ever eaten at.  Decor is pleasant and modern but that's the most this place has going for it.   Its an order at the counter setup.  The menu is limited and they do not offer many different popular thai dishes (ie. pad woon sen, pad prik khing, etc).  I ordered the mussaman curry. A hearty curry dish with onions, potatoes, and peanuts.  I would have been better off ordering dessert considering how much sugar was in the entree.  Sickeningly sweet..... Awful.  I asked for some Prik Nam Pla (sliced thai chilis in fish sauce) to try to balance out the sweetness.  The woman behind the counter said she would bring some, but never did.   With many decent thai restaurants in the valley, there is definitely no need for me to return."}
