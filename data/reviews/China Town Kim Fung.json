{"text":"This dim sum restaurant was highly recommended by locals, but I found the food disappointing.    Bottom line is if you have been spoiled by the Chinese restaurants in New York, the food at Maison Kam Fung doesn't measure up."}
{"text":"It's quieter on a weekday near noontime, and the dimsum ladies pay you more attention. All the same, I'd come with a Cantonese speaking friend, or I'd come knowing what to choose. The congee was good and supplies you with spoons, as is the hargao and siewmai, but the xiaolongbao was dry and the guotie was not fried as much as I'd have liked. To finish up we had fried dough balls with sesame and red bean or lotus paste inside, which was surprisingly up to standards. Came up to about 4.5 or 5 per dish of 3 or 4 items."}
{"text":"A Toronto native, I'm used to having authentic, mind-blowing chinese food and dim sum. So while visiting Montreal, my relatives brought me to Maison Kam Fung which they claimed is the best Chinese food you'll get in Montreal. Considering how tiny Montreal's Chinatown is, I believed them.

Maison Kam Fung was really busy when we got there, but we were seated within 10 minutes. The attractive aspect of this place is the traditional way in which the dim-sum is brought (or carted) out. There are not many places nowadays that use the carts because it just causes too much problems (i.e. bumping into people, etc). 

The food itself was alright. Not good, by any means, but you don't go to Montreal to eat Chinese food. Overall, I won't be going again, unless I'm desperate to satisfy my monosodium glutamate cravings."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from here. First the food was so overpriced.. We ordered 2 noodle dishes with vegetable.. No meat.. dumplings (4 dumplings) spring rolls (3 spring rolls) and it came to $85.... We figured it was good because it was recommended to us.. So we were willing to pay if it was enjoyable. The food came and it was terrible. Completely inedible.. We did not even eat any of it except the dumplings. It was extremely dry and had a terrible burnt taste. The noodles were rock solid. we called for a refund and the lady did not help at all. I definitely do not recommend."}
{"text":"Again, coming from Toronto, this place falls short of what Toronto has.  Most places in TO will have specialty dim sum dishes that sets them apart from others but,  this place had nothing special.   

We were there for about 1. 5 hr, waiting for duck feet and beef tripe.   Restaurant they not serve those items for some reason. Not many dessert items at all. 

But food was not that bad... if I was in mood for dim sum and in the Montreal area,  I guess I would come back.

Price was reasonable I guess."}
{"text":"Service slow, food not very good, waiter rude, had to ask busboy for food, and drinks. When bill came, waiter very argumentive because we gave the tip to the busboy, not him. Owner then got into a argument with our host who paid the bill. Our host had been there a few years earlier, but now will never go back."}
{"text":"I have yum cha here about once a month. The portions are quite and good and the food is generally consistent. There is no rhyme or reason in the order that they bring out the food and sometimes you find yourself waiting 30 minutes for a dish to come out. But that's all part of the yum cha experience."}
{"text":"All in all, this was a pretty disappointing dim sum experience.  They do carts as well as ordering, so we sat down and placed an order of a few dishes.  It took a really long time for our order to come out, and by that time what we had ordered had come out on carts already.  The food was alright, certainly not spectacular in comparison to other dim sum places in other cities.  The service was standard, but we had to ask for water and tea, as well as our check."}
{"text":"This review is only for the dim sum service.

Food: Average Dim Sum selection, pretty standard and decent food quality, nothing outstanding but always a safe option I would say

Service: Varies depending on how busy they are, but fairly quick usually and the food carts come around quickly.

Price: Average price

Ambiance: Can get really packed and loud during the busiest hours, which is expected from such a restaurant. Bonus: despite the restaurant being fairly busy, the tables still have fair space between them."}
{"text":"I go there from time to time for a lunch. It is decent for a good price.
I always take the dim sum they serve on trolleys rolling between the tables, and it is OK.
Sometimes you have to be creative to understand the name of the food they try to tell you either in English or in French, so better ask to look at the dim sum and point the ones you want.
The place is big, packed with Chinese people who seem happy to be there which is a good sign.
To try this type of dim sum restaurant, you'd better know what you want to eat on carts. If you pick up randomly, you can end up with a really bad experience.
Not everything is good for a north American palate.
If you are not sure you can ask for a menu, but you won't get easily what is on the karts.
I usually eat quite a lot for 20$ something for 2, and I keep coming back once a month or so.
Every time I go there, I try something new on the carts; I must admit I don't always appreciate the new stuff, but that's part of the game."}
{"text":"Great dimsum!! So surprised to get such good dimsum here... It's better than those I tried in Boston and Chicago, and even Shanghai. Must go especially if you like shrimps!"}
{"text":"Service was not to par, bordering to poor. Food is just so so, not the best as depicted by some of the reviews. This restaurant is probably set up for banquets and not for dining experience. Skip it and find some place else."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Worst attitudes ever. DO NOT COME HERE!!"}
{"text":"The food was half descent, but they were completely intolerant of the fact that I spoke English (I'm from out of town) and seemed very hostile and intolerant."}
{"text":"Acceptable mediocre dim sum place. Not very good but somehow decent. That's what you can have for dim sum restaurant in Montreal. You won't be surprised no matter in a good or bad way."}
{"text":"The BBK pork buns and ginger tofu desert are my favorites. Too bad they have the WORST service I have experienced in my life.

Service was never great to begin with: they don't speak french, make very few efforts with english, make you feel like they don't care and don't have time for you, almost as if they'd prefer you not to come. But today was the icing on the cake and they lost 4 regular customers.

The 2 decomposing dead fishes in the kitchen aquarium were shocking enough but the reaction and lack of respect we got when we told them about it was even more disturbing and disgusting. We were told that humans die every day, that it's part of life. Well sure but we don't let them rot in public to cook and serve them later. We were told that we did not have any respect for ourselves (makes no sense in this context btw) but what about the respect you have for us?

Very inhumane experience in every way.
Will never recommend again."}
{"text":"I agree with a lot of reviews for this place, it's not the best dim sum you'll ever have (especially if your from San Fran, Toronto or NYC) but it's definitely not bad at all. The variety of dim sum is limited but you don't mind it so much once you see how quick and prompt the service is which says a lot since they had long lines of people waiting for a table before and after we left."}
{"text":"The foods were just okay. Why are there no good chinese restaurants in Montreal? This is ridiculous! One time we had no choice but to share the tables with a wedding and we thought we were a part of the wedding guests. Their foods are also quiet expensive too."}
{"text":"if you're in Montreal and want stellar Hong Kong Chinese food in Chinatown, go to La Maison Kam Fung.  I came here with my parents for dinner and it was the best Cantonese food they've had since leaving Hong Kong for Boston in 1983.  We feasted but the lobster dishes were most memorable - one was ginger and shallot and the other was spicy salt & pepper.  I don't think I have ever seen my parents so happy.  We always talk about how on our next trip here we will have dim sum and dinner here every day.  Now that Montreal is on Yelp, that return trip may be sooner than later."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now, and really like it. The food is nice and so is the hectic lunchtime crowd. Great classics like bao and shumai. For the price it's worth it to sit down and eat some dumplings and other appetizers. Many of the dumplings were not available in the breakfast hours, but they still had a few along with sesame balls and tea. That is a great combination to start off any day."}
{"text":"I ate here twice in two weeks, once at night and once for dim sum.

I rarely come here for dinner, because dinner here is not to my liking. From chow mein to mayo shrimp to war sui gai, everything is average.

The Dim Sim though is another story, I usually come here for dim sum, it's well done. the dumplings are flavorful. Mtl dim sum is quite sad compared to vancouver and san Francisco, in terms of variety. In terms of variety it's not great but for what they make they make it well. I ate well for dim sum :) and the carts here pass often so the wait is not too long before you find something you like. They refill the tea quite quickly here, 

tip: once your teapot is empty just flip the lid and they'll come to refill it for you :) it works in all chinese restos..."}
{"text":"The place is crowded for dim sum, but it's worth the wait. For supper, it's a little bit expensive, but the food is great and it's comfortable."}
{"text":"We love this place. We love the food. I ordered pork strips and sea food basket.
We ate all out food and then some. I drove from Tupper lake just to eat this quality food."}
{"text":"I don't know what each dish is called but they taste great

 Chinese food, what's not to love? I recently went to 'La Maison Kam Fung' in Montreal's Chinatown for dim sum where food trolleys are carted around serving an array of tapas-sized dishes (think of an Asian buffet that comes to your table) consisting of dumplings, meat & seafood, noodle dishes, soups, traditional deserts & teas.  Weekends are of course busy and I've been here many times, however the most recent time; some of the food didn't taste as fresh, how it normally tastes, possibly because the carts were slightly slower traveling through the busy restaurant.   Some dishes were room temperature and cool, when they were supposed to be warm. The spring rolls that I ordered were the best tasting items of the day. The staff-members seem have two modes of services, happy and jolly, or they walk around looking like they dread working there. Nonetheless, the waitresses and waiters who served my table were friendly even though they could barely speak English. Overall, the experience is unique to the Chinese culture and this is one of the better places for dim sum."}
{"text":"Hum....it is ok dim sum not really authentic but the service is quick and friendly. I went there early before 11AM when we left it became crowned. Good place for a large group."}
{"text":"We were craving some dim sum during our visit to Montreal and were shocked that there were so few places. The reviews on Yelp/Google were dicey, but we decided to take a chance on Kim Fung anyway. The restaurant's entrance is in a small mall and there's signage both in/outside to help you locate it. We visited on Friday around 11AM - it wasn't crowded so we were seated immediately. The food carts came around very frequently and the food was fresh and delicious. They served pretty basic dim sum - har gow, shrimp noodles, spring rolls, shu mai, etc. The check was a little pricey, but we ate a ton of food. They didn't hound us for a tip, but they did ask how much change we wanted back. Overall, it was a pretty similar experience to many of the NYC dim sum places we go to."}
{"text":"The best way to experience dim sum is with a pack of your best friends!

Go (early!!) for a weekend lunch. Be adventurous and try everything (and yes, that means the chicken feet and tripe, too!). But definitely get the siu mai, har gow, potstickers and eggplant... even the pickiest of your party should find something to enjoy here."}
{"text":"Decent dim sum.. stars deducted for difficulty finding entrance. Service was okay.  Address of restaurant was different from entrance of restaurant.. total confusion at first."}
{"text":"This place they will server you immediately upon arrival and within seconds food carts are at your table. Servers are super attentive and the food are one of the best thus far that we had tried. We been to a lot of dim sum places when we travel and this can easily be one of our favorites. Portion size are substantially larger but quality and flavors are superb."}
{"text":"Really inexpensive, good quality.  Better than any dim sum I've had in San Francisco (and I've made the rounds there).  The custard and coconut buns are highly recommended, as is the vegetarian noodle bowl."}
{"text":"Kam Fung is a place for someone looking to eat like a wolf and pay like a miser. As it's always full of Chinese patrons, it must be worth a try.

Do not come in a party smaller than 4. You will be seated at a small table in the corners or at a large table with other patrons. 

Pay cash!

You have to think ahead and get the dim sum when the cart goes by. The place is huge and the cart ladies are busy, so you might wait 10 minutes between dim sum carts. I steer away from the heavier-sauced stuff they offer and stick to dim sum and a few fried dishes.

I agree with other reviewers who say the food isn't exactly pure Chinese or the best meal of your life. But it's good food and excellent value.

All in all one can expect to stuff one's face and spend $15 or thereabouts, depending on the expensiveness of your taste."}
{"text":"On Sunday I came here with my family to try the their food. We were there at 10:30 and the line weren't long and we got our number. When we got our number we asked how long do we need to wait. They told us about 20 minutes. We waited for an hour. We told them we been here and have been waiting for a long time for our number to be call. They said we need to wait. As we were waiting I notice that they skipped our number to call on other numbers with the same number of party as our. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone since they are treating customers unfairly. Base on the service of customer if I have I choice of 0 star I would totally give it this restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant is on the second floor of a building on the edge of Chinatown, which is small, just a few blocks.  We came just as the lunch crowd left so we didn't have a problem getting a table.  We had seafood dumplings, greens, mango gelatin dessert, noodles, and some things I'm not sure of, but we ate it anyway. Overall, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Came here with my fiancee. We were told that this was the best chinese restaurant. Ok, let me preface by saying that although I am from Toronto, I will try to be as objective as possible in this review. To start, the food was tasty. I mean I cannot complain because the food was pretty good. That is where the trouble begins. Later that night, my fiancee had the... ahem, the runs... which then continued the next couple of days along with the cramps. I should have realized that something like this was going to happen cause at the end of the meal I went to use the bathroom, and I was appalled at the conditions. I mean, I am not expecting a 5 star hotel bathroom, but maybe a cleaning of the bathroom once a century would spruce the place up. Don't go unless you need to purge your system for a nice cleansing before a colonoscopy."}
{"text":"Very very decent Chinese food, not Toronto quality but definitely better than any plaCE in NYC. We got the 4 dish set plus some salted egg shrimp. The portions were very big and seasoned very much to our tastes. And the fish was excellent, it's rare that any restaurant can get it steamed perfectly and they come pretty close. Returned also for dim sum...which was only OK. This is definitely a good dinner spot."}
{"text":"Pas mal pour ceux qui n'ont jamais essayé Dim Sum, il offre des plats de base comme des ravioli aux crevettes, bouille de riz etc. Mais pour moi des plats pas assez abondants. Il avait beaucoup de clients donc les employés parfois nous ignorent."}
{"text":"The staff here have a mix of people who can speak Chinese Mandarin and Cantonese, as well as both English/French; so whether you are unilingual/bilingual/chinese speaking only, you'll feel quite welcome here. Be aware that Montréal is a very cosmopolitan city!.... the staff here will assume you know how to use chopsticks, you have to specifically ask if you want a fork.

For Dim Sum brunch, they have the usual classics, their Har Gao, Shui Mai, Bao, Congee, Honeyed Tofu, and Hong Kong style Egg Tarts are excellent.  If you coming for brunch on the weekend, arrive before 09:00AM or you'll be seating in one of the *eight* benches outside the restaurant waiting for a table!  The Dim Sum themselves are served both ways, you can order using a checklist, or you can graze as carts come by your table. In addition to the classic Jasmine tea, they also serve Oolong, you just have to specifically ask for it.  Don't by shy either about specify which table you would like to sit at either, they're sometime a bit disorganized when it comes to seating customers.

Outside of brunch hours, they also have a full menu: a simple but very good selection is getting a duck with a platter of singapore style vermicelli and a platter of young-chou style fried rice. Delicious! The prix fixé combo menu is decent, but you should really explore the à la carte menu, there are lots of gems to discover there."}
{"text":"Bien acceuillant ! Service rapide!
On y mange très bien, les vapeurs sont excellents( Ha Cau, crepes aux crevettes...,) vous êtes pas arnaqués!
Prix raisonnables.Sur une semaine à Montréal, on y est allé manger 3 fois là.
Très bien servi! Les dames qui poussent les chariots sont très serviables.
Je vous conseille ce resto!"}
{"text":"I visited Montreal for a music festival and was lucky enough to be staying at the Travelodge on the edge of Chinatown.  The view was beautiful, the late night teahouses were amazing, and the food was stellar.  On our last day, we decided to have some delicious dim sum, so we go here early with a party of eight.  

The location is excellent since it is in a climate controlled mall, so if there is a wait you can walk around to keep yourself entertained with many of the wonderful shops.  The restaurant itself is on one of the upper floors, so try to sit by the window for a beautiful view.  The service was fast and friendly, but the dim sum was so-so.  We ordered all of the standards like Gai Lan, Har Gow, and Rice Crepe.  Prices were really low at the time, because the dollar was stronger then.

I come from Tampa, FL so having dim sum on cart just makes me really happy.  My experience here was wonderful and exciting, and I hope to return at least once a year."}
{"text":"My favourite place for Dim Sum or Yum Cha if you prefer. There are line-ups, so be aware that you will have to stand or sit and wait. Particular nice are the peanut dumplings and rice in lotus leaf. The carts will tend to bypass you if you aren't Asian with some of the dishes. If you do want them, you will need to call them over for them, if you want them. I guess they are getting used to people making a face when they are offered chicken feet :)

There are a number of seats that aren't optimal, so be ready to ask to be wait longer if you aren't flexible. In particular there are two tables near the kitchen where you are sort of in a corner as well as one near the door that of course has everyone walk past."}
{"text":"Not easy to find but well worth the search. We walked up and down Rue Saint-Urbain. It took a few passes to realize it was inside a large building upstairs. We went for dim sum and it was really quite tasty. 
We ordered the following dishes served off the carts:
1.) Chinese broccoli
2.) Hai Gow
3.) Shiu Mai
4.) Duck feet wrapped in Soy bean 
5.) Scallop dumplings
6.) Black Bean ribs
7.) Shrimp & chive dumpling

All the food came out hot and delicious. The service was good, tea refilled quickly and the prices reasonable."}
{"text":"I have been sent on a quest for Dim Sum.  This is Serious Business.

I'm wearing my travel digs:  White t-shirt, gray unstructured sport coat, black pleated slacks.  Oakley Crosshair 2.0 wraparounds complete the look, which is somewhere between polished and menacing.  Gradually my relative size to the people around me starts to increase as I walk past hair salons that reek of \"the Greener grass\" effect, herbal dispensaries that have linked cancer to sexual power and cured both with dried ground endangered species.  Gradually I'm a full foot and change taller than almost everyone around me, and one of a very few non-oriental race members.  I narrow my eyes behind my sunglasses, and the sea parts long enough for me to get a number in reply to my \"one, for lunch\" request.

  Time passes.  My number is called and It's time to dine.  I'm seated near the glass wall by the menu, and for a brief delusional moment I think this means the carts will not make it to me in a timely fashion.

  The carts start arriving being shoved by Chinese women who equate the turn of my head with a leaping embrace, a bellow of joy, and a hissing demand for a slightly larger portion than normal while my fingers grip their hair tightly.  After five fast dishes I am literally terrified to move, but I'm managing to smile and shake my head \"no\" which seem to tell them to \"invoke the hurt sobbing of a spurned lover and plead piteously.\"  Two more plates arrive in this manner, and I realize how alone I am just now.  While I am no virgin, there's only so much that will fit.

  As for the food -- at some point I'm pretty sure dim sum offerings are sent out just to mess with you.  It starts normally enough, with known offerings and expected pleasures.  \"Shrimp dumplingShuMaiYouWantYes?\"  Soon, however \"CatKidneyPoachedSquidInkYes?\" Umm... \"CrispyPorkMarinated-\" so far so good \"UterusWithGarlicYes?\" *Wince, ponder* \"Bring It.\"  Eyes glance over and money exchanges hands, and the next round of betting on what will the gwai-low eat next begins.  There's an old Chinese woman grinning like I just won her rent money, so the last couple of dishes (what am I up to.. eight?) I take her advice.  She winds up laughing with me and we split the last dish of whole fried prawns, which we eat heads, tails and all.  Without being able to speak to eat other we have tea as annoying children pound on the glass wall we're both seated against -- at one moment we communicate clearly, however.  The child's antics crescendo, and we both fix the beastie with Death Glares.  He looks at both of us, pales, and runs to his mother's terrified arms.  The old woman and I meet eyes, and I think \"dead before he hits the ground\" and she answers \"and then prepared in the classic manner with fermented bean paste, garlic, hot chili oil and scallions.\"  

  Thin smiles, and then it's time to go.  I will miss Montreal, and especially this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my most favorite chinese restaurant in the entire world! 

Whether you go here for a brunch or a proper menu, your tummy will enter heaven my friend!

I recommend especially these, ORANGE CHICKEN (from the menu), a blast even for those who hate sweet versions of meat. My boufriend is a total sweet hater but since the time I forced him to taste it he never orders anything else at Kam Fung. Crunchy dim sums filled with prawns served with sweet chilli sauce are amazing as well. Make sure you also try their noodles. Ah-men or amen, whatever, it is truly a miracle.

The brunch is not only a delicious treat but also an immensely great adventurous experience. Just make sure to order everything you see, otherwise you'll regret later. Plus it is superbly cheap, a meal around $3-$7. :-)

La Maison Kam Fung, you will always be my number one on my chinese restaurants list no matter what!"}
{"text":"We had a great dim sum lunch experience here this weekend!

There were about 20 people waiting outside when we arrived, so I thought that Andrew and I would have to wait for half an hour or more to get in, but to our surprise, we were seated right away in a small anteroom with several small tables and two large ones. A waiter brought us a pot of tea and forks/knives for Andrew, too.

I had dim sum with my family all the time growing up so I knew what I was doing, but Andrew was a little startled and put off by the nature of the service, especially when two cart-pushers got into a traffic jam near our table and shouted at each other. It's all part of the chaotic, fast-paced dim sum experience, though. I got us rice sheet rolls with bbq pork, shumai (shrimp/pork/mushroom), hakow (shrimp), pork potstickers, and eggplant stuffed with shrimp. Everything was extremely yummy and we were full after only 15 minutes! We didn't feel pressured to leave when we were done (nor, apparently, did the folks at the table next to us, who sat without food, discussing TMI health problems for the entire time we were there).

You really don't need to speak Chinese to eat here--I don't--the servers call out the names of their dishes in English, and you can hold up your fingers to say how many you'd like, or just point and nod. No pressure to take anything you don't want to--just shake your head or avoid eye contact altogether. At the end, wave to one of the waiters and they add up your stamp card and ring you up at your table. It was $22 + tip for the two of us--not bad at all, considering how much food and the variety of dumplings we got!

It was definitely comparable to many dim sum restaurants I've been to in the San Francisco area! Next time it might be nice to come with more people, so we can try more dishes between us plus some of the stuff from the menu, but we'd also probably have to wait longer. When we left, there were probably 40 or 50 people waiting to be seated!

Yum yum yum. Now back to Burlington, to dream of dim sum until our next Montreal visit."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good considering we're in Montreal.  Shrimp/meat all taste fresh to me, and flavors are on point for all the dishes.  Quality and quantity are authentic.  

Pictures are accurate to what you get.  Price is reasonable for most items, except noob-traps that real foodies wouldn't order.  If you have no chinese friends, then just order whatever the chinese people in the next table orders.  Service is traditional dim sum: no pampering of guests.  They push the karts around and you \"dim\" (pick) what your \"sum\" (heart) desires.   If you want your ego to be fondled, you need to go else where.

Problem i see in low score reviews here seems to be... moronic noobs speaking out of place.  If you think shumai is supposed to be tiny microwaved sht that taste like moosh, then you accused authentic shumai to be too dense... lmao.  Also, they stamp/add to your bill when dishes are served, and when finished dishes are taken away, the stamp on your bill stays cuz you haven't paid yet.  Jim H. made foolish judgement without realizing this simple and obvious fact."}
{"text":"I stopped by here for lunch when I was in Montreal for a conference. I thought the dim sum here was absolutely delicious. It is reminiscent of the dim sum I had in Hong Kong. I only ordered about three plates (it was only me *sad face*) but I will definitely visit again when I return to Montreal."}
{"text":"Great dim sum on a rainy Wednesday afternoon. Staff was friendly/polite to English speakers. Really enjoyed roasted pork bun."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday right before 11 am and were seated right away. By 11:15am there was a long line.

Ambiance: Large yet tight (all the tables are very close together). Bathrooms are tiny. There was some guy puking in the sink in the guy's bathroom.

Service: We weren't even served water or asked if we wanted to purchase drinks. We saw some waiters speaking English to other tables but they would barely acknowledge us. At one point it felt like we were being dismissed because we were the only brown people in there. We go to New York Chinatown all the time and never felt the way we did at this place.

Food: Honestly, nothing that stood out to us. Some of the dumplings were okay. Many of the carts didn't even come our way. Half the time they don't tell you what's in it. For example, they assured us one dish was just pork, not shrimp, but we found shrimp in it. This is dangerous for someone with allergies.

This was the second Chinese restaurant we visited in Montreal and I have come to the realization that Chinese food in Montreal is mediocre compared to Chinese food in New York."}
{"text":"In this review, I am only going to talk about their dim sum.

I absolutely loved it. The service was very friendly and personal, and I was really happy with the suggestion of the waitress for the Cantonese Sponge Cake. It was not too sweet and it was very fluffy.

Their steamed short ribs was also a delight, and thoroughly cooked.

The decor and the ambience was mediocre. They have traditional carts and the menu to order your dishes from. The only downside of the place is that some items from their dim sum menu were not available until noon."}
{"text":"Flavor was ok. There was not a wide selection of food to choose from. As we were walking out we noticed that tables closer to the exit had more variety of food on their tables. Maybe the food offerings depend on where you sit. Trip advisory has 4 out of 5 stars, if that's the best they have, then it's not very good."}
{"text":"Really good and solid dim sum. Staff is polite, they speak English, French, and Chinese. The place is located in what looks like a mall, do not let that deter you. I've been to a couple of other dim sum spots in Montreal and this is my favorite."}
{"text":"My, oh my. This dim sum was not the greatest to say the least. The food was extremely oily and the service wasn't that great. The waiters kept on trying to force food on us even though we kept on saying no. Their egg tarts were not crispy at all and to compensate for that it was overly sweet. Their baked BBQ pork buns were cold and too sweet as well. Their sticky rice in bamboo leaves was decent. Their pork dumplings were very greasy and a bit overcooked. Their fried squid was not crispy or hot at all. Their mango pudding was ok, but a bit too sweet. Their sesame ball sticky rice dessert was mediocre. Their selection was decent and the waiters were quick with bringing their carts over. It was very cheap for dimsum. It's cheaper to pay in cash. I went with a group of 11 people and each of us paid $13 including tip. If you miss dim sum you should come here. 
PS. They don't have a spin table on the table, so you will have to pass the food from person to person."}
{"text":"Simply awesome place, good service, not great but friendly enough. Dim Sum crowds a plenty which means you know the food is yummy to the last bite, ofcourse according to personal taste. I love anything Chinese especially Dim Sum. Anyways it was my bff's birthday so I thought I take her to a Sunday brunch in Chinatown, can't go wrong taking a Chinese girl to Dim Sum , truth is was just as much for me as it was for her lol. Food was excellent , fresh, luke warm to hot, and plenty of choices. My Dim Sum go to restaurant for this local girl."}
{"text":"Sucks! Everything was either too dense or mushy. Chicken feet didn't taste good. Ribs were chewy. Noodles were mushy and fell apart, Shumai was dense and chewy.
Worst dim sum I've ever had."}
{"text":"Pour une expérience dépaysante, c'est le lieu où aller ! 

Petit conseil, amenez-y quelqu'un qui s'y connaît un peu. Les chariots passent à une vitesse incroyable et la prononciation est un peu difficile. Les serveuses parlent la plupart du temps un anglais avec un accent chinois, et parfois français. Il est donc un peu difficile parfois de savoir exactement ce que vous mangez !

Dumplings et compagnie : excellent ! C'est à essayer et à y retourner une fois de temps en temps."}
{"text":"Excellent dim sum.  Courteous service.  Will definitely return the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Was not at all impressed by the dim sum here. Compared to Boston, NYC, Toronto, and Vancouver, it was pretty sub par. The food was hot and the carts came around quickly, which was nice. But other than that, the ha gau was fishy-tasting, the loh baak go was gummy, and the dou fu fa was very firm and not silky. The service is as you'd expect from a dim sum restaurant -- the staff mostly speaks Chinese and is brusque, no surprises there."}
{"text":"Decent dim sum, adequate service, really good prices!  The carts came around pretty often.  You have to wait for your actual server if you want anything extra like more hot sauce.  Five of us were well stuffed for $11 each including a decent tip.  We got there at 11am and were seated right away.  When we left the hallway was packed with people holding numbers waiting for their tables.  Get there early on Sunday if you don't want to wait!"}
{"text":"**?Health and Safety Warning?** This restaurant was incredibly questionable to begin with. Several of my friends complained about extremely rude wait staff who refused to give them water. The food handling was very unhygienic and I saw waitstaff picking food off the ground and putting it back on the cart for customers. Be aware!! They also made a large noise and screamed at a table beside us, and refused to apologize for our uncooked pork dumplings. Very hard pass"}
{"text":"Stopped in here with a large party and were able to order in Cantonese. 

We had

Yam cake
Shu Mai
Fried veggie dumpling 
Char siu bao
Tripe
Chive pancake
Fried something  with mayo

All the typical dim sum stuff. All of it was good. the chive pancake, recommended by our server, was excellent.

This seems to  be the go-to dim sum place in Montreal; we had to wait, but not too long, for a table. Service was efficient.

We've had both better and worse dim sum. This place is okay and we would go back."}
{"text":"Sitôt assis autour des grandes tables rondes, une multitude de dames débarquent avec leurs chariots remplis de dimsum, qui seront facturés à l'assiette sur une facture commune. J'aurais aimé vous dire ce que j'ai mangé précisément, mais ce ne sera malheureusement pas possible ! La plupart des dimsum sont faits avec des pâtes wonton farcies de viande, de légumes et/ou de fruits de mer, cuits à la vapeur ou frits. Il y a aussi des boulettes de viandes, du riz frit au poisson, des nouilles chinoises, des gâteaux blancs farçis de viande, des brocolis chinois et du tofu frit. En dessert, de délicieuses petites tartelettes aux oeufs, encore chaudes."}
{"text":"Came in here on Sun morning of the long weekend. Service was prompt and food was served hot and fresh. Would definitely come back here again"}
{"text":"The best Dim Sum in Mintreal, probably the best in Quebec. Nice hospitality, everyone smiles. Comfortable sunny dining place. A new branch in Brossard too, even larger and convenient parking."}
{"text":"Saw roaches crawling. Their fish tank is not clean as some of their fish are swimming upside down. 
There is a lot of fried and oily food. The quality and taste is fair. 
I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"I just got craving once a while for dim sum. This place is decent to have dim sum as brunch with friends and family. People here are very friendly. And it's not too bad for a Monday, I got everything I wanted to eat. You can't compare this to those fancy dim sum places in Toronto ( I mean look at the price), but the food and service are more than fair for their price."}
{"text":"Wow.  Three words say it all: Peking Duck Heaven."}
{"text":"not very professional. The Chinese broccoli has some weird taste and the beet cake has the flour like texture which is not supposed to have."}
{"text":"Came here on an early Friday morning, staff was very friendly and helpful, the food came out fast and probably some of the best dim sum I've ever had in Montreal.  I like the fact that it's open at 7am and even though it's located in a small strip plaza on the second floor (hard time finding it at first) it's well worth the price...you'll go home full and happy."}
{"text":"Good dim sum and a great deal. The atmosphere is standard dim sum restaurant (nothing fancy) but the value of the deal makes up for it."}
{"text":"The wait was 15 minutes on a Sunday morning. I came from NYC to visit Montreal for the weekend and I was quite disappointed. A lot of the food was pretty greasy and didn't taste as amazing as the typical places I go to in NYC. I don't remember much else except that. However, service was good as my table was never skipped and they had what we wanted. I would come back if I needed a dim sum fix in Montreal though."}
{"text":"My delivery order placed through vvvv arrived in time and hot. Great food -- very good quality and quantity. Packaging could be better, but I'll definitely re-order from them (delivered by A La Carte Express / alce.ca)."}
{"text":"Une institution à montréal. Enorme restaurant chinois. Menu du soir super abordable (reviens a 10$ par personne). Ils proposesnt des menus pour 2 à 40$ qui est en réalité pour 4 personnes. Bouffe délicieuse. Formule dim sum le midi. A ne pas manquer!"}
{"text":"The dim sum is big and good. The price has gone through the roof. The dishes are between 4 and 5.50 for 3 or 4 dumplings."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE. This used to be my favourite restaurant in 2008 and prior, but when i returned in 2009 it had gone SEVERELY DOWNHILL. the service and food were HORRIBLE. our waiter was rude and unhelpful and upon serving us the INCORRECT dishes, he refused to return them. the \"fresh fish\" was not only not fresh but it was near-rotten and had a pungent old odor. when we asked to exchange it for the fresh sea bass, instead of exchanging it they gave us a fresh sea bass and charged us $50. teh bill for 2 people turned out to be $150 due to their negligence and poor service. i will NEVER return to la maison kam fung."}
{"text":"Good fresh dim sum at 1130 am on a Monday. The Shu Mai and Har Gow were both excellent. Not as much selection on the carts as you would normally expect, but it is Monday after all."}
{"text":"The food is excellent but the wait for a table is horrible. It's so unorganized. Expect to be waiting for an hour on the weekend. I love the cart pushing around the restaurant while you are eating."}
{"text":"A very typical Chinese restaurant. We came here for lunch dim sum -- didn't blow me away. The xiao long bao looked non-juicy, and we never saw chicken feet, soy milk, or you tiao carts coming by. 

We were planning to have a large group dinner, but it turns out that the restaurant lost its liquor license for some reason. When we asked whether we could BYOB, we were at first told yes by a sketchy male manager, but then subsequently no and \"get out of here, I'm too busy to answer to you\" by a female manager. 

We did end up having our large group dinner here, and the dishes were either awesome hits (lobster) or grave misses (Peking duck, ma po tofu, seafood soup). The only positive I have to say about this place is that you don't have to wait for seating, even at dinner rush hour, and the food was served reasonably quickly compared to the other restaurants in Chinatown."}
{"text":"I'm of Chinese descent and grew up eating good dim sum, so I was very disappointed with this place.

If this is Montreal's best, I'll just have my dim sum in Toronto or San Francisco. (Haven't been to NYC yet, so I can't comment - but I'm sure it's very good there.)  Quality and taste at Kam Fung were just average at best.  Perhaps it's the best dim sum you can get in Montreal...but going to Montreal for Chinese food is like going to Paris for Mexican.

 (Oh, and my bf ended up getting the runs after.)"}
{"text":"Lots of short tempered ladies pushing trolleys full of tasty dim sum. Delicious and great fun!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why ppl are going crazy over this place. Line is too long for dirty food. The quality of the food is poor. The lady with the cart takes forever to come by. Once they come... they try to give you every thing even when you reject. Since they cannot speak English or French... It's a real struggle to enjoy or ask anything. Even the workers can't really speak proper English or French so it's hard to ask for more tea or water. Eye signal and body language is the way to communicate. For two, we ordered few dishes and our bill came out to be about $35 with tax and tip. We did not finish one dish because it had plastic piece inside of the food... I complained but they said something that I don't understand. They didn't even give us new dish or take the price out of the bill. At the register I asked again but the lady was like idk so just pay. So rude. I give one star bc other food was okay and I don't have other option. Overall, I felt rushed and customer service was horrible. Don't go during weekend. If you like dumpling only go somewhere else. Make sure to do some body language practice before you go."}
{"text":"We came here hoping for some delicious dim sum. They never gave us a high chair for our kid. We ordered 6 plates & the food never arrived. About an hour later they gave us 4 small plates for $23.00. The service was unbelievably terrible. We paid & did not leave any tip & they chased after us outside the door and asked for tips. We explained to them about their horrendous service & food quality, and left.

Please don't waste your time or money at this place. It's a business and not a restaurant. They were more interesting in seating you right away and getting your money rather than sharing any quality food or service. It truly was disappointing for us."}
{"text":"Food was fresh, service attentive. Would definitely recommend. The basic dishes are comparable to Dim Sum restaurants in Toronto. The selection is a little on the small side but the basics are all covered. Jasmine tea was not as yummy as most places for some reason. 

The restaurant is pretty clean, not spotless. Real tablecloths is a nice touch."}
{"text":"The waiter yelled at us because he thought my friend undertipped him and said \"do you guys not know the rules? It is Canadian policy to tip 15-20%!\" Then he tried to force us to make up the \"insufficiency\" by cash. His rude behaviour just confirmed he doesn't deserve any tips. I've never seen a restaurant give customer a hard time on tips like they did. Yes you can have your expectations but can you force the customer to tip the amount you want to get? And should you confront the customers if you don't get what you want? So unprofessional, such a disappointment."}
{"text":"This was my favorite Chinese in Montreal. I have been going here 1 - 2 times each year for over 10 years.  Up until last year, i would have rated the food here a 4  to 4.5 stars.  But last year when I went the food did not seam as good.  Just thought it was an off night???

I went again last night and the food was not good.  I rated it overall 3 stars because of the  service.  Theservice was better than in it was in the past.  Service was very efficient.  

I would rate the food last night as 2 stars, the food was bland.  Had Szechuan Shrimp, it was very sweet, no kick at all.  Same with the chicken dish, it seemed to lack spice.  No kick at all.  The Hot n Sour was decent, I liked it, my partner did not.  It did lack \"KICK\".    

Anyway, I hope it was just what i ordered and/or another off night.  AI'll probably give it one more chance before trying another place."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best dim sum in Montreal. As with any dim sum place anywhere, show up early. This goes double for large groups."}
{"text":"Great place but it can get busy often. Highly authentic cantonese cuisine."}
{"text":"Best dim sum I've ever had! Visited Montreal  for a quick weekend trip and we're so happy to check this place out before we left. There was a lot of people but the wait wasn't bad for six people. Keep in mind this place is inside a tiny, dim mall. Really fresh food and you can tell it's fresh out of the oven. Amazing shrimp dumplings and this is coming from someone who eats dim sum all the time in NYC."}
{"text":"This place was so crappy it made me cry. Yes seriously I sat down outside and cried after my boyfriend and I spent 30 bucks on this lousy crap.

If you think this place is even a contender for best dim sum you are deluded. We came here on a Sunday when they arguably should have the best, freshest food available because of the vast amount of diners there are to serve. Sadly, aside from siu mai and har gow my boyfriend and I found ourselves turning away so much cart food. Our usual favorites were few and far between, and instead, we got offered around 8 varietals of dumplings multiple times each.

When we finally did get sticky rice wrapped in banana leaves and another dish that we typically love, they were just straight crappy and super oily.

Never saw tripe, spare ribs, or chicken feet. If I wanted an all dumpling breakfast I'd go to a dumpling restaurant -- this is the key issue here. The secondary issue is the poor quality of ~50% of the food we actually did get. I think the cristal chinois is actually better, although, judging from our last visit to that particular establishment, it's not better by a great deal."}
{"text":"I was attending a conference at the Palais des Congres, which abuts Chinatown, so it made sense to find some good dim sum for lunch. Thanks to Yelp, I found Maison Kam Fung a block away, inside a labyrinthine strip-mallish building. 

After stopping to ask for directions and following my helper to the restaurant, I ended up being seated across a large round table from two businessmen, since I was dining alone.

The restaurant was packed, which gave me hope that the food would be excellent. The gai lan was cooked perfectly, and the server kindly cut it into smaller pieces when asked (I hate gnawing on large chunks of Chinese broccoli). And then there was a cart of food I wasn't interested in. And then there was a very, very long wait before the next cart appeared. In fact, the wait was so long that my tablemates complained to the staff. Finally, another cart appeared. This contained one of the best shrimp fun I've ever tasted.

Then, since I was getting tired of waiting for more food, I stopped a waiter and asked for siu mai, shrimp and chive dumplings, and pork spareribs with black bean sauce. The siu mai was delivered promptly, but I was told to wait for the carts for the rest of the food. In the meantime, I tucked into the siu mai, which were very large but not very good. The ratio of pork to shrimp was off, and it tasted like a pork meatball. 

In the end I gave up waiting for anything else and just got some baked bows wrapped up to go. When I left the table to pay the bill, I put a few dollars down for a tip. At the register the host had the temerity to ask if I'd already left a tip as he handed me my change. I guess he was thinking he should just keep it if I'd been so gauche as to not tip.

Needless to say, that left a very bad taste in my mouth. This was the worst dining experience I had in Montreal. I see no reason to ever return."}
{"text":"I've already said it in another review, but if this is among the best Chinese food Montréal has to offer, then it's a poor reflection of the state of Chinese food in Montréal. 

I was here with my Cantonese parents and we had a large number of dim sum staples like shrimp dumplings (har gow), rice rolls (cheong fun), and fried tofu and eggplant stuffed with shrimp paste. It was all OK, but just not phenomenal. Service was rather... meh, as was the entire venue itself, which looked like a scene straight out of the '80s. 

If this is truly among the best dim sum there is in Montréal, then I guess you'll have to put up with it. But if you get to travel to, say, the Toronto area often, then there are many restaurants in Chinese-heavy suburbs like Markham that will blow this place out of the water."}
{"text":"Every once in awhile, we wake up early enough on a weekend morning to text our friends \"Dim sum at 10?\". If they agree, we always meet at Kam Fung. The earlier the better, because it fills up fast - there's always a long line by the time we leave. I love the steamed shrimp, scallop, and pork dumplings, the BBQ pork buns, and the Chinese broccoli. Washed down with some Chinese tea, it's the perfect antidote to a Friday or Saturday night out."}
{"text":"Wow, there was no line-up on a Saturday at 1:pm! We rolled up and got a table for 3 right away. Then we began selecting what looked good. If I can remember it all, we had: pork and thousand egg congee, har gow, green pepper with shrimp paste, fried pork dumplings, gai lan, bbq pork pastries, fried squid, fried tofu, rice roll with cruller, sesame balls with red bean paste, and soft tofu with ginger sauce. All the items we pretty darn good, but this is a picky point for me: the bathroom was kinda icky! Ugh, a total experience downer."}
{"text":"Stopped here for supper on a Saturday night. The place was busy as could be. The hostess made us come back twice for a table for two and was actually quite rude about it. We ordered a seafood menu for two. The food was good and plentiful though definitely not the best I've had. We had enough for two days though! The decor and atmosphere very basic (not in the Scandinavian sense!) . All in all, a quite average eating experience."}
{"text":"For Montreal this is about as authentic as it can get for 'real' dim sum. I mean it's great after a night out, it's got all the favorites like Har Gow, Shiu Mai, etc.. and like all Dim Sum places, it's always cheaper with more people..."}
{"text":"Used to be the best place in the city for Chinese food.  It doesn't hold that title, but it is still a top Chinese restaurant in Chinatown.

Service is always prompt and professional.  They are also rather friendly and talkative (assuming you speak Chinese).  Still my go-to place for dim sum.

Interesting story... a few years ago on Mother's Day, the entire service staff quit due to differences with management.  That was a hilarious day to go to the restaurant as management was going crazy trying to serve everyone."}
{"text":"Great for dimsum (lunch only)
Service is a bit ruff, sometimes you have the impression that they are through the plates on you to make you leave
I love the deep fry shrimp dimsum and also their crab claw balls"}
{"text":"Check your bill!  

SO and I had a dim sum lunch together.  Food was ok, but the selection was challenging.  They were pushing the fried foods and noodles.  We were looking for more steamed dim sum items.

We noticed several tables around us that had more items show up on their bill than they thought they ordered.  Keep an eye on our check-off list.  The servers attempt to keep it facing away from you.  Make sure the count lines up with your expectations as you go.  

We did not have that problem.  We got to the checkout and the lady actually placed a different amount on the credit card machine that our bill added up to.  It seemed like this was not an accident - when we noticed, she ignored our complaints.  CHECK THE BILL - NOT TRUSTWORTHY."}
{"text":"My friend suggested that we go have lunch here, I hesitated but said yes.  I really enjoyed the experience of the food being served by  carts, they serve table to table. I really enjoyed the BBQ pork and of course Dim Sum dumplings. Service is good!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the better places in Montreal for Dim Sum. But come early and get a number because on the weekends this place is always packed!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here on our F1 trips to Montreal for almost 20 years (gosh next year is 20 and I feel a bit old saying that ). We still love it and the food is great. It's one of the only places that reminds me of my first experience of true dim sum back in Calgary introduced to me by a great Asian friend in the late 70's and I thank him to this day.  

The Cart experience is the deal!  Ordering off a menu does not nearly do it for me but back home in Halifax, it's all I have. (Anyone out there listening should pick this idea up and run with it). You get to choose with your eyes and other senses as the carts filled with their selections roll by. I don't even care I don't speak the language - most of the ladies will explain what it is if you ask - and they open the lids off the steamers or other covered dishes so you can see for yourself. I know almost all of them now but love to see ones I haven't tried. I do have my favourites of course like the Har Gow and Shu Mai and my hubbie's steamed pork buns (char Sui boa) but in the end the duck or chicken feet is my all time favourite.  I've made all of these from scratch but man it's a lot of work and is not the same so you soon appreciate this experience!  Please Halifax get a great place like Kim Fung going!  

It's not cheap but it's so worth it and reminds me in a way of Spain and their Tapas. The selection here is great but to get it all you must be patient and relax; chances are you may still miss a favourite and for me this time it was the black bean spare ribs. Note - you can also order anything off the menu or whatever, I think there are items ordered that only the locals know about and I'm super jealous :).  And I've yet to have room left to try the incredible looking noodle dishes - just gives me something to strive for another tine. 

Last note - take \"home\" what you don't finish; a great snack from your  fridge or freeze and have at home for that great daughter who is pet sitting for you and who at the age of 2 visited her first dim sum restaurant and is also addicted to good and true dim sum like at Kim Fung."}
{"text":"The dim sum plates are quite good but the prices nearly increased by 30% within a year. I recommend taking any dumplings they serve with shrimps."}
{"text":"Oh man, as tourists who had no idea where we were going and no access to maps, it definitely took us awhile to find this place. Which was mainly our fault because we didn't have the exact address. Oops. Based upon what I was seeing on the interent, this was the must-go, best dim sum place in Montreal and my friends and I definitely weren't disappointed.

Very solid dim sum and solid service. My friend decided to bring his container of pork floss... and although it definitely elicited a few strange stares from the waiters and waitresses, we ended up engaging in some pretty hilarious conversation with the people who were there making our dining experience that much more amusing.

We ordered the typical dim sum foods and all of it was excellent by all standards. Three of us are Californians and used to being spoiled with yummy Asian food and Kam Fung's dim sum was excellent. Nothing bad to be said about it. The line does get very long though as it does with most dim sum restaurants, so definitely come early!! We got lucky enough to squeeze right in without a wait, but I would say that the line outside when we finished eating was probably at least an hour wait long.


tldr; excellent dim sum place, a must go if you're craving yummy authentic dim sum in Montreal!"}
{"text":"The food was more like 2.5 stars since I will complain about the lack of egg tarts and variety during a busy Sunday dim sum service.  To their credit, everything was fresh, but we expected more carts given the volume of people there.  We waited about 15 minutes, which seemed odd since the hallway outside Maison Kam Fung was packed.  Service was friendly, though. When we changed our mind about the high chair, they cheerfully took it back.   I'd take this kind of service any day over the kind of service we get in Richmond, BC.  These elements make Maison Kam Fung a 3 star for us.  More shrimp than you can shake a stick out, which was great for our vegetarian member of our party.  Still, I'm baffled why we never saw an egg tart on any of the carts during our hour there.  Maybe we had to special order it through our server."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch with our three children and it was a hit. It was the first time that we took our kids to a Dim Sum restaurant and the kids loved the fact that they could see and choose the food they were going to eat. Some of our favorite dishes were the steamed pork buns, mango pudding, spring rolls, and of course, the dumplings. The total meal for the 5 of us cost about $50.

We walked to Kam Fung after doing the IMAX theater in the old port. it is a hidden gem in a dingy mall and isn't easy to find. We couldn't immediately find the name of the restaurant on the building when we were standing in front of it and the restaurant is upstairs in the mall. 

The staff was also very friendly which is something we were not used to in a Dim Sum restaurant :-)"}
{"text":"We've been here twice on our trips to Montreal, every time has been great. Satisfies our cravings! Finding the location can be a bit confusing so just look for their signs- it is inside a tiny plaza mall.

Food comes out fast and hot. Service is always friendly and accommodating. Prices are reasonable. Always left satisfied and with full tummies.

Will visit again next trip!"}
{"text":"I'm from New York so this doesn't really compare to dim sum places in Flushing but it was pretty good. There were some things that they don't make in New York. The women pushing the carts were very nice. One person we were with knew Mandarin so we were able to communicate better with them. They do speak English though and some speak French so they're trilingual. Cool."}
{"text":"The concept of this restaurant is interesting. You sit down at a table and waiters pass around the tables with trolleys (yes, just like in Harry Potter) and offer different kinds of food. If you are interested, they serve you some and write down on your bill that you ordered this food from this particular category. So your bill will look something like this: 

Three orders from category A at $3,50 = $10,50
One order from category B at $3,00 = $3,00
Total: $13,50

(I am paraphrasing the concept. Don't ask what categories A or B are about. This is just an example off the top of my head) 

The way the receipt is made makes you think what you ordered will cost a lot but actually it is the opposite, especially if you split the bill with someone. It becomes one great bargain. 

My friend and I ordered six things: 2 types of dumplings, potatoes with shrimp, octopus, salt and pepper shrimps, and dessert. 

I remember seeing a trolley of rice, vegetables, boiled dumplings, shrimps and miscellaneous. 

Overall, the food was really good. I discovered new things that I had never heard about and thus I cannot describe their quality. What I can say about the salt and pepper shrimps, since I could eat them every day, is that they were cooked with the shell. Even though it is super healthy to eat the shell once in a while (according to my Chinese friend), I am not a fan. Also, since it is fried with the shell, make sure to eat the shrimps quickly otherwise the shell gets is hard again. 

Our total bill was $24,50 with tip, which makes it $12,50. 
Good food + an entire meal below $15 (with taxes and tips) = I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Situated on saint-urbain street, it's one of the most popular restaurant in Chinatown in my opinion. It's hidden in the building; prepare to get lost going there. Hint: it's on the second floor.
We went there for dim sum; which is basically Chinese brunch. It's small ready to serve dishes; mostly steamed and fried food. Almost always served with tea.
We had pretty much all the good stuff of dim sum. We had the fried dough and the shrimp wrapped in rice noodle. Shaomai; which are steamed dumplings with pork and prawns. Shrimp dumplings, tofu skin rolls which is exactly what it sounds like with pork fillings, fried tofu filled with shrimp, and stir fried noodles. We also shared congi which is basically a rice soup. Everything was just delicious! I'm a dim sum lover person so I might be biased.
They also have a variety of dessert but we were so full after. We just took some egg tart.

Now you might ask how much did all this cost? They charge you per dishes you take but trust me everything is very cheap. We were 8 people and it ended up 13$ per person. 

PS: if it's your first time going for dim sum. I suggest you bring your Asian friend or someone who has been to dim sum. The waiters/waitresses are friendly but their English/French are not the best and sometimes it's hard to understand. So having that one friend can help a lot. Especially if they know what's good or not :P"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant de ChinaTown.
Prix raisonnable vue les quantités assez grosses de chaque plats.
Le canard de pékin avec ses petites crêpes est une de leur spécialité. Dim sum aussi, un immense choix tous savoureux. Il y a toujours du monde même un Lundi soir... restaurant presque plein! Service rapide et efficace."}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant and were given order form and pencil and we ordered some of the dim sum that we ordinarily like to have.    Soon after, little by little, some of the food carts start to appear and we would have much preferred to order directly from these carts since you order exactly what you see.     

Where is this concept of customer service to greet and inform guests that we can use these order forms, in addition to ordering directly from the food carts that would be passing by?    Do we need to spell out that little ones cannot use chopsticks and need a fork instead?  Big sigh...

On a positive note, we requested to have our paper order cancelled and were pleasantly surprised that our waiter told us that was the right move, and rushed to the kitchen to ensure that our orders get voided. 

Everything that we picked up from the food cart were delicious and well prepared, but then again, this is what is expected from a dim sum restaurant as we would not be expecting anything less. 

Although our table was great, It appears that some of the other tables are in a more strategic spot, and less effort is needed to make yourself noticed in order that the food cart finds its way to you.   So, next time I will scout the dining area before getting seated."}
{"text":"Should be one of the most decent places in Chinatown but if you are expecting to eat good Chinese food then it will be difficult to find this in montreal. It's incomparable to Toronto or Vancouver. 

If you want a banquet style or family style Chinese dinner then this is a decent place but only compared to other places in montreal. I would recommend that if you were to pick a place to come here for that. Pretty good fish and vegetables.

If you want dimsum then this is a fun place to come to with the carts and people. The shrimp tasted it's been in the freezer for awhile and the egg tarts were ice cold.

In summary, still recommend to come here for one of the better Chinese cuisines in montreal."}
{"text":"I love dim sum! They have big variations of dishes. They come non stop with million choices. I love flat noodle with beef and crab claws:-))
It also super cheap - Each dish 4-5$."}
{"text":"My family and I came up here with another family for dim sum on Labor Day.  We drove all the way from Burlington, VT.  It was well worth the drive!  We arrived around 11:30am.  They sat our party of 8 right down (although I think normally there is a wait time because of how popular it is).  The place was packed.  The dim sum carts came by regularly enough to keep your mouth watering.  My only complaint is that it is very confusing who your specific waiter is because a variety of servers are walking around.  I did make a special request for two young kids in our party who just wanted white rice and chicken.  They cooked that up for us, but it took some time.  Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"This is considered the go-to place for dim sum in Montreal. 
And have no fear, this place accepts credit and debit as well. 

I was here on a wonderful Monday afternoon, belly completely prepared for the onslaught of meat and dim sum for I did not have breakfast (not an unusual circumstance for me). Though it's no all-you-can-eat, this place really feels like one. Chinese waitresses come around with carts of various dishes, among which you make a selection (if you wish), as though you're at a street vendor. But I advise you to come with someone who speaks Chinese, if you obviously do not know the language, because these waitresses will not be giving you the equivalent English names of the Chinese names of their delicious wares. 

My personal favourites were the dim sum (no surprise) and the fried noodles. Pretty much everything there had a unique flavor that was good enough to help you devour the entire piece. According to my half-Chinese friend, best way to end a meal there is to have a plate of jello. Their jello is very refreshing and they offer two flavours: mango and coconut. As I detest coconut, we went with mango. He was right! It was very refreshing and I would be more than happy to take some home with me. But we ended up eating it all here. We also ordered the egg tarts, and already full by this point, we decided on taking the egg tarts home. 

The two other times that I'd been here, I was in a large group of at least 5 or more. This time it was just me and one other. I was worried that they'd only have the large round tables. To my relief, they had tables for couples, though not many. I had a pleasant time, maybe a little too much pleasure since I stayed here for close to four hours. If you're ever on a date or need to make a quick decision to eat somewhere with one friend, Maison Kam Fung will not disappoint you."}
{"text":"For Montreal dimsum, this place is fairly alright with a wide selection of choices and fairly good service. However, compared with dimsum establishments in the Toronto area, this place really falls short.

Although it usually opens at 7am, when we came on a Sunday morning at 9am, we were surprised to find entire mall empty and the restaurant only had around 2 other tables there - quite a surprise! Even when we left close to 11am, there were fewer than 10 tables in the entire restaurant and the mall was still pretty much empty. When seated, we were given 3 things - an order sheet with the names of the dimsum items in Chinese, not in numerical order, a book-type menu with photos and English, French and Chinese names of the dimsum items, and receipt sort-of sheet for marking off how many dimsum items arrived. 

The food quality was generally poor - many little lumps of fat in their food and very salty food in general. The main saving grace, was that their food was all very hot and freshly made. The biggest annoyance I found was that there was no indication of any dimsum prices. The menu book didn't list the prices, so you had no idea which dimsum item was $4, $4.5, $5, $5.5, $6 and it was dependent on the server to be correct with their dimsum marking.

Also note, if you pay in cash, you get a 15% discount and there's no tea charge like some dimsum establishments in Toronto."}
{"text":"My favourite place to have dim sum in town. Great varieties and fair prices. The waiting line can go crazy sometimes (after 11am mostly) so go early!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the meal! So much food. Started with sweet n sour soup, then fried shrimp dumpling, shrimp dumpling in pasta thingy, crab ball with a claw sticking out, chinese broccoli, sticky rice in lotus leaf. Loved that tasted like comfort food, so yum. fried spring roll, a pork thing I didnt like. Had fatty bits in it. Mango pudding for dessert which was pretty much like jello, which is hilariously fun to wobble. Good atmosphere. Good food. Really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I can't try a new Chinatown without getting dim sum! Get there early since the place gets really packed and you may have to wait in line to get seated. Our wait wasn't too bad and we opted to share a table (typical of big banquet halls). Most of my favorite dim sum fare was available for ordering -- shu mai, har gow, black bean ribs, congee etc. We ended up ordering way more than we should and stuffed ourselves. They are trilingual (English, French, Chinese) and the food carts were always around, so we never had to wait long to order more."}
{"text":"Note: was here recently (August 2014) outside of the popular lunchtime dim sum (before 11am... they open at 7am!) and they give you a menu with photos and English on it to order off of - perfect!

One of the better Chinese restaurants in the city, imo. Very authentic. Unfortunately, the last time we were there, the service was incredibly slow (to start). But the food was great. We had a really delicious clay=pot lamb stew that came with bok choy, bamboo shoots (which I love!), and large shiitake mushrooms. We also tried a snake soup - I've never had that before - which had a nice spicy ginger flavour, and the snake tastes and looks like chicken breast, so don't be put off by that! 
I've been here for dim sum on the weekends as well and I really like it. Lots of choices and traditional dishes.
Best to make a reservation as it gets quite busy."}
{"text":"This place was fun and hectic and worth the wait.  My first dim sum breakfast and while not everything was my cup of tea, I enjoyed what I chose."}
{"text":"Hmm.... my family and I come here each time we're in Montreal, which is pretty annual. We come for dim sum and dinner. Dim sum is just so and so. Not really many choices and the choices aren't super delicious. Enough to fill you up and on your way out.

Dinner is pretty good. The dishes are bigger than we thought, so there were plenty of food. The waiting staff is pretty friendly, one was a bit nosy, but I guess we looked like foreigners."}
{"text":"One of the Best Dim sum houses in Montreal! I'm from NYC and quickly realized how spoiled we are since we have 2 Chinatowns (NYC & QUEENS) So after moving here I asked around where we can have dim sum and was told Ruby Rouge.  Nice large dim sum house but the food was not up to par.  Being chinese and knowing good dim sum you can always tell by a good dim sum house by their \"Har Gow\" ( shrimp dumping)  Sort of like going to a italian restaurant and finding out they can't make a proper plate of spaghetti!   In A har Gow-The Shrimp dumpling rice skin should be soft, moist, silky and the inside should have full perfectly cooked shrimps inside!  
~Fail~ Not what we got at Ruby Rouge! Tough rubbery skin and tasteless over cooked shrimp!  I won't go into the other 3 dishes we ordered... FAIL~

After being disappointed I asked where do all of the local chinese people go to and was told by a shop owner KAM FUNG on the second floor.  We went the next weekend and as packed as it was we did finally get a seat!  The test... Har Gow! Yes.. it was excellent!  Hong Kong quality and the rest of the dishes from the pork dumplings, fried seafood wraps, crispy dumplings, and yes the very difficult to pull off... braised chicken feet!  Impressive for a little dim sum house in Montreal!  I can say that as I'm from Hong Kong!  ...Now you want a 5 star rating?  Go to their sister restaurant  in Brossard! (7209 Taschereau, unit 111, Brossard, QC J4Y 1A1
Phone: (450) 462-7888)  This one gets the full 5 stars!  The decor, design and food are a home run!  I have brought family visiting from NYC & HK and they all have said the food and experience are very Hong kong!  Well done Kam Fung Brossard!  Their hostess Veronica Kwan took it up a notch with her suggestions and her excellent service!  If you can find transportation to Brossard go if not you will enjoy Kam Fung in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Nice dim sum. We came early in the morning so the place is quite empty and only one lady to serve us. It took quite long to wait for the food. The tripe and shrimp dumpling are good. But the rice noodle roll and bbq pork bun are just so so."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE UNLESS YOU SPEAK CHINESE! 
I had high expectation of this place but my experience was just okay. 

We went for dimsum lunch where they bring out carts and we ask for what we would like to have. 
However when I asked for a menu they said they don't have menu for dimsum which was frustrating since I do not know all the Chinese names of their dim-sums. 
Also usually they have pictures or at least simple descriptions of dimsum but this place does not. The server couldn't even understand the word 'shrimp.' When we asked for shrimp she kept screaming out Chinese words we don't understand and she just left our table looking more frustrated than we were! :'( 
So we ended up just ordering few basic dimsums since those are the only ones we were able to explain to them in English. 
The food was good but I wouldn't recommend this place unless you speak fluent Chinese! Otherwise you will leave this place with half empty stomach and feeling stupid."}
{"text":"This is a fun place for Dim Sum. Great selection, fast paced, lots of carts & servers. If you share a table, chances are you'll get seated quicker. The food was fresh and hot. They have some unusual selections as well as the expected cuisine.  I would go here again in a heartbeat"}
{"text":"Our family loves Yum Cha (dim sum in cantonese)!  We went there for father's day, arrived quite early (10:00am-10:30am) and got a table straight away - we saw there was a big queue on the way out!  We have had much better yum cha in different parts of the world but well, this is the best in Montreal and it's good and the restaurant is just like the usual chinese resto, noisy and busy!!  We will go again when we feel that dim sum craving!!"}
{"text":"I just had lunch with a group of 16 people.
Decided to organize a spontaneous lunch and made a reservation which turned out to be a good decision: this place is packed on Sunday for lunch! 
Long queues when we arrived, yet we breezed through... 

A few of us decided to have dim sum lunch and the rest ordered a dinner for 8 which could easily have fed 11 people for lunch.

A variety of veggies, chicken, fried fish, shrimp were devoured.     Everybody loved it. 

Dim sum was pretty standard, not the best quality I've ever had, yet good enough. 

Service was fast and fine. 

Nothing fancy schmancy, but overall good experience"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've done dim sum. This place is located in chinatown at the top of a mall complex with a nice view if you get seated next to the window. The food is your typical dim sum, nothing too special. The food wasn't spectacular or special, but the people were very pushy, which is common. It took them a long time to bring us water, and even longer to just get us a pitcher as we were finishing our waters pretty quickly on a Sunday morning, after drinking all night Saturday. Very cheap though, you can have a feast for a group of 4 for about $50."}
{"text":"Uggghhh. I have been here a few times, and it is simply not all that great.  The servers continually come around with carts full of greasy, fried Chinese food that may or may not be hot.

The service is terrible and only about one in three dishes is particularly good.  The fried shrimp balls and the egg tarts are among the better options.

However, and this is a big \"however\", if you like the idea of a Chinese buffet that is brought to your table by people who speak no English or French, you may like it.  There are also lots of Chinese people who eat here, so i am open to the possibility of being way off base on this one. Some of the fried items my friends who insist on coming here rave about taste eerily similar to lukewarm Chicken McNuggets to me.

If you have a group of friends and a couple of pre-dinner drinks before coming here, you might love this. It may also be good for those who want to eat in preparation for something like the World Chinese Food Eating Competition (or poor, hungry college students)."}
{"text":"We're used to having dim sum in the Boston area and nothing really compares to China Pearl in Quincy, MA.  This place was no exception.  We decided to try this place when I saw an ad for it in our hotel attractions guide.  They advertised themselves as the best dim sum restaurant in Montreal and man, if it is, that's pretty sad.  The food wasn't terrible.  It's just nowhere near the quality of what we're used to in Boston.  

We ordered the usual, shrimp dumplings, shiu mai, cow stomach, egg tarts, stuffed eggplant, and maybe a few other things.  The stuff was just ok.  

The restaurant was actually pretty small and even at 1pm, there was a fairly long wait.  I felt like the food wasn't coming around often enough despite the number of people.  There was no specialty foods section and some things that we're used to seeing on carts, we didn't see at all.  At the time, they didn't have any shrimp ha-churn or sticky rice, or lo mai gai.  Those are all pretty common but we didn't see them at all.

Can't pass up dim sum on a weekend morning but if there's nothing better in Montreal, I guess I'd come here again"}
{"text":"Running chicken is disappointing they actually microwaved the chicken. (How you know, the chicken skin is curling)

Dirty dishes and cup with lip stick stain 

They even demanded 15% tips . On top of the taxed amount . Should be before tax. If the food and cup were good and clean, I don't mind tip the 15%

The red bean dessert contains tons of corn starch. This means the put too much water to make the dessert."}
{"text":"Coming from Brooklyn Chinatown, I'd have to say the food was a bit disappointing. I also did come with high expectations. I got there with only a few people ahead of me. After getting seated the carts with the good dimsum barely got to me. When it did, although it was fresh, it wasn't as tasty."}
{"text":"Wind your way through the odd commercial labyrinth that hides the wide windows and dumpling cart derby of Kam Fung, walk past the line to get your name on the list, then sit with the families lining the benches and listen closely for your number. 

Hope to get a good seat, at the confluence of cart paths and close to the kitchen door for optimum hotness. If you've come before or read reviews and know some things you want to order don't hesitate to let the staff know, they are friendly and fast and your needs will be met. 

The dumplings, including seafood, all taste fresh and delicious, same with all the veg. The smelt did not agree with us entirely, but then, we were not smelt ready. We may never be."}
{"text":"This is a good place for Dim Sum, just at the edge of the Montreal China Town.  Although the placement inside a mall is not the most scenic or engaging, the food is good and the atmosphere is appropriate for a Dim Sum place.  The dishes tend towards the greasy, but that isn't so unusual for Dim Sim.  

Several people have compared this restaurant to ones elsewhere; I've had Dim Sum in Shanghai a few times, and for me this place compares well.  A more detailed comparison with a specific restaurant versus a city or country is silly since Shanghai, for example, has both good places and awful ones, and it's a subjective issue.  What I really want to find it a good authentic Chinese steamed bun (xiaolongbao) restaurant in Montreal (something like Din Tai Fung)."}
{"text":"A fun way to spend a few hours with people you like to talk to. I have a whole blog review for this wonderful place.

Pros - Inexpensive, fun, try different foods
Cons - Can have a long wait to be seated during certain hours/days

Food - delicious
Service - non-personalized but quick
Price - cheap
Decor - n/a"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been there in the central town of montreal for a longtime. I used to go there very often; however, my last visit was horrible.. As our waiter told me to pay more tips because they eliminated the taxed on your bill( I paid 10.75% tips based on our 60$ bill, I did not know that this 60 dollars is taxes free). 

I then took out more money and gave it to him. But I told him that please do not do the same thing next time since I do not feel comfortable. He then let more waiters explain their rules which are no taxes, more tip rules. I told him that I disagreed this rule and no one will get ride of taxes, and I would rather pay taxes this time but no tips for today's service. What I get after is a swear from his mouth.... I could not believe it and I felt horrible.. I did not fight back since I try not to take it personal. BUT,
 After we left from the restaurant, another waiter came out and confirm with me if I am really going to leave this place without tipping that waiter who just swore to me. 

That 's why I decided to see the owner of the restaurant. What I get is the same rule- no taxes charged so more tips. I told him that I would like to get my cash back and then pay by debit card so I will pay taxes but no TIP at all. 

This kind of service and experience was horrible."}
{"text":"Literally the worst dim sum I've ever had.  This being my first review and I don't believe in wasting my time with writing reviews but it's so bad that I'm actually taking my time out of the day to write you a warning not to ever set foot in this establishment.  The waiter was extremely pushy trying to get us to order dishes that we don't want to eat.  It took 30 minutes for 4 dishes we order to come so we ended up sitting around with cold tea for the whole time.  There was no condiments on the table, I had to ask several times then got up, walked into the kitchen and got them myself.  I'm writing this review as an Asian diner that has been to all kind of Asian restaurant my whole life with all kind of bad service but this is by far the worst.  Mind you I haven't even touch the topic of the food which was a steaming pile of hot garbage. Please do us all a favor and close down."}
{"text":"I got some steamed buns to take away for a meeting there. The choice was not overwhelming but they came hot and fresh (I did have to wait quite a while though). The bread was nice and fluffy but the BBQ filling was nothing to write home about. They come by 3 at 4.50 an order, neither very cheap nor expensive for dim sum I find. 
The restaurant in itself was big and the hostess was helpful and smiling. I might go back for a full meal but it isn't very high in my priorities."}
{"text":"The journey of 1000 miles starts with the first step.  That first step should be toward Toronto, if one is at all looking for reasonable dim sum.  The confusion around the usual carts v. paper ordering has been alluded to in other reviews, as has the service and tipping aspects.  But the food just isn't that good, even compared to other areas as diverse as Windsor to San Diego, despite being in a more metropolitan place like Montreal.  The concierge at our hotel did warn us that when she recommended this place, that the best chinese food is actually a train ride away...to Toronto."}
{"text":"Taking the recommendations of a friend of a friend, I headed to Maison Kam Fung to get some takeaway.  The restaurant is on the 2nd floor - and the only way I found it was because of the neon sign in the window. You go through what seems like the entrance to an apartment block but it's actually a mini mall. Upstairs is a huge room full of round tables and most of the customers are of chinese descent.  The staff seem friendly and are bustling.

It took longer than they said it would take but I was in no rush. The food was fantastic. I went for the steamed shrimp dumplings, tofu and vegetables and steamed rice. Way too much food!  The dumplings were by far my favorite and I wished I had just got a few sets of dumplings. The tofu and veggies were generous with huge chunks of lightly fried tofu, big chunks of broccoli and mushrooms. It's like they read my mind. My favorite veg. I'd definitely go there again and would recommend to go for the dim sum."}
{"text":"Excellent Authentic Chinese food.    I took some friends and we all shared the following:   EIght treasures Clay Pot, Fish with baby Bok Choy, Steak with Peppered marinate and Ginger and Scallion Steamed chicken.  

All items were prepared very well.   The service was prompt and attentive.   This could be a problem sometimes when the lounge is fully occupied, but our waiter was very good.     They also serve Americanized Chinese, but the Dim Sum and the Authentic Chinese dishes are WNNERS.."}
{"text":"Our hotel is a few blocks from Montreal's Chinatown so of course we planned on having dim sum (which in my opinion is much better in Canada than it is in NYC).  Yelp had this rated highly and I can see why.  Located on the second floor of a strip mall, this place isn't all fancy looking but it's the food that counts, right?

Shumai and shrimp dumplings were fresh and steaming and chock full of meat and shrimp.  Fried taro cake was also excellent and pan fried to perfection.  Shrimp noodles were delicate and the XO sauce cheong fun was sautéed perfectly.  This restaurant even has individual sized Chinese sausage rice or pork rib rice originally cooked in a clay pot.  The best thing however was the warm egg custard tarts which got rave reviews from the kiddies.  Excellent dim sum and extremely reasonable (4 of us got stuffed on 55 bucks Canadian, can't beat that)."}
{"text":"I was in Montreal and for some reason, craving spicy dumplings so we found this place. It definitely satisfied my spicy dumpling craving and more. It's a traditional dim sum place. It's a large restaurant on the second floor of this building filled with random shops and restaurants. You can see the name of the restaurant from outside the building if you just look up. They have tables of all sizes and on a random weekday, they were coming around with carts. They had all the standard shrimp dumplings that I love and they definitely seemed fresh and delicious. The prices are reasonable. The tea was quite good. The place was fast and efficient. The service was what I would expect at a dim sum place, a bit rough around the edges but there to serve effectively. Definitely en par with some of the dim sum places I've been to in Manhattan though I have also been to better."}
{"text":"Coming from New York where Dim Sum runs amok in city, it's hard to go somewhere that can match it. Unfortunately, Maison Kam Fung fell short like many other places outside of New York and San Francisco. First a quick observation was that this was actually the first Chinese restaurant I've been to where they actually have seating for 2 at a Dim Sum restaurant, which was interesting. The restaurant is located on the 2nd floor and pretty much occupies the corner of the building. It's pretty spacious still, but was crowded on a Friday morning when I went.

Much of the Dim Sum that we ordered was just not up to the standards I was used to in NY, but it might be a matter of preference because the stuffing in the items were not what I expected. Many of their dishes were stuffed with pork, which is not what I'm used to. The spring rolls are actually just smaller egg rolls. They did serve the usual dishes you will see, such as Ha Gao, but still the selection seemed to be lacking some items. On the bright side though, their egg custards were very good with the crispy flaky crust and they offered the coconut squares which I love!

Although the food was disappointing, it was not surprising, since Montreal is not known for their Dim Sum or Chinatown. If you're looking for quality Dim Sum in Canada, Toronto is probably where you'll find it, not Montreal."}
{"text":"it was good but we were hoping it be amazing. the hong kong soy sauce noodles was the best we've had in a dim sum restaurant. the silky rice noodle on the shrimp noodle were very good. the pork sho mei which is my utmost fav had a little too much pork (can't believe I'm saying that) it need a little more shrimp. the har gow was ok but I liked the fried shrimp dumpling better. what saved some of the dim sum was their dark smokey soy sauce. 

like i said it was good but we've had way better."}
{"text":"My wife and I had tried this dim sum restaurant a few years ago and she wasn't impressed then (she's half chinese). We decided to try again and still didn't care for it. Bland, pasty dim sum, hot shrimp that was old and not warm at all. Had to beg to get a glass of water. Worst of all, we thought they added a service charge so we we didn't leave an extra tip so they hounded us as we left, loudly asking why no tip, etc. We gave them an extra $5 to shut them up but the hounding for a tip was both humiliating and stupid. Give this place a pass. It's just plain weird!"}
{"text":"Fairly good dimsum. Nothing amazing but they met expectations. I do like that they have a wide variety of things, some of which I have never heard of."}
{"text":"This place has excellent all round Chinese food. Standard fare + dumplings. We came here and ordered one of the set meal's for two and loved everything. It's also reasonably priced. Might come back to try the dumplings which we were way too full for.

Excellent Chinese in Chinatown. I'd been looking for a standard fare place like this for a quite a while."}
{"text":"Very poor quality of dim sum. It is cold, sometimes over cooked and have to wait too long to get served"}
{"text":"Dim sum! Dim sum! Dim sum!
Si vous n'avez jamais essayé cette formule traditionnelle du dimanche, c'est un excellent endroit pour le faire.  C'est typique: bruyant, surpeuplé, bon, et pas cher!  Préparez-vous toutefois à attendre si vous arrivez après midi (vous attendrez quand même avant, mais moins longtemps...).  Tous les mets étaient savoureux, le service rapide au point d'en être envahissant (les charriots s'arrêtent à votre table tellement souvent qu'il devient difficile de suivre le cours d'une conversation), le choix intéressant et varié au point que nous n'avons pas pu tout goûter (mes deux coups de coeur: les dumplings aux pétoncles et crevettes et les calmars frits).  Tous les fruits de mer étaient parfaitement cuits (c'est à dire pas trop) et frais.  Nous sommes tous sortis le ventre bombé et ayant besoin d'une bonne marche digestive...  La facture: 120$ (incluant taxes et pourboire) pour 4 adultes et 3 enfants.  Pas cher, j'ai dit..."}
{"text":"Oh man, this place has some great dim sum!! Everything always tastes fresh and right out of the steamer (I personally like steamed items more that fried ones). Service is efficient and there are always tons of carts going around. Sometimes I felt it hard to catch the attention of a waiter to maybe get a glass of water - but overall a definite GO!!"}
{"text":"Every single dish is super salty. Just a very below average dim sum place. The standards just aren't there. Food isn't too greasy though, so there's that. A lot of the dishes weren't even decent. Only good \"dish\" was the egg tarts (super silky filling and super buttery crust), although that's probably sourced from elsewhere, not made in-house. Would not recommend this dim sum place."}
{"text":"Une très bonne surprise !

L'endroit ne paye vraiment pas de mine, mais ça vaut le coup de s'y aventurer.

Le concept est simple : les serveurs passent vous voir avec des chariots et vous proposent différents plats. Si ça vous tente, vous le prenez et si ce n'est pas le cas, vous passez votre tour et attendez le chariot suivant. Attention, ce service se fait uniquement le MIDI. Le soir, c'est un \"vrai\" restaurant.

Ca peut être un peu stressant au début en mode \"Euh quelle est cette chose ? Je la prends ou pas ?\" mais il ne faut pas se laisser intimider. Personnellement, j'ai choisi mes plats \"au feeling\" et je n'ai pas été déçue ! Les dim sum sont succulents, surtout ceux aux crevettes. 

Niveau prix, c'est environ 5$ l'assiette de dim sum (qui sont généralement servis par 2 ou par 4 en fonction de leur nature). Je recommande donc d'en prendre plusieurs, et de partager !

Bon, effectivement la déco n'est vraiment pas top, mais ça c'est un détail."}
{"text":"My ILs took us here for dim sum.  Living in the City, you're spoiled with eating good chinese food and dim sum.  Kam Fung is ok.  They offer cart service but it's a real sloow cart service.  We were literally doing \"yum cha\" between cart service because service was slow and they kept recycling the same old same old. 

Restaurant is clean but there were a lot of people.  It's located inside a mall.  

It's ok but I prefer the Chinese food in Vancouver."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I stumbled upon Kam Fung as we were looking for a restaurant in the Chinese Quartier (there are lots of options) and we decided to give it a try, picking it at random. We did not expect the friendly service we received nor the huge amounts of delicious food the waiter brought us. When my plate arrived, tofu in spicy sauce (which isn't really spicy by the way), it took me at least 5 seconds of staring at my plate to grasp that this monstruous portion was one meal... Although we ordered for two it could have easily fed 3 people. At the end of our meal we were both very satisfied and extremely full. We're very happy we found a nice restaurant with lots of options and good food, and we'll certainly be going back in the future!"}
{"text":"One of the worst dim sum place I have been to. The food was mediocre, it wasn't really bad; it's the service that really shocked me. The waiters and host are incredibly rude. They did not take debt/credit due to machine malfunction, but they did not inform us this as we went inside. After we got the bill, the waiter over charged us by 5 dollars because I insisted I don't wanna pay cash and I must pay by card. It is only after my friend said she would pay for me by cash that they corrected the proper bill amount. 

Overall terrible dining experience, food is at most average( or below avg), would not recommend."}
{"text":"Came this to place for dim sum with the family. I'd recommend coming earlier in the day because it gets packed really quickly. 

You'll find all the amenities that is included in dim sum here! Great har gao (shrimp ball), shu mai (pork dumpling), etc etc. Everything is fresh and hot. My favorites are definitely the cha leung, sorry if I'm spelling it wrong, but it's the Chinese bread stick wrapped around rice noodle. The chicken feet are pretty good. Also the lo mai kai (sticky rice) is really yummy. 

Service here is pretty good, the earlier you come the better the service since it'll be less busy! But also they are pretty good at getting you in a timely manner. 

It's probably one of the best dim sum places in Montreal that I've been to recently. I would definitely recommend coming here with your family and friends."}
{"text":"Since Dim Sum is so rubbish in downtown Washington DC, decided to go and have dim sum in Chinatown in Montreal.  My recollection is that it is much better quality.  Search on the internet, most website recommend this one and Restaurant Ruby Rouge.  There was a long queue when I got there, but it was moving pretty fast.  The hostess started shouting if anyone would mind sharing a table, so there is no need to wait that long I thought go for it.  However, it turns out that they led me to a small two persons table.  Dim sum are served in trolley here.  Just pick what you like from the trolley.  The portion size are much bigger than in Europe or Asia.  The Panfried Chives and Pork Dumpling is tasty, but not exceptional and comes in extra jumbo size, slightly too salty, the Steamed Pork Dumpling (Siu Mei) is not bad, and the Deep Fried Seafood Roll with Mayo is great.  I would say it is no comparison to Dim Sum in London or Hong Kong, but not bad, it deserves a three stars.  The atmosphere is lively.  The service is ok, but it is not expensive, more than New York, but the portion is large."}
{"text":"beware!!!! dead fish in tank while eating here and got severe food poisoning that day! do not eat here"}
{"text":"This place has carts. That is the end of the positive aspects of this review.

Ok...So, maybe I came at the wrong time, it was Monday, and it was 1:45pm...so maybe that is what happened, but I gotta tell you, this is perhaps the worst dim sum I've ever had. Ouch, right? it's true! I am normally the fat kid in a candy shop when I'm at a dim sum joint, even if it isn't great, I'll eat every little bit. I left nearly two and a half full (of the 5 I ordered) plates on the table.

Here are some specifics for those of you that want to know...

1) The Shrimp Rice noodle...was OK...the shrimps were at least shrimpy and large, and the sauce was passable.
2) The Fried shrimp dumplings. ICK! These are some of my faves, because they are so easy to do, and so hard to screw up...Kam Fung...you screwed them up. It tasted as if someone had deep fried them, let them sit out for a couple hours, microwaved and then soaked them in Oil. They were the greasiest, unappetizing, foul little things ever...yick!
3) The pan fried shrimp and chive patty things...god...if I thought nothing could be worse than the fried shrimp dumplings...i was severely mistaken. These were literally falling apart...in a bad way...they had no flavor other than disgusting.
4) The Xiu Mai (pork dumpling) was tough, hot at least, but you ate it in full chunks, cause you had no choice
5) The char sui bao (bbq pork dumpling) was alright...but pretty flavorless and the pastry was yicky...

Here's the worst of it...The soy sauce...was AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In a Kikoman bottle and was either 19 months past its due date, or was some knock off that was baked in the sun with sonny's secret sauce (lard). The soy sauce was greasy and coated everything with this OIL (think car oil) like quality. Seriously though...it was like the Exxon-Valdez all over again!  Thank god there were no penguins!


By the way, the bathroom is around corner. It is not the one that requites a key however, if you are at that bathroom, go towards the restaurant and turn left at the next door. 

Please...eat anywhere but here...like McDonalds, or Fishy Joes..."}

{"text":"Arrived around 10am on a summer Thursday and saw tables of various age combinations. Since it was early, we were advised to order from the checklist (which came with a picture guide) rather than to wait for the pushcarts. The dimsum was good and I thought the prices were fair but I am used to Manhattan prices. Was it better than what I've had in Hong Kong, NYC, or San Francisco - no, I think that they are all about the same frankly. If you want elevated dimsum, you end up paying $12+ per dish at fine dine places like Red Farm or Annisa in NYC."}
{"text":"Je crois que je n'y peux rien, je vais devoir faire les pours et contres en me comparant au Rubies Rouge. La Maison Kam Fung est plus petite mais le le roulement des chariots est plus rapide. Le service est presque toujours au moins de «relativement occupé» à très occupé. La qualité, je trouve, est très semblable à celle de Rubie Rouge. Maintenant je crois qu'où La Maison Kam Fung l'emporte en revanche est clairement sur la netteté des nappes et du décor qui est un peu moins passé date que l'autre et sur le choix. Il y a un choix plus important en Dim sums à la Maison Kam Fung. Je n'ai pas eut une digestion superbe pour ce lunch mais en revanche pour Rubie Rouge, je n'ai jamais jamais eut un problème à ce niveau. Les toilettes au Rubie Rouge sont plus propres qu'au Kam Fung (et beaucoup plus grande aussi) et cela me porte à croire que la cuisine l'est surement aussi au moins un peu plus. En comparant les deux j'arrive à un Ex-Equo basé sur la propreté, les heures d'ouvertures (plus flexible du Rubies rouge) et sa grandeur absolue VS le choix supérieur et le roulement rapide du Kam Fung. Exemple le toffu chaud avec sirop de gingembre est dispo tous les jours au Kam Fung et seulement les Week-ends au Rubie rouge. 

Chacun son baptême et à mon avis, c'est vraiment le premier où vous aller, des deux ,qui va faire une grosse différence sur votre opinion sur le sujet. 

English: 

I cannot do aything else but compare Kam Fung to Ruby Rouge (on 1003 Clark). Both have stronger points that are completly different to other. I'll compare both with simple things we look at in Dim Sums

Choice. Kam Fung wins with a larger amount of Choice.

Cleaniness: I personnaly feel that on the Decor side, Kam Fung win, but bathroom which is usually an example of how clean the kitchen is, is way bigger and cleaner at Ruby Rouge. I personnally didn't feel that well after my lunch at Kam Fung which never happened at Ruby Rouge.

Opening Hours: I feel there is a clear win from Ruby rouge there. I've been at lot of akward hours and it was always opened. Kam Fung has a more traditionnal opening hours for Dim sums (12 to 3PM and 5PM to 8Pm) . 

Quality: There's a lot of disagreement there, I'm sure, but I personnaly felt it was too similar to have a very strong opinion on the subject. 

Overall, there's pros and cons for both that brings me to the conclusion that it's pretty similar. I'll go there some other time to see if 1) I feel better after or still felt a bit sick. 2) If the quality is different on week-ends."}
{"text":"been here multiple times, decent date atmosphere for a very homey comfortable morning feel
when it gets packed you'd better gtfo cause it's full of screaming mandarin and clinking noises 
food is pretty good and not too expensive, it's a good dim sum place
the waitresses who bring the food around could do with being a little less abrasive but I understand since 
it's how they need to act to get our attention 
would help ifyou knew how to speak the language, otherwise you might be confused
went with a white friend once and they brought him a bigger plate with a fork and knife while the rest of us used chopsticks LOL
kinda racist but jokes 
would recomment"}

{"text":"The wait was quick but the service is horrible... Food took  almost 30'mins to come around. Location was hard to find due to the fact the place itself is called KUM FUNG and yelp is listed under kim fung.."}
{"text":"Service was prompt as u would expect in a place like this.  Food was excellent and the price was spot on!  Only gripe was the servers rarely stopped by the table to hard to get water or more hot sauce.  I'll def be back!"}
{"text":"Nous avons envie un Dim Sum ce jour là. Nous avons trouvé ce restaurant au hasard, l'extérieur ne paie pas de mine. L'horaire d'ouverture nous convient , à 7h du matin. Nous sommes allés à un lundi matin, peu de monde et service très rapide. Les serveuses parlent cantonais et mandarin, très peu anglais et français. 
Vous pouvez vous aider des photos pour commander car la fiche à cocher est en chinois. Les Dim sum sont délicieux , bon rapport qualité prix."}
{"text":"The food was above average, but not mind-blowing.  The price was right though and the service was quick given the throngs of hungry patrons in the dining hall.  Given the significantly sized Chinatown in Montreal I have to say, I was hoping for something a little bit more exciting, but this was by no means bad."}
{"text":"I went there for having dim sum with my friend. The taste is quite authentic. The service is also good. After around 10am, when there was more and more clients, some waiters pushed handcarts containing different dishes around tables. They stayed for a moment to explain to sitting clients what dishes they had in the handcart. If clients want something they had, they will give it directly to them. I really like this way because I think it shows a bite what tradition dim sum looks like in Guangdong province."}
{"text":"Unbelievably deliciously satisfying!!! The best dim sum in Montreal's Chinatown. The shrimp dishes are my favorite items from any dim sum and this place absolutely rocks with its hai cao, shu mai and shrimp crab claw.

I would be a regular if I lived here!
*** BEWARE: there is a discrepancy with the name of this restaurant - Kam Fung or Kim Fung it's the same place!"}
{"text":"Canadian dim sum.

I'm Chinese. I have a pretty high standard. My momma makes dim sum. I've even had dim sum from Hong Kong. So, this dim sum didn't really rock my world. BUT, it's pretty dang authentic dim sum. I'm sure this is a spot lots of Chinese in Quebec come to. I came here after running a race and boy, did it hit the spot. Grease, carbs, and chicken feet. That's all you need.

Tips: The staff are fluent in Mandarin, Cantonese, English, and French. That's so crazy to me."}
{"text":"Dim sum delivered on carts, my favorite way to eat. We came on a Sunday at 11:00 and were seated immediately. We then proceeded to stuff ourselves, choosing from among the wonderful delicacies that were wheeled past our table by an army of Asian women. Full to the gills, we only spent about $20 Canadian per person. A great experience, and the food, while maybe not up to San Francisco or New York standards, was very good."}
{"text":"When I used to take trips up to Montreal to visit relatives, we split our time between my uncles' houses and Chinatown. So on my first trip to Montreal as an adult (with my best friend), I thought, \"I need to go see the city outside of Chinatown.\" However, it was rainy when we first arrived so we wandered into a mall close to our hotel. Lo and behold, it was a mall of Chinese shops and we were on the edge of Chinatown. We suddenly happened upon this dim sum place and one should not walk away when food beckons to them.

We ordered all our usual dishes: shumai, various steamed dumplings, spare ribs, etc. Everything was flavorful and cooked to perfection without excessive oil, grease, and salt. My favorite dish, believe it or not, was the egg tart. It was THE most perfect egg tart I had ever tasted; the crust was flaky with a hint of salty and sweet, and the custard was the perfect amount of sweet and yellow. Both of us got so hooked on the egg tarts, we actually went back the following day. Sadly, we got there too late and they were all sold out! Apparently, they sell out by the mid-afternoon."}
{"text":"It's not that great but not bad, as I hadn't expected too much, Surely that can't be compared with what we ate in China, but our favorite courses like Har Gow, chicken feet, black bean spare ribs, Siu Mai, beef ball, rice noodle rolls...met our expectation anyway. We came a bit late at about 12:40. Fortunately we took our time, some new dishes came late. I love Cantonese morning tea, there are always tons of choices, as it's not too much every plate, so you can take a lot of different ones at one time. Besides, as you pick from the pushcarts directly, it's easy to choose than from menus."}
{"text":"This place has great dim sum! The wait, although a bit annoying, is worth it. The custard buns are awesome, as is most of the food. The only other drawback, however, is that some of the waiters had a bit of difficulty understanding us, but generally the cart ladies would be able to steer you in the right direction."}
{"text":"As in a lot of all you can eat style places, some foods are wins and some are misses. I loved the fried taro with pork, egg tarts, spring rolls and shrimp dimsums. But i would not recommend the chow mein, daikon cake and fried squid. The chow mein, daikon cake was dry and fried squid was not crispy and lacked proper seasoning.

Still though, the service was super quick albeit the majority of the waiters only knew very little english but most of the food was still pretty good! The bill was a bit on the pricey side ($30 incl tip) but we were satisfied with how full we were afterwards!

Would come here again :)"}
{"text":"We often go for dim sum here on weekend mornings - interesting tasty food in a fun atmosphere for very little money - can it get better than that? 

Kam Fung tends to be quite packed and sometimes you have to wait in line a little while. Since there is usually lots to see in the mixed crowd, I have never found this wait boring.

The food is generally good, though a bit heavy on the pork & shrimp side. With dim sum you never really know what you get, and the choice of dishes varies with the time of day and the location of your table. One day all your favourites might arrive speedily on a few carts and within minutes, the other day you get to choose between two types of noodles and three types of tripe - yummy! But in general all the classics are readily available. They do a good broccoli, whole fried shrimp and coconut pudding. More special tastes like chicken feet are available only upon request."}
{"text":"I loved this place, I am not one of the many Yelpers from Toronto who are apparently spoiled so if your do not fall in that category you may love this as much as I do. Fantastic pork buns and lots of enjoyable side dishes. We had some kind of coconut pastry that was fantastic. It was a little much as it is extremely loud and busy as you have people just rolling around it carts to serve food.

My husband has never been to any type of Chinatown or anything of that nature so he was pretty surprised by what this place was like it was a little overwhelming for him so maybe a good thing to keep in mind. Would come back here in a heartbeat makes a fun Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Little carts buzzing by bringing you all sorts of delicious treats.  Shrimp dumplings, char Sui dumplings, flat noodles, etc.  Love it."}
{"text":"One of your traditional dim sum places that still utilize carts. It was also quite difficult to find this plwce- asked a few locals for help. This place was okay- definitely had better dim sum before, but the service was good here. I didn't try too many dishes, but one I would avoid is the shu mai here. It didn't stand out to me- much better choices available at this place. Pork ribs, beancurd wrapped, and egg tarts were pretty good here. We also ordered a pork crispy pan fried noodles, and it was a bit of a let down. It didn't have the \"wok\" smell to it, and it was kinda strange they added peppers to the dish. Also, they didn't serve it with vinegar on the side like they do at other places. Good portion size though. Overall, food was a bit pricey here, but not bad when craving dim sum."}
{"text":"Read about this in Fodor's.  Inside a mall.

Had dim sum.  Pretty good, but dim sum in Chicago's Chinatown is better.

Friendly service; spoke English.  Dim sum ends at 3pm (technically), but they start taking the carts back at about 2:40.  So be prepared.  You can still place an order for dim sum with the waiter, but you would need to know what you want."}
{"text":"My hunch is that one's love for Kim Fung depends on where you come from. Because this is solid, if not stand out dim sum. However, it comes on carts! 

For those of us in smaller towns where dim sum carts are nonexistent, the cart experience is a treat. And I would absolutely recommend this place for anyone coming from a cart deprived part of the world.

If you are visiting Montreal from New York, San Francisco, or Los Angeles, this spot is totally skippable. 

The silky hot tofu pudding with sweet ginger sauce was the big winner of the day. It's one of my long time favorites, and Kim Fung rocked it. Plus my daughter had never tried this dish before, and now she is a fan. 

My son can eat two plates of the rice noodle wrapped donut. And he did.

Had it not been for the oddly stiff meatballs and getting a seat in the back room away from the action and the beauty of the main parlor, this would have been an even better experience. However, the overall rating would not change.

Regardless, when we return to Montreal, this dim sum parlor will again be a destination. However, next time, I'm going to stop in early for just a few plates and a pot of tea. 

Hopefully I'll be able to convince my family to enjoy a progressive meal throughout Chinatown, as we nosh on soup dumplings, hand pulled noodles, and sweets from some of the other nearby shops."}
{"text":"Excellent dim sum spot. When we want to do stuff downtown this has become the go to for good food. Would recommend coming as a group so that you can try a wider variety of snacks."}
