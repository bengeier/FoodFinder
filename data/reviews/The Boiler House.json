{"text":"Gorgeous bar area that has stools the perfect size for my bum  and all the oyster varieties I love.  The entire space is an old building used in the distillery process so when we visited on one of the hottest days of the year it felt the sort of natural cool that you just crave instead of just being highly air-conditioned.  I had their rum cask ale, which was flavorful and rich with couple of dozen malpeque oysters.  Great combo when combined with good friends on a hot afternoon.    Only problem was that we did wait 15 minutes at a bar with 5 people sitting at it and 3 bartenders to just get a menu.  It wasn't even busy with dinner service yet.  After we waited another 5 minutes for our beer to come from the fridge in front of us to be served.  It was quite strange and confusing.  We stayed paitent though and the food was quite good but overall they really could get better on their service."}
{"text":"The Boiler House is situated in the Distillery District in Toronto downtown. It appears that they have converted an abandoned distillery to a restaurant and the result is fantastic. They have a very good patio with sofas which gives the impression of an open-air lounge. The bar is situated in a corner on the patio as well so you can enjoy some drinks before proceeding inside to eat (you can eat outside too but the tables are small outside so if you're with a bigger group than probably it'd be better to move inside).  Inside there are two seating areas, ground floor and upstairs. We had a jazz band playing live music upstairs, also there was a birthday bash (I guess) going on on a table near us so it was fairly loud but not in a disturbing way. The decor inside is very good as well where they have transformed a wall into a wine cabinet while keeping the retro distillery look intact.   I didn't order anything fancy. Risotto with a steak and cheesecake as dessert. The steak was very tender and very tasty and was served with vapor-boiled/sauteed vegetables on the side. The risotto and the cheesecake were good (you can't go wrong with a cheesecake or could you? hehe) as well. They have got a huge wine collection, I selected a Pinot Noir to go with my steak (once again as I said I wasn't trying to go with anything fancy).  The service is quick and efficient. The thing which amused me is that they have a dedicated server who asks every person on the table (once they've been served) \"Black Pepper\"? And once they answer yes, he proceeds to sprinkle ground black pepper on their dish. I found it funny (I mean the restaurant has a respectable, chic look going on already without this sort of gimmickry but whatever makes them happy. Perhaps some fresh culinary school graduate is applying whatever they learned in the school).  This restaurant is on the expensive side. Expect to pay around $70 (taxes and tips included) per person if you go the full drinks-before-dinner, entree, main course, dessert, wine, coffee way but then I wouldn't expect anything else from a fancy restaurant in downtown Toronto. A good experience all in all."}
{"text":"Went here a couple months ago for my uncle's birthday brunch.  We had really hoped this place would work out... he's quite the choosy type when it comes to food, to say the least.  Turns out, the Boiler House met his requirements.  It's located in the Distillery, one of my favorite areas in Toronto. There's lots of great entertainment here along with many cool restaurants and stores.     The brunch at the Boiler House is above the standard fare. I also found that many of the dishes resemble or are influenced by French cuisine, which I liked.  There are many foods to choose from: there's an omelette bar, a carving station, cured meats, beef brisket, smoked salmon, many kinds of sausage,  (more meat, anyone?) belgian waffles, roast potatoes, quiche, perogies, fresh fruits, and small desserts with assorted pastries (Whew... what a mouthful... literally!) You can imagine the buffet table is pretty big; try not to overload on the first trip!  I don't know if you'll be paying attention to the atmosphere while you devour your brunch, but there's a great jazz band that plays and the decor is pretty impressive.  The Boiler House is a great way to spend birthdays, special occasions, or Easter brunch. Also a cool Toronto landmark."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place without writing yet another Harlequin-esque review?  There's a rustic elegance to this place that almost makes you feel like you don't belong; a very pretentious air about it when you first walk in. Ohhh, how is this possibly a positive review? Well, the staff puts you at ease immediately - very friendly, even funny at times, and always attentive - yes, even for a self-serve buffet.   Which leads me to the food... delicious! The thing about buffet tables is the gluttonous food saturation. Your plate is already full by the time you reach the halfway mark of the buffet table with a succulent roast beef waiting for you at the end, and a lovely fruit/cheese platter and omelette station going to the right of you.  Don't rush, you're paying your $25 and are entitled to enjoy the atmosphere and your company and savour the food they're providing. There's a lot of it so you'll want to pace yourself.  Also, an indication for me of any brunch place is how they cook their home fries, roast potatoes, hashbrowns, whatever word we want to give it. Boom goes the dynamite! Amazing!"}
{"text":"The Boiler House is an incredibly high quality restaurant. The restaurant has a variety of different and equally beautiful views. All of the interior decorations were taken from the distillery itself, which adds to the uniqueness of this restaurant. The classical guitarist adds a nice touch as well. The food is always excellent, particularly the specials. The staff is also very knowledgable and clearly enjoy their jobs. Compliments to Chef Eric Pless who always creates unique and incredible menus!"}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's party.  While the place has nice ambiance, our waiter was attitude central and made it seem like he definitely did not want to be serving a party of 20.  He would avoid eye contact with us when we were trying to get his attention to order drinks.  We would order, and it would take about 20 minutes to receive our pints.  This would be understandable if it was jumping, but there was hardly anyone in the restaurant or outside.  My roommate's latte arrived cold and he acted like he was doing her the biggest favor when she sent it back.  She got another one quickly, this one scalding hot.  Nice one.  Another friend and I decided to order food, which arrived about 45 minutes after we ordered it.  My poutine was cold, the gravy congealed, and there was maybe one cheese curd in it.  My friend's chicken wings tasted like fish and chips.    When we got the bill, he didn't bother to include gratuity in a party of twenty.  He also tried charging two of my friends extra drinks they didn't order, and tried to charge me for the beer I ordered, but he messed up (brought me the wrong one).    I'd perhaps give this place another go it I was down in the area, as it could very well be that it was just this waiter's attitude that ruined it for me, but I will definitely not be making any special trips to The Boiler House any time soon."}
{"text":"First time I have been there. I really liked the decor and vibe.  The overall experience though was just okay.  We went for winterlicious.  I ordered the leek soup to start, and it was pretty great.  I got the Sirloin for dinner- nothing special.  Dessert was a dried up brownie that was terrible.  Service was mediocre.  I also though the jazz band playing was mediocre as well.  Would I go back? Maybe for drinks to sit on the patio, but I wouldn't recommend it to friends"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and atmosphere. Service is excellent. Try eating outdoor. Worth the price which will be about $60/person. Ask for the server Patrick as he has worked there for 2 years and is a true professional. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"After 3 years living in this hood and a couple of trips here for drinks, I finally did a summer dinner on the patio.  This place has wonderful ambiance - inside (restored wood, elevated ceilings) and out (gorgeous patio with flowers, white tablecloths, cobblestone) - and a good wine list. Great first impressions - felt like I was on vacation. This elevates my review by one star.  Had the Lobster Gnocci ($18) and Capon Breast ($26), with a glass of Petite Syrah ($12).   My friend and me had a great evening, but at the price point, the quality of the food and service could be elevated.   I found the flavours in both the capon and lobster gnocchi to be bland - a bit disappointing for the nice presentation. Capon was served with roasted fall-type veggies (in the summer) and just. I just wasn't impressed. The service was friendly but slow.  The wine was excellent and flavorful, and well priced for a good California red.   I hear the brunch is fantastic here - that may be where the value is. Otherwise, it could be a lovely night out, but just be wary of the price point - a tad high for what you get."}
{"text":"It seems somewhat shameful to have less than an essay to write about an experience this good.  In fairness, I had really good company for brunch at the Boiler House this morning, which no doubt contributed to my overall impression (I was dining with six charming and delightful women, five of whom I had the pleasure of meeting for the first time).  Location: This was also my first visit to the Distillery District, and I hereby commit to further exploration and a more fulsome review subsequent.  For now, suffice it to say that the Boiler House is in a really cool location, albeit a *minor* nuisance to access by transit (it's only a five-to-ten minute walk from the King streetcar, so quit griping already!)  Irrelevant rant: I arrived alone at the Boiler House and noticed that the expansive cobblestone patio was unpopulated but partially set up.  Strung between weathered, once-industrial wood beam frames, off-white patio curtains fluttered gently in the chilly October breeze.  Tall grasses in enormous planters guarded the entrance doors and danced to music only they could hear.  Combined with the absence of any locally generated noise, but with the drone of the city providing an eerie acoustic backdrop, the panorama left me feeling as if I had stumbled across a tiny post-industrial ghost town just outside of Toronto's core.  It was quite surreal, and I spent a good five minutes wandering the patio and taking it in.  Restaurant: Inside, the Boiler House was no ghost town.  It's a fully modernized restaurant inside a very old industrial building with exposed brick and wood everywhere.  Seating is available on ground and loft levels and is very group-friendly (they accommodated a wedding reception while we were there).  The brunch buffet is downstairs, with bathrooms on the upper (and I suspect lower) level.  We were seated upstairs near the jazz band; they were fantastic but in retrospect we should have located in a more conversation-friendly spot.  Also, deduct half a point for small washrooms and one broken toilet.  Food: By my estimation, the brunch buffet would be over 150 feet long if it were one straight line.  It's a little like going to Canada's Wonderland in that you can't really cover everything in one trip.  I missed out on the roast beef because I was too full - it's a good idea to survey the lay of the land before you start loading your plate, and fill your first plate (or two) exclusively with \"must have\" items.  Here's what I had (I'm sure I've forgotten something, and yes, I'm bragging a bit):  Croissant Homefries Scrambled Eggs Bacon Breakfast Sausage (thicker than most, and delicious) Bean Salad Tomato Salad Assorted Cheeses Eggs Benedict (mediocre - the muffin was hard and the sauce sparse) Peameal Bacon (I suspect it's either cured in-house or locally.  Had a taste and texture quite different from store-bought stuff, and was fantastic) Smoked Salmon and Capers Cold Cuts including Calabrese Salami (the wide, flat spicy one) Mini Cherry Tart Pecan Pie Portuguese Custard Tart (gave me multiple foodgasms)  Basically, the food was great.  Even with a list that long, I missed out on roast beef, all sorts of fruits, a continental breakfast section and more than enough desserts.  Service: It's true what other reviewers say - the staff here are fantastic.  Best I've dealt with in a long time, and I never went without coffee, a huge deal for me on a Sunday morning.  Overall, this place is great.  It ain't cheap, but in my mind it's worth it."}
{"text":"Oh dear.  I'd love to go back to Boiler House to give it a second chance, since it has generally received good reviews, and the atmosphere is truly lovely.  That being said, however, my first visit -- for a work dinner with about 8 people -- was fairly disastrous.  It started off well -- we ordered a few bottles of wine and the servers seemed very attentive about keeping our glasses topped off.   We were served an amuse-bouche as well.  The restaurant didn't seem particularly crowded that night, but as the minutes dragged on and we waited and waited and waited for our food, it became a fairly excruciating experience.  When our food finally arrived, more than half of the dishes were actually cold.  I had made the mistake of ordering the butternut squash gnocchi, which was essentially a gelatinous orange stick plopped on top of a pile of tired-looking leeks.  Needless to say, I was not impressed.  The staff was apologetic and comped us a bottle of wine, but it didn't entirely take the bad taste out of my mouth.  However, my hard-to-please colleague ordered the rib eye, and he was thrilled with it.  I'm willing to give Boiler House the benefit of the doubt, but since I'm only in Toronto a couple of times a year, the likelihood that I'll return is slim to none."}
{"text":"Visited the Boiler House on a Sunday morning for their brunch buffet.  The experience was very nice!  Wait staff were extremely attentive - I don't remember ever feeling thirsty because my water glass was always filled up.  The restaurant is beautiful and spacious with a lot of natural light filtering in through the large windows.  We didn't get to experience the live jazz music but I am sure if we had made reservations for later than 11 AM we would have been able to experience the live music.  The food was pretty good.  My favourites from the buffet were the bacon and the chocolate filled pastry.  Although the bacon was a little salty, it was the perfect amount of crispy.  As for the chocolate filled pastry, my european friend told me that they were just like the ones in Paris.  How fancy!    The guy in line in front of me seemed to really enjoy the eggs benedict because he smacked his lips when he saw them and took 3.  I thought it was just okay.  Juice is extra but coffee is complimentary.    The buffet costs $25ish and may be a little over priced for the quantity and quality of food but on par for the atmosphere and classy type feeling of the restaurant.  The restaurant is very accommodating to kids and babies.  This would be a great place to take a date!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was a pretty good place to come for lunch with a date or a group of friends. I ordered the porchetta sandwich while my boyfriend got the duck poutine. My sandwich was delicious, and extremely filling, I couldn't even finish my fries at the end. My boyfriend's poutine was also great, and although it looks like a small amount, it was also very filling according to him (however the duck had some gaminess to it still, so if you're uncomfortable with that, maybe you should avoid it). However, although what we ordered was pretty good, the complimentary bread was really disappointing. Incredibly tough, almost as if it was reheated after it was stale or something. In addition, the fries and ketchup was kind of boring. For the price that i was paying, I was expecting something like homemade ketchup, or at least fries that weren't so reminiscent of Swiss Chalet fries. Also, I'm not sure if the level of service at the restaurant quite lives up to what was implied by the price and atmosphere of the restaurant. Nonetheless, I would still return to this restaurant occasionally, but I probably won't go out of my way to do so. However I do recommend eating on the patio here, 'cause it's really lovely with comfy sofas, canopies shielding you from the sun, and colourful decor!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in distillery district and I loved it. I really enjoyed our romantic dinner at Boiler house. The food was good (still doesn't trump Colbourne Lane and Canoe) but that may be cause we had the summerlicious menu. I ordered my steak medium and my husband ordered it medium well but both were cooked the same. We sat in a narrow log cabin type booth and I loved it - it was very intimate. The place was bustling but it added to the entire industrial - chic experience. Staff was quite efficient. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food, including one of the best steaks I have had this year, and a friendly attentive waiter made for a great pre-show dinner."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and large food selection made this $24.95 brunch buffet worth it.  We had made a reservation for 4 and seated in a great booth. Our server immediately brought us coffee and water. If you're looking to splurge, the minimum price for a bottle of wine was over $100, so we passed.  Lots of variety to pick in the buffet line. First the salads: garden, chickpea, beets, potato, macaroni with pesto sauce. For the mains, there was plenty of potatoes, scrambled eggs, bacon (regular and peameal), waffles, french toast, sausages, etc. Even lunch foods were available - pasta, chicken, etc.  Pastries lined the entire bar so there was no shortage of danishes, biscuits, cinnamon rolls, or croissants.  Usually, I don't expect a lot of dessert selection but I was impressed with the choices here - mini creme brulees, chocolate mousse tarts, apple crisp, mango tarts, macaroons, brownies, and other cookies/squares galore!  Service was fantastic. Our waiter made sure we always had plenty of coffee/tea and water.   Would definitely return for special occasions."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere of this place. Live music (they played the Beatles...brownie +++ points), awesome food, and good company! What more can you ask for. The2 person booths are really cool, kind of gives you a feeling of having your own little room. Ordered the 10oz black angus striploin and the tea smoked muscovy duck breast...both amazing! Surprised myself by cleaning the plate. You should reserve in advance because it does get quite popular on weeknights. There was outdoor seating but unfortunately it wasn't open when we went. There were also tables on the 2nd floor which I'd like to be next time because that's where the band plays from. Overall, I would love to visit this place again!"}
{"text":"I went last year on New Year's Day for the 1st time and I loved it . Great food , Amazing atmosphere and  really enjoyed  the live band . We booked a 10 am reservation which was good cuz i noticed once we were leaving at 2 it was starting to get really busy . I will be going back again this year even if a bit pricey one a yr of gluttony brunch is so worth it !!!"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to book a company dinner here and was incredibly pleased with the professionalism of the staff, quality of food, variety of alky, and GREAT decor. Especially great place to host an event during a nice, warm summer day. Definitely go for a buy out and enjoy the outdoor seating.   If you're planning on booking a corporate event at the Boiler House, Stacy is THE person to work with. Tight budget? No worries! Stacy will work around your budget to ensure your guests will have the best possibly experience. She'll even hook you up with a live band.   Food stations were the hit of the night... from the oyster bar (totally emptied the place out!), to the beef tenderloin and the desserts, I was really pleased how everything tasted great.   I must add that the staff was absolutely great with the guests. They were friendly, helpful and fun to hang out with. Excellent hosts!"}
{"text":"I've got one word for you.  BRUNCH!  I lied. I have another word for you. BUFFET! Mmmm mmmm sooooo goooood...   If you eat and breathe brunch as much as I do then put Boiler House on the top of your list!   Equipped with an omelet station, carving station and waffle station, but wait, THERE'S MORE! Tables and tables of food still follow with seafood, different styled eggs, french toast, perogies, salads, cheese and cured meats, continental breakfast goodies, mini desserts and more and more and even MORE!   Someone must have been listening to my brunch wish list and that someone must be working in the Boiler House!   As you continue to go back for your third, fourth or fifth serving, you'll also enjoy the jazz sounds from a live band, charming and classy service and splendid decor.   Not once has the group of us been rushed out and trust me, my friends and I can EAT and carry a never ending conversation.  I recommend wearing elastic band waisted pants (though I haven't owned a pair since grade 3) to accommodate your too-full belly after consuming brunch here or at least wear pants that you can undo the top button on."}
{"text":"This place is a real conundrum.  The decor, ambiance...perfect.  The brunch...whatever.  I have had way better brunch at much better prices.  I would go to Le Gourmand, Boom Breakfast, Hot House, etc instead.  I am glad I went as it was with a bunch of Yelpers, but I had higher expectations for a place that cost so much.    I do want to return to try dinner/drinks.  Hopefully my update review will be higher in stars."}
{"text":"OMG- This place has amazing Surf and Turf-  One steak, mashed potatoes and three shrimp. It was sooo good and I was stuffed!!! The staff were great. I was thinking of that meal the next morning!"}
{"text":"This one's a bit of a toughie... The picture alone makes it look amazing. And it is, in terms of the decor, the architecture, the environment and the location, yet I'm torn about whether Boiler House deserves a great rating. Reason being; I've been there twice and had one good, and one not-so-good experience.      The first time was for a light snack in the upstairs gallery during the Toronto Jazz Festival. The music and the atmosphere was great!   However, the second time I was there I was disappointed. I ordered the veggie lasagna and it was meekly sub-par at best. The waiter wasn't very friendly and I was surprised at the service, considering my initial take on it. I think it is fair to say that The Boiler House is a great venue for parties and special events, but I'd have to try it a third time to truly give an opinion about it as a regular dining establishment.   Maybe I caught them on a bad day? All in all, I'd recommend it and I hope to increase my rating soon!"}
{"text":"((this review was done about a year ago, and on my blog. I wanted to transfer it over))  After at least 2 years of noticing this restaurant, I finally got a chance to try it on the weekend.   In the heart of the distillery district, the Boiler House has a very industrial feel, but at the same time warm and inviting. 2 levels of the restaurant, allow for lots of space and tables, but not the most practical with the buffet station down below. tip: request a table on the bottom floor (I think we were just lucky)  On the upper floor, a live jazz band intermittently play music. Although noisy, it's keep the vibe of the restaurant, and I believe due to the high ceilings, the noise drowns out, and still can carry on a conversation with my friend, her daughter and our moms.   At around $25 per person (and $12.95 for under 12), there was excellent choice in the buffet, and the food wasn't too shabby. I can't say it was amazing quality, but it was very good and lots of variety.   My only complaint was when we sat down and I was asked what to drink. I said, a coffee, and a hot water (to Waiter #1).  After about 10 mins, I noticed that everyone else had coffee, but I didn't. So I assumed the guy forgot. Another waiter came around and asked about juices. I asked for a hot water. Waiter #1 came back with a coffee and left. Waiter #2 came back with a teapot of hot water and left. I hailed Waiter #2 soon after and asked him for a mug. He looked at me confused. I'm like, where do you want me to drink the hot water? Disgruntled, he left. Then Waiter #1 came back with a tall glass mug full with hot water. Then Waiter #2 came back with a mug and left it on the table.  I was a poor child with 5 different drinks on the table and very confused.   Other than that, the food was good and atmosphere was good.  The potatoes were very good, the way I like them. Crunchy on the outside, and soft in the inside. The Eggs Benedict was okay. More hollendaise would have been nice, and it was a bit cold when I got around to it.  Bacon = yum. Scrambled eggs were good too.  There was also a french toast. My mom got a small plate and filled it with maple syrup so that when she has her french toast, it wouldn't mix with the rest of the food on her plate. The syrup sat in front of me at the empty spot on the table. The 1st time, one waiter took it, and I said, we're not done with that. The 2nd time, the waiter asked before trying to take it. The 3rd time, this lady took it and didn't even ask or turn back. It wasn't until my mom angrily told her that that was her syrup, and she brought us back a teapot full of it. Poor service? Good service? I don't know, but should ask before whisking away someone's plate.  They also had an omelet stand, make-your-own, and a waffle stand , which I didn't get a chance to try  Roast beef and ham were very good. The ham was crusted on top like a suckling pig. A rose pasta, mushy perogiess, and a greek salad.  They also had pastries, bread and criossant. I had an egg bread, but it was hard.  They also had fruit in additino to the yummy dessert.  The little merigune tart was very good. Lemon, and not a rock hard meriengue. Apple crumble tart, and a lemon and chocolate custard tart. The cookie was a ginger sugar cookie, with perfect softness in the middle, and crunchy outsides. Pecan pie, and chocolate pie was amazing. If you like moussey, the chocolate pie was rich and delicious.  Very parent/kid friendly. Date friendly too."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, the waiters are very nice and service over all is fantastic.  What ruined it for us was that the chef didn't get any of our meats right. If it wasn't overcooked, it was undercooked.  It was 7 of us at the table and not one order came out right.  I stuck with my meat anyway but some people at our table even sent it back to the chef.  However, the Manager felt awful and gave us free deserts for everyone plus half off on the entire bill so that was great.  Desert was amazing! I would come back a second time though, it deserves another chance."}
{"text":"Came here after hearing my friend paint a glowing image of the distillery districts food and uniqueness.  We spent time at the bar while waiting for our table to be cleared and got a few drinks which were a little spendy but made well with top shelf ingredients. I don't too much mind paying extra if a drink is made in this fashion. We were sat shortly after starting our drinks, which worked out quite well and the bartender said they could put the drinks on our dinner tab which was a nice change of pace from these places that say they need you to pay at the bar first.  The server was friendly and knew all her specials without hesitation, she managed to ask all our questions in short simple answers as to not confuse anymore than one may already be. My friend ordered the duck and I ordered the lasagna. I later came to find out that it wasn't lasagna at all, but a squash lasagna-like dish, I wasn't too thrilled about this but I ate it anyway and it had good flavor. The duck was fantastic and I immediately lamented that I wasn't chewing on that instead. All in all it was a great experience and we had a lovely dinner. The bathrooms here are well kept and are like little hotel rooms in and of themselves. Very nice place for a romantic night out."}
{"text":"I lurrrrrrrrrrrrrve the Distillery District !  Happen to stumble upon the Boiler House when I was walking around this area with my friend. At the time, we both had something to eat already so we didn't go in to dine. The staff were telling me about their brunch so I decided to buy a gift card for my brunch-loving father as a Christmas pressie.   Came here this afternoon with pops and we enjoyed our experience here. Service was excellent - coffee came around as soon as we finished our last sip of the cup. We loved the variety of items that were available. A nice touch to our experience was the jazz band playing throughout our meal.  I want to come back for dinner ."}
{"text":"Break it down!  First impression slates the venue as 4.5 star impressive.  This place is massive.  Super high ceilings, original structure, beautiful bar, expansive wine rack, and a warm, romantic ambience set up the evening for something special.  A particularly good choice for a date venue.  The hostesses greet at the door with charm and willing accommodations, in stark contrast to a brief visit to Pure Spirits across the street.  (Yeah, that's right.)   The menu serves up a pleasant array of dishes.  I opted for the black cod dish, and my date, the halibut feature.  Service was modest.  The food, modest, as well.  Appropriate, however, forgettable.  Did I order the wrong dish?  Was the Ahi Tuna the correct choice?  One will never know. All I figure, is that for the ambience, and associated ticket, the food should present as far warmer (arrived warm, but not hot), tastier, and far more creative.  A passing grade, at 3 stars, but not a stellar one.     And so, this brings me to my final commentary- I ordered up the \"Boiler House Teaser\" for dessert.  A pleasant surprise, a small sampling of 4 baby desserts landed on the table.  Annhhh.  Cute.  I excitedly crammed the little macaroon into my date's mouth, and it completely crumbled, in shards, all over him and the table.  Stale!  Really stale!  Shame on you, Boiler House!  Although the remainder of the sampler was enjoyable, the stale macaroon is what really stands out.     I'd return here for drinks, the atmosphere, and the staff, however, I'd make plenty sure I was fed, first."}
{"text":"I went here for Sunday brunch with a group of friends. The interior of this place is great so if you are a fan of old industrial buildings turned into trendy urbanite hang outs this place will not disappoint.  The food here for brunch was pretty good, but I don't eat red meat so the beef brisket, bacons and sausages were a loss to me. They do however offer smoked salmon and custom made omelets. Like a dunce I loaded up my plate with food before I realized this, and had to eat a few other things first before I could go get the stuff I really like.  If I HAD taken the time to look at everything they had out for the brunch buffet first, then I would have known to to grab all the smoked salmon, taken it to the custom omelet guy and asked him to make me an omelet so overflowing with smoked salmon that I'd look like a ravenous grizzly bear as I ate it.   Alas, I did not do this and ended up looking like a regular sunday bruncher.   They have a jazz band playing on the mezzanine (nice touch, and a regular fixture I believe)  Also, the deserts rotate, so if you see something you like, don't necessarily expect it will be there next time you go for your desert plate.  And most importantly, Mimosa's are $10! Nothing comes as a bigger surprise than seeing your brunch was $25, and the modest sized refreshing side beverage increases the damage on your bill by 40%. If I'm paying 10 bucks for a Sunday brunch mimosa is should come in a Hoegarden pail, and the waiter should leave my table with a back problem after it's arrival.   r"}

Their red meats were good, but their seafood was better. their wine list was pretty good, also. Bit pricey, I had thought, but other than that, it was wonderful."}
{"text":"This place is a great date spot and I also hear they serve a kick ass SUnday brunch buffet. For whatever reason you come here, you won't be disappointed.  Located in the Distillery District, this restaurant manages to merge contemporary style with industrial strength. Brick and beam are exposed everywhere, like in other places in this area, with super high vaulted ceilings but it's all melded together with contemporary glass dividers, lounge chairs, and minimalistic tables. The long distressed wood bar gives this place a nice touch and feel.  The staff are extremely attentive and are some of the most funny and courteous in the city. They make this place feel welcoming and take away from the pretentious aura the decor may give off.   Food here is spectacular with flavors you want to savor all day and a level of cooking that will melt in your mouth. The prices are a little steep for what you get but when the flavors touch your lips you will temporarily forget about how much you are paying. Drinks here are also pricey so be prepared to drop a pretty penny.  Overall, this place would have made my top 10 in the city if the prices weren't so steep. You can't have it all, I guess. Great ambiance in an even greater location. Come here for lunch/brunch in the summer and catch some of the nearby art exhibits and local bands playing. The prices are a little steep for what you get but if you feel in the mood for a little splurge, this may be it."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, atmosphere and overall experience!  I love the Boiler House. I've been here about 3 times now, first visit was during Winterlicious a few years back and I have always have a positive experience! Everyone is on the ball, the food has been top-notch and the classical guitar playing during dinner my last time there made the experience all the more pleasant and memorable. I only have positive things to say about this fantastic restaurant."}
{"text":"On our first night in Toronto, I decided it would be nice to explore the Distiller District area. Seems like a chill place to walk around and enjoy a nice dinner. And it was, but we paid for it. Pricey!   I ordered the blackened cod...and I could barely manage to find the pieces on my plate. Oh, I should mention I was starving because we drove up from Cleveland and had been saving our stomachs for a nice Toronto dinner. As a dietitian, I'm big on portion control, but this portion size of cod was just plain cheap. My protein portion was definitely smaller than the size of my palm (and I have small palms, mind you)...or even a deck of cards, if you will. Needless to say, that meal alone wouldn't have filled me up. Thank goodness I had a beer by my side to help fill the void. Another dish would have cost me an arm.   My boyfriend got a pork chop dish, which was more substantial. He said it was ok, but didn't really rave about it.   For over $25 a pop, you're paying more for the scenery and the atmosphere than the food. I can see why people like it there- it's beautiful and a nice place but if you're looking for food..I'd say don't eat here."}
{"text":"So if you're looking for a place to stuff yourself with AMAZING food on a Sunday morning, then the Boiler House is where you want to be.  My friend kept on takling about how amazing this place, and I thought he was just hyping it up for me.  However, Boiler House lived up to and surpassed my expectations.  The patio was gorgeous - however, our reserved seats were inside with the amazing food.  Due to our reservations, we got an awesome seat downstairs conveniently located near the brunch buffet.  Food included a vast amount of different varieties: pasta salads, pasta, egg benedict, sausage, bacon, danishes, smoked salmon (my favourite!), omelette station, etc.  Goodness gracious, I had a food baby by the end of the meal.  Desserts were great as well!  Service was impeccable.  The waitress came by every once in a while to refill our water or coffee, and the bus-boys came by to pick up our dishes quickly once they saw that we were done.  A great addition to this was the jazz band that was playing.  I love crooners, and I just died when they played a bunch of my favourites.  Only problem is that it's a bit pricey.  It's about $25 per person, but I mean, if you're planning to eat at an AYCE or buffet, it's pretty much the similar price, right?  Located in the Distillery District, you can spend the afternoon walking around on a nice sunny day :)"}
{"text":"Been here for brunch on a couple of occasions in the summer time years back.  Both times were very memorable as the company, the atmosphere, the ambiance, the food - all brought together made for a enjoyable occasion.  The food selection is very good and plentiful - restocked on a frequent basis. I was hard pressed to decide what I wanted to eat, because it all looked so good.  The waitstaff was very attentive and friendly.  My favourite part was the live jazz ensemble playing on the upstairs balcony. Sitting in the front seating area (near the bar/buffet and entrance) downstairs made for a very nice view of the jazz group.  This is top of my list for a Sunday brunch occasion with good company."}
{"text":"The Boiler House is a beautiful restaurant.  I love the decor, I love the building, it makes me want to get married again and host it there.  It is truly lovely.  I went with the wonderful Yelpers for our book club meeting here.  There was a very nice jazz band playing.....really quite close to us actually..... which essentially made book clubbing impossible.  But if I was to come here for a brunch-date it would have been perfect (especially if we sat further away from the band!)  The staff was very attentive, and Kat T even managed  to smack one on the bottom (I missed the complete details due to the loud music.)  Who doesn't want to go to a place where you can smack bottoms? Really now.  The reason I'm only giving it 3 stars is that I didn't find the food that impressive to make it worth $25.  The buffet offerings were okay, but nothing that made my squeal (or moan) in delight.  I had an omlette from the omlette station, which got stuck to the pan and had a well-done (read: burnt) look to it.  For some reason I also had it in my mind that beverages would be included, and altho perhaps coffee was juice was not, which I found disappointing.    Brunch is my favourite meal of the day/week.  I can't even begin to describe how much I enjoy this meal (check out my description of brunch at Bonjour Brioche).  The food wasn't worth the price, but it is a really gorgeous venue that I might bring tourist friends to for a relaxing meal."}
{"text":"Beautiful rustic building, live jazz music and a buffet brunch with table service, I couldn't ask for anything more in a brunch place!  The food selection includes non-traditional items such as carved meats, perogies and pasta salad.  What's truly amazing is their dessert selection, which is a full offering of cakes, pastries and waffles with assorted toppings.  I didn't even know that desserts with brunch was a thing!  Just a note that The Boiler House is in the Distillery District, and parking is sometimes difficult to find.  They also sometimes have events, so I recommend calling ahead."}
{"text":"Perhaps I'm being nice, but there was just nothing wrong with our evening here. It was our Christmas dinner, if you will, prior to the barrage of family things, so we were already in a great mood. Our server, Chris, was very knowledgeable and a whole lot of fun. The food was amazing. Having just come from a quick stop at Soma, we skipped appetisers and went straight to the steak. The rib-eyes (we both ordered them) were perfect and the sides were awesome. I am, I must say, a sucker for beets. I had the sorbet trio for dessert and my wife went with the Brie. Truly delightful.   What I loved as much as the food was the decor. I love the Distillery District for its architecture and design. The Boiler House does not disappoint at all. The ambience was spectacular and not too loud. The flamenco guitarist was quite good and just made the while atmosphere relaxes. I particularly enjoyed his rendition of 'We Wish You a Merry Christmas.'   It was by no means an inexpensive evening, but for a special night out, the Boiler House is a great place to choose. Just dress warmly for the walk back to the subway."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm going to cheat a bit on this review and borrow some wording from their website.  It has an industrial chic setting. The restaurant's award winning design includes a 22 foot wine rack, intimate private rooms and hand crafted heavy timber tables. Free live Jazz Thurs through Sat nights or the famous Jazz brunch every Sunday.  We were there for lunch just as the patio was opening.  Even though they were still trying to set up, we were warmly greeted by the patio staff, which was a nice change from the indoor hostess who was extremely rude and ignorant.  Thank goodness we didn't just walk away due to her horrible service, and ended up meeting some really great employees there.  The pictures online of the patio show your basic patio table with blue umbrellas, but they must be old as the patio had a European design, all white, cushy, and tent-like.  A very nice place in the Distillery District.  Check it out."}
{"text":"We went for winterlicious this year, and it has been one of my best winterlicious experiences to date.  Many restaurants are crowded, rush you out or t he food isn't that great because they are so busy.   At Boiler House they accommodated our request to change seats and were very good about it!  Seems like all the staff is in sync so the they help eachother out when they are busy so there is never a blip in the service. The food: Had the potato leek puree with a truffle sauce and it was delicious.  For my entree I had the steak, the first time it was a tad overdone and I wasn't planning to send it back, but they insisted and got me another one.  Steak and potatoes were great, with a mushroom sauce.  My dessert was the panna cotta, which wasn't the best but was still good. Overall service was wonderful.  Even though it was winterlicious and they were busy they did not rush us out.  We had coffee and relaxed after dinner. I would definitely come back here, because the service was phenomenal."}
{"text":"The interior design is the best part of the experience here-- we chose on of the tiny pine booths perched like a line of love nests. Acoustics for conversation were nice.   The maitre d' was professional.  Points of contention:  - Our server sneakily upsold us into a 1/2 liter of sauvignon blanc that cost more than buying by the individual glass...hm. Economics 101, anyone?  - My cod was OK, the beach mushrooms were delicious, but overall the dish was so salty that my engagement ring won't fit on my bloated sausage finger tomorrow, for sure. Salt and butter taste good, don't get me wrong.   - I told the server of my gluten intolerance, and yet I was served an encrusted amouse bouche-- sketchy! He seemed to forget of the wheat allergy when offering table bread and during our dessert ordering. Given that the place was half full, it could hardly have been too much to remember.   My fiancee's pork chop with caramelized onions was yum and served with a hot pot of adorable gnocchi that were almost too cute to eat-- I just wanted to coo at them and how chewy they looked. \"Sigh, gluten!\"  The bill was over $150, and I didn't even have a starter. And we both had only 1 glass of wine. I suppose we paid for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing Sunday Brunch Buffet, although bit costly, def. the best brunch selection and quality.  Excellent quality food, open-concept, artistic interior design.   Awesome service."}
{"text":"Attended a wedding there.  Food bland and not served piping hot the way I like it.  Bathrooms could have been attended to more often during the event - lack of attention to this important detail is off putting.  The actual venue itself is nice.  Overall ... meh."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch at the Boiler House is at the top of my list, and had I the means, I would eat there every Sunday. So yes, it is pricey, like $25 per person for a beautiful buffet, (not including your drinks) but the surroundings are so beautiful, and the live jazz keeps me grooving in my seat, relishing my day off over perfect eggs benny and caprese salad. I don't even like scrambled eggs but I will eat them here and enjoy every bite. All your breakfast classics are present and presented in a tidy buffet that is civilized and well stocked. French toast, plump sausages, cooked bacon, fruit and cheeses, lox, prime rib, all kinds of yummy salads with eggplant or pasta and chicken, cherry tomatoes and zucchini, portugese tarts, pecan pie, brownies and so much more for dessert too. I have never been disappointed. Yes, you should make a reservation a week in advance just to be safe, especially if you are bringing an entourage. Lots of little kids with more expensive wardrobes than myself but hey, I don't judge, I'm there for the food, the mimosas and the live music. My dream brunch come true."}
{"text":"People love this place, but i am biased towards it.   I had one terrible terrible terrible experience and the boiler house is slowly making up for it in my personal sense.  I've been about 4 times now.  My first time was when disaster struck. I was with a group, and they messed up many things including the timing of our food (half got the food while half were already done), ENTIRELY not accommodating vegetarians simple because it wasn't on the menu prepared for the night, messing up our wine bottle orders and refusing to fix it because they opened the wrong bottles, terrible attitude from the server, and the of course waiter loosing our birthday cake that was specially made to order, and then screwing up the bill to include a bar bill that wasn't ours and ofcourse the wrong wine again.  In the end, and after much debate, we decided not to tip the waiter at all and explained this to the manager (a decision that was very hard to make), only to have him later call us on the phone number we made a reservation with to tell us off. Terrible.   Since then i have been back for dinners and a wedding. All in all, i have to say, it's good food and great ambience. The venue is a little strange for a wedding personally, but it's industrial feel makes it different from all the regular stuff.  I appreciate the jazz factor alot, but it makes it less intimate with friends. That being said, a little vino and you've got yourself a great night. The boiler house wouldn't be the same if it weren't in the distellery and thats the only reason i've been back (despite my initial boycott)."}
{"text":"Jeremiah suggested The Boiler House for our much needed and highly anticipated catch-up date. He promised me delicious cocktails with the option to snack on light apps. He could have suggested any dive bar or coffee shop in the city, and I would have still been just as excited to see him.   Reservations were made for 10 pm, though we arrived early at 930 pm. Our table, however, was ready for us and we were seated promptly in a comfy corner booth. As with all old friends, we began to chit chat animatedly, while neglecting our menus. Our server seemed nice at first*, allowing us to take our time with our drink orders and answered all of our questions regarding food.  * There might have been a slight edge in our server's voice later on as we went along our leisure way.. but, she didn't push us out the door either. Jeremiah talks a lot. I talk a lot. We haven't seen each other in nearly 2 years. Enough said.  Noshed on:  - French fries with an aioli mayo dip: The fries weren't crispy enough but the aioli made up for it. - Crispy crab sticks: I didn't taste any crab. Looked and tasted more like a veggie spring roll. Not too memorable, partly because I felt like I was tricked thinking I'd be getting crab. - Truffled Yukon and Parmesan gnocchi with baby carrots and chicken gravy: The gravy consumed the gnocchi. Note to self: gravy on the side. Gnocchi was cooked to perfection -- melted instantly.  Sipped on:  - Boiler House bourbon cocktail with honey lemon: DELICIOUS. Times 2.  Loved the space. As with many buildings in the Distillery District, the renovated, industrialized buildings of old are now chic, romantic, and beautifully decorated. There was also a live jazz trio up top on the second level, which overlooks the ground floor. The sky-high wooden beams and 22-foot high wine rack behind the bar continued to heighten the already lofty space, yet kept the atmosphere homey.   Catch-up with friends or bring a date. In this instance, I did both. The server wasn't all too keen later in the evening but she also didn't fuss. The area is great to wander and walk during the day, but during the evenings, it gets pretty quiet. By 1130pm on our way out, there weren't many people in sight. I should note, however, that although I love this part of town, it's not all that easy to get to. From Bloor to Mill Street, taxi fare cost me $12. FYI."}
{"text":"This is great place to have a snack,desert, beer or glass of wine and catch some live jazz music. It has a great open concept with lots exposed brick and beams. Its like being in a rennovated 'barn'. The service is friendly and they have a great selection of beers and wines. I had some wings and a cheese sampler tray. I don't know if I would have a full dinner here, but if you are looking for a place to unwind and listen to some great live music, The Lester McLean Band is a frequent musical act here, and they were the main reason I came back."}
{"text":"Best beet salad in TO. Point. It's a charming restaurant for a relaxing dinner with a significant other or a good friend. You are guaranteed an amazing food, well paired wine and may be some live music if you're lucky. I find the place to be cozy, yet elegantly styled and it is so nice to sit inside while the outside world is torn apart by another hurricane or snowstorm. Sit down, relax, enjoy the food and forget everything else, that is how to dine at Boiler House."}
{"text":"I just finished having New Year's Day brunch at the Boiler House.   We booked this place because a) not many places were open for brunch on New Year's Day and b) we wanted something slightly more upclass than usual.  The building itself in beautiful and the live jazz is a nice touch. Our booth for 4 was large, elegant and comfortable and it truly was a great place to sit and chat.  On New Year's Day and every Sunday the Boiler House has a buffet breakfast. They have a carvery station with fresh peameal and roast beef, a station with waffles and made-to-order omelettes, some salads, peel and eat shrimp, perogies, bacon, scrambled eggs, fruit, veggies, eggs benedict, roast potatoes, smoked salmon, meats and cheeses are a decent sized dessert selection.  Sadly, none of the food is very good. It's not horrible, but nothing was outstanding. The eggs benny lacked sauce and was bland, everything was quite bland. The only delicious items were the smoked salmon and one of the cheesecake desserts I sampled.   The service was a bit slow as well. We had pre-booked but had to wait 10 mins for our table to be ready. The coffee top ups were a bit slow too but not terribly bad.  The All-You-Can-Eat buffet brunch comes to $28 after taxes, which included coffees and juice.   I would go back again just for the decor and ambiance but the brunch buffet food was completely forgettable."}
{"text":"Food - great selection and tasty.  VERY well worth the $19.99 ... I actually have no idea what you other cheap-asses are bitching about ... I'd pay $30 for this brunch.  Hostess - an absolute condescending tart ... get a grip boiler house people ... this is the first impression to your supposedly awesome restaurant.  From the reviews on here, the service was my only concern - and it was shi!t right from walking in.    Waiter - he was actually excellent ... mind you I caught the drift he was giving me the eye of the tiger."}
{"text":"I came here for a work function, so I can't speak much to the menu or the cost, as everything as taken care of (is there anything better than free food and drinks? anything?) but the food I had was fantastic and the space is beeee-yoooooo-tee-ful! Very rustic and charming, lots of wood everywhere and two levels with a bar on each floor. There were food stations set up all around, I think the theme was \"Canadian Road Trip\" so each station offered something distinct to each province. From what I can remember, the french fries were really good. Also - there is Sapporo on tap! I had a lot of fun at the Boiler House, highly recommended for social functions!"}
{"text":"Came here during the summer, and the ambiance was amazing. Little booths surrounded by light curtains. Even the inside was nice and breezy, lots of natural light. Found the place to be on the expensive side, but would go there again. Server was great and attentive. I would defintely go back to try their brunch."}
{"text":"Boiler House's brunch is expensive (I believe it's $25 flat) but the amount of food you get for an enjoyable, relaxing experience is worth it for a treat once in a while. I often head to Boiler House for a \"group\" brunch as it's one of the few venues in the city that's large enough to accommodate larger crowds without the feeling of being rushed or monopolizing half the dining area.   The staff is attentive and courteous but it's basically self serve from the buffet table - they're there if you need them, but otherwise you are left alone to enjoy your meal. The last time I was there I wanted to take an eggs benedict from the serving platter but they all had peameal bacon on them (I'm vegetarian). The server offered to make a fresh one from the kitchen with tomato and avocado instead, and personally delivered it to my table. Very impressive!  Boiler House is best for a drawn out, lazy Sunday morning brunch experience - not for something quick and no-frills.  Watch out for the mimosas...they're really tasty but they add up quickly on your bill!!"}
