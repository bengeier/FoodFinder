{"text":"Well know restaurant in Port Credit. Recently renovated. Staff tries hard but sometimes too many patrons make it hard to  keep up. Some nights the food is fantastic other nights just okay. Depends on which chef is working. On weekends call ahead for a reservation but during the week restaurant is usually empty. Worth a try."}
{"text":"After dining here the other night, all I have to say is...

DEEP FRIED RISOTTO BALLS! YOU MUST try them! Who's ever idea it was to deep fry risotto is a genius!  I must meet this person and shake their hand.

Everything else we consumed was mediocre. We also had the calamari, the house fried oysters and the sweet potato frites with wasabi mayo. Plus I had 2 (just okay) martinis.

Service was a little on the slow side, but the waitress was ultra friendly. Which makes up for the stall to our attention.

But I would go back, just for the tasty, impressive deep fried risotto balls. That's how worth your while they will be!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here the other day.  Food was decent.  The calamari was tasty.  Gnocchi was good.  Tenderloin was well cooked and tender but not very flavourful.  Service on this occasion was awful. server dropped a knife into our laps twice, forgot our drinks, mixed up some of our order, and then assumed that change was not necessary and was rude when we asked for the receipt and change...20% on shoddy service?!? hmmm...i think not.  We were there a couple of months ago and the server was excellent.  So consistency of service is suspect."}
{"text":"Place completely botched a reservation that my girlfriend's mother had made weeks in advance for her 70th birthday party.

We showed up for the large dinner to discover that they had construction going on in the restaurant and intended to seat a party of 7 at a bar table and endure the sound of the construction nearby.  

You'd think the restaurant would either A: not take large group sized dinner reservations if you have construction going on, OR B: call your customers to inform them of this issue.

We ended up not staying for dinner and went down the street to Breakwater and had a fantastic meal in a beautiful restaurant."}
