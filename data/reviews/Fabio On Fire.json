{"text":"Friendly service and A-mazing pizza! Ingredients fresh and bursting with flavor. We tried the Capricciosa pizza and was very happy with out choice. Authentic Italian flavors in Peoria. Highly recommend coming in for lunch or dinner. Perfect date night location."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been dying to try Fabio's since we discovered it a few weeks ago. We went there on a Saturday around 2:30 and there was already a wait. When we checked in with the hostess, she was super nice and gave us menus to look at while we were waiting for our table. Before we were seated, Fabio (the owner) came over and introduced himself and thanked us for coming in. Now on to the food. We started with the Burrata and it was so light and refreshing. For entrees, we ordered the 4 cheese gnocchi and the Tarantina pizza. Gnocchi was light and fluffy and the pizza was probably the best in the valley. Very light and chewy, perfectly cooked. Tiramisu and cannolis for dessert and I hate to repeat myself, but the tiramisu was by far the best I've had. Cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure Fabio thinks my husband and I are stalking his restaurant, as we've been in to eat 4 times in the last couple weeks!  I promise we're not, we just LOVE the food.  We have needed restaurants like this on our side of town for a long time, and Fabio on Fire delivers!  I have tried a little bit of everything, and everything is quality and delicious.  I especially love the burrata appetizer, the raviolis and pizza!  I've had the butternut squash ravioli and a special ravioli with short ribs.  Divine!  Perfect pizza, and they even have a homemade gluten free pizza crust that tastes like regular pizza.  You will not go wrong eating at Fabio on Fire, and I'm guessing you will become a regular like me.  Thank you Fabio and staff for a wonderful place to proudly call our own in Peoria!"}
{"text":"Fabio on fire is a much needed Italian restaurant on the west side. The owner and the staff are all originally from Italy. All their dishes are homemade. The pasta dishes are truly some of the best we've ever had. I had the veal ravioli and my son had the lobster ravioli which had chunks of lobster in the sauce. All the pasta is homemade. My husband had the pizza which gives Bianca's a run for their money. We also had the meatball appetizer which had just been freshly made."}
{"text":"Such a great little spot!  Our favorite place to dine and relax.  Fabio hit a home run by bringing all his signature dishes here.  Don't go there in a rush for a meal, this is a sit and relax type of dining experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food, authentic Italian, service is great, our server was very courteous and very helpful, all in all it was an excellent experience."}
{"text":"In the merry go round of food trucks, something that isn't fried is worth a shot.  This particular truck is worth a couple shots.  You know...for science. 

I just had a pretty good pizza. From a *truck*.  Big marble slab for the dough prep, I saw the fire in that oven, counter (table?) staff was very helpful and personable, pizza was taaaasty, crust was puffy...win!"}
{"text":"Great food, service and very conscientious on the quality!

Had pizza, lasagna, and ravioli, all excellent!

Rafael was great as server.,,,"}
{"text":"We had the meatball appetizer and veal torteloni today and both were amazing!  The marinara sauce is just like my great grandma used to make. I hope these dishes become regular specials or are added to the menu.  The chocolate chip cannoli was wonderful as well!  We have been waiting for the perfect Italian restaurant for years and we are so glad to now have Fabio on Fire in our area!"}
{"text":"The absolute best Italian food in the U.S. PERIOD! Fabio is an amazazing chef and host, the fresh ingredients, the attention to details, the excellent service just an awesome experience overall..."}
{"text":"Read some reviews for Fabio On Fire and they where some 4's and mostly 5's, so I had to give it a try. I moved to Arizona three years ago and while I'm still happy with my decision, there are a few things about New York City that I miss and a good Italian restaurant is one of them.
Fabio seems to have some growing pains that they will no doubt resolve but the most important reason to go is the food and they have that well conceived and well executed. The menu is small, but there's something for everyone and the specials were so enticing that all three of us went for the special, while saying we'd be back to order some of the menu items that caught our eye. Fabio will see us again 
in the near future."}
{"text":"A great addition to our neighborhood restaurant scene. A real family affair, with tasty home style cooking. It would be a 5 star place when they get the facility up to speed.
Third visit today, continue to be consistently good, even if the facility needs work."}
{"text":"Long overdue to have a great Italian restaurant on the west side. Everything is home made and was amazing. I had the lasagna which was amazing, and my wife had the butternut squash ravioli. Everything was amazing, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"First time eating here and we will be regulars. The food is fantastic and as homemade Italian as you will get. The Butternut Squash Raviolis are tender with a hint of smokey prosciutto but the squash is amazingly sweet. The seafood spaghetti loaded with mussels and shrimp. Mussels were fresh and shrimp were tender. Red sauce was amazing on top of the fresh spaghetti noodles and nice change from the typical white wine sauce. Wood fired pizza which we didn't have this time but my wife had it her last visit and also amazing. Small seating but gives you that family style feel. Must say hello to Franco. Very passionate about serving you the best Italian in Peoria!"}
{"text":"The overall the food is good.  The gnocchi's were out of this world and melt in your mouth.  The pizza had good flavor each time I've ordered it, but the middle of the pizza is not firm therefore, when you try to pick it up to eat or just put on your plate the toppings fall off.  Fabio needs to work on service. He typically does not have enough help.  I would recommend to try, although it is a small restaurant so there maybe a wait.  I suggest going at lunch on the weekends.  So glad to see he is doing well."}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner! Had the butternut squash ravioli, husband had the lasagne. Both were great! Long overdue to have an excellent neighborhood restaurant like this on the west side!! 
Homemade gelato as dessert! Rich and decadent. Took home a box of cookies...fabulous!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. So thankful for an authentic, one of a kind restaurant in our area of town. Service was exceptional. The waitress radiates a passion for the food and kindness."}
{"text":"Ate here the other night for the first time and it was delicious. Had the beef & veil stuffed tortellini, it was excellent. I am very picky with my Italian food and this place will hold up to my high standards! The restaurant is small but we had a party of 6 and got seated immediately. The wait staff is very friendly and the food will keep you coming back."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  This is a fabulous find: a delightful, real Italian restaurant.  Fabio and Jenny obviously take great pride in providing excellent food and hospitality.  The staff is very friendly and welcoming, the service great, the food excellent.  Pizze are thin crust, cooked in a wood fired oven as in Italia. The homemade bread loaves wonderful with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.
The house wines include a sangiovese, a super Tuscan, a chianti, and a primitivo, some of my favorite Italian reds.
Being a small place, it gets full early.  There is an online wait list, which is cool.  I just hope that good reviews won't make it harder for me to get back in!"}
{"text":"Friendly service Great atmosphere...But seriously let's talk about the food...by far THE best Italian restaurant in the west valley.  A little bit pricier than what you might pay for chain Italian ...but what do you expect when it's all homemade by authentic Italians!"}
{"text":"Super cute little restaurant however for the price the value is not there. 5 ravioli for $20. They were decent but not worth it. The focaccia bread was delish. Won't bother going back again."}
{"text":"By far the best Pizza in the valley. Bianco is good. But not Fabio. The crust is crisp and chewy and the Buffalo Mozzarella is flown in fresh from Naples. My new favorite place for Italian. Keep it up Fabio! It's Fabulous."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food.  Great little spot but arrive early, seating is limited. Perfect family run Italian restaurant. Happy that the westside is finally getting better food places!"}
{"text":"This food is wonderful!  We had the lobster ravioli -- very flavorful and the antipasta beforehand was a treat.  We will definitely be returning for this fine dining experience.  Great service, too!"}
{"text":"Excellent---my sister and I tried on the recommendation of my best friend.  I had the special-short rib ravioli--my sister had the butternut squash ravioli:)  One of the best meals I have ever had.  Hers was excellent too."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at Fabio on Fire last weekend. It was recommended to us by someone at Blackstone Country Club. We got there early and were immediately seated, our drink order taken, and bread and olive oil delivered promptly. The menu is a bit anemic. I asked if they had chicken Parmesan-my favorite Italian meal, and the answer was no. I selected the lasagna. Good size portion, excellent sauce. My wife had the butternut squash- she loved it. I would have given 5 stars if the menu were more extensive. At the conclusion of the meal the restaurant was filling up. We will be back, hoping the menu grows as the popularity increases. A final thought - the bread is made on site and is wonderful. Try it, a good place run by good people. I prefer giving my business to the mom and pop, non chain, places. Their name is on the door and know their survival is the goodness of the meals they create. Fabio on Fire does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Impeccable service and deliciously prepared Italian meals.  This is a unique neighborhood gem worth returning or even driving across town.  We found it completely on a whim by looking at nearby restaurants as we left an event at our kids' school.  We were greeted by Fabio who took a moment to meet our family before we were seated.  Our waiter Rafael was charming and a lot of fun.  We really felt like we were family.   We had a delicious bottle of Italian wine at a reasonable price.  The burrata was the amazing (imported from Naples).  Our kids loved the wood fired cheese pizzas.  My wife had the braised short rib ravioli which was so good she wanted a second plate for dessert.  I enjoyed pasta marinara with mussels and shrimp which was among the best I have ever enjoyed in my travels. The Napoleon pastry and strawberry gelato were the proverbial icing on the cake.  Fresh food served by amazing people at a reasonable price.  Fabio even walked us out to thank us for visiting.  We will definitely return.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious!  We just came from our first, but definitely not last, visit to Fabio on Fire. We usually don't go for Italian anyplace except Tomaso's but I had heard good things about Fabio on Fire and it is much closer to our house.  We were not disappointed!  We started with the meat and cheese appetizer platter which was scrumptious, along with the bread they bring. We all had different main meals and we all sampled each other's. My butternut squash ravioli was amazing. My son ate every bit of his beef short rib ravioli, my husband had sausage and broccolini ravioli, our daughter-in-law the tagliatelle bolognase, and our grandson the kids pepperoni pizza. Not one of us said we wouldn't order our meals again. For dessert we tried the cannoli, tiramisu, and a strawberry and a chocolate gelato, and we just passed them all around and made mmmmm, so good noises. We are already planning our next visit!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I never really understood the idea of \"al dente\" or the \"The pasta is not swimming in sauce\" comments you would hear all those cooking shows say.   Having eaten pasta for longer than I care to admit,  I feel as though I've been cheated by the restaurants serving the noodles and goop I have been eating. Now on to the review...

My wife and I went on the advice of friends that recently returned from a three week stay in Italy.  They said that if I wanted real authentic Italian food, then Fabio's is the place for us. So, we went and had buffalo mozzarella and prosciutto salad, spaghetti w/mussels and shrimp, short rib ravioli, and strawberry gelato.  

The cheese and prosciutto were delicious. The pasta was the best I have ever EVER had. I totally get the al dente now. The sauces coated the pasta as opposed to a ladle of red stuff with meat slopped in the middle of flavorless noodles.  So I guess those TV chefs knew all along what pasta is supposed to be, huh?  The strawberry gelato was also perfecto. The kind of OMG I need to sit down before I pass out kind of good.  Yes, it's a tad pricy, and yes it's true that you don't get endless plates of dreck to gorge on, BUT you will get the best tasting meal you may have ever had. No, I don't say that lightly. It really was that good and I plan on going again tomorrow.  

As far as service goes, everyone was super friendly. Fabio came by to introduce himself before the food was even served. Rafael knew every detail of what you were going to eat, and we chatted like old friends about his family.  I had the good fortune of living in Europe while stationed in Germany. The \"service\" was just as I remembered.  No, they don't hover over you and hand you your check before you swallow that last bite. Rather, they treated us like guests. That's how it's done over there.  It's slightly slow by American standards, but I didn't want American-Italian, I wanted Italian-Italian and that is exactly what they gave us. The portion size was also perfect. While the food was so good I wanted to eat more and more and even more; I was full but not painfully so. The bang for your buck IS there in quality not necessarily quantity.  I'm perfectly fine with that."}
{"text":"This place had great service and the food was really good. Definitely hope they stick around because we love supporting local businesses."}
{"text":"Everybody likely knows this place for (usually) long wait lists and maybe even a little frustration with that but it more than balances out with the quality of the dining experience!  The space is limited but the ambiance is intimate and inviting, the staff impeccable (shout out to Franco who always seems to get our table -- we love him!) and the food is authentic and DELISH.  A hidden gem in north Peoria. Love this spot!"}
{"text":"We all enjoyed excellent Margherita pizzas from Fabio on Fire at the Scottsdale Arts Festival. The pizzas were better than many we have had at sit down restaurants here in Arizona.  While the pizzas were on the small side, one pizza was enough for one person."}
{"text":"Five stars and I'd give it 6 if I could. Fine dining food and experience. My wife and I gave this place a try on a recommendation from a friend. We sat at the bar as it was very busy. We wouldn't normally sit at the bar but as it turns out they were great seats we got a little extra bonuses for sitting there!  All the staff were engaging and friendly. They treat everyone as family. You will fall in love with this place on your first visit. Now to the best part, the food. We had lasagne and lobster ravioli. Both we're outstanding we enjoyed them completely. Nice portion sizes quality food and a wonderful ambience!! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Joined another couple at 1:00pm on Saturday afternoon. Was able to get a table right away. I'd heard it wd be a long wait in the evening. We sat on patio. Quiet, clean and comfortable although one person in our party switched from hard wood chair to an upholstered one. In all we had butternut ravioli, lobster and crab ravioli, antipasto plate, pear/arugula salad. ALL were delicious! The bread basket was filled twice we enjoyed it so much!! 
This is definitely a \"go back to\" place!"}
{"text":"Food was really good, and homemade Italian cookies were so fresh and delicious! They definitely need a bigger place. Only seats 25 or so and there is nowhere to wait. 

The owner was very attentive but the inexperience in service brought it down a star. Waiter had to ask if we could sit at the bar and eat. We also had to ask for silverware, napkins and olive oil for the bread. 

I really hope this place makes it! I love local, family owned places, especially when the owner is on site and really appreciates your business."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Over
Priced. Very cramped and small. Kept getting banged into by either patrons or server. Extremely noisy. Will not return."}
{"text":"We wanted to order over the phone and go pick it up so I called,  and the guy who answered the phone was not very friendly and said I couldn't order over the phone because they were slammed and I had to come in to order.... the whole point of ordering on the phone is so I don't have to wait for my order when I get there. Not sure how they will last with customer service like this. Very rude first impression"}
{"text":"First time tonight, great service great food.  The owner Fabio is a great humble host.  Glad to have this in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Hello peeps went to Fabio on Fire tonight and had Butternut Squash Ravioli , hubby had  the Lasagna. The brick oven pizza smelled and looked heavenly as it paraded on by our table .  Everything tasted delicious but was rated a three because service  was just ok ... waiter was friendly and courteous but appetizers were late , salad came with dinner ,not before , waited for our check and was never offered dessert. I highly suggest you make reservation or log onto  their website and put your name on waiting list it gets packed fast .  As always don't take my word for it . Grab your friends and try it out for yourself ! If you go let me know what you think . Buon Appetito"}
{"text":"We lived in Italy for awhile and Fabio's reminds me of how good the food is.   It is authentic more so than any other Italian eatery we have visited in the valley.   Love the raviolis.  Good job!!!"}
{"text":"Brought some friends here to have the same great experience we had when this first opened and this was the WORST service we have had! First,  the server told us his life story before even asking what we would like to drink. Then things went downhill from there,  took forever to get utensils,  we didn't get serving plates until halfway through dinner, never got the serving spoons we had to ask for, and server never came back until bill came and he gave us the wrong bill. Overall,  great food,  HORRIBLE service."}
{"text":"I don't always agree with Dominic Amato but calling Fabio on Fire possibly one of the best new Italian restaurants is RIGHT on. Being a trained chef. I seldom enjoy eating out - until now. The food at Fabio on Fire is prepared the right way - full of flavor and delicious to the last bite. We love it all: appetizers, pizzas, pasta dishes, cookies and desserts. All wonderful! This is the first time in a long time that I'm so excited about eating out and so happy to recommend it to others. Keep up the great job Fabio!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and friendly atmosphere. Truly authentic Italian experience. What is lost in a slight lack of organization is more than made up for with excellence in execution with the dishes. Homemade pasta is out of this world! We also had the gelato which was equally impressive. Fabio personally thanked us and checked in. Really nice guy. Just go!!!"}
{"text":"This is the most amazing Italian restaurant, it is not your typical generic italian, this is like eating from a real italians kitchen. The raviolis are superb and the sauces are some of the best ive had. The pizza's are great also. The staff is hilarious and friendly. The specials dont change too often so if there is one you like you shoukld be able to get it again. There are not many tables, so be sure to call a head or check their website for the wait list."}
{"text":"The food is so good. Fresh and authentic Italian home food. We have eaten there twice and will be back. We have had 2 different pizzas, egg plant, meatballs, meat tray and lobster ravioli and all was amazing. Service is spot on"}
{"text":"Heard lots of positive chatter. Came to try. Will be back soon.  The best Italian in the valley.  The real deal. Try it while you can still get in."}
{"text":"This is the most authentic Italian food i have ever tasted. The service was great as well. Amazing spinach ravioli, it was perfection. For the first date, try a delicioso desert. Tiramisu is the best."}
{"text":"I love this place. Very authentic. Food is marvelous!!  Only complaint is the restaurant is small. I hope they expand!!"}
{"text":"Went here just for desert.... best cannolis in the area!!! Plus the inside is very cute."}
{"text":"Simply the best Pizza in the west side!  Fresh ingredients, amazingly friendly service.  This is crispy, true Italian pizza not the generic American pizza sold everywhere else.  Can't wait to try the ravioli on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Came back to Fabio to dine in and try some other dishes.  It was Saturday night and packed to the gills.  The place is so small it doesn't take very much to fill it up. 

We were sat on the patio with an older gentleman as our waiter.  He was extremely slow.  He moved slow and talked slow and stopped to chat at every table.  

We were getting ready to leave and a younger man brought us some bread.  We ate the bread and still were waiting for the waiter.  Our glasses of water were empty and never refilled.  

Once again ready to leave the waiter finally comes by.  Nice enough fellow but the sense of urgency as a 140 year old 3 legged turtle.

We ordered our food and begin to wait again.  Food finally comes out.  The pizza was amazing.  Great crust, perfectly balanced, fresh ingredients, slightly burnt.  Highly recommend the diavola.

The lobster raviolis were terrible.  The flavor was bland, the lobster was fishy.  Just bad all around.

The salad we ordered was basically arugula with some olive oil and a quarter of a pear sliced up.  This isn't a salad this is the base of a salad.  Where is the rest??

The owner came out to our table and was extremely friendly and nice.  I really wish him well.  He'd be better off putting this waiter as the host and getting someone else in there for starters.

Our bill came out to $80+.  No where near worth that.  I would only come back at this point to order pizzas to go."}
{"text":"Trendy and somewhat chic boutique Italian restaurant for those who like to overpay.  Food is good but certainly not outstanding by any measure.  Very small portions so don't come hungry.  The premeal bread was almost as good as an Olive Garden bread stick."}
{"text":"Truly loved this restaurant! Yes, it is small, but this allows for AMAZING personal customer service. I had the lamb chops...OMG!  SO SO GOOD!   I'm already planning to go back tomorrow. I eat out a lot, and I am very picky. Fabio on Fire checked every box! We were greeted immediately and felt like family by the time we left. They truly know how to make a customer feel special!"}
{"text":"So glad he opened a brick n mortar! I've followed his mobile pizza business 2-3 year ago and it was very good! Pizza is excellent here. 2nd time here this time to try the dinners. Started with the Caprese appetizer, very good mozzarella and tomatoes. My wife had the Eggplant parm which was a special, a bit on the tough side as if they didn't slice it thin enough. I had the Short rib ravioli... homemade Ravioli but the short rib was missing flavor and for $23 i was disappointed!
For dessert it was the Cannoli! Very good! We will be back as this is what the Upper West Side needs"}
{"text":"Nice environment and friendly staff. The food was average at best in my opinion for being \"authentic\". It wasn't bad but not worth the price"}
{"text":"This is the best Italian restaurant I have ever had! Really friendly staff and authentic Italian food!!"}
{"text":"Blown away....basically how I feel about this tiny independent restaurant that now has my undivided attention! A friend told me she heard it was really good, so my husband and I decided to give it a shot. There are very few Italian restaurants in Arizona that are really good. Fabio on Fire is REALLY spectacular!! 
We got there at 4:30 and were told the wait was about 15-20 minutes. We decided to sit at the counter since there were a couple empty chairs there. Actually a great decision, because we were able to chat with Fabio a bit while he was making pizza. We ordered the Bufalina and it was out of this world! The crust was perfectly charred and crisp yet tender, and the cheese, garlic, arugula and balsamic were fresh and delicious! Next came Lasagna and Lobster ravioli. Again, freshness that you can taste and the pastas are so tender! This is pasta the way it's meant to be! We only ate half of our food so we could try dessert. Classic cannoli and Lemon gelato....oh my!! I finally have a local spot that makes perfect cannoli! My heart is happy!! 
Fabio's is officially our go to for great Italian food! A couple pointers-no reservations unless your party is 6 or more and this is a TINY restaurant so be prepared for a wait. But trust me on this one...it is more than worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"There's no doubt that Fabio on Fire creates dishes that are outstanding AND unusually sophisticated for casual Italian dining. 

There is a wide variety of authentic pizzas -- and even one \"American style\" pizza. All are fabulous, and if you let your taste-bud-desire be your guide you won't be disappointed.

But the best dishes are not the pizzas -- but the pastas. On my last visit I had the short rib ravioli, and others at my table had lobster ravioli. The handmade pasta was cooked to perfection and the seasoning was spot on.  The house red wine is a notch or two above the normal as well.

The servers are congenial, mostly Italian, and food lovers themselves...and their passion for the food they serve is evident in everything they do.  Bravo! Brava!"}
{"text":"Felt like we were seated at their family dinner table. The lamb was really good and the bruschetta was exactly what I was craving."}
{"text":"Went on Friday night.  Been looking for a great restaurant in the area. But this wasn't it. I ordered a ravioli for $16.95. It was better than some in the area but not what I expect for that price. Everything looked ala carte so for only 7 raviolis ( no salad or anything). $17 is high.  I left hungry. Shared a tiramisu which was excellent and worth the $7.95.  Both my friend and I were a bit disappointed.  Perhaps if they included some greens on the plate the price wouldn't appear so high. Unlikely to return"}
{"text":"Their pizza is killer! If you like Cibo, you'll love this! Pastas are homemade and it's also the only place in Arizona that I have had a good cannoli. They are going to need to expand to meet the demands of the area."}
{"text":"This place is a rare find in West Valley! Very authentic. It is small so don't expect a huge space. If you want amazing food, and service please visit Fabio On Fire! Not a chain restaurant. The owners will make you feel very special. I had the Spinach Ravioli! Oh my! It was delicious. You will love the food and experience!"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time today, pizza was excellent, best pizza in the area byfar. Would highly recommend, will be back to try the Italian dinner dishes that looked equally as awesome , cannot wait to give them a try, my wife got a cannoli to go, Try this place you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Great food! A very familial atmosphere with great service, too. The restaurant itself isn't the best for big groups- I recommend coming with a friend or maybe someone special for a date night. The food is a bit pricey, but you can literally see it cooked in front of you in the open kitchen. Really great food- I recommend the potato gnocchi."}
{"text":"A slice of Italy in Peoria, AZ. Delicious, reasonably priced entrees. Amazing pastries and killer tiramisu.You arguably won't find better Italian in the Phoenix metro, especially for the price. 

Service is also friendly and fast, and Fabio is a really nice guy.

Congrats to him for opening up such a neat little spot.

A absolute must try for anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Fabio on Fire was our late night treat for our wedding, and everyone LOVED his pizza. Not only was the pizza amazing, but Fabio and his staff were so sweet. Fabio actually gave me and my mom hand written cards to congratulate us, which I thought was such a nice gesture. I feel bad because our guests ate all 40 pizzas we had ordered in less than an hour, and I was kind of rude to Fabio when they said \"no more\" (because I hadn't gotten any yet). We finally decided to just pay for more pizzas...and they were more than happy to make them. Giving me more pizza is the easiest way to make me happy ;-) 

Anyway, just wanted to say thanks so much for making my wedding night so special, Fabio!!! Everyone loved you and your pizza! :-)"}
{"text":"Will be back again and again 
Lobster ravioli is the best! Hand made pastas 
Cook everything in front of you so you know its fresh and  not boxed! Gelato is the best as well!!! Gotta try this place y'all"}
{"text":"This was my first time dining in the restaurant, the service was great, food are very delicious and seems very authentic (I have never been to Italy before)
We ordered lasagna and butternut squash ravioli with prosciutto.

The lasagna was very good, different than the usually kind we have, have more juicy meat pieces than tomato sauce, but it was just enough, and very good, it has less cheese between the layers than we expected, but it was perfect,
Maybe that's how authentic lasagna should be? I don't know. We added some crushed red peppers on top too, which makes it taste even better.
The butternut squash is very creamy, and tasty, it is the perfect combination with some prosciutto pieces.
The portion size is great, it's not too much, and it's not too small, we were attracted by their dessert menu and decided to share a gelato. It was a strawberry flavored gelato. Oh my, that was that best gelato we both have ever tasted. Very fresh and you can taste strawberry in every single spoon.
Would definitely come back!
Great price too! The gelato only cost $2.95 (if I remember correctly)"}
{"text":"We absolutely loved having Fabio on Fire cater our anniversary party. Arranging everything with Jenny was flawless and easy - she was extremely responsive and helpful. The presentation and food at the event itself were perfect - the bruschetta, salads and pizza were so delicious. Everyone loved being able to order exactly what they wanted and we loved having someone else do all the work so we could enjoy ourselves. Fabio is personable and easy to work with. I can't recommend Fabio on Fire highly enough."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here and enjoyed the best meal we have ever had! It is so nice to have a restaurant in the area, that actually serves amazing food! We had Placido Chianti, bruschetta, lasagna, braised short-rib ravioli and tiramisu. We ate and drank EVERYTHING. HIGHLY recommend this place"}
{"text":"First off, food was so delicious. Unbelievably authentic. Italian bread baked in house. Owner is straight off the boat. The service was top notch. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Incredible! So thankful this place is here in Peoria. It is so desperately needed and I love it."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, amazing specials!!' Super authentic, nice to have non chain places to dine on the west side!!"}
{"text":"Quint little place with super great service. Our waiter was knowledgeable along with entertaining. Not fair for me to comment on the pizza,can't say I ever had a true Italian style pizza. For me,I enjoy the good old American Pie. That being said,you need to give them a try to just so you can try a true Italian Pizza."}
{"text":"Just amazing! I had the butternut squash ravioli and it was by far the best pasta I've ever had. The service was wonderful. Truly authentic and delicious!"}
{"text":"This is place is a hidden gem! I had such a happy and wonderful dining experience here. Food was behind my expectation. The lobster and crab ravioli is like magic cure for any moody days. I have never felt so happy after a meal. 
The owner and staff were incredibly friendly and genuinely want the customer to enjoy their food. Definitely will come back again!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  Delicious food, nice atmosphere, and excellent service (Angie is the BEST hostess! and Fabio himself is so friendly).  The handmade pasta is perfect and the recipes are very flavorful.  Tip - the online menu is limited, so be sure to ask about daily specials.  Also, they get busy around 6pm, so either go early, or go to fabioonfire.com and put yourself on the waitlist."}
{"text":"Always a friendly atmosphere and even better food!! We love ordering a bottle of wine and enjoying a nice meal. Don't forget to get a cannoli!"}
{"text":"This is a legit Italian restaurant- I say legit because the owners are from Italy  The food is homemade and very  flavorful. I had the pear salad, short-rib ravioli (not on menu so must request it) and the tiramisu. Everything was delicious. The space is small so be prepared for a wait. The wait staff was so attentive and courteous. Great experience overall!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to casually dine on the West Side. We've ordered for pick up, Door Dashed and dined in early on a Friday evening. Service is slow but the food is great. I love that there are gluten free options for pizza. Best gluten free crust I've ever had. Ever. Bubbles up like a crust should. The produce is fresh and I'm glad Fabio supports local. 

When we dined in, my daughter had the butternut squash ravioli which was to die for. Portions were large enough to share. My husband had the lobster ravioli, which was ok as the portion size left him still hungry. Bread was ok. Food came out promptly after we ordered but we had issues with the hostess. She sat us inside when we asked to be seated outside and never brought us our menus. I saw the hostess bussing tables and touching dirty dishes then passing out water. It was a zoo. I'm sure this happens elsewhere. 

We've had the Diavola pizza and sausage and fungi pizza-both excellent and satisfying. We have also indulged in the cookies which were pretty good. The strawberry gelato was refreshing and delicious. 

Quality of food makes up for the hospitality that still needs to be ironed out."}
{"text":"We love Fiorella! The bruschetta was good but only two pieces of bread. Expensive! We ordered the butternut squash raviolis. They were excellent except $17 for 5 raviolis is a major rip off! Not sure we will return."}
{"text":"Super disappointed in this restaurant, especially with all the great reviews I read prior to making plans here for my mother's birthday. Went on a Saturday night with a party of 6 plus 2 kids and thank goodness we made a reservation. The place is cramped and you are constantly being bumped into by other guests or servers. Our waiter was great and attentive but I didn't like that we were only told the amount our bill was so he could run my card on an iPad and not given an opportunity to actually look at the bill. Sometimes accidents happen and I like to ensure my bill is only what I ordered but I was not able to do that. For our party we paid $150 without tip which is crazy expensive for what we got. 
2 of us had the eggplant parm and were both disappointed. It was bland and boring, and I'm missing the \"parm\" aspect as it has no breading and no cheese. Also for the price, it didn't come with a side of pasta or anything so we simply had a plate of eggplant and sauce. 
Another person had a pear salad with lemon vinaigrette dressing that was no more than olive oil on arugula. Also bland and boring. 
Another person had the lasagna. Large portion, great tasting homemade noodles but so little sauce it was dry. 
The short rib ravioli had meat tasted well done but the cheese sauce was tasty. 
One person had the spinach ravioli with a walnut cream sauce and absolutely loved it. The cheese sauce was flavorful and not overwhelmingly heavy. 
To end dinner, the tiramisu was outstanding. It'd prob be the only thing worth returning for."}
{"text":"Tried this spot in a recommendation from some true Italian friends that love to cook great Italian food. They were so impressed, we had to try for ourselves.  We started out with a beautiful spinach salad & baratta with prosciutto.  Both were excellent.  Moved on to homemade ravioli with fresh broccoli @ sausage.  Finished with a lovely tiramisu...so wonderful.  We will be back..."}
{"text":"Exactly what Peoria has been missing! This is legit up and down.  Amazing, delicious and authentic Italian. Everything on the menu is sooo good!  Takes me back to Italy. Definitely give it a go!  You won't regret."}
{"text":"Am I missing something? What is so great about this place? They don't take reservations, the restaurant is poorly arranged and incredibly cramped (servers tripping over each other, tables mere inches apart, noise level is basically a roaring din --- it felt like eating at an Arbys at a Bus Station in Newark). 

The food was nothing spectacular either - the burrata  appetizer was very basic, and you can get better at Fry's Marketplace up the road. The rotating special Tortelli was good, but the four cheese Gnocchi was incredibly gummy and I honestly hate to say this, but, the sauce totally smelled like my dog's food. Wildly unappealing.

I will say our server was genuine and nice, though he forgot to ask me for a refill of wine. The credit card app didn't work and the server had to go stand by the window to get a signal - it's 2017, how is that a thing? 

This place gets an insane amount of positive buzz on Facebook and on Nextdoor. I think people are just excited for a restaurant in the area that's not McDonalds."}
{"text":"This restaurant sits in a really unassuming strip mall in Peoria. Please don't let that fool you. This restaurant could compete with some of the best neighborhood Italian restaurants in the country.  I went with a couple of friends and we got a few things to share. 

The pasta is freshly made ... and you can tell. Excellent quality. We also got a couple of appetizers.  The tomato with burrata was amazing. Also, had the meatballs in a marinara sauce. It too was really good. 

We shared a pizza too which had such quality ingredients and a fantastic taste. 

The meal was finished with a canoli.  

I'm from Chicago. My mother is Sicilian.  I feel confident that I know great Italian food and this is it.

Nothing pretentious,  very casual and neighborhoody.  Fabio himself is making pizzas and greeting customers with his broad grin and wonderfully inviting Italian accent. 

This is what dining out should be. Quality, fresh, reasonably priced and so welcoming."}
{"text":"The fresh pear salad, the scrumptious pizza, and the service were all top notch.  A warm and welcoming feeling eating a Sunday evening dinner at an Italian family-owned place.  The owner came by to say hi and ask about the meal, nice touch.  This quaint place is a throwback to the way restaurants used to be.  This is a classic Italian eatery with a modern menu and facilities.  We were too full after our meal to try the fresh pastries but they looked delicious.  We will return and save room for dessert next time."}
{"text":"First time going here, saw it in the AZ Republic! It's been open for 2 months and already packed! 10/10 would recommend. Very small place but the servers were all so nice and helpful as well as attentive. The food was so delicious. Bread given as a starter was so good and sliced meats and cheeses were very fresh. Pizza was very nice and good size for 2 people. Lobster ravioli was a weekend special. Desserts were presented in a glass case all prepared that same day! Cannoli's and Diplomatic Cake were extremely authentic. One of the best and most authentic Italian restaurants I've been to!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Finally excellent dining in the west side of Phoenix. Fresh fresh fresh and all homemade. The smell of the baking bread when you walk in tells all. Atmosphere is warm, friendly and pure Italian. I cannot stress enough how wonderful this restaurant is."}
{"text":"The food was so yummy! I came with a group of ladies eating on the covered patio. I had the butternut squash ravioli and chocolate gelato with meringue cookie. The pasta was great for summer! The chocolate gelato is very rich and chocolatey. The meringue cookie was light and crispy. I would definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"The service and food was incredible. It was surprisingly busy for a Thursday night but it made for great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"It would seem like an exaggeration if I said this is the best Italian food I've ever had. Fabio on Fire is no joke. Best Italian food I've ever had. We we're lucky enough to be seated at the bar and the owner served us freshly baked bread.  I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"So excited we found this place!! We've been so impressed with the food and service we've gone twice in one week. Raffaello was server both times and we were so happy! He's fun and so passionate about the food and our experience. Also their cannolis are the best I've ever had, and I would call myself a cannoli connoisseur!"}
{"text":"This place's pizza is just as good or better (in my opinion) as/than Pomo's, Piazza Al Forno, and Pizzeria Bianco's. The little space it is in is not pretentious but a nice local spot. Everyone was very friendly inside (I got a to-go order so I wouldn't have to wait over an hour) and got my food on time. Was quoted 15-20 mins. Also ordered the pesto gnocchi which was not a disappointment. The portions look small but are actually very filling."}
{"text":"The worst dining experience I've had in years.  The food is fair, but the service is awful. We're not going back."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the quality of the food and service.  Most of the staff are from Italy and truely infuse a piece of Italy into each dish.  We ordered a large pear salid, gluten free pizza, and eggplant parmesan and ate family style.  It was so delicious!  We finished it off with thier in house Tiramisu and an Italian cappuccino which was spot on!  In the end we bought a variety of Biscotti, and cookies for later.  They are in the process of applying for a liquor license, so until then you'll have to drink water, tea, or an Italian soda."}
{"text":"Wow the west side finally has a reason to go out for a meal. Love the authenticity and feeling of this restaurant. Very friendly when you walk in, everything is in the open like a true Italian kitchen.  Authentic Italian dishes, pizza, deserts, and beers! Can't wait to have a sit down dinner experience!! Today grabbed a cannoli, pizza, and Birra Moretti = perfecto!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner last night and it's truly the best Italian we've had in Arizona. Italian is my favorite food therefore I'm very picky too. The hostess, waitstaff, owner and every other employee there were VERY nice, attentive and truly made you feel welcome.  You feel like your have dinner at your Italian uncles house!"}
{"text":"Best Italian food I've had since being back from Italy! Good pricing and very friendly staff.  Loved the fresh produce and pizza! I will be making this my go to pizza joint! Thank you Fabio On Fire!!"}
{"text":"This is our second review of Fabio's--and our fifth or sixth lunch and/or dinner. Today, for lunch, we had the bruschetta with FRESH buffalo cheese plus an artisan pizza with Italian salami and caramelized onions. As always, a wonderful combination of flavors and textures. Fabio's is our favorite restaurant -- great staff and Fabio knows how to treat customers.

Update 10/20: Today we had the salami and caramelized onion pizza again PLUS the antipasto with hot and mild Italian salami, mortadella, cheeses including mascarpone cheese with walnuts, olives, and more. Yum!"}
{"text":"So, the name got my attention, the menu got my interest, and the food got my vote. 

OMG this place is amazing.  Coming from an Italian family from NYC, i am a bit skeptical of Italian dining.  Wow were we pleasantly surprised.  One of the best places I know, and thier deserts may be even better than the main course.  The strawberry gelato was enough to come back for on its own.

Now to the service.  Nothing short of perfect. They work together as a team and my table was never in want for anything."}
{"text":"Summary: Great Italian food, very friendly staff. Go here and eat. Not many tables, so go early.

Referred: By a friend.

Waiter: Raphael. Treated us like family. Seemed genuinely glad that we were there, eating at (his?) restaurant. Super neat guy.

Wait: We were seated immediately and were served some bread while we waited. They promptly took or order, which took a little while to be prepared. However, the food was made to order, and we were not disappointed by the wait. (This is NOT Olive Garden speed.)

While we waited: Delicious handmade bread w/ oil and vinegar. We ate a bunch of this stuff, then bought a loaf to eat at home. They were not stingy with the bread, which was nice.

- - -

Dishes:

Butternut Squash Ravioli. Me. Rich, handmade pasta, creamy sauce. Not a giant portion, but very rich and delicious... the squash was sweet against the cheesy cream sauce. (You probably wouldn't want a giant bowl of this.) I'd eat this again.

Margarita Pizza. 15 year old son. Great crust, handmade sauce. Good stuff. Son enjoyed it. (I stole a piece.)

Bolognese. Wife. Tasty as well. Rich meat sauce. Nicely made pasta. Me and my wife shared this and my Ravioli, which paired together nicely. (I'd share like this again.)

- - -

Overall, we felt like family, had a great meal, and would go back here again. You should too, but get there early as it's not a large place.

Glad to have a place like this in Peoria."}
{"text":"Wife and I went here due to the yelp reviews. She had the squash ravioli and I just wanted pizza. Food was great employees are GREAT!  Kinda small area but we'll worth the strawberry gelato at the end! Will be back.. now off to a movie!"}
{"text":"The owners, servers and hosts are very friendly.  You'll often see them walk around and say \"ciao\" hello and ask if everything is ok.  The place is quaint and has a brick oven.  To start we ordered the pear salad to share. 
Also ordered the butternut squash ravioli and Salciccia e Funghi pizza.  It was so good!  I really wanted to make room for dessert but I was stuffed!  Definitely returning to this gem."}
{"text":"This is a really cute place for lunch or dinner. We went for lunch with a big group of 10 and they could accommodate us and everyone was really friendly. I recommend the butternut squash ravioli but i hear the eggplant Parmesan is pretty good. I ordered a couple cookies to go and they were all really tasty. The almond cookie with Nutella was my favorite. Good for big groups but you may need to plan ahead. Parking is easy and the place is easy to find."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my evening at Fabio On Fire. Everything is homemade right on the premises. I ordered the lasagna. A little different than my wife's. Multiple layers of pasta smothered in a meat sauce. The bread is terrific. And my little waitress was a charm. Fabio and Jennifer do a great job. Only recommendation:  The wine pour was pretty marginal... in a small glass barely half way to the \"shoulder\".  Not an inexpensive restaurant but the food is very good. Small too. 35p inside,  25p outside.  Cozy!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. We've been there twice now and both times have been beyond our expectations. The serving staff and the owner both take extreme pride in the business and their product. The owner is personally involved with his customers. The quality of their food is top notch. They make their own bread daily as well as homemade mozzarella and pasta.
I went in today with my daughter and Rafael was our server again. We had been in about two weeks ago and he remembered us and greeted us like old friends. We ordered the Caprese salad, and the homemade mozzarella was some of the best I've had since our visit to Rome a few years ago. The pizza dough is indescribable and the homemade bread rivals some of the best bakeries I've ever been to. If you haven't been to this restaurant you are missing out. We live over 40 miles away and we plan on being regulars. It's totally worth the drive."}
{"text":"This is a very cute place that has a nice outdoor patio. They only serve beer and wine, so don't ask for a cocktail. I was looking for a pizza that wasn't on the menu. Our waiter said I could build my own pizza, but quickly told me Fabio gets upset with menu changes when I tried to order. All I wanted on my pizza was olive oil, fresh mozz, and tomatoes. I had to order a 4 cheese pizza because that was the closest they could get with what was on the menu. I was happy to pay for the 4 cheese minus the 3 cheeses, but I was told it wasn't an option. 
Service was good even though they were busy. The food was hit and miss. Appetizer and lamb entree were great, but the pizza was just ok. The sauce and 4 cheeses made it a bit soggy. The outer crust was still crispy and had great flavor. I ended up only eating the crust. 
I would go back, but probably only for appetizers. I'm sure people anybody that loves a loaded pizza will enjoy this spot."}
{"text":"We found this place on a recommendation.  I am so glad we came!  The food is amazing!! We had the margherita pizza, a pear salad, an original cannoli, strawberry cake and a dozen cookies to go!! Everything is AMAZING!! Great flavor, fresh!  The price is suitable."}
{"text":"Ciao,
This is the \"Hidden Gem\", in the NW Valley. I have been to Italy twice in my life and this place has the aroma of \"Italia\".
Fabio, is very much on fire, with his homemade dough, buffalo mozzarella, sausage, all with the ingredients from his homeland. The wine list is of simple value and exceptional, exactly what you would find in Italy. 
Pizza here is eaten with a fork and knife just like you would find in Sorrento or ol' Napoli!
Dinners are excellent with great flavor and some home made pasta dishes. 
Once you are done with your meal, then the next delight are the desserts! Again, all homemade recipes. Cannoli, tiramisu and Italian cookies line this awesome bakery case.
Even though you will get a great meal, it is a bonus to walk into a place with an exceptional staff. They treat you like a guest and you feel every bit one, even through their busiest hours!
I am sure once you go, it will become a tradition for years to come.
Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"This little Italian restaurant is the real deal folks. I almost don't want to talk about it because it'll get more crowded than it already is but I can't keep it a secret because that would be unfair.

The Capriocciosa pizza was amazing. It had San Marzano tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, artichoke hearts, prosciutto, olives, basil, and EVOO (extra virgin olive oil). It's funny because I'm not a huge fan of artichoke anything unless it's in a dip and not the biggest fan of olives BUT I loved this pizza. The artichoke hearts were soft and velvety and so easy to eat. The olives were a perfect slightly salty type of delicious. I actually looked for them and ate them when they fell off my slices. 

Next time I think I'll try the Tarantina which had the same first two ingredients but then had spicy salami, Gorgonzola, and white caramelized onions. I would've tried all 11 of them last night but couldn't fit it all in! 

The veal meatball appetizer was so flavorful and served with freshly baked bread. They had fresh rosemary in a pot on the table so you can pick off the rosemary and sprinkle some in olive oil on your appetizer plate and salt it. 

The ravioli is hand made daily every morning. Wait, I'm wrong. Every pasta dish is made this way. They sold out of the butternut squash ravioli so we had to settle for the veal and beef ravioli. Poor us, right? It was unbelievable. They also had a lobster ravioli available but my friend and guitar teacher, Pat, who had recommended the veal in such high regards. He is one of the most Italian people I know so we had to go with veal. Pat also recommends the eggplant entrée but again, we'd have to try that next time.

Our waitress Fiorella was one of the sweetest, warmest people I've ever met. She was personable and made us laugh and when she spoke in Italian with other staff members, it really did feel like I was invited to a family dinner in Italy. When I was eating that amazing looking and tasting pistachio cannoli, she said, \"I'm not going to tell you how to eat it, but you should just use your hands,\" and gave us no forks for the cannoli. She is the best! 

They have a smorgasbord of Italian pastries. You can get a box and just pick and choose an assortment of what you like. Everyone seemed to after they finished their dinners. We were the only ones that didn't since we just ate that huge cannoli.

Like any awesome restaurant, it's busiest on weekends and the service may be a bit slower. During the week, like on a Tuesday, it's just perfect our waitress said. It's not super fancy or anything but you definitely feel like you're getting a fabulous home cooked authentic Italian meal and experience when you come here. You'd think the pizzas would be the stand out but the pasta may be the real standout. You decide!!"}
{"text":"Wow I don't even know where to begin. First of all my wife was really excited to try this place as she has seen ton of recommendations on next door for how great it was . I was open since our family was really hoping for a go to place near our house.

Here are my thoughts; the service was Terrible, took 15 minutes to get a glass of water, another seven minutes to order, The menu was really confusing and we felt like the pizza at char was 100x better. Not to me mention the POS system is an iPad.

I get that they have only been open for 7 weeks however I would be shocked if they made 7 months"}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, I expected great things. The food was very good. Compared to the competition you won't be disappointed. Great value. Fantastic desserts! I got the diplomat (Italian for a Napoleon, basically.) Get that if you go. 

A four star review for three things:

1. Poor wine list, three choices of red.
2. Uncomfortable, cramped tables very close together. Loud, no sound damping. Bad light, reminded me of lights you'd see in a Mc Donald's. They could do a lot of romancing the place for not very much money.
3. We got a pizza to split for two of us. The center of the crust was soggy. 

Those three points aside, I really enjoyed myself. I will go back. Maybe during the day, and sit on the patio.  This is just not the place to go if you want ambiance.  Prices are very fair, and food quality is excellent (save the soggy pizza crust)."}
{"text":"Small but INCREDIBLE food and personable service. Thank goodness for a great high quality restaurant in our area. Butternut squash pasta is a MUST as well as cannoli and espresso."}
{"text":"Real Italian food in a small strip mall restaurant! We had the meatballs and a pizza. Homemade meatballs that literally melted in my mouth. It was crazy good. The pizza crust was perfect! I will pick different toppings next time as the artichokes didn't provide the flavor we thought it would. Friendly staff and very attentive! We found a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Omg what an amazing little gem on the north-west side!  Went with my family after hearing it was a great place from a client.  We got a table on time despite it being pretty busy for a Sunday. Our server came and introduced himself and told us about the restaurant. They have homemade pasta and fresh baked bread and wildfires pizza. 

We ordered a burrata and pear salad to start with. The burrata came with roasted Campari tomatoes and pesto. I would have like the tomatoes to have a bit more flavor but the mozzarella was super fresh and with the delicious bread it was a win.  The pear salad was perfect with the spice from the arugula and the sweetness of in season pear.  The toasted shaved almonds were a nice surprise as well. It was dressed perfectly too. Not soggy at al and not too dry.  

For my entree I ordered the salciccio and funghi pizza. OMG it was perfection!!!! The sauce was perfectly seasoned. The mushrooms were fresh and the sausage wasn't too overpowering. It was the perfect Neapolitan style pizza. Bubbly, crispy, and chewy at the crust with some char and saucy and thin in the center. The rest of the family all got pastas and everyone's came seasoned perfectly and the pasta was the perfect texture with a nice amount of sauce on top.

We finished with a box of assorted homemade Italian cookies and oh my word they were delicious. 

I will definitely be back and would highly recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Just amazing authentic Italian food. Big portions, reasonable prices. Homemade bread, pasta and desserts. This place is the best!!!"}
{"text":"First and last time for this restaurant. Very small, I felt I was in a tin can. Owner and his wife went on chatting with customers for excessive amount of time while my wife and I waited patiently for service. Other employees looked at us like we weren't even there. People stood around ignoring us. After much patience we got up and walked out. Several employees looked at us but nobody asked if anything was wrong or thanked us for our business.

DONE!!!!!!!!! Couldn't even comment on the quality of the food, because we never had a chance to try it."}
{"text":"Beyond amazing!!!!!!! The service, food and atmosphere was outstanding. Try this amazing Italian food restaurant!"}
{"text":"We just had the best Italian food we have ever had!!! You leave talking about when you are coming back! Service was excellent and you get to watch your food being made from scratch in the open kitchen! It was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Today, 9 of my friends and I had lunch at Fabio's fabulous restaurant! Most people who know me, know that I am a big supporter of locally owned restaurants, so when I heard about Fabio opening a restaurant in Peoria, I knew we had to try it!
It was fabulous! First, the bread is the best I have eaten. Fresh with a crunchy crust that had a good chew to it, as well. The inside, soft, yet substantial. I am pretty sure I ate half a loaf.
I ordered the Tagliatelle with Bolognese sauce. Excellent! Homemade pasta and sauce. I didn't order a salad, but the ones that people ordered looked delicious and were very generous in size.  The pizzas are wood fired in the oven, which is the prominent feature of the restaurant interior. Everyone raved about their pizzas.
After the meal we had gelato and several of the desserts to pass around. The gelato is house made and so creamy and good. The different pastries sampled, were outstanding. 
I plan to make this one of my regular places to dine. The inside is well appointed and it is perfect for a date night or lunch/dinner with friends."}
{"text":"This is one of the finest Italian restaurants in Phoenix.  Small crowded with great friendly waitpersons who really know the menu and the specials.  Food is like home my wife's pizza was excellent and my pasta with meat sauce was great.  We will return on a regular basis.  


Another great meal and the most friendly place in town"}
{"text":"Loved it! We were able to make a reservation for a group of 9
 of us. The initial service of drinks and taking food orders was very prompt, however getting our food was a slow. Not extreme though, and it was worth the wait. Their pizza menu is more extensive than their pasta menu, with only 4 or 5 pasta dishes listed, but everything we had was delicious, from the strawberry salad, Bianca Parma pizza (white pizza), lasagna and butternut ravioli, to the cannoli. My only suggestion would that they serve some olive oil & balsamic vinegar for dipping with the delicious bread they put on the table when you're seated."}
{"text":"Do you love Italian food?  I have not had Italian food as good as this since I left New York.  The bread is to die for, the cannolis are exquisite and all of his pastas and pizzas are fantastic."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this 5 stars. So let's get the drawback out of the way. We had one of the pizzas and except for the outer crust, the center crust was unable to hold up to the toppings. 

But what I could could rave about is everything else. Family owned and run and pride of place is evident in the friendly service of our waiter to the owner checking in with each table to the thoroughness in the wiping of the tables. Having been to Italy, this is THE most authentic experience of a restaurant in Italy that I have experienced in the U.S. 

Wine and beer choices are limited which is fine. The flavors of our pizza were far better than expected. We had the Tarantina pizza which was a bit out of our comfort zone for our usual pizza topping choices and the flavors just blended and popped. We were looking for a dinner in the shared pizza price range and were most pleased. Next time we return, my BFF says he will opt for lasagna and I know I shall opt for one of the ravioli specials which are constantly rotating. 

We seldom eat dessert, but with the display of cookies, tiramisu and Napoleons along with what our waiter related was the gelato of the day, we had to share a cannoli. Since the best cannoli I've had are found in New York City, I was transported back to Little Italy with the fire bite. 

Did I mention the whole restaurant applauding and smiling when a  woman celebrating her birthday was sung Happy Birthday in Italian?

My daughter spent a year in Milan and the first thing I did when we left was text her to say this was a must for an authentic experience."}
{"text":"Small place with big hearts! Love the friendly staff, made you feel right at home! The food was delicious !!!"}
{"text":"Thank you Fabio and Jared for setting up your food truck / pizza oven in our 'hood last night...

Your pizzas were delicious and provided the perfect fuel for both the kids and adults to trick-or-treat for hours!

We thought your prices were moderate at $8 - $9 per pizza... we shared a Margherita, an American, and one with spicy sausage that isn't listed on the website.  I'm bummed I didn't take pictures!

I hear that Fabio also makes appearances at Old Town and Ahwatukee Farmers Markets on occasion and in addition to pizza, they sell fresh bread, cookies and pastries... if those things are made with as much passion as the pizza, then they are definitely worth a shot.

Chef Fabio is available for hire for special events and will bring his mobile wood-fired oven to you (as he did for our Halloween block party last night).  If you hire him, please send me an invitation to join ;)"}
{"text":"This is a super solid spot in the west Valley. I had the privilege of trying his pizza when he catered an event I was at and was really excited to see that he had opened a restaurant. Their bolognese and homemade accompanying pasta is top notch. The meatballs are second to none. They had about a bazillion different types of filled raviolis and will definitely try one of those next time. It's a small spot and I hope he has lots of success. The prices are incredibly reasonable (a shared app, a shared salad, two entrees, a scoop of homemade gelato, a dozen Italian cookies to go AND a bottle of wine came in at $100 before tip). Go!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. The real deal. If you want Italian. Delicious cookies you can take to go as well. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Ordered several to go meals as well as anti pasta and two different  salads. The gnocchi was the BEST as was the lasagne. Grandma liked her bolganese pasta.  The Bread and the dessert were like heaven!!  WOW just WOW"}
{"text":"Omg !! An Italian Jewel in lake pleasant rd ! Our server Rafael was just incredible , he was just amazing describing the food and the Italian wine - we will be back !!also The owner is working the main kitchen :) kitchen that I am super surprised is very very small - but the food taste is just YUMMY !!! We will be back soon and we will make this place our weekly restaurant - prices are reasonable . For the people that know Italian food - This is the place to go . You will have an incredible experience coming here."}
{"text":"Food is simply delicious!! Everything is made fresh. The cookies OH MY GOSH they just melt in your mouth. Friendly staff & I love the fact that it is family owned. I will be back & definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great place for dinner. The owners treat you like family. We stopped in late & after walking up to the door noticed that they were about to close. We turned to walk away & the owners came out & invited us in anyway. So nice!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! So happy to have a delicious non chain restaurant on the west side.  What a treat!  

We started off with the Burrata - Campari tomatoes+burrata+pesto+extra virgin olive oil.  So so fresh!  Excellent home made bread. 

Entre: Gnocchi, Salciccia E. Funghi and Lasagna.  All pastas are home made. 

Desserts: Cannoli and Italian Cookies


Be sure to take time to chat with Fabio and hear his story.  

Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely amazing! We tried ravioli, a different type of pasta, pizza, and a seafood appetizer. Everything was so delicious! The service was amazing and the environment and vibe makes it feel as though you are in Italy! We will definitely be coming here at least once a month. The desserts are also delicious!"}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant and it was semi busy. Waited forever to talk to someone about a table. Was told over an hour wait. They had tables open and no one sitting in them. This place is small and little pricey for what it is. They lack customer service skills. I would say it's trying to be upscale in a small location and are out of their league."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness - Italian good to die for.  Recipes from grandma for sure.   The owner is engaged and follows up with tables.   The servers are personable and quick to get you anything you need.   Very cozy feel.  The food was outstanding.   They had nine specials not on the menu.   Their gelato was unforgettable - dark chocolate."}
{"text":"Outstanding new original Italian restaurant with true Italian dishes that are old family recipes. Great selections, great attentive servers and outstanding deserts. Brick pizza oven, great pizza. Highly recommend. The restaurant is small and the waits can be long but the food is worth the wait. Fabio the owner is always on site and speaks to all the customers. Thank you for coming to Peoria."}
{"text":"What a great find!! We are visiting from Kansas City and really enjoyed our sausage and broccoli ravioli. Ended with 1 cannoli and then added another so good! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Went for the first time and was so happy to find this gem. Husband and wife owned and operated and food was fantastic. Going back two days in a row in fact. So good."}
{"text":"Had gnocchi with pesto, lobster ravioli (special), Roasted rack of lamb with potatoes, and the Diavolo pizza.  I wasnt a huge fan of anything but the pizza and our server is the reason Im giving this place 4 stars. Rafael was the greatest server I might have had in the history of eating out. He made everything sound fantastic!!  
The sauce on the lobster ravioli was very fishy. I couldnt eat more than a small bite. The pesto on the gnocchi was a tad bland.  The lamb was ok, but im not a huge fan of lamb so I shouldnt really critique it. I did enjoy the pizza with spicy salami.  I would DEFINTELY go back though and try different things on the menu as Rafael made the dining experience simply amazing. Felt like being at home with my Italian family. I even told the owner he needs a raise.  The prices were VERY reasonable but the portions are not very large. We were a party of 3 and ordered 3 entrees and one pizza and split everything. Overall, it was a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Excellent service,  really good food.  

We went for dinner the other night and we were greeted with hugs and kisses.  Well, I wasn't but the two who brought us here for dinner were.  My boyfriend's sister and brother-in-law have known the owner and head waiter for a long time and have followed them from one resturant to this one. 

The service was amazing.  The wait for food was a bit too long and i could tell others near us were getting a little impatient with their wait as well.  However, the owner came out and went from table to table and made quick friends.  He knows customer service for sure. 

The portion sizes seemed a bit off to me.  I had a very large portion size of spaghetti while my boyfriend, who ordered the entree of ravioli, got a much smaller portion. The tortellini portion size seemed a bit small too.

The resturant size is super small and the wait for a table could take a long time, but in my opinion the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"So much goodness! Excited to find a great, authentic Italian restaurant on our side of town. Everyone was super friendly. We went pretty early on a weekday, so it wasn't too busy. The waitress took my son over to watch Fabio make and then bake his pizza. He absolutely LOVED this, and the pizza was fantastic (my picky 8 year old ate his entire kid's pizza, then 3 slices of my sausage & mushroom). It's a pretty small place, with an indoor capacity of ~40. The pasta dishes I saw delivered to nearby tables smelled amazing, and the homemade gelato was delicious. Can't wait to try more items from the menu."}
{"text":"First time here. Had the capricciosa pizza. Delicious! A little skimpy on the toppings but still memorable. Didn't care for the waiter. Very pushy and made you feel bad for only wanting pizza and not wine, appetizer or desert."}
{"text":"We keep enjoying this neighborhood gem! Fabio and his team are the friendliest people, make you feel like family from the moment you arrive at this darling restaurant/pizzeria. The food match the welcoming atmosphere ! Love the pizza, we always get at least one, the fresh mozzarella is divine, bread amazing! Every entree we've tried has been so delicious, maybe the ravioli is our favorite? The best tiramisu ever and they give little cookies to our grandchildren. Just ate there last night and can't wait to go back next week. Never disappoints! Fabio has an amazing story, if you can get him to stop working so hard. Love him, his mom and the whole staff. Thanks for another great evening at your restaurant! Grazie!"}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever don't waste your time or money here
First time eating his pizza and the dough wasn't cooked and the cooks answer was it's Italian pizza so it is meant to waste like that"}
{"text":"I am not quite sure where to start! We used Fabio for my sister's bridal shower and from beginning to end--it was just FABULOUS! Jenny was so easy to work with and made getting everything arranged so easy.  The day of the shower, Fabio was such a joy to work with.  Everyone at the party loved him and LOVED the food he made.  We had bruschetta (on amazing fresh bread) and Caesar salad to start and then moved on to some of the best tasting pizzas you can get.  Everything was made to order for all of the guests--fresh ingredients, cooked to perfection, and fast as well!  They were so organized and there was never any long waits.  It was a great flow and great service.  Having Fabio was such a great addition to the shower.  The wood fire oven is beautiful and really added such a neat element to our theme.  I will certainly be using Fabio again and would highly recommend him and his team to anyone!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try something new and this place popped up on yelp. I placed a to-go order.I ordered 4 lasagnas and two pizzas. This came out to almost $90 dollars. One would think that you would have some sort of side or some bread to go with the order. Nope! There were small portions in comically large containers. Both pizzas had little toppings. The sauce for the lasagna was over salted and almost inedible .This place is way over priced for what you get."}
{"text":"We went there a couple of weeks ago & we haven't been able to forget the delicious real Italian food. The bread is gift worthy!! The staff is very friendly & we appreciate being welcomed in to a restaurant. ( some places forget \" there are many restaurants to go go.\") These people make you feel like family without over doing it."}
{"text":"The food is great, but the menu is very limited. It's a very authentic little neighborhood place.. if you want to have dinner on the weekend, get there early, I don't think it holds 10 tables and it's very popular."}
{"text":"Fabio On Fire has the most delicious Italian food around.  The food is fresh and homemade and they always offer nightly specials.  Just wait until you try their bread, you will want to buy some to bring home.  Besides the food being delicious the staff is always so kind.  If you are trying to find somewhere to eat dinner once you eat here you will be hooked!"}
{"text":"There's no denying the Italian legitimacy of Fabio on Fire. And in an area like Peoria, which is largely considered a culinary joke in comparison to Central Phoenix or Scottsdale, it's definitely a welcoming addition. I've dined at Fabio's on multiple occasions since they first opened, including their very first week of operation. I've watched their popularity rapidly grow to the point where I often question if this particular location is the best choice for what it is they're trying to accomplish.

I'll be honest here. On a good night, Fabio's pizza and pasta are easily comparable to some of the better Italian restaurants you can find in Phoenix. Their butternut squash ravioli, for example, is spectacular when done properly, putting most restaurant's take on the dish to complete shame. On a bad night, however, such as what happened to us recently, the dish was so overwhelming salty that neither myself nor my girlfriend had any desire to finish it.

Their pizzas are stellar and made in that traditional Neapolitan style that I've always preferred. The \"Best outside of Italy\" or \"Best in the U.S.\" Yelp claims are a bit far-fetched and eye-roll inducing, but for this particular area, it's easily one of the better choices you'll be able to find.

For dessert, they have excellent gelato, as well as a variety of Italian pastries and cookies that are on bakery-styled shelves. Nothing is labeled, but Fabio and company will explain everything if you ask. Some cookies I like more than others, but that's just personal preference. They're good when fresh, but suck when stale. I've experienced both.

What I think hurts Fabio's dining experience for customers, despite actually helping the business itself, is that the place was quickly outed to the locals to the point where Fabio's can quickly transform into a complete zoo when the joint gets slammed. The building isn't really set up well for a sit-down restaurant. Tables are all incredibly close together, servers can barely maneuver around, and it's not uncommon to go largely ignored for long periods of time. When moderately full, the coziness and intimacy works fine, but when large parties decide to dine here, it clogs up the restaurant and makes for a bit of a messy experience. Recently, my girlfriend and I checked in and were quoted 45 minutes for a table. The wait almost ended up being triple, yes, triple that time - clocking in at almost 2.5 hours! Granted, the absurdly large party of 20 diners might have had something to do with it, but when your estimates are off by that much, it might be time to rethink things.

Their whole iPad checkout process is very weird. One of the servers comes by and will simply swipe your card when you're ready to leave, without even giving you the opportunity to look at the actual bill. This is not really an ideal setup for a restaurant, as any billing mistakes will inevitably end up going unnoticed. 

My feelings remain mixed. I'm glad that Fabio's is doing well, because their success might help other businesses and chefs realize that West Valley residents are begging for better restaurant options. But the lackluster service on busy nights quickly reveals why I feel that they still have a lot to learn about how to execute on a high level. 

I'll be interested to see how Fabio evolves over time. But for now, I'd still give them a solid recommendation. Just hope that you're there on one of their \"good\" nights and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal here. We started with the Burrata which was very nicely presented. The Burrata was very fresh. She had the Polenta board with sausage in a rustic tomato sauce. I had the short rib ravioli in an Alfredo sauce. I would highly recommend either dish! The service was great and Chef Fabio was even running plates and chatting with each table. The house Red was a Chianti for $28 a bottle. Decent table wine. Went just fine with the food."}
{"text":"I was stunned and blown away on how authentic this Italian restaurant is. The owner and founder named Fabio greeted us at the door behind the bar while making a pizza. The restaurant is very small but has this very warm family vibe. When we chose a place to sit Fabio came over and greeted himself and we shook hands. Everything is home made and only the best ingredients. The smell inside is AH-MAZING! with the wood fired pizza oven! This small family owned Italian Restaurant is a GEM!! I shared the butternut squash ravioli, strawberry salad, and the lasagna. Can't wait to try real authentic pizza next time!"}
{"text":"The best meal I have ever had on the Westside and I have lived here for 12 years! The homemade butternut squash ravioli with prosciutto and a cream sauce was outstanding. So were the cannolis I brought home. They hope to get their liquor license next week. Hurry in, while you can still get a table!"}
{"text":"My husband found this place on Yelp. Amazed we hadn't noticed before, because it's fairly close to home. Anyway, it's really difficult to find a non-corporate restaurant in Peoria, yet here sits this gem! The couple who owns it are from Italy! The recipes are authentic and delicious! I had the butternut squash ravioli. You could tell the noodles were homemade, the sauce was rich and creamy, and the pancetta added a nice savory touch. I want to try other foods there, but I am seriously craving that pasta already! My husband had lobster ravioli, which he said was superb (I don't eat seafood). The kids had a cheese pizza and Kids pasta, and ate every last bite! The bread, pizza dough, and noodles are all house made. They also have a nice dessert menu, which includes Italian cookies!I can't wait to go back! An amazing find in Peoria!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very friendly and everything was home made authentic Italian food. Great wine and the best Cannoli's in town."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined at the bar and had the meatball special for an appetizer and we shared the short rib ravioli special and the capricciosa pizza. The food was amazing and very authentic. The short rib filling was tender and the brown butter sauce was rich and savory. All the staff were very polite and very attentive. It had a very authentic family owned vibe from Italians who love the food they share. I'm very happy that an authentic Italian eatery has come to the west valley and it brings back memories of my grandmother's cooking, we need these types of restaurants in the west valley."}
{"text":"Husband and I were sick of the same ole same ole in the neighborhood, so we stopped here because it's new.
First impression wasn't great. It's a cramped little spot, tables seem like they don't fit right. The teenager that sat us seemed put off by the fact that I didn't want to sit at a tiny table for 2 people (for the record I am a 6' tall female), so we opted for sitting outside. The outdoor patio is nice and it was a lovely evening, so I cooled my jets and felt much less  bitchy. We ordered drinks and were served delicious house made bread with oil and balsamic. Husband ordered a pizza and I ordered the lobster ravioli. 
The pizza needed a few more minutes in the oven, but the sauce and toppings were good. The ravioli had a vodka sauce and were so delicious!
It took a while to get the food, but we were not in a hurry so it was fine. 
We both ordered dessert. Tiramisu and strawberry gelato and both were amazing, but the gelato was the star."}
{"text":"What a cute little place with authentic atmosphere.  We had the sausage ravioli, butternut squash ravioli, one of the specials with pesto shrimp, lasagna and finished it up with the tiramisu.   Everything was excellent!  Small portions, which is good for not having to cart home leftovers. The dessert was very fresh and everything was flavorful.  We want to come back and try a wood fired pizza.  Molto bene!!"}
{"text":"I don't write many ratings and too often I feel that it is the negative ratings that people prefer to write as opposed to when they have had a good experience. I just left my 3rd visit there with my Wife and daughters and every experience is as good or better than the last.  That being said I had to write this rating... Let's start with the fact that I am Italian. Not \"eye-talian\" but italyn or for those from Italy, \"ee-taliano\".  The closer you are to pronouncing it as \"eye-talian\", the less you will understand the culture, the ambiance, the tempo and pace as well as the ingredients of an authentic Italian restaurant like this. I grew up in an Italian restaurant back in Chicago and spent 10 years working in this environment having performed every job in a restaurant form busboy, to cook to Manager and every job in between. Chicago has so many good Italian restaurants you can't throw a stone in any direction without hitting one. I hope that all that introduction says something when I tell you this place is authentic and excellent. I am not going to write about the excellent foods of which there are many and if you don't understand what authentic Neapolitan pizza is supposed to be like (slightly wet) you won't understand this pizza...  but I am going to tell you to come here with enough time, patience and love of food to appreciate what they are doing. Don't be in a rush, don't expect fast food or Olive Garden service... expect authentic people with love for what they do that treat you like family. That ingredients are of the highest quality mostly flown in from Italy.  Their attention to flavors is as realistic to my family experience as it gets. This is a real Italian restaurant with real Italian quality and attention and love of food. Don't rush this experience. If your glass in empty, take a breath, catch the waiter or waitress on the next pass through (it is a small place and easy to flag down your waiter) and sit and relax. Don't push this experience, Italians enjoy food as a way to spend time and enjoy friends and family not to wolf down food and get out to the next thing on your list. Once you figure out how to experience an Italian meal \"Italian style\" the quality of your experience will skyrocket as this is the core of the Italian culture.  Thank you Fabio for bringing this unique experience to the West valley."}
{"text":"Fresh pasta, very small place only holds 25. Nice family good service. Every thing is made fresh. We will be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, tried the lobster stuffed ravioli and it was great! We went on a Sunday evening and got right in with a party of 6. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I try to have something different each time. Their pastas are homemade and you can tell.The pizzas are thin crust but the way their cooked makes them taste like deep dish. You must try their desserts! They're fantastic and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This place has great Italian food. The wait staff speak Italian to one another. The eggplant was delicious. The pizza is amazing thin crust and yummy. The buffalo mozzarella appetizer is totally worth it. We bought dozens of cookies and biscotti. You need to try this place!"}
{"text":"A disappointment.  The owner clearly has a vision for what he wants the restaurant to be, but it appears it will take some work to reach that goal.  The food was OK, but nothing special.  The service was horrendous.  We were not informed of the specials, no server checked on us during our meal (I would have liked a second glass of wine or at least to have my water glass refilled; we were interested in ordering dessert).  We waited quite a while before informing Fabio himself that we desired attention.  No explanation, apology or compensation for the inattentive service.  Not a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"We had a fabulous lunch! The Veal Ravioi was delicious and brought to our table by \"Grandma,\" who was so PROUD of her dish- I felt the love she has when she makes it!  The pizza was very good.  Tirimisu was excellent!  Take home some of the cookies.  Best of all, Fabio greets you when you arrive, and talks to every patron at least 3 times and gives a handshake as we left!"}
{"text":"All I can say is 'wow!'. I have had Italian all over the country!  Fabio holds his own against Boston's North End and San Francisco's North Beach. Menu was good but when Raphael, our excellent waiter, told us about the specials for the evening I knew we were in for an outstanding meal.  Short rib ravioli was incredible as was the shrimp pesto dish. I had shrimp and mussels in a red sauce, yum!   Fabio came out to the dining room on several  occasions to check on his guests, how awesome is that! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Having just been in Italy, we were afraid to try the new Italian Restaurant and Pizzeria in the neighborhood. Boy are we glad we did! This place is intimate and the staff is excellent! The bruschetta and pizza were to die for. And the gelato was amazing! We will be back- often!"}
{"text":"Fabio on Fire is AMAZING. I used him to cater my husbands surprise 40th birthday party at my home. Hiring him was a breeze - they were very easy to reach and quick to respond to my questions before I hired them and after. They showed up on time the day of the event, were incredibly courteous and friendly and the pizza was delicious! If you're looking for a fun way to serve delicious, authentically italian pizza, Fabio is your guy."}
{"text":"Overall very good. Limited seating so you have to be patient but everyone is very nice and they clean the tables off fast. We had pizza, bolognese and bruschetta all very good. Prices were good for what you get."}
{"text":"Amazing food, everything from the fresh capresse salad to the Neapolitan dessert! The pizza crust was perfectly wood fired with toppings that made it hard to stop eating. My dad had the lasagna and said it was the best he's ever had! Highly recommend to people who live near and far!"}
{"text":"Flavors were awesome. We ended up having a very good pizza and lobster ravioli. 
Thought the portions were a little light and the service was just ok."}
{"text":"We have been to Fabio's about 7 times since they opened the food is delicious but the portions are extremely small for the amount of money they charge we decided to have pizza this week it was cold limp no crunch to the crust and we asked to have it left in oven extra time to get crust crisp very disappointing they seem very unorganized when busy it's very loud and crowded. Franco worries more about his tip than service he provides.
 Fabio has a gold mined but he needs to make sure it's running perfectly when he is gone."}
{"text":"Wow! Genuine Italian food. Made with love. The butternut squash raviolis were divine. I see that some people complain about the price but you get what you pay for. This is made to order, not reheated food."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. I was a little disappointed that one person in our party got eggplant parmesan and their plate was full and I got ravioli and my portion was kind of small. I would have at least liked some veggies or something to give me a comparable amount of food for dinner. Noice setting, excellent service. Authentic!"}
{"text":"Great place, super friendly, and awesome food! We'll be back over and over!!! Be sure to ask about the specials, they always have a good selection of them. Don't skip the pizza. Don't skip the desert either!"}
{"text":"It was just ok. The bread was good. The tiramisu was good. The sauce didn't do it for me. If I have to add salt and pepper to everything, I'm not going back. I didn't even finish my dinner. Bummer. I wanted to love you!"}
{"text":"Recently got to try this pizza, and it was delicious. Crisp crust, sauce was on point and the cheese pull. Tell you what, ill follow this food truck. If i ever need some catering done, im having these guys do it! Thumbs up, five stars. No less. Thanks for bringing me back to the east coast with a single bite. Dank!"}
{"text":"A cute, intimate restaurant. It is a tight squeeze but it does have outdoor patio seating as well. We had the gnocchi with four cheeses and the special of the night (not on the menu) rack of lamb and potatoes. Tip: ask for the specials! 

The lamb was cooked beautifully, full of juicy flavorful perfection. And the gnocchi was so creamy and savory. 

We also ordered tiramisu and a cannoli. WOW. Amazingly fresh and not over powering with sweetness. Definitely recommend them. 

The hostess and servers were all polite and made it a cozy family atmosphere. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"We peorians are always wanting Scottsdale/Phoenix style quality closer to us - well here it is ... Excellent quality , perfect portions and literally straight outta Italy! Great service from Rafael too - they are clearly excited to be there, excited to have you come and take great pride in their product as they deserve to...it was very hard deciding what to order but at this level I don't think it matters - it was all outstanding...
Yes the yelp hours are off - glad we called since they were open when yelp said they were closed... worked out for us since they weren't busy! But that should be fixed ....Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"WOW, this place is awesome! Cheese and meat trays are so good! Breads and pizzas are just like we had in Italy. Everyone and everything is so amazing here! You must go. They also have a nice patio if you would like to sit outside."}
{"text":"Oh so sorry to write this review. I have heard only good things about this new addition to the westside so my husband and I were truly looking forward to trying it. Just so disappointing........
Since it was a Saturday night I did use the waitlist app located on their website. It worked very well. Restaurant is an extremely small bistro but cute.  We were greeted by a young gal in ripped beans , which I know is fashionable, but not appropriate for a hostess. We were given menus and as we glanced at them I have to admit it was not the easiest to decipher. I adore Italian food and have been in many Italian restaurant in the valley( and I am truly not including the Olive Garden type)... so although I understood most choices on the menu I watched as tables next to us could not figure out what they were to order. Our waiter was very charming but rushed thru choices and since his lovely Italian accent was very thick , understanding our choices was not made any easier. Again, I watched others at the next table looking inquisitively at him also. Anyways, I made the choices of a glass of Chainti, an antipasto, lasagna with bolognese sauce and a wood fired  pizza with prosciutto -we had heard so much about. We sat back to enjoy our dinner and wham......the place got mobbed.  A basket of three slices of cold bread and small serving of olive oil and balsamic was placed on our table. Everyone seemed to be running around and service went down the drain. Our antipasto, which was a charcuterie board of lovely meats and cheeses was placed on our table by a young man who you could tell really did not want to be working. By this time the three small pieces of bread were gone so we had to ask for bread to put our meats and cheeses on. Although it was very appetizing the atmosphere of people being seated, menus trying to be explained, and no place for those waiting to wait, spoiled the appetizer. We were about a third thru this platter when our lasagna and pizza was brought to the table. Very very poor timing. We sent the entrees back so we could finish our appetizer but feeling rushed asked for a box to take the rest of our antipasto home. The young man who did not want to be there gave us a box.....and then he never brought back the entrees. We flagged down the main waiter and he explained since we sent it back it had to be replated. Sorry- not a good answer. Had to flag down waiter for water, never asked if I wanted another glass of wine  but finally our entrees came. Had to ask for parmesan cheese and red pepper. Hostess brought it.  The pizza as fair. We love wood fired pizza but dough had no taste and toppings \" just ok\". The lasagne was different...lasagne pasta with bolognese sauce over the top. Sauce was very bland and homemade pasta was mushy. By this time the noise level was so high and since our table was near the door it was so crowded we could not wait to go. We had been looking forward to a cannoli for desert but actually just wanted to leave. Although Fabio was not there the head chef( I think)  did come over and asked how we liked our dinner. We were honest with him. He thanked us for our comments but that was it. 
Out $70 ......I really wanted to love this place.........will not be back"}
{"text":"If you like long wait, bad service and mediocre food then this the place for you to go."}
{"text":"Such a cute little place and the food is amazing and authentic! So happy to have a place like this in Peoria! Can't get enough!"}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back! This place is the perfect date night , in the neighborhood destination. Everything we had is outstanding & Fabio is absolutely the friendliest, most passionate owner you will meet."}
{"text":"Best pizza in AZ and we've had it all, having hit all those top 10 pizza's in AZ lists - it's hands down the best!

The salciccia e funghi pizza was absolutely out of this world!  We also had the gnocchi with bolognese and bruschetta moderna - all were delicious, fresh and fantastic!  

We will be back!!  So happy to have this on the west side"}
{"text":"I don't know why this restaurant shows as a food truck. They have a nice little restaurant with indoor and patio seating. It was packed but we did the waitlist so we got right in. And it is delicious! We started with the Burrata which is fire roasted tomatoes with fresh made mozzarella cheese ball, pesto and olive oil. The mozzarella cheese was fantastic!! They serve sliced bread with olive oil and red wine vinegar for dipping which was also delicious. I had the Lobster Ravioli and my husband had the Seafood Pasta Special which included shrimp and muscles. The pasta is made fresh daily and not can you tell!! Everything was so good. They do waitlist seating on the website and I recommend it. It's a small place but the food is ready quickly. Our server Rachel was awesome and we really enjoyed chatting with her. We brought home homemade cannolis and I can't wait to have them!! Great food and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"My new favorite place. If you are looking for a place that feels like walking in to an Italian family home, this is it. Not only is the food amazing, but the people really make you feel like family. I ordered gnocchi and my husband had ravioli. Oh, and the desserts... oh man. We had tiramisu and hazelnut Gelato. Absolutely perfect."}
{"text":"Our friends recently came here and raved about the food being cooked from scratch, and because of that it was delicious. We just left after our first experience and all I can say is-it was amazing. We are so happy to have a family owned business of this quality so close to our home. Once you walk in the entire staff, including Fabio, make you feel like family and want to feed you like family. You can tell there is great pride in the family history in the business and they don't want to let anyone down. Great food & great people- we will be back."}
{"text":"At last there is a quality restaurant in the neighborhood! This small, authentic Italian has homemade pasta and sauces. They use quality ingredients to deliver delicious classic dishes (lasagne, bolonaise, tagliatelle) as well as some innovative pairings (butternut squash ravioli with sage cream- yummy!!). Service was good. Nice wine list too."}
{"text":"We went for a late lunch on a Sunday afternoon,after a movie. We wanted to try several things, so we decided to share dishes. Started off with homemade Italian bread from the woodfire oven. Then we had the Caprese. The fresh mozzarella was so delicious, as was the balsamic glaze. More bread was delivered-tried it dipped in the balsamic and it was taken to a new level! Next we shared the handmade Gnocchi with four cheese sauce. Words can't explain this dish- amazing. And we also tried their meatballs in marinara sauce- the best meatballs I've ever had. Barely enough room left for dessert, so we shared the original cannoli, which was filled with a refreshingly light and fluffy filling with just the right amount of chocolate chips. We loved our first experience here and we will be back! Thank you, Fabio for bringing in a nice original restaurant into our Peoria neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Real authentic and delicious Italian food! Everyone that works there is so friendly and personable. They  really go above and beyond to make sure you have a great dining experience. So happy we FINALLY have a good Italian restaurant on the west side!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Great pizza, friendly staff and Fabio even came to speak us since it was our first time! Will def be back as this is the best authentic Italian I have had in the west valley. I recommend for everyone to check this place out. Call ahead as the seating is limited and get in the wait list. Trust me, it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Too many negatives.... started off by receiving a dirty knife and a chipped water glass. The same chipped glass was given back later with a tea order. Service was very, very, slow - looked like one waitress for all tables (with a little help from hostess and three bus boys). 

I thought the food was OK though others in my party LOVED their dinner. All five others received their orders about 10 minutes before I did (which was taken off the bill). Prices were good. 

Just not my kind of place, I guess. Decent food but poor service."}
{"text":"Fabio on Fire is a highlight of our trips to Peoria. The food is spectacular, delicious, sophistacted! But as amazing as the food is it is the atmosphere that is the most special. The staff is joyous, attentive, knowledgeable. They remember you when you come back and make you feel like family. Last night was my husband's birthday and the entire waitstaff gathered around our table and launched into a professional quality round of Happy Birthday in Italian and then English. I'm talking the bus boys, the hostess and Fabio himself. So amazing.

This place is special and I can't say enough about it. Try it out."}
{"text":"Fabio and his pizza were amazing!  Such a great idea for late night wedding food - everyone absolutely loved it!  Service was great and he was super appreciative."}
{"text":"A delightful little Italian bistro in the neighborhood. Food is delicious and the atmosphere is cozy. My favorite server is Rafael, he remembered me from when Tutti Santi was open at the citadel!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try a new place. Portions are very small...expensive and not worth it. I ordered butternut squash ravioli.  It was very plain had nothing on top and only came with four. It  looked like tortellini and took and hour and a half to get our food.  I would recommend going  elsewhere."}
{"text":"We got takeout. The food is outstanding. Lasagna and bolognese. We'll return again soon."}
{"text":"It was not a good experience. We were given a large basket for bread and it had 2 small half slices with a huge container of olive oil and wine for dipping. 
When the food came it was awful. The eggplant was mush. It had no flavor. I did not eat my meal.
The owner walked around and never came to our table. 
I would not recommend."}
{"text":"A great dinning experience. Real Italian atmosphere, music and staff. Service was great, food was great. Recommend making reservations, very popular."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food and wood fired thin pizza. Service very attentive. Don't leave without having desert.  Limited space so either call ahead or go early."}
{"text":"Great west valley restaurant!  Excellent wood fired pizza and homemade pasta.  We usually have to go into Phoenix for high quality pizza and pasta but how we have a local neighborhood joint that is really legit!  The staff were super friendly, like eating at your friend's house.  You definitely have to try this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner last night at this little gem.  We were very impressed with the outstanding service and excellent food.  Fabio and all the staff,  assuming they are family,  make you feel like you're eating in their home and are long time friends.  The drink selections were limited as their liquor license is pending.  I had the salciccia e funghi (sausage and mushroom) pizza that was so delish!  My husband had lasagna and said it was the best he's ever had.  I'm not a fan of lasagna but after him saying that,  I had to try it.  He was right,  it was delicious and I will order it next time.  We ordered pistachio and traditional cannolli to go and I ate mine for breakfast!  I'm ready to go back to try the rest of their menu.

I gave them 4 stars only because of the pending liquor license. When I can enjoy a good glass of wine with the excellent food,  I'm sure they won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Very good pizza.  Place was packed but service was great!!!  Definitely recommend and will go back!"}
{"text":"It's been 2 weeks since we ate here. I have thought about our meal every day since. Not only is this place the best Italin restaurant in the West Valley. It is one the best restaurants in Arizona. The food is the real deal. The ragu over parpadella is the best I have ever had. The homemade  ravioli is also the best I have had. It is family owned and operated. The pride and passion shows in everything they do. 
Fabio thank you for doing what you do!!"}
{"text":"What a great experience!!!  Fabulous food, music and service. Been there twice and will continue to return. So nice to have that kind of quality."}
{"text":"I cant say enough good things about this place it is so good such a authentic feel. This tiny place packs a punch"}
{"text":"Just had another fantastic dinner here. Tonight, rack of lamb for me. Lobster ravioli and spaghetti vongole for my friends. Wonderful antipasti board and great wines, by the glass or bottle. Small space, but mighty in terms of value!!"}
{"text":"Best Italian food in the state of ARIZONA....! First time here and will be returning. Fabio is a badass and actually is on fire as a chef! Keep it up."}
{"text":"More than impressed with this little gem. I had the butternut squash ravioli and it was to die for. Perfect serving size. 

Service was beyond wonderful. 

The kind of cooking they presented felt like you were being served a home cooked meal but elevated. 

I loved that the cooks checked on us to make sure we enjoyed our meal and that we were being taken care of. 

The wine was delicious definitely worth getting a bottle of wine and enjoying the moment. 

You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went for dinner two previous times only to find the wait times in excess of one hour. Finally I went myself only and was seated immediately at the counter bar while others still had over a one hour wait. First of all this place is way too small for the demand. Sat at the bar with a direct view of Fabio working the wood burning pizza oven, so I was happy. 

Ordered a garden salad and lasagna. The garden salad was a very basic salad, a bit under dressed but ok. I'd order another one of their salads when I go again. The lasagna was absolutely outsranding. A huge portion, I only ate half and have a lunch today. It had a boulanese sauce which was meaty, rich and very tasty. The cheese and noodles were perfect. Service was very good as well.

I was able to talk with Fabio a bit and he said he's stunned by the flood of customers. West Peoria is a culinary desert so when a good place opens up, they are instantly successful. I wish other good places underdtood tgat. He also mentioned that even in this location a very short period of time, he's looking to expand. I hope so because I'll be going back and it would be nice not to have an hour wait each time."}
{"text":"So I have to update my review. In my last review I said I would not go back because they closed with no warning, no note on the door, nor no message on their phone. I still think that was bad business and I was annoyed I drove that far away. However, I am so glad I changed my mind and stopped by today. I happen to be in the neighborhood though.

Holy heck in a hand basket, this place is freaking unbelievable! Easily the best place I have eaten at in Phx for wood fire style pizza. The owner chatted with me while I sat at the bar. The staff were amazing in the way they treated me. ( as if I was family) The bread they serve as an app is crazy good and the pizza is the best wood Fire, Artisan style pizza I have had here in Az. Finally,  the Tiramisu is incredible. 

The only bad thing is the place is way too small, loud, and very cramped. I ate at the bar which was a tad better but I usually dislike bar service for dinner. However, it was not that bad. The tables are very close to each other and the place does not have many tables. It must be a nightmare to serve here. Maybe they will expand one day?

Fabio, it was a pleasure meeting and chatting with you. Your staff members are kind and friendly and your food is amazing! Thank you for an amazing experience."}
