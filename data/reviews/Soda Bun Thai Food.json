{"text":"I moved here a year and a half ago and have had some just ok Thai food. I saw the reviews for this place and had to try it. I was not disappointed!!! I got the steamed dumplings, pad Thai (medium) and panang curry. I cannot wait to go back and try their other menu items!! This is the best Thai food I have ever had! I don't think I will go to another Thai place again! I recommend this to everyone!"}
{"text":"Just returned from Thailand and ran into Soda Bun out of curiosity because it is near my home. I fell in with Thai food, and Soda Bun put me back in Thailand. I had the Tom Yum Noodles and special of Jumping shrimp and a meat dish served cold that were all absolutely amazing .I will be recommending Soda Bun to all my friends that have traveled with me to Thailand,  I am sure they will love it as much as I did!"}
{"text":"It's so hard to find a good Thai restaurant. This is the best Thai restaurant I ever go to. I'm a Thai person. I'm so happy that this place is existing. The food was delicious.. I meant Amazing!!!!!.. The cooks here are so friendly and same as the waister!! I really enjoy coming here after work or after school. If you are looking for good or best Thai food to eat. This is the best place to come. The price here is not expensive. Just loving this place! They are so nice. They even gave me free Cheesecake! Soooo!! Good!! I'll for sure some back here. Like you guys, you gotta try it. This place just make my day every time I come through. Some Authentic Thai Restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"My go-to dish is the pad see ew with beef.  Good meat choices and spicy levels for every dish. They also have Thai tea and coffee to quench your thirst."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant today. Fantastic food, great portions and superb service. I ordered medium and it was just right."}
{"text":"We just discovered this gem. The food here is very fresh and full of flavor. My son and I usually order the red curry and the fresh rolls. I love that the restaurant is gluten free with their noodle dishes!"}
{"text":"The food was very good. I was minorly disappointed we  weren't asked to choose heat level. Service was great."}
{"text":"Exactly what I was looking for! Everything was good but the red curry and the fried bananas were killer!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!! Great place to visit. All the dishes we ordered were delicious. Our party had 8 of us so we tried a lot of different dishes. If you like spicy this place delivers. Every dish came out hot and well plated. Service was great and the restaurant was clean. To top all this off they take Polaroid pics of your party so you can hang on the walls to tell others you were there. Great place and I plan on visiting again when we are back in AZ!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was lovely. The staff is amazing, it's clean inside, the food was great! We couldn't be more pleased with our service. It's a mom and pop shop, and they are all smiles. We had the Tom last gai, veggie egg rolls, Thai fried rice, and drunken noodles. All delicious. We will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Well,food is OK. I feel that the taste is too strong. If they can use more authentic oil, vegetables and spices, it would be what I should choose."}
{"text":"Dining room is small however that can make it intimate for date night. We ordered the Pad Thai and the Pad See Ew. With a request of medium spiciness there was just enough seasoning to start to taste the heat. I did the Yelp Check in to get the free Thai Ice Tea, which I did enjoy very much and felt it would help cut the heat of the dish if needed.  Crowd was light for a Saturday night. But that was great for us with immediate seating and fast service. We sat longer, dining and chatting, than we normally would for a Sat night if folks were waiting to get our table.   Portion size was very good and we both had enough for taking some home to enjoy later. Only desire I had for the Pad See We was a larger portion of vegetables. There was plenty of chicken and rice noodles but I would have enjoyed a little more broccoli and carrots. However that may be just because of personal preference."}
{"text":"I don't understand the reviews others have left. I wasn't particularly happy.  My wife and I called while driving because we were going to arrive about 10 mins to closing. We usually try to avoid that, but this was just one of those times where we couldn't.  The lady on the phone didn't sound thrilled but nevertheless acquiesced to serving us.   Honestly I'm not sure why this is such a problem. I figured a 5-star restaurant wouldn't mind someone arriving a few minutes before they close. And to be clear, it's not that she had a major tone or anything but it was obvious she was a little annoyed.  Oh well.  Next we arrived and ordered our meal. The coconut soup was ok at best. The yellow curry chicken was awful. The panang curry beef was awful.  I love Thai food and have lived in the Bay Area where there are some amazing Thai places. I've also been to Thailand (although found my favorite places in the states to be better). So I can on some authority say I know a little about what \"good\" Thai food tastes like -- this my friends is not it.  Maybe it was just a bad day for them. Or maybe the people who order from them have never tried Thai food elsewhere. I don't know, but personally I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Small little dining room in a strip mall, maybe 8 tables.  We noticed a couple logo'd delivery cars so they must do a good delivery business.  Place was clean.  Our server was very friendly and attentive, refilling waters on point.  Food was above average in flavor.  Note their dishes are on the spicy side so order with caution.  I usually order Thai hot at the various Thai restaurants I go to. Here I ordered the Red Curry \"hot\" and it was probably the spiciest Thai I have ever had. Their lunch special includes a salad which was kinda tiny and had what I think was ranch dressing on it.  It was fine but it seemed weird. I like the hot peanut dressing other places have.  The other detail that prevented 5 stars was the walk through the kitchen to get to the single restroom in the back.  Oh, and I HATE chintzy tiny napkins at restaurants, the ones you need 75 of over the course of a meal - they use these. Definitely will be back if I'm ever back in that area, though."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. The vibe of this place at night is very relaxing and the food is completely spot on. I would 100% recommend it for a relaxing night with some good friends."}
{"text":"It was my first visit here and I loved everything! My friend and I had the fresh rolls, veggie rolls, green curry with tofu and finished with the mango sticky rice dessert (so good). Everything was delicious and the flavors were well balanced. They're very accommodating to vegetarians and can substitute - just let your server know. The service was prompt/friendly and their Thai tea is amazing!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time, had the yellow curry. Food was awesome, was a bit more spicy for being mild but still great. Helped clear out my sinuses"}
{"text":"After reading all the rave reviews and a big time fan of Thai food and will drive a ways to try I have to say I was very very disappointed. I called in for pick up on a Friday night around 7:30ish and told me it would be around 15-20 minutes. No biggie as it is a Friday night and they could be busy. When I arrived there were only two couples dinning in and were being tended to what appeared to be the one and only waitress who probably  answered to take my order. No biggie again as it's small, quaint and maybe family operated and my presence was acknowledged.  I did get my order, Drunken Noodles and Spicy Basil fried rice w/ shrimp, but when I arrived home 20 minutes later, the shrimp was not cooked all the way through and translucent looking that I had to pan fry the whole dish to fix it.  I live in North Scootsdale and was not about to drive all the way back. I tried to call, they were still open, to tell them and I received their answering service.  On Saturday I tried calling again cuz they open at 11 and still got their answering service. Never am I going back and all I can say in DINNERS BEWARE!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful ,fresh,extra spicy,our favorite place. Really enjoyed the red curry, pad kapraw,orange chicken, and coconut ice cream."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, friendly service! Dining area is a little cramped but that's par for the course with this sort of place. And - get this - they play background music at a *reasonable* volume! We were able to have an actual conversation!  Pretty sure we're hooked on the pineapple fried rice and the yellow curry now. We'll be back."}
{"text":"First off this place is great Second Hot is HOT. I loooooove spicy and when you think you want Thai hot you might be fine with regular hot."}
{"text":"Great Thai food and friendly service! I usually order for take out and my food is ready in 15-20 minutes.  I recommend the Evil Noodles!"}
{"text":"Excellent break from the average Thai restaurants that litter the valley. It is a tiny establishment but the food is fast, good prices and delicious."}
{"text":"We have eaten in two times and for the first time ordered online. I liked how easy their website is to navigate. The food was just as delicious and the portions were abundant even with the take out.  My favorite is the shrimp pineapple curry, and the fresh rolls. My husband is a picky about portions, he likes big man size portions and he is always satisfied with whatever he orders. Its a cute little place with very sweet staff. I hope the quality remains high so we can continue to curb our Thai food cravings!"}
{"text":"Great lil neighborhood Thai restaurant. Glad we checked it out. Drunken Noodle and Penang Curry was delicious and very very spicy. We will definitely be back here. Excited to have a Thai restaurant within walking distance of our home"}
{"text":"Omg this was so delicious. Service was prompt, place was clean, and was open between the 3-5 hour when most Thai restaurants close. Will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I'm glad that we found this place and a great way to end our night! We had a delicious shrimp roll as a starter, chicken fried rice, Panang beef served with jasmine rice, vegetable eggplant, basil shrimp fried rice and to satisfy our meal we ended sharing the mango with sticky rice and a coconut ice cream. The place is so clean and with a friendly staff especially ying! We will be back!"}
{"text":"First time visiting Soda Bun today and my boyfriend and I were very impressed to say the least! Clean, quaint and intimate space with a super friendly staff. It was quiet when we were there so our food came out ridiculously fast. We ordered the fresh roll and shrimp tempura to start with, both tasty and well portioned. I ordered the Pad Thai and it was by far the best Pad Thai I've ever had. I'm one of those that likes to add spice to the dish once it comes out and it was perfect. (If you ask, they will bring you a platter with sambal, sriracha, soy sauce, pickled jalapeño and crushed peppers) We were so happy to have found a great Thai place that serves excellent food."}
{"text":"The spice level is hit or miss sometimes, thus the 4, but we (my boyfriend and I) have been to Soda Bun several times now. I always order the yellow curry regular/medium heat. Every once in a while it's so hot I get the hiccups, but it's so tasty."}
{"text":"So delicious! My hubby likes Tai and I wasn't to fond of it until we checked out Soda Bun! Love the lemon grass seafood soup!"}
{"text":"Tried Soda Bun after reading some of the reviews (and because I hadn't yet been to another thai place that really made me want to make a repeat visit), and I will definitely be back! I spent 10 weeks in Thailand when I was in college, and while that hardly makes me a good judge of authenticity, it does make me pretty selective as to thai food that I consider to be worth going back for.  I had a thai iced tea, and then shared an order of the thaimari with a friend...both were delicious, so we were off to a good start! Then I had the panang beef for my main meal, on the waitress' recommendation, and wow was it good! So good, in fact, that I couldn't resist an order of mango with sticky rice and shrimp pad thai to go (both of which were equally delicious, even when eaten the next day). The waitress was happy to make recommendations, kept our water refilled, and the food came out really fast, so there weren't any aspects of the visit that weren't great!"}
{"text":"Saw this little gem on Yelp and it was close to work so my wife and I decided to try it. We both love Thai food and we were not disappointed. I had the the Spicy Basil Chicken and my wife the Kang Keow Wan (green curry dish). Both were excellent! The food was great tasting and came out fast which is nice for lunch during work. The service was quick and friendly. Food was hot and both dishes had a very nice presentation. The only con for me was the salad. Had a very sweet dressing on it but that is simply my personal preference. Greens were fresh and crispy. Heat level medium for our dishes was perfect for us, but we tend to like it hot so if your preference is not spicy go with mild. Also, loved the music they played. A very eclectic mix. During our stay I noted artists such as the Bee Gees, Whitney Houston, Player, Lionel Richie, and some modern pop mixed in as well. It was refreshing and relaxing. The prices are very reasonable for the quality of food you get. Portions are not huge but adequate. The dining room is small, so if it gets busy there could be a short wait. We went at 12:30 on a Tuesday and sat right down. A+"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Everything we had was so delicious. I'm ecstatic that this place just moved into the neighborhood. The people that work here are incredibly friendly and the restaurant is cute with a nice, relaxing ambience. We will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food and great service. Started with the Fresh Rolls. I had the devil noodles \"Thai hot\" my Mum had the Panang Beef. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"A nice new gem in the Dobson Ranch area. Simple Thai food served with care and with a very friendly family serving the food. Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Wonderful. Nice atmosphere. Love the lighting. First time ever trying Thai food and I will be back. I was impressed with the food presentation. My Pad Thai even had a beautiful flower made out of a carrot! I enjoy the combination of sweet and hint of spicy the food offered and the portions were very generous. The service was wonderful. Definitely try the Thai tea--very delicious. The waitress even took my boyfriend and I's photo, because it was our first time there-made us feel special."}
{"text":"I'm glad to give this place another five star review. I ordered the drunken noodles and veggie rolls to go. My order was ready within a few minutes. The inside had a cute decor and seemed very clean. The drunken noodles may be the best I've ever had. All the ingredients were fresh and there were even sliced chiles in the dish...don't confuse them with the green peppers!"}
{"text":"Really cute interior, great service, and tasty Thai food. We got a whole bunch of things, shrimp in crisp wonton wrappers (delicious), spicy basil chicken with a serious kick, pad woon sen glassy noodles, and coconut ice cream. Everything was fresh, really flavorful, not too heavy, and had a really nice balance. The medium spice level was just right, actually medium as to not be bland and with a little kick. Overall, so far, Soda Bun Thai is one of my top Thai picks in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Hello and first of all I have to say that It's sooooooooo hard to find an authentic Thai restaurant in AZ, finally, we've found one! The restaurant is in a nice location, easy to find and friendly atmosphere. I was there not long ago with my girlfriend. We were craving for Thai food and been looking for authentic Thai food. Long story short...the food we ordered: Grill Salmon Penang, Pad Pumpkin, Crispy Fish with Sweet and Spicy Sauce, and lastly, Prik Pow Seafood. Four dishes... that's right! All for me and my girlfriend. Food is very delicious and the price isn't high. It's very decent. The taste of Prik Pow is just like what we had in Bangkok! If you don't know what to order, pick from what I ordered. You won't regret. Oh and don't forget to tell them the level of spicy you want."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!  We are frequently having lunch here! Carryout available. Pad Thai is the right portion and not overwhelming with quantity."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the food, and the prices were great. A huge plus for having sticky rice"}
{"text":"Soda Bun. The best Thai place in Mesa.  The food is always on point. Fresh and flavorful.  They use the freshest ingredients and are consistent on everything they make. The family run restaurant is a true delight!  The staff is always friendly and caring toward their customers. I have eaten there at least once a week since they opened.  Try anything on the menu from appetizers to dessert...you will not be disappointed.  I hope you will try them out for a sit down and eat in or take-out treat.  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Food was great, lunch special is super affordable and really kind and generous staff! She brought us a dessert on the house - -  fried banana and ice cream which was so good!  We ordered the peanut chicken and green curry, both of which were delicious.  We also got  a Thai tea and Thai coffee that we used the Yelp coupon for, both were really good, although I prefer the tea. The server was super nice and the food came out quickly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had the thai tea. Fresh roll and red curry. I ordered it thai hot since I've had it before.  I must say. It truly was HOT. Lol. But I ate it all. Thanks to the Mexican in me I handled it like a champ. Very unique place. Super cute."}
{"text":"Best Thai Food I've had in Arizona. Moved over here from LA a while back and couldn't find good Thai food until now! Great service, great environment, GREAT FOOD! Everything was exceptional! The Sum Tom was Amazing, the fresh spring rolls where excellent and chicken satay had great flavor and was very tender! I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I got a chance to Visit in town. I finally found the real authentic Thai foods here. The food and service was fantastic. So reasonable prices. Im highly recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Curries are good, I love the evil noodles. I'm vegan and they're super accommodating. It runs spicy, but I prefer it that way."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  I honestly waited until I had eaten there five times just to be sure it was going to be consistently good before posting a review, but now that my fifth lunch is behind me I can say with zero reservations that this place is truly one of the best.  Friendly atmosphere, very clean, great pricing, and most importantly excellent food.  I think I have found my new favorite Thai restaurant..."}
{"text":"I get the drunken noodles and fresh garden rolls every time and they never disappoint. I love this place !!"}
{"text":"Small but clean establishment, great food and service. Lunch menu has good options and is reasonably priced. Love the pictures on the wall - the kids were excited to see ours was still there."}
{"text":"I took my family (who hate trying new things) to soda bun for the first time and they LOVED it. As did I. Everything was noticeably fresh, we tried several dishes and all where delicious, prices where fair, and service was personable and efficient. We will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, service and selection. Place is trendy, in a good way. Very clean too. Menu choices were great and they will make most of them with all veggies if you wish. Everything was fresh, perfectly prepared. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"First off the ambiance of this restaurant is spectacular, the dim lighting to the tea light candle at the table just draws you right in. The music the play ranges from reggae to oldies to R&B, typically Music isn't something that I ever pay attention to so the fact that I'm mentioning it means something. Now to the food.. crispy dumplings were to DIE for, don't think my grandmas are THAT good. I had ordered the orange chicken and I always have to ask for it extra spicy this time I didn't and I didn't really need to! My partner got the beef and broccoli which again was amazing but also had a darker taste that I never had which made it stand out to me. All in all, think I found my fave place."}
{"text":"The most veggies I've eaten in Arizona the drunken noodle is sweet and spicy I love it the papaya salad was salty spicy and sour with a hint of sweetness the service is good my mouth is burning so I ordered mango and rice pudding it's awesome"}
{"text":"Great first impression. Will definitely visit again. Had some friends over and we ordered dinner & dessert for 4 adults & 4 kids. Smiles all around. The coconut rice with mango was a big hit with the kids."}
{"text":"Very clean!!!  The staff was super friendly!  Let me just say that the food was incredible!  We start d with the shrimp wrapped in crispy wonton wrappers.  Very tasty; the sweet & sour sauce is amazing!  For dinner I had the crispy white fish (Pla Lad Prik) and my friends had the Long  Life Noodles.  Everything was so full of flavor!  Very fresh and just delicious!  Our waitress was very attentive & sweet.  She explained the dishes to us with patience.  They gave us a mango & sticky rice dish for dessert.  None of us had ever had it.  My gosh was it so refreshing & amazingly delicious!  All our dishes from the appetizer, main course and dessert was presented so nicely.  We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"The menu has a good basic selection and most things can be made vegetarian. We ordered veggie rolls, pad Thai with tofu, and evil noodles. Everything was pretty standard and solid. I appreciated that they managed to get that mix of sweet and savory in the pad Thai. The spice level is a bit inconsistent. I ordered my pad Thai medium spicy and it was about what I would expect. My partner ordered his curry mild and it was much hotter than mine. He's a bit of a spice wimp, so he pretty much just didn't eat. We wondered if there had been a mix up so we mentioned it to our server, who was very nice, but also just kind of like whatever about it. I have a feeling if you want \"Thai hot,\" this is your place. The interior was simple but clean. There's no wine/beer on the menu. We'll order again but probably stick to take out and my partner will be avoiding the curries."}
{"text":"The Crispy fried sticky rice fritters were amazing.  The Evil noodles were both Evil and Delicious"}
{"text":"An amazing Thai place. The service is so good. The food is extraordinary. We ordered a variety of dishes, including soups, pad thai. As for the drinks, the Thai tea is out of this world. The people there are super friendly and the location is very convenient and visible. Thanks for being the best restaurant in town! The place is super clean."}
{"text":"Excellent service, very fast. I ordered the pad Thai with beef and it was really good! High recommend this place"}
{"text":"Great place! Came from out of town and picked this place randomly. Food was really good, not the best Thai food I've had but pretty decent. The staff was recently and really attentive and the food came out really quick. I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Environment: The design of the restaurant is plain and simple, wood chairs and wood tables.  Price: very reasonable price, the curry is about $10, huge portion.   Starter: I order the chicken satay, its taste good with the sauce, I dip a lot when I having my chicken. Three chicken sticks in one order.  Main dish: red curry chicken is what they recommend and I decide to try, they didn't ask for spiciness level, but I do love spicy so I'm fine with that. Nice portion for two people.  Dessert: I was trying to order the mango with sticky rices because this is my all time favorite dessert when it comes to Thai food. We ordered coconut ice cream with sticky rice at the end because the waitress told us the mango was not sweet enough. That's so nice of her."}
{"text":"Delicious food & delicious Thai tea. Thanks for great customer service and good Thai food."}
{"text":"Good food. A bit dark, hard to see if the seating and tables are clean. Alright, wear your big Girl/Boy pants.. horrible-one 1, flipping bathroom!"}
{"text":"Good food, the taste is very Thai! but the size of the dishes are a little bit small compared with price. If they improve this issue will be a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Their Pad Thai is amazing and you can order it catered to the heat that you want. Their hot is \"feel it next day hot\". SO. DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"super cute restaurant and really good food! really nice atmosphere, nice waitress and didnt have to wait long at all for our food! we got the yellow curry and eggplant stirfry. also tons of vegetarian options. 10/10 recommend!! also theres a $5 for $10 deal on here that you can use."}
{"text":"I wasn't a Thai lover until today. I read all the reviews and my partner loves Thai so I thought we would try it. I am now a concerted thai cuisine lover. We were greeted with a warm and happy hello from the time we walked in. The decor was warm yet chic and the place was immaculate. I used my check in gift to try Thai Tea and it was a treat to my taste buds..I ordered pineapple fried rice and my partner had Padtai (probably spelled wrong). The food came out plated just right. The taste was everything!!!!!! We fully enjoyed our meal and the attentive servers. I left feeling  ashamed that I had never tried thai until today but my experience today has changed me forever. Try this place, you won't be disappointed ."}
{"text":"I have a saying that you can't find bad Thai food anywhere. And although the food here wasn't bad, it was definitely in the --meh-- category!  I ordered a dish with shrimp in it, and told the waitress that I would like extra shrimp. She told me there was a surcharge, which I saw on the menu there would be, but I couldn't figure out what the dish would have looked like WITHOUT the bonus shrimp!  And by Thai standards, the eggplant with shrimp dish was just ... bland!  Here's something tragically funny: On the window facing the parking lot, the large letters proclaim \"THAI FOOD AT BEST\". I thought it was a typo (Thai food at ITS best), but it turns out that it was correct the first time!"}
{"text":"The food here is nice, I have to admit it. However, it was too spicy for me and my wife. There was a dish on the menu I asked for which was supposed to be not spicy at all (according to the spicy scale), but it was actually spicy. I also want to highlight that the owner's service is fantastic, and this is something I really appreciate.  I would love to be back soon, however, I am not sure if I will be able in the short term."}
{"text":"The food is so bomb.  Had the best pad Thai and the most delicious mango sticky rice!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in because I was in the area  The place was clean, smelled good, and the staff was very friendly. There was some cute polaroid photos on one of their wall that was like a \"friend memory\" vibe.   There was not anything crazy or different about the place but that's not necessarily a bad thing.   The food was good but the amount of it was on the low end, I did get one of their lunch combos so that might be the reason but regardless it was a good price so I can't complain.   The only thing that was \"eh\", was the food was not spicy enough even though I got a mild or medium it was still very sweet in taste but it did not ruin my experience or the food. Just be aware of that if you enjoy food on the spicy end.   I would still stop by if I was in the area and try out some other menu items.  I would recommend this place for their lunch combos.   Oh and they deliver as well I believe for a charge of like $3 or something around that price but it's in a 3-4mile radius I think."}
{"text":"We had the pad Thai and the green curry. The green curry is pretty spicy so you might want to ask them to turn it down a little if you're a weak white boy like me.  The quality of the food was exceptional. Honestly, being a single $ establishment I anticipated lower quality food. I typically look for two $$ or higher. However I must say the chicken was fresh tasting as was all the vegetable dishes. I would give this place only four stars if it was more expensive but for the price it is a five star value.  I will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"This was the cutest little place to come to our date night. I have ordered to go food here at the office for lunch but when you eat it in person the presentation is very nice. The service is great and they are very friendly. It is a very small place but really nicely decorated and very clean. We had the green curry which was absolutely fantastic and I had the beef waterfall salad which I love. You can tell the cook cares about his plates."}
{"text":"Our favorite Thai place. The owners are super friendly. Cute little spot. We love to go for date night. Pad Thai is excellent. Spicy so you have to order no spice. It's perfect for us."}
{"text":"Very good real Thai food!! Super delicious!! Check in here with Yelp! get free Thai ice tea. Staff very nice,friendly  and beautiful Thai girl. I will be back again!!!"}
{"text":"Food and service were excellent! I ordered green curry and Thai fried rice. I must say that the taste is close to authentic green curry and fried rice I used to eat back home. I'll definitely come back here and recommend this to my friends."}
{"text":"Ordered my usual Green Curry and Two orders is Sticky rice ! Medium Heat was perfect  we also got red curry with chicken hot but not Thai heat. Also Perfect! Our favorite of all Thai Fried Rice   presentation is great and prompt service. I wish they would deliver to w 1st ave at my job though. Either way they are my ONLY Thai spot.   Place is very well kept, very intimate, good for cute date night. Dim lighting and very nice set up.   Cute wall of photos. Can't wait till we order again."}
{"text":"Got the golden noodles and they were fantastic! Very cheap and great quality."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite tai restaurant in AZ.  Me and my sister went there and it was flippin awesome!  If you enjoy fresh clean authentic tai food with all of the real authentic spices, flavors and freshness....this is the place to go.  Also the best service ever!  They also put your picture up on the wall of fame, so bring a brush with you.  Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food, Value, Atmosphere, and Service  Food: Excellent -- good as any Thai food I have had. It is on the spicy side Value: Good value for money, especially their lunch specials Atmosphere: I have not eaten inside but when I pick up my order, looks like a small lovely shop that is clean Service: Always liked whoever I talked to when I went to the restaurant. I have never experienced bad service."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to this place.  Ordered - Yellow curry. Spice level was perfect, never saw potatoes in a yellow curry elsewhere, but kinda liked it.  Price on lunch specials -$6.99. Comes with a spring roll and small portion of salad.  Not the best thai food, but best one in a driving distance.  Decent ambience, soft music, fast service. I would rate 4.5*"}
{"text":"Delicious! Stopped in here on a whim when the other Thai place I was planning to visit was closed on a Monday.  Soda Bun is a quaint, but clean little spot in the middle of the strip mall, near Angry Crab.  The place was nearly empty at 530pm and I was able to grab a booth along the wall.  I met a friend and we ended up sharing some Tom Yum soup, which was really tasty.  I ordered it vegetarian, so just veggies.  The broth was hot and a nice medium spice, which builds as you continue to eat.  Was great for clearing out my sinuses!  haha ... On to meals, I got the panang curry with veggies and tofu.  My friend ordered the yellow curry with chicken.  Both plates came out within about 10 -15 minutes.  A nice portion of food and big scoop of white rice.  The panang was really good.  I would have liked the tofu more if it was cooked in smaller pieces and a bit more firm, but I didn't dislike it in the dish.  My friend enjoyed her yellow curry and had leftovers to take home.  We didn't have room for dessert, but maybe on a future visit!  Its def a place I would go back to if I was in the area and hungry for Thai.  =)"}
{"text":"Nice simple & small restaurant. The wait staff was polite & friendly to me.  The decor was minimalist.  The food was pretty good to good. In particular, the beef waterfall was very tasty but very spicy. The meat was tender & well seasoned. I will have it again at my next visit.   The Pad Woon Sen was cooked right, with the right amount of sauce. Some other restaurants cooked this dish either too wet or too dry. This one was right on. So was the Kua Kai, which used the wide rice noodle, instead of the glass noodle in the Pad Woon Sen.  The Pla Lad Prik, crispy tilapia with vegetables in a light sweet & sour sauce, was pretty good. The batter was light, which meant I was able to taste the fish. The fish, though, could use a tad more seasoning. But the sauce was oh so good.   The sticky rice & mango dessert was the only dish I wished to improve. The sticky rice was cooked right; the mango was perfectly ripe & sweet. But this dessert could be so much better if it had more coconut milk.  At my next visit, I will request more coconut milk in this dessert dish.  Overall though, I like this restaurant and plan to visit it again."}
{"text":"Great Food, Nice Service, Good Prices!  To start this review off obviously I should start with the most important aspect of my visit. The food was absolutely delicious. I found it to be a very authentic Thai restaurant with decent size portions and really good prices!  Our waitress was friendly and kept our water cups full as we ate our delicious food. The atmosphere was clean and inviting.  We found a spot on yelp because of its high five star rating on food and were not disappointed at all! This place deserves it's five star rating for sure.  Stop by and give them a taste you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time reviewing anything. This place is simply brilliant. Great food, great service, and great ambiance. From appetizers to entrees the food could not taste better. Glad everywhere else was closed so that we could find this gem! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great little place! I've tried a variety of dishes, and they've all been quite good. The service is very good, very attentive, and the prices are very reasonable. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp and figured I'd give it a try.  I had the drunken noodles and the veggie rolls.  I asked for it to be Thai hot, meaning super spicy.  I was so impressed with this restaurant.  It was very clean and the 2 ladies that helped me were super friendly and kind!  They had wonderful customer service!  I would highly recommend this place, my food came out super spicy like I like it and it was fresh and all around delicious.  This will definitely be my new Thai food place"}
{"text":"Delicious food!!!  Ambience is nice and mellow, perfect for a nice experience with friends, family or your love ones. Service was fast. Prices are fair. We got tom yum soup with noodles, green curry and drunken noodles, everything was yummy!  Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Clean! Good prompt service! And all 5 of us loved our dish. This was our first visit and it will not be our last. Hit the spot"}
{"text":"Delish- with a kick!! My family & I love Thai food. I was living in Flagstaff for awhile, and for a small city they had a lot of Thai cuisine. After moving down here I haven't been able to find anything that measures up.. until now! We ordered chicken pad Thai, a seafood curry, & basil beef. Let me warn you the food is spicy, but it tastes amazing. We all loved it!"}
{"text":"Ms Ying was doing a good job for cooking pad Thai and it was very spicy but very good food"}
{"text":"Tasty food. Great service. Only been there twice, the owner remembered my previous order. Lunch special is a good deal. The Thai tea is right amount of sweetness.   The Tom Yang noodle is very special, which I have never seen in other thai restaurants in Phx. The spiciness doesn't come down too much like a lot of other Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"The cute little place to get good Thai food. After the long busy week my Thai girl friend and I decided to escape from the kids to get real Thai food that we do not need to cook and clean. This place is the rigth place for us.  Tum Yum Talay, Hot and  Spicy Sea food Soup (We ordered for real Thai taste) came in the big bowl with big fresh shrimp, scallopes, musselles, squites, and fresh white mushroom. This warm me up in the cold night with the spicy Thai herbs peices of garlunga, kaffer lime leaf  lemon grass and crush fresh Thai pepper. This made feel like back home in Thailand.  Rad Naa Kung, came with big fresh shrimp and fresh broccoli in very tasty thick sauce. Thick Noodle was really tender and tast so good.   Mango and Sticky rice, Yellow mango gets cut like a flower with a heart shape of soft sticky rice with creamy coconut milk at the end of the meal made my evening.  The staffs are nice and frienly. This family owned restuarant is nice to get fresh and clean authentic Thai food,"}
{"text":"Food is excellent, and they will substitute dishes that contain meat, for tofu, or extra veggies. As a VEGAN I am more than pleased with this new restaurant. Vegans & vegetarians  have many options to choose from on the menu. I'm so happy this place is within walking distance of my home!! Friendly staff, small, cozy restaurant+ great food."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I stopped in for a weeknight dinner because we were exhausted and didn't want to cook but didn't want fast food.  This place is so clean, small, and has amazing service and food! Quick plates came out, waters refilled without asking and even great prices. We will now be regulars!!!  Two thumbs way up!"}
{"text":"Very good. I got the lunch special Galee Gai which was a yellow curry with chicken, onions, and potatoes served with rice. It was delicious!  The lunch special also came with a nice side salad and an egg roll, which were both excellent. I also got a Thai iced tea and I don't usually like them but I liked the one I got here.  Not only was the food delicious, it was cheap! Lunch special ran me 7 dollars and some change. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It's been difficult finding a place out here that even compares to the Thai food I had while living in LA. Guess you really don't know what you got until it's gone. Shameless Plug Warning: (try \"It's Pho\" in Hollywood if you ever find yourself there) I gave up my Thai paradise quest until yesterday and I'm really happy I gave this spot a chance. It is small and intimate with v homey vibes. We even made friends with two other patrons that were dining in. The service from the young gentleman at the front was friendly, attentive and on point. The food was really tasty. I ordered the papaya salad which tasted just as good as the one I'd get back home. Fresh af with just the right amount of heat to open up the sinuses which is appreciated because allergy season is upon us. I also ordered the Thai veggie noodle soup (gluten free and vegetarian) which was flavorful and had plenty of veggies. I would have given them 5 stars but my mom wasn't a huge fan of the beef waterfall salad she ordered. The flavor was amazing but the quality of beef was lacking and left much to be desired. All in all, I definitely will be back to try new items on the menu. 4.5/5 would recommend!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Ambiance is adorable and they take your picture at the end on an instant camera where the pictures are all over a side wall. So cute :) I got the yellow curry, my friend got the drunken noodles, and we shared the fried banana ice cream at the end. It was SO good. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great service and excellent food. Try the Galee Gai curry you won't be sorry!  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Very good food! We ordered the dumplings pan seared and I wish we had gotten them extra crispy - they were very doughy. Yellow curry and pad Thai (both with chicken) were very tasty! Will definitely go here again. (Plus, they have delivery!)"}
{"text":"Great new Thai place!  I saw this place pop up on Yelp a few weeks ago with 5 stars so I had been dying to give it a try.  Well it did not disappoint!  Great service, food cooked perfectly with the perfect amount of spice.  We always go with medium spice when we first try a place to gauge the spice levels.  Well, medium was perfect.  Spicy, but not too spicy.  My Pad See Ew was amazing with perfectly cooked veggies.  I also tried a bite of the BF's Thai Fried Rice which was just as tasty.  So much flavor!  The crispy veggie spring rolls we also perfect.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Saw this place had rave reviews, so went ahead and called in for a pad Thai chicken, medium spice and headed to the restaurant to pick up. First walked in, it was cute and cozy. The interior and decorating was nice, and music was great. Staff was very friendly.   The food came in a cute To-go box. First bite and it was delicious! Raved about it to my family and friends. I usually stick to a few favorite Thai places, but this has become one of my top for the valley. Very hole in the wall, but must try!"}
{"text":"We stopped by this establishment on our way home from the airport not knowing this would be some of the best Thai food in the valley!! We ordered the green curry, garlic chicken and chicken fried rice. All the the dishes were very flavorful with the right amount of spice added with no additional changes needed from the menu. The green curry blew me away, it was curl your toes good!!  The restaurant was a casual neighborhood Thai spot, small but cute. I can't wait to eat here again to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"First time here. Came for the lunch special. Was super good with a super friendly host :-) Will be back."}
{"text":"We used to order delivery here frequently but the last time we ordered, the curry we received was less than half the portion as the previous times. Considering the prices here, that's almost unforgivable.   We might give them one more chance since the food is good, or maybe we'll just order from one of the other Thai places that delivers and is not cutting back on portions."}
{"text":"Authentic family owned business with mom and dad cooking amazing food in the kitchen. The son and daughter wait tables.  Food is fantastic. The pad Thai chicken and Panang curry chicken are delicious!  We will be back"}
{"text":"I would actually give this 3 1/2 stars if that was an option. The staff are very nice, the prices are quite reasonable, and the decor is nice (love the exposed filament lightbulbs). It's got a mellow, peaceful ambiance and was very quiet and cozy on a Wednesday night. I would give all of these things 4 or 5 stars.   The reason we would not come back is the food. It's not bad; it's just all right, maybe 3 stars. We liked the Pad See-Ew better than the Pad Thai, which was extremely spicy, but neither were our favorites. So it's an okay place, just not a go-to place for us."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with very friendly staff.  Absolutely love their pad thai! My date had the pad pumpkin pork and I had to pretty much wrestle her to share a bit! Prices were very affordable and i can't wait to come back in!"}
{"text":"Best Thai in Mesa. Period. We've tried them all. Soda Bun delivers time and time again. Try the drunken noodles if you're a noodle fan, or ask for the red coconut chicken curry for something a lil different. Delivery service is quick. Major props."}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy shrimp fired rice and it was real good and had about 6-8 pcs of shrimp! Small mom and pop place but good quality food and very clean!"}
{"text":"Soda Bun serves authentic Thai food. They know their Thai broccoli and Lad Na, and pineapple fried rice. We are Asian and have been to Thailand and can say their food is quite authentic and delicious. The name Soda Bun means you will go to food Nirvana...meaning, after eating, you will leave happy and fulfilled, and all your wants and cravings will be satisfied and you will be at peace:)"}
{"text":"The mango sticky rice here is so perfectly delicious.. add coconut ice cream to it and you're in heaven. Green curry was also amazing. Loved the bamboo shoots and eggplant in it. This place is probably one of the better places in our area, but I can't say it's the best. Will come back for those 2 items though!"}
{"text":"Really, really good Thai food!  The restaurant is super clean and the staff is very friendly.  Make sure you try the Thai tea if you go.  I had the yellow curry and veggie rolls.  Everything was excellent!  Stoked they are in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"If you come to mesa,az have to check out this little cute Thai place so yummy I got spicy pad kee mao very tasty and you can get to try a free Thai tea when u r check in here it's worthy!!"}
{"text":"First of all - the music is always amazing.  Like, every 90s hit that you somehow remember all of the words to, back to back, every time I've been here.  All of the food is delicious, and I always enjoy a fresh coconut and mango sticky rice!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food . We ordered drunken noodles , pad kee now and spring rolls . For dessert we ordered Mango sticky rice with a side of coconut ice cream . The service was excellent and food was very memorable . Highly recommended !!!"}
{"text":"According to the website, Soda Bun stands for the person going to Nirv?na. I was there yesterday afternoon! I had my food delivered to my door. I ordered the dumplings, pad Thai, and cha yen (Thai iced tea). I ordered dumplings because I thought they'd be more like moneybags, however, they were more like pot stickers. Nonetheless, I appreciated the crispiness to them. The pad Thai, was crunchy, spicy, and delicious; I ordered it with shrimp. Finally, the cha yen was delicious, however, the cup size and amount of ice left much to be desired. Nevertheless, I appreciate Soda Bun for delivering and being close by for me to order from. The best part about delivery, no fee. Bonus points for polite delivery man."}
{"text":"Love this tiny little gem. Came for dinner with a friend and it was awesome. It is small so get there early otherwise you may have to wait. The service is great and they have the best rice! Went back for lunch a week or so later and they have great lunch menu that is very affordable and fast but still good quality. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are regular users of Eat24's delivery service, but we often get tired of the same places that deliver to our neighborhood. So imagine my delight when I logged on this evening to see a new thai place with delivery available -- and with nearly 5 stars! We ordered around 7:45 and had our delivery by 8:15 (which is pretty fast for delivery in this area). The delivery guy was super friendly. He even addressed me by name when handing me the food, which is a nice touch (and something the majority of delivery drivers don't do). And the food was delish! I ordered Pad Thai, and my husband ordered Pad Khing Sod. Both were super tasty, fresh and with just the right level of spiciness. So glad to have Soda Bun Thai in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant in town!! Feeling like my hometown with warm heart owner and the most impressive manager! I would recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Been looking for a go-to thai spot since we moved out here from cali and in the 6 months we've been here, we have found ONE decent place...this is NOT it. Service was great, and the space was nice-which are soba bun's only saving grace, everything else fell flat. Perhaps our standards are higher given the countless thai restaurants we were fortunate enough to be surrounded by... but even the worse thai spot we'd been to in cali was better than this. The food wasn't bad, it just wasnt very good.   Like many, we use pad thai as the standard in determining if a thai spot is worth a second try, even if everything else ordered may be less than stellar...if the pad thai is solid then--well done, we'll most likely give it a second go if in the area..but even that wasnt up to par to the worst in cali. The noodles were wrong, didnt have that stickyness one often associate with pad thai and flavor was so-so, not bad but not good... So disappointed, had high hopes and was let down. We also ordered the papaya salad combo  with chicken and sticky rice which  we were super excited about, not many have such a combo, even in cali...but the sticky rice was NOT sticky, papaya salad was so sad. Totally lack luster, no flavor-not even mild (which is usually our complaint-love that burn your tongue spice) it was just bland. The chicken...wow, the chicken, dry and flavorless, didnt even come with peanut sauce or any for that matter.   Then, there was the thai tea...free with a check in--and even still...never again--watered down, and just sweetened to mask the lack of tea...why?!?!...ah such a sad day for thai food..."}
{"text":"Small little restaurant with great flavor. The yellow curry and orange chicken were perfect, the presentation was the cherry on top. Our waitress was extremely attentive and never let our waters get below half way. Will return soon as I can't stop dreaming about the curry."}
{"text":"This was our first time here, food was fantastic, love the Thai tea very friendly and great prices"}
{"text":"The shrimp pad Thai is amazing! I always get chicken skewers and shrimp spring rolls also with extra peanut sauce. One of my favorite Thai restaurants around!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in mesa ! Came here for lunch at this cute little place ! Great service , delicious food ! Definitely come back for more ! On a second note they should replace the ranch dressing for the salad with peanut dressing !!!!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love Soda Bun Thai! It's a small quaint neighborhood restaurant that serves up some authentic Thai food and has incredible service as well! My family and I love this place- great prices, clean restaurant, yummy food and all around service with an abundance of smiles, oh yeah and I can't forget to mention that all of this is accompanied by awesome 80's music!  Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"I walked in to order and the ladies taking orders were very nice. Told me that it would take 10 min, which I thought that would be fast. I don't even think it took that long.   I have been looking for a good Pad Thai, this place exceeded my expectations. Just enough spice for me, enough tasty sauce, noodles cooked perfectly and tender shrimp. My husband got the Thai Fried Rice and we asked for it to be spicy and it was perfectly spicy for him.  We WILL be back"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem.  As the evening went on the lighting dimmed and enhanced the ambiance.  The food is amazing!  I had the green curry with shrimp and was blown away.  The desserts were unreal, particularly the Thai custard with coconut sticky rice.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food, nice and spicy! Tasted authentic, cute decor and nice customer service.  Got the Pad Thai, panang curry, green curry, som tum, calamari, mango sticky rice- IT WAS ALLL DELICIOUS"}
{"text":"Exceptional service and great flavorful Thai food. I've come back 3 times since first trying Soda Bun and have never been anything short of impressed. Pricing is also exceptionally reasonable."}
{"text":"Soda... Bun? I know what soda bread is, but what is a soda bun? After eating here I still don't know what it is, but I do know they serve delectable Thai delights here!  The restaurant is a bit small and has only a few tables but the interior is warm, cozy and contemporary. The menu has some of your old standards such as pad Thai and drunken noodles but also has some more unique dishes you won't find at your average Thai restaurant. Note that unlike other Thai restaurants, most of the selections here come with a protein already picked out with the dish rather than having you choose what you want. As a result there aren't a lot of vegetarian options since most of the dishes have some sort of meat in them unless you make a special request.  We started with the fresh rolls, and I had an item off the chef's special menu, the pla rad prik (Fried tilapia with bell pepper in chile sauce). The fresh rolls had a mixture of crisp vegetables, soft noodles, and warm peanut sauce. The pla rad prik was a hefty dish, comprised of two large pieces of tilapia covered in a sweet sauce with diced bell peppers. The tilapia was fried to a light crisp and the fish itself tasted good. The sauce wasn't too spicy; it was more on the mild side to me. I liked the crunch of the bell pepper with the sauce and the crisp fish. As I ate more bites though the more I got tired of the one-dimensional sweetness of the sauce.   I had a Thai iced tea with my meal which was served in a mason jar. It was refreshing but a bit too sweet for my tastes.  Dessert was a lovely mango sticky rice. It was such a nicely done presentation, with the perfect mango slices wrapped in a floral pattern, with a heart shaped mound of coconut milk infused rice to go with it. The sweet mango went well with the creaminess and salty-sweet flavor of the rice.  Service was friendly and we were checked on as needed.  We had a good time here and it's a cute little place to get Thai food. I'll be back!  EDIT: OK I just read the owner's comments so now I know what soda bun is. :) Perhaps an explanation on the menu might help for those that aren't aware!"}
{"text":"This evening I ordered at this restaurant and they got my order wrong. While this was frustrating, it wasn't a big deal. I sent my fiancé to exchange what we got for what we ordered and called the restaurant to alert them. They said ok, verified the order, and apologized.  Not five minutes later I got a call back from an employee on her cell phone asking me why I didn't say tofu when I ordered. Since we're vegan, I assured her that I did. She continued to argue with me and tell me that she couldn't fix our order because I didn't order it correctly. I insisted that I did, and she continued on. Then she hung up on me.  So I called back and asked for the manager. Turns out, that was her. I told her that I hoped she was going to fix the situation since it wasn't great customer service to hang up on a customer. She then told me again that she wouldn't fix it, told me I hung up on her, and was generally rude. I will never be back, and I'd advise you not to go either."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner, order the DrunkenNoodles w/ beef, it comes with a medium spice level, it was really good! I checked in and received the free Thai iced tea, it was good, my first time trying it. Service was prompt and friendly.  Will definitely be back to try one of the lunch specials."}
{"text":"I think I just found my new favorite Thai dish. Evil Noodles. Don't be scared by the name, these noodles are angelic. Spicy, but perfectly balanced with flavors. Seriously good. GF had Pad Thai, their sauce is so rich and full of flavor, one of the better pad thai's I've ever had.  Thai Iced tea for free check in is a no brainer!"}
{"text":"This new Thai restaurant is relatively small, but has a nice, clean interior. The lunch special starts at $6.95, and weekly entree specials are posted outside, from which I chose a variation of drunken noodles that included chicken and shiitake mushrooms. I also ordered a Thai ice tea, which was similarly good to that of other Thai restaurants.   The food was prepared impressively quick, leaving me with most of my tea left to enjoy with the meal. The noodles had a nice balance of spice (at the medium heat level) without being overwhelming. I was able to try a bit of the \"jungle curry\" special as well. It was made with a red curry base that had an excellent flavor.   A complementary dessert in the form of beautifully realistic gelatin peppers was served at the end of the meal. They were filled with a type of mildly sweet bean paste."}
{"text":"This place makes pretty good food and I'm happy to have a Thai food restaurant in the neighborhood again.    I like to get the Drunken Noodles and recommend starting with this dish first. Have tried others as well but this one is my favorite.  Check out the lunch specials to save a few bucks. The spring rolls are delicious; the sweet sauce to dip them in is yummy."}
{"text":"Lunch special under $7 including a sad salad and spring roll. Pad Thai was a little dry and sticky but it was flavorful and spicy. Tofu fried perfectly with big flavorful pieces. Will definitely be back, only for takeout as the a/c was very low and room was warm."}
{"text":"Been here couple time and everything has been great. Reasonable price. Service is wonderful, friendly both(2 ladies) are very pleasant. I ordered beef Panang is so yummy. Beef is very solf and sauce is pretty thick(it's really good). My friend ordered Drunken noodle on Lunch special $6.69 and add shrimp for $2. Her lunch come out with veggie roll  on the side. Wow... THAT IS SO GOOD PRICE?       Place was very clean and they also take a polaroid picture of us and put on the wall it was very fun. I will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"The pad Thai was good. Veggie spring rolls good too. Fast service. Easy to order take out on phone."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant! I get the green curry every time, it's super delicious!"}
{"text":"We were on the east side of town and decided to try Soda Bun on a Saturday night. This place is in a shopping center by Angry Crab Shack.   We walk in around 8pm and it's totally empty. There is about 10 tables. A few Asian decorations but what stood out were the two brick walls. Not very well decorated. So we got the pick of the litter on our table. We were greeted right away and asked for our drink orders. I got a free Thai iced tea with my Yelp check-in (woo hoo).   We started out with the Fresh Rolls with Shrimp added. They give you two rolls cut in half. First thing we noticed is how fresh it was. The skin to the fresh veggies were so good. You can tell the difference. Probably the best I've had. The peanut dipping sauce made it really good. I thought it was great.   We also had the Shrimp Rolls. It came with four and it was like Shrimp rolled up in an egg roll skin and fried. It was pretty good. Not bad.   I ordered the Pad See-Ew with my choice of protein and I got the beef. What I noticed is that it was so fresh. Noticed it was really fresh. Noodles, veggies, and beef. Fresh. I requested the heat level 2 but really didn't taste any heat. To be honest, it was very fresh but didn't have a lot of flavor but it was good.   My wife got the Pad Thai with chicken and I grabbed a few bites. It was very fresh. Good. Little lacking in flavor but good. Also not too sweet. Some pad Thai is overly sweet but this wasn't too sweet but good.   My daughter got the Drunken noodle. Her main stay and she liked it too. So it was pretty good.   We couldn't pass up dessert and I asked them if the Mango was still in season or not and they told me they had one Mango left. Yipeee. We got the Mango sticky rice and it was really good. Fresh mango. Sweet rice. Prefect. Loved the sticky rice.   So while we were there we were the only table. Had two take outs and found out that they just opened a month ago. The one cool thing is for their sit down customers is they take a Polaroid picture of us. Give you some pens to write on your picture then they put it on the brick wall. Look me up on the wall. I'm there. Hahaha.   So this is a really small place. Family owned. Good service. Good food but lacking in an atmosphere. I love supporting local businesses. I'll be back again to try their other dishes too. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Only place in the valley I've found that makes a legit khao soi. It was a special one day but ask the kitchen if they can make it. If they can't, the evil noodles is very similar. This spot also actually makes their food spicy so if you're not sure if you can handle it, err on the side of caution."}
{"text":"Spicy chicken basil and pad see ew my favorite!!!  They also make a great papaya salad without shrimp and crab. You can add it if you like. I don't have a picture, we ate it.  They have a check in special that gives you a free Thai iced tea too!  Happy birthday to my friend Sue"}
{"text":"Great food! Nice atmosphere. Great service. Had the Pad thai and the Drunken Noodles. Both were delicious. :)"}
{"text":"The phone and in house service was great.  Food was tasty.  I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"Soda Bun Thai Food was quite great. The restaurant's name had me unsure of what to expect, but I did enjoy my experience. I order a Steamed Tofu Pad Thai with the \"Medium\" level of spiciness. I didn't realize the mild had a decent amount of spicy on its own, so the medium definitely had a kick. The dish tasted delicious and had a great presentation which I feel often times is overlooked.  The space itself is small but cozy with the unique lighting and wall of polaroids. I also checked in on Yelp and received a free Thai Iced Coffee which was absolutely delicious and not a disappointment at all. I would definitely go back to this restaurant and I recommend you to check it out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for lunch.  I had the green curry chicken, he had the spicy basil chicken.  Both were delicious!  Heat level was medium as promised. Portions for the lunch special are good for the price.  Service and ambiance were delightful.  We have been looking for a good Thai place near both of our offices and we have found it - we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great prices. Hot, fresh, delicious, authentic. Friendly and fast service. We will be back for sure! Beautiful, small, clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery to my hotel, food came quick, fresh veggie rolls were good.  Ordered eggplant chef specialty, ordered it as vegetarian w/ extra vegetables.  Came with both extra shrimp and extra chicken. So yeah, what more can I say about it."}
{"text":"I ordered my food over the phone and it was ready within 15 minutes. Service was friendly. I ordered the Drunken Noodles with Chicken and a Thai Iced Tea. Both were delicious. Everything was at a reasonable price as well. Thai food is one of my absolute favorites, I'm thrilled that this restaurant is near my new job."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. Very friendly and efficient! The food was delicious! Both my husband and I ordered our dishes \"medium\" and they packed a punch! So if you are sensitive to spicy food, go with mild! The veggies were cut fresh and the meat was good quality. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Three of us went there and ordered: -evil noodle : wife had to go restroom after eating this (very evil) -pad seew : just ok..i would rate 7 out of 10 -panang beef: very little meat imo  -Fresh roll: Really good and i like it. Beware when asking extra sauce (2 oz cup)..they charge $1.50 without telling you in the bill."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and ordered my go-to Thai dish: Panang Curry. Service was fast, and the lunch specials were very reasonably priced.  I really appreciate that the menu items come with a standard protein and spiciness for each dish. Of course, you can order it however you want, but it's nice to know when I'm trying a new dish that I'm ordering it the way it was meant to be.  The beef in the panang was tender, and the spice level was just right for me. It was topped with shredded lime leaf, which some places unfortunately skip. The side-salad was slightly on the boring side, but the dressing was quite nice.  I'll definitely be back for lunch!"}
{"text":"Soda Bun Thai Food!  Authentic Thai food, lots of flavors, a variety of items to chose from on the menu.  You get a free thai tea with a Yelp check in. I'm not sure if it's every time..   You can add different levels of spice to your food like usual. And don't forget to try the mango sticky rice dessert!"}
{"text":"one of the best thai food places that i've been too staff is extremely nice and food was amazing definitely will come again."}
{"text":"This is what you want.  Fabulous Thai food!  As a Thai food lover, we have our favorite 3 places in the valley.  This place is now in rotation.  Utterly satisfying.   I had the Thai Fried Rice, medium heat ... girlfriend had Pad See Ew which she thoroughly loved. (And I finished for her).  We handed back two clean plates.  Just be careful about the heat, medium was more like medium-hot.  So, play it on the safe side when they ask \"how hot\"?"}
{"text":"I am particular about food quality and of course, taste. The food here is very fresh and tasty! The service is great and I always feel welcome. I'm glad Soda Bun is in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This is a great little place!  It was totally empty when we got here, but it must be because the secret is not out yet!  We did the Yelp check in and got a free Thai Iced Tea, which was one of the best ones I've ever had!  Between us we ordered the extra crispy dumplings, edamame, Evil Noodles, pineapple fried rice and Pad See Ew.  We also ordered the Mango & Sticky Rice dessert.  Every single thing was DELICIOUS.  We had quite a debate over whose meal was the best ;). Our server was very sweet, and super attentive, our drinks barely ever got lower than 1/2 full.  We will definitely be back and highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Yum... evil noodles were great.  Next time I'll add a side of rice to add at the end. Yummy."}
{"text":"Quick to be seated and a very sweet welcome. The food here is great too. We thoroughly enjoyed all of our meals. Plus the appetizers were on point. The coconut cream cake was not what we expected and failed to wow us. It was too sugary and not cream like at all, maybe just a little overpriced too. But all n all we had a great meal and would return for more."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food and their green tea is spectacular! I ordered the green curry and it comes as a two. I love really spicy food so I thought about upping it but my friend who also likes spicy food and is a regular there told me not to so I didn't! There 2 is like a 5 at most thai restaurants. You have been warned and I usually get 5s. We also got their fresh roll and dumplings. Both were amazing. Definitely give this place a try if you are craving thai!"}
{"text":"So, let me tell you about Soda Bun Thai Food. This was my first experience eating Thai food and I had been literally dying (on the floor, clutching my chest) to try it. So, while at work one day, I looked up places close to my job and came across Soda Bun and they had really good reviews and a check-in offer for a free Thai iced tea and that pretty much made up my mind. I called ahead since I wanted to dine in but only had a thirty minute lunch and the woman on the phone asked if I could there in about 6 to 10 minutes I said yes but didn't get there until a little after 10 minutes and expected my food to be in a to-go container but to my surprise it was plated and waiting for me! I was literally flabbergasted, the table was set up so cute and my heart melted.   I ordered the lunch special drunken noodles Thai because after doing my Yelp research, I determined that was where I wanted to start. I've since tried pad Thai and I much, much prefer drunken noodles. The lunch special portion just right the right size as I ate enough to fill me up and still had a bit to take back with me to work. It also comes with a spring roll and I'm not a huge spring roll fan but this one was great. Boy, it was HOT. I didn't know that you could specify the level of heat you wanted so I didn't and my mouth was on fire. It was like a deep burning heat in my mouth that I wish I had prepared myself for because I like heat but this was something else. I was sweating, lol. The sweet, concerned waitress kept bringing me more water because I'm sure she could tell I had literally bitten off more than I could handle. I'm not sure if it was tap water but it didn't taste like Arizona tap water so I was thankful for that. Thank God I had redeemed my check-in because that Thai iced tea held me down. It was sweet but not overbearingly so like some others I've tried. In spite of how hot it was, I could not stop eating. It was so flavorful and delicious, I was instantly on a Thai food kick and honestly, Soda Bun has been the best thus far. Five stars across the board - for the food, the atmosphere, and the hospitality. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering from here and it did not disappoint. The food was so fresh and delicious. We got the chicken pad Thai, Thai fried rice and a couple of Thai teas. We will definitely be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"We were excited about all the reviews before heading out to this place and it does live up to its reputation.  We started out with Papaya Salad, Tom Gha Gai (Coconut Soup), Red Curry and Fish that were absolutely delicious.  We completed the meal with beautifully presented Mango (Presented like a Rose), and sticky rice in the shape of the heart.  Lost one star when we presented with Groupon for 50% but was told that they do not accept them and told me to call the company to get a refund.  Feeling a little switch and baited, we should base our experience on the service, presentation, execution, and resolution.  The place would have earned a 5 star rating except what happened at the end.  They gave us $5 discount for our trouble..That said, you should still discover this hidden gem in the heart of Mesa"}
{"text":"Took the family here to try something new and we were not disappointed. The wife and I tried the Tom Gai? soup and it was really spicy. For entrees we had yellow curry, panang curry, and the pad thai. All 3 dishes were really good. I'd recommend this place to anyone. Service was good and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"We ordered take out on a Friday night, and were pleasantly surprised by the new spot (to us at least). The food was timely, easy online ordering, and the staff was friendly. The only reason for the lack of a star is that I ordered mild and that is NOT what we got. I'm a self-admitted wimp when it comes to heat but most places mild is no problem. We will definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"Thai cuisine is a perfect blend of flavors - salty, sweet, sour, bitter and spicy.  Almost every Thai dish combines all five tastes.   I was given the heads up from Jib W. to give this new Thai eatery a try. After FINALLY finishing my Christmas shopping, I figured I deserved some delicious food! Soda Bun did not disappoint.   We started with my beloved Tom Kha. The predominant flavor was citrus. I really enjoyed the fresh mushrooms but I miss the creamy mouthfeel of rich coconut milk. It was still a light and delicious bowl of soup on a chilly Saturday night. We also ordered Pad Thai and Panang Beef. For $8.99 an entree, I wasn't expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised by how big the portions were (especially for the Pad Thai)! The Pad Thai had delicate flavor. It was marked as a mild dish but I couldn't taste much spice at all. This is not a deal breaker since you can ask for more heat on the side.  I kind of wish there was a stronger tamarind flavor. The Panang Beef was great though. Good medium heat, strong flavors, and tender beef. We also ended up getting the mung bean chili peppers for dessert. The artistry was amazing because they looked so real! All this was washed down with refreshingly sweet Thai iced teas.  Service was excellent, the restaurant is clean, the food is hot and fresh, and the prices and portion sizes are great. Wishing Soda Bun much success!"}
{"text":"Unpretentious, comfortable atmosphere...Great service. Food great and not huge, overwhelming quantities. Yum."}
{"text":"This is a new favorite Thai restaurant of mine! I've been hesitant to visit any after a food poisoning experience at another local Thai restaurant but this one has restored my faith that there ARE good Thai restaurants around. Everything on the menu is delicious and I greatly appreciate the fact that they have vegan options as well as meat - I don't have to worry about choosing a restaurant when I'm eating out with friends! I especially love their coconut ice cream and fried bananas! (The picture is from a recent delivery purchase, sorry to not include the meal didn't think of it until afterwards)"}
{"text":"Soda bun food is to die for !!!! This is the best Thai food I have ever had in my life!!!! The curry is sooo amazing and so are the drunken noodles !  The place so so cute !!! Very quite and intimate for a nice dinner. Couldn't say enough about this place !! It's a hidden gem !"}
{"text":"i liked this spot but i can't really judge it since all the food was too spicy for my boyfriend and i LOL. we were just chuggin our waters and thai iced teas between each bite. i wanted to try the mango sticky rice but didn't get to. i would come again if they could adjust the levels of spice in their dishes."}
{"text":"Small portions compared to others but food tastes great and the service is very good. Good luck to this new biz"}
{"text":"Holy cow, this place is AWESOME. Just discovered that this place is right around the corner from me AND they deliver AND they have online ordering. The food is awesome too!"}
{"text":"Small family restaurant with 5 star chef and delicious entrees served at just the right temperature!  I had the chicken green curry with medium spice and the \"burn\" was just right!  The brown rice was steamed to perfection and the waitress was friendly and cordial.   The brewed iced tea was refreshing as well. I will definitely be back !! I saw a group of the staff of a competitors restaurant dining here....that's when you know the chef is great !  Check this place out !"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed numerous dishes at this restaurant now and everything has been extremely well prepared with excellent flavor. After experiencing Thai food in Seattle for years, this is the first restaurant in the East Valley that I have found gets anywhere near the degree of authentic ingredients and preparation style that I was used to. Go and eat and enjoy the food. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Wife and I trying new place for dinner.  I lived in Thailand for 6 months, love the food and people. Wife does Not like Thai food, spices don't agree with her. Ordered fresh roll apps. Fresh, lettucy, a nice alternative to a salad. Tried the green papaya salad. I'm used to a sweeter  version, this just tasted sour to me.  Entree pineapple fried rice was underwhelming. Not much pineapple, or anything else delicious.  Satay chicken was ok, but dry, and unappetizing. Service was very friendly with nice young man. Place is clean and comfortable. Just didn't love the food."}
{"text":"Great Food...good portions  A great place for lunch Love their Thai Ice Tea  =) Prices are reasonable....clean place and great staff....very pleasant"}
{"text":"We found this place through all the great reviews & couldn't be happier.  The food is amazing! Beef waterfall salad, and panang are wonderful. Highly recommend both dishes."}
{"text":"Excellent food, enjoyed everything I ordered!!  The steamed veggies were super fresh and delicious.  Fresh rolls were excellent pad Thai was very good.  Will be back!  Online ordering worked very well, really like that option."}
{"text":"Solid choice for Thai food. I had Seafooid Tom Yum and I really enjoyed it.  My wife had Pad Thai and our son had Evil Noodles. All was good. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I had green curry w/tofu. I was good. Lunch time was not crowded. Menu had lots of choices. I will go bac"}
{"text":"my wife and I had drunken noodles panang beef!  Both were very good and we would recommend this place to anyone.  The customer service is amazing and it is kid friendly!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place and was delighted right away. From the outside it doesn't look like much (a lot of times the best places are that way.) The interior was adorable and very cozy. On a few of the walls were polaroid photographs regular customers.  The staff was really nice and patient. (Too many options!) When the food came I was, again, delighted. The chefs took time to plate the food in an pretty way. The food itself was WONDERFUL. I am totally coming back to this place!"}
