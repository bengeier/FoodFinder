{"text":"The food here is great, the surrounding is great too. The owner is friendly and so are the workers. It's a must try if you're in the area and they even do delivery!  I first tryed this Turkish kebab called \"Adana\" it's ground meat but the flavor of it was rich and juicy, it came with rice, salade, and fries. They also have pizzas, poutine, fries, etc. and the pizza is I would say top 5 in the saint-Leonard area!"}
{"text":"We are visiting Montreal this weekend and we wanted kebab. So this was the closest place to our hotel. It's now 10:55pm and we are so full! The portions are huge and staff is great. We have chicken doner dinner and paca soup first that was just lovely! We come back again!"}
{"text":"Came here upon a recommendation of a Turkish friend and only to try the Iskender kebab. This was something I'd never had before so wanted to find out what the whole fuss was about. I'm guessing it's a very popular kebab with Turkish people. The rest on their menu is all too familiar for me. Hence my little trip all the way there was justified lol.   The place itself is an OK place, casual, laid back and full of Turkish vibe. Big screen TV playing on moderate volume, you can hear all kinds of Turkish music. Not a bad place for a casual lunch or dinner in general.   My Iskender kebab gets a 4 star. I wasn't wowed and wasn't disappointed either. My friend warned me saying what you get here in terms of taste vs the one offered in Turkey, specifically in the city of Bursa.... big difference. Ah well, I'm not travelling to Turkey for that so going to settle with this.   Overall, I was satisfied with my dish, basically it's a mix of two kinds of meat, lamb and beef gyro style laid on top of bed of what looked like Afghan bread, cut into bite sizes topped with tasty tomato sauce. I think this is the only kebab you eat with plain yogurt and again I have to check online to see if this is the authentic way of doing it. Portion was good but $16 plus tax and tip which comes to $21 and change with no drink, I found it to be just a little overpriced. I'm guessing because it contains lamb meat.   It loses one star though for missing paper towel dispenser in the washroom, salt, pepper and napkins not found on every table and also staff not attentive. I wasn't even asked if I wanted to drink something nor offered a standard glass of water. Overall, I'd stop by here again if in the hood to try other food. Where I come from, they're all too similar to me but sure theirs has a different twist. Recommend? Yes. Worth the discovery."}
{"text":"Incredible food with amazing service. Would highly recommend this place. I've been to many Turkish restaurants and this by far is my favorite.  Try it for yourself and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent Turkish place, the real deal, the food is just like in Turkey. I have already been here twice and will come back again to try the rest of their menu. I have had so far the Iskender Kebab and the shish taouk kebab, very good. I have tried as well the lentil soup, yummy just like grandma's do it in Turkey. And their Kunefe was awesome, which is a dessert made with cheese pastry soaked in sweet, sugar-based syrup. The service is very good as well, they are very kind. The place itself is not great looking, not super charming but you still feel the warmth from Turkey. If you are around the neighborhood it is worth trying their food. By the way, their mixed platters are looking amazing, so I'm definitely going for that next time. They also mentioned me that soon they will open a new place that will look way better, so looking forward to that."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Turkish cuisine. The meat are cooked to perfection! The rice tastes phenomenal with the platter of beef, chicken and lamb. The price is very reasonable! Must try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Service is very slow, 30 minutes for 2 small sandwiches.  Very expensive, I paid 20 dollars including a 2 dollar tip and the taste is average.  I wouldn't repeat. I would pick any lebanese restaurant in the area over this one, They offer better taste, price and service."}
