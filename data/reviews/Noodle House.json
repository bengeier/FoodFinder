{"text":"Happened to stumble upon this little quaint restaurant. We ordered Pho and since they recently opened, the owner gave us an appetizer of mango salad, plus We also got a 15% off our bill. The service was great! Food came quickly and was tasty. We'll go back."}
{"text":"This is perhaps the closest pho restaurant to Port Credit. The place is nicely decorated and it's easy to get parking. The staff are friendly and the food comes out quickly. We tried pho, pad thai and a green curry - all delicious. This place is a really good find, the prices are reasonable and everything is fresh. I hope this place sticks around!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. We had friendly attentive service, food was fresh, place was clean.   If you need to satisfy a pho craving... Go here. Parking lot looks a bit ghetto but don't let it defer you."}
{"text":"Very good food for decent prices. The atmosphere is nice and peaceful too, don't be discouraged from the exterior. Although i wouldn't recommend ordering their shakes if u didn't being ur own straw because their straws are literally so thin, that ur drink will be undrinkable. We asked them for a thicker straw but they don't have. Kind of a joke if u ask me.."}
{"text":"The food was very fresh and quite tasty. The mango salad was very nice, but lacked heat. It could have used a Thai bird chili.  The Tom yum coconut chicken soup tasted okay but was a bit too sweet. It could have used more coconut milk as it was a little watery. It also had a lot of celery, which isn't traditional and didn't add anything to the flavour.  The vermicelli with beef and lemongrass was very nice although it also didn't need the celery.  The restaurant and washrooms were clean, bright and very pleasant.  The service was excellent and very friendly."}
