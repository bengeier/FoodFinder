{"text":"Fresh, fast and delicious. A great place to grab lunch downtown. Try their war won ton soup, it's great!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are great, but if the health department walked in, it would be shut down.   1. no hand washing 2. they store their food improperly 3. there are fly's all the time, flying around! (no matter what time of year) 4. they do not clean their dining room AT ALL. 5. They wash their dishes with JUST WATER, NO SOAP  Don't go if you want to get sick!"}
{"text":"Fresh Selects Deli is a delicious deli on the west side of downtown Calgary.  It is touted as a sandwich deli, but don't let that fool you.  There is mouth-watering Korean food on the menu that you do not want to miss.  Order the spicy chicken -- you won`t be sorry!

{"text":"A friend introduced me to this deli a few years ago and it has been a  favourite lunch spot ever since.  It doesn't hurt that it us just across the street but proximity is only worth a star at best.  The other 4 stars are all as a result of the food and service.  The service is always very friendly and if you go more than once you quickly become a regular and are remembered.  The food is fresh and hands down one of the best chicken club house sandwiches in town.  The chicken is roasted fresh daily and the bacon is extra crispy.  The restaurant itself is pretty non descript with a few tables and the kitchen area.  Honestly you aren't coming for the decor though, it's all about the food."}
