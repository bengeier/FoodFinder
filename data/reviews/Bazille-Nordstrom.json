{"text":"Don't let the idea that it's in a mall and in a big chain store, this place has GREAT service and food!!!!!!!! we will be back to try every menu item"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to have supper at Bazille for a work event. Our servers were fantastic because they were efficient but also entertaining. I love when someone enjoys their job. Makes a meal so much better.  Our table started by sharing the berry and shrimp/ cilantro salads. The portions sizes of were  more than enough for 3 people. They use such quality ingredients, and don't over do it with the dressing. The group of us agreed the salads alone would be a great meal.
Next up was the Magarita  and Panchetta/Pesto thin crust pizzas. Both were very simple but delicious.
For dessert, we shared the apple cobbler, white chocolate bread pudding, chocolate cake and creme brulee. Yes, that's a lot of dessert, but when someone else is taking care of the bill, why not?
They were all delicious with the exception of the chocolate cake. I found it a little dry and bland. The bread pudding wasnt typical either. It was very spongy and light, more of a cake consistency.
The best had to be the creme brulee. The lemon curd cuts into the heavy sweetness of the custard.
The menu at Bazille is small, but changes with the season. 
Cant wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Best soup and sandwich I've had this year! I could definitely  eat here everyday! Great staff,and awesome highball selection!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check out Nordstrom's Cafe and I'm glad I finally did! 
The overall experience was great! Our server was more than welcoming, personable and very accommodating. Having my three little nephews with us it was a challenge especially when their food did not come out in time. I think one of the cooks messed up their meal meaning they had to cook it again. The colouring books and little snacks our server provided helped prolong the kids in getting impatient. 
When we finally got our food I was impressed! The food was delicious and flavourful. Curious enough I had to try the kids' Mac n cheese and I have to say that I'm kind of disappointed. There was no flavour and the texture seemed to be under cook. By the time our bill came around we told our sever the kids meals were undercooked. Kindly enough he had them taken off our bill, since two of the three boys barely touched their meal.
I would've given a 5/5 if their kids meals were better in taste and in selection. 
But I will definitely come back to try more of their menu out! 

5/5 for excellent service! 
4/5 for food."}
{"text":"Came here with my mom before we started our Christmas shopping. It wasn't too busy when we arrived, but was about 3/4 full when we left. Our server was great. She was friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, and was very attentive. My mom got the traditional breakfast, and for $8.95, you get a pretty decent amount of food. She really enjoyed it, and said she would get it again. I got the croque-madame. I quite enjoyed my dish, and the egg was perfectly cooked, so it was nice and runny (just how I like my eggs!) The fries were also good, nicely seasoned. I love black pepper on fries, so I definitely liked that. I wasn't crazy about the kalamata olive aioli, it was a bit too salty for me. One thing we found is their coffee is GOOD. I'm a bit of a coffee snob from my many years working at a coffee shop, and their coffee is so smooth. You can buy the beans in their cafe downstairs, which is an added bonus. Overall, this is a lovely place, and I would absolutely come back. Definitely before it gets busy though, as it fills up by lunch time it seems."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time yesterday! I had the Bazille Burger and oh man it's like heaven on a plate. My server told me they grind their meat in house! I ordered my burger medium rare and it came out perfectly cooked. (And no I didn't share with any of the people I was with. I'm greedy!) Delicious balsamic roasted onions gives the burger a sweet/tangy crunch and goes perfectly with the peppercorn aioli. All of this on a soft brioche roll. I can easily see this being my favorite menu item. 
My server, who also happened to be a bartender, was so nice and knew the menu inside and out. He also suggested a few different cocktails for me to try and if I hadn't been on my lunch break I would have been alllll over them. I can't wait to try everything else on the menu. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love their Cafe and the restaurant as well. Have eaten twice and both times, it was more than I expected. The portions could be a little more but I guess fine dining has small portions. Try the burger, it's tasty."}
{"text":"Met as a group of 6 for dinner before heading off to see a movie.......great to be able to park underground  for both in bad weather ( which we never have in Calgary )..You can make reservations which normally might be a smart thing to do, however the Flames game seemed to have kept the hordes away from Chinook Centre for the evening.
The service is terrific, Nordstrom style, and our server JOSIE G was terrific......the service alone , and the relative quiet in the room, will bring you back to Bazille
Appetizers, soups, salads, entrees, deserts, beverages, .....all with enough choices to satisfy a diverse group without having you staring at a menu forever. 
The shrimp salad , burger, and flatiron steak landed on our table last night.......and the conversation stopped.....all were excellent.....plate wiped clean excellent......
If you like great food, and conversation without yelling during dinner, lunch or breakfast......along with great service.......visit Bazille at Nordstrom Calgary......"}
{"text":"Great tasty food from what seems like a from scratch kitchen. Nifty wine list..   try the King Estate Pinot Noir. Sitting at the bar and looking at the very nice industrial kitchen which looks well run/food harmony from the production team. A VERY surprise."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure of what to expect for this cafe. The reviews are great on Zomato but chowhounders say it's not so good. I had a great experience. I stopped by for lunch and was surprised at how busy the cafe was. Reservations are definitely recommended. The servers are friendly, pleasant and quick to serve. The food came out fairly quick and was quite tasty. It's definitely one of the better choices for restaurants in Chinook. The food tasted fresh and priced fair. I would definitely consider returning when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"A good food ending after shopping located on the second floor of the Nordstrom store. It was busy for a Friday dinner, we were greeted and seated quick. The service was friendly, knowledgeable of the menu, and attentive to the customers.

After ordering from the menu, we were given slices of baguette bread with olive oil and a variety of colored olives.

For starters, we ordered the Crab Bisque, and Peppered Steak Poutine. The crab bisque was a disappointment due to the fact that we cannot taste the crab flavor, but rather it was more sour than I was expecting. The seasoning is there, but it lacks the crab flavor I was anticipating. The peppered steak poutine overall was well seasoned, soft peppered steak bits, but it could use more gravy.

For the main meal, we got Roasted Salmon & Herbed Mushroom Risotto. The risotto was cooked just right with great seasoning, creamy with added soft texture from the cheese. It had a great synergy with the bitterness of herbs and earthy mushroom taste. The salmon on the other hand was bland and had no seasoning except for a lemon drizzle on top. It felt like the salmon was left out in the dish as the rest of the ingredients were well seasoned.

A side note to take is that the menu offers the number of calories per item menu for health conscience consumers which I think was a neat feature to add.

Overall, it was a good experience and I will come back again after shopping for good deals at the Chinook Mall. Perhaps I will try their desert menu."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favourite restaurants and now, I wouldn't eat here for free.

After we ordered our dishes I knew they had changed the Executive Chef. I asked the waitress and yep, they have a new EC.

It was over priced, less food and completely tasteless. We just left and I'm still hungry. One word of a lie - I would have enjoyed a Big Mac meal than what we had.

I will never return!"}
{"text":"Really good food and great service.  Beef short ribs were super tender and moist on a bed of bok choy and cabbage.  Hubby had a crab and avocado salad that was loaded with avocado.  Friend had kale salad that she totally enjoyed. We'll definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"** giving one star only for the girl who seated us (didn't receive her name), she was very kind and helpful ** 

Stay away if you can. Started eating here maybe a year ago, back then service and food were good but now the service is extremely bad, and the food is edible at best. We've had to deal with a lot coming here. From servers giving attitude (for no reason) to having two servers (Thea and Taylor) stare straight at us from the bar while laughing and pointing. One of the first bad experiences we've had was when I ordered water with mint. There was no comment on the fact that they \"apparently\" charge $2.50 for mint. The waitress (Taylor) never said a word. Fast forward to when the bill comes and I notice a $2.50 dollar charge stating \"tomatoes\" I asked what that was and Taylor finally decided to mention that there was a charge for mint (we literally got two sprig leaves of mint). Keep in mind we've been eating here for a long time and this is the first its ever been mentioned. I was baffled at this point and asked why that wasn't mentioned in the beginning, this is where Taylor started to get upset and gave a lot of attitude. After this incident we didn't come back for another two months, and today has been the last straw. After having both Taylor and Thea laugh at us while we're eating, we have now decided that we're never coming back. Won't be missing this place."}
{"text":"Tucked away in quiet part of Chinook Mall, this restaurant offers an atmosphere for both the casual drop in diner as well as the dressed up reservation only folks. The food menu is simple, uncluttered & everything I love for making an easy meal decision. Yet it still offers a wide range of choices. Our waitress was so great & attentive. 
Starter: We got crab bisque & NE clam chowder. Although I'm a big chowder fan, & this was quite tasty, the bisque was to die for!
Entree: Medi salmon & spiced pork chop were both excellent. Well seasoned, and good portions. 
Desert: The chocolate paradise cake we ordered was so rich & moist. The portion was good enough for 4 people. 

A must try next time you are in the neighbourhood.

{"text":"First off, j'aime Nordstrom so my review was already 3.5 stars there but it is that last 1.5 stars that is so hard for anyone to get. 

I was not sure what to expect at Bazille since when the Austin store opened at Barton Creek many years ago, it only had the e-bar which this Nordstrom has by the way on the lower level.

I was seated at the bar on the 2nd level, where the restaurant is located. I chose to sit close to the window and enjoy the sunshine day (Brady Bunch reference). You can, at least at the bar, enjoy college football on Saturday. 

They have a full day menu though some items might look pricey, based on the breakfast menu, the quality is tip notch!

While waiting for my traditional breakfast, I was treated to a nice bowl of pistachios. 

Now for my traditional breakfast, Eggs, bacon, and bread, oh my! Smoked bacon for which I got cooked southern style (super crunchy). Scrambled eggs and traditional bread instead of toast. Scrumptious.

Add to that, they have a full bar and I mean everything except Johnnie Walker Double Black (they currently only have Blue and Red).

I found out the Ginger Crusted Ahi Tuna Salad for $18.95 is the specialty, specifically created by Chef Noelle so I will be headed back for lunch later!

Now, for the service, being the Austinite, and also living there when that Nordstrom opened as previously stated, I was skeptical since I heard a rumour that many of the staff came from Moxies (and my experiences there were usually less than stellar). But to my surprise and uber delight, the service is most excellent. Friendly, efficient, and quick and genuine! Where were these people at Moxies?

Side note, depending on your seat at the bar, the kitchen can be a little distracting (noise) but it smells so good. 

For an opening weekend, this is the best way to start my Nordstrom shopping experience!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best sit-down dining option at Chinook and as others have mentioned, it can get busy. Luckily they take reservations so if you can, plan ahead. If not, at least they offer a texting service so you can browse Nordstroms while you wait for your table.

I've been here twice and both times were consistantly good, especially for their reasonable prices. The portions are surprisingly large so you can definitely get away with sharing if you aren't a big eater. My favourite menu item so far would have to be the Fresh Berry and Fig Salad. I like that it wasn't overly sweet and it had a good ratio of ingredients. I also really enjoyed the margherita pizza. 

One thing that is both a positive and a negative depending how you look at it is that they list the calories in each menu item. This can be a little shocking if you're wanting something hearty like the Prime Rib French Dip (1513 calories).

The service is also very good. My mom and I shared an appetizer and they brought it to us portioned out on two separate plates without us asking them to do that. It was really thoughtful. 

It seems like Bazille has become my go-to lunch stop when I'm shopping at Chinook!"}
{"text":"Located on the second floor, tucked away in Nordstrom, this restaurant is an oasis in the Chinook jungle. 

We had been shopping for several hours over dinner time and were famished. We managed to sneak in right at their last seating at 8:30. The sounds of a vacuum and cleaning diminished the ambiance, but the food that was delivered was really quite delicious. 

I ordered the warm Asian glazed chicken salad and my husband ordered the bistro club. My salad was not what Elaine Benes would categorize as a \"big salad\" but it was fresh and packed full of flavour. My husband's sandwich on the other hand was monstrous and was accompanied with a good size portion of deliciously seasoned fries. The mysterious cup of pink stuff that was on his plate was an olive mayo for the fries. 

The price point is par for an upscale bistro and we were both very satisfied with the food. But for the fact that we arrived only a half hour before closing, we were pleased with the service and will be return guests."}
{"text":"Bazille, or rather Nordstrom, has been on my place to visit for quite some time.  Nordstrom opened last year and I never got a chance to check out the store, although I've visited them in the U.S. many times.  So many pretty and fancy things in there... Anyways, I've heard pretty good things about their restaurant so I thought I should check them out.

Crisp Calamari - $10.50

I had wanted to try the tuna poke, but I only came back from Hawaii a few weeks ago and I know nothing will compare to the one over there so I decided to save the possible disappointment.  I quite liked the calamari here - it was small, tender pieces with a thin, crispy coating.  It wasn't too greasy either.  The only thing was I didn't like the sweet chili dip - I feel that something else less ordinary can be offered!

Sauteed Chicken and Angel Hair Pasta - $18.95

I really liked this.  The chicken breast was nicely pan fried and very tender and juicy, and the roasted garlic tomato sauce with the spinach and oyster mushrooms was so flavorful and tasted so healthy! The rosemary butter sauce with the pasta was also quite nice, although I'm not too sure why there's two different sauces on the plate as it was not necessary - I would've been happy with just the garlic tomato one.  I would order this again in a heartbeat.

I was definitely too full for dessert but I would try it next time I am there.  Service was good - my server gave adequate service but was not very engaging.  Prices are definitely very reasonable and the food was delicious.  Do come here and then buy something nice at Nordstrom afterwards!"}
{"text":"The very name Nordstrom elicits expectations. I had never been in a Nordstrom before so was happy to meet a friend there for Sunday lunch. The place was not very busy when I arrived at noon but filled up between 12:30 and 1 p.m. The menu has a nice very eclectic selection from classic French Onion to Kung Pao Brussel Sprouts and Korean BBQ Braised Beef so I'm not sure the French classification given in Yelp is the best one. You can find the full menu here: https://goo.gl/r1zGrV
On top of the regular menu there is a one-pager of daily specials. My companion selected the chicken wraps from the daily list and I had the Korean BBQ Braised Beef. We also shared the Kung Pao Brussel Sprouts. The food was decent and the prices on par with most higher end restaurants. I like that they give calorie count for all items on the regular menu and that they check with you as to whether you would like some bread while waiting for your main courses to arrive. I was watching the carbs so was not tempted and it is less food wastage.  Flavours were good but there was nothing really outstanding about the food. The chicken that came with the lettuce wraps was quite dry. I enjoyed the beef, it was melt-in-your-mouth tender. The charred pineapple kimchi, baby bok choy, pickled fresno chilis, toasted sesame seeds, cilantro balanced and complemented the beef well. I always understood kimchi to mean Korean pickled napa cabbage so found the cabbage wasn't pickled, the pineapple more like a dressing to raw napa, nice but not kimchi to me. Service was great but then it's in Nordstrom."}
{"text":"Went to Bazille for lunch on a Tuesday and was happy to see it was pretty busy for a weekday. We got seated right away despite not having any resos and anyone who was on the wait list was seated shortly after us. 

I ordered the Prime Rib French Dip and it was so delicious! The baguette was soft yet had the right amount of crunch and I think it was a Parmesan baguette. The prime rib was so tasty, tender and juicy. I was really impressed with the sandwich!! It came with fries and a kalamata olive aioli. I don't normally like olives but this aioli was so unique and I couldn't stop dipping. 

Overall a fantastic meal - service was great and all the food came out really fast. A great dining option to consider when you're at Chinook!"}
{"text":"I ate here.  Its the first of its kind in canada.  The pita&hummus was suprisingly good.  Sincere effort was made.  The ceasar salad was ok, and came with a fried piece of parmesian that I would have appreciated to be fried when i ordered it.  I had the flat iron steak, ordered it medium-well.  When it came it was well, but the fries and everything else tasted so great.  The arugala could have used some more seasoning or dressing.  I ate a few bites and when asked if it was ok, I did say that it was definitly not medium-well, and it was well done and the manager agreed with me.  He insisted on redo'ing it, and I was hungry I wanted to eat it, but I eventually relented if he just took the steak and left me the rest to eat.  The service was amazing.  The place has only been open a week so the meat station needs some time to get used to what they are cooking.

To my suprise they re-did the entire plate and brought it out.  The cut did vary quite a bit as flat-iron steaks do, and it was much thicker.  This time it was medium.  The manager checked on me again and definitly saw what it was and helped me in every way.  I had to leave though so I requested the bill.  I've never seen such an attention to quality control and care for customer satisfaction from a manager or wait staff.  I will definitly be back as I feel this restaurant is only going to get better and better with time."}
{"text":"Who do they think they are charging $8.25 for a 331 bottle of beer? 
Cesar salad tasted like fish."}
{"text":"Oh dear... where should I start? My experience here was a complete mess, so I'll write about it from start to finish:

I'm always willing to give new restaurants a try, and after reading a few positive reviews we decided to come here for lunch on a Sunday. We arrived and were informed that they were taking a waiting list, and that it would be around 20-25 minutes. No problem, we expected that given the hype around Nordstrom opening so recently so we put our name down and they said they would send us a text when the table was ready. Less than 10 minutes later we were seated by the hostess, and a few minutes later a waitress came by to take drink orders and give us menus. All was good up to here... but then things started to go downhill. Fast.

We ordered our shared appetizer and mains at the same time, but asked for the appetizer to come out first. We then waited. And waited. And waited some more. The waitress made no other appearance, or offer to refill drinks, etc. even though they had been empty for some time. We just didn't see her anywhere at all, and if we did, she walked right past the table without looking at us. Huh? We sat there scratching our heads, since she didn't seem all that busy...

After almost half an hour, we finally received our STONE COLD pita and hummus dish. We knew that it had been sitting around waiting to be brought to the table, which sucked even more because I was pretty unhappy about having to wait that long for such a simple dish, and was even ready to forgive the lengthy delay if the food was good. But it really wasn't. It tasted like generic hummus you could easily have bought at a grocery store that was \"fancied up\" with olives and spices. And cold bread. Yuck. After putting the plate down, the waitress disappeared so fast that I had to ask the next person who walked by (it may have been a bus boy) if I could please get a glass of water. I didn't dare ask for a coffee, fearing that it too would arrive cold and that I would have to wait for the next staff member to walk by so I could get some cream... 

But it gets better than this. After another half hour goes by, our mains finally make it out to the table and guess what? They're stone cold too! Big surprise! My partner ordered the Bazille Burger (medium) and I ordered the blue cheese & pear salad. Now, ladies and gentlemen, you might not believe it if I told you it was possible to mess up a salad... but it definitely is. Dear god. My dish was DROWNING in dressing. I couldn't taste anything else. Soggy lettuce and too much dressing = gross, no matter how many fancy cheeses you throw on top. And I didn't even get the short end of the stick, oh no... that was my boyfriend. The stone cold burger was completely overcooked and the fries were crunchy and dry. Yikes. We were sitting there for well over ten minutes before the waitress came back to ask us how the food was, and we told her straight up that it was cold- she apologized and quickly removed the dishes. The manager then came over and apologized profusely, and asked if we would like the dishes remade or if there was something else we would like instead. We said a remake would be fine and appreciated how promptly it was addressed. 

Now, I know that all new businesses have kinks to work out... I get it. Having a kitchen that flows smoothly and coordinating the wait staff and chefs takes time and practice. I was almost ready to forgive them, but then the food came out wrong. For the second time. My boyfriend's burger was rare (as in, bright pink and completely inedible) as well as being greasy. The fries were even worse than the first time around, which I didn't quite believe was possible. And the salad was still completely drowning in sauce even though I very politely asked for it to be served on the side. So... yeah. This restaurant has some big communication problems going on. 

By this time we'd had enough and just wanted to leave (having been incredibly patient and forgiving thus far), so we ate what we could and had to explain again when the waitress came over that the food wasn't good. I felt bad for her since it really wasn't her fault. She said that the manager would be taking care of the meals for today and expressed his regrets that we had such a poor experience, and hoped that next time would be better. That was their saving grace in this review, the professionalism of the manager (who obviously cares, but has a disfunctional staff) and the fact that thankfully, we didn't have to add insult to injury by paying for food we couldn't eat. Maybe we just caught them on an off-day or something, so take this with a grain of salt. I'm sure that a lot of people had great experiences here, but I wanted to put my story out there just as a general 

Sorry, Bazille, I'm all for second chaces but I don't think we'll be back again until the service and quality of food improves."}
{"text":"Food and drinks are on the expensive side but well worth it.  True professionals in charge of the kitchen.  Wild shrimp & asparagus risotto was absolutely amazing.  Calamari was a bit too dredged for my taste but excellent.  Burgers are great.  Service is attentive but not intrusive. Definitely will return with my group."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. This restaurant is clean, modern and a bit dark, lighting-wise. I've never seen this restaurant full.

The crab bisque is more like a tomato bisque as it's heavy on the tomato and there's barely any crab in it. I love tomato bisque so I'm fine with it. 

The crab cakes were not good - it tasted a bit weird and I would not recommed it. The salmon risotto entree was very delicious. I've had it twice and, while it was perfect the first time, the second time I had it, there was too mich goat cheese in the risotto (it was a bit sour) and it was a too salty so the restaurant doesn't seem to be consistent.  The chocolate cake for dessert is amazing. It's a good portion and has just the right amount of chocolate without being too sweet."}
{"text":"Went to Bazille for the second time last night. The first I went, I was just with my fiance, thought we'd try somewhere new after a day of shopping. We were extremely impressed the first time around, so when I was planning dinner after a movie with a large group of friends it only made sense to go back and introduce my friends to this gem! 

Very unique menu with some great options, definitely some higher end items you find in a quality kitchen. Both times I've been it hasn't been overly busy, I think it's still a bit of a secret :). First time we were a walk-in zero wait, this time we were a reso of a group of 10, very impressed they took the reso on short notice no problem! Zero wait and table available on time! Hostesses are very nice here, they are also very adequately staffed by the looks of it, servers don't seem overwhelmed and they have good support from co-workers with running plates and drinks, always happy to see this. 

I really like the unique menu here, good variety but not too big a selection where you'd be spending a long time decided what you want. Second time around I found it was a tad salty, we also weren't given the complementary bread and oil we had received the first time around. Not sure if they stopped giving this, but I think it may have been because we were a late reso and they were closing early because it was a holiday, so I didn't bother troubling them over it. Those were my only two knocks against it this time around. So first time was a 5/5, this time 4/5. So average 4.5/5 for both times. Definitely worth trying out!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and must still pleasantly surprise by how good the food taste and the presentation is excellent. 

Service was slow at first but finished strong for the rest of dinner. 

Burgers cooked like good ole USA (I still prefer well done). 

Portions are good and menu selection is good. 

The ambience overall is strangely made for groups, couples and yes even families and high chairs. 

No five star as restrooms not on site and on same floor opposite of Bazille about 3-4 minute walk in Norstrom. 

Overall will come back to try the pizza soon!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem. Outstanding service, reasonable prices and high quality tasty food and drinks. Love love love coming here...never disappointed."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and customer service!  

Ordered the Brussel Sprouts, Magherita Pizza, Crab Mac & Cheese and the Shrimp Linguine.  All very good especially the pizza and the Shrimp Linguine.  At the start of the meal, we were treated to warm bread with olive oil and 3 kinds of olives.  

Will be back!"}
{"text":"I had no clue there was a restaurant inside Nordstrom but it's upstairs: Bazille, a casual French restaurant, that rivals the likes of Earls/Joey's chains. 

We came on a Saturday afternoon around 3:15pm and there was plenty of room. We were given a couple options to sit at so we choose one of the communal high top tables. Bathrooms are located on the opposite side of the department store so you'll have to walk a minute or two to get there.

The menu interestingly shows you how much calories are in each dish. Wonder if this will become a trend soon. Main menu had starters, pizza, salad, vegetables, entrees and sandwiches. There was also a specials menu labelled as chef's fresh sheet.

Service was decent but the food came out slowly. It wasn't very busy so we were puzzled with the holdup. 

- Melon and goat cheese salad ($8.95) - Quintessential summer salad. Fruits were scooped in small ball sized shapes. Almond added a nice crunchy element. 
- Bistro club ($15.95) - came with a side of fries and kalamata olive aioli. The shoestring fries were really good. Same with the kalamata olive aioli. Nice combo.
They split our entree for us without us even asking, which was a nice touch. The club itself was a slightly fancier BLT. Good enough but nothing to blow your socks off.
- Halibut coconut curry ($30.95) - another  of their specials. I had a small bite. Fish was tender and curry coconut sauce was tasty. I think it was a pretty small portion for the price as my sister was still hungry after.
- Crisp calamari ($12.50)
- Mediterranean hummus ($9.95)

Overall, it's a decent spot when you consider it's a restaurant located inside a department store. Good if you need a bite to eat pre or post shopping."}
{"text":"I can call my experience here: Meh!
Maybe I was expecting more because of its affiliation with Nordstrom. 
But our burger and pizza were mediocre at best. 

If you are in Chinook, there are better options around you!"}
{"text":"Bustling, upscale and delish. Mind you my blood sugar was extremely low so I'm sure that I would've eaten a Big Mac. Actually, no, I wouldn't have; my body is a bloody temple. 
I wolfed down the Niçoise Salad with grilled Salmon. No word of a lie, it took me 7 minutes to eat it.  Every grape tomato was fresh and bursting with flavour.  The hard boiled eggs cooked to perfection; no dark ring around the yolk.  The lettuce crisp (spinach, romaine and red leaf with some endive).  Potatoes roasted delightfully.  Green beans al dente and fresh. Wait. Did I mention this salad was fresh???? Killer fresh. 
The salmon appeared to be wild based on the colour but I'm not sure.  It was still juicy and seasoned well. 

The ambience is a little noisy but the servers appear to be professional and the bar looks great.  

I did say that my blood sugar was low so the server kindly provided me with some bread so I wouldn't sweat and then pass out before ordering.  I'm sure it would've been a bit of a spectacle. 

Regarding the service;  it was prompt, and professional.  The server was polite, accommodating (obvi) and my salad was brought out by a capable and polite expediter. 

If you're at Chinook mall and want to check out some French cuisine, come here."}
{"text":"Great food. A little pricey but it's Nordstrom's. We had the brussel sprout appetizer and then the warm Asuan salad. Both were good."}
{"text":"Great Service, Nice Place and Good Food!

Reservation:
If you have kids and strollers, call and tell. My friend called and told them we would have kids with us, then they prepared a table with more space around for us to park our strollers!

But I suggest that just make reservation no matter when u go, it was packed with people when I went today (Thursday) during lunch hour.

Food:
The cup size Crab Bisque that I ordered had a really good portion and taste. 
Bisque is a high seasoned and concentrated soup; the one that I had here was concentrated, but not too salty. However, if I had too much, it would just end up being too salty for me. So that's prefect! 

I also ordered Ahi Tuna Poke! Very nice! I like the citrus flavour on the vegetables. The tuna was marinated very well! And I enjoyed having seasoned wontons wrappers here more than tortilla chips that restaurants usually provide!

But my friend told me the Bazille Club Sandwiches were just okay. 

And the food took longer than we expected  to come.

Service:
The manager and the server were nice and professional.
Thea, the server who helped us today was patient. And she has good memory; we requested for separate bill while she was cleaning up the table. She did not check, but she could tell us what we ordered!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the food.  But to start, we were delighted to see a menu at the main floor entrance to Nordstrom.  Kudos to Nordstrom for keeping alive the department store restaurant.

This isn't the blue plate special cafeteria style of yesteryear (Zellers).  This is a pretty nice, actually I'd say close to a fine dining experience you can get from a department store.

Our server was friendly and funny, often came over just to chat with us which we enjoyed because she was nice.  The food was fantastic.  The beef dip was excellent and rivaled any beef dip you can get in Calgary.  We also got a side of Brussels sprouts which were cooked to perfection.

The only thing that reduced Bazille to a 4-star was the lack of a separate washroom.  To go to the washroom you have to make the long trek down the escalators to the first floor and at the end of the store.  It is actually on the opposite side of Nordstrom, poor design planning in my opinion.  But that was the only problem I saw."}
{"text":"This place is great if you want to stop for a bite to eat during your shopping adventures. Despite it being located in one of the priciest department stores out there, Bazille isn't as expensive as you'd think and I'd say its on the same range as Joeys or Earls. I've come here on a couple of occasions and overall I haven't been disappointed. 

One neat thing about the menu is that they actually have the caloric value of each dish on the menu itself for those who are wanting to be conscious of how much they eat. Compared to some other menus I've seen, the caloric value is generally overall pretty low so you can indulge without being too hard on yourself afterwards. 

If you like French Onion soup as much as I do, trust me you don't want to pass this one up it is probably one of the best french onion soups I've had in a long time. Another favourite of mine is the Ginger Crusted Ahi Tuna salad. Super flavourful and it's the conveniently one of the lower calorie salads! Some of my girlfriends I've went with had the risotto and crab bisque which they both said was incredibly good. The calamari sadly fell short as I felt it might've been overcooked and the sweet chilli sauce had a very out-of-the-bottle taste. 

The service and atmosphere is great and gives off a very clean and polished look. The place is definitely one of my go-to's in the mall for some lunch."}
{"text":"I visited Bazille recently with a few friends and loved it! Service was great and I absolutely loved what I ordered. My friend seems to be a regular here and says most of their items are great so I will definitely be back to try out other options. For now, I recommend the Cilantro Lime Shrimp salad. The ingredients were very fresh and the flavours jived so well together. Yum!"}
{"text":"My friend suggested we eat here before our movie.  I'd seen it every time I've walked into Nordstrom, but assumed it was just a coffee shop.  As with many lessons in my life...NEVER ASSUME!  I had no idea that it was a restaurant with a full menu.  I ordered the grilled shrimp and asparagus risotto.  Although a little pricy, I usually can't resist risotto when its on the menu. The dish came with a good portion of shrimp that was seasoned and grilled to perfection.  Another perk is that Bazille lists the calories of each dish on the menu, which admittedly was one of my main reasons for ordering the shrimp risotto...it was one of the lower calorie entrées on the menu.  So if you're in the mall and you're not in the mood for the food court, Bazille is a nice option.  As I mentioned earlier, it's a little on the pricier side, so if you're on a budget, stick to ordering some of their salads or their flat breads/pizzas which are quite reasonable in price."}
