{"text":"Considering there's not a lot of places around town for some Indian curry and biryani I think this is a really nice place to go to. We were a group of 4 we ordered the Andhra ghost ghee roast,Andhra Pachi mirchi kodi vepudu, Amaravati pandu mirpa kodi kura,Rajahmundry spl ajanta kodi pulao and some roti .

The Andhra ghost ghee roast was the best of all as it was spicy for our Indian taste buds and was melting soft. I will be  going back to this place for this appetizer.

The andhra pachi mirchi kodi vepudu was really spicy even for us who eat a lot of spice generally. The chicken was soft enough but the taste was not reaching us over all that spice. 

The kodi kura was quite good with roti. The only problem was it was not fresh roti it was frozen I hope they have fresh roti's and phulka's soon . The Pulao was good but I wouldn't say a 5 star as it tasted more of mint flavour to it.  It could have been much better. 

 The only problem with the whole order was the quantity. I wish the quantity could be a little more for the price we pay."}
{"text":"Loved loved loved the food! The ghee roast was delicious. The green chilli pullav was yummilicious if you like spicy food. The chicken 65 Biryani was good. 

My only complaint would be the time to serve the food.... it took a while for the food to come everything came 7 to 10 minutes from each so we could not eat as a family. 

However, the server was very patient and friendly to talk to. 

I wish them all the best !!"}
{"text":"This is an interesting place. Their briyanis are on the opposite end of spectrums. We tried madurai chicken briyani, mutton ghee roast briyani and panner pulao Mutton ghee roast briyani was easily the best, the rice had so much flavor and the mutton was so tasty. All briyanis had good quantity for the price. Panner pulao was good, spicy and tasty but felt more like masala rice than a pulao. Madurai chicken briyani was a downer. It was more like a masala rice and too spicy. You cannot call that as madurai chicken briyani because I am from Tamil Nadu and it's not even remotely close to that. The other big downer was the wait time. Them being new they still haven't figured out a way to inform proper delivery time for take outs. Was told the order will be ready in 25 mins but took 70 mins and this was on a less crowded day. Also, I wish they had a basic briyani option because sometimes it is overwhelming when you try to order something but you need to go through their menu before you do so. Even with the wait and the chicken briyani I would still rate them as 4 because such was the taste of mutton ghee roast briyani. For sure I wanna try the other briyanis before changing my review. Also, we need more restaurants like this in and around Toronto for briyani lovers."}
