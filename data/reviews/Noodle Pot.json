{"text":"Terrible service period, since we don't speak taiwanese people that showed up after us got seated before us. They got their food before us, the place is dirty. We waited at our table for over 10 minutes before ever being acknowledged (I'm pretty sure it would have been longer if we didn't go up to the cashier trying to order), the table we had to run and claim ourselves. The yelp location of the place is completely wrong so a couple of u turns had to happen. Waited forever for the food after waiting a lifetime to even put our order in. While waiting watching more people who arrived after us get their food.  The food is not worth going through all the crap.   And the check was wrong."}
{"text":"Worst service I have never seen, bad environment as well!!!especially for the underbred old guy checker!"}
{"text":"That is the worse Chinese restaurant I ever go ! Food is ok , services really bad , there is no waiter out there , only one mid-age woman both do service and cashier !                   I went to eat dinner with my little one , I asked for high chair , the lady want me to bring by myself , that is awkward! There is no restaurant would do like that ! And she never smile to us ! No service at all ! I would not recommend it !"}
{"text":"best place in town for beef noodle soup, pass on the beef wrap beef was tough"}
{"text":"Kids wanted some boba tea, so we decided to drop by chinatown for breakfast and some boba. This morning we decided to eat at noodle pot while we waited for volcano tea to open. Food was great! I had the shrimp dumpling and pig feet noodle soup. But damnnn the service sucks from the time we walked in. The lady behind the counter look unhappy when we walked in, no greeting no smiling alwayse watching my kids as if they were gonna still some CHOPSTICKS and SPOON hahahah FORREALS!!! I dont know if the lady was having a bad day or not but there is NOOOO EXCUSE for that kinda service. Overall food is excellent but service ruin it all!! Won't be coming back forever haha. Im use to the typical subpar service at asian restaurant but not one like this."}
{"text":"Authentic Taiwanese noodle place. If you are looking for warm smooth food after all nighters of drinking of gambling, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Very slow service and unorganized, after being seated we waited over 15 minutes before we had to go to the cash register to try to order our food and only then did they acknowledge us and come to take our order. After they finally took our order we waited another 30 minutes for our food and during this time we saw 4 tables of 4 people sit down order and get their food. Food is good, but I will not be back due to the extremly poor customer service."}
{"text":"Food is very delish here, price is good,decent nice service and free wifi"}
{"text":"This place is so good! From service to the great taste of their food. I will be back for all my noodle craves the wonton in chili sauce looks simple but has great flavor. Beef stew and tendon is to die for...oh yummy, in my tummy"}
{"text":"I give it 5-Stars because it is authentic.  Lots of choices on a tasty menu.  Expect to be cramped when dining in, fans blowing, foreign TV with no subtitles on, and lots of weirdness to a westerner.  If you think this place is weird or different, in an offensive way, respect the authenticity and broaden your horizon.  The food is great!"}
{"text":"Just like the other reviews, a healthy alternative to pho!! Def good. Def cheap. The noodles are incredible!!"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 veggie noodle soups. Pretty good, lots of veggie.  Tomato noodle and majiang noodle are ok as well.  Marinated eggs and pinpan are good.  All dishes taste a bit sweet.  We give 3 stars bcoz we are very picky abt vegetarian food. It's really not bad here. Waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"Every time we go to Vegas, we always buy pastries and buns from Diamond Bakery.  Right next door is Noodle Pot, and I always peek in and want to try.  But I always had a full stomach.  This time, I finally got to try it!  Yaaayy!!!  Right off the plane (red eye flight), grougy, tired, and hungry, we had to kill time before picked up Aunty and Uncle and check into our hotel.  So we bought our buns from Diamond and waited till this place opened at 10am.    So we had the following:  Stewed Beef Soup Noodle - The beef noodle hit the spot!  Wow!  The taste is just so warm and satisfing.  The noodles are cooked just right - a little chewy and not over done.  Soup has flavor like I remember from Taiwan.  Also, has a little sour cabbage for  some BANG!  Beef Wrap - Almost like Peking Duck, but wrapped in a tortilla and uses beef instead.  It has the tortilla wrap, hoi sin sauce, egg, thin slices of beef, green onions, and chinese parsley.  We ordered this on the recommendations of yelpers.  Thought it was not bad, but nothing special.  Spicy Shrimp Won Tons - This was ok.  Imagine the shrimp won tons you get in won ton mein. Take out the noodles and the broth.  Put it on a bed of vegtables (bak choy) with oyster sauce and chilli sauce.  That's basically it.  Since I make won tons at home, this dish didn't raise my eyebrows.  Later in the trip, we came here again Aunty and Uncle.  We had to share our latest find, since last time in Vegas I took them to eat Taiwanese food, I failed.  If I failed this time, I would have to treat Uncle to our next trip to Vegas.  This time we ordered the following:  Stewed Beef Soup Noodle - A little spicier than last time, but since I can handle spicy, it was still really good!  Beef Wrap - Aunty and Uncle liked our leftovers when we picked them up after the first day, so we ordered it again.  Steamed Dumplings with Nappa Cabbage - I love dumplings!  Really good size, filling is really good!  Texture is not mushy, so yummy!  Put their homemade chilli sauce on the table, and tastes even better!  Steamed Shrimp Dumplings - I love more dumplings!  Inside has shrimp and chives, and other things that make it tase delicous!  Cooked to perfection.  Did I say I love dumplings?  So how did I do with Aunty and Uncle?  Let's say, that Uncle should pay for my trip back to Vegas!  Too bad I didn't make that bet with him!  I think they'll be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Dan Dan Noodles but was disappointed because I was expecting soup noodles since it was under the \"soup noodle\" category.  Their dumplings were okay.  My mother-in-law's soup noodles looked good.  My husband enjoyed his minced beef rice dish.  They also forgot about my husband's winter melon drink but they didn't charge us for it.  I was not happy with the service.  We were waiting to have our order taken but the waiter sat another party that had just walked in and he returned to take their order before us.  The food didn't take long to come out.  However, we waited too long for our check and so we went up to the cashier to try to pay but they were too busy so we had to wait at our table.  After a while, we went up again and and waited in front of the cashier to pay.  It is a tiny restaurant so it wasn't as if they didn't see us at our table.  This place is full of Asian tourists that come on the tour buses."}
{"text":"Vegetarian noodle soup=yummy!! I will definitely be coming back in winters months to enjoy this delicious soup. Ask for veggie broth cause it will come with chicken broth otherwise. First time and won't be my last!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come to Vegas, I have to stop by here at least once for beef noodle soup. It's that good. It beats the $14 bowl of beef noodle soup from Noodle Asia on the strip, but that doesn't say much... Anyway the beef is very flavorful, the noodles are chewy snd the soup is delicious. If you prefer spicier soup, just add the hot pepper sauce from the table. Not full after eating the first batch of noodles? Save some soup and ask for more nice chewy noodles! Service here is good, considering there's only one lady working the tables. She really tries to keep up with everyone."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in vegas. I started coming here after world noodle shut down and im glad i found it. The beef stew noodle is great and im in love with the bok choy"}
{"text":"We ordered to go food, beef noodle soup and enjoy at hotel. Just heat up by microwave,  our trip was more pleasant than ever."}
{"text":"Beef and tendon soup was outstanding. Very nice service. Clean. Great value. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great, family-like restaurant. Make sure you get the beef noodle soup with the wide noodles. :) Only 4 stars because of how loud it is here! Very cozy and sweet, though."}
{"text":"So this place would be comparable to those Taiwanese hole in the wall restaurants you would find if you are familiar with 626 in SoCal.  I stopped by for lunch and ordered the Zha Jiang Noodles.  This dish was very spicy, more than I expected.  The menu did have a chili pepper by the item, but I've never had Zha Jiang noodles that gave me the sweats.  Whoa buddy.  Besides that dish, I probably had the best beef rolls ever.  It was authentic style and they even added egg in it so it tasted like the Taiwanese breakfast Dan Bing.  Da Bomb yo!  Noodle pot taking it to the next Level baby! The only downside was it was really oily.  So you women prepare to start dabbing with your tissue.  I look forward to going back and trying the beef noodle that everyone is raving about."}
{"text":"It's this little hole in the wall in Vegas Chinatown, on the other side of the plaza from the Ranch 99 and next to the mini mall. Sort of a Taiwanese styled place so their food is prepared accordingly.     Their specialty beef noodle soup($7.50) here is really ridiculously good, on par if not better than the ones you'd find in LA. It's a perfect cure for whatever Vegas-induced ailments you may have come down with lol.   Cash only! But it's Vegas, you have cash, right? lol"}
{"text":"been here twice. first time was pretty okay, it's something that i would come back for if i dont know what to eat around vegas area.   second time, the beef noodle was very bad, on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the most delicious. I give it a 4.   the soup base was way too spicy, and noodle was very mushy.   I kindly told the store owner/ server that last time i came, the noodle didn't taste like this and was wondering what happened, I was just expecting a simple sorry, and we will make it better, or something like i can try to make it taste better right now. but no, he was like OH you came in at a very busy time, and we remake the soup and it's SUPPOSED TO TASTE A LITTLE DIFFERENT!   i swear the soup was too spicy for sake. i didn't even eat 1/5 of it. and Ima big time eat and I LOVE beef stew noodle, and it was that bad that I couldnt eat it.   the rest of the food were okay, but just the beef noodle was gross.  I'd like to just inform people that don't go in if they look busy, because the soup will just be too spicy, and it's supposed to be like that!   service was okay, a little slow during busy hours, but they're pretty nice, except for the part when they tried to make excuses for that noodle."}
{"text":"I LOVE beef stew noodle. When my friend told me this place made really good beef noodle stew, I just had to try it.  However; this place was aver.  I feel like a lot of places I review are just average.  Haha.  I got the Beef Stew Noodles for 7.99.  There's a spicy version and a not spicy version.  People who can handle spicy will want something stronger as the spicy one was just ok. They do have some spices that can be added to your soup.  My friend added the chili sauce to her soup base.  The soup is perfect for a cold winter's day.  I  Their customer service is just meh.  It's typical Asian service.  When we first ordered drinks, we asked for ice water.  Another lady came out and brought us hot tea.  :(  When the lady brought out our noodles, I would have liked if she told us what each one was.  Luckily two of of us ordered the same thing, so we could tell.    My friend did rave about this place, so maybe I expected too much.  I might go back and try the beef noodle dumplings she recommended.  I think it's dumplings in beef noodle stew."}
{"text":"Me and my girl love this place! There pickled cucumbers cold dish are the best in vegas!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup!!  Have had it spicy or not spicy, this is by far the best I've ever had.  One member of my party was from Taiwan and said that the quality of the food/soup rivaled that of Taipei.  To say the least, this place is \"legit.\"  Highly recommended, very cheap ($7.99 per bowl) and a very authentic feel.  Go here!"}
{"text":"Wow this place makes some awesome beef stew noodles.  My boyfriend and I liked it so much that we went here twice in 4 days.  The beef was cooked so that it was really tender and the soup is the perfect spiciness.  My boyfriend ordered the tendon and beef noodles and even the tendon was cooked so tender.  I wasn't a fan of the beef roll, but the pickled cucumber was delicious."}
{"text":"Food-wise, it's about a 3.5.  The beef noodle soup was pretty good.  The service was terrible.  Yes, I've been to tons of Chinese restaurants and in general, they're not known for their service.  But I've never been to a place where they refuse to make you something on the menu because they \"don't have time to make it\".  And I'm not talking about a Peking Duck that takes half a day to make; I'm talking about a fried egg, on the menu as a side.  Umm... ok what about the soy sauce egg?  It's on the menu too.  Nope, sold out of them.  20min later I go back into the restaurant to use the restroom and right there sitting in front of two other customers, are 2 big and tasty soy sauce eggs.  Wtf?!  Anyway, plenty of places to eat in  eggs Chinatown.  You're not missing anything if you don't eat here.  Oh, we also got beef rolls, and they were very average."}
{"text":"The beef noodle soup was decent especially for $8.99. Good for a late night dinner or snack. Had the triple delight which was cucumber, tofu and sea weed. It was more like 2.5 stars. Service was good."}
{"text":"I ordered the beef noodles. It was OK, just a little bit toooo salty...."}
{"text":"I almost missed this spot because I didn't see any English language sign but I am glad I persevered.  The server was helpful and of course I knew what I wanted beforehand.  The spicy beef with beef tendon was filled with fresh chewy homemade noodles and an earthy broth. I added additional chili sauce but it was spiced right for most palates. A nice change from the Strip."}
{"text":"Definitely the WORST restaurant experience I've EVER had!!! I really doubt the credibility of the reviews here. I've never rated any restaurant lower than 4-star before.  It is only a little restaurant with edible food and horrible service.   We got the seats really fast because there was no waiting line. And then we were served 40 minutes later! We did ask for the waiter and he kind of ignored us for a very long time. I couldn't believe that they served the group behind us! Then we got our food 30 minutes later than that. THEN! We got the wrong food.   Seriously, just don't risk your mood or vacation in this place!"}
{"text":"Noodle is awesome, generous portion. Small dishes appetizers. Dumplings are fresh, but tiny size."}
{"text":"I stopped by here yesterday morning 10mins after they opened.  There was a total of 6 customers sitting towards the back SE wall already eating.  My family of 4 walked in, stood there for a few minutes and when the lady didn't move from behind the counter or respond back when we said hello we decided we'll just sit ourselves in front by the cooler/window. She finally came out and hard-highhandedly tossed the menus across the table causing the condiments at the other end to knock over.  We just assumed that it was an accident but she didn't say anything, look at us, or even offer napkins to clean the mess of chili oil on the table.  Waited over 10mins for her to take our order, and in this time she had helped/chatted/served a new group of 4 super quick.  I went to the counter and waited for her to approach the register so I can order.  When she did, it was when the 1st group of 6 came up to pay.  She blew me off and reached pass me to grab his money.  As soon as they got their change back, she went straight to a new group of 2 that just sat down.    I guess she couldn't see my 200lbs stature or no one informed her that when running a business GREEN is the only color that matters."}
{"text":"Soup noodles of any sort make for a perfect recovery lunch after a hard night in Vegas, and Noodle Pot does an excellent job with their beef noodle soup.  Prices here are cheap, and the service is friendly and fast.  I ordered the #2 with beef and tendon.  The broth is ultra savory and flavorful, and the quantity of meat is very generous.  There's just the right amount of spiciness too.  The beef is super tendor and absorbs all the flavor of the broth, and the tendon is soft and tasty as well.  There's also plenty of bits of vegetables that lend just a bit of texture and crunch to the overall dish.  This is about as good as any beef noodle soup can be.  The beef roll is just okay.  It's got an egg wrap and cucumber inside which is a bit different, but overall it's fine, just not really great or anything.  The cold wontons in chili sauce was just fine too.  Not a bad side at all, but nothing amazing either.  If you're craving beef noodle soup, this is definitely an terrific option."}
{"text":"This place was decent. I didn't get the highly touted beef noodle soup but got the minced pork rice dish instead. It was pretty tasty but not the best I've ever had. It did come with a good bit of vegetables. We also got pig's ear which was really tasty, very chewy. The wontons were reallllllly good! I would recommend them. The only complaint is that I asked for a tea refill, it was acknowledged, but not forthcoming. At that point I was pretty thirsty so was sad that I did not get more tea but it's not a deal breaker for this place. Aside from the lack of tea refill, service was really friendly and seemed like a nice family owned business. My sister and brother in law seem to enjoy their beef noodle soup (clear broth, not the spicy one because they're wusses and can't eat anything spicy). Other patrons seemed to be heartily diving into spicy beef noodle dishes so I'm sure it's delicious. I might come back if I'm ever out in the Vegas area again."}
{"text":"Very hole in the wall place but don't let that scare you away. The place is pretty tiny but there was no wait for lunch on a Sunday. Ordered the beef noodle soup. I'm not a big fan of the tomato like broth so opted out of that by ordering no spice. Soup comes with tons of noodles, meat, bean sprouts, and onions. It was very delicious and big portions! Also ordered the wonton with chili oil. Pretty darn good! Definitely worth a visit!!"}
{"text":"Beef noodle soup is quite good and truly Taiwanese authentic! Many people around us ordered the same dish so it must say something about this restaurant.   Other dishes we sampled were pig ears and spicy wontons. I'd say they were decent but nothing memorable. The pig ears were too heavily drenched in spicy oil. The wontons were not filling enough if you treat it as an entree but as appetizer it's good size to share.   Also note, the beef noodle soup is large enough to split between 2 people. Otherwise it is an enormous portion so come hungry if you plan to eat it by yourself."}
{"text":"Love their beef noodle soup and beef rolls (with egg too!) Wish I had taken 5 orders to go. Also tried their brisket tofu and tripe (this was decent tho I wanted more tripe!) Pork chop rice- really big piece of meat! Good quantity but the noodle soup is better. We also asked for the dan dan noodle but they didn't have it so we were offered a different noodle dish with minced pork I think. This one was a bit sour (due to the vinegar) and I did not like it much.   Overall, a nice place to eat! and cheap!"}
{"text":"Dumpling with beef stew was delicious. We also had the scallion pancake and three delights. Cash payment for less than 20 dollars."}
{"text":"came here with some of the homies...i had the beef and tendon noodle soup...it was fiyah!! brought me back memories of when i was a kid watching jackie chan eating a big ol bowl of soup...my go to chinese noodle spot ayeeeee!!"}
{"text":"I was craving something hot and soupy that day so i decided to check this place out. I had the hong shao niu rou mian, beef noodle soup. I can say I wasn't disappointed. It wasn't the best I've ever had but it was pretty good. Noodles were pretty good and the broth was on point.   I've also heard good things about their beef rolls i will definitely try that next time"}
{"text":"Beef roll was pretty tasty, but was disappointed that the Wonton Noodle Soup by default came with thick flour noodles instead of thin egg noodles. I would've gave requested otherwise had I known.."}
{"text":"Its a Taiwanese noodle shop.  Pretty decent dumplings and pretty good wonton noodle soup.  Its similar to A&J's in Irvine.    Not much to say.  The food was ok.  Service was alright.  Its about 10 bucks a person including tip."}
{"text":"Best I have ever had!!! Loved it I wish we had one back in Texas!! Everything I had was amazing and it's very filling!! Great place"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Every time I come here they don't have certain items. The new one in Henderson is a lot better. I ordered the minced pork noodle and the spicy wonton.  Spicy wonton: 4 stars- chili sauce wonton with pork inside. Very good dish and not too spicy. Great flavors.  Minced pork noodle soup: 2 stars- let me explain the 2 stars. I was set on eating this dish which had tasty soup broth from the minced meat but for me it's all about the noodles. I had been to the other location in Henderson and the thick wide cut chewy noodles is what made the dish. Unfortunately they didn't have the wide chewy noodles so the dish was just not the same.   I've been to this location more than once and have not gotten the same sort of high quality I feel they have produced at their 2nd location."}
{"text":"This place is great! I ordered the #1 and it was super delicious. The broth was really tasty. It wasn't spicy enough in my opinion, it was barely spicy but the flavors really were delicious together. The noodles are good too, they don't seem to be instant noodles. The service is meh but it's a small place and they're packed. Food comes quick however. Definitely come here!"}
{"text":"We ordered the beef spicy noodle soup and wonton in chili sauce. The beef noodle soup was good, but a bit pricey at $9.50 for a small bowl. The wonton is very disappointing. There is  barely any fillings and the chili sauce was bland. I'll probably be back to try other noodle soups."}
{"text":"very bad service and give wrong items.i will. never come this restaurant anymore. dont come for your nice vocation.you will get mad"}
{"text":"Okay... I start by admitting that I'm no expert on Chinese food, but I have been around a bit. The food here is delicious and the service friendly and fast. Fancy it is not. But I don't mind that if the food is good. I had the won ton soup and dry minced pork with noodles. Both were full of complex flavors and seemed to be fresh and high quality. Total price with a nice tip was $15."}
{"text":"Hub is looking for noodle house after our long drive from az to vegas.. we suddenly saw this place and it's the only one open in that plaza (well, there's another resto on the other corner but all he wants was noodle).. I'm not that hungry and seeing the other customers food, their serving is big..  So we ordered a beef with noodle with spicy beef broth and a dumpling.. didn't really care about the dumpling but it was good! and their noodles.. all I can say is two thumbs up!  We would love to come back!"}
{"text":"Segui a sugestão do Yelp.  Pedi um prato que conheço e estava apenas razoável. Minced Pork Rice Noodle.  Obs: O chá quente oferecido não estava bom. Em dois aspectos: gosto ruim e copo de plastico."}
{"text":"Haven't had such tasteful noodles in a really long time. The beef noodle was extremely flavorful, maybe a tad too salty; But it was covered up by the spice! The spice might seem really intense but it was the right amount! The classic beef noodles costs $9 which is a little expensive but the taste makes up for it.   Be prepared for a wait to be seated!!! And it got so busy in the store where many people were standing around making the small dining area even smaller and I had conflicts with my neighboring table because of the confined space. Also, there were only two waitresses taking orders, serving food, and working the register... That was clearly not enough. I had to wait 5 minutes for a take out box!  But still, despite the wait and the cost, I had a really delicious bowl of Taiwanese beef noodles on this wintry day!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best beef noodle soup I've ever had...and I just got back from a two-month trip to China.  There's no compromise in between: Best broth, best noodle, and absolutely the most tender beef I've ever had.  It will leave you craving for more -- guaranteed!  The owner is from Nanjing from what I've gathered and he sure knows beef noodles!!!  Going back there again tonight.  The pig ear appetizer is a nice addition, too."}
{"text":"Many Las Vegans have declared that pursuing authentic Taiwanese food in this town is like finding a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. My ever-growing curiosity in this uniquely ethnic cuisine, as well as guidance from people who are knowledgeable about this food has led me to Noodle Pot. I can say, without a shadow of doubt, that this establishment has superseded  my expectations!  Following a brief stop at the Shavery, I ran into Will (a.k.a. the artist formerly known as SnowFlake), along with a couple of Yelper's, and we decided to go to Noodle Pot. I have driven past this joint many times without thinking twice to stop in. It was a startling revelation to learn that, according to Will, Noodle Pot has some truly legitimate  Taiwanese grub in Vegas. Most notably, I wanted to try the national dish of Taiwan, spicy beef noodle soup.  I admire extraordinary mom-and-pop, hole-in-the-wall resto's, and Noodle Pot fits the bill to a tee. The comfortable yet lively vibe keeps the interaction going. After the server sat us down, we ordered some appetizers along with the spicy beef noodle soup.  Cold Vegetable Appetizer Plate - The first time I ordered this it came with pickled cucumbers and other vegetables, and wheat gluten. The cucumbers were marvelous, with the correct amount of saltiness to harmonize with the sweetness used in the sauce. The wheat gluten was another smash hit. It tasted incredibly akin to a concoction of beef and chicken.   (Note: Coming here on a separate visit, and ordering this dish again, they had replaced the wheat gluten with soy sauce hard-boiled eggs. I notably did not enjoy them, and I was not too confident to which tree the egg grows on, but that's just me ((hehe)).  Pork and Chive Dumplings - Another sublime feature! The dumpling wrappers tasted hand made, and the filling inside was outstanding with perfectly tender pork matching the bright flavor of the chives. The vinegary soy sauce dip was the icing on the cake.  Beef Roll - My least favorite item, but pretty splendid nonetheless. Slices of beef and cilantro wrapped around a thin crepe. I actually prefer other Chinese versions that use a thicker, flakier scallion pancake in which the inside is coated with hoisin sauce. But, it was delish.  Spicy Beef Noodle Soup - the \"Pièce de résistance\" to our meal. We opted for the wide noodles instead of the regular noodles (think of it as thicker version of pappardelle). The noodles were perceived as if they were hand made and hand pulled, even though they probably came from a special noodle factory. The broth was nuts! It was packed with beef flavor, but exceptionally delicate. Hints of tomato added depth. Large portions of tender beef dotted the soup. Also, if the server has not brought out the chopped pickled cilantro, ask for it. That combined with the baby bok choy in the soup will give the dish a marvelous variation!  Many have mentioned this before, but I will proclaim it again. CASH ONLY!!! Save the plastic for the surgeon's table! :D  (Another side note: I took my brother here when he visited and at the time they had run out of beef so we opted for the Spicy Beef Tendon Soup. Even though I was fine, my brother returned home and had the hershey squirts for the next few days. The soup comes with a tremendous amount of tendons, so if you are not used to eating lots of offal or weird animal bits, I would be cautious when ordering this version)."}
{"text":"A mandatory gratuity fee of 15% is added to your bill for groups of 5 and more. For 15% tip, there was no service, food was just dumped onto our table, no greeting, took asking two different people for drinks, ladies here were incredibly rude."}
{"text":"Sumbling in to this place one late night, I have to say, I have become a fan. Pictures on the wall and friendly staff make ordering a breeze. Food might be a little strange if you are not open minded, but very yummy. The beef soup is spicy, but oh so good ... the beef roll is delicious - made with a tortilla, eggs, beef, and cilantro - the dry noodles may look like ... well, dog food, but tastes great!  To add to the authentic flavor of Noodle Pot, there is always a TV on a Chinese game show.  Open until 12 on weeknights, 2 on weekends, but these a hours vary based on ... well, if they feel like it - or someone has not messed up the broth.  Oh yeah, prices, simple and cheap."}
{"text":"My favorite place for noodles when I visit from the Bay Area. They are nice and authentic. It can get quite busy during lunch so watch your time."}
{"text":"worst place I ever been... should have Mc Donalds instead. don't bring your american friends."}
{"text":"Small but authentic Taiwanese beef noodle soups place with small appetizer dishes. Reasonable price. Recommend."}
{"text":"We ventured from the strip to Chinatown for lunch. We were glad we did. The six of us got a bowl of soup each and pork dumplings. The soup was 10/10. The dumplings were 7/10.   A ten minute cab drive from The Flamingo and you're there. There are many places to choose from, and we used Yelp to pick. We were very satisfied with our choice! Would recommend."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very average compared to what others available in Las Vegas. But before I rate and compare their foods to other similar restaurants, I like to point out one thing that is VERY UNPLEASANT. IF YOU ARE NOT A MANDARIN SPEAKING CHINESE, YOU ARE GOING TO GET SECOND RATE SERVICE. AND, THE SERVICE OVERALL IS BELOW AVERAGE FOR RESTAURANTS LIKE THIS TO START WITH. Sad to see this. We spoke English to the waitress and was seated. At least 4 groups came in after us. They ALL spoke Mandarin and were handed manus and served tea quickly. We waited and waved at the waitress to get attention. She brought us the menu and then the tea. The waitress then proceeded to take orders and served the foods to the 4 groups came in after us. Again, I waved for the waitress and she came and took my orders. CAME IN FIRST AND SERVED 5TH, NOT RIGHT !  The foods are pretty standard Taiwanese food and can be compared to other similar restaurants easily, like China Mama, Taiwan Deli, or the now closed Taiwan Kitchen, just to name a few. The beef roll was greasy, the jar jong mien was tasteless, the spicy beef was tough, and the beef brisket noodle was bland. It only deserve 2 stars and no more. Their location is in the Chinatown Plaza so it is a tourists trap. Locals beware."}
{"text":"Hey, not bad at all. The beef noodle soup is soulful and delicious.  Cash Only. No frills."}
{"text":"Gross! Would much rather have ramen or Pho. No favor whatsoever."}
{"text":"So good. Small, very authentic, no frills Chinese place. Every person was Asian so it must be good. Went on a weeknight late and it was still pretty busy. Although I was tempted by a dry noodle dish or some dumplings I couldn't pass on the beef noodle soup. Got a side of marinated cucumbers, tasty. Oily, spicy, just like in Taiwan.   The beef noodle was excellent. The broth is thick and meaty with a deep flavor. Beef is so soft and the noodles are perfect. They have the \"qui qui\" (no idea how to spell that from Chinese) but the perfect chewiness that is so important for a proper beef noodle soup.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is so tiny I almost forgot to yelp about it!  Yep, definitely a hole-in-the-wall, and a pretty good darn one at that!  I've only been here once while I was on my way to a performance, and I was a little skeptical.  The restaurants in Chinatown aren't the best, and there have been about three restaurants before this one in the same location.  But, Noodle Pot proved me wrong.  I only tried their beef noodle soup since it was recommended to me; it's a decent bowl of soup.  The portion is large for a really cheap price.  The beef is super tender.  They pretty much fall apart when you bite into it.  Also, the noodles are hand made.  Hand made noodles in Vegas?  I've never had hand made noodles, so I don't know what the standard is, but these noodles are wide and flat.  The edges are sort of splayed, so it looks like it was just pulled or something like that.  The edges are soft and when you bite, the experience is like eating al dente pasta.  It's a little crunchy in the middle.    The soup is standard beef noodle soup.  I like Champion's more because the base has a little more taste (salt) but the hand made noodles is probably the thing that's going to bring me back.  Make sure when you come here that you speak Mandarin/Taiwanese.  The place is owned by a couple that doesn't understand English, and the waitresses (who are their daughters, I think) speak a sort of broken English.  I definitely think it would've been easier for me to order if I spoke Mandarin, but the whole finger pointing works too."}
{"text":"Really nice staff. Beef noodle soup was def a winner. Tried some beef tendons as well, and loved em. The red sauce on the table compliments the soup perfectly. I'm not a huge soup fan but this place was a winner"}
{"text":"Everything is good. New business. Noodle is good,soup can be improved. Beef noodle recommend."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise - authentic Taiwanese noodle house in Vegas.  I had the wonton noodle, which was good.  Others in my party had the beef noodle, apparently their signature dish, and said it was Taiwan-quality good.    Well worth the short cab ride if you have a group to split the bill.  You may even come out ahead on cost, vs. eating on The Strip.  Just remember that in Vegas, the maximum a cab takes is 5 people.We had to take two cabs for our party of six, so the financials did not work out as well."}
{"text":"I ordered the beef tendon in noodle soup.  Absolutely delicious.  I would come back every time I go to Vegas."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in the dumplings and wontons because of reading other positive reviews on Yelp beforehand. They were soggy and bland tasting to me. It needed hot chili oil for some flavor. The cucumbers were okay, a nice portion for its price. The service was what you typically get at a Chinatown restaurant. I received no friendly greeting. A server simply walked up with a pen and paper, waiting for me to say what I wanted to eat. I had to flag them down to get the check after our meal. Overall, I wouldn't come back. There are better places to eat in Vegas."}
{"text":"A lil gem spot in Chinatown Las Vegas... beginning to fill up with people so early in the morning"}
{"text":"Very friendly place. When I first went in, I did not know it was a Taiwanese place until I saw Taiwanese TV shows being broadcasted on the LCD screen. We had the beef noodle and wontons with spicy sauce. I thought the food was OK, and the prices was average. But being Taiwanese myself, I found warm feeling about this place. I'll definitely come back, maybe even bring some friends from work."}
{"text":"I am going to keep this review simple and short. Food is average...more on the greasy side. Service is HORRIBLE. As I walked out I said \"the service is horrible here\" and a customer waiting for a table said I can tell."}
{"text":"In Vegas for a three day trip and decided to come here one night for some beef noodle soup. Really liked it and came the second night again! Friendly staff and the food was very delicious (I'm a big fan of Taiwanese food). The whole place has a really good Taiwanese food smell too! Definitely recommend for people who are in Las Vegas and are craving for some Taiwanese food."}
{"text":"This review is based sole on their beef noodle soup. I'm comparing their beef noodle soup to Din Tai Fung's in Arcadia (which is the best beef noodle soup I've ever had, thus far).   So, I've been to this place totaling 4 times now. I can say that their consistency of the Beef Noodle soup is a little off each time. The very first time, I was in love with it and then lately, it's seems like there's at least something missing. Even so, I still enjoy going here for their chewy noodles. Their portions are fairly huge and cheap too.   Beef Noodle Soup: Soup tasted fine and the noodles are chewy but the beef was tough.  I give it a 3 1/2 star for the lack of consistency.  Service is a 4, the server girl is attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Soo good. Another amazing hole in the wall find! I had their Beef noodle soup and the wontons in chili sauce. I love noodles, and I could eat these noodles all day. Their soup is prefect for a cold day. The wontons in chili sauce is soo good, not that spicy but just enough kick. Would definitely go the again, and again."}
{"text":"Min $20 for credit card use. Mediocre beef noodle soup. Only one size noodle available at 6pm. Waitress service is so-so. Just a regular noodle place."}
{"text":"The best beef noodle soup that we had so far in the US. We live in California but never thought that we had to come to Vegas to find the beef noodle soup that we've been looking for!"}
{"text":"So How did I find this place? Well my girlfriend and I wanted chinese food around 10pm, so i decided to drive to China town and Yelp what was nearby,. This is what came up.  I really wanted to like this place, I can get past that its basically a hole in the wall. A lot of these places are but the food wasnt that good here. We ordered the Beef noodle soup, it said that it would be spicy but it wasnt. It had a little flavor, but similar to pho it tasted strongly of cilantro. There wasn't a lot of beef, it was mostly fat and unchewable other pieces. The noodles we're good. If I just ordered this I'd prob give this place 3 stars.  We also ordered the Beef Stew Rice. For whatever reason It didn't register that we ordered Beef stew, We thought it would be beef fried rice. But it was what it said. Beef stew (which was just ok) served over white rice. It wasn't very good. I don't know if this is considered authentic Chinese or what, but it was just ok.   I have a feeling we should of ordered the dumplings. I will say the waitress was super nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Well, I was in Chinatown for some work and it was lunchtime, so I decided to have my lunch there. I saw a small Noodle Pot in Chinatown  plaza. This is a small location that serves a variety of noodles.  Gave it a try. Very disappointed(((   One of their BIG minuses is that they don't accept credit cards (only cash). After trying I can say that this is one of the worst Chinese restaurants I've ever been to. The service was really awful and slow. Nobody was smiling. The food was not good either. I had Spicy Beef Noodle Soup, that was not spicy at all and it was a little salty for my taste.  Will never come back again. Senseless waste of time and money."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place almost everytime im in town.  I'm in love with their beef noodle soup & beef rolls.  The menu is really small but the serving size is very generous.  Flavor is way better than anything lately that I've had in the SGV.  If you are visiting & home sick this place is a must try. They have interesting pictures on the wall of the customers but they always have their AC on full blast.  They also provide free wifi."}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas from the east coast and found this place. Absolutely delicious. I ordered the beef & tendon noodle soup, and I finished it in minutes. Would highly recommend this place. It opens until midnight but they start closing until 30 mins prior I believe."}
{"text":"The Beef Noodle Soup was really good. I don't eat beef anymore, so I'll be back there for the vegetarian soup."}
{"text":"CHEAP AND DELICIOUS.  My friend Christi and I came in for a catchup sesh and immediately placed our orders for lunch - she had the Beef & Tendon Noodle Soup while I opted for the Zha Jiang Mien (dry noodles with sliced cucumbers, bean sprouts, and spicy pork that you mix together). They offered hot tea, which is nice for a fast food place (I always thought hot tea was mandatory at Chinese places, but I've discovered more and more places are trying to get away with charging for it..pfft). We also ordered the chive dumplings.  Food came out quickly, and it was flavorful, tasty, and not overdone with salt.   Only reason why I'm knocking off a star is the service. It seemed rather mixed - there was an older lady who was brusque while a younger server's kindness offset that attitude.   Will be back! Solid noodle shop, but bring cash!"}
{"text":"Cheap food and hits the spot. The place was pretty basic and simple. We were just there for the noodles and noodles we got! We came out pretty late and there wasn't many people around which was great."}
{"text":"Our first time at noodle pot...waitress has no personality. Felt really awkward eating there since we were not Chinese or Korean. Worst service ever and never going there again. Food is not as good as it is rated. The egg was over cooked and hard...yuck!"}
{"text":"Seriously super good!  I a fan of chewy delicious noodles and this hit the spot. It was cheap and delicious a bit different in broth than I am used to, but on point!  Def a must try!"}
{"text":"This place here is seriously a hole in the wall Chinese and Taiwanese restaurant! They have the best authentic beef noodle soup you can find in Las Vegas. It's amazing. Also you can ask for a side of noodles for $1 if you're still hungry and have left over soup left.   Downside: cash only!"}
{"text":"Hello?! Yummy hot Taiwanese noodle soup?! Yes please! I had the soy sauce seaweed and it was so good. The texture wasn't as fresh or crunchy but it was tender and tasty. I had the spicy beef and tendon noodle soup, and the noodles were not the thin rice noodles. It was hot and filling and the ramen style noodles paired with the spicy rich flavor of the broth and soft tendons was just the right amount of everything. 2 bowls and the appetizer was just under $25 so this place is now one of my top fave noodle houses."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped in here on a Monday night. There weren't many in, and we were seated quickly. Very friendly waitress! She took very good care of our order, and recommended the beef noodle soup. The soup was fantastic! The broth was flavorful and rich, and the beef, despite having some parts that were difficult to bite through, was very good. We ordered some dumplings as well, which the cook came to let us know that they were out of, so it was deducted from our check, but they gave us some other dumplings instead. It was unexpected and pleasant.  I was a bit surprised to see hot tea in plastic drinking tumblers, but it was still good, and I've seen it done in a few other restaurants. Use your common sense and don't just grab the cup immediately if you ordered hot tea!  Definitely a good place for an evening meal, and I want to go back and see what their other menu items taste like."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food. I had the beef noodle soup and the chives pork dumplings. Everything was tasty and seasoned just right. The meat was tender and melted in your mouth. The place is small and the decor could be a lot better. It definitely had a hole in the wall feel."}
{"text":"To me this is a basic noodle place.  It was pretty good but nothing really stood out to me as being \"the best\" or a stand out dish. My noodle dish was pretty good though it has lots of coriander, which I hate.  My husband likes this place so I'm going to rate it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese ! So good I like the beef soup best. It can be challenging to find but once you do this little place never disappoints. I stick to the noodles as I haven't found too much love in my taste for their appetizers!"}
{"text":"After talking to Michael K about my previous negative and less than impressed experience here, we decided to come back so I could give it another try. Remembering that the chicken rice dishes here are trash I went with a beef tendon noodle soup, Mike went with beef noodle soup, and we shared an order of wontons in chili oil. Judging by the items ordered, I can say that this place is authentic, as their noodle soups are served simiarly to what you would find in Taiwan.  The beef tendon noodle soup ($8.99) was tasty, with a generous amount of tendon which is the best part! The broth itself was flavorful even though I asked them to make it less spicy for me. They have a spicy and non-spicy version of this dish by the way, so you can also get it mild. The noodles and tendon were soft, very tender and perfectly cooked. I would come back just for this soup alone.  The wontons in chili oil ($6.50) was also an impressive dish, and it too was served the traditional way. The chili oil gave the wontons a nice oily flavor but wasn't too overpowering or spicy by any means. The wontons were thin with a decent amount of pork wrapped inside.  The service here was a lot better than the last time around and our order was correct with no issues whatsoever. It was interesting that we were the only ones here at noon and then all of a sudden the place exploded and a huge rush of several different parties came in at the same time. This place is pretty solid for their authentic noodle soups, but that's all I would recommend here as an entree."}
{"text":"I keep hearing about amazing beef noodle soup from fellow yelpers. So decided before heatwave today get me nice bowl of noodle soup. I was NOT at all disappointed. I did get the spicy beef and tendon noodle soup. I enjoy spicy food! I know we all have our own levels of heat but felt spicy was just right not over the top but still feel the kick. The amount of beef and tendon took me surprise with generous portions. I am fan of Pho. I get tendon in my Pho never get enough one piece or two if lucky. Here at Noodle Pot get bang for your buck. The broth was so heavenly no need add nothing else plus had small bok choy pieces in too. The noodles was great! I thinking be more like Pho much thicker noodle close too udon but thiner. I felt made the soup even more hearty with the bigger noodles. Yummy. I also ordered beef roll just cause first trip wanted try as much as I can. Another great dish on the menu. It heavy for starter just so you know. It something that never had before maybe because of the whole restaurant style. It looks more like crepe roll up with thinly sliced of tongue (I think) and lot of other good stuff lot of herbs/greens. You get two nice big rolls pre order. I would take beef roll over any spring roll.   The service say can be hit or miss depending on busy. I happen too during the lunch rush so kind of happy found spot. They only have one server/cashier and she does everything. Although too be honest the cook brought out my noodle soup since it was busy. It came too getting the bill if busy best bet just go right up too the cashier. If had anything pick at was since busy waited long time for bill. Two other tables that they just went right up too pay since taking little bit. Overall service was still very good.   The restaurant is pretty small so timing is everything. I do believe they do take out orders. Parking more then ample being located in Chinatown. If fan of noodles Noodle Pot is some place that need too check out. I know will be back. =))"}
{"text":"Ok, this place seriously has the best wonton noodle soup we have ever tasted. Spring Mountain or also known as China Town of Las Vegas is filled with many Asian restaurants. Noodle Pot is located in one of the many plazas in Spring Mountain. It's approximately 10-15 minutes drive off the strip. Very convenient drive as there are many routes you can take to get here.  The restaurant is family owned so it is small but they have enough space to sit comfortably. They only have one size and it is large enough to feed two semi hungry people and fulfilling for one starving person. The max we waited for our food to come after we ordered was about 10-15 minutes so it is pretty fast.   We all ordered wonton noodle soup. You can pick which type of noodle you want in your soup. We ordered the flat noodle. I'm salivating as I write this review and sad that I don't have this place near by. I have nothing bad to say at all and all the good things could take ages to write. Since continuing to write about how good it is is making me yearn for it some more, I will end the review with, trust me, it is really that good!  Note: there is a bakery next door so after lunch or dinner you can grab some pastries and yummy pineapple bread to take back to your hotel. Perfect for after club snacks!"}
{"text":"Oh My God!  so bad... the noodles with beef stew that I ordered are so hard that I can't even chewing it. We Came all the way from Los Angeles to check out this restaurant that recommendation from friends, end up we are so disappointed. This restaurant is so overrated."}
{"text":"Where can I begin..... We wanted some authentic Chinese Noodle soup, so we went to China Town of course. Upon entering, we had high hopes, but as soon as the waitress opens her mouth, we know we came to the wrong place.  The older waitress was rude beyond belief, we  do speak Chinese, so communication wasn't an issue, but she kept on hurrying us when the restaurant wasn't that busy, and when my friend was choosing the small dishes in the fridge, she even said she's leaving if we can't make up our mind......... Now let's talk about the food.  I ordered the clear beef noodle soup, and when it arrived, it's Vietnamese Pho soup base with Chinese Beef Noodle soup ingredients, I have never tasted anything like it, and I hope I never will.  The soup base in all of our noodles are just too sweet from the msg, and the portions are not impressive either. I wonder how can they stay in business, maybe suckers like us out of town tourists was what kept them in business.  I will let all of our friends know to never visit the place again. And finally, they need to seriously hire or train their staffs to be nice to the customers, I don't care where they're from, basic service skill and attitude should be learned before working as waitresses."}
{"text":"The lady at the front is really rude. I've never been so upset. We ordered 7 orders of dumplings to-go (70 dumplings) they shortened us and only gave us 50 thinking we wouldn't count them. Not only did they gypped us, they were rude about it. They gave it to us, with it leaking all over the bag, and when we asked for an extra bag, she smacked her lips and gave us a dirty look.  I'm like what?? On top of that, they gave us 2 dipping sauce for \"SEVENTY\" dumplings when normally you'd get one for every 10.  I'm just really disappointed at the service.  Besides their horrible service, the food is really good.  Lol I enjoyed the food a lot. Wish we had what we ordered but yeah it was really good.  There's a nice waitress there, she's the younger one and she was super sweet to us and gave us extra sauce."}
{"text":"A nice place to have a quick bite. I liked the beef wrap. We also bought a bag of 50 pieces of frozen chive & pork dumplings for $26 plus tax. We were surprised to find out how tiny the dumplings were!"}
{"text":"I was craving noodles and decided to check this place out. The Noodle Pot is a small sit down place in Asia town specializing in more Taiwanese style of dishes. (I'm still trying my best to identify differences between Dishes with Chinese influence.)  I ordered the beef and tendon stew noodle bowel. Also, I believe this was the most popular dish on the menu. (Note: Read the menu carefully and you'll notice the differences between the dishes that look similar.) When served, eat immediately in order enjoy the initial heat of the dish. Don't forget to eat the tendon. It's full of flavor and looks like a piece of fat if you are new to eating this type of dish. There's baby bok choy cabbage in there and some pickles as well to balance all the meat and noodle in the dish. I also try the mini dumplings. Spicy and tasty if you need a side dish."}
{"text":"Well. I don't know how good the food is but the restaurant is suppose to close at midnight and we were there at 11:36pm and they told us they are closed, and the sign still says \"open\".  If they want to close at 11:30 then why don't they just say they close at 11:30 instead of midnight.   I would never come back to try the food."}
{"text":"Taiwanese food....  The place is small and the tables very close to each other. Service was ok seeing as that were busy. Packed with locals and Chinese tourists.. The beef tendon broth and noodles were good, the broth very tasty. Appetizers were good. Another place where you can try noodles served in a different way."}
{"text":"Pretty good, not great. Got spicy beef and tendon noodle soup. Was good. But beef could be more tender. Not too spicy. I'd come back again."}
{"text":"I just got back from Vegas and couldn't wait to review this hidden gem in Chinatown. Located in the same plaza as 99 Ranch market, Noodle Pot is a LIFESAVER for anyone craving Taiwanese comfort food.   Chilled cucumbers were a refreshing appetizer/side to beat the heat.   The spicy beef and tendon noodle soup was flavorful and had a nice kick to soothe my hangover from the night before. Would also be perfect when suffering from a cold or flu or allergies.   Wontons in chili oil were not spicy at all and a bit ugly to be honest but delicious nonetheless.   Boiled dumplings with shrimp beef and pork were not my fave. Will try the pork next time."}
{"text":"O.V.E.R.R.A.T.E.D. Had pork noodle and was so surprised by its low quality. The noodle is blank and ground pork has no flavor. Tofu/ bean curd cold dish is cold and tough. Very surprise how it gets such high rating."}
{"text":"Delicious Beef and Tendon Noodle soup. So hearty, perfectly balanced saltiness and sweetness. Large portions of beef and noodles."}
{"text":"We were looking for comfort food with flavor and this tiny spot looked inviting and it was open early.  So even though they only take cash, we wanted to give it a try.  We ordered the fish ball with noodle soup, pork ball with noodle soup, sesame noodle, vegetable noodle soup and all came out piping out and the broths were delish!  Such flavor and they even give you green vegetables in your soup.  The food was tasty and we enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Ate her a few times.  Noodles, dim sum and lo mein.  Lo Mein was my favorite.  Very good.  Take out was a great option for relaxing in our hotel room."}
{"text":"One of my favorite beef noodles and dumpling restaurant in Vegas! Been coming here for years. The quality is super consistent as an authentic Chinese restaurant. Space is limited and service is so so but its food is amazing and flavorful. Noodles and dumplings skins are handmade  and has an incredibly nice texture. Price is great for comfort food in Vegas, feels at home :)"}
{"text":"Friendly service, good beef noodle soup, and delicious beef roll!"}
{"text":"This place does not have an English signage out front so just look for a tiny noodle spot at the left of the Chinese mall downtown (if you are facing it).  Their food are a perfect cure for a hangover or a very cold day.  A perfect balance of fresh flavors and a little grease ;)  We had the beef noodle soup, wantons in chili, pork chop rice and pickled cucumbers and all were excellent.  They have good service too.  When we went, we were the only non-Taiwanese/Chinese people there.  Always a good sign."}
{"text":"I thought this place okay.  The Beef Roll was just average, not a big fan.  The side dishes were okay ... cold cucumber, sliced tofu.  I did however really like the wontons in red chili sauce."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food great value. Spicy beef noodle is where it is at! (Napa dumplings were great too!) Noodles tasted so fresh. I wondered if they were homemade. Broth was perfect. Not too salty and just spicy enough!  Btw, the portion was so big for the spicy beef noodle that one bowl is enough for two. We made the mistake of ordering two noodle bowls and had to take the leftovers home which we did so gladly. I couldn't wait to eat the leftovers... And even soggy and day old it was still delicious! Being of Taiwanese decent I was so pleasantly surprised that this was a Taiwan style noodle shop. Almost all the customers spoke Mandarin which must mean that they serve good authentic Taiwanese food. I hope I can take my Taiwanese relatives here next time they visit Vegas. I can't wait to go back! Now on my favorites list of Vegas. =)"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is amazing and authentic. The service is the typical \"Asian restaurant\" service so don't expect anything above and beyond. The prices are good and the spicy tendon soup keeps me craving more and more! Love love this place."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to eat! It is a gem not only because the food and service is amazing, but also because it is hidden in the southwest corner of the main two story arcade. Noodle Pot is on the first floor. I am telling you all this because I don't want you to miss the opportunity like we almost did!"}
{"text":"The Beef noodles were just what the Dr. ordered. This is a little whole in the wall so come hungry, but don't try to impress anyone with the ambiance. It's a kitchen and some tables. That's all."}
{"text":"I ordered #5, the sliced beef noodle soup, and was not disappointed! The beef was tender, there were tons of noodles, and the broth was great. Ambiance was underwhelming - almost nonexistent decorations, bright lights, and a loud fridge right next to the table, but the food made a good enough impression to make up for it!"}
{"text":"Really good for beef noodle.  Really quick to get the food as well.  It's small and cash only.  Good portion and usually bring leftovers home."}
{"text":"Best place I've come across for Taiwanese beef noodle soup in Vegas thus far.   Always a good sign when I walk into a Chinese restaurant and they assume I'm a native speaker right off the bat so I'm happy to play the role of the fobby young immigrant looking for an oasis of good eats in the desert reminding him of the motherland (or mother island, depending on your politics).    My two times here I've gotten the spicy beef noodle soup and the pork feet noodle soup, both leaving me satisfied with warm soup belly and no residual sense of being parched from excessive MSG/salt.    The noodles offered come in two varieties: thin (nice Q-Q quality with an udon like consistency) and the thick hand-cut variety that are like nice al-dente dumpling strips).  The broth for the beef noodle soup has good balance in spice from the star anise/peppercorns with a lingering sweet finish and the beef is braised fork-tender (chopstick tender?) with plenty of marbled fatty goodness and accompanying tendon pieces that have been cooked down to the perfect chewy consistency.  If you're feeling a bit more adventurous and need to save a few extra bucks, the pork feet noodle soup is a bargain considering it is 2 dollars cheaper than the beef noodle soup and is loaded with large cartilaginous hunks of the soup's namesake that are braised so that everything falls off the bones with minimal effort.  The broth has a nice mild sweetness and the accompanying bok choy provides a nice contrast in crunch/color.  Probably not the best soup to order if you're on a date or if an attractive customer is sitting in front of you since this is one of those dishes you just need to go to town gnawing away and discarding the small bones aside every few bites, so just be comfortable in your own world of pork-liciousness.    Lots of other taiwanese classics and small cold plates at the counter, so definitely planning a return trip in the near future.  Cash only!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best.  Plus they tried to over charge me.  Look at your bill carefully."}
{"text":"If I was only rating based on the  beef noodle stew (which comes in both normal and spicy variety), I would have definitely given this place 5 stars. Only reason I brought it down to four was because the cold dishes we ordered on the side were atrocious. It was so evidently clear that they sat in the fridge for ages that I preferred to leave them untouched.   The cold dishes came out all stuck together and packed together like an ice cube. It actually took the use of a fork to break it apart because chopsticks were too flimsy for the job. Buuuuuut, the beef noodle stew...  Ahhh the beef noodle stew is exquisite. The amount of spices and herbs they use make this extremely tasty. Get the spicy variety as you will not regret it. Huge, bold flavor packed into one bowl, if you are craving beef noodle stew this is the place to go. The store doesn't have a sign outside so look for a place with a Pig as it's mascot (pig from the story Journey to the West)."}
{"text":"I got the roasted beef noodle soup. The soup was spicy and savory, and there were generous chunks of beef and vegetables. The flavor is quite good; my only complaint is that the noodles are just plain ones, rather than hand-pulled noodles that are chewier and tastier.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Impressive noodle house. I love it.  I went two times this trip so far. If you like chinese beef noodle, you should try.  Its different than viet PHO.    Try their dishes too. Very good."}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent. I got the spicy beef noodle soup. The noodles are on the thicker side but I thought they were good. The broth was very tasty. It was very flavorful and a bit on the spicy side. I didn't eat the beef because the chunks were too large though. They also had bok Choy in the soup.   The chili wontons were okay. I thought the filling could have been improved and the sauce wasn't that memorable."}
{"text":"Came here after a terrible wait at Mothers Korean Grill. Overall it was good, considering that this is Las Vegas and not Los Angeles. We had the spicy beef noodle soup and the wonton noodle soup. The broth for both weren't too salty and had a good bit of flavor to them. The wontons were smaller than what I'm used to, but everything in LA comes supersized already. The beef rolls were wrapped in some sort of thin flour mixed with egg and was quite delicious. I also enjoyed the pork chop which was charred to perfection and has some good taste to it.   Overall, the experience was great with their speedy service, polite waitresses, and otherwise brutally long waits in the buffet lines. I'd come here again if I ever encounter long buffet lines!"}
{"text":"Best beef roll ever!!!  We are from the Bay Area where there are plenty of good Taiwanese restaurants.  This place is legit.  Food is good!  We came 3x during our 6 day stay! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This small mom-and-pop shop wins the award for good Taiwanese eats and solid beef noodle soup in LV.   Staff was exceptionally nice both times I ate here, but also keep in mind that Taiwan-style (and other Asian countries) is to let them know when you need something, not for them to come check on you.   Get the beef noodle soup with half tendon and half meat, just a little bit spicy. (I think it's #2.) Done well and finished with bok choy, cilantro, and a small bit of pickled vegetable. Only \"problem\" is that noodles come out exactly cooked and thereby end up slightly overdone by the time you reach the bottom of your bowl, but not sure how that's avoidable.   Seaweed and braised pork ear are both excellent here as well.   For those as bloody lost as I was while looking for this place, it's in the same complex as Volcano on the far right side, next door to the bakery. The English sign is SMALL!  Like all first generation Asian places, this place doesn't accept credit card unless you hit a min, which is $20 here. God forbid... Anyway, happy eating!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is really tiny and more of a cafe. The beef stew noodle is so perfect. Not too salty. Just enough beef, bok choy, and handmade noodles to satisfy any appetite. The pork chop noodle was also very good. It is a milder soup but the saltiness of the pork chop helps to balance it. The house-made chili gives everything the perfect kick and the burn pleasantly creeps up on you. The wontons in red sauce are also spectacular. I believe the red sauce has a vinegar base with hints of sweet and spicy. The restaurant is the perfect place to go during the winter."}
{"text":"I had to lower a star this time around. Want to know why? Because the day before yesterday I ordered the salty duck noodle soup and It was real good. Really good flavor, the meat was tough and with good flavor. But the one complaint that I had with the soup is a very serious one. The meat of the duck soup composed of the neck bone of the duck, and I couldn't enjoy eating it because I constantly had to spit them out and on top of that it was more bone/cartridge than meat.     But thats not my biggest concern is that those small neck bone pieces if not careful are a shocking hazard. I ignorantly shared half of the soup with my elderly mother and by some act of God none of those small neck bones feel into the soup when she was slurping it down. She could of shocked. To give you an image of how small and thick they were imagine it half the size of a small pebble stone. Or a piece of rice crispy cereal. I don't know if there duck soup always is composed of that part of the duck but if they continue to use just that part they will end up with a lawsuit by one of their customers."}
{"text":"beef noodle soup and the pork/veggie dumplings are just what the doctor ordered. this 1-2 punch of savory goodness is gonna make your face royal-flushed when the sweet sweet msg kicks in. almost missed my flight out of vegas cuz of this meal but it was still worf it. l'oreal.   the wifi password to this place is 12345678. is this real life?"}
{"text":"Noodle Pot is in China Town and the definition of a hole in the wall. But don't be fooled. This little Tawainese cafe packs a punch. I venture to the storefront with the pig as its logo at the recommendation of my Tawainese banker.  She should know.  And she scribbled in Chinese letters on a piece of scrap paper at the bank the words for Liver Soup with noodles and I dutifully presented that to the cashier at Noodle Pot.  Ten minutes later I was immersed in a beautiful tasting broth with that wonderful fresh liver taste. Yum. Four stars for me. In coming back to try more."}
{"text":"The food was great. Everything here is absolutely amazing. Chef John was so kind. If you ever come to Las Vegas, come to Noodle Pot"}
{"text":"This reminds me of a spot I ate at in Beijing called \"Hao Chi Bu Gui\"  which means Good and Cheap!  Basically it's good home cooking that won't break the bank -   Dumplings, soup dumplings, noodle soups, cold dishes, etc.   I'll warn u - if you have an MSG intolerance then stay away.  But MSG and cheap Chinese food are like peas and carrots.  Live a little wrong and get multiple refills of H20.  The dumplings were very good - not dry on the inside and had a nice moistness.  The soup dumpling aren't like China Mama or the \"Xiao Long Bao\" as you all know.  It's basically 8 big dumplings in a bowl of soup which definitely had the most MSG kick to it.   Last, the service was great.  We were asked how our food was multiple times.   The waitresses even made conversation with us -  This was probably because the mother/daughter team wanted to tag-team my Taiwanese friend - HoCash.   Nevertheless the food and service were awesome which is why I'll be back and i encourage Yelpers to check this place out.   *EDIT*   the last 3-4 times i've been here the beef roll has really dissapointed.  they have been undercooking it and the roll is not crisp.  It's china town so ask with caution but u may wanna ask them to crisp it up b/c it s definitely better this way.    the boiled dumplings are always yummy"}
{"text":"This is the go-to place for Taiwanese food when you visit Las Vegas. I've heard so many good things about this restaurant from local friends, such as reasonable price and authentic taste of Taiwanese food.  Beef roll was my favorite dish, both portion and taste were really good (without the beef roll I would only give 3 star to this restaurant).       ????Las Vegas???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"One of my fave noodle houses in Vegas! If you're looking to eat some noodle soup with lots of flavor and authentic cooking, this is the place to go.  Although #1 is the most popular, my fave dish is their wonton noodle soup. I always add the hot chili oil that is placed on every table. This tops it off nicely and adds the right amount of heat. For menu add ons, I like to order the Beef Roll, Triple Delight, or Marinated Eggs.  Don't let the name \"Noodle Pot\" deceive you! Their menu also has rice dishes. I have tried a few and they are pretty good.  At first, the restaurant looks a lil outdated and should be remodeled, but it makes the place look that much more authentic. It's an overlooked establishment because of this. Their only focus is serving good food. :]"}
{"text":"Woot woot!! So glad we found this place through yelp!   I didn't think there was a decent Chinese/Taiwanese place to eat in Vegas.  This place is located in Chinatown, I believe in the same plaza as the 99 Ranch Market. Restaurant is a little hard to find, it's tucked in a little corner. The place is pretty small too and of course, don't expect anything fancy. CASH ONLY!  The beef noodle soup was phenomenal.. I loved the noodles and the broth and the meat was pretty tender too, I drank the entire soup! Boyfriend said it was a bit too salty, but i still enjoyed it. The dry zha jiang mein was okay, but a bit too spicy for me. We also had the wonton with sauce and that was pretty good too.  Overall, I'd come back here for sure.. I'm over eating pho every time we go to Vegas. =)"}
{"text":"** AUTHENTIC TAIWANESE FOOD **  craving comes in when you are least expected..    so a quick drive away from the casinos and i found myself here at the 99 ranch plaza. I decided to check out this mama papa shop and was I surprised to find this very AUTHENTIC TAIWANESE restaurant.   now this restaurant is on my bookmark and I will visit it again when I return to Las Vegas."}

{"text":"My newest obsession! I almost don't want to write a review because I want to keep this little spot all to myself. Though the tiny obscure sign helps disguise the restaurant quite well hehe. Look for the small \"Noodle Pot\" oval next to a looming sign in Chinese.   This restaurant tastes like...home. I always thought my mother didn't cook any specialty dishes (sorry for hating in the past, mom) but now I realize that everything she made for us was traditional Taiwanese style dishes! Which is exactly what this restaurant sells. You MUST go with the spicy beef noodle soup! The soup is hearty and rich in beef flavor. It is also heavier on the tomato side which some beef noodle soup enthusiasts might not be accustomed to, though it's exactly how my grandma makes it. The noodles they use are perfectly chewy, slightly wavy and neither too thin or thick and the beef chunks are tender and savory. It comes with plenty of baby bok choy and pickled mustard and cilantro.   For the side dishes I would recommend anything marinated! The cucumbers are garlicky, crunchy and refreshing while the cabbage is deliciously sour and spicy. My mouth is starting to water right now. Another must order is the beef wrap which is a thin green onion egg pancake wrapped around marinated beef slices, cilantro, and what seems like oyster sauce.  BUT THAT'S NOT ALL! You definitely need to order the chili oil wontons too. And all their dumplings are made in house. And finally the green bean (sweet mung bean, not the string variety) drink to top it all off! Noodle Pot is Taiwanese comfort food perfection.  P.S. More waitresses please. That is all."}
{"text":"Yum definitely very authentic noodle soup place. We order the beef noodle soup and also beef noodle soup with skinny noodle. If you know love noodle this is definitely a good place to go for authentic Taiwanese noodle soup it's a bit crowded since it's very small space."}
{"text":"Ordered:  -Spicy beef noodle    The soup was very flavorful with lots of big pieces of tender beef. My friend was visiting from out of town and was looking for an authentic Chinese/Taiwanese restaurant and this place did not disappoint.  Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"On several different occasions that I have been here, grown Chinese businessmen will walk in and order the beef noodle soup. When in China, do as the chinaman does.   Come here for their spicy wontons, and their beef noodle soup. They have a very delicate and carefully simmered broth that is packed with enough flavor to blow up everyone's mouth. I have been here about three times. Their wontons are different shapes every time, some times big and some times not.   Always wait for the uncle to be around to order your beef noodle soup because he tops the soup noodles with all of the extras just right and food tastes better with him around. His wife just doesn't do it as well as him, although the broth is the same, but inconsistency after excellency cannot be tolerated.   Am I coming back? Of course! I'll be waiting for the uncle.  Side note: if you order their fruit tea, order a glass of water to dilute it, because it is so sweet, it's almost syrupy."}
{"text":"Best Taiwanese beef noodle soup outside of Taiwan IMO!!! I am sure there are better somewhere, but out of 100+ I have tired in US, this is simply the best for my taste.  Thank you noodle pot and I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I live in Henderson and have been searching for a legit Chinese/Taiwanese restaurant. This place definitely hits the spot!   My partner and I ordered the Spicy beef soup with stewed beef and tendon, fried pork chop with rice, and pork and chive dumplings. The soup was so flavorful and the pieces of meat and tendon were huge. The dumplings were very good especially since we love the strong taste of chives. Lastly, the pork chop dish was delicious; the pork was perfectly fried and came with all the typical sides (veggies and tea egg). The reason I gave this place a 4 was because my partner is Taiwanese and has high standards for fried pork chop dishes--we didn't like how it was served with the bone. Otherwise, everything tasted amazing!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best spicy beef noodle soup shops I've been to.  The broth is really good!  None of that soy sauce laden msg stuff.  Noodles are chewy.  Delicious!  Hits the spot.    The space is small but they were able to put tables together for our giant group of 16.  Service is really fast.  Cash only."}
{"text":"I love this place! Dishes I'm used to having. I don't think their noodles are handmade, but that's not a problem because I love the texture of it. They are usually very generous with the food they serve. Service is quick. Menu is easy to understand. Prices are very reasonable for being in Las Vegas. Always parking spaces available. Convenient location. Employees are relatively attentive and friendly. Some of the best Chinese noodle dishes I've ever had in America."}
{"text":"Asked for fried pork rice, the boiled egg came with few pieces of eggshells, the rice was not hot enough, my mom asked for their beef noodles, the soup was too salty. In addiction, the attitude of one of their staff was terrible."}
{"text":"This is a must have while visiting las Vegas. We always get the beef noodle soup and pork and cabbage dumplings. Amazing, authentic Taiwanese staples at minimal costs! 4 stars because service from one of the older waitresse is absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"Our first time eating Taiwanese food and I loved it.   Our dishes were delicious. This place is tiny and busy. The service was fast and the staff was polite and kind. Perfect for quick bites."}
{"text":"If you want authentic Chinese beef noodle soup, this is the place to go. I ordered the regular beef noodle soup with wide noodles. I've been here a couple times and both regular and wide noodles are fresh and delicious. Definitely recommend this place for noodles!:)"}
{"text":"I was given a glowing recommendation of this place because of their beef noodle soup, but sadly it was a let down. I appreciate the local joint's attempt, and the price is good, but the soup was too sweet for the style they were selling."}
{"text":"I have a weakness and it is NOODLES!  Even the scorching hot sun could not keep me away from a hot bowl of noodle soup.  Open late and tucked into the Chinatown plaza, I knew I had to go take a visit.  AMBIENCE: This is a great place if Pho Kim Long down the way is too full.  This is not a fancy shmancy restaurant, but it's a great spot to get a quick fill of your noodle cravings and go.  They also seem to store their meats in the fridge in the dining area, which is a little strange, but nonetheless entertaining to see all the different kinds of meat they have stocked in there when they go to pull something out.  FOOD QUALITY: The noodle soup was delicious!!! I got the Wonton noodles and the broth was just perfect!  The wonton was tender and tasty and the noodles were melt in your mouth yummy!  The portion was also generous enough to satisfy my tummy.  Price was cheap too - I don't believe any of the noodles came out to be more than $8.    OVERALL: The noodles were so yummy, I would definitely put this place on the list to come back to for my next Vegas visit.  Plus, I now have another alternative if Pho Kim Long's line ever gets too long."}
{"text":"This is the worse beef noodle soup I ever had, absolutely disgusting, beef soup smells like pork... really make me sick... never wanna come back again"}
{"text":"I'm not one to drink my noodle soup, but how can you resist? Especially on a cold and windy night. Get the #1 and after drinking the soup, you'll have a nice and warm feeling in the pit of your stomach."}
{"text":"Found this cozy little noodle shop while walking around looking for a decent (tasty but not too pricey) in this Chinatown plaza. I am a sucker for a good beef noodle soup, especially with thick chewy noodles, so that's three stars straight up ;) The noodles are hand-pulled and as a result are super long (think Rapunzel's hair) - like the whole bowl consists of about four noodle strands - and cooked just a little overdone, as they're a tad on the soggy side. But the broth is delicious, if a bit salty, with a generous helping of green onion and tender greens.  Then, we found out you could order more portions of noodles to put into your bowl for just $1 more. So good and so filling! My sister and I ate three portions and nearly had to be rolled out of the place. What a steal.  We also ordered their pork chop noodle soup - their regular thin noodles are just okay, also kind of soft - as well as pork chop rice and pig ears. All were tasty, with good breading on the pork chops, but definitely on the salty side. I drank copious amounts of water but had to flag down the waiters even when there was just one other group in the place. But it was almost 3pm when I was there so the older grandpas and grandmas that cook here were sitting down for a meal, but they jumped up when they found out we girls could eat. ha.  I'm definitely coming back here when I want a change from the buffets next time I'm in Vegas. They also offer free wifi but you have to ask for the password... and open till midnight every day and 2am on weekends? NICE. Noodles for all!"}
{"text":"CAUTION!!! the owner/waitress just stole my jacket. I was sitting in this restaurant this afternoon, there was no other customers but us. At the end we decided to change to another place. I left my jacket on the chair. After 10 min, I noticed and returned to the restaurant asking for my jacket.  The owner LIED saying I never brought a jacket in. No one else was there except her. Very sad lost my Jacket and met a terrible owner. Will NEVER go there AGAIN."}
{"text":"Warm, comforting and delicious. That is how I feel about Noodle Pot.  My boyfriend was the one to turn me on to this little joint. We were looking for Chinese food originally, but he walked inside, just to take a peek. When he came back out, he was like, \"Oh yeah. This looks good.\"  No doubt, he was spot on. I was a little bit skeptical at first, seeing that their mascot is some weird-looking pig, who is standing on his hind legs and holding a chicken drumstick in his hand. WEIRD. I giggled incessantly, but still decided to give it a chance.  Man, when the flavor of the soup broth hits you... Wow. It looks watery, but as soon as you sip a little bit (yes, just a teeny-tiny bit, because the soup is served the same temperature as the surface of the sun), it \"whams\" you in the mouth with a meaty punch.   I usually get the beef stew soup, but the man always gets either Beef and Tendon, or just the Tendon. I have been about four or five times now, and the consistency is always the same. Lots of tendon/beef, lots of flavor.   For all you Pho fans out there, it's a nice break from the norm, especially is you are looking for something a little hardier and meatier. This is gonna be an absolute staple place for me this coming winter.  PS- If you are lucky (like I was, one fateful evening), you might even run into the Duchess herself, Yuhi K. dining here!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to noodle spot for Taiwanese beef noodle soup in Vegas. The broth has really flavorful and the meat / tendon is very tender. It's a  no frills restaurant, so don't expect great service or extensive menu. It is basically noodle soup, noodles and dumplings. Very basic but they are good at what they do."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, first time got the wonton soup, which was pretty decent. Nothing too special or fancy though we did have a question of if they were using the microwave to heat food up. We're still not sure!  The second time, I got the beef noodle soup (I think that's what it was called, it was the first one on the menu), got it spicy and with thick noodles! It was pretty good, the noodles were cooked just right (at least for me), it wasn't too spicy just enough to taste it, and the beef was very tender (it came apart very easily!). I believe it was $7.99 for that. My friend got the beef and tendon, spicy, and with thick noodles as well. I believe he liked it as well. Well it wasn't bad for either of us, so that's a plus.  It's worth a try, I still need to try some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Definitely worth a try! My hubby got the beef noodle soup, I got Porkchop with rice, and we shared the hot oil wonton. Pork chop dish was ok, wasn't deep fried (which was good) but it wasn't thoroughly cooked, had some pink which I did not like. Beef noodle soup was great, just as good as Beijing Noodle (maybe even a tad bit better, cuz this soup was spicier). Hot oil chili was good but wasn't spicy enough. Price was great! Very affordable!"}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Vegas, I must stop by noodle pot for the beef noodle soup. I think this is my favorite beef noodle soup in the United States. The broth isn't too oily, the meat is super tender and flavorful (melts in your mouth almost), and the broth tastes like it's been simmering for days. Their dumplings are pretty delicious as well. See you again next time I'm in Vegas, noodle pot!"}
{"text":"After I finally persuaded Earl to come here for a late lunch, we got to visit Noodle Pot.  Earl hesitated to come here because we had a 7 course chef tasting dinner planned at 6pm, and it is already 2pm.    When we arrived, we were promptly greeted by the staff and was seated.  Choice between hot tea and water was offered, we opted for hot tea.  We ordered the two most talked about items on Yelp.  While we were waiting, Earl was intrigued by the Taiwanese variety show that was playing on the TV.  I, on the other hand, was intrigued with the big freezer that located inside the dining area, packed with frozen meat and trays of handmade wontons.   Onto the food:  -Beef and Tendon Noodle Soup:  We asked for extra bowls so we can share this.  This is a huge bowl of spicy flavorful broth with super tender chunks of beef and tendons.  There were also baby bok choy and pickled veggie in this bowl of goodness.    -Beef roll: tender slices of beef, egg and tons and tons of cilantro, with hoisin sauce, rolled up with a mu shu like wrapper.  There were two rolls, sliced in three sections, that came in an order.  We each had a section and took home the rest because we want to save room for dinner.  We had it for breakfast this morning and it was still delicious.  Service was awesome. Food we had was awesome. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I loved this hole in the wall, literally its so small.  The noodle bowls were great as well as the dim sum. Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm making this one of my mandatory pit stops."}
{"text":"Thumbs up for the hand cut noodle.  Their regular noodle is also very good compare to all the other noodle soup places.  Their menu is not big but made me want to try everything on it.  The place is almost like an hole in the wall Chinese place.  It's small, simple and comfortable for  a noodle shop.  It's more in the northern Chinese food category compare to all the other cantonese places.    Beef noodle soup:  I love the texture of the noodle.  Beef cubes are tasty and tender (traditional way to make beef in Northern China).  I love the cabbage and the other veggies in it.  The only thing I don't like is that the broth is salty.    I will go back and try their other dishes such as dan dan noodle, Ja jiang mien, dumplings and so on."}
{"text":"I frequent this place about once a week to get my fill on Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup. It's the best I've ever had, though I am no \"expert\" on authentic taste. However, my friends who are much more in tune with the traditional flavor say that it is *very* good. This is primarily the dish I stick with, as it is their primary specialty, I believe.  Their beef, as compared to most places I've had in California, is tender, quality meat. A&J, a semi-chain, has these comparatively cheap pieces of beef with fat layered into it. I know which I prefer. The soup is very good, as are the noodles, and at 8 dollars a dish, you really can't go wrong as the meal is also very filling.  I've also enjoyed the beef rolls here - essentially sliced beef with some hoisin style sauce and a lot of cilantro-type herbs and egg wrapped into a thin pancake. They're really tasty as well.  Additionally, I do find that the owners and workers here are better than most hole-in-the-wall Taiwanese restaurants. Sometimes I could simply not stand the way I was treated at places like A&J.  A couple tips. CASH ONLY, and they often close before the listed closing time if they are not busy at all. Like potentially two hours early, so either call or be prepared to go early!"}
{"text":"This is my #1 spot for beef noodle soup (niu rou mien) in Las Vegas. While it isn't Taiwan, this comes pretty dang close. The broth of the beef noodle soup has a very strong tomato flavor, just how I like it. Expect a kick from the broth as well. Noodles are spongy and plentiful. We were one of three parties in the restaurant and service was very hospitable and welcoming. Prices are a little high-my normal order of tendon beef noodle soup costs $10.99. Minimum charge for credit cards is $20."}
{"text":"good quick beef noodle soup that hits the spot fairly well."}
{"text":"I came with my family to try Taiwanese noodles. It's nice to have somebody that speaks their language as well. I ordered the number five beef with noodles and it was very good the soup base was very delicious.  I also ordered the beef roll which I shouldn't have nothing was huge and really good but even with four of us we still left two pieces behind."}
{"text":"Sooo yuuumy.  Have to order the simmer fried beef and tendon noodle soup.  So yuuuummmyyyy. So gooood. It feels like real taiwanese food vendor shop."}
{"text":"RUDE, BUSY & NO CLASS.   We ordered:   1.) Ground pork over rice - SALTY 2.) Pork chop rice - SALTY 3.) The beef tendon noodle soup - Average  The Problems?   I gave them the benefit of the doubt despite their lower ratings. (Big Mistake) Typical lower end restaurant where they just want your money, and rush you out to get the next group in.   We didn't even finish and she started cleaning our table!!!  She asked if we were done eating, and right when we were about to say \"No\" She quickly started cleaning out table.   Then we told her we weren't done eating. She said: \"Why didn't you tell me earlier\", and stormed off.   THEN, we got the bill. We only had 5 people in our group, but they charged us the extra 15% tip for having \"6\" people.  WE ONLY HAD 5 PEOPLE !!  TERRIBLE!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch around 1-2pm it was packed. It's small cozy and hole in the wall. When I entered the place I wasn't greeted or acknowledged. After the cleared some tables the waiter/cashier ask who many people. I was seated right away. They brought me hot tea. I ordered the won ton red oil sauce and crispy chicken leg rice plate. The won tons came it was great. Then my entree came next that was delicious. It was basically  chicken, vegetables, eggs and rice. That filled me up! Also it's a big serving which I love! They never came and ask how the food taste or refill the drinks. Overall food was good but they can improve on the costumer service."}
{"text":"Noodle Pot is famous for their beef noodle soup and it does NOT dissapoint!  The broth is so savory, flavorful, and frangrant, the noodles and bokchoy are plentiful...  Can it get any better?  I don't think so! The chunks of beef and tendon are cooked tender and the portions are very generous.  It's money well spent!  Fried Pork chop?  Nothing fancy but delicious nonetheless.  It's lightly fried and had the perfect chinese marinades going on.  Loved it.  Beef rolls?  Amazing too.  The crepes were egg-y and light and the sweet hoisin sauce, tender beef, and crispy cucumbers was perfect-o.  Would I come back here?  HECK YA!"}
{"text":"They are sooooo rude only at night we always make the order easy to understand but they still don't understand. Another group of couple of walk in and got the same bad  service and we notice the server will talk to other customers with a different language and laugh until we ask for assistance she rolled her eyes I'm not trying to put the race card but that's how we felt  we just all got up and left we came on 5/29/18 at 9:16pm who was working that shift she was super rude"}
{"text":"Stopped here on my vacation.  Had some dumplings I couldn't pronounce, and some beef stew.  It was amazing.  The staff was great, comfortable ambiance, and mostly, the amazing food.  I wish I could tell you what I ate and recommend it, but I don't k ow what it was called.  All I know is if you can stop by here, you won't regret it.  So. Darn. Good."}
{"text":"A great hole in the wall restaurant in Chinatown. Don't expect a modern and fancy establishment just a small family owned and operated placed that is delicious. Taiwanese style soup great for cold days and nights. Personal favorite is their Wonton Noodle Soup and Beef Roll. Another option if your in the mood to have Asian style soup oppose to Vietnamese Pho. However this place can get very busy with tourist and locals because of its popularity but the turnover is pretty quick."}
{"text":"Last time we were here, we ate here three time in a row. This time is no exception. Very good beef noodle soup and dumplings. I think they hand pulled their noodles. If you come during busy hours, you will have to wait in line."}
{"text":"The customer service was great, but we wanted Beef Stew over rice instead of Minced Pork over rice and they said they didn't have rice. WTF right?  That was a simple order but they didn't get it.  The food was okay.  I had the Beef Stew Soup Noodle.  It was not what I expected.  I expected it to be more like Pho.  The place is pretty small. Went in with a group of 8, and our table was pretty squished together."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place out because the reviews were good. Sat down and waited for about 15 minutes. Two large Asian families came after me and were helped. I guess if you're not Asian and speak the language, expect to wait a while. Very disappointed. I ended up going to the pho restaurant next to it where they served my family right away."}
{"text":"My recommendation to the fellow Yelpers.Do not come here to dine. I would give out 0 Star if there was an option. 0 star for this restaurant.  Shame on this restaurant.  As a Chinese customer myself, I was recommended by my friends to dine here.   That was a year ago. Things did not turn out pleasant. Let's say they do not take any credit cards or debit cards. It was OK, I promised my bud,it was my treat.I paid in cash. The total check was $35.  I left $45 on the tray ,which was 2 x 20 and. 1 x 5. (Leave her a $10 tip)  That shameless waitress took the tray,and she came back ,claiming that by saying that asuzing me only left 1 x 20 and 1 x 5 on the tray.   So instead of I tip her 10 bucks,I was short of her 10 dollars from the total check. I know how much money that I left on the tray(I am a BANK OF AMERICA CASH REWARDS CREDIT CARD FAN and I only carried $45 in total in my wallet on that day), she was rude and mistaken by mixing my money with other tables' change. I was even going to call 911 on the spot bcz she even refused to check her camera footage which there's a camera above the cashier register.    That night was the last night my dear bud in Vegas,thanks to that low intelligence waitress, he did not leave Vegas with a pleasant experience. He could testify me that I paid in full and left a generous tip in cash that night.  My recommendation to the fellow Yelpers.Do not come here to dine. I would give out 0 Star if there was an option."}
{"text":"Vegas lacks a really good taiwanese noodle shop.   Been going to this place lately for beef noodle soup.  Pretty descent broth and noodle.  I wish the appetizers were better."}
{"text":"This is a no frills place located in Las Vegas' Chinatown Plaza. It's an easy drive from the strip or there's a bus on Spring Mountain you can catch over by The Fashion Show Mall. Everything on the menu is reasonably priced. The stewed beef with noodle in spicy beef soup was very tasty. The shrimp, pork, and chive dumplings were good as well although they were either steamed or boiled. I think they would've been better pan fried."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on our way out from Vegas because my friend was craving soup noodles and said this place was a must try.   I ordered the BEEF STEW SOUP, which was surprisingly not that bad. The noodles had a good texture, al dente! I like that the soup base is actually spicy, unlike some of the other soups I've had. Probably not as good as some of the noodle places I've had in the 626, but not too bad if you're in Vegas and you're craving some soup noodles.   Prices are decent, ~$8-9, after tax and tip."}
{"text":"Best Beef Noodle.  Everytime when i travel to Las Vegas, I will stop by."}
{"text":"(+)(+)(+) authentic (-) meat (beef noodle soup) could use some more work  I am from Taiwan. This tastes like home. Albeit this isn't a quality that I would wait in line for if I were in Taiwan, but here in the States, it doesn't get more real than this.  Beef noodle soup - meh, good broth and noodles, mediocre on the meat Veggies in garlic - good, tastes like any other asian sautéed veggie dish Spicy wonton - good, could be more spicy? Pork ears - amazing, it's so hard to find real pork ears... The ears here were not store bought, not excessively fatty, had cartilage in every piece, with good sauce. What else can I say? The ears tasted like they ought, which in America is actually high praise. Green bean soup - amazing. Again, not special, just authentic. Tastes just like how my grandma makes hers. Makes me miss home...  In summary, nothing special. Tastes like a mom and pop shop in any alley of Taipei Taiwan. But that's the crazy thing, tastes just like it does in Taiwan, not adulterated with western influences. Nothing against good American food, but sometimes I just appreciate real Chinese food too."}
{"text":"Walked past this restaurant one evening with a bunch of Yelpers and was finally able to try it this weekend. After looking at there menu, I was surprised to find out the specialize in Taiwanese cuisine  What really caught my eye was the fact they have shaved ice, Taiwanese-style. The selection of additions is limited. They have all the usuals though: grass jelly, lemon jelly, red bean, green bean, taro, boba, pineapple, peach, and two or three others. Of course they have simple syrup and sweetened condensed milk. They advertise a special \"black sugar\" shaved ice, but that was not available both times I was there. There is only one size of shaved ice available and the price was under $6 for a large serving.  The other menu item that caught my eye was the beef noodle soup! You can get it with thin or wide noodles. On their menu, the option for \"hand-pulled\" noodles is listed, but after asking, the chef that does that was not there that day. Unfortunately, the dish itself was only average. The soup was not too salty, had good beef and star anise flavor, but it was also very, very oily. We ordered half meat, half tendon, it came to us more like quarter beef and three-quarter tendon. The meat was not braised long enough and was still a little tough. As for the tendon, they only had thinly sliced tendon, no big chunks, so it was very tender.   I also ordered their plum drink. It was not the style I liked, it was not brewed. Instead, they took the dried, salted plums and threw it into a pot of hot water along with some sugar, there were no other herbs or flavor to the drink.  Service was quick and friendly, they always kept my ice water full, so no complaints there. Overall, I would definitely come back for there shaved ice, especially on those hot summer days. I don't think I would go back for their beef noodle soup, but I would definitely like to try their other dishes: dumplings, pork chop rice, etc."}
{"text":"YES YES YES YES! I hit the spot today. Went into the Chinatown Mall in Las Vegas today since it's a must visit place when your Chinese (well, this applies to any city). We were craving for some good Taiwanese food (something a little better than Tea Planet). This place hit the spot as we walked in.   It was very similar to Taiwan's family owned shops. You walk in and the menu is on the wall on top of the cashier. Order first, then choose the empty table that you want to sit at. As stated before, the place is a family owned restaurant. The lady behind the cashier seems to be a relative of the cooks in the kitchen.   Anyways, as we are waiting for the food... I observed the family owned business. They were super nice to all the customers. But one thing that strucked us was the Taiwanese spoken by the girl behind the counter. She had some funny mandarin mixed with broken Taiwanese. We were speaking to her in Taiwanese and correcting her as she goes. She wasn't mad at us or anything, but it made the wait time seem short.   Food on the other hand was excellent. I love the beef noodle soup! It was very close to what you can get in Taiwan. Broth was definitely tasty and the meat was juicy and tender. Noodles were thick and flat! Oh, and unlimited supply of preserved veges for the beef noodle soup! One more thing, try their dumplings and their cold dishes. Those hit the spot too. In fact, it was so good that I craved to go back for the next 5 days while I worked in Vegas.   They open til 2am on couple days of the week.  Go! you don't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"After multiple recommendations, I zipped over to the noodle pot for rainy day soup.  The service was friendlier than expected.  The place is little and hard to find if you don't know what you are looking for.   We shared the spicy won tons and I had the beef tenderloin soup.  The wontons were delicious, piping hot, and spicy. The beef tenderloin soup was excellent and flavorful.  The noodles were pleasantly chewy and the broth required no additions.   The beef was very tender and shredded right apart - reminiscent of a braised beef short rib - however, extremely fatty.  I spent loads of time removing large chunks of fat from my soup.   A delicious soup; something different than pho.  I'll go back."}
{"text":"I tried this place last year and I failed to write a review. So far, this is my favorite place for Taiwanese beef noodle soup.   I ordered #6 beef & tendon noodle soup and #2 spicy beef noodle soup. Both of them were very tasty. The broth wasn't over powering but just right for my taste. I love the texture of their noodle. It's a cross between udon and ramen.   The servers speak Mandarin but they do speak some English. The servers are polite. If you want hot tea instead of water, ask for hot tea.   This place does get busy so come early for dinner. There's nothing like a nice beef noodle soup on a winter night."}
{"text":"Great beef noodle soup - both clear and spicy broth were amazing. Beef roll was made with egg and not the thicker scallion pancake traditionally used which turned me a bit off - flavor good but texture off.  However, the beef noodle soup will hit the spot - not too salty and the beef was excellent. Coming back!"}
{"text":"Tired of Vegas buffets? Then venture out and don't be disappointed.  Noodle pot serves up some fairly legit Taiwanese cuisine that definitely rivals that in either LA or the Bay Area. The beef and tendon noodle soup is to die for. Packed with flavor, this soup definitely brings a little heat to the palate too...but all in good form. The beef was fork tender and the tendon was just chewy enough and not a hair bit tough. The noodles were excellent too. Chewy without being too dense. Definitely a winner.  We also tried the pork and chive dumplings. Very standard, but still well done. The skin was not too thick nor floury and dumplings had good filling. The pork chop noodle soup was an excellent non-spicy counterpart to the spicy beef and tendon soup. The pork chop was juicy and charred to perfection. The only dish that I thought could have been better was the ja jiang mien. It just didn't have much flavor in my opinion."}
{"text":"I love noodles, and I am always looking for good noodle shops around town. Noodle Pot is definitely one of them. My favorite dish is the Beef Noodle Soup, and adding seaweed to the soup makes it even more delicious!"}
{"text":"I was getting tired of the buffets on the strip, so we taxied out to Chinatown and found this little Taiwanese noodle restaurant. This ended up being my favorite meal in Vegas. The food here was better than any of the buffets on the Strip, IMHO!   Recommended Dishes: - Beef Noodle Soup - Marinated Cucumbers - Beef Wrap (this was delicious! must get!)  The interior is like a little noodle joint, so don't expect anything nice and fancy. But the food is vurr good. A good break from stuffing your face with candied apples and seafood from buffets."}
{"text":"Spicy beef and tendon (there is another beef and tendon further down on the menu, without spicy in the description)--big bowl, lots of noodles, BIG chunks of meat and tendon. Really strong broth--a little salty to finish off, but really good for the noodles."}
{"text":"Winter is here and time for some of my favorite foods soups and stews Mmmm. I found this place last winter it is a deep rich hardy thick broth and hand cut noodles large pieces of beef (other options as well)  I get the beef stew my boyfriend gets the beef tendon combo.  It has bite and says spicy but I could handle way more if needed.  We also listened to fellow yelpers and got the spicy wontons those were delish, thanks Yelp!   The decor is minimal get the food and get out kinda decor.  I am always the only white person there and sometimes the only one who only speaks english.  Buses will show up and can sometimes have a line.  Like I said get your food and get out!  The service is typical china town service and I love it!  They are not rude but they mean business!    This place is so good I can almost eat a whole bowl!  We can also get our for around $20 without the appetizer."}
{"text":"I've been here several times in the past and since it was a cold day something soupy sounded good. Parking can be painful here during peak hours but I was fortunate to locate a good spot.  I've been avoiding spicy food since it irritates my PV illness so I ordered the regular beef noodle soup. The soup was decent but overall I prefer the spicy beef noodle soup. Another con here is it's cash only.  I doubt I'll return since there are so many other noodle houses that offer better quality and accept plastic!"}
{"text":"#1 thing to order here is the Taiwanese beef noodle soup.  Consisting of beef and tendon stew, a dark brown broth (beef broth), chewy delicious noodles, and bok choy, you have a full meal for less than the price of a single hand of BlackJack.  Even on a hot summer day, the noodle soup just fills that empty stomach like there's no tomorrow.  Order some spicy dumplings as a side dish along with a cold drink or tea and you have a complete meal.  The dumplings are optional if you don't eat that much."}
{"text":"I've lived in and traveled around China long enough to have developed a deep craving for beef noodle soup, and this place hits the spot. Amazingly delicious food can be found in the skeeziest looking shops over there. Most places, families live in the same run down shack as their \"restaurant\"; so you'll often find the owners' socks and undies drying in the bathroom. You'll be faced with a few basic tables with creaky little stools, a menu board on the wall, and not much else. It takes some getting used to, but I've now come to associate the dumpiest looking shacks with the promise of the most soulfoul food. Noodle Pot is not terribly dumpy, but it does have that basic noodle hut vibe. It's tiny and simple. The menu offerings are narrow. And the soup is hearty and plentiful. Eight bucks will get you a very substantial bowl of tender beef and noodles with the ubiquitous bok choy. Make sure to doctor it up with plenty of whatever is in the jars and bottles on the table (most likely dark vinegar, soy sauce, and chili paste). Then say so long, tuck in and disappear. The flavors are deep and satisfying, right on the money. One senses that many hours have gone into the rich broth and meltingly tender beef. The noodles don't appear to be hand made, as they lack the characteristic tenderness and touthsomeness. These are fine, but they don't make the dish which is all about the beef and the broth. Rather disappointing was the cold cucumber dish I ordered. In China the crushed cucumber dish is about as standard a way to begin a meal as the bread basket is in the west. Over there you will get fresh chunks of crunchy cukes dressed lightly with rice vinegar, and often accompanied by peanuts. Cold, crunchy, salty, a bit of sour--it's a freakishly addictive way to begin a meal. The one I received at Noodle Pot was a sad, pale version of the standard. The cucumbers were soft and wilted, with almost no crunch or flavor. They had clearly sat too long and should not have been served.   Service is a non-issue in a joint like this. The gals take your order, bring your food and largely ignore you unless you flag them down. This is the norm in China, where you have to shout at the servers to get their attention. It isn't considered rude for them to ignore you, or for you to holler across the room at them. It's all business here; you come in, sit down, order your dishes, and start slurping. The evening I came in plenty of folks were crowded around the tables, hunched over, slurping away. It's exactly how it should be in place like this, and its why I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff! The beef noodle soup is really good. Recommended if you want Taiwanese food in the area."}
{"text":"Love is place...always come here when I am in town...beef roll is real good.  Also love the noodle and red oil dumplings.  Cash only."}
{"text":"Last time I'm ever gonna eat here . I found a piece of hair in my food confronted them about nicely and they didn't bother to do anything about it. My family's  food was cold and the service was very disappointing."}
{"text":"The service is off in a funny/cute way here...i asked the girl to recommend some non-meat noodle offerings and she recommended the beef noodle soup...hahaha... I gave in and said ok just easy on the meat.  Great deal for $8."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth trying. The duck soup's broth and duck was very good, however I wasn't a huge fan of the noodles. The wait staff were friendly."}
{"text":"I use to frequent this location almost once a week which made me a regular. I go to West Charleston campus so this was my go to.   My gripe isn't the food but the service and management. So I ordered Beef Noodle Soup, which only a few minutes soon after, I grabbed the waitress's attention and requested my order to be substituted with wide noodles. Keep in mind, the food did not hit my table yet. The waitress said that it's already made (as in the kitchen) so my request had to be declined.   I'm never the one to feel entitled, I'm super understanding, and try to find a middle ground. Rather, she chose to shove this deal breaker to me. As this bowl of soup and noodles is skated onto my table, I'm just looking at my order as if it was forced upon me. I wasn't pleased as a customer, it wasn't the exact order which I had asked for, but yet, I'm expected to not only pay, but also eat it in misery. Out of all places, I chose Noodle Pot. And yet, this is how they chose to treat a regular. If they were smart about their business, with just a small accommodation, they could of made money on the ROI. As I continuously kept returning, especially with friends and family.  Long story short, I told the waitress/cashier lady that I don't think it's right to charge me for something I didn't eat. I initially was going to pay for my order but I pulled my card out because it didn't sit right with me. I said I didn't eat it because it is not what I requested as an order. She blamed me for not requesting wide noodles from the get go. She said she would modify my order and ring me up a new order as long as I paid for the first order. So essentially, she wanted me to pay for two orders. These bowls are $13 each. And I know they're also expecting a tip. She said she was the supervisor and I asked to speak to someone above her.   I was handed the phone with the manager to come to a resolution. As I'm explaining to the manager over the phone, he tells me that the waitress said that I've already ate the food. The phone was passed back and forth as they're speaking in Chinese and I'm explaining over the phone to the manager in English. Furious and frustrated, I told him that I'm not paying, and with that said, that I won't return back. The manager said and I quote, \"yeah don't comeback, we don't want people like you, but you still have to pay\". I wasn't going to leave cheated and hungry. And I didn't really want to simply walk out because it is not right. But I did coz i don't hand over my money to bad servicing cheaters."}
{"text":"Just randomly visited the area and arrived at this store.  The noodles are freshly made by in house.  Priced one or two dollars higher than expected, but well worth it.  Tasty noodle in a small shop.  Worth your time to visit."}
{"text":"Don't know why it says open til 2 am on Saturdays it's not. Annoying! Get your information accurate."}
{"text":"...... Authentic? Or you could say it's a little run down, a little dirty and a little unwelcoming.   Noodle Pot is a little shop in the main Chinatown Plaza. Parking is free and never an issue and there is plenty of boba/dessert/bars to go to nearby.  The restaurant has less than 10 tables and no one seems to speak English. I'm glad my partner spoke Mandarin, because they seemed to become more welcoming once they knew we knew what we were doing. Whew.   The food is good and according to my Taiwanese friend, as authentic as you can get in Vegas. We ordered the noodles, beef roll and dumplings. The dumplings were good, but a little disappointing when I saw them pull out a giant bag of frozen dumplings from the freezer next to me. Do that where I can't see, guys.  Compared to Noodle Pot II, the food here is better. BUT Noodle Pot II is cleaner, newer, friendlier and more welcoming to those that aren't Chinese/Taiwanese food experts. Between the two locations, I would stick to Noodle Pot II."}
{"text":"A-ok spot for some beef noodle soup. I didn't like that the soup had all sorts of beef floaties in it. Shoulda dump that pot of water after all the floaties come out of the beef 10 minutes into boiling it.   Service was quick and fast. No complaints."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of their beef stew noodle soup!  If you enjoy spicy soup, this is the dish for you.  Plus, their portions are very generous.  It really, really fills you up.  Only drawback is that it's cash only.  Not really a big deal, but I'm just someone who doesn't really like carrying cash around."}
{"text":"This is a small authentic Taiwanese restaurant in the heart of Chinatown, near the main mall. The decor is simple and down to earth, the menu is also simple and limited, but the food is good and the service super friendly. We tried the beef slices & tendon noodle soup and the Beef roll; three stars for the food, and a fourth for service."}
{"text":"What's not to like about this place? Simple menu with a few noodle soup items and dumplings, that's it. I always have the beef noodle soup with an order of shrimp & chives dumplings. Just make sure you bring cash with you since they don't accept plastics!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Noodle Pot while walking through the Ranch 99 Chinatown plaza. It looked busy, I Yelped it and saw that it had gotten a decent reviews, so why not. Ordered a bowl of their signature beef noodle soup (in English on the menu overhead it all says \"beef noodle soup\" but they come with different things, like tendon, beef, etc.). We were seated right away as there was a table available, but while we were waiting for our food, a woman asked if someone was sitting there. We said no, and she plopped herself down while her hubby ordered food. We thought she just needed to get off her feet, but nope she was settling down and her husband sat right next to her. Okay, then.  Our beef noodle soup was okay, but they made it spicy at first and then said it only comes that way. I told her that the waitress said that they could make it non-spicy so then it took a while to come out. There are only about 10 tables in there, so don't expect to get seated right away if they're busy. We ordered the pork chop rice and when it came, I was like, \"Where's the batter?\" That's the first time in my life that I've ordered pork chop rice and it came like it was broiled. Weird. It tasted okay, but it's like going to KFC and ordering fried chicken and you come home and open the bucket and it's grilled chicken. Sucks.  It was about $8 each and you get plenty of food, but the noodles weren't the homemade kind I like and they weren't QQ enough. You know what I mean. Probably won't go back next time I'm in Vegas. I did like that they spoke Taiwanese and Mandarin though, and they were very nice there."}
{"text":"Service was okay, but the food was forgettable..  I've had a lot of beef noodle soup dishes in my lifetime, and this place doesn't quite cut it. I ordered the clear broth instead of the spicy broth, so perhaps that was the difference.   The pieces of beef were hard to chew on, and the broth and noodles were pretty bland. I think they tried to season it primarily with cilantro. I've never seen so much cilantro in a bowl of beef noodle soup.. it was too much."}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas my husband wanted to try a restaurant in Chinatown.  Drove to where there was a conglomeration of restaurants and parked.  Yelp rated this one pretty good so we said \"why not\".  Husband ordered braised pork over noodle which he said was pretty good. I ordered the eggplant and pork over noodle which was excellent.  Good choice!"}
{"text":"If you're in Vegas and looking for a bomb meal before you go out and get drunk off your ass, or you're looking for a hangover cure the next day, then this is the spot!  Hands down best beef noodles in Vegas, probably better than most beef noodles in the 626/909 area too. For a Taiwanese joint, this place is as authentic as it gets. The noodles are handmade and the perfect size. You don't find beef noodles with texture this good just anywhere. The broth is a little spicy (legit Taiwanese-style), so try the mild if you're scared of spicy shits.   The shrimp dumplings and wontons in chili sauce are delicious as well. Really reminds me of the ones you get in a Taiwanese night market. If you're down to try something new, I would also recommend the beef rolls.  I go here at least once every time I'm in Vegas and I'm in town quite often."}
{"text":"I think its time I finally shared my spot for Taiwanese Beef Noodle soup. Its a small location, family-owned and already having a religious following of yelpers who eat there, this place gets packed easily.   Forget the other noodles soups on the menu, go straight to the best-seller, Taiwanese Beef Noodle soup. You wont regret it. So lets talk broth first, hearty, full of flavor with a medium body. Spice it up with their house-made chilli sauce. Superb. The noodles are cooked perfectly for me, a little soft and not too chewy. Served with huge helpings of vegetables and soft beef chunks. I approve sides orders of beef roll and wonton dumplings in chilli oil. If you're carb-loading the beef rolls are calling your name! Made like a burrito and cut into pieces. Filled with beef shanks marinated in hoisin sauce stuffed with fresh vegetables. Don't think I need to go into great detail of their wonton dumplings. Other than its swimming in a pool of chilli oil heaven. A must try."}
{"text":"this is our favorite noodle spot.  Authentic taiwanese noodle and their beef is so tender. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm a big, big fan of beef stew noodle. I was back home in Vegas and was really craving my go-to-meal in SoCal - beef stew noodle. I decided to try out this little restaurant because the ratings weren't too bad.  I learned from my Taiwanese/Chinese friend that no one makes beef stew noodle the same, so I always keep an open mind to the different recipes and flavors. However, I was not as impressed with the food here. The broth was a lot thicker and oilier than other restaurants that I have tried. The food came out extremely fast, and it tasted as though they had kept the same broth warm all day (it was salty). Also, the broth already comes spicy (I usually have to ask to add spice elsewhere). I wanted to try their thick/wide noodles, but they had ran out that day.  This rating is solely on food, even though I feel like the restaurant could improve a little bit on their service. There were no spoons at our table, so I had to look around and grab some myself from their counter. I'm not a big stickler for those kinds of things, but I know some might find it to be bad service. The people are sweet though!   Maybe next time I'll have to try another dish to understand why people rave about this place!"}
{"text":"One of the few restaurants that make me sweat when I eat. The AC was either not working, or set at high temperature, makes for a bad dining experience. We were never asked what choice of noodle we wanted. The dumpling is really below average. The beef noodle is good but overpriced unless you compare it to casino restaurants.  Overall, it is overpriced compared to other local restaurants, and the food is average at best. With no ac, I will never return again."}
{"text":"Great service and excellent Beef Noodles.   Didn't find it on my first pass of the mall, but the food was definitely worth the search for this place."}
{"text":"Not a bad Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup...  From yelping around in Las Vegas, looking for a place that was still open late night, and targeting restaurants that had noodles...this establishment was the one that I chose for our intoxicated food adventure.  I was lured to this location not only because of the high ratings, but because of their advertisement of hand-made noodles.  The noodles were guud, indeed, they were very guud (especially because of the inebriation factor). The soup was flavorful and not very oily. The prices were very fair and the location is open till midnight. Service was very quick and pleasant.  Im usually a PHO-type of guy when it comes to drunk munchies, but after eating here, this place isnt a bad substitute.  RECOMMENDED!  UNTIL THEN!! ^-^"}
{"text":"This place was great!  So glad my friend chose it.  It is very small and you can only pay in cash!!  It's pretty good prices, so you don't need too much.  When we first walked in, it was super crowded. Every seat taken and a line out the door. However, the line moved pretty quick and by the time we got to the front, a table had cleared.   My friend had been many times so he suggested their famed Spicy Beef Noodle Stew. Another person ordered the one with tendons too, so I joined in this adventure and got the Spicy Beef and Tendon Stew.  Glad I did...it was delicious. Although my novice side showed, because when I eat these soups with noodles, I splatter juices all over me, the people at my table, and 3 tables over. :P Since I had somewhere to be afterwards and know of my rookie noodle eating skills, I was smart enough to wear a napkin bib. No, I didn't look like a tool at all. LOL!  Anyway, my friend also ordered the wontons in chili oil and they were delicious too! Definitely will be back with an old T-shirt or bib in hand! Yum!"}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall and food is just ok. I had the following:  Beef noodle half tendon soup: good just a bit spicy. Pork cabbage, shrimp chives dumpling: not bad just very small and small portioned Pork rice plate: a few pieces of extremely fatty pork with lots and lots of rice Wonton soup: the pork stinks  Service was pretty bad and tea was diluted and taste like hot water."}
{"text":"Typical Taiwanese food!!! Enjoy the delicious beef noodle soup and rice noodle soup a lot!!"}
{"text":"Decent beef noodle soup, with just the right amount of spiciness.  However, service was unorganized and orders got mixed up.  One of our orders never came out and we had to remind the waitress that we were expecting another dish.  Prices are good though if you're looking for an inexpensive restaurant off the strip."}
{"text":"My number one must go everytime i visit Las Vegas. We usually go for breakfast here. Great taiwanese noodle joint in Las Vegas. They famous of the spicy beef noodle soup. It is so yummy. The best i ever eat . Tasty without so overpowering oily .   The best part of it is they put pickled cabbage inside the soup which i never find it in other noodle house with the same menu."}
{"text":"Good homey food and tender juicy beef noodle soup just like in Taiwan. A surprise find in Vegas! Service could be a little faster."}
{"text":"This restaurant has really Chinese food... coming from a Chinese guy.  We had apicy beef tendpn, pig ear, dumpling and BEEF WRAPPED GREEN ONION PANCAKE. That green onion pancake was amazing!! I also had the #2 Beef & Tendon Noodle soup such was pretty darn good. The place isn't the most soaking place,  but the food is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Noodle pot serves the best beef noodle soup I've ever had. I'm Chinese so I've had a lot of beef noodle sooup in my life. I haven't had much else on the menu despite going there once every few weeks, but the beef rolls are pretty solid too.  The restauarant is a bit tough to find (it's on the western end of the Chinatown Plaza Mall), but once you get there you're in for a treat. There's not much in the way of decor or service (not bad, just basic), but you go to Noodle Pot for the food.  Tip: ask for thick noodles"}
{"text":"I drove all the way from the Bay Area to LAs Vegas just for their beef noodle soup ....it's always 100% satisfied!!! The best in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"I thought it was really funny that for parties of 6 or more, there is a mandatory 15% gratuity .. People in Chinatown must normally tip less than 15% ..   CASH ONLY  Prices were pretty fair !!! I ordered the zha jiang mian, and it was slightly different than what I'm used to seeing. It looked like minced pork on noodles here instead of the standard black bean stuff with cucumbers. While it was pretty good, it was not what I was expecting .. Also I think the egg was too salty.   The beef wraps were super good !!!! I highly recommend A+!!! But there is lots of cilantro in it for people who do not like cilantro! Also the pig ear and the marinated cucumbers were good.   Solid place and not super expensive !!"}
{"text":"Very good wonton soup and beef noodle stew."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a small place but didnt need to wait for seats.  I went w a friend and We both ordered the beef noodle soup and an order of shrimp dumplings. The waiter misunderstood us and thought we ordered one soup and one dumplings. I started the noodles, which were good in itself but the entire noodle soup was unappetizing and not very tasty. The meat was fatty and looked like scrap.   I don't like food, and esp meat, to go to waste but I could not get myself to finish this.   The shrimp dumplings weren't that great either.   I won't be dining at this place again."}
{"text":"Although I am not a big fan of beef noodles, I still wanted to come here and try their other dish. I ordered pig feet (i know, sounds scary) noodle soup.  I was not very impressed with it.  They were only 3 medium size pig feet in the soup, so it was not very filling.  I think the beef noodle soup would've been more filling.  But this place seems to be very popular as people kept coming in.  The turn over rate is pretty fast, so even if there is a line, i wouldn't think the wait would be too long.   If you are sick of buffets on the strip and feel like some hot (both temperature and spice) beef noodle soup, come and try this place."}
{"text":"I love taiwanese food so much. Food is legit in this place. Fast service for my hungry stomach."}
{"text":"Came here during winter break, and boy was it packed. All the Asians came here for their Chinese food fix instead of going to some buffet at a casino.  Coming from a place with a lot of good Chinese food, I'd have to say that this place wasn't the best. It was definitely not built for too many people and there were a billion people here trying to get a seat. The noodles here are really good. I got the pig feet soup, and I thought they cooked the meat quite well. My family got the beef noodle soup, which I was pretty standard asian fare. This place doesn't wow, but it is a pretty good place for its location."}
{"text":"authentic taiwanese food :)  i was born and grew up in taiwan, so you can trust my review that this is probably one of the most authentic taiwanese restaurant in chinatown.  i ordered the beef noodle soup with no beef (i'm not a vegetarian, just wasn't craving meat) and they happily accommodated to my order. it was good and normally i would prefer my noodles to be a little thicker but i can definitely taste the taiwanese!   i also tried the pork chop and it was delicious as well, they cook it as stew so it's not your ordinary pork chop!   this place is small and probably sit a total of 30 people total but it has all of my favorite taiwanese dishes. keep in mind the owner and workers are all taiwanese and they will speak to you in mandarin when you walk in. also, it's CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom nom nom. My mouth is watering. I think I'm due for a review too after eating here like everyday in November after discovering. My mom visited in March and we THOUGHT about going here but were sketchy about the cash only policy.  I have seriously missed out since then because i LOVE this place. The first time I came here my mom and I shared the beef noodle soup and the won ton soup. Both were so amazing with lots of fresh cilantro and green onion!   It's def not a fancy place but this place has super great and flexible hours. I think they are open until 2am on Friday/Saturday. This is the perfect place to go on a chilly Vegas night!"}
{"text":"The beef noodle soup is delish. Fast service but there is always this one lady thats rude, never smiles and always walks away while ur still ordering. Other than that the food is amazing! Perfect for quick lunch"}
{"text":"Dropped in here to try the won tons and beef roll.  Service was fast and friendly, food was good.  We ordered hot green tea and it was served piping hot in plastic cups, wtf?! Is that even safe?  The Won Tons in Red Chili sauce are awesome. They are topped with fresh cilantro, perfect with the acid from the vinegar sauce.  The beef roll was interesting, it's very sweet... like dessert sweet. The beef is tender and the fresh herbs and egg inside give it a light fluffy texture which I loved, but the sauce was too sweet or there was just too much of it for my taste.  I'm keeping this place bookmarked and will come back to try the dumplings and soup noodles, but won't make the mistake of ordering hot tea here again."}
{"text":"i havent had a good bowl of beef noodle soup in a long time!  i thought the flavor of the soup was good (usually it's not spicy enough or way too spicy but their soup was perfect amt of spiciness for me). i liked how they had plenty of pickled mustard greens, chives, and cilantro in your bowl, mmm. the noodles arent homemade but still a good texture. good-sized portion (i even took half of it home) considering how you pay $8 for a big bowl.   we also ordered the beef rolls which were a good appetizer. they make it with an \"dan bing\" aka egg tortilla."}
{"text":"Beef noodle soup was delicious, just the right mix of spiciness and flavor.  The pork rice dish was good too, savory with the right amount of sauce.  Not the cleanest place and a bit small (tight) but that just reinforces what this is - a yummy Taiwanese hole in the wall restaurant."}
{"text":"Beef noodle soup was alright; I had better, but the fried chicken on rice was pretty bad.  I was expecting the typical five spice Taiwanese fried chicken but it was smoked chicken?? Wth? It tasted like smoked ham but with chicken if that makes any sense.  Just weird and off. Definitely disappointing and will not come back."}
{"text":"I've been here before...but sadly have to give it a lower rating. I pointed to a picture and the item menu, had to them read it back to me...and somehow the minced porkbecame tofu with hard boiled egg....though I was charged for the other item (per the receipt).  Pretty sure what I paid for costs more.   It's on the other side of town and I ordered takeout so it is not a simple hop to fix.    I was the only other patron in there when they opened so there were not busy.  I suppose this means that someone who called in a takeout order also got the wrong one.  And it means I'll be untying the entire order and checking each one if I ever go back.   Very unfortunate and very disappointing.  Normally wouldn't gripe but I just spent the week saying how great this was to a friend who just came back into town and I was treating her.  So not a good outcome."}
{"text":"This is the best place to eat Chinese food in Vegas that i have even eat. Food have flavor really good. Customer service is really nice too. I would recommend to everyone who love Chinese noodle food."}
{"text":"I'm from NY and am use to not the realm Chinese food, lol. This is really the authentic Chinese noodle restaurant.  Very healthy and spicy food. They dont serve beef fried rice or eggrolls. it's the real deal...so enjoy, learn and eat if you want the real stuff"}
{"text":"This place is wicked!  I love their soup.  The look of the place can definitely push you away if you expect something Panda Express.  The place is clean but, is a hole in the wall that just has good food!  I've ordered both the wonton and beef soup with thin noodles.  You have a choice of thin or wide noodles.  I also believe the noodles are home made!  I've also tried the breaded pork over rice.  Super good!  If you're down for some home made style soup I would say this is the best place in town.  I would give this place 5 stars if the interior was a little nicer and if they took credit cards.  Cash only =("}
{"text":"Actually found this hole in the wall thru Yelp! Since then everytime I'm in Vegas it's a spot I like to hit. Probably 2-3 miles off the strip.  It's a small place but  it's also pricred well."}
{"text":"Slurpy Slurpy.  I must say I passed by this place weekly or monthly and never ventured in until today with the wife. Must say, it was a great experience!  We were reading some of the Yelpers reviews and gave it a shot! We wanted some beef noodles.  1.  The noodles - What the heck?  They did not buy this stuff from the store did they?  I found that the noodles here were white noodles , but slightly larger than the norm. The texture was awesome and the taste was literally a leap year from the regular noodles I have tried.  2.  Tenderloin Beef Noodle Soup - So delicate, tasty beef. Just the write cut of beef with a bit of tender fat and melt in your mouth beef.  The soup was very nice, subtle hints of the green onion and parsley gave it a very distinct flavor. This is what the wife ordered, but I kept on stealing a bit to give it a taste.  3.  Beef Stew Noodle Soup.  I love chinese style beef stew and this meat was the perfect balance of spice, taste, texture and delicacy. Would the word buttery be best to use?  This soup is slightly spicy, with a darker more salty flavor.  This is the first time I have drank the entire bowl of soup after the noodles and meat were finished off.  That is how good this soup was.  They have other items I haven't tried. The menu is a slip of paper with the items on it and you mark it off just similar to a sushi order sheet.  You kinda have to know what the noodles are and the other dishes are, or look at the pictures in the window.  I am coming back with the kids to try many more things, the dumplings, the fried noodles and etc.  GK says, check this place OUT!!!"}
{"text":"I regret not trying their beef noodle soup (main dish) because the dishes we ordered,  chicken leg with rice and noodle with meat sauce (Zha Jiang Mian) are definitely below average. Because of the lousy dishes we ordered, we are doubtful about going back for their beef noodle soup."}
{"text":"Limited menu (mainly noodles and dumplings); reasonable prices; fast food service; this place is usually packed during lunch/ dinner hours because price is right and food tastes great! I had a bowl of pork feet noodle soup here on a cold winter night so the hot noodles was especially delicious to me! Portion size was just good.  Service was accommodating; the servers were very busy but still trying to accommodate everybody by getting the people seated and bringing the foods out ASAP. Good job!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is on of the best that I've had. I am now a active goer to this place! They're beef noodle soup is one of the best things on menu. Also they're portions are very generous and they really work to become an aspiring business. Even though they get busy, they serve you and get you so they can keep running. They don't wanna keep people waiting for their food. Sometimes when they aren't busy, you may see the owner just sitting there reading. As a boss he still helps and is really social. I love this place."}
{"text":"The noodle soup is delicious.  I have never had it before, but my husband is very familiar with it.  The flavor is very particular and not for everyone, but I appreciated its flavor balances. I ordered the spicy beef noodle, which was delicious, but not spicy, just fyi.  And my husband ordered beef tendon noodle soup, which he said tasted just like mine.  The food is very inexpensive.  Super authentic Taiwanese noodle soup.  Service is very good.  The ambience could be even the slightest bit nicer, and it would do wonders for the mood."}
{"text":"stumbling onto noodle pot is like finding a gallon of water in the middle of dessert for me, used to live in cali and taiwanese food comes in handy, but things change once i moved to hawaii,  most of the items in the store reminiscent of my childhood memory regards how taiwanese food should taste like, i was gratified and wish i had pay more visit to the restaurant during my stay in vegas"}
{"text":"Try their beef noodle soup!  I mean it, it's goooood!!  I ordered #1 (spicy beef noodle soup) and it was delicious.  The soup is flavorful and the portions are generous.  In addition, it wasn't all that expensive either.  My friends and I were thinking about stopping by this place a second time but we didn't have enough time but my mouth is watering just thinking about their beef noodle soup.  Mmmmm, it reminds me of the beef noodle soup that I had in Taiwan!"}
{"text":"Great food at affordable prices. Wonton or dumpling plate is exquisite. The spicy beef wide noodle stew is delectable."}
{"text":"stumbled onto this place on yelp as i was looking for dinner near my hotel.  first off - im vegan  i got a marinated pressed tofu appetizer, which was just okay, and then  i ordered the vegetarian delight noodle soup. i don't think it had anything that wouldn't be vegan friendly. it had bok choy, a bunch of mushrooms, and some little sweet tofu looking things. it was honestly pretty good. can't complain. wasn't super salty like soups usually are so i really enjoyed it. it is a big bargain for ur buck since it's $8 and the bowl  is huge! i couldn't finish it.    service was alright. i mean i walked in and got seated right away. one of the employees asked me something in another language and idk what the hell she said lol. they checked up on us once and made sure things were okay. that was it really.  idk i probably wouldn't come back haha"}
{"text":"Man oh man you have to love a spot like Noodle Pot.  Small, family run place in the 99 Ranch plaza serving awesome noodles and dumplings at reasonable prices with great service.  They refilled my water like 5 times when I was there (very dry tonight).    Went with a group and we shared the following:  1) Dry noodle dish ja jiang mein - their noodles are really great.  I'm not sure if the version we had was with the hand cut noodles but whatever it was it was great.  Noodles were nice and tender with just a little bit of a bite still to them.   2) One order of chive dumpings, one order of napa cabbage dumplings - yum.  Nice pork dumplings with your choice of veggies.  Meat was nice and flavorful.  Served with a soy sauce based sauce that was nice as well.   3) Soup dumplings  - delicious  Wish I could go into more detail but my knowledge of asian cooking techniques isn't really on par with my knowledge of Western cooking.  But everything was really delicious.  I will definitely be going back again and again.  My new favorite restaurant in Chinatown Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I like this small hole in the wall Taiwanese restaurant.   Their specialty is their beef noodle soup. I always order it with vermicelli noodles ( the clear ones) cause it's my favorite. It makes the dish feel lighter and less carbo loaded. I thought the beef was tender and the broth was rich in flavor.  Generous meat proportions too.   Their spicy wontons were good. The chili oil is not actually that spicy though. Looks intense but it's pretty mild in nature. Doable if you can handle a little spice.    I thought their beef wraps were a little disappointing. There wasn't much flavor to it and the beef was a little chewy. I wish they put hoisin sauce in it to make it a little sweeter and saucier.   Overall I would come back again but I'll stick to my beef noodle soup."}
{"text":"My family like the spicy beed crew noodle..that is big beef in the soup..and the soup is taste very nice"}
{"text":"So far, my favorite noodle soup place in all of LV.  You get a choice between their thin noodles and thick noodles.  Never had the thick ones, but they look OK.  The thin noodles aren't like egg noodles or anything - it's more like udon thickness if I have to describe it.   I've had the beef noodle soup a few times and its pretty consistent.  The broth, although dark, is not very salty (the times that I've had it anyway) and had a good flavor.  The beef is very tender and melts in your mouth.   I've also tried their wonton soup, which is good, but pales in comparison to the beef noodle soup.  I wish they had siracha there - it would make my soup complete (but that's just my personal taste).   If you're in the mood for rice, don't hesitate to try to the pork chop over rice.  A breaded pork chop and it comes with some minced pork over the rice.  Very good!  I like to take the extra beef from my soup and eat it with the rice.   The place itself is pretty modest.  Nice service and normally quick, although last time we were here they forgot to give me my side of rice until the end of my meal when it was already pointless.  But I like the food so that's what keeps me coming back!   My only gripe is that they take cash only (which is inconvenient for a person that doesn't carry cash!).  Instead of going to an ATM, just walk over to the Ranch 99, buy something small, and get some cash back.    Anyway, a solid noodle spot.  I can't wait to take my dad, who is a beef noodle soup fanatic, here one day"}
{"text":"A hole in the wall, reasonably-priced Taiwanese restaurant in the Chinatown Plaza. Don't expect anything fancy; this spot is where locals flock to. Their spicy beef noodle soup and sliced stew beef noodle soup is really good! The beef was tender. Savory broth. I recommend the sliced stew beef noodle for anyone who doesn't like spicy food. The wonton noodle soup was underwhelming. Nothing special. Not flavorful. The noodles used for all three of these dishes were consistently good (thicker noodles cooked al dente). I heard this place uses MSG though. tldr; get the spicy beef noodle soup"}
{"text":"Oh no, not in a heartbeat im comin back. Food and service its a 1-1. The soup I ordered was not fresh and tasty at all. Dining had this foul smell of rotten food coming from the kitchen. Sorry but it's a NO."}
{"text":"This place is CHEAP and really good food! I had the wonton soup and it was THE BOMB! also try their dumplings really really tasty.. I would highly recommend this place.. it is cheap and very good.. I would definitely come back here.. this is located right next to Ranch 99 market in the chintown center.. try now!"}
{"text":"Good food n good service.  Prices r higher than others but I guess it's because they re in the mall.  Air cond needs to be turned on r turned up cuz it was way too hot in there."}
{"text":"What we usually order have been very good. Pork Chop over rice. Meat sauce (minced pork) over rice. Pot stickers.  Service is typical chinese restaurant affair, order and eat, pretty basic.  It's a mom and pa's little diner, I don't get why some people have to bitch about its appearance. This business is rated $ single dollar sign - cheap. Expect no frill decor and no frill services. It's so pretentious that some people would walk into a single-dollar rated restaurant and criticize its decor or lack of service refinement.  Those ladies need to get a life."}
{"text":"Want to try some quality beef soup noodles?  A few simple choices an you're there:   1.  Beef, beef tendon, or a combination of both. 2.  Thin or thick (hand cut ribbons) noodles. 3.  Mild or spicy soup.  The hardest thing is finding the place.    Deconstructed:  Very well seasoned, deep beefy soup base with the wafting aroma of star anise, hint of ginger, and dried citrus peels.  Great noodles with just the right amount of chew.  Clean, tender, gelatinous tendons (sounds disgusting but \"a rose by any other name...\").  The only catch, the beef is sometimes over braised.  Tender, but dry.  Very common, I'd guess it's authentic by default.  Beef stew soup $8. Beef tendon soup $9.  Combo at $8.50  A simple meal doled out in a non descript restaurant with \"classic\" service (you got your food right?)  It is what it is and that's not bad at all."}
{"text":"As the current reigning  duchess of Noodle Pot, I think I'm due for a review. I come here for one thing and one thing only--their best seller, Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup.  The noodles are usually cooked soft with just a bit of bite. If it were up to me, I would prefer them a little more chewy. But the broth has a light to medium body and is packed full of flavor and I can honestly say that the broth alone makes up for a limp noodle. On top of it all, the braised beef and tendon are always tender and delicious. And it's all served with a healthy serving of fresh and pickled vegetables. After trying a few other noodle dishes here, I came to the conclusion I don't like any of it. But if I'm feeling frisky, I'll mix in a Beef Roll with my noodle soup. Noodle Pot's beef roll is a popular Taiwanese finger food. Scallion, cilantro, sweet/savory hoisin sauce, and tender chunks of beef shank are rolled in a slightly chewy pancake. At first glance, I would compare it to a crepe-like burrito. I suggest digging in with your hands and dipping in a bit of black vinegar. Delicious!  Decor is your typical no-frills, family-owned, Asian hole-in-the-wall. Nothing fancy, but always clean. Their English isn't the best either so if you don't know your basic Chinese just point at the number you want. All in all, service is friendly enough to make this a quick stop for a bite to eat. Just make sure you remember this place is CASH ONLY! If you forget, buy some gum at 99 Ranch Market and get cash back. (Been there done that)."}
{"text":"I've walked by this place so many times, but never realized what they sold here!  Went with the Beef Stew Noodle Soup ($7.99). Lots of beef \"parts\" and bok choy in a fairly spicy broth...good stuff! Noodles are thicker, broth is very heavy and oily with lots of flavor.  I tried asking the lady what \"parts\" were in the soup...not much English, so all I got was \"beef\" LOL.  Looked like knuckle/oxtail meat and tongue were in there...probably better I not know actually!  I might be back...it was good, but can't say it hits my Ramen/Pho/Soup craving, so it's a good bowl to change things up every once in a while!  Pic :"}
{"text":"The food at Noodle Pot was nothing exceptional. Combined with the horrible service we received (if you can call walking up to order your own food/get refills/etc while everyone else if being served) actual service.  We were the only people eating in the restaurant that were not offered water or menus, and our food came out of the kitchen noticeably slower than those dishes ordered by groups that had arrived after us.  Save yourself the time and hassle, and try a different noodle spot (like Joyful House) instead."}
{"text":"YUM!  Tasty beef noodle soup!  Delicious wonton in chili sauce!  Everything else here kinda sucks but really why explore a menu when you have found gold?"}
{"text":"As someone who has been to Taiwan numerous times and has been captivated by the delightful taste of ???, or beef noodle soup, and someone who has been equally disappointed time after time trying to find a good beef noodle place shop in America, I can successfully say that I have found one place that has pretty authentic and delicious beef noodle soup.  Noodle Pot is located in Chinatown of Las Vegas, in a small shopping center, and is always busy with customers when I go. It seats about 40 people on the inside, so if you are going with a pretty big party (6+) at a peak time, I would say be prepared to wait a bit, but the food is definitely worth the wait.  Even when it is busy and I order the ????? (No. 1) on the menu and other people in my party order other dishes, the food never takes more than 10 or 15 minutes to come out. The store sells other Taiwanese side and main dishes that taste delicious as well, but none as good as the beef noodle soup.  The store has free wifi, and for all you Pokemon Go fans, is located close to three Pokestops as well. But don't just come for the free wifi, definitely try some soup as well!"}
{"text":"I'm on a trip from Singapore, and we have very good Chinese cuisine back home. When I came here I didn't have my hopes up, but oh my goodness, the ????? is phenomenal! Comparable to restaurant taste!"}
{"text":"Fried pork chop rice was good, meat was juicy, generous servings topped with a braised egg. Pickled cucumbers and braised pigs ears were delicious too! Also tried the famous half tenton half meat beef noodle soup, not bad but not that fantastic as what others say. Server is very friendly, enjoyed our lunch there!"}
{"text":"This is me and my wife's favorite place to eat when we come to Vegas. It's cheap and tasty. They recently started accepting credit/debit cards (over $20), which should allow them to increase their business. I usually order the traditional Spicy Beef Noodle Soup aka: #1 on the menu. The noodles are freshly made and very soft and tender. The soup broth has so much flavor with herbs and a good portion of meat. The only thing is sometimes they put too much soup (which I don't mind), or they don't put enough; so if you like to have a very tasty soup and they don't put enough soup broth in it; just ask and they will add more soup broth.   My wife always orders the Minced Pork Noodles which is a dry soup with a creamy pork creation poured over the dry noodles (again - made freshly in house). Then we the won-ton in chili soy sauce which will compliment any entree you order if you like a little kick to the meal. Drinks are limited in terms of selection but water is usually the best beverage since some of the dishes have that kick."}
{"text":"my friends ordered their soup noodles and are good as other reviews wrote,  but the rice dish i ordered is soso. suggest to orDer noodle soups."}
{"text":"I'd say this place has the best beef noodles in town! (Closest to Taiwanese flavor) I can't say much about other items cuz I only order beef noodles (#2)  & dumplings when I'm here. Food is Consistent everytime, service is good as well. They have tourist rush here and there but never had attitude."}
{"text":"We had beef stew noodle soup, spicy and tasty, different than pho or Chinese noodle soup.  The beef pancake is good too, they were delicious.  The price is around $8 and $9.  The portion is good. The service is fast.  A small place but good noodle soup, we would come back again."}
{"text":"I ordered the veggie noodle bowl, its was delicious! The broth, noodles and veggies tasted fresh and amazing! And the staff there were nice and friendly. I'm definitely coming back to try something else! Thank you for your kind service and delicious food."}
{"text":"it was a rainy day and were craving  some hot soup , so we came to try this place . got the beef noodle soup that everybody is raving about and some homemade dumplings in beef soup . somehow our orders were not done correctly and I got thin noodles instead of thick noodles. we also got the wrong kind of dumplings . the flavor of the soup was good and I would have enjoyed the beef noodle soup more , if they gave me the right type of noodles for it . the dumplings were disappointingly small and also not what we ordered , so minus I star for that"}
{"text":"Yum, all I can say is YUM. Finally a small mom and pop store that sells authentic chinese noodles that actually taste good!  We ordered: 1) Beef Stew Soup Noodle (lamian)- wide noodles. Its a hearty, rich soup. Noodles are perfectly cooked, light and chewy goodness! Remember good korean & chinese noodles should have a bite, not soggy or too soft!  2) Pork Chop Rice- the pork was not greasy at all, the ran out of rice so they gave up a bowl of vegetable broth with bok choy and regular noodles. The broth was very very light & had a slight hint of an onion taste!  3) Zha Jian (lamian)- wide noodles. Its the orginal version of a korean chachang myeun. Sooo refreshing with the cucumbers lbean sprouts! This was my fav!  4) Boiled Dumpling (chives)- mmmm tastes like my mom's homemade dumpling. Chives & shrimp chunks.   5) Meat cold dish combination- marinated tripe, pork, tendon. The sauce they used has a nice, slight spiciness to compliment the meats.  Overall, my bf, friends and I would definitely come back here. We can't believe this place opened up last november. Also, you know they use real ingredients & not msg when you walk out without being thirsty :)   I've always been a supporter of mom and pop stores & this store deserves an A+!!!"}
{"text":"Beef noodle soup is great. Also the shrimp dumplings are really tasty. I definitely recommend this place. Although, they do use a good amount of msg... at least it definitely tastes like it"}
{"text":"Love this little place and the quick service. I usually get the spicy beef noodles. It is rich, meaty and a little spicy. It is loaded with beautiful and tasty noodles, a rich broth, chunks of beef, bok choy and cilantro. So good!"}
{"text":"This place is \"OK\".  The noodle is nothing special.  The soup base is so so.  When it said half tendon and half beef, it means different than what you expect.  It is also a little pricey.  There are a lot of better places for noodle."}
{"text":"Cheap place ,they don't give you enough food ,slots rice ,very little meat ,and wants to pay extra for the meat to make complete meal"}
{"text":"We came here for a late night snack and the noodle soup was amazing. Must get the beef brisket noodle soup!!"}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars. Taiwanese beef noodle soup is what I ordered because I'm looking for something similar to Din Tai Fung's. This place is located next to Chinatown Mall behind a statue and where there's a \"2-Hour Parking\" limit painted on each parking spot.  The people here barely speak English and the few diners the day we went were Chinese and Taiwanese slurping thei soup away - signs of authenticity? Perhaps. Our food came out quick and piping hot. My beef noodle soup wasn't very meaty and I got some with lots of fat. There's fresh bok choi...yum. Noodles were cooked perfectly.  The food was good but sadly, it wasn't even close to satisfying my DTF beef noodle soup craving. I'm still on the hunt for DTF-esque noodles."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim and ordered the potstickers! MUST HAVE! My sister ordered the fried pork chop with rice and was also in heaven! Their staff is polite and the woman that took our order was so nice! We're definitely coming back her! For two meals and two drinks it came up to around $20! Not bad at all!"}
{"text":"My mom ordered the duck noodle, they gave her only bones, my beef brisket was sliced so thin. Prices are way too high, service is bad. This will be my first and last time there  $9.50 for a bowl of beef noodle? What a joke"}
{"text":"My husband loves Noodle Pot and it is his favorite place to get some Taiwanese beef noodle soup. I've never had it here until my husband took me here when we were still dating. And then my parents would often bring take out back from their Henderson location.   One thing for certain is that they give you a nice hearty portion when you order their beef noodle soup. The bowl is giant, even when you order the take out version. A lot of the times, I can't finish an order myself. They give you a lot of noodles, which are cooked perfect -- it has a nice chewy, firm texture to it. They also give you plenty of beef but not all the beef is tender -- some are a bit tough but the flavor is great either way. The soup base is really good, probably filled with MSG but that's probably better than it being bland. The only thing is that I wish it was a bit spicier .. it wasn't very spicy. I typically have to add more chili paste/oil to it when I eat it.   What's great is that this place is usually opened until midnight. If you got some late night cravings, you can always come here. And by late night, I mean Cinderella late. The server that we had was really nice and quick. We didn't have to wait too long for our food to come.  They used to be cash only but now they have a machine that takes card :) So no worries, come with your plastics."}
{"text":"A very small Hole in the wall place. Best Ramen noodles in town! We stop by each time we are in Vegas.   The #2 spicy beef noodles and pot stickers are our favorites when ordering.   Be prepared to be packed in a small Space. Sometimes you sit in front of their fridge and they will bug you when they need to open the fridge. Which is a hassle but worth it for the food. Be ware there is a $20 minimum for credit charge. Best to go with cash! Enjoy the yummyness!"}
{"text":"It was July 4 weekend and we've been fighting thru traffic on the road for 5 hours. When we got to our destination it was more than 100 degrees outside. Although it was freakin hot, I was really craving for some noodle soup. I found this place through yelp. I was disappointed. I ordered the beef noodle stew. Beef was tender and the noodle was pretty good, but there's no flavor in the soup. The broth was plain salty. There was no flavor. I needed to drink plenty of water just to dilute the amount of salt I have just taken into my body. I probably would come back to try a different dish though. Service was good and just like the majority of restaurants in Chinatown CASH only."}
{"text":"Small mom-and-pop-ish Taiwanese restaurant tucked in the middle of that Chinatown plaza with the elaborate archway.   I ordered the spicy beef noodle with tendons and the broth was full of flavor; it was an MSG fuckfest in my mouth. Tendons were thoroughly cooked and easily sinkable through my teeth. Because of that I told myself I would be a regular from now on since I wasn't thoroughly satisfied with Liang's Kitchen's light broth.   However the service was not prompt and it wasn't like I was expecting it in a no-frills, run-by-FOBs type of establishment.   Forward to payment time and our server was dissatisfied with the tip I gave her and she had the nerve to ask for more and said if I didn't have enough on my card, \"you can also give me cash tip.\"  I was like WTF 'cause I've never heard that in my life and she should be lucky she got anything despite the dismal service.  The soup was delicious but I'm not returning! Girl BYE!"}
{"text":"We just got back from vegas.  Just had to try Yelpers recommended beef noodles.  The noodles, beef and soup was so tasty.  It was so good that I cannot describe my feelings.  Definitely I will recommend it to all my friends.  Next trip to vegas will have this on my list."}
{"text":"#1 beef noodle soup is good but not great.  Beef rolls are larger than expected and the wrap has egg which is pretty new to us.  Busy and crowded. We were asked to move table twice and was rushed when we finished."}
{"text":"For a really good bowl of authentic Taiwanese need noodle soup look no further than Noodle Pot in the Chinatown of Las Vegas. It's a small restaurant but always busy. Love the 1/2 meat 1/2 tendon noodle soup and the beef roll is really good too. Don't expect much when it comes to service, they are curt, direct and no nonsense."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst experience's I've had! Customer service was horrible, since I cannot leave the rating zero, I am forced to give them a one, but believe me I wouldn't go back if it was free!    Let me explain, we walked in for a hot bowl of noodles, and the place had maybe 8 tables of people.  We were shown a table and sat down, and that was it, no one came over to take our order, we were there maybe 10 minutes when a bus load of people came flooding through the doors and scrambling for free tables, they were placing orders and their food came flying out, one after another, it was horrific.  I finally got someones attention and they took our order.    Finally, our food came out but they kept pushing us around, first by asking that we move to a single table, we had been seated by them at a table for four, so we complied, then when my husband made his way to the counter to pay, I was still slurping my noodles, they showed people to sit at our table, I wasn't even done eating and they were pushing us out to make room for 'THE BUS' people.  I have never felt so unwanted, I was a paying customer too!  I wanted to sit and enjoy my meal, and yet I was rushed, pushed out of my seat!  I couldn't take it any more, I was livid, so I walked out, disgusted with the whole experience, and I will not go back!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed their beef noodle and beef roll. The beef roll is very unique that they wrapped the beef and cucumber with Taiwanese breakfast egg pancake. I never have something like that before. The reason I'm giving a three stars is because of the pork chop rice. It was very disappointing!  The pork chop was small and very very dry. They used broken rice which didn't go well with the dish. The whole combination of rice, pork chop and side dishes did not taste good together. I would like to come back and try more of their noodle or dumpling dishes and stay away of the rice dishes."}
{"text":"Ambiance: small and family style establishment located in Chinatown   Service: very friendly and considerate   Food: general good   Pig Ear - ** tasted so so   Beef Stew Soup with noodles - **** flavorful soup with chewy noodles, house special, recommend   Price: very decent prices with generous portion"}
{"text":"Good Chinese comfort food spot!  Since the end of Ay-Chung Cafe....this place has the best beef noodle soup that I can find AND they have hand made noodles you can request for an extra $1.  Next to the beef noodle soup...you MUST TRY the Taiwanese beef roll/wrap....nice crispy flour pancake with hoisin flavored beef, cilantro, and some other goodies....I didn't get a chance to dissect this dish since I gobbled it up as soon as it hit the table.    Minus one star since they sometimes run out of certain menu items. The minced pork over rice is also a little skimpy on the meat side, but I'm a hardcore carnivore....also a little heads up....this is another CASH ONLY establishment"}
{"text":"Our first time here, my sister told us about this place.  We had the spicy beef noodle & chives and pork dumplings.  Everything was so yummy, the beef was so tender.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Best beef noodle in town. The chicken with rice is also delicious. The cold cucumber appetizer is yummy. I haven't tried a lot of things on their menu but everything I have tried was good. I make a trip here whenever I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best beef noddles ever I have been looking for the same flavor all over New York and we haven't find any thing as tasty and good as beef stew noodle that is serve in this place."}
{"text":"This place is the best if want authentic Taiwanese spicy beef noodle soup.  They give you a free hot tea with meal.  You know it's good when it's filled with Asian people.  Very cheap also."}
{"text":"Now we need a noodle shop like this in Hawaii!  The broth of but noodles soups were nice and hot. Clean flavors and very good. Service isn't the best but what do you expect from an Asian restaurant where the staff barely speaks english."}
{"text":"It was the busiest noodle shop near 99 Ranch for good reason. The beef stew noodles were tasty.  I've had many noodle soups and the soup here is one of the better ones. Parking is easy and the service was good."}
{"text":"Had beef noodle soup and meatball soup and scallion pancake. All very authentic and delicious. Server is pleasant and fast. Definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Priced right!  Delicious food!  Open late!  Noodle bowls and beef roll were great!"}
{"text":"Perfect place for a bowl of satisfying noodle soup. Haven't been to Chinatown Plaza in ages. I'm glad we stopped by and had dinner here. Friends ordered the famous beef noodle soup while I opted for vegetarian noodles. All enjoyed our dinners."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times because my husband's family is Taiwanese and they like these places when they come into town. If you come on a weekend or at night... WOW WOW WOW. This place is busy. Don't expect an atmosphere where people won't bump into you as you eat or that you'll be able to have a conversation. It is so cramped and you'll be elbow to elbow with strangers (literally, they put 2 of us at a 4 top with another couple because they had run out of room the last time we were here a few weeks ago. Grossed me out because the guy was hacking snot into his napkin and looking at it while we ate.)   This place really needs a bigger location. As is, it's too cramped for comfort. The do take cards now, but you will wait a long time for a seat and the soups are nothing to write home about. I did like that I could substitute out the noodles with a different type as I don't like traditional beef noodle soup noodles."}
{"text":"You know a Chinese place is authentic when they barely speak English. Found in a little nook in Chinatown Plaza, next to the Chinatown Mall, Noodle Pot is one of Las Vegas' hidden local gems. What's the appeal? Good home-cookin'. Their noodle soups and stews taste like Grandma has been slaving away all day in the kitchen so you can enjoy a delicious meal.  Portions are good for the price, although I personally wish it was smaller in size and a dollar or two cheaper. The joint itself is very small and homey, with almost all the patrons speaking exclusively in Chinese. The menu is fairly simple and easy to understand and service is relatively quick and painless.  I like this place enough, but not enough to crave it. The great thing is that their noodles are nicely cooked and I appreciate that they aren't too firm or too soft."}
{"text":"Zero star .......   They have really bad service... Wrong order, bad attitude, even worse, no apology for their mistake.....  And their food are horrible x 5....I will never ever come here again"}
{"text":"I guess apparently if you are not Chinese you get served after everyone else that is and comes in after you. We actually walked out. We were informed that since we didn't ask to be waited on first like the other 10 people did in Chinese, we had to wait. Let me just say F$&@ you. I wish I could a negative star rating. You suck!"}
{"text":"This is what I would call super legit comfort Taiwanese food. Everything from the beef roll to the Taiwanese pork chops and Dan Dan Mian were made well. We ended up rolling on in to this place three or four times during our last visit to Vegas. Also - wow this place is located inside a gigantic Chinatown that I didn't know existed!"}
{"text":"Rude server. Bad service. You should know and plan to be busy on a Thanksgiving weekend."}
{"text":"It is very coarse food that  is rather typical of Taiwanese cooking.  It isn't the best that I had but it is acceptable at US prices.  This place will NEVER survive in LA or other major city.  The support from the community is there but it certainly isn't my first choice when it comes to great Chinese cuisine options available in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I ordered it fry chicken thigh over rice  but the chicken thigh was smoked Kind of like recycle I really didn't like it... but the beef soup dumpling pretty good Their business actually pretty good! And they have a free Wi-Fi  But in Las Vegas I do appreciate it"}
{"text":"For now, just A-OK. I got the beef & tenderloin soup ($8.50) and I did like the tenderloins :). Noodles were okay.   CASH ONLY BTW. Throwing it out there first.  When I was trying to find it, I did not know that it was the main Chinatown plaza. A hole-in-the-wall place right by that Optometrist place. Yeah, I had a little trouble finding it, haha. OOPS. Should've read the reviews more thoroughly!  I'd like to try their beef rolls some other time and maybe some other soup. For now, it's decent enough. Good enough. It's perfect coming at night (opens till 2am on Fri-Sat, and 12am the rest of the week) or when it starts to get cold again.  Worth a try at least once! :)"}
{"text":"I read a review that someone found a bug in their food. I would've eaten that shit! Ok not really but this place is damn good. The beef noodle broth is so warming and deep in flavor, touches you in all the good spots. I'm not sure if the noodles are made in house, they didn't taste like made to order, but definitely super fresh. Beef rolls were solid too. Yum yum."}
{"text":"Ordered a #2 and it wasn't bad!  Soup tasted like it had a lot of MSG.   Come here if you have a hjorrible hungover, greesy and heavy noodle soup cures all!"}
{"text":"Super mom and pop shop, located in the huge Asian complex.  I ordered the beef and tendon noodle soup and it came out soooo quickly, I want to say it was under 5 minutes!   Service was pretty good considering there were basically only two girls serving all the tables and there was one table of guys that were just being absolutely rude and demanding.  Definitely tipped them a bit more just for having to put up with those idiots.   If you're into beef noodle soup, great place to come, they do have little side dishes that you can order as well, I think I might have to come back and try the wontons in chili oil, i keep reading about all the rave! :)"}
{"text":"Perfect place for a casual quick meal.  Place reminds me of my mom's braised beef noodle stew but with homemade noodles.  The place is no frills except for free Wifi (Yay!), so not a place that you'd likely want to take a date to.  Otherwise service is acceptable, they're pretty quick to refill your water and get you anything.  Had to ask for extra napkins.  Located in the heart of Las Vegas Chinatown in the same place as Ranch 99.  The food was really good, so I'll probably go back."}
{"text":"Was craving nul ro mein since it was a cold, rainy weekend in Vegas. I also wanted to get away from the strip for a little bit so ventured over to the \"china town\" all along Spring Mountain. This place got great reviews for their nul ro mein and dumplings so I picked this place.   It's a smaller but cozy mom and pop with friendly servers. Although the hot tea was served in plastic water cups, it was pretty tasty and went perfectly with the meal. Unfortunately, they ran out of the wide noodles for the nul ro mein so I just went for the regular beef noodle soup sinced I didn't want the spice. The broth was light and slightly tangy from the pickled cucumbers. Even though I didn't have the thick noodles, the thin noodles were pretty good. They definitely tasted home made and a slight chew to them which I love. The beef was thinly sliced and somewhat rubbery/chewy - I was definitely not a fan.  Overall, I've had better bowls of noodle soup elsewhere and left slightly disappointed. Then again, I didn't have the spicy beef noodle soup or have the wide noodle either."}
{"text":"It was good. I'm still looking for that Wo hop of NYC Chinatown here in Las Vegas. The soup was filling but lacked a great flavor. I added the chili paste from the table and it was better.   I tried the pork and chive dumplings. They would have been better if they were pan seared. Too much lemon or lime in them. Very strong citrus flavor. Again masked it with the chili paste.   I don't understand the cold plate selections. Especially the tender sliced beef but when in Rome."}
{"text":"Let me preface that anyone who posted a negative review on this restaurant either doesn't know Taiwanese food or isn't Chinese.  My mother is from Taiwan and I visit yearly to see family.  I grew up eating authentic Taiwanese cuisine which is the best Chinese cuisine in the world.  Sorry Hong Kong.  The spicy beef noodle soup is outstanding almost as good as the version in Taiwan which is quite famous. This place reminds me of my mother's home cooking with very traditional dishes.  The beef noodle soup is hearty and rich in beef flavor with succulent beef chunks including tendon, baby bok choy, pickled mustard, cilantro and just perfect noodles.  My favorite appetizer is the beef wrap with thin green onion egg pancake encased around marinated beef slices, cilantro with hoisin sauce.  And you must order the wontons with spicy chili sauce!  Being in Chinatown, service is pretty good and even better if you speak Chinese or Taiwanese."}
{"text":"I had the Taiwanese Beef Noodle. I love that stuff. Came here to eat before leaving LV on the Chinese Bus to LA.  I would be back if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Brrrrrr...... It is super cold night here in Las Vegas (12/07/2013) we're talking mid 20's. Definitely soup weather.  Thanks to yelp, we found one in LV's Chinatown that's highly rated.   Service was very good. Specially accommodating a big group (w/ kids in tow) Food came out fast and the soups come out pipping hot.   Here's some of the rundown.  Beef and Tendon Stew Soup w/ Noodles (Spicy) - the soup was very flavorful, the noodles were perfect, the beef was super tender and delicious. The tendons on the other hand were very very tough. It's a shame, a 5 star soup became very disappointing.   Beef and Tendon Soup w/ noodles (not spicy) my wife's order was the same as my soup. Everything was good except the tendons. My sister in law had the same soup & she had tender tendons. (She got the first bowl) we got ours about 5 minutes after she got hers. I think the tendons were not yet ready. Like my wife said, 10 more minutes of cooking those tendons might have helped, I agree.   Crispy Chicken Leg Rice. Delicious. The chicken had a five spice rub concoction on it and it was fried perfectly. The rice had some mince pork & sauce on it. Yummy. It also came with half a hard boiled egg and a couple of vegi side dish, both very good as well. This dish was for my son, but me and my wife ended up eating the whole thing, sans the chicken skin which my boy scarfed down. I highly recommend this dish.   Everyone in our group enjoyed their meal. The kids specially liked the dumplings.   The hot soup certainly warmed us up at least enough to brave the cold LV night and back to our warm hotel.  I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Our group of 4 came for dinner around 6pm on a weeknight and didn't have to wait at all. We ordered the napa and pork dumplings, 2 x beef and tendon noodle soup, braised pork rice, grilled bok choy, and cold vegetables.   We were pleasantly surprised by how good this Taiwanese place was and very comparable to the Bay Area. The beef and tendon noodle soup was my favorite dish here. It had so many noodles and it was quite chewy and long. The broth was extremely flavorful albeit a bit salty. The cold vegetables were indeed very cold. Tofu, pickled cucumber, and seaweed tasted like it had just been defrosted. Grilled bok choy had plenty of garlic on it  and is a solid vegetable dish.   The amount of food was perfect for 4 people. I'd love to come back here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Location: Noodle Pot is located in a 99 Ranch Market shopping center on Spring Mountain Rd.    Parking: There is ample parking available for its patrons.

Value: mid-priced, not cheap but also not expensive   Diagnosis: return visit approved"}
{"text":"Everything we had was excellent. Beef and tendon noodle, the pig ear salad, pig feet stew, shrimp and chive dumplings and nice service for an Asian place. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Any Taiwanese will tell you, a good bowl of beef noodle soup is hard to come by here in Vegas. So when I keep hearing about this place and finally decided to give it a try, I was not impressed.   Here is what we got:  1. Spicy Beef Noodle Soup with stew beef - it had good flavor but nothing special. our bowl came with some tendons though which was hard to chew.  2. Plain Beef Noodle Soup with flank - very plain taste with random vegetables (almost looked like a bowl of Pho)  3. Sauteed season veggies with garlic - overcooked boy choy, very soggy.  4. Beef Roll - this I will give them credit for, it was pretty tasty, I like the addition of peanuts and egg in here, not your average beef roll. But it was pretty greasy.  The service was friendly and not too busy on a Friday night. But would I come here again? Probably not. You can find better beef noodle somewhere else in my opinion."}
{"text":"I am always in search of a restaurant that serves really good beef noodle soups.  So I was excited to see the interior of this restaurant being put together a few months ago.  I finally came here with another Yelper for dinner and to give their food a try. The restaurant was not busy at all (I was the only in there while I waited for my friend), so service was quick when we placed our order.  I ordered the Beef Noodle with wide noodles $7.99.  The flavor was good,the noodles were chewy the way I like it, but the beef could have been braised longer.  I think China Mama and even Ay-Chung Noodle has better Beef Noodle Soup, so I will likely try something else here in the future.  My friend tried the Babo Mian, which he said was good.  $6.99  We also ordered an appetizer that was on one of the papers taped to the wall. The chicken was good, just a little pricey for the portion.  Overall, I thought the restaurant was decent.  The food was adequate. Price was alright.   WiFi is free, but there is no place to plug in your laptop.  Decor: 3/5  Nothing special.  Just a fast food restaurant kind of furniture and decorations. Food: 3/5  Okay, but definitely room for improvement. Service: 4/5  Efficient. Location:  4/5  In China Town.  Close enough for the tourists staying on the Strip, and locals wanting to eat at a restaurant on Spring Mtn.  Cash only, which my friend said was the reason why he didn't dine here sooner, as he didn't have cash when he initially came here.  I know it is a business decision to process credit cards payments, but it seems that it is a small business expense to cover to not lose potential businesses from those intending to pay with debit/credit cards."}
{"text":"Wow. Food off the Vegas strip is infinitely better than the food on the strip- especially Asian foods!  Noodle Pot takes home the gold for best Taiwanese eats! I really liked their beef rolls, beef stew and pretty much everything on their menu.   Super affordable, easy parking and fast service."}
{"text":"My wife found this place on yelp and it was initially empty so we went next door.  Then one of the business owners from next door said, we always eat lunch there, so we came here.  Food was good by Vegas standards.  The beef burrito was my favorite.  It went well with the chili sauce.   The beef noodle soup was good too.    The other noodles were not bad but not really Taiwanese.  But I still wolfed it down anyways.    Definitely worth a try.  The prices are way better than the strip"}
{"text":"Whenever my Chinese in-laws are visiting from Hong Kong and we go to Chinese restaurants, I am always on the edge of my seat eagerly  awaiting for their opinion (and approval).  I had been here once before and really like it so I added it to the list of places to take them.  Well, I am proud to say that my taste buds were on point because they were big fans of Noodle Pot.    Most of the noodle restaurants in Chinatown are Cantonese style, but Noodle Pot is  traditional Taiwanese style. On both occasions, my husband and I shared the big bowl of the Beef and tendon stew noodle soup.  It is supposed to be spicy, but we also have to add more to appease our spice needs.  The noodles are made from scratch and hand pulled every morning. The beef and tendons are oh so tender, and the broth is bursting with flavor.    I highly recommend ordering the Beef Roll to accompany the noodle soup. The flavor combinations of the egg wrap, the cilantro, thin sliced beef, and hoisin sauce is perfection.  There are also cold dishes (pig ear, marinated cucumbers, seaweed, eggs, peanuts, etc) at the counter to accompany your noodles if you prefer.  In addition, they serve an assortment of dumplings which I have yet to try.   I am also a big fan of the rice dishes.  I ordered a crispy chicken plate for the kids and they loved it.  The steamed rice comes with some minced beef on top and some pickled vegetables on the side. But, the crispy chicken is the true star.   The restaurant is a true hole in the wall. (Our table was next to the freezer).  It may be difficult to find if you can't read Chinese. The Chinese Characters dominate the store front sign but be on the lookout for the tiny square of english words \"Noodle Pot\" in the corner.  The service is quick and friendly, and the flat screen TV is on a Chinese channel.  There are only a few tables inside and it is CASH ONLY, but it is a true GEM to Chinatown."}
{"text":"Love this place, haven't had anything like the flavors that I taste here.   P.S it's always consistent, ever time I have visited it's always delicious"}
{"text":"this place is awesome, I love there food. It's hard to find tho, it's right in the corner of China Town if your facing the parking lot where you drive in it's a small hole in the wall on the lower right corner of the shopping area. I drove past it a few times before finding it and I had to call in and ask whats it near by. I had the beef noodle stew not spicy, really good, and the beef roll thing, it was good also. This stuff is addictive. Be warned."}
