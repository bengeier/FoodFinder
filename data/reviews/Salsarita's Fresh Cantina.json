{"text":"I am just reading these reviews and I have to disagree with them. This was my first time ever having salsaritas and it was pretty delicious and price was good for the portion. My boyfriend and I both got the quesoritto. Let me just say the burritos were so big that the woman making them couldn't even close them. I was happy with this place for my first time ever having it. M only giving them 4 stars only because the floors were really sticky. But their sanitation rating was 100! And was done recently. I know how hard it is to a perfect 100 on that only because I am also in the food industry. But that was it. I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Quick and delish! This is a great lunch spot with daily specials for $5. Even with the line out the door, you get your food quickly. The only challenge is finding a seat, but with the lunch crowd, people eat quickly and leave or get their food to go. Add as many toppings as you want. Drinks are expensive, but you get free refills.

And they are a local Charlotte born chain!"}
{"text":"right across the street from my building and i really like this place. the service is super nice. i had the nachos with the grilled fajita beef. so good. also when im in a hurry or want something \"healthy\" ill just get a side of black beans and rice...add some of their pico and salsa and boom its a fiesta"}
{"text":"The food is ok but the staff is always SO rude. Just ate here and the girl making my burrito just rolled her eyes at me because I dared interrupt her conversation with her coworker (not about work) to ask for sour cream, even though I had already asked. The workers are more concerned about talking to their other coworkers than servicing customers. Had to tell them 3 times it was not a to go order. I feel like they just don't listen at all or pay attention."}
{"text":"This is not a bad place for lunch. I ordered a burrito in a bowl topped with chicken, cheese, salsa, onions, sour cream and parsley. It is very similar to Chipotle, however I still like Chipotle better. 

They have a couple windows seats that has a god street view, making it an ideal spot to people watch."}
{"text":"This place has turned for the worst. The employees don't take pride in their work, the place is filthy and the food was gross. The chips tasted as if they were fried in old grease, the steak was cold and tough. I had to wrap my own burrito into the foil, because the employee didn't bother. I will never come back to this place!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been there in sometime but this was my staple lunch go-to for many many months. It can get crowded and hectic during the lunch hour and when it's cold outside the end of the line will be by the door for sure.
This is the best fast food Mexican I've ever had. So much that when I moved to Chicago I went to the Salsarita's website to ask for one to come to Chicago. Not one here yet. This is so much better than Qdoba and Burrito Beach.
For starters you can eat somewhat healthy here. I used to order 3 hard tacos with shrimp, lettuce, tomato, cilantro, and onion (do this instead of the pico to avoid the added salt) and it was so good. If I had room to splurge in my diet I would add guacamole. When I was having a really crappy day I would get nachos loaded with everything and they would taste amazing.

I don't get to the Queen City much anymore, but when I fly through Charlotte I make sure to go to the one at Douglas airport. Tip: the one in the E concourse has hard shell tacos, the one in the main concourse does not!"}
{"text":"Got a 5.00 small burrito bowl. 

1.50 extra for 'grilled' vegetables that were practically fresh and FAR from grilled that I threw out since I specifically asked for NO green peppers and none of it was cooked. An extra 1.50 for shrimp...got 6 of them in total. 

A little less than thrilled overall. Wish I'd just braved the line at Johnny Burrito...there is a reason there is a line there an not here."}
{"text":"what can i stay?  in the mexican/southwestern semi-fast food heirarchy, you will find salsaritas somewhere in the middle.  not as bad as taco hell, but not as good as moe's or chipotle.  about on par with q'doba.

i usually go with the small steak or burrito bowl to go.  when they make the regular burritos, i think they could stand to drain the scoop of meat a second or two longer so as not to create a mushy mess three minutes into your dining experience.  the combo isn't too bad with a small cup of queso (seriously, i once said cheese instead of queso and got the most quizzical look from the guy) and a drink for about nine bucks.

its not a huge place, nor is it built for comfort, so i tend not to linger.  they have another location in the overstreet mall, and the traffic at this location is much easier to deal with."}
{"text":"Price for dog food is $$ pricey at this want to be  Mexican restaurant and Quality is crap do not recommend to anyone to eat here if you valve your  stomach !!!!!"}
{"text":"Quick service even when they are lined out to the door - which happens frequently around noon every day of the week. Food is good and servers aim to please by fixing everything according to order. Only thing I'd change is the drink station. It's located in a corner and it's difficult for more than one person to be there at one time."}
{"text":"I have ate at Salsarita's a hand full of times. The staff is always welcoming and very polite when I ate there. I have always gotten my food to go, so as far as sanitation rating I am not certain of. I will say that when I am standing there waiting for my food, the food they are prepping always looks clean and fresh. I do think they are a little over priced for what they are, but the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Obviously Salsaritas is a chain but I love this location because everyone is so friendly!!  There is almost always a door-greeter person at lunch that helps keep the dining area clean and pokey-eaters alert.  This is great for group breakfasts and great lunches too!  

It is the one place most of my team likes and we always leave super happy and full!  The best seat at lunch is at the counter to people watch.  Skip the boring chicken (it is much better at Chipotle anyways) and get the el pastor, you wont regret it!  :-D"}
{"text":"$9 for a tiny meatless bowl of veggies, beans, a teaspoon of \"toppings;\" side of a very small bag of chips with a decent size of queso and salsa (no drink). It was okay but I won't go back - much better values elsewhere."}
{"text":"So I love mexican..........and this place is a great lunch place.  Nice selection of food....quick line service and affordable.

Seating is good, though during lunch time it can be crowded.

There is some window seating, so people watching during the lunch time hour can be fun too."}
{"text":"Very average, very fast, always consistent, BUT they offer a rewards card that tallies up points decently fast, so that's a +1.  I'm always impressed at how consistent the food is and how fast the line moves.  2 locations right across the street from each other, and both are packed and both are good.

You can't go wrong with either, but don't expect it to blow your face off."}
{"text":"First let me say that there are two Salsaritas in uptown Charlotte that are less that a half mile apart. One sits in the Overstreet mall and the other sits in the Latta Arcade by The French Quarter. This review is for the Overstreet Mall location. Please note that someone has mistakenly included an exterior picture of the Latta Arcade location on here. 

On to the review... 

This was my first time visiting Salsaritas so I was not entirely sure what to expect since I usually avoid most chain restaurants. Located in the Overstreet Mall, it is convenient to get to if you work uptown like me or if you happen to be visiting for the day. Admittedly, the long line almost made me move on to see what else I could find but since I had some extra time, I decided to wait it out. I discovered that despite the long line, the service is lightning fast so I ended up waiting less than five minutes to get to the counter. I got a taco salad since that was the special for the day. 

Although I am not sure if this is the case with the whole menu, I was able to pick whether I wanted chicken, ground beef or steak and then I had a massive amount of toppings to choose from. Everything looked very fresh which is a must for me. There was no brown lettuce, soggy tomato, or sour cheddar cheese. The taco salad was pretty good and I think I would have it again. 

There was plenty of seating and I wouldn't have minded eating my lunch there if I was not by myself. Still, since I was on my own for lunch I got everything to go. I was really surprised that they packed my taco salad in a huge box specially made for my meal. The box probably cost more than my entree! lol... Anyway, I was in and out with decent food. 

If you are in a hurry and want a more substantial lunch, I would recommend Salsaritas. I think that the wait to get my food was quicker than if I had gone to the Chickfilet that sits right across the hallway."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Salsarita's and their ability to give you a quick lunch that doesn't result in a form of a sandwich.  This location is off of Tryon, right across the street from the Wells Fargo Plaza.  There are large windows in the front so you can look out onto the street... usually there are cars parallel parked on the street, so it's not much of a view, but at least it is a change in scenery for lunch (rather than staring at a computer screen or cubicle wall).

The staff at this location are friendly and efficient.  They even clear your tray for you as a courtesy if they see you are finished.

As with all things Uptown, they make use of the space and sometimes the line can wrap around the dining area if you hit it at the wrong time.  But even with a line, it moves fairly fast and you can get your burrito, nacho, quesadilla fix whenever you want to.

There is the main street entrance, but there is also a back entrance in the hallway of the Latta Arcade... you do have to pass by the restrooms in the back entrance, but it is usefull if you don't want to walk out into the elements or are trying to save time by cutting through the building."}
{"text":"Got the quesarito which looks delicious,but everything inside was cold and flavorless. My lunch mate's reviewed the guacamole as \"tastes like something but not guacamole. \". The chips had almost no salt. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Middle of the road Mexican fare served VERY quickly.  At least at this Uptown location where the lunch line blazes along.  Middle of the road isn't a bad thing in this case, just exactly what you would expect from a semi-fast food Mexican place with these prices.

I generally stick to two things when ordering.  Crispy Tacos with shredded pork or the Nachos with seasoned ground beef.  With the tacos, eat them quickly or the crispy shells get un-crispy quickly.  For the nachos, whatever you do, don't look up the nutritional info on the website or they will be difficult to enjoy.  if you're into pain/guilt  though, go and just plug in \"chips\", no other ingredients, and see what the calorie counter shows. For basically any dish, you get choices of salsa (go hot!), beans, rice, queso, cilantro, sour cream, guacamole, etc, etc...

End of the day if you want to leave cube-ville Uptown, don't have much time and want to get filled up with some vaguely Mexican flavored food, Salsarita's is your go to."}
