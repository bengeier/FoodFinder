{"text":"Tried them for the first time and I have to say they are pretty good. Got pizza and cheesy bread sticks and both were good. Their sauce is what makes this pizza. I would definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Their Italian Hoagie is fantastic!  I really enjoy their pizza, you can tell they have a unique sauce they make, very peppery, but good!  Their crust is what made me come back.  It's so delicious!  
I've had their white pizza, ordered it without Ricotta.  The flavor was very bold.  
Their Italian Calzone was filled with lots of meats and cheese and super delicious. 
Always have very nice customer service and delivery."}
{"text":"This is my first ever review. I'm not one to comment, but I'm just so happy there's finally a quality pizza place that delivers to me!  I live in Richland and all the good mom & pop places have closed. I don't care for the chain restaurants. The crust was thin and had a nice flavor. The sauce was quality and had the perfect amount. This is my new pizza shop!  Yay!"}
