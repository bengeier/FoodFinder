{"text":"East Coast Wings just opened in The Shoppes at Hanfield.  It's in the shopping center with Publix and I went there yesterday for their opening.  Had the Little Dipper sliders and they were awesome.  Has roast beer, cheese and slaw with a fabulous aus ju for dipping.  Highly recommend it.  The fries were great as well and the service was top notch."}
{"text":"They just opened this week at this location.  I went yesterday and ordered wings to go for lunch for my family.  The service was great.  They were very friendly and the food came out within 15 minutes.  I ordered the coco mango wings.  They were so good, we went back for dinner and had the same exact thing.  LOL.  At dinner, they were slam packed with people and super busy. They still had excellent service and the food came out again within 15 minutes. They were overwhelmed with people but still handled the crowd so graciously.  Looks like they will do well at this location."}
{"text":"Great food and plenty of craft beers on tap. I am glad that they opened one near my area. Now I know where to go on Game day."}
