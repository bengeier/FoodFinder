{"text":"We had dessert and coffee and can't find much to rave about.  The food and coffee were merely okay, and the place was very loud.  Not bad, but nothing remarkable in our one experience."}
{"text":"If you view this place as a bar, then it's very good, as previous reviewers have described.  Excellent views, libations, and people watching.

But the restaurant aspect is much flimsier.  The food menu fits on one small sheet (4 paninis, 5 mains, and 5 salads).  The mains come without sides, which you need to order separately.  I've tried the halibut and roast potatoes, finding them OK but nothing exciting.  The dessert menu offers a bit more variety, though I haven't had any.

On this particular night, the waiters were slow; I sat at my table for 10 minutes before the waitress came by.  But this may have been an exception, judging from other reviews.  Everyone was definitely pleasant, polite, and cheerful, so that's a big plus.

All in all, I give it three stars as a compromise.  It's an excellent waterlooking watering hole and a mediocre restaurant.

Tip #1: Entrance is from the outside facing the water.  It's hard to reach from inside the mall, and you end up going outside anyway.

Tip #2: Remember to order some sides with your main."}
{"text":"Awesome!  Why? The BEST views: people watching, few feet from waters' edge & boardwalk, ships, ferries, Toronto Island & Airport.  

2 tiered patio.  Street level is tables, upper level is cozy benches with pillows and blankets for the cool breezes when not July or August.

Our server was efficient, freindly & very prompt.  She was always willing to bring a taste test of any wine, with a good 1oz + pour (not a drip which evaporates by the time it comes to your table at alot of places).

It was a perfect summer day, but quite chilly with the wind.  But the huge wrap-around blankets took care of any discomfort!  

Flatbreads were yummy and so was the bruschetta.  Had a crisp & cold bottle of savignon blanc, then moved onto some red to warm up :-)

It was a perfect Sunday afternoon to visit while in Toronoto.  I can't think of a more perfect, romantic thing to do!!"}
{"text":"This is a bar/restaurant on the harbor (or harbour, for the natives), connected to El Fornello restaurant next door.  

We just had one drink here, so can't comment on the menu, but had the best seats in the house for people, plane, and lake watching on a gorgeous--if chilly--day.  I loved that we could sit on the curvy wooden benches outside, even though it was less than 50 degrees out.  Just bundled up in the soft blankets that were strewn about and enjoyed the sunshine and a HUGE glass of Stella. 

A perfect spot for an afternoon drink or snack, just a short walk down the lakefront from our hotel."}
{"text":"great food and drinks. The view of the harbour front is amazing. The patio's are always packed in the summer time. They have the best Kobe Burgers in Toronto and awesome margaritas."}
{"text":"Lusso is a great spot for a drink down by the lake on a steamy summer evening. The temperature always seems about 10 degrees cooler than the core, even though it is only a few blocks away. Don't worry as the night progresses they will come around with warm blankets for those that get chilly.

Their martini list hasn't changed much since it was Lago years ago. They have a good selection of original drinks, making it a stand out spot among the row of restaurants down on the boardwalk.

The food is also pretty tasty, although I can only speak for the Lamb and some of their appetizers. If you want a real hearty meal, I would go next door to Il Fornello, but for drinks and apps Lusso is the spot.

Fair warning, they shut down around midnight on weekdays, so prepared to get the boot if you get too cozy while enjoying their special cocktails and the view over the water."}
{"text":"I had low expectations given the touristy Harborfront area, but Lusso was lovely!

The patio was really romantic, the bellinis were delicious, and the sangria looked mighty tasty, too. Plus the hostess was cute as a button and our server was really cool and made good recos.  I must say the service was also quite efficient for such a busy waterfront location.


The mixed greens and avocado salad plus the sauteed vegetables were perfectly savory, lightly spiced, and anything other than boring. I munched down to the last decorative frisee.

The enigmatic piece de resistance  was a beet torta-- you read it right: BEET, not beef. Imagine baked red risotto cakes pressing layers of crispy chard and crinkly bok choy, all topped with a pungent mushroom cream sauce. Yum! I can't promise, but it looked to be gluten-free and almost vegan. And every bit as satisfying as a meaty pasta dish.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Well to begin with, there is no such restaurant as Lusso. It is actually a cafe-sized dependency of the \"Il Fornello\" restaurant - they share menu and bills, and apparently the kitchen as well.

If you have been to Il Fornello, there is no need to describe their food. If you haven't, good for you. Small portions of something \"Italian-like\", with main plates being the worst, pastas slightly better and pizzas a no-no. Menu is short and wine list is nothing to brag about.

This place is also in a \"$$$\", not \"$$\" price range (we've left $370 there yesterday for a rather unremarkable dinner for four - appetizers, three bottles of wine, dessert/coffee finishing). Wines on a bill looked about twice the price then on the menu.

Servers are friendly, though not hesitating a second to seat you at the table just wiped with a wet cloth, or put an empty glass on a menu you have left on the table.

I called them an hour in advance to book a table at 6:30, and was reassured that the place is empty so I can just drop in (hmm). When we did, the place was full and their only table seating four - the one on the way to the washrooms - was occupied.

Again, that is a cafe-sized place - one table seating four, three tablets for two and two cozy booths. That is as much space as you get. Plus an open \"patio\" or rather a veranda adjacent to the quay' sidewalk.

Oh, and if you dream about an unobstructed lake view, be sure to tow away all the ships docked in front of the place, otherwise there will not be that much to look at...

Personally, my first time at Lusso was good enough to never return."}
