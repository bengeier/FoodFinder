{"text":"I visited this restaurant because I noticed it had a 4.5 star rating on Yelp. Also because they serve a type of spicy pho called Beef Satay that I've never heard of before. This soup totally blew my mind in every way possible, the broth had an amazing depth of flavor and a perfect level of spice that permeated all of the other ingredients. I cannot get this soup where I live in the United States, I'm so bummed. The shrimp salad rolls were also super fresh, the restaurant was very clean, and the service was top notch. Don't miss the opportunity to eat here, it's an absolute gem!!! 6 Stars if possible!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Saigon Red Sky a number of times since it opened a year ago, and my opinion of the food, service and atmosphere has remained unchanged. It is simply one of the best locally owned Vietnamese treasures I have had the pleasure of visiting.  The restaurant is located in a very tiny space in a non-descript strip mall in an area of the city that is sadly lacking in notable eateries. The owners have taken great care to make the space welcoming and charming. A large part of the welcoming atmosphere is the friendly treatment you receive from the moment you enter the restaurant. The owners do all of the cooking and serving. They are attentive without being intrusive. The service is quick, and the food arrives hot and delicious.  I have tried a number of Vietnamese restaurants in the city, and have often wondered about the condition of some of the kitchens. Not so here. I haven't seen many places that are cleaner."}
{"text":"Great food. Would recommend for those that like Vietnamese food. Tasty dishes and excellent customer service. Can't believe it took me a while to come across this. Get some!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Open for 4 Years this little spot always has consistent flavors, quick service and friendly owners.  Great table Turn over ensures a quick seat, and a solid simple menu.   I have many favorites in the city, but this is my go-to!"}
{"text":"Quality ingredients and food prepared quickly.  Tastes fresh and authentic.  Best Vietnamese restaurant in town,"}
{"text":"Place is pretty good, I would recommend trying it out if you are in the area and feel like Asian food."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Vietnamese. The food is fresh and service is friendly. We love the sate soup which is a bit different than the typical sate soup - not peanutty. The best part about this place is that cilantro isn't automatically put in everything - which for people who can't stand cilantro, but don't have the memory to request it not be put in is amazing"}
{"text":"I'm in Calgary every other week for business and I eat here everytime. This is by far my favourite vietnamese resturaunt. They are a family run business with great food and great service. They put a lot of pride into their food and business which really shines through! I highly recommend this resturaunt and can't wait until I can eat here again. The ingredients and cuts of meat are top notch unlike other similar resturaunts I have eaten at. The resturaunt is very clean and washrooms immaculate."}
{"text":"I was on my way to Pho Thanh and I spot a sign - a new Vietnamese restaurant just opened up.  Since it's only 2 mins away from my original destination, I figured - meh why not.  Oh wow...I'm first to review this place!  Sweet.  It's a nice, cozy place.  Looked more like an Italian restaurant than a Vietnamese but it doesn't matter.  It's clean and it had jazz music going so good enough for me.  In any new Vietnamese restaurant, I always start off with the usual order - Pho satay and spring rolls.  If they can't these 2 things right, they'll never see me again.  The spring rolls was nice and hot...and greesy!  Just the way I like it.  The Satay was familiar.  It reminded me of Saigon Y2K.  I had to ask the owner.  So apparently, he owned Saigon Y2K in downtown!  Aha..I knew it!  Anyways, he sold Y2K and opened Saigon Royal in Douglasdale and then sold that and opened this joint.  Well he did good.  I've always liked Saigon Y2K back when I was working in downtown.    Food = 2 stars Would I come back = sure, 1 star Atmosphere = 1 star     Price = $34 for 2 bowls, ice coffee, and spring rolls....steep?  yeah a lil' but that's average.  0 star"}
{"text":"I have eaten here about a dozen times and had take out before too. This place never disappoints.  The service is very friendly, the rest itself is very clean and the food is always Fresh.  Their Satay Beef is awesome and definitely one of the top choices for me."}
{"text":"I went to try this place because its close to my house and because of the good ratings here. I do think this place is overrated. My sate beef pho had very little kick to it and the broth was bit bland  for a Pho. I ordered a regular but found very little meat . My friend had a vermicelli bowl w grilled beef, shrimp and spring rolls and they were pretty disappointing too . Beef was chewy and spring rolls just had mostly carrot. Maybe an off day Im not sure but with other viet restaurants in the area I prob wont be back here again."}
{"text":"Lucky to come across wonderful Vietnamese food on way to the airport. Great food and that's compared to Vietnamese food from our hometown of Southern California where there are tons of Vietnamese restaurants. Excellent pho and great service"}
{"text":"We saw this restaurant while in the area and made it a point to try it out.  Girlfriend said it was the best veggie spring rolls she'd ever had.  Hers was a veggie spring roll/vermicelli.  Mine a grilled pork/regular spring roll/vermicelli.  Was absolutely delicious!  Sauce was without chillis by request, and server made sure we were absolutely taken care of.  Jazz music in the background.  No vietnamese subs, but the goal of this place is great service and dine in.  Will be back for sure.  Previous review mentioned Saigon Y2K, and it was confirmed because it came up in conversation.  If subs were available to-go we'd go nowhere else.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Newly opened and a nice treat. Restaurant was very clean, nice background music, fast service, the prices were reasonable and the food was Great!  I especially liked the atmosphere created. The server was very friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"I am from Hamilton Ontario, where there are a lot of Vietnamese restaurants.  Finding one in Calgary, I was a little apprehensive at first.   It is located in a humble strip mall, and parking was very easy.  Inside was very clean, and the owner who served us was very warm, friendly and attentive.  The food was very delicious.  No fatty meats, well seasoned and fresh vegetables.  Very clean inside and nice small touches like individual dipping sauces when you order rolls for the table.  This is a must stop restaurant in Calgary for me now."}
{"text":"I just moved into the area, and was taken to this place by someone who said I just moved right by the awesome Vietnamese restaurant. Man, were they right.   This place has probably one of the most flavorful and spiciest sate pho I have ever had. Even though it is in a strip mall, you walk in and it's a nice classy place. They play jazz music and have a nice chill vibe. It even has a tv so I can watch the game, or just check it from time to time depending who I'm with.   It is definitely at the top of my list, and being walking distance from it, I will be here all the time!"}
{"text":"Unbeknownst to myself, I began a subconscious quest to find the perfect pho sate and Red Sky was my first stop. This is a favourite go to for a few friends of mine, and when they asked me to meet here for lunch, my first reaction was \"There's a pho place in Beddington?\" Yes, yes there is. It is in the same strip mall as Senoire's (aka home of the most delicious donair pizza that ever existed), so it wasn't hard to find (although parking is another story)  This place is very small (they can fit maybe 20 people in here comfortably), but it is really clean and the staff are super friendly.   After snacking on some spring and salad rolls, our bowls of pho came out. Even though I went with a small, there was more than enough for me to eat. The sate was not overpowering with spiciness, it really complemented the savoury beef broth (that wasn't laden with MSG which is always a huge plus) and there was a good portion of noodles and beef flank - seriously, how did this all fit in small bowl?  I've gone back to Red Sky a few times since, dabbled in noodle and rice dishes but I always go back to the pho sate - I think it's their best dish"}
{"text":"Have been in Calgary for over 15yrs and this is by far the best Vietnamese restaurant we have encountered in the last 5yrs.  Very fresh, authentic and fast!  This is a hidden gem, great job we will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here on the way to Banff from the Calgary airport. Found it on Yelp hehe. This is a nice cozy Vietnamese place. Nothing really jumps out as being extraordinary, but the prices are slightly steeper than one might see in other cities. Good spot to get that nice bowl of pho you are craving."}
{"text":"We loved Saigon Red Sky! The owner was very nice, he was serving us and tended to our cups constantly.  The place is small, and it is almost hidden in a tiny small stripped mall.  We ordered pork egg rolls... they were amazing! Lots of carrots, you can tell they were definitely made fresh in-house.  We thoroughly enjoyed our vermicelli bowls. The portions were generous, I was super hungry, I finished my bowl clean, but my bf didn't.   Note: They only serve BEEF broth pho, no chicken."}
{"text":"Great pho, great atmosphere and great family/staff running the show. Try #32, the curry beef pho is to die for! Sat√© here is very spicy as well. Good stir fry and curry options for vegetarians as well!"}
{"text":"Very friendly owner and the sate beef pho was great. The Vietnamese spring rolls were really great too. I ordered takeout for all of these items and was surprised to see that I didn't have to ask for a single extra thing ( fork , chopsticks, sauce etc) also the packaging was very sturdy."}
{"text":"This place is tucked into a strip mall but so good. The Pho is so tasty and flavourful. The vermicelli bowls are so yummy. My goto for Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Had the seafood soup bowl and basil spring rolls (served with a peanut sauce) which were prepared well and tasty. For the purpose of a decent weekday dinner I can certainly recommend it."}
{"text":"I decided to try Red Sky since it is under a five minute drive from my house.   The first thing I noticed was the friendly atmosphere, the owner greeted me and my girlfriend at the door. The service was excellent in every aspect which in my experience can be lacking at some Pho restaurants.   The food was top notch especially for the price, the owner was willing to let my girlfriend try a number of sauces free of charge since she is relatively new to Vietnamese food.  I highly recommend Red Sky, try it you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Have been eating at Saigon Red Sky since the very first day it opened...and continue to go back almost weekly.  Since its so close to home its nice, but the food and service would be worth the drive even if it wasn't so close.    Have tried a few things, between myself and my family, haven't found anything we don't like and wouldn't have again.  Everything is fresh and you can tell.    The owner also serves and checks in on you regularly...its a nice little shop with a great atmosphere and a tv too for if you want to watch the hockey game.    Will keep going back as the price is competitive with all the others in the area, has great service and even better food."}
{"text":"My friend and I were quickly greeted by the owner of the restaurant in a very friendly and accommodating manner, we were able to sit ourselves anywhere we wanted in the restaurant (well it was empty besides one table finishing up their meal).  I quickly took a look around the place has some decent decor, it's inbetween the too fancy Pho restaurants and the not enough Pho restaurants I couldn't complain much about the looks - it was thought out.  Quickly going through the menu they have the items of most typical Vietnamese restaurants. As usual, my go-to item the Pho Tai Bo Vien. The reason why I always get this particular item is because I can test out their beef, their beef balls, their pho noodles and as usual the most important thing the broth.  I was really satisfied with my order, the regular size is big enough to be filling but not overly big to be uncomfortable -- here they use smaller bowls so the broth is about a cm from the top of the bowl, lots of noodles, plenty of beef and plenty of beef balls for my tastes.  The broth was not too bland but not too rich either basically right in the middle -- I thought it could be a tiny bit richer but for most people eating I think it would be okay taste wise.  Not much else to complain about! I'm definitely putting this place on my Pho Sho List as if I am in the area it's a good place to hit up if you want an alternative to Pho Thanh Noodle House."}
{"text":"Great spot in the NW, satay soup was great.  Atmosphere was awesome.  We even had our 18 month old with us and they were very welcoming.  I will go again, without a doubt.  You should give it a shot!"}
{"text":"On a Saturday I decided to swing by for some take out. I ordered the lemon chicken. My order was ready really quick. However, I have to say that it was not one of the better Vietnamese meals I've had. First of all, it looked completely unappetizing, no color, ick! And there was not much flavor. It was as if they boiled the chicken then dipped it in some lemongrass flavor. This was a complete let down and I'd not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This place was great! Large portions and delicious food. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fast and tasty food make this a fine choice for Vietnamese Takeout. A comfortable, clean and intimate atmosphere with friendly staff make this a fine choice for a dinner out in Beddington.  Saigon Red Sky is you typical Vietnamese restaurant, except everything is a touch nicer. Along with Buddha statues and other Vietnamese trinkets and you might find elsewhere, Saigon Red Sky has put a bit more thought into the overall look. Lighting chosen for an intimate diner atmosphere instead of fluorescents. Art work on the walls over the tables. Tables and chair that all look like they were purchased at the same time in an attempt to give the place a look. It's by no means The Ritz, but it looks like they've at least put some thought into your dining experience as well as the food.  I'm not incredible at telling the subtle nuances of one Vermicelli bowl to the next, but what they brought me, I enjoyed. Fresh tasting ingredients, plenty of fish sauce, a container of hoisin sauce for me to dunk everything in. I really liked the meatballs that accompanied the shrimp, spring roll and grilled pork in my Saigon Red Sky Vermicelli Special (#60) - sort of like a Vietnamese chorizo. Delish!"}
{"text":"We love good Vietnamese food, and we come here often. The ambiance is wonderful, low-key, quiet with great jazz music in the background. They had accommodated our youngest family members with special children's plates, high chairs and booster seats. We older ones love the jazz, the quick courteous service and the personal touch of the owner. We have picked this place as our favorite Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"Great Authentic Vietnamese food, great service, decent price. From time to time I would come here for a quick lunch before work or pick up a take out going to work. It is great every time. Thanks!"}
{"text":"We had a bad experience a while back with the service at this restaurant.  One member of our party was late and For some reason the server/owner wouldn't let us order prior to the arrival of the last member.  As a result, another member of our party had to leave without eating anything as he had another commitment to go to.  We explained to the owner that one of us had to leave early and he still wouldn't let us order for some strange reason.  This is really bad customer service when you cannot reasonably accommodate your customer.  Needless to say, we have not been back to this place ever since this encounter.  We have been bringing our business to Lac Viet down the street at Centre Street ever since."}
{"text":"So I started coming here about 2 months ago. I was on lunch, and I knew that my regular Pho place would be packed at the time, so I was driving down the street and saw the sign.  The exterior is quite misleading. At first glance, you would think the restaurant is a run down hole in the wall. Once you get inside, you are pleasantly surprised: soothing jazz music, leather chairs, decorative lights and wall decor.  The server was friendly, we exchanged regular banter, and he took my order. I ordered the Red Sky vermicelli and an Vietnamese iced coffee. The food came out quickly, and was a generous serving of spring rolls, meatballs, grilled pork, and vegetables, all served over thin rice noodles. It was delicious, very filling, and the coffee was a great way to keep me from falling into a food coma.   All in all, a great restaurant that isn't too busy for lunch. I have since brought a number of coworkers and they also have enjoyed!"}
{"text":"Definitely come back. Would have taken pictures but we ate it before we could. We had #34 and #22, the spicy beef pho and the chicken pho, the best we've ever had. Great place, nice and clean. We also had the vegetable salad spring rolls, gone super fast."}
{"text":"I have tried pho at a number of different places.  Every place I go, I usually seek out a pho place to see what they are like.  I thought I'd try Saigon Red Sky.  Nice little place, very pleasant staff and very attentive.  The other yelp reviewers were correct about that.   Saigon Red Sky is definitely a clean place to eat at (my experience is that many other pho places fail at cleanliness).  The small place had some Billie Holiday playing and some sports on the TV (muted).  Nice atmosphere.    Being the first time I was here, I ordered my stand-by pho... Sate/Satay/ or how ever you spell it.  It was good.  Nothing outstanding.  I've had better, and I've certainly had worse.  As I was the only person in the restaurant, the service was pretty attentive.  So I can't say what it would be like if it was busier.  The soup was brought out quickly, it was very hot and had good flavours.    I'll go back if I'm in the area.   I gave this place 4 stars, but only because of the cleanliness and the attentive/friendly staff.  Food was average, but good value."}
{"text":"Great spring rolls, probably the best cafe sua da (Vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk) in Calgary. And awesome customer service by owner named Hawk. Definitely a must to try!"}
{"text":"Love love love, always a pleasure to eat here - order out, great prices and fantastic service!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine lives in SW Calgary and she drives a solid 45min to eat here.  Based on this craziness, I figured I should join her one day.  It really is a great little place with unexpected background music.  Jazz!  Talk about a nice change.  What stood out the most for me was the peanut sauce for the spring rolls.  It's the best I've ever had.  I don't know if they whip it or what the secret is, but I will return just for that.  I was also surprised by how eclectic the patrons were, and not in a bad way.  Don't let the exterior turn you off."}
{"text":"We're from California and came to visit for Banff, and before heading out wanted to try pho in another city.   We weren't sure if this is consider good pho for Calgary, but came because we saw great reviews. The pho was okay. The broth was waaay to sweet. Like super sweet. If they took out the sweetness it could be good pho. But it was decent. Meat and noodles were good. Big portion, pricing just right. The spring rolls were sad, very thin and had no substance. Veggie were at least fresh.   The server was very friendly and helpful though. The place was small and clean. It's a nice change (friendly service and clean) for a pho place!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night, I had the Chicken with celery and carriots over rice. My wife and Chicken in a soup.....both were EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"I live near 17th and I am pretty loyal to my Vietnamese place, but while working up in the NW I'm always looking for new places to get some veggie pho.  Other yelp reviews pointed me here, saying it was the spiciest satay pho they've had which excited me.  It was good! A bit beef-like in taste, but the soup was spicy and exactly what I ended to clear my sinuses and it was cheap!   They were super fast, friendly and my gentleman friend said his food (spring rolls and Vietnamese coffee) was great also.  Definitely worth a second try I think. An alternative to buying a bag of carrots and a coffee on my lunch break is always welcome!"}
