{"text":"I have gone to this place twice now and had different experiences both times. My first time was great. The food, ambience, and service was exceptional. However the second was the total opposite. Upon arriving into the restaurant 45 minutes before closing, we were told we cannot order through the menu and can only eat the buffet. As it looked quite good we gave it a try. The buffet was alright 6/10. However, 2 families arrived just 15 minutes before closing and the owner decided to let them order from the menu, while we were only given the option to eat at the buffet. I did not think this was fair at all nor did my friend. Due to my second experience I will not be returning to Masala Bites."}
{"text":"This tiny lil'corner came about as a pleasant surprise. I took home biryani thinking another similar taste..but, when I had it oh boy it blew me away..the taste was amazing. Thought I ordered right outta Mumbai..
I Will be going back for more.."}
{"text":"We got the most unwelcome gesture when we showed up, despite the fact that we called and reserved before coming. The restaurant was completely empty from the time we entered till the time we left, but the manager told us that all the tables are reserved and we have to sit on a table that is close by the door - not comfortable. 

They made us felt as if they were doing a favor by letting us pay & eat. Rude behavior will not take them further in this business.

Also, don't understand WHY other folks have rated high as the food was very ordinary in taste, very oily and spicy (not in a tasty way). It is not that we can't stand the heat of spicy food, it is just that some spicy food just taste delicious and others cause stomach ache. 

Hope this review is helpful and you save yourself from this food  & service."}
{"text":"Food is okay, nothing too spectacular. 

We had ordered two paneer curries and daal. I felt it did lack flavour especially when compared to traditional food served in many places.

I wouldn't recommend it to anyone specifically. I guess if you're in the vicinity and want average Indian food, then this place isn't bad. I wouldn't drive out to go there."}
{"text":"Good food , had buffet and prices are good. Place is small and buffett could use more variety but it was tasty for most part. The staff was friendly and thats always refreshing (one extra star just for that).  But otherwise find it similar to other small indo/pak joints in area"}
{"text":"What a great experience. We ordered the tandoori platter, gol gappe, different kind of naans, chicken lababdar, chicken and paneer pakore. The food was tasty and we kept on ordering more and more haha. Above all the owner/host was great and friendly and inviting even though they were closing soon. Had a great time."}
{"text":"Average food ...that is all. May or may not go there again. Have noticed that color has been added to every thing. Nice presentation and good customer service."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants I've ever tried. The food is amazing, the restaurant is very clean and comfortable. The service is EXCELENT! the owner makes sure everything is perfect! This place is a must for Indian food!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for getting good quality Indian food. I have been there twice for their lunch buffet and was very satisfied with food. They have good number of entries and sweets (generally 3-4) for desserts. The place is small from outside but clean inside. The staff was good. Overall, I would recommend this place if you are looking for good quality Indian food."}
{"text":"Love Masala Bites, it's my go-to Indian food place. It's affordable and the owners are really nice."}
{"text":"We went to this place today after searching for a best restaurant in Mississauga. This place came on the top and i was doubtful if it will be like a take away place. However we thought of taking a chance. Dono how we missed this place for last 9 months. Everything we ordered was amazing. Tandoori chicken, chili chicken and  afghan chicken were outstanding.we will definitely come back frequently to this place. If you live around, don't miss this place, you will regret.

Update: I missed to say about the service, service was excellent too."}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious, in a clean environment, surprised us with courteous and exceptional customer service. A perfect place to treat your boss for Christmas lunch. 
Try goat curry with fresh naans, buffet had perfect selection. A suggestion, please add chicken boti, for kids.  
Indian sweets we perfect, and fresh. Well done guys. See you soon."}
{"text":"Was working on a Saturday and so picked up food on my way home around lunch time. Got a couple chicken dishes, veggie rice and naan. Food was ok, definitely not authentic Indian as they claim. 
The chilli chicken gravy was very tasty but the pieces of chicken tasted like they were just boiled and thrown into the gravy, same with the sweet peppers, just cut and added to the gravy. The rice was ok, again nothing special.
Disappointed as not value for money spent at all, they need to improve the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Had lunch take out today, all I can say is their food is fantastic !! Consistent in taste, we ordered the Marsala tikka chicken, naan and spicy chick peas. Potions are reasonable and taste is just amazing. Well done !!!! I will keep on coming back, oh and service is always a pleasure there."}
{"text":"Only place which serves what it's name says...Masala Bites. Amazing food, we had a buffet and it consisted of over 5 gravy dishes in veg and 5 in non veg. Trust me this place actually provides each dish with uniques flavour. None is its curries taste the same. Their naan are freshly made and are by far the softest naan I ever had. Garlic naan is not included in the buffet but it's totally  worth to have it on the side. I actually don't  have a sweet tooth but I ended up eating 4 gulab jamuns....it was the best of my meal today. Hope they open a new branch here in Toronto downtown. Before I forget to mention .....the cleanliness maintained here is commendable. If I were to score them of their cleanliness it would be 10/10. 
Great work guys hope to visit you more often from now."}
{"text":"First off there are not enough stars to use rate this restaurant, my boyfriend and I absolutely love their Chicken Tikka Masala, Rice & Garlic Naan. The texture of the Masala is on point and taste is perfection. We have been to many Indian restaurants even out of province and none of them can compare to Masala bites. To top it off the service is impeccable. This is owned by Husband and Wife and they are very accommodating, pleasant and attentive. We have now become regulars of this restaurant, and would drive in bad weather conditions just to eat here. Hope this review helps you all when deciding the best Indian food in the GTA.

{"text":"Was seriously craving Indian food and stumbled upon this place when seeing what was around in Mississauga. Let me say this was probably one of the best Indian buffet I've ever been to! Plus for AYCE dinner for $18 really can't be beat!

Came on a Monday night around 830. The restaurant is quite small, maybe seats 50 max? Service was prompt and we were seated right away and was offered some freshly made naan which was the best naan I've had. Warm and buttered to perfection. Mmm 

Considering it was closing at 10, the food selection was still plentiful. There was a vegetarian side for hot foods and meat dishes on the other. I was so hungry and tried everything. 

Omg the curries... So flavorful!!! Usually I'm a huge fan of just having butter chicken but I couldn't resist everything else they had to offer. The lamb curry was pretty spicy tho if you're not used to spicy foods. 

They didn't have too many desserts. The rice pudding was all done by the time I got around to it. But I was already satisfied with my dinner. 

Can't wait to go back the next time I'm craving Indian food."}
{"text":"Excellent quality, good prices, nice atmosphere, highly recommend it, one of the best Indian restaurants I've been to in the GTA!"}
{"text":"Got food poisoning...

I am not sure where all these good reviews are coming from. We went on a weekend for buffet dinner.

The main course food was decent- except the tandoori chicken which was dry and tasteless. For dessert we got some melon- to my shock when I tried it, the fruits tasted ROTTEN. We pointed this our to the server, who apologized, but did not remove the tray where the fruits came from.

If you want a garlic naan they charge 2$ on top for EACH SLICE.

We ended up paying $50 before tip for 2 people- which is EXPENSIVE for an Indian food place.

What happened after is the bad pafrt- both me and my boyfriend got sick from the food- upset stomach and neaseau for 2 days. 

The only nice thing about this place is service- the waiter was very attentive and fast.

Needless to say, we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Wanted to try authentic Indian food with a buffet style as I am a newbie to this type of food. Greeted by the staff and they made me feel right at home. The food was delicious, buffet style was great to try a little bit of everything and then get more of what I liked most. It was very fresh and exceptionally clean. The overall atmosphere with the calming music, lighting and the kind staff made this a great experience. Found my Indian food go to spot!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good keeping in mind this is a buffet place.They do serve both menu and buffet option, but I think buffet is the way to go here.

I came with family and made earlier reservation as the place is a little small. They had many veg and non veg dishes.Fresh naan keeps coming to your table so you don't have to worry about that!

The owner was there and was very friendly in serving us and the cashier was quite friendly too. There might me a lot of Pakistani and Indian restaurant in the area but this place does deserve a try. 

Overall, Good Place many choices of dishes, plenty of parking and good service.

For my Muslim peeps! They serve halal."}
{"text":"Service - 4 star
Food - 3 star
Price - 4 star
The service was pretty good. Food was okay, nothing to rave about. Naan was good, pretty big and fluffy and crisp at the same time. Kadai Paneer was OK, a little salty for our taste. They tried to fix it but didn't make much difference. 
Gol gappa was good. 
There are so many Indian places in Mississauga, we probably won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Very pleasant dining experience. Friendly staff, fast service. Food was excellent. Dinner for two, including appetizer was around $50. Good price for indian restaurant. Would recommend to friends."}
{"text":"We went for their lunch buffet last week, I chose this place based on Yelp reviews.
We really, really enjoyed our lunch.  The restaurant itself is nicely decorated in a modern style and it is clean.  There's ample parking out the front.
The selection at first seems limited, but when you look closely there's actually quite a large number of choices.  I'm not an Indian food expert but I do know butter chicken and theirs is lovely, nice chunks of meat, a bit more spicy than what I normally have, but not enough to deter. Naan was brought to the table, warm and light, it was excellent.  We also tried the veg pakoras - tasty and not greasy, and all of the desserts, and had mango lassis.
I can't complain about anything, we will be back."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've eaten in Canada so far! Little bit spicy for my palate but I can bear that for the deliciousness of it. The service is great and the hygiene is spick and span!"}
{"text":"Small and quaint place in strip mall.  Food was excellent (I usually don't like buffet) as it was very fresh and flavourful.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Good job Masala Bites. The reason I say this was we tried out this restaurant about 2 years ago when it just started and not very happy about the taste of food and happened to give it one more try last week. The food is very different now... good choice of buffet both for veg and non-vegetarians. The taste is far more better and I would say perfect now and I remember the staff who are just as courteous as they were years ago... always smiling and welcoming."}
{"text":"Came to Mississauga for a trade show and found this place.  All I can say is the food was great!  Best Naan ever.  We had the Paneer Pakora and Chicken Pakora for the appetizers, awesome.  The Chicken Tikka Masala and the Chilli Chicken were very good!  The service was very good and she was friendly! This place is a small restaurant in a strip mall but I suggest you find it.  I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"The food was great and the staff, I agree with the others they were very pleasant and friendly. The restaurant was very comfortable even though it was small. I would recommend Masala Bites to everyone."}
{"text":"Cons: restaurant is a little on the small side. Pros: what's important is that the food is fresh and amazing. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place was so good! Its an Ayce type setup and I believe they do a la carte and take out. We did the Ayce and it was excellent! -Bring your appetite!  They have a chaat station which was excellent and dessert as well. They have good veggie options for the vegetarians and a couple of fish dishes. Goat curry and an eggplant dish was my fav. I finished It off with a Masala chai which so reminded me of how my mom makes it, perfect ending! Will definitely come here again. The service was also amazing!"}
{"text":"Was not happy with the service. Food is average compared to the rest of the indian restaurants in the area. Not worth the value especially with the service from the waiter/cashier/busperson the one man front of restaurant operation. Pure attitude from him. Highly recommending the ocompetiors."}
{"text":"Awesome food, came out fast, good service.

Chicken tikka, butter chicken, garlic naan and butter naan.

Garlic naan and butter chicken were my favorites but everything was good. Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"The food is good average nothing out of the ordinary. Some of my friends got an upset stomach from eating there."}
{"text":"This was our first visit. Great food, unreal flavour and unbeatable value. $13 for lunch buffet. Will be back for sure!! A++++"}
{"text":"Thou shan't not be displeased, when one asks for food nothing more then perfection is brought to them & when the food it brought...it is brought by men, men who have fought in battles and wars, just to bring the crispy, delicate, golden naan to your footsteps. 

Great service, great food, great place."}
{"text":"The decision to come here to get food was one of total coincidence. We tried two hakka places first - one of them had an hour long wait, the other's phone wasn't working. And to top it off, I was scared to come here because the previous restaurant that existed here before these guys, was downright horrible.
Glad to say that we came away with quite some satisfaction. 
We got palak paneer, paneer lababdar (a glorified paneer tikka masala), mixed vegetable and chana masala. All the curries were good - serving size is nice, enough for 2 people, spiced well, nice and fresh. Not an excess of cream in the palak paneer and lababdar, but I would have hoped for more palak in the palak paneer. 
Would not mind coming here again."}
{"text":"The best Indian food!! Nothing more nothing less!
All dishes have authentic desi flavors. Me and my wife love gorging on the naans, dal makhani, paneer masala, creamy delicios Raita and yes not to forget the hospitable atmosphere. 
The lady we met there a couple of time made sure to ask us if we absolutely loved the food!
Couldn't have asked for more from a restaurant which serves awesomely delicious food as well. 
We just moved to Canada and I believe Masala Bites will be our go to restaurant.
Five star recommendation for anyone who wants to  relish fine Indian taste.

Update - Nov 2016, Have been a regular at this spot, there has been a substantial difference in the quality of the vegetarian offerings - specially on the buffet. Would still go here in the hopes, I get that missing taste back on the pallet."}
{"text":"We travel to this area several times a year and always stop in for a tasty meal. The owners are friendly and provide excellent service. The buffet offers a great selection of vegetarian and meat options. Clean, fair price and consistent quality of food & service."}
{"text":"So here's the thing about this place. The staff makes you feel as if your at home. They provide amazing service and the owner defiantly makes you feel welcomed. 

On a Friday night when its super busy, I noticed the owner going around table to table and asking the customers about how their day was going and just having a general conversation.

Break down of the place:

Food? amazing
Restaurant ? Nice and Clean - good music
Pricing? Reasonable - however, the food is totally worth the buck! 

Keep it up Masala Bites!

Thank you!"}
{"text":"Probably the best thing you can say about this place is it's better than the Indian Pakistani place that was here before them since they use less oil.  
I guess it's easy to take over another restaurant but it's hard to maintain consistency. I try  take out once with a couple different dishes and I really wonder if most of these Yelp reviews on here eat much Indian food .... I can name at least five Indian places nearby that are much better. 
The best thing I like about them is at least they have two sizes if you're not really hungry otherwise it's more like banquet hall quality style food."}
{"text":"I used to be a fan, mainly for take aways, but lately their food seems to have been cooked several days ago and their service, sometimes leaves a bad taste. The owner is the chef and that's a great thing but they seem to getting a bit careless with the preparations and the lady at the till is always grumped out...I haven't dined in, maybe that's better as they also have a buffet...the sad part is that the buffet closes at 8:00 PM or near that time, a bit early for my family."}
{"text":"I am definitely liking this place and will be back soon! It is a small and cozy establishment and decorated nicely. The service is impeccable and the staff are all smiles and super friendly. 
We came with a few friends on a Saturday evening. It was a last minute decision so we called in maybe 45 minutes beforehand to see if they could accommodate us. We originally wanted 7pm but 6pm was the only time they could fit us in. We only had an hour to eat but that was fine. We were seated and served water quickly. The place was packed and it looked like everyone was enjoying themselves. I was super excited as I have not had Indian food for quite a while. The buffet is probably not as big as other establishments but it is definitely more than enough and they have some really delicious items. The buffet stations are located at the back area near the cashier. One side is the cooked food and the other is the salad and dessert area.

I absolutely loved their fish curry, mushroom curry and lamb dish. The butter chicken and chicken tandoori is also very yummy. Now let's talk about naan, the owner (I believe) brings it out right to you and they are huge pieces. We were a group of 4 and we each got 4 long pieces of naan....seriously so good and satisfying and it is all you can eat. We noticed the other table had garlic naan so we asked for that and each garlic naan is $1 extra. Well why not? So we gave it a try. It was definitely a meal full of carbs but it was so delicious! 

My friend ordered the mango lassi and I took a sip. It was refreshing and very good. It  complimented the meal well. If you can handle dairy, give it a try!
This may be a small restaurant in a big plaza but it will not disappoint. Come hungry!"}
{"text":"Very small place. Nice decor. Very cosy. The buffet was absolutely delicious. Not too spicy. Perfect amount of spices. Very polite and attentive service. As soon as we got up to bring more food,  all the empty plates were clean up instantly. Everything was excellent."}
{"text":"You will not be disappointed!!! We have heard so many positive feedbacks about this place today we finally had a chance to find out ourselves. 

You can tell it is family owned and they certainly care about the business. The services were great, the owner and the staffs were friendly. Clean environment. 

We went for dinner buffet on a week day its $16/ person. Its not too bad. Although the selections were not many but there were enough signature indian cuisines to choose from. 

The food tasted delicious, the naan came out fresh and warm- amazing ..... the desserts were decent. 

Our overall experience was fantastic. We will be back again! Keep up the great work Masala Bites!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try this place for a long time and finally got the chance try it! Good thing we did! Nothing bad to say about the place; service is excellent and super friendly, food is fresh good and authentic, very clean and the kids couldn't stop eating the naan's bread since it was all you can eat during lunch time. Will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! The food is super delicious! And I love their chaat options, which are made just right!"}
{"text":"One of the better tasting Indian buffets I've been.

Service www excellent owner always ensure the food is good for their customers. Always full food when empty. Butter chicken and the goat curry was the star . Chicken was actually grill first before the butter chicken sauce was mixed in.

Minus one star for a dirty cup we got but, overall I would recommend this place. Look out for the $20 for $25 Yelp coupon"}
{"text":"The quality of food is still as good as we experienced in our first visit more than a year ago. 

A wonderful cozy place, nice ambiance, tastefully decorated, great service. The staffs offer excellent service with smile. We had Mutton Rogan Josh, a Kashmiri curry with aromatic spices and well cooked tender pieces of mutton. Aloo nan and garlic nan. Masala Cola, which just had the perfect blend of Masala (spices and rock salts)!! 

Definitely this place will be in my shortlist for many more visits."}
{"text":"This review is based on their food and service.
If you are real foodie then you will love this place;everything tasted amazing, a lot of flavor with nice spiciness, price was very fair $18 for buffet on Sunday night.
If quality food is what you are looking for, this is you place, if a more fun or big venue is what you need, then go somewhere else and get ripoff for $30."}
{"text":"Went for lunch buffet today recommended by a friend.  Small place but all the dishes were full of authentic flavor. Even my husband who just started exploring South Asian food could tell the quality of food is amazing and very fresh. Naan was yummy and fluffy. Loved Rasmalai and Kheer as dessert! Service was excellent. A staff offered us if we need some help assuming that we might be new to their dishes. Definitely one of our best Indian restaurant list in Mississauga. Can not wait to bring my family and friends there to impress them."}
{"text":"I have only been to this restaurant once, but it stands out as one of the best Indian buffets.  They don't have as much selection as other Indian buffets, however they had enough variety and the quality everything they offered was significantly higher than the Indian buffet places that boast over one hundred items."}
{"text":"We had the buffet for dinner on a Monday night.   The place was full and thats always a good indication.  The buffet had a good selection and nice assortment of dishes.  We enjoyed most dishes and would say they were better then average Indian cuisine.  

Excellent price to value ration and will definitely return again.  Restaurant is clean and does not have that heavy Indian restaurant smell that sinks into your clothes.  

We did not try ala carte menu but saw a couple dishes pass by that intrigued us to try on our next visit."}
{"text":"Giving this place 4/5 stars. 

I would love to give it more but I felt that I was missing something when I left.

Initially I did not know that this was a buffet place and was pleasantly surprised to find out. I had come in to order take out and was excited to see the wide range of menu options and had a few picked out when I noticed the buffet sign. I should have been more observant. I decided to skip take out and come back later for some dinner buffet.

First, price is amazing for both lunch and dinner buffet. You just can't go wrong here. 

Ambience, very quaint and had a very homey feel to it which I gravitate more toward. So I felt very comfortable. I do have to say the space is a bit tight but that didn't really bother us.

Customer service - the nicest of people who made sure we were comfortable and kept checking up on us every now and again. There were two wait staff, I think they should get maybe one more person just for their sanity, dinner gets kind of crazy. They handled it just fine, but I can only imagine their stress level. This is not a critique of how they run the place, just a suggestion to help them out should they ever read this review.

Food - great selection of appetizers, mains and desserts. Desserts could have had a few more options but they stuck with some great classics and you just can't go wrong there. For apps I tried the Dhai Vada, and puri mixes, they have a spice rack as well to add spice as you please, very cute touch. Mains, I wish I tasted a little of everything but as soon as I saw the butter chicken, I lost track lol. I took the chicken biryani, butter chicken, chicken curry, and goat curry. Sorry no time for veggies (but there will most definitely be a next time). For dessert I had Ras Gulla, Gulab Jamun, and some Gajar Halwa. I can't tell you enough how much I enjoyed my meal. 
Highlights: Goat curry, naan (served at the table), chicken biryani, ras gulla, and gulab jamun. 

Overall experience - we had a great time, we enjoyed the food, and praised the service. 

Pretty much my only criticism is that I wish the food had a bit more spice to it. There was plenty of flavour but it felt a little lacking as they may be trying to appeal to a more western audience. Nothing wrong with that, but I just prefer my meal to have a bit more kick :).

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been visiting at Masala Bites for last one year and it has always been awesome. We have catered for friends and families with them and their food has always been appreciated. My favorites there are the chicken seekh kebab and the Mutton Biryani. 

Their desserts are pretty good, especially the Gulab Jamun which they claim they make onsite. It does taste really good. It's a small place and is getting very popular. I did notice they upped their buffet prices but then thats because they are confident of their food quality.

Sujay is the co-owner who has been a chef at multiple restaurants in the past and he himself does a lot of cooking. That's a good sign when the chef is invested in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and super fair priced indian food. And the service was great and friendly. I only wish the place was bigger with more seats."}
{"text":"5*s for what it is:  A $12 Indian lunch buffet with good food & fresh naan at the table!

I was slightly sad when Bukhara Grill closed, as it was my go-to buffet place, but Masala Bites has officially taken its place!

I've had Masala Bites bookmarked for a while, but decided against it because the prices seemed a bit high for a la carte.  HOWEVER, it seems as though they've added this buffet option and it is much needed as there isn't really a sitdown lunch buffet in the area...unless you want to go to larger buffet, up the street, for more $$$ and not-so-great reviews.

Buffet isn't that big, there are approx. 8 savoury dishes + chaat bar + a coupla salads + a few desserts, but it was sufficient for me and the food was good.  There was a good mix of meat + veg dishes, so go ahead, invite your vegetarian friend!

Lunch service was fairly quiet and there were a coupla people who came in for takeout.  Definitely check this place out if you're looking for an Indian place in the area!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this place.  Tiny place, didn't expect that I would be eating Indian buffet, but kind of happy that I did.  Masala Bites is on the plaza at the corner of Mavis and Eglinton (the named \"Mavis Mall\", which resembles nothing of a mall tbh)

You go in, tiny place, seats at most...25 people?  But let me just say the inside is far more inviting than what I see on the outside.  The atmosphere/ambience feels nice and the place looks very clean too (huge plus)  So my friend and I had the Indian dinner buffet, which is rather impressive that they have a decent value buffet line for the limited seating that they have at their place.  There's the hot food on the left side of the restaurant and the salad/sweets on the right.  Hot food wise, you're looking at around...12 items for selection of food, which caters both to meat and vegetarian guests.  Star food items to me were the fish curry, palak paneer, chana masala and their butter chicken.  Notable mentions are their Goat Curry and Chicken Tikka.  Spice level was just right and everything was super tasty.  

Also note that naan bread is made fresh to order, so the waiter will come around asking if you would like naan bread.  Service here was also very good, constantly taking plates away and topping off water when necessary.

Overall, $18 for the buffet, which I find a great price.  Sometimes when an Indian buffet is too big and has way too much selection, there's just no way to get around trying everything and then you end up paying more than what you really need.  I'm not sure what else these guys could improve on, but in the end, they deliver delicious Indian food that I think many ppl could enjoy."}
{"text":"Went for the weekend dinner buffet, the food was surprisingly good with a decent selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. I asked for the Roti and Naan to be made thinner and crispier and they happily obliged."}
{"text":"Dropped in last night, close to closing and the owner kindly allowed me to order takeout despite the fact they were closing.  My fiancé, who is a picky eater, enjoyed the Biriyani, which they made with breast meat/white meat upon request.  

I recommend the chicken biryani and the naan is made fresh.  Reasonable prices for quality food and good portions."}
{"text":"I came here last Friday for lunch. The visit was part of my team's weekly lunch outing. 

I drove my co-op students to this restaurant, which is located in a crazy-busy plaza in Mississauga. It houses one of the largest No Frills stores that I have ever seen!

The restaurant is small. Don't let that fool you. The lunch buffet has plenty of selection for vegetarians and meat eaters. There were chick pea and lentil curries, and butter chicken and goat curry. The spice level varies, depending on what you get. 

The food is excellent. Everything I sampled was tasty, authentic, and delicious. 

The lunch buffet is $12 a person on Fridays. You can also order from the menu if you don't feel like gorging. 

I didn't do the desserts. East Indian desserts tend to be abundantly sweet. I passed. 

The naan is amazing here. It's soft, warm, and yummy. The water comes in pretty tinted bottles. You drink from what seems to be copper-like mugs, which was nice. 

We got here just after 1 pm. It wasn't all that busy. Staff are nice. Service was wonderful and prompt. 

I'd recommend coming here.

{"text":"I will never come to this place again!

I was very excited to celebrate Mother's Day with my family and try something new. I requested a reservation on yelp before the restaurant opened for the day and thought that was good enough. We arrived at the restaurant at the requested time only to be greeted by the owner who informed us they were full. I asked about the reservation and he said he'd received it but they're full. I questioned him why couldn't he bother to call me or text me that. I wouldn't have driven all the way there for nothing then he back tracked and said he hadn't received my message because if he had he'd reply although minutes before he read my name off his phone and had confirmed the contrary. 
His service was extremely rude and he never once apologized for not doing the right thing. 
I'm a strong believer in customer service and with so many great restaurants in the are why waste time with shitty service. 
Stay away from rude unresponsible management, put your money where it counts."}
{"text":"Monday evening. All empty save for a couple dining in one corner. We are asked if we have reservations. Hmmm. No. You can take table for 2. Wife politely requests for bigger table. Owner is called upon. Looks uncomfortable. Signs and says ok go ahead. Just when we are sitting down: 'We don't like to ask people to move. We get very busy all of a sudden.' All this while looking swollen as if we asked for the world.

The girl on the floor was a pleasant person though. Our previous experience (again in an empty restaurant) was good too. 

But you can't be unaccommodating to present customers for what or who may follow next!

I consider myself easy going enough to pay for unevenly uncooked dishes (if owner doesn't offer to take it off the bill) or even if I have to wait for long time before being served, but I never felt insulted, ever. Until now!"}
{"text":"We tried Masala Bites a few nights ago, to satisfy our craving for Indian food. The restaurant itself is very small, with no more than 8 tables available to sit at. It also allows for reservations, so if you don't call in advance you will be out of luck. The night we went, all but 1 of the tables was reserved. 

The food is pretty good. I will say it is much lighter than most other Indian places I have gone. They seem to use less oil/ghee which is pretty great! So even if you over eat, you don't have that moment later where you are lying in bed regretting life and hoping for death. Dramatic? No. We've all been there. The naan was fresh and free flowing. We were barely down to our last 2 slices before another one was brought to the table. 

As other Yelpers have said... the buffet area, like the restaurant, is small. It did have fewer choices than other buffets. But, I hardly went home hungry. 

The service was exceptional. Very polite servers. They checked on us multiple times. They were never far away with more water, napkins or naan."}
{"text":"I just left the restaurant and this is some seriously good Indian food. I've eaten at over 100 indian places.  This is a really good one. They have a great buffet with 5-6 Indian dishes.  They have a good salad bar and a few good deserts. I don't usually eat desert or salads at Indian places but they look really good and fresh. The butter chicken and goat curry were amazing today.  They bring out a fresh batch of naan bread. Not a little bowl of old crusty bread, a huge basket overflowing with naan. Amazing. I also got a delicious mango drink as well.  Very well done!  I feel bad because the payment machine didn't allow me to leave a good tip. I'll be back and will leave a better tip!  Sorry.  Can't wait to go back though."}
{"text":"4 stars mainly for the service! The food was good but nothing to call home about.. I found the vegetarian dish's better then the meat ones and I went for the meat! It's like having Indian food without the Kick! It is safe for children to eat here as I didn't find it spicy at all and I am somewhat sensitive to spicy food (I don't like it over the top spicy) but I don't mind a little kick.. I wish it was a bit more spicy.. the flavor is there but they don't use all the spices to get that real Indian taste.. I find it more Canadianized Indian food but some of the stuff are authentic.. the salad bar is good, I enjoyed it and I really liked the desserts. They don't have much options, I was hoping to see Tandoori chicken in the buffet when I went last night and nada.. the Channa Masala was really good and I rarely get it at my other favorite go to Indian restaurants.. the one here stands out, so vegetarian lovers, you will be very happy.. Meat eaters if your looking for that Punch.. I didn't find it here but it is worth it to experience it for yourself I'd say. Would I come here again? Maybe.. but only for the buffet.. dinner buffet is $14.99 not bad.. that's like paying for lunch buffet and that's a good deal.. I can see why though, because the options are limited. When I was here last night, they gave everybody having buffet dinner free Fish Masala (deep fried fish) it was decent but tiny, and I prefer chilli fish. The mango lassi was very good and thick and sweet. I had the best Galab Jumon (the sweet doughnut balls dessert) I would come here for this alone (It's my favorite dessert) they are good at making desserts and vegetarian food.. for meat, I'd have to go to another Indian restaurant to get my fix to be honest.. the customer service is very kind and quick and non pretentious which I like.. my waitress was very attentive and I didn't have to ask for refills. Again, I'd come here for buffet but for a la carte I don't find it worth it for the meat but for the vegetarian options it is worth the money, I'm assuming they are more so vegetarian? The vegetarian options tasted like meat.. it was so good! They don't have Briyana rice.. which sucks because I Love Briyani.. they only have regular basmati rice with those tiny seed stuff in it.. I ate a lot of rice though, and it was nice to eat it with gravy. Very fresh. I recommend to try them out if you are in the area. Get buffet to try a variety and figure out what's your favorite item there. Channa Massala! Forgot to mention the free Fluffy Melt in your mouth Naan Bread, they make it good here!!!"}
{"text":"I needed finger food for a party and randomly notice Masala Bite as I was coming out of the NoFrills in the same plaza. It looks like a buffet restaurant, and seemed quite busy on a Saturday night. I went in and asked if they had any samosas for takeout. One very nice man said they had some regular size one left, priced $1 each, but since I needed 40 of them he suggested for me to take the small ones 3 for $1. It was perfect for finger food, great price, and delicouse! The samosas were vegetarian, nice and crispy and still hot. They came with a total of 6 dipping sauces(3 mint, 3 sweet chutney). There was a lot of food at the party, but these samosas were gone fast. Thank you again Masala Bite!"}
{"text":"I had lunch buffet with my family at this place. Food is really good and the place is very clean. We loved their goat Curry and chicken biriyani the most. Desserts are also good ."}
{"text":"After crossing by this place several times and looking at numerous yelp reviews I finally decided to give this place a try and I must say that I loved it! 
We ordered the fish pakoras first which were amazing. They were appropriately battered and marinated. I could tell that they were freshly fried. We also got the mutton biryani which my friend loved. I just did not like the rose water taste in it. We also asked for raita which costed us $3 extra! Normally if you buy biryani from another place it would come with raita on the side. 
I got the chicken Labadar with a naan. Now the curry itself was $16 so you would think that it would come with naan. But I had to order it separately which was another $2. The portion was quiet big and it was packed with flavour. 
After our meal my friend ordered green tea which was cold and costed $3. I gave this place 4 stars because they overcharge you for things like naan and raita. Living in Mississauga you can find a lot of desi joints that cost less. I would still return to try out the buffet on the weekend."}
{"text":"$13.99 for lunch buffet Sunday . Doesn't have much choices for food. The butter chicken is not creamy and there is not much desserts to choose from. 
Their Naan it was okay but no taste butter. Plus there is no chicken tandoori and briyani at the buffet.
The service is good and polite."}
{"text":"Ok so after reading these reviews, I gave it a try today.
As much as it seems like a small & unimpressive place from the outside, it is actually quite a pleasant surprise when you enter.
It is a Cozy Little Place .
I was welcomed warmly 
The food at the buffet was fresh as anything 
A vast variety.
The food was pretty good. I was delighted to be there 
Would highly recommend it.
The butter chicken was very good.
The best part was the fresh naan coming to your table straight from the Tandoor.
Definitely a must try"}
