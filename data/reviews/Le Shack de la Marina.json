{"text":"good: the food was delicious, i ate the lobster poutine the location, well its literally on the shore of Champlain Lake... amazing! theres a live artist performing a few days a week, ours was amazing, good jams :)

bad: the organization, oh my god. the servers were lost. we waited for our food for ages, we got the wrong plates 3 times. two tables that arrived after us got served before us. the servers didnt know which tables were theirs. we waited for 45 minutes before we could even choose our food, we had to flag down a server. which was hard, cause they all ignored us. we only had one menu for two. the plates were huge, but that may be just me, i have a small appetite :) 

wouldnt go back :/"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! You get an incredible view, incredible food, and a great selection of wine for a reasonable price!  We stayed at the inn across the street on a whim after our travel plans got pushed back a day due to car troubles and felt the whole time that the car breaking down was a blessing in disguise. The service at the restaurant was great (especially if you TRY to speak French- at least \"bonjour.\" Luckily I studied in college!) and the food was awesome. We both got the interesting versions of fish and chips (Jamaican jerk and Citron) and poutine (because duh) - all of it was great!  We also had breakfast included with our stay at L'auberge de Venice sur le lac. Eggs, potatoes, delicious sausage - I only regret that I wasn't hungry enough for a crepe - they looked incredible. We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I took a quick getaway to the hotel across the street and this place was the only visible place to eat. It was winter (off-season) and it was very clean and empty.

The restaurant looks over the lake and has gorgeous views!

I ordered the half fish and chips - London style. The half portion was huge! The fish was decent, but nothing special. Fries were nice and salty - kind of reminded me of a crispier version of five guys fries. The only issue was the Cole slaw - it was a vinegar style sauce, but for some reason it tasted off. Did not finish it. 

Hubby ordered the burger which was absolutely delicious. Nice fresh bun and plenty of veggies and a nice sized patty (greasy goodness!). It also came with Cole slaw that did not get eaten. 

A good place to stop by if you're in the area and reasonably priced (especially for us Americans with the exchange rate!)"}
