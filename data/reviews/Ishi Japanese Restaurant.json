{"text":"Worst place to eat ever! The service gets one star but the food isn't worth it. Only thing good was the salad! Lol not hard to make a salad though."}
{"text":"The food was DISGUSTING I was EXTREMELY disappointed the food was overcooked and tasteless I will never eat Ishi again..."}
{"text":"Stopped here last night just before closing. I had an early dinner and I just needed something light and tasty since it was late. Why not a sushi roll? Why not this place since it was on the way home?  I should have listened to my gut upon arrival. I walked in the door to a very unpleasant fishy stench. 1st warning but I justified it with, well they do serve seafood. The smell was so bad I started looking around for the sanitation grade. 2nd warning I could not find it anywhere. I proceeded to order thinking who can really mess up a California roll with crab. The roll was just mehhhh!  The reason for 2 stars instead of 1 is there were a couple couples dining in while I was there. Also there were several to go orders waiting for pick up. They must be doing something right or at least there a a handful of people that enjoy it. Also I didn't get sick from the sushi :-). I can't say that I will be returning no matter how convenient they are."}
{"text":"I love Ishi! The hibachi dinners are delicious and the service is fast and friendly. I gave 4 stars instead of five because the sushi is not the best I've had, but still pretty good. You can also call In a take-out order which is nice."}
{"text":"This was our second stop yesterday. The staff was friendly. The sushi shef was interested in our likes and dislikes. We order our rolls without sesame on them (we like them on the side) but they came with them, no biggie. The rolls were not the best we've had but they were good. The chef gave us a complimentary orange and a box of chopsticks. We will try this again sometime to compare and update our review."}
{"text":"Ishis has always been great to me. I am a long time customer since my college days back in 2002 when Ishis was at its precious small location.  Great service, employees are very polite and will remember you once you've been there a few times. All items on the menu I recommend to get, the cherry blossom roll is quite delicious itself.   Sometimes I may ask for extra sauce with my hibachi steak and they have no problems adding the item to the bag with a smile at no charge.   If you happen to be around the university area, definitely take the time to visit this wonderful restaurant where the phone number is worth keeping as a contact in my iPhone for many years."}
{"text":"I've had ishi for who knows how long, and I'd eat it everyday if I could. I like the staff and environment!"}
{"text":"This used to be a favorite restaurant of mine when I attended college.  The quality and quantity of food was unparalleled and helped on a budget.  The shrimp sauce was also amazing and sushi pretty good.  That was 15 years ago...  Now the food still tastes pretty good but overall the quality/price factor is not there.  The prices have went up considerably ( as you would expect), but the quantity of  meat and veges has been drastically reduced.  The shrimp sauce still has the great flavor but is terribly watered down.  I would still eat there, but have since found better food for better prices elsewhere....  solid 3"}
{"text":"My mom said if you have nothing good to say don't say anything. I hope the money I spent there is given to food poisoning research something good should come from going in that place. For the people that gave this place 5 stars shame on you"}
{"text":"This is by far the best quick Japanese hibachi food in town.. The carrots, fried rice, and sushi are amazing! Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here our first night in Charlotte, exhausted from moving into our college apartment. Immediately, we were in love.  However, the last few times I've been to Ishi, it has been very hit or miss. Also, our orders get screwed up pretty regularly. Just small things like zucchini and onion on the side rather than carrots, or terriyaki vegetables rather than Ishi vegetables. But the employees are all very nice and bring your food out quickly. The prices are reasonable, as well. The atmosphere is kinda strange, but I like it. I'm not even sure how to elaborate on that... The only issue is sometimes they play instrumentals of 80's hits very loudly and it can get a bit annoying.  My personal favorite is the Ishi vegetables, which is basically Hibachi vegetables in a creamy garlic sauce (although some days this entree seems better than others). Meanwhile, my boyfriend swears by the hibachi steak. All of the sushi I've had is pretty yummy, too.  At most Asian restaurants the crab rangoons, miso soup and clear soup are my favorites. But all of these items are just mediocre at Ishi. Surprisingly, the house salad is, as well. It's just lettuce and dressing. There's no tomato, cucumber, or anything that most other restaurants would include on their standard salad.  The two things I would avoid would be anything with scallops, and the hibachi udon entrees. The scallops do not taste fresh at all. I actually ended up picking them out of my meal, before. I'm not sure how to explain the udon, but it just wasn't good. Maybe the udon soup would be better."}
{"text":"I ate here with a friend while visiting Charlotte.  The food was tasty and the service was acceptable.  I would eat here again but wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently moved to the area and wanted to grab sushi. On our weekly trips to Target or Walmart we have passed this place and finally decided to try it.   I've been to my fair share of sushi bars, and this is one of the better ones! The menu is extensive, with over 2 pages of just sushi rolls and pieces. The prices are great, which always makes me skeptical. However, the food arrived quickly (despite them apologizing for a wait) and was well presented. My only comment would be that they slice the rolls thinner - next time I'll request they slice 8 out of the same roll.  Service was good, very attentive staff.   Absolutely recommend this to any sushi lover!"}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi. The parking is pretty good. The sushi is cheap too. The decor is kind of strange I don't know why. The service is outstanding. A problem for me is the tables and booths are somewhat torn and old. A very large variety of rolls here. You get 8 rolls every order of sushi with some exceptions. Overall, I would go here when I'm in the mood for sushi in NC."}
{"text":"By far the worst sushi ever! No matter where you go sushi taste similar, but this place really out did itself to be #1 on my never going back to place. I haven't eaten anything all day. For any type of food to not satisfy you when you are starving must say something. They use take out menus for their dine-in. Service was horrible. I came in to eat by myself and had to sit there with no one to drop off my check after 10 minutes finishing my meal. The only positive thing I can say is the shrimp vegetable dumplings."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Japanese restaurant in the University Area. The food is delicious and fairly priced, The sushi is great even though i don't eat sushi and has a sushi bar. Also to to left of the sushi bar is a Bar with very cheap drinks! The waiters and waitresses are not too invasive and will not distract your conversation while they are dropping off food or refilling drinks. Also have ordered takeout from Ishi many times, Mmmmm thinking about it makes me want to eat there tonight! The environment of Ishi is not so super nice and almost looks outdated and unchanged over the many years of great use! I don't mind it at all, Its always great to step out of the normal upscale places i frequent."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.  I have eaten at this Ishi 3 or 4 times now.  As for the food I would give it 4 stars, but the ambience only gets 3 stars at this location.  The food is good but served on very plain plates and the resturant itself could use a makeover.  A solid place to get a bite with friends but not nice enough to take a date to."}
{"text":"True, it's not the best place for sushi in Charlotte, but I believe the other reviewers are sort of missing out on an important aspect....  Ishi is 'the' place for sushi for UNC Charlotte students...kind of a local asian cuisine hang out...lots of pride and nostalgia that goes into going to Ishi. For the outsider, or someone that just looking for something as classy as Nakato, Ishi isn't your place.   If you're a student, on a budget, and craving sushi and/or maybe some hibachi and a cold beer with other fellow 49er's...while watching the game on the tv's there, you can't beat Ishi. Hands down."}
{"text":"Best Best sushi. Not fancy but who cares. Love it! Anniversary every year- try Flaming Lobster Roll for fancy date. Yummmmmm"}
{"text":"Really dirty place! I got a fly in my water and the manager did not want to help me. I'm not gonna come again worst service ever!"}
{"text":"Just stopped by Ishi this past weekend.  And, it has changed a lot.  The quantity of food is less.  The food did not taste as good as it used to.  and...to top it off....for some reason, their \"special beverage\" license was allowed to expire...or it was not reissued.  I was disappointed.  It had been a long time since I was there....and now...it may be even longer when I return."}
{"text":"No other hibachi compares.  Shortly after moving to Charlotte a year ago, my younger sister (who has lived here 5 years now) took me to Ishi and immediately I was addicted.  The food is VERY quick, whether you choose to dine in the restaurant or take out.  Portions are large.  Their crab rangoon is the best I've ever had - stuffed so full of cream cheesey crabby oniony goodness.  The staff is always pleasant and very welcoming even when you just go in to pick up your take out order.    If this place ever offers delivery service, I will be in SERIOUS trouble.....  :-)"}
{"text":"Ishi's is the best hibachi really fast and cheap! There's always a line and for a reason! I agree that the atmosphere of Ishi's is not meant to wow you, it's a place for the locals and college students, to be able to enjoy great food at great prices, instead of eating McD's or Bojangles! I've been there plenty of times to tell you that the service is good, not anything out of the ordinary, decent. Plus this is the south, there is no such thing as great customer service in this town! There are plenty of places that offer Hibachi and sushi and are definitely better atmosphere, but for the price and convenience, this place tops them all."}
{"text":"Ive never written a yelp review but this one is worth it if it helps other people. I read the reviews for this place and had hope that it was decent sushi for a good price. Boy I was so wrong. I placed a pick up order and got there a little early, hoping to get a drink and finish up some work notes before my week starts. I ordered one of their beers on tap, and then realized where the tap was at. It was right next to the register area, and half of it was covered by cluter and paperwork, I don't even understand why that much stuff was collecting in their \"bar area\". My beer came in a literally frozen glass, there was an ice chunk with little black particles on the rim. I didn't think too much of the situation until after I took a sip... it was sour and rancid. I ordered a Blue Moon, one of the simplest beers to order, and it was absolutely terrible. The orange slice the register girl put on it looked like it was old and withered. When I got my take out order, I told her my beer didn't taste right so she asked if I wanted it off my check or if I wanted a new one. I didn't want to try anything else off their clutered tap area so I asked for it to be taken off my check. So she handed me $3 cash as a result.... Fast forward to me getting back to my hotel room to eat. First thing when I opened my bag, there was left over plastic wrap in there. At first glance I thought it might be maybe a fortune cookie but in was literally just trash thrown into my take out bag by accident probably. On my boxes there were labels, but they were written on the back side of table orders from 6pm! At this point I was extremely sceptical about even eating my food, but the reviews and pictures from this place were so great (and I had just spent $30) that I decided to eat it anyways. I got through about 4 pieces of the 3 rolls I ordered before I stopped myself. The salmon on top of my roll was warm like had been sitting out at room temp for too long and it freaked me out. The shrimp tempera inside my roll wasn't fresh, it was definitely precooked and soft/chewy, not crunchy like it should be. Every bite got worse after that. I was adsolutely disgusted. Even the seaweed wrap tasted terrible. I ended up spitting it out mid-chew and throwing the whole meal away from fear of it getting me sick. I am extremely disappointed by this whole experience. It doesn't make sense because the reviews and the pictures people have posted from this place looked amazing. I highly advise not wasting your time or money here."}
{"text":"Judging by the Yelp reviews, this place gets a bad rep, but it's really not that bad!!  If you want Hibachi that is cooked in front of you, go to Nakato. There, you pay for the show.  Ishi is a no frills, Japanese Hibachi place. I used to frequent here in college when I was low on cash and could get a good quality Japanese dinner for 5 bucks. You can't beat that.  The sushi isn't the best I've ever had, but it's not terrible either. I always get the Hibachi vegetables. I don't even normally like cooked carrots, but I find myself craving the cooked carrots here fairly often. Everything is always prepared and seasoned very well and the staff here is just as kind as can be!  Now, I am PICKY about restaurant cleanliness and lose my appetite at even the smallest infractions...but honestly, that's never happened here. I've never seen anything cringeworthy.  So, stop hating on Ishi for being something it's not: an upscale hibachi grill. This place is an essential for area college students. I wouldn't recommend coming here for a business meeting or a romantic dinner, but it is what it is!"}
{"text":"The hibachi is disappointing even for a cheap hibachi place. Way too salty and not enough veggies, even when I requested extra veggies for no rice. The sushi is better than the other food, but not worth going back for."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why the average rating is only 3 stars. All during my undergrad at UNCC I loved coming here. The inside isn't anything fancy and isn't ever crowded. The wait staff has always been prompt and the food usually comes out fast.   I always order the hibachi chicken and it is delicious! It comes with mushrooms and carrots. I always wanted to try sushi, but afraid to order because there is so many options so where do you start!? I asked the waitress what would be the best for a beginner who doesn't fully want to commit to trying raw fish. She was super nice and recommend the \"Rock n roll\" roll... and it was AMAZING!! So this place has amazing sushi! (Wayyy better than the Harris teeter sushi.. does Harris teeter sushi even count??).   Ultimately if you are in the University area this is a hands down go to place for food!!"}
{"text":"It was okay ... Nice for the family. Food wasn't the best. The rice was a little dry but the environment was nice.   The staff was nice, considering my brother, whose birthday we were celebrating, can be one of those \"challenging customers\"... \"Put this on the side, give me this, give me that, do this, don't do that, can you go see if...\" Bless the wait staff. Overall it was a nice experience."}
{"text":"Compared to some of the Japanese i have had around Charlotte, this place was the best so far,( from what Ive tried) the sushi came out looking beautiful and the service was up to par. I will be going back"}
{"text":"The price for the sushi are reasonable and they have one of the best sushi in the university area. Their shrimp sauce are one of the best too.  Down fall is that I wish they will bring out the food together.  If I go eat somewhere with someone than that obviously means that I want to eat together with that person. I don't want to eat and have my friend watch me eat or wait and have my food get cold."}
{"text":"Co-workers of mine from work raved about Ishi so they wanted to take me there for lunch.  I agreed -- hey, who am I to argue about food?  We walked in and I noticed that there wasn't much ambiance to the restaurant at all.  It's one big room, tables lined up one next to the other.  Nothing special.  It reminded me of a mom-and-pop restaurant \"back in the day.\"    Their menu is pretty extensive with sushi and hibachi items.  Not wanting to hold everyone up and read through each and every sushi item (and not really in the mood for sushi), I ordered a hibachi item like everyone else.  I went with the Hibachi Chicken.  It was good...but really no better than a frozen \"Chinese\" item you pick up from your local grocery store.  The shrimp sauce dip was a nice touch and it gave the rest some flavor, but I tried not to imagine how many calories were in that creamy pink sauce that I dipped my entire lunch into.    All in all, I spent about $10 with the entree, drink, and tip (for which we only saw the server briefly during the order, food delivery, and bill drop-off).  I wouldn't say I'd go out of my way to go back.  There are better lunch choices in the area.  But if my co-workers had a desire to go there again with me, I'd probably go and maybe give their sushi a try (although then I'd end up spending even more for a quick lunch than with the Hibachi entree)."}
{"text":"My second visit here such a disappointment. Waiter ordered the wrong dishes. Hamachi Kama partly uncooked. Age tofu overcooked. Sashimi arrived last in a heap and was sad and tired.  Sushi rolls were ok but turned up before appetizers. Dishes weren't cleared away. Sad sad sad."}
{"text":"I have been coming here regularly for the past 5 years. Everything I've eaten has always been amazing! They're friendly, fast and always willing to make your food the way you want it. Try the Texas Roll, it's delish."}
{"text":"Last night had a holiday roll-- waitress was super helpful and friendly the entire night.  She's usually working the sushi bar, so it was fun to see her out and about.  Roll was fresh and tasty, good spice and she put tobiko on top at my request.   We had the tempura ice cream for dessert at her recommendation-- first time I've enjoyed fried ice cream! Big serving-- would have been better to split than each order our own.  As opposed to the usual rice-krispies-around-ice-cream it was a dough shell.  The outside had been fried a little, but the inside was soft/cake-y from being close to the ice cream.  She said they'd been made earlier that day, so it wasn't warm, but still tasty.   I'm not a big fan of the actual entrees or lunch specials, though my roommate always gets them and enjoys. Definitely a good place to go for sushi."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at a dive sushi bar.  I saw the parking lot was full, which is normally a good sign.  All the cars were for the gym next door.  There were a group of sorority girls for me to look at, but otherwise shotty decor.  Bathroom was nasty.  Miso soup was edible but the rice in my main dish tasted like it was a few days old.  I didn't try the sushi, there are other places similar but better very close by."}
{"text":"We visited Ishi for the first time on Saturday 4/29/17 with a party of 11, including small children.  I called while we were on the way there (terrible, I know) and asked if we could be seated and was assured we would.  We walked right in to a large table.  It was perfect.  We had three separate parties and there was no problem splitting checks, from the beginning.   I ordered the tempura veggies for the table and it was delicious - battered and fried zucchini, carrots, onions and mushrooms.  Very good and came piping hot.   Others at the table ordered hibachi entrées, which they said were very tasty and high quality.  I, myself, had two specialty rolls which were beautifully presented and amazingly huge and fresh.  The quality of the fish inside the rolls was commented on by all who had it.  Everything came out quickly and correctly.    Service was quite friendly - no complaints at all.  As expected, gratuity was added to the bill prior to payment.  No issues.  We'll be back to this place, for sure in the future."}
{"text":"Tried my first sushi here for my birthday...and since I have no reference point...I'll just say it was was yummy! :)   I ordered teriyaki chicken and veggies and my sister ordered a HUGE platter of sushi.  I sampled several, the spider roll was my least favorite..I'm not really sure why, but it just didn't work for me...the alaskan roll was good- I really like the avocado in that one.  The tempura tuna was really good and the sauce had quite a kick, but not overpowering for a first timer!  After looking over the sushi menu, I think I'd try some of the vegetarian options next time I'm at Ishi...  The waitress was patient while I asked questions and our glasses were never empty! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Honestly, the fact that this place has a 4.5 star rating is appalling!  Do not be fooled by the rating given by people that clearly haven't been out to eat in several years lol.   Food is overpriced big time.  For a hibachi meal you are going to pay $3+ more to get 2 kinds of meat than if you just have one and the waitress told me there is the amount of meat, the charge is just for getting different kinds....woah what a freaking rip off!!!!  Rice is crap....idk how else to say it, you can tell by looking at it that it is low quality.   I love ginger dressing...there's is pretty good but they literally put double the amount I would normally put on....and I put more dressing on salads than most people I know!   Sweet tea was EXTREMELY sweet.  Some may like that, again, I like it sweet but this was really over the top.   Recap:  more expensive than almost any japanese express restaurant and the food was mediocre.  Don't go here...why would you?"}
{"text":"Some friends and I decided it was time for a sushi night and we ended up at Ishi.  The restaurant had a wide open dining area and is one of the largest japanese restaurants I've been in.  The atmosphere was very laid back and casual and the dining area decor isn't anything fancy.  We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door and the hostess was very friendly.  Our waitress was also extremely friendly and helped us make some of our sushi selections.  The menu is huge with lots of options for entrees other than sushi.  I ended up with 2 maki rolls that were both delicious.  The rolls were so large it was practically impossible to eat a piece in one bite which made things a little awkward...  Also both of the rolls I had were covered in lots of sauce and seasoning which made it difficult to distinguish the flavors of the different types of fish and other ingredients in the rolls.  The hubby got a shrimp hibachi meal that he seemed to enjoy.  I tried a couple bites of his meal and I wasn't impressed in comparison with my meal.  Everyone else in the group got sushi and they enjoyed theirs as well.  The prices were pretty good for the size of the rolls.  I'm still in search for some mind-blowing sushi in Charlotte but if I want lots of sushi for the money I'll come back here."}
{"text":"Meh.  Ishi is your average express Japanese cuisine.  I ordered the Hibachi Chicken and it was over salted and there wasn't much chicken on the place."}
{"text":"Totally not impressed with this place. Sushi had way too much rice on it and did not taste fresh at all. I ordered Hula and Tropical rolls and I was totally not impressed at all. I just left Susan Kolmen race for the cure and was super starving but yuck!!!   Service was good but food wasn't. The salad even has limp lettuce. Mind you I'm used to having sushi in dc where I live so I guess I couldn't expect much more."}
{"text":"This place is great!  I have been eating at Ishi for over six years and I've never been disappointed.    The food is flavorful, cheap, and delicious!  On top of that it comes to you quickly!  The staff is all about efficiency.  They seat you as quickly as possible and serve you as quickly as possible.  I appreciate that.  There are often days when I have cravings for Ishi, and only Ishi.  The atmosphere is okay.  Nothing fancy or glamorous.  Although, I heard they have moved to a new location so that may have changed.  This place is simple and to the point.  It's cheap.  It's quick.  It's delicious.  As long as they keep those characteristics I'll be a loyal, satisfied customer."}
{"text":"Interrupted me mutiple times, very rude. They took a while to take our order and the place was not busy. When the food finally came, it was cold and the rice was hard. Definitely not coming back after such a horrible experience."}
{"text":"Delicious, quick, and inexpensive hibachi and teriyaki meals are the star here. Food for dine in and takeout are both quick. Their service is friendly."}
{"text":"Ishi has a very wide menu with lots of good stuff. My favorite dish is the Ishi Steak. Nice steak grilled with mushrooms and rice. Servers are nice, but food sometimes takes a while to come out of the kitchen. Atmosphere is calm."}
{"text":"I love the place! the food is always good. I never have any problem going there. The only thing is that the place is little too big. Too many distance and space but like I say the food is good and the price is right"}
{"text":"Their jumbo shrimp is NOT JUMBO by definition. It's Medium shrimp raw and even smaller if it's cooked... Misleading the customer not good."}
{"text":"I'm usually not picky about the taste of my water at all but the glass they gave me here was really gross.  It literally tasted like hose water.    I ordered a TNT roll as well as the Alaskan roll and also tried some of my family's dishes.  The food here is just mediocre.  It wasn't bad but it definitely was not good.    Service was fast but the employees (and manager) didn't really seem like they were happy to be there and were very unenthusiastic.  Some tables had the low sodium soy sauce and some tables didn't which was weird.  Also, one of the servers AND the sushi cook was wearing a baseball cap with NY on it... very unprofessional.    This is supposed to be a Japanese restaurant but it looks very Hawaiian-themed, which really didn't make any sense.  What was more confusing was the fact that they were playing jazz music very loudly.    Overall, this place just doesn't make any sense.  I give it 2 stars because the portions were good and prices for sushi were decent.  Other than that, this place needs a huge makeover and I wouldn't recommend coming here unless it's your last resort."}
{"text":"I visited Ishi tonight with some fellow yelpers (Megan P., BJ S, and Sam P) tonight and I was pleasantly surprised with the selection even if the inside was a bit grungy :) .  Our waitress was great - she had some awesome recommendations and I was very very pleased with her suggestions. I was barely able to eat the two rolls I ordered there was so much food and the display was very aesthetically pleasing!  I'd honestly rate this as a 3.5 experience, but because the service was great, I bumped it to 4.   If you are in the university area and want a low key sushi place, I'd recommend swinging by."}
{"text":"i've given this place a couple chances before writing my review, but each time was worse than the time before.    i'm not sure how you can mess up miso soup, but it was horrible!!!  the rice was very bland and the chicken was more fat than actual meat.  i will NOT be visiting this place ever again!!!!   only positive is it's cheap, but i guess you get what you pay for!  personally i would rather pay more for something i enjoy and something i find edible!"}
{"text":"I dined in at the restaurant with a friend a couple weeks ago because of the flashy lights on its exterior and convenience, but was a bit disappointed.    We were sat in the a booth, which looked more thrifty than inviting.  It was somewhat busy for a Saturday lunch.  We began  by ordering hamachi kama as an appetizer, and even though I know it takes a while to make, but ended up arriving at our table well after the entrees we ordered. The hamachi kama came out a bit more browner in color than I am use to, but was pleasantly surprised at the flavor and moistness of the fish.  We also ordered a couple pieces of sashimi and one sushi roll.  The presentation looked a mess with everything just plopped on the plate.  The sashimi cut was jagged and the flavor did not taste up to par to what I am use to.  The sushi roll had cooked fish on the inside, but the sushi rice was flavorless and not quite what I was expecting.  We also ordered vegetable ramen noodle stir fry, but when it came it out, it was just overly oiled vegetable lo mien (like from any takeout chinese restaurant).    The servers however were quite attentive and helpful.  The price was low to average, but since I would rather pay to eat quality sushi, I do not think I will dine here again."}
{"text":"It was my first time here with a couple of friends. I just had sushi while my friends had the hibachi. It tasted decent for the price but the plating for sure looked a lot better than other restaurants. The thing about it is that the other entrees like hibachi don't stand out too much. The place itself could get a bit more cleaned up but otherwise, not bad. The service was super nice and checked up on us from time to time to make sure we were fine. I plan to come back some other time to try some other items.  The score is for the quick/friendly service and sushi!"}
{"text":"I love their hibachi shrimp & seaweed salad!  Good & fast.  I can't say anything about the sushi.  The staff is attentive, but the ambiance leaves something to be desired!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, I really haven't had anything else, I've been twice for lunch.  Very wide range of rolls to choose from, and the sashimi love boat is amazing!  Reasonably priced, clean, great service; highly recommended."}
{"text":"Well the food was good & the quantity was well  worth the price for sure. I am one who easily can finish a Japanese meal, but I had to take a to-go box with the steak & chicken combo meal.  The service was less than stellar & I basically ate with my eyes closed because the restaurant itself was dirty & poorly lit. Spiderwebs we're all over the picture frames hanging on the walls.  Would I eat there again? Yes, but only for take-out."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is run down. Booths with holes with a warehouse feel. Upon being seated recieved a crumpled paper menu (appeared to be a takeout menu) with writing all over it in pencil. Was told it was the previous restaurants owners disposable menu used to order from the sushi bar, hence all the checkmarks, but they recycled as their menu.  The spring rolls sat in a puddle of grease on the plate, and they were mushy inside. (appeared frozen and dumped into the oil ) They were so greasy when picking them up my fingers glistened.   The tempura was not tempura batter but rather the batter you would expect on fish n chips.  That also had a shiny sheen of grease. The chicken was dry inside and It was also tastless and bland. Greasey shell on top of tasteless dry chicken.  Felt nauseous from all the grease and couldn't finish. Ewwwwww"}
{"text":"I like coming here since it's close to school. My boyfriend and I came here for late lunch and our waitress was rushing me. I'm a server myself and you DONT rush customers.  The hibachi is mediocre. It's cheap and I can tell it's premade. I don't know, that's just me.    You will see me here but not as often. Maybe once in a blue moon. :/"}
{"text":"Drinks were really good here (Tito's sodas).  Sushi sampler #1 had ample chunks of fish, but I feel like the presentation fell flat.  The rolls weren't tight and symmetrical like I'd expect from a 5 star sushi bar, but for $9.99 for 16 pieces of sushi it's hard to complain.  Fried rice side was ok, but nothing special.  I'm wondering how their specialty rolls would have been, but I'm more into traditional rolls like yellowtail scallion.    One thing I can say is that they have an overwhelmingly large menu, so there's definitely something here for everyone."}
{"text":"Decided to grab a quick dinner here tonight, and left with a bad taste not only in my mouth from the hair found in my sushi after taking a bite but also from the sour attitude of the owner / manager lady at the front register. Since the sushi had to be remade and wasn't done until I finished our entrees, I had to take it to go and pay .50 cents for a shrimp sauce to go as well. Due to no bag given with my box I dropped my shrimp sauce outside and went back inside to request a new one and the management refused to give me another. Instead they insisted I repay and justified it by saying: \" I didn't drop it \" . Highly unprofessional customer service seeking just your money and not to give you a decent sushi experience at the very least."}
{"text":"Great price for a good amount of food, also very college affordable for any other students like myself."}
{"text":"The pricing is fairly good for dinner dishes but the sushi is a bit expensive. The quality of the food was alright and the sushi is quite tasty do I guess you get what you pay for. The shrimp sauce is really good."}
{"text":"I love love love sushi. And even better: cheap sushi. This place is perfect for the college student looking to fulfill that sushi craving on a budget.   I come here often with boyfriend though, if I had the pick of the liter, this would not be it. Sometimes the sushi comes out warm or maybe even smelly. I've never had anything that tastes bad nor have I ever been sick from eating here either, but there are DEFINITELY better sushi places in the Charlotte/University area. Service is strange but efficient and they do take out/delivery too! Right down the road from UNCC"}
{"text":"I think Ishi is an unnoticed gem in the Charlotte sushi scene; I go there a lot and the food is always of consistent quality and they have a BIG variety of rolls. They're also one of the few restaurant in Charlotte that serves simple but quality hibachi entrees at fair prices, and fast!  I have to rave about their sushi because Ishi does not come off as a fancy, high-end sushi bar, but their rolls are fantastic! They must have a good chef because the special rolls are well put together and delicious, plus they are always tightly packed with perfectly cooked rice. Cold ingredients are cold and fried rolls have just the right amount of tempura. ALSO the presentation is great, the plates are always beautifully arranged and decorated! If you get hibachi, the shrimp sauce is not too runny and the meat is cooked to order and cut into small pieces rather than huge chunks. The meat and vegetables always taste fresh.  Their prices are extremely fair--maybe even a little low--for the quality and quantity of food they serve. The building they're in now seems a little too big for them and is poorly decorated; but like I said, this is not a high-end Asian steakhouse so maybe you should expect as much. The facility is usually pretty clean and the booths/tables are in good repair.  My only complaint is that the service is generally AWFUL. Their servers are obviously untrained and can get very obnoxious; when they hand you the menus (which, by the way, are paper ad sometimes re-used a few too many times before they are tossed) they expect you to know what you want right away, then come back too soon and repeatedly to nag you about your order. Usually the food is ready promptly, but once I waited 40 minutes for a simple sushi order while my boyfriend's hibachi meal arrived quickly--he was done eating before my food even got there. A few of the employees are very friendly, but most of them don't seem to care about the customers at all and it shows.  So: great food, lots of variety in the sushi, but get it to go if you don't want to deal with the shitty waiters!"}
{"text":"I've been to Ishi twice now both times at what other reviewers say is their second location. It does have a too large feeling but both times I've been there there have been a good amount of people. But the best thing about Ishi is their sushi. Its fresh. They have a lot of different rolls but they also have many types of fish that I haven't seen listed on the menus of restaurants in South Charlotte. I particularly like Wahoo.  Both times I was there I ordered 15 pieces of salmon nigiri & 2 of wahoo. I seemed to be the only one eating sushi. Most of the other patrons seemed to have very little time for lunch & were ordering lunch specials. THe chef visited my table the last time & presented me with an orange. It was the perfect way to end the meal.  My waiters both times have been polite & efficient."}
{"text":"3.49 stars it is.  They seemed to have a pretty big sushi selection. However, not being much of a sushi lover, they had a good selection of hibachi entrees to choose from. i was content with the cost of my Ishi Shrimp selection ($7.25 plus 50 cents to add zucchini). The portion size was exactly right as I cleaned my plate and left with a full belly. Not to mention, it was solidly delicious.  I did try one of Mrs. P's sushi and i could barely get it all in my mouth, it was ginormous (twss). It wasn't too shabby tasting.   The interior of Ishi was kind of an ishi (as in issue...anyone? ...mrs. p?), although I was amused with the look of the sushi bar area (like a thatch roof Tiki vibe going on). The place actually had the appearance of a former Mexican restaurant and would probably not be the sushi place you go to impress a date.   However, i thought our service was wonderful. Our server was very friendly, helpful with suggestions and they were always on top of our water refills. We even got a fancified orange at the end of the meal and  mints with the check..   We do not venture to this area often enough to likely make a return trip but it was a very satisfying dinner.  Beer drinker note:  Bud light, Miller Lite, Coors  $2.00 Sam Adams bottle, Blue Moon  $2.50 Heineken, Corona $2.75 Sapporo, Kirin $3.00"}
{"text":"I have been going to ishi since it was the little hole in the wall at the end of the hobby lobby strip. I've been in love ever since. the food never fails to impress me. it's always good - dine in or take out (and I do both!) their chef specialty sushi rolls are DELICIOUS! def don't pass that over. their menu is vast so plan on coming back plenty of times to find your favorite.    try to crab Rangoon it's the BEST."}
{"text":"Oh where to start. I was in search of Gyoza. They have Gyoza...that is where it all goes south. This place has 3 stars for a reason. 3 stars is really really high if you look at the ONE STAR I gave it.   It's a flipping train wreck. It is what every failing restaurant show is trying to fix X10. Everything is wrong with this place.  The outside should tell you not to enter. It's a mess and unkempt. Three feet in the door should have told you to just walk away but I wanted Gyoza.   The inside is an even bigger train wreck of a mess. I think it used to be a seafood/beach restaurant. It's just dirty. A quick walk around and you can see fingerprints and dirt everywhere. The inside of the place has not been cleaned in a long time.   The tables are all covered in some type of fake leather material and are ugly as sin.  There are piles of supplies all over the place like they can't figure out where to put anything and have run out of space. There is a back room that is filled with crap all the way to the ceiling.    The sushi bar looks dirty and if you look behind the bar you will see an even bigger mess. Just crap everywhere that does not belong. Everything feels broken and out of place. The bathrooms are not dirty but they are not clean either. You just don't get the feeling you should be in there and washing your hands is never going to make anything better.  The menu is a mile long. Way too long for anything in the back to be fresh.  Needless to say the Gyoza was either steamed or deep fried. Sorry you can't do that. Gyoza is pan fried and then steamed. So this trip was to prove that I would never go here again. When you put \"AUTHENTIC JAPANESE\" on the menu then you had better know what that means. Nothing in there is \"AUTHENTIC\" anything.  The lack of customers to chair ratio should have been another indicator of how bad this was going to be. During a lunch rush in the middle of a business area they should be packed but sadly they are not. Every restaurant in the area is busy like crazy during lunch and there are 10 cars in the lot and about 10% of the chairs with butts in them. That is a bad sign.  I can't stress this place is a mess. If you think it's \"OK\" or \"NOT THAT BAD\" then you clearly don't know what clean is or how a restaurant should look and operate. They should be closed down and a deep cleaning done along with a huge reduction in the menu for starters.  These people should not be running a restaurant at all!  I could go on and on but will just advise to not go here and waste your money. Any place that discounts bugs laying around and replies on Yelp is not to be trusted.   They are making excuses. Take your $10 - $15 and go next door to the McDonald's...even if you threw away the McDonald's after you purchase, it would be a better option than eating here. I am trying to save you!  PS - For anyone who gave it 3 or more stars....shame on you!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went out for what we hoped would be a great date night, we decided on Ishi based on the reviews, everything was horrible! I ordered the squid salad which I swear is the same exact one sold at Harris teeters sushi section, then we got an Alaskan roll and an eel roll, the Alaskan was OK but the eel roll was seriously skimpy on the eel, it also had a funny aftertaste. The ginger had a nasty chemical/soapy taste. For dinner my bf ordered steak & chicken ramen which was super greasy and the steak was well done and not the md. rare he asked for. I ordered the ishi steak also well done not md. like I requested, it was just so bland and greasy. The only good thing on my plate was the carrots. The service left alot to be desired as everyone was gathered around the TV watching American idol our waiter only checked on us once and never refilled my drink. I'm not sure if this place has just gone down hill in recent months or the other reviewers like greasy bland food, its about an hour later and me and my bf both have stomach aches, I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN!!!!"}
{"text":"It was like any other Japanese Hibachi restaurant. The service was friendly. The hibachi entree was okay; I ordered the teriyaki steak. It was a sweet teriyaki, and it's in the print... I just didn't read well. It was too sweet for my liking! The sushi was okay as well. Ordered plenty of it. The rice was softer than most places and it was hard to pick up the sushi pieces because they were falling apart from the rice being so soft... Overall, the experience was okay. The prices are pretty good for what you get though. I'd consider coming back..but it isn't at the top of my list."}
{"text":"The wait staff is nice and clean and prompt when I go there. I like to go for dinner or an early dinner. I love their hibachi selection and Osaka roll. My boyfriend enjoys the Chicken Udon. The portions in the restaurant and take out are perfect, couldn't ask for anymore and they usually last me two meals almost. This place is my definite Japanese go to in the university area."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place yesterday for the first time since we were craving Asian food so we ordered take out. I ordered the chicken teriyaki with friend rice and the California roll sushi which was about $13. The fried rice came with shrimp sauce and that seemed to be too runny. Also the teriyaki chicken seemed to be too under seasoned and fried to death (too dry). The rice was mediocre and sticking together. The sushi arrived hot, the avocado in it tasted old and so did the crab meat. There was no flavor in the sushi whatsoever. I was very disappointed. My boyfriend took his meal in a to go box as well and when he tried to reheat it later it smelled horrible. I suggest that if you want some delicious Japanese food then skip this location. Pay some more money and get better quality food elsewhere. I'm very disappointed at this location and I wish I could give them less than one star. Even an Asian buffet can do better than this."}
{"text":"Food is satisfactory, but I don't like being rushed to finish 10 minutes before close."}
{"text":"Got hibachi chicken and shrimp. good price for the amount you get. Ordered to go and it was done quickly. Only bad point might be the thin consistency of the mustard sauce and shrimp sauce. The food was very good though.  All in all, pretty good deal."}
{"text":"One of the low end Japanese express style of restaurants in the university area. The rice is horrible, the plates are over priced ($2-$3 dollars more than other places),  and the serve is mediocre at best.   Given the option, I'd steer clear of this place and go other \"quality\" restaurants in the area. But i'd say try this place out if you enjoy drowning your plates in shrimp sauce; Its all going to taste the same anyways."}
{"text":"Best sushi in university area. Place is super big and presentation for sushi plates are really cool. Staff is friendly but every time I go here it seems fairly slow but maybe because I go around 3 or 4 pm"}
{"text":"This place could really use a remodel on its decor. It's not anywhere where I want to stay inside and eat. Whenever I do stop at Ishi, it's to pick up my to-go order.   The food is OK. I've definitely had better sushi at other places but its conveniently located near me so whenever the sushi craving hits, I can make a quick stop. I usually get the dragon roll and a egg roll. I'd recommend skipping their fried rice. I find it to be tasteless and that's just a big ol' NO for me.  If you're in the mood for sushi AND in the area, I'd say give Ishi's a try but keep your expectations in check."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place I've been to in charlotte. I have been several times and have not been disappointed. There is never a wait or a long line, and the sushi is very good. I always get the winter land roll and the key west. The sushi is not the only thing here either the dumplings are awesome. They have a website where you can order ahead and get your sushi right when you walk in. The service is speedy yet not rushed. Right after you finish eating and get a box, which you will need, the check is on its way. You aren't rushed out though and the atmosphere is inviting. The restaurant is completely clean and I just love this place. When your in that part of town with not a lot of options for food, I say you have to go check it out. Even if you don't like sushi, the sushi here doesn't taste all fishy and plain. This place is where it's at. Go Go Go. 5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"Great food for a really good price! My boyfriend and I come here all the time. I like to bring my friends along too to get them hooked as well. Wonderful place to grab lunch or dinner (:"}
{"text":"I'm not too sure about all of the negative and mixed bag reviews. We are regulars at Ishi and probably visit three or four times a month. It is not a fancy restaurant. It's summer we go when we need something quick and not terrible for you. We regularly get spicy salmon sushi and hibachi or teriyaki chicken. Portions are always consistent for the price, and the vegetables are clearly fresh. We usually have the same server by chance and she always remembers our order. Give it a try just don't have the same expectations as a pricey restaurant.  If you want a meal for under $10 this is the place."}
{"text":"The sushi is absolutely terrible. I feel a little bad for writing this, since the service is pretty good. The Hispanic sushi chef has no idea how to make sushi. Most rolls have a ton of filler rice, vegetables and cream cheese. Why cream cheese?? Why??? And the shrimp tempura tastes like it's been cooked in beer batter."}
{"text":"Atmosphere:  1.5/5 - There's a scary back room, the colors are strange, VERY scary music, and an odd red neon strip of lights above the cashier's kiosk.   Quality of service:  4.5/5- pretty attentive, no refills on water. Excellent on every other front. Considerate.   Taste:  4.7/5- spicy mayo for the sushi was a strange consistency and flavor. Hibachi chicken and hibachi shrimp were delicious. One diner remarked, \"I could eat this stuff all day. I would eat it out of a trough.\"   Food presentation:  3/5- wasn't bad, wasn't good  Cleanliness:  3/5- our server didn't know if he had already wiped our table or not, lol."}
{"text":"So good for a sushi craving. The place is dated and not the cleanest to sit in, but it's worth it for the sushi."}
{"text":"This place is just disgusting. Usually I can suffer through bad sushi but this was awful!  Old rubbery seaweed wraps, warm slimy sashimi, mushy rice. Just disgusting."}
{"text":"Japanese that isn't cooked in front of you...it's pretty good but that's it. Nothing spectacular. I prefer the cook in front of you places. Take out portions are larger than if you are eating in.  After eating here for the past 9 years I had never tried their sushi. My coworker wanted to go and so I decided to give it a try. Sushi was great! Many rolls to choose from and you can customize. The Green Mountain roll does it for me. Spicy tuna (my fav) and avocado on top. Yes!!  People are always nice and friendly too, esp the sushi maker (??) girl. Sometimes the music they play is oddly depressing though.  Also need to update the inside. Booths are worn out and the server station in middle of rest looks sketchy."}
{"text":"I've been to Ishi's many times. Sometimes I eat in and sometimes I call ahead for carry out. They have a good sized menu. The wait staff is knowledgeable. I admit I am a rookie when it comes to sushi but I can't say enough about the Fried California Roll.   The food quality is good and the prices are reasonable. You can find cheaper japanese food close by but it doesn't match the food at Ishi's."}
{"text":"Omg best sushi ever. The servers are so fun and attentive and the rolls are fresh and massive.  I am eating here all three nights I'm in town!! Aaaand they do brown rice or seaweed for the super healthy person. I love the tuna lover roll and the hoki roll.  The largest roll ever is the super taiyo roll. Also a great choice and super filling.  Based on other reviews seem people don't care for hibachi but I only eat sushi and for that it's great.  It's a super casual place bit old and outdated not a great date spot but again for pure sushi food enjoyment (I sit at the bar) it's 5 stars for me."}
{"text":"OK sushi. Tried it several times. When I'm shopping at Home Depot, Target or Pet Smart. I get a thing for sushi and cold Japanese beer. Conveniently located in the same parking lot of Home Depot. Every time, disappointed."}
{"text":"So a mix up in the university Japanese places led this gaggle of yelpers to ishi!  From judging previous reviews the expectation was set a lil low, but being there we thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  Two of the gang got there a lil early and enjoyed some miso and edemame and plethora of water refills.  Prices were reasonable (about average for sushi) and service was fantastical.  Being vegan, there were more than just the traditional avocado and cucumber rolls on the menu and they're not afraid to make a delectable spicy veggie roll! YUM!   The atmosphere is quite nice as well with a tiki set up for the bar... you know, everything that's expected of a Japanese sushi place. :)  I'd definitely go back!  good times had by all!"}
{"text":"We come here a lot for sushi because the fish is always great quality. The kitchen clearly places a lot of emphasis on presentation. Each roll is always beautifully crafted. The menu has a very ample variety of standard Japanese fare (hibachi meals, noodles etc). It's usually pretty quiet. Although it's very close to UNCC the college crowds come and go in small groups and typically go unnoticed. Service is always friendly, its clearly a family business  and you can tell. The servers aren't always perfect but  consistently good. I'd love to see this place get a remodel. The ambiance could definitely use an upgrade. But I'll probably keep coming even if they never remodel, because the food is very consistently excellent."}
{"text":"good teriaky chicken with rice, sushi is decent."}
{"text":"I try really hard  to love this place because  it's in my old neighborhood and my coworker love it . So I tried again . I order onion soup which was extremely salty and served in a white drinking cup :-( and veggie hibachi can you say gross. The rice taste very old and the veggie looked As if they were frozen and later cook. I guess I will put in the towel and make this my last time ."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for japanese so I decided to come here. The inside is quite spacious. They have a lot of booths and that is a plus in my book. The decor is sort of a tiki feel and I cannot correlate what tikis have to do with sushi LOL.   I dont know what our waitress's name was. She was polite though. I am a noodle lover so of course I ordered the shrimp ramen. I keep finding myself disappointed when I order ramen at these restaurants because it is not true ramen. It was still pretty delicious. I am one of a dying breed of women to eat with a napkin on my lap. I spill food ALL THE TIME. As my fork wrestled with the last floret of broccoli on my plate, the sauce splashed across the front of my dress. LOL. I guess I need a napkin tucked into my collar as well!  Enjoyed myself, nonetheless. Try it!"}
{"text":"The first time I went to Ishi, the food was great.  Every time after, it has been just okay. At least twice, the rice was old.  Not good for what they charge.  Thankfully I found Toyama."}
{"text":"Had a delicious sushi dinner here last night! The presentation was just the beginning of a feast for the senses. :-) started with seaweed salad and then ordered the Christmas Roll and Cherry Blossom Roll. AMAZING!! will be going back soon"}
{"text":"I like to visit Ishi every now and then to remind myself of my college days at UNCC. I almost always go for their great sushi creations which I always recommend to others. So far they're one of my favorite sushi joints in the free world.  I'm not a huge fan of their new location. The spacious emptiness of the old Taiyo restaurant really kills some of the intimacy that they had in their old corner location of the shopping center. They're so popular that I'm often surprised to see them so empty when I stop in. I do just chock it up to the larger floor plan and imagine they get hit hard by UNCC students on Thursday nights.  Sushi is the one way to go when you come here. You won't be disappointed! My biggest recommendation would have to be the Kamikaze roll. As always the staff is friendly. I do wonder if the rumors about management taking the servers' tips were ever true though."}
{"text":"After leaving a previous bad review about their horrible customer service the manager sent me a very ugly private message here on yelp. Telling me I'm \"inexperienced\" when it comes to sushi and I have a bad memory. Very poor in taste. It only reaffirmed my decision to NEVER return to this rude disgusting restaurant."}
{"text":"Man it is not hard to make this kind of food and i expect alot more from a place that is advertised as a japanese restaurant. I have eaten here twice and i will not be back. They just don't cut it on the hibachi side of things all the food is either mushy or has no flavor. My tuna roll was fine and thats the only reason for 2 stars. That being said it was not good enough to go here just for sushi."}
{"text":"Ishi in their new location is the bomb of Japanese hibachi and fresh sushi at a reasonable price and quick service.  I've been going to Ishi for 10 years now and it's been consistently great."}
{"text":"Ishi is a UNCC staple.    I honestly never ate the Sushi their.  When I went their I either got the Hibachi steak/chicken or the Teriyaki Steak/Chicken.  For a 6 dollar meal it was great and has great portions.  I give it 4 stars for being affordable and I love meat and rice."}
{"text":"Almost walked out of the place.  Having spent 7 years working in the restaurant industry, I have learned that there's a good correlation to condition of the bathrooms and the overall hygiene in the kitchen.  While some places can slip on hygiene (provided they deep fry everything and serve it hot), sushi cannot.  Poor hygiene leads to an unhappy digestive system.     Had I not already ordered my food, I would have left after using the restrooms.    I stumbled in here by accident and I would be happy to not try it again.    Overall the quality and flavor of the sushi was about as good as a supermarket.  It was not bad, per se.  But, it certainly was not good.  I would not recommend Ishi for sushi.    The atmosphere gets a 2 out of 5.  Service gets a 2 out of 5.    I recommend a \"pass\" when you are in the mood for sushi."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Japanese restaurant in Charlotte. Their service is always very prompt, whether you are dining in or getting carry out.  Their food is always amazing regardless of what you are getting.  Their sushi is SO good and doesn't take forever like many other sushi restaurants.  Their habachi chicken plate is also amazing.  The food is always cooked properly and the sweet carrots are soo good."}
{"text":"Really loved Ishi when they were at the old location, because it was cozy and always full. Since they moved they have a bigger place, had to cut costs on certain items but the sushi and hibachi is good and not too expensive. Saki bombs are cun there!"}
{"text":"Eat here at least twice a week I love this place, great food good customer service...decor is not great but to go is on point"}
{"text":"Just got up and left. They had roaches everywhere. I uploaded a pic.  As soon as I stood up, the waitress came over and asked if I had saw something, as if she already knew what I was gonna say. Then she tried to argue it was a bee. Really???  Never coming back."}
{"text":"The last few times I've visited, it seems as if they are using old grease or something because my panther rolls have been hard fried and greasy. Today was the worst. I ate what i could but ended up throwing the rest of it away.  The two stars was for the hibachi ramen that my wife loves. As for me, I think I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"I have been eating at ishi's for the past decade. This place always delivers consistently amazing food. Hibachi Steak and Chicken FTW!"}
{"text":"Let me first say that Ishi is THE best Japanese express restaurant that I have ever been to. I moved away from Charlotte a year and a half ago to Charleston, and afterwards to Jacksonville (FL), and haven't been able to find anything in comparison.   Ishi's food is always fresh, always tasty, and never disappoints. My go-to dishes are the Terriyaki Chicken and Terriyaki Steak. Today for lunch I got the Terriyaki Chicken with a side of ginger sauce, and it was everything I had remembered. The chicken is fresh and never dry, the broccoli is prepared in the typical hibachi fashion, and the sweet carrots are always a delight. Add their Terriyaki sauce, and you've found something close to heaven.  When I went to college at UNC Charlotte, I ate at Ishi once or twice a week (split time between Ishi and Toyama on Mallard Creek Church), and it's something I've missed over the past couple of years since moving away. The local college kids just don't know how good they have it!  I think it's also a good sign that some of the employees they had working today were there 2008 - 2010 when I was a \"regular\" during my college days."}
{"text":"My go to spot while in college and I still find myself going back years after I've graduated. Ishi has proved itself over and over to me. Never had a problem whether dining in or grabbing a plate to go. The people that work their are always nice and get the job done.   My go to order is always teriyaki chicken/steak and it's delicious. They have quite the sushi menu to order from but I have never tried. It's a good spot to get a good bit of food fast!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi and my hibachi pepper shrimp was very tasty. I think the ratings are bit lower than deserved."}
{"text":"While I'll admit that I haven't tried everything on the menu, my favorite thing to order here is the shrimp tempura maki roll. I've been to sushi places all over Charlotte, and none have compared to the taste of the shrimp tempura at this location! The maki roll is quite generous with the shrimp, which are a pretty good size, and extremely crisp too! While it's good on its own, I always like to order it with the shrimp sauce for dipping. For a little under $7 per roll, I'd say it's a steal for the quality!"}
{"text":"Our service was so-so. We had a waitress to start with who took my drink order wrong and then ignored our table. Then we had a new waitress who was nicer. Two at the table ordered sushi and two ordered hibachi (including myself). I ordered the vegetable hibachi (comes with broccoli, carrots, sweet carrots, zucchini, mushrooms, and onions with rice, I asked for no mushrooms or carrots). The sauce and vegetables was just okay, but definitely edible. However, the rice (listed on the menu as fried rice) was just cooked white rice that contained peas, carrots, and onions. Honestly, rice is a make it or break it for me, and I could not even eat half of this rice. Just so gross.  However, the sushi my friends ordered was pretty good! Definitely try the Little Mermaid roll, it was very tasty."}
{"text":"Went for a sushi lunch on recommendation of coworker. The decor is nothing special, unless tacky is special. Most patrons were eating hibachi lunch specials. I sat at the bar. I was waited on quickly and ordered my roll and nigiri from the friendly sushi chef. It was fresh, flavorful and reasonably priced. I won't go out of my way to come here again but I would eat here if in the area."}
{"text":"I have found this to be one of my favorite Japanese express restaurants.   The food is usually pretty quick and delicious.  I always get hibachi so I can't speak for the sushi but I have had friends who order that and seem to enjoy it as well.   Have t had a bad experience yet so I will keep going!"}
{"text":"came in and got to choose where i wanted to sit (awsome) the food was fresh and got it came out in 5 minutes. definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"I LOOVVE me some ISHI sushi! Talk about great quality of food and the amazing sushi chef that they have there.  I have been here several times and was quickly seated at the table and the waitress took our drink orders.  We ordered dumplings and several rolls.  The sushi here and the food here is amazing for the price and location."}
{"text":"Run down restaurant that doesn't inspire confidence. Floors are sticky. Sushi was chewy and not particularly flavorful. Fried rice side made with cheap frozen vegetables and tasted only of salt. I wouldn't return or recommend. Only plus was that service was fast and servers were polite."}
{"text":"I'm purely rating the sushi... but just to get it out of the way-  The Hibachi is whatever.  No, it's standard.  \"Whatever\" is not such a great word for reviews, I suppose.  And \"standard\" meaning, edible and makes you feel like a whale when you leave and by the time you get home, you're poke-out-belly starving.  The sushi, however, has always been on point for me and my husband.  The rolls are fantastic.  The rice has never been gummy.  The nigiri pieces are huge.  Prices are fair. And they make neat things out of oranges and fake leaves.  It's too bad, we live in the Matthews area... Sooo far - but worth the drive.  I gave it 4 stars because to be fair, I'm rating the restaurant and not just part of the restaurant's menu.  Hibachi - whatever.  Crap, no - Hibachi - standard.  Sushi - great."}
{"text":"It has been a little while since I have visited Ishi's.  Since I was in the neighborhood and was famished, I had to come back.  We ordered two tempura chicken rolls, a Bali Roll (mango, avocado and cucumber), and some fried rice with sweet tea.  Thank goodness for sweet tea (not a constant staple in the North)!  The tempura rolls were really good; the Bali Roll was something different and I enjoyed it.  The fried rice could have been fried more.  Overall, service was great as usual and the restaurant was not crowded between 1:30 - 2:30 pm which was great for us as the food arrived quickly.  I enjoy Ishi and was not disappointed during this visit."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped by here one Sunday morning for lunch while we were in town. We had gotten there a little early and the restaurant wasn't open yet. We were content to sit in the car and wait the 20 minutes or so before the restaurant officially opened but this little old man, who I am assuming to be the owner, was standing outside as we drove up and motioned for us to come on in. He then preceded to walk inside the restaurant and turn on the OPEN sign, still 20 minutes early. When most people were fine with having customers wait in the parking lot until opening time, which we were prepared to do, it was a sweet gesture.  The restaurant itself is pretty spacious and can accommodate large groups. The décor is a bit outdated but clean. And the food is typical Japanese food excellently prepared with reasonable prices. Ishi is very generous with their portion sizes in my opinion. After lunch, we were all in food comas and had for force ourselves not to drive home and take naps. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive even though we were there early and probably intruding onto their own lunchtime before starting their shifts. I will definitely have to come here again next time I'm in town and craving Japanese food."}
{"text":"good food  afortable prices, but service was a lil' Disorganized.  overall is a good place for dinner..!"}
{"text":"I'm floundering between 2 & 3 stars, but I'm feeling warm 'n fuzzy this evening, so I'm going with 3.  I used to eat at Ishi quite often, however it's been about a year since my last visit. Had nothing to do with them, just sorta happened that way (working from home a lot more, etc).  Since then, they've moved into a new building across from the strip mall they used to be in (formerly Fudruckers then Taiyo).  Much larger space, which is great , however the interior has sort of a \"design on a dime\" look to me.  Considering I got my lunch to go, I didn't have time to really evaluate things that closely, so I can't fairly evaluate/rate the ambiance, other than it being rather dark (lots of black).  I've eaten here twice now in the last week & a half, and I have to say, they just don't do it for me anymore.  And that saddens me because the family that owns/runs Ishi is great. Food is still fairly yummy, however the value isn't as good as it once was (ie: I've noticed a steep increase in price w/nothing to show for it).  Meals come with either a side salad or soup at other places, but not here.  I'm a creature of habit, so as usual, I order a chicken/shrimp hibachi combo.  $12.  Used to be around $8.  Portion sizes are plentiful, so kudos for that, and service is speedy and friendly.  However for my dollar, I can go about two blocks away to Kabuto and nosh on a far superior meal for the same price (and the rice is 10x better...and, if you have the time, you get a show!).  Granted, unlike many of their competitors, Ishi's pricing remains the same at dinner, so that's a plus (portion sizes are the same at lunch and dinner).    I tried their clear onion soup the other day and was RATHER disappointed; tasted like a watered down French onion soup to me - kinda icky; not the \"clean\" flavor I'm accustomed to.    All-in-all, Ishi is no longer on my go-to list unless I'm in a hurry or going with others.  If I do go, I think I'll just get Hibachi Shrimp & sub out the rice for zucchini & onion.  At least the owners & staff are still friendly - that get's them an additional star!"}
{"text":"This is a relatively big, warehouse-y looking place that has decent prices but average sushi.  Good location in the University area is probably the main reason it does a good amount of lunch business.    I had the Deluxe Sushi Platter and it was filling because the rice balls were HUGE!  The pieces of fish topping them were also large which required quite the mouth calisthenics to maneuver them (especially the more chewy pieces like the octopus).  I say make the pieces smaller so they're easier to eat and add another one to the platter to make up for the lost volume.  The rice was appropriately sticky but flavorless and a the temperature wasn't quite right.  It was just okay, but it'll do when jonesing for raw fish.  The three star average rating of this place is pretty much spot on."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of this place way back in the day, but I decided to go to lunch here today and found out they had moved!  Luckily, not too far away... it appears they've taken over a stand alone building in the same shopping center.  I cannot for the life of me remember what used to be here.  I need to come back and try their sushi again, but I had their Teriyaki Founder plate for lunch and it was great.  A good size plate of food that was very tasty and somewhat healthy.  Unfortunately I slathered on all the  shrimp sauce so, maybe it could have been healthy at one point.  I like the fact that the place is bigger so they can fit more people in, but it feels a bit \"too\" big if that makes any sense...  Also, I don't know how long ago they moved but there were some boxes and extra equipment that didn't seem correctly (just needs to be organized a bit).  There is a nice metallic blue color on the walls... but according to my color theory class in college, blue is an appetite suppressant.... That didn't necessarily stop me from eating as much as I did, but it was something I had in mind during the meal.  Overall a good lunch experience.  I'll have to get back here to try how their sushi is.  If I remember correctly it's a solid bet."}
{"text":"This place has some decent sushi for the University area. When you go inside the space is actually pretty big. They have lots of booths as well as tables and a couple bars. The decor and the booths and tables are a little bit older looking. Some of the booths have torn fabric. There is also this room off the of the dining room that looks like it's just used for storage. But all of it is pretty much in plain view. It's kind of weird.   The service is pretty good here usually. Last time my friend and I each ordered a beer to start. And then my friend switched to a soda and I ordered a water. My friend was asked if she would like a refill or a to go cup despite her soda was more full than my water and the server completely ignored my drink.   The price for the sushi is comparable to what you might expect at other sushi restaurants. Maybe a dollar or two cheaper on some of the rolls. The rolls here are all pretty good - but nothing spectacular or special. For that reason, whenever I am craving sushi I usually will opt to go to a different place. I usually only end up at Ishi if one of my friends chooses it."}
{"text":"By far some of the BEST fast food Japanese I've ever had, and probably will ever have. The staff is friendly to the predominantly college student crowd, always greeting and seating customers as soon as they come in. The atmosphere is fun, friendly, and inviting. Every time I've eaten here, dine in or carry out, the food is delicious and the service is quick and accurate.   When dining at Ishi, I strongly suggest that you dive head first into a plate of one of Ishi's succulent hibachi selections. With that being said I must admit, I'm a die hard Hibachi Chicken Addict! So much so, that the woman who works the register knows my dine-in and take-out orders to a tee, right down to my requests for no veggies and extra shrimp sauce. Now don't let my biased banter about the insanely delicious hibachi meals distract you from the plethora of scrumptious sushi selections Ishi has to offer. While I am not a sushi connoisseur, I must say that my friends who enjoy these savory seafood treats rave about their tasty goodness. Ishi's menu is chock-full of your Japanese food favorites, the only thing you have to do is make the painstaking decision of what you want to eat first.  While you're stuffing your face feel free to let your eyes wander around the restaurant. The ocean blue colored walls adorned with vibrant traditional Japanese decor provides a pleasant change from your everyday restaurant scenery. The bright white and smoldering black tables, chairs and booths add a casual elegance to the restaurant's atmosphere, making for an even more enjoyable dining experience. Ishi's convenient location to UNC Charlotte, and affordable prices make it the Hot Spot for college students and locals like myself. I definitely recommend this restaurant for everyone who loves Japanese food & rice done right! :) I know you'll enjoy it as much as I do!"}
{"text":"Done fast. Very good for the price. Had a drank and it was good. They weren't light with it. The staff was very kind and helpful. Outside smells like trash but their trash is right there. Over all I'd come back if in the area and hungry.   I got hibachi and no sushi just for the record.."}
