{"text":"I just went back and they had put green beans back on the menu but it is still high 9.71 for 2 ck and green beans.    What happened to the green beans!  And baked beans no one wants the nasty Cole slaw! And the prices are to high haven't been to a KFC in year because of that"}
{"text":"Not allowing an old lady to use your restroom!  I think it is illegal to not allow customers, visitors and guest to use the restroom in Nevada.  Building codes require them for a reason and your business is violating the law.   And putting those tacky signs all over the store does not change the law..."}
{"text":"I agree with all the 1 and 2 star reviews. This particular location just does not care about customers. I have had more than one bad experience and will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"The worst KFC I ever been to! Good customer service is nonexistent. I asked for honey... no honey. So I spent 30 minutes trying to eat their dry ass biscuit. I asked for my cookie that I bought with my hard earned money. And they said,\" oh we don't have any cookies.\" They could've told me that when I ordered something that included a cookie! I'm surprised that they didn't tell me that I couldn't order chicken because their FUCKING CHICKEN MACHINE WAS DOWN! Trying to pull a fast like McDonald's with their ice cream machine. Shake my head at this establishment. If I could give them 0 stars, I would. Also, I almost forgot one of the workers walked out from behind the counter with a cigarette in his mouth. Who does that?"}
{"text":"What is worse than driving all the way to the other side of mountains edge just to find out part of your order is missing , not getting an apology... even my 12 year old noticed that the could care less... he said \"wow, they did not even apologize...\" pretty sad but that is why the have 1 and a half stars ..."}
{"text":"Been to this place multiple times. Never left Yelp reviews or made complaints in 30 yrs but this place is an exception. 4 times in a row I recorded terrible service(one time I drove through with no service at all). Always wait times for food and even for taking the order. Always had to repeat myself multiple times. Always was still nothing but polite, and yet EVERY TIME my order was still wrong on top of it. Have taken this on the chin every time except last time. Where I drove all the way back to have them BLAME ME for the order. After straightening things out, they told me they ran out of BBQ sauce. When has any fast food chain ran out of something staple like sauce? Anyways, I shouldn't be eating shit food in the first place and but am relieved to see nothing but similar reviews on this page. Does KFC even monitor this feedback or even this store? What a shit show.."}
{"text":"This place is a complete joke!! It's ran by a bunch of kids that don't even know how to read the cash register, let alone make fried chicken!! Don't bother asking for extra crispy, they look at you like you just ask them for pizza. If you do manage to want what they have (because it seems like they are never making something ahead of time ) get real comfortable it could be a half hour before you get your fast food. I literally have no idea how they have managed to stay in business."}
{"text":"This is an update to a previous review. This location is apparently under new management. A woman named T or Miss T (something like that, woman with red hair last time we saw her) seems to be the new GM. We also found out that the girl who threatened to punch an employee (mentioned in the last review) is named April. Now this place is worse than before. The managers are still not friendly and most of the service is not welcoming. No only that the April girl mentioned in the last review now apparently attacked another employee. We heard that she threatened to choke the employee (and it seems that she actually did because my friend saw said employee the next day and she had pretty bad marks on her neck so it kind of makes you wonder... Remember this is the same April in our last review that we heard threatening to punch another employee. It seems to me this kind of activity should grounds for firing and in most employ manuals it is under their no tolerance policies. Hard to believe the new GM is even worse than the old one to let such things happen. That being said if ur a psycho I guess this is the place to work since they allow an employee to threaten and possibly attack people there. If you eat here be careful and bring some kind of protection!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible. 4 or 5 times they have forgotten parts of order while using drive thru.  This has not only happened to me but to my son and granddaughter .  Was promised $5 coupon this last visit, when arrived at store to pick up remainder of order told we don't have coupons we put you name in a book.  How professional is that?  I ask for a corporate number and no one could provide one.  This just can't be true that a store don't have a list of phone numbers?  Out of hot sauce too.  What kind of operation is this?  Very disappointed.  They have lost my whole family's business."}
{"text":"I would fire the manager of this KFC. Menu board has one price but they charge you another. 7 pm and they have no breasts of chicken and none cooking. Go somewhere else. These people are clueless."}
{"text":"Being somewhat close to the north strip this seems like a good fast food option but I would not recommend eating here. The service is terrible. We ordered a bucket of crispy chicken through the drive thru around 6pm (only car in line) and they gave us the wrong chicken. They also failed to give us all the sides we paid for. We were tired and didn't check the food until we got back to the hotel room. Tired, crying and disappointed kids is not something I wish on anyone. I won't be back here again."}
{"text":"Food is okay from this place delivery takes at least 70 - 80 minutes on the website they say it will take 50 minutes KFC is gone down on quality that's for sure and now customer service as well."}
{"text":"Terrible Terrible Service...always not having the chicken that you order off menu.I would think a fried chicken restaurant would have CHICKEN!!!
We quit going there...Awful!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why I continue to stop at this KFC. First visit food was great. Second visit we got home and bit into the biscuits and they were all raw dough. 3rd visit the forgot a couple items. 4th visit tonight I sat in the drive thru 4ever and then decided to go in. I witnessed the female manager arguing with a male employee who was using f-bombs!! Very unprofessional. The male employee clocked out and left!! I stood for awhile and I think they forgot my order. I was the only one standing and waiting. Place was empty. The service is slow, employees are unprofessional... I'm taking my business back to Canes. It's worth the drive!!!"}
{"text":"Sorry but one of the worst KFC's I've ever been to.  I don't know what they do but the chicken is overcooked and still greasy.  After waiting for the chicken to be ready is still seemed as if it had been sitting in a bin for quite a while."}
{"text":"I remember enjoying eating at an A&W one time I tried it, but this experience was nothing like that one.

First, I was in a large group. We could immediately tell this threw them off, but rather than handling it well they took 15-25 minutes for every order and most were done sloppily.

My fries and large root beer float took 12 minutes from the time stamp on my receipt. Not a single apology.

The fries had a stale chemical taste. The root beer float was abysmal. The ice cream was so gritty that I couldn't even drink half of it, despite my love for root beer floats.

After finishing my fries, I noticed a small bug walking across the wrapper.

I probably won't be in this area again, but this has deterred me from A&Ws in general. Terrible."}
{"text":"I've only been to this location twice but have no complaints.
First time I walked in because I haven't been to KFC in years and was unfamiliar with current pricing. I explained to the nice young man at the counter I needed chicken for 3 with mashed potatoes and gravy. Also, I needed 3 of the chicken pieces to be wings and I only had $20 to spend. He recommended a 9 piece leg and thigh bucket and he would substitute 3 wings for one of the thighs. We also got biscuits with the meal. All was fresh, hot and tasted great! And under $20. Young man was happy to have been of help and we had a great dinner.
My second visit I went through the drive thru. Had a question about what pieces were give for the selection I made. The lady on drive up window duty was, again, friendly and seemed happy to help. And, yes, great lunch. Hot, fresh and tasty!
I had stopped going to KFC years ago due to service and quality but I now will choose to go to KFC again."}
{"text":"Zero srars.  Over 10 people in there and no orders were being filled.  After waiting for 30 minutes I asked the cashier when we could expect some food.  The couldn't even find our order in the system.  Extremely disorganized!"}
{"text":"I love KFC,  my favorite place for chicken. 

however,  on my last 3 visits  my waiting time has been 10 or more minutes waiting in the drive thru. They take the  order pretty quick but the waiting for the food part, is ridiculous. They don't have grill chicken most of the time around 12:00pm. I still come to this location, because is the one closer to home and work."}
{"text":"I used to work a few KFCs in San Diego,
this place needs to clean up the parking lot... otherwise, it's awesome! wtg team!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Out of chicken at 5 pm on a tuesday? Bad management if any here. Spent s $40 on 11 drumsticks, 3 wings and 2 thighs on a 16 piece meal. Then all the breading fell off the chicken before we could eat. Very greasy and very sad. Either kfc don't care or this manager don't care... it shows"}
{"text":"I have had good experiences here. I run a business across the street and take out food once a week to my home where we don't have a KFC close by. I ordered a three piece meal asking for a breast, wing and drumstick. Guess what? Two thighs and a wing... $10 after tax and I get two effin thighs? 
One of the workers was having a fit because she was told to make more pot pies. With minimum wage at $10 an hour, I would think staff selection could be more efficient."}
{"text":"Bought bucket last night containing four of the worst chicken breasts and several wings that were not edible."}
{"text":"Had the bucket of chicken with biscuits, mash potatoes, macaroni cheese. Everything was fresh and warm.  A gentlemen even gave us cookies.  Great food and service."}
{"text":"This location is the worst in all of beautiful 'merica. We have used the drive thru on 6 separate occasions in a period of 4 months when we first moved to this neighborhood. EVERY time they forgot items for our order or gave us completely wrong food. Called a couple times to give 'em some feedback without being rude. It has been 2 years now since they screwed up our last order because we don't go there anymore. This Taco Bell/KFC is a mile from our house but we much rather drive 3 miles further and visit the other locations."}
{"text":"Where do I start?! This particular location is always out of chicken or the sides that I want. They are rude and the biscuits are hard as a rock. The last time I went the lady that took my order didn't put the lid on my gravy all the way and ruined my jeans and her greedy self had a wing in her mouth. Just overall blahhhh!"}
{"text":"As usual at this location they got my order wrong. I ordered an extra crispy 3 piece meal to dine in. The cashier gives me a bag with a box in it. Then as he walks by he goes Oh sorry my bad when he sees me sitting at a table. I open the box and lo and behold its not extra crispy.  I go back and I get the same response. Sorry my bad. Its not like they were busy. I was the only  customer there when I ordered. And KFC. Why do I always have to ask for butter for my biscuit. Who eats biscuits without butter or honey. You would think for the outrageous prices they charge they could get my order right and put some butter with my meal.. For the price they charge I could get  a fried chicken meal in a sit down restaurant. I am done with KFC. Its amazing they stay in business. Oh, and I had to reach over the counter to get my receipt because the moron behind the counter forgot to give it to me."}
{"text":"I had the worst service I have ever got at a kfc the drinks did not have co2 on them the food was either half portions or missing I got no receipt I got take out so when my wife called back they kept picking up the phone and hanging up when they finally picked up the manager Laura was really disrespectful she made it such a hustle to get our meal replace and she refuses to replace all of it even thou they advertise that if its not colonel quality they would replace it if you get the same shitty service I recommend you call 1800 225 532 that's the corporate number"}
{"text":"This place sucks! I don't come to kfc very often but when I do they never have grilled chicken!!!! Ever!!!! The guy tells me it'll be 15min, So fine I'll wait 15 min. Then I pay at the window and the manager lupe says it'll be 20min! How does one person say 15 min now you're telling me 20!? And did nothing to compensate or make me a happy customer! Don't go here !"}
{"text":"Gone there twice both times no oven roasted chicken and they would rather send me to another kfc than have it on hand"}
{"text":"Not even worth 1 star!  This place was awful!  Dining area was filthy.  Food was cold.  Biscuit was rock hard. Restrooms were foul!  Food prep areas were a mess. Im hoping a video will post on here soon."}
{"text":"The food is good and this time the staff was quick with the service. However, I believe this location is privately owned, which is the reason for the low review. You charge .39 cents to use a debit or credit card???  Who does this? This is the only business in a 10 mile radius that charges. If you're going to eat here you better being cash with you."}
{"text":"Very nice staff, not such a clean place maybe they could clean a little more than talking.... But all in all it is KFC and it was good.."}
{"text":"Came here ~30 minutes prior to closing expecting terrible service, and got the complete opposite. The drive through had a brief delay, but they got our order of popcorn nuggets, potato wedges, sierra mist, 1 extra crispy breast, mashed potatoes, biscuit, and Pepsi out quickly. They threw in an extra biscuit because the were out of cookies, and it was the best biscuit I've ever had at a KFC. Thanks! All of the food was very fresh and had the right amount of crispiness to it. We will definitely be back. Thanks for proving theres hope at KFC."}
{"text":"Rude, disgusting place. They cut you off as you are ordering. They yell at you while you are ordering as well. I sat behind ONE car and waited about ten minutes. I finally pulled away. 

I have never had a pleasant experience here. The people that work there are the lowest of the low. They consistently have attitude and get mad when you ask for sauce. When you see this place, drive on."}
{"text":"I have never ever got my food correct here. However the most shocking thing is I ordered the chicken little combo and received two tiny buns with mayo and pickles for 7 dollars. When I went inside to correct my order and it was so dirty and gross."}
{"text":"Stopped at KFC around 3pm today and thought was a good time because they weren't busy so I hey would not be out of product. Problem is, we bought the tenders meal and I think they gave probably been sitting there since lunch because they are all dried out. Then once hone we discovered the biscuits were missing. Looked at the receipts they gave me and there were two different phone #s - one no one answered and the other went right to voicemail. No wonder Canes is so successful with service like this."}
{"text":"Do not go to this location. Against my better judgement I ignored the prior bad reviews hoping I would have a better experience (since this location is the closest one to me). Nope. Got home to find my 8 piece half extra crispy/half grilled dark meat only was half grilled/half original with both white and dark meat."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time here. Customer service is bad and food was cold. Store says open at 10 but they actually don't start anything till 10:30...."}
{"text":"Maybe if you get the order right I wouldn't have to drive back and forth!! Train customers service pls!"}
{"text":"After a few visits that were far from exciting, I decided to give them another chance.  It was on the fly, had a group of teen girls that needed fed.  I ordered the 20 pc meal, 2 mash, 2 slaw, and 1 mac.  The sides were fine, yet hard to screw up pre-made side items.  The biscuits were hot, yet oddly enough....Half of them were only the top half.  The chicken, the meat of the meal and matter, was 11 thighs, 2 breasts, 3 legs, and 1 wing.....An odd bird, considering it should have been a straight 5 pieces each.  My family doesn't really care for the thighs, daughter likes legs and wings, wife and I are breast people (yes, I know how that sounds).  We figured the dogs would like the thighs, so you can imagine our thought when the one piece we were tolerating dominated the bunch.

I walked back in the store, and everyone that has ever worked behind a restaurant counter KNOWS, that when a strange person walks into the store with restaurant bags....It isn't a good sign.  So when she asked what I wanted, I politely asked for the MOD.  She didn't understand, I asked again but for the Manager on Duty.  She still did not or choose not to understand me.  I then asked 6 more times, it was a really bad game of whose on first.  To the point that the other customers were laughing.  The General manager came out, and I explained the situation.  He politely said he would fix the situation.  Packed up 5 breasts and sent me on my way.  I wasn't thrilled, but didn't want to waste my day on this.

Upon arriving home, finally getting the chance to eat myself, I put one on the plate with some mashed.  The exterior of the chicken looked fine, but the minute I took a bit and started to chew, the rancid flavor and odor hit me.  After excusing myself for thirty minutes to the bathroom, I returned to examine the chicken.  The exterior and 1/2 inch into the chicken looked normal.  The remaining interior of the chicken was a complete mushy mess....That chicken was so far from it's sell by date that I can't believe I didn't catch it on first examination.  I will say though, it has been hours, and I still have not been able to get that taste out of my mouth or get my stomach settled.....And I was in the Army, and have a pretty tough stomach, but rotten chicken....

Now to add insult to injury, I was exceedingly polite to both the drive thru teller for the extreme wait, and the store manager because I explained to them that I once was a KFC GM and DM.  So I knew what it was like to be in their shoes.  So if anything I hope this review has a bit more weight, I know what the standards are at KFC and know that this location falls far short of them, to the point of it being a safety issue.

What is sad, this cost forty bucks, 2 hours of my time and who knows how long to recover.  It was a far cry from Hot, Fresh, and Fast.  Just glad I got to the rancid chicken before my family did."}
{"text":"This meal was very poor. The chicken was all batter and it was just bad. Won't make that $11 mistake again."}
{"text":"A veteran walked up and asked for a veteran discount and he did not get one even though he served our country. Also the lady working was giving me attitude about giving me the wrong side when i told her she gave me the wrong one and she forgot my sauce and still gave me attitude."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Wonderful staff. Fast fresh food everytime. Acknowledged right when you walk in. Chicken was fabulous."}
{"text":"Why'd I stop here!? Lazy I guess. Lazy enough to make a fools mistake. There has to be an answer for these fast food restaurant debunk management. Walked in and an employee was sitting at a table engrossed with her smart phone. Went to the soda service and no kids for my M drink. Walked out and a different employee was sitting looking at her smart phone. Still no lids. One thing... the workers were real nice so I added a star. 2 1/2 is pushing it tho"}
{"text":"This is perhaps the worst KFC meal I've ever experienced. You could cave squeezed  two teaspoons of oil out of each piece of the extra crispy chicken. My experience was so bad I'm switching to churches."}
{"text":"This is the closest location to my house so we've given it about 10 tries in hopes that it would get better, it only gets worse so we've finally given up. Every single order we've made has been wrong with missing or different items. The chicken strips are always dry and mostly batter, they give attitude if you ask for fresher chicken. They often ask us to wait or ask us to change our order to something that they have already made. I complained and got a gift certificate as compensation, the chicken we got with it was quite literally just a fried piece of skin that was see through when held up to the light. How sad is that? It can't imagine someone making that and thinking it was ok to give to a customer."}
{"text":"This was the first time I had been to KFC since perhaps my high school years and now I know why:

Food: C-   I had the 'Big Crunch' sandwich. First of all it wasn't really crunchy in a good way, it was crunchy in a hurt-your-jaw kind of way. Secondly, it really wasnt that big either considering that half of it was weird \"crunchy\" batter/chicken skin. Lastly, the chicken tasted really weird, not sure what it was but it was bad enough that I couldn't eat any more than half the sandwich. 

Service: Quick (lived up to the fast food name, but there was no one else there)

Food presentation: B-  

Atmosphere: D  This place doesn't even have any seats!

Prices: B+  Pretty cheap but who cares if you can't even finish it.

Recommended?:  Is that a serious question?"}
{"text":"Went to the drive thru. Ordered #3,5 and 6. When i got my order there's only #5 and #6 and was told to park at the front for #3. I checked the box and it's both #5. Decided to went back inside to tell the girl the other box of food is wrong. She then grabbed the plastic bag and and give me another bag and said \"This is the correct order\". I went out and drive home and when i opened the bag the cookies that comes with #5, 6 is not there. I was already upset by the mixed up but decided to go back to let them know it was missing the cookies. I went to the counter and said this is messed up, and I'm missing the cookies. The lady came up to me, she looks like the manager but she have gave me a bad attitude. She said i'll just give you the cookies without even apologizing for the mistake. And i told them they should double check the orders and this lady just throw the cookies in my bag while walking away and babbling some words. Very disappointing. Bad customer service. I will never come back. To the owner of this branch, the manager is not good for your business."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst KFC I have ever been to. Ordered a box combo with a leg and a thigh.  Get home and see I got a wing and a thigh instead. If that wasn't bad enough the cookie was laying by the chicken and soaked up the grease like a sponge.  Tossed the whole thing will never go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst KFC ever! Employees do not care about customers at all. Gave this place another chance today during dinner only to be told it was at least a 30 minute wait for chicken. Are you kidding me? No chicken, at dinner, at a chicken place? And not remotely crowded! If the employees could get off their phones and butts and earn their minimum pay... since that will NEVER happen do yourself a favor - avoid this place at all costs!"}
{"text":"Really poor service. Overcharged $0.39 in drive thru without explanation. Ordered plain $5 Fill-Up with no add-ons or upgrades, was charged $7.96. Then no biscuit or cookie in the bag when I got home. Drum stick was missing half the meat on one side of drumstick. I am really let down. I used to like KFC. Not anymore. Too many good places to choose from."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this kfc to pick up a quick chicken  dinner.  The person taking our order was friendly and offered suggestions. The establishment was very clean and we got our food with in minutes of ordering. The chicken dinner dinner and pot pie meals we had were very good. We were pretty surprised that the reviews were so poor.  Considering we eat out a lot and seldom at fast foods restaurants,  this was a very acceptable dinner."}
{"text":"Went to KFC for the first time in years. Most fast food places forget something or give u the wrong order on occasion so I rarely use drive thru. 

I entered KFC & was greeted by a lovely young lady with a big smile. She was patient with me trying to figure out what to order since I didn't have a friggin clue as to the menu She made a suggestion which worked out great.

The lady who packed my order was all smiles & very pleasant. Order was right. Was given plenty of sauces.

This location was spotless. 

The food was fine. Still HOT when I got it home & on the table.Chicken was crispy & perfectly cooked.  Biscuits were perfect, mac n cheese lasted all of 3 minutes on the table, coleslaw about 5 minutes. Kids were happy. A tiny bit salty (for me) but actually about the best fast food fix I've had in a long time. 

Will definitely return next time we need a junk food fix."}
{"text":"I have never went to this location and had a good experience yes I will agree that they are clean at the same time, i went thru the drive thru and they're very rude more than one  person was taking my order a girl and a dude  most of the time they don't get my order right I get something I never ordered and I feel that is not good customer service if you are asked is that it after every item you order, I've went back to this location only because it's very close to home  but my last visit the chicken  I got it did not taste very good and had a very weird taste so ive decided  I will no longer be returning to this locations it would more worth my time to travel out of my way to get better customer service"}
{"text":"What's happened to KFC (I hope it's just this location)? I was just taken for $28.00. Totally disgusted.Ordered the Family Fill-up Bucket and Tender Fill-up box. Had to throw most of it out. I would have returned it, but it's Christmas Eve and stopped because I was busy and no time to cook with everything going on. 6:30 pm and it appears all I got was leftovers. The bucket of chicken was heavily breaded and soaked in grease, nothing crispy about it. The gravy on the mashed potatoes was like rubber, thick skim on top of dried out, pasty potatoes. Hockey pucks for biscuits and 3 rock hard chicken nuggets passed off as chicken tenders. Seriously they were no bigger than a 50 cent piece. All 3 laid next to each other didn't even add up to what one tender should be. Not to mention they were mostly all breading. So I ended up spending $28.00 for a drink and side of coleslaw (which was good). Buyer beware, you've been warned."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and excellent food. Chicken breast was well done and crisp just like I like it!  Cole slaw was yummy and you could even taste just the right amount of onion. Very unusual for a KFC.  Mashed potatoes and gravy were tasty. Arrived at about 5 pm. Chicken was fresh. This was the first KFC I have eaten in North Carolina since arriving from California in June 2016. We quit eating it in California because chicken was always undercooked. Great work KFC Cornelius!!!  We will join you again soon."}
{"text":"Decided to try this one again after 6 months. Bad mistake. 

I went through the drive-thru yesterday and ordered a 16 piece family meal. Extra crispy. \"Sorry sir. All we have is white meat in extra crispy so would you like to pay the extra for it?\"  Huh???  How is that my problem that you are low on inventory?  My other option was to wait 8 minutes at the drive-thru for the chicken to be done so I gave up and got half original half crispy. 

Then at the window I see a notice that I'll be charged an extra $0.35 for using a debit card. I didn't think anything of it since I was charging it, not using debit...hence the visa logo. Low and behold they tacked the extra charge on it anyway.  I called visa and they asked for the address so they could look into their merchant account. 
after that I got home and noticed that my side of sweet corn was missing...even after asking the person at the window if everything was in there.  
Sigh. 

Went back to the store to get my corn and the counter girl asked me if i was in today or yesterday. Showed her my receipt, listened to her tell the line team they forgot another item, then she gave it to me and apologized.  Nice to get an apology but after coming back after getting home it would have been a nice gesture to offer something extra. 

Got back home and noticed that there were no butter or honey with the order either.  At this point I gave up. 

Food was ok but nothing special. By the time I actually got to eat it the crispy and regular tasted about the same.  Guess I'll try again in another 6-12 months.  Place really sucks."}
{"text":"I LOVE me some KFC. Don't get me wrong. This is the nearest location from my house, so I go here when I want a KFC Famous bowl. Those things are the best. However, I have to give this place 1 star because the service is absolutely deplorable. I go in to order, and every time I have been there in the last 6 months there has been no one at the counter ready to take care of customers. I finally place my order, but it usually takes between 20-40 minutes for the employees to remember that someone is sitting in their dining area and that they did, in fact, order food. It is not unusual for the employees to service 3-4 drive-thru customers before anyone inside the store. And usually, people end up coming back to complain because their order was wrong. Disgraceful. I used to work in fast food and customer service, and from what I see, there is clearly a management problem at this location. The food is good, just not worth a half hour wait.

Additionally, there is one thing I have noticed. Inside, the customers fill their own soft drinks from a pop machine that is not the one used for the drive-thru. I stop getting soft drinks from inside the restaurant because that particular machine gives an odd aftertaste to the drinks. Again, from working in food service, that might indicate that the machine is not being cleaned, or it is not being cleaned PROPERLY. Don't take your chances, get water instead."}
{"text":"Me&hubby needed a fast lunch - haven't been to KFC in years - stopped in. I don't like when the cashier WAITS at the register for you to look over the menu. Like I said we haven't been in for years and needed to look over menu. We were the only ones in line and asked questions that I am not sure the guy understood. He'd say something then someone from the back said something too. Confusing! Finally deciding on the Chicken Littles, we asked for 1 side of mashed potatoes
 and 1 of cole slaw.Of course, when we got home there were 2 cole slaws. Idk - there are SO very many places to go for a bite - think we are done with KFC for another few years."}
{"text":"Got my usual honey BBQ sandwich today and was disgusted by the quality. The chicken tasted like it was from the day before and not to mention the way the lady at the register acted when I ask to just get some chicken instead. She looked like I ask her to eat the sandwich! I then just said never mind and walked out to drive over next door to Tacobell where I spent an additional $6.00 to eat lunch. I def will not be returning to KFC on warm springs. Did I mention I was the only customer in the store and they seemed to be too busy with drive thru to worry about the front counter. I waited 6-7 minutes at the counter before I was told I would be helped in just a min. Oh well... Can't win them all I guess"}
{"text":"Well here it goes. Every time I have been to this location it's the same ol' thing. I place my order and then I am told they are out of chicken and it will be a 25 minute wait to cook more. That explains the little exit drive out of the drive thru just past the order board! So this time I ordered a 12 piece chicken only. Of course they didn't have it and they offered me 6 wings and 6 breasts. Of course it was mixed recipes. What a crock! The only reason I took the deal is I didn't have time to run across town looking for another chicken joint plus I had starving teenage boys at home waiting to devour this chicken. I was pissed. I paid for the chicken and was told my receipt would be in the bag. Of course when I got home...no receipt! I'm sure it was due to the fact they knew I was going to fill out their survey. This KFC SUCKS 
A$$! I will NEVER go back! I have been told the Fry's grocery store has good fried chicken. I hope Church's Chicken comes to the area soon....it has to be better than this place. Hopefully they will put them out of business!!!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED."}
{"text":"This location is the closest one to where I work. I decided to partake in their chicken fried steak deal since they only offer it on Mondays (which I find odd). When I arrived at the drive thru, I had to wait about 10 minutes total before I made it to the window. The car in front of me had to wait to order and when they finished, I had to wait as well. When the girl taking orders was finally ready for me to order, I said I'd have the chicken fried steak meal. She confirmed it and told me it would be $3.60. I pulled up, waited for the person in front of me to get their order and leave, and finally made it to the window. When I got there, the girl looked at me with a funny face and said, \"I forgot your order.\" Again, I stated, \"the chicken fried steak meal.\" I only saw two employees in the restaurant, both young ladies. The one taking orders, took my card (they charge .39 cents if you use your card) had me sign a receipt, gave my card back, and vanished from the window. The other girl packed up my food and placed it by the window. She saw I was watching and when she realized the girl taking orders wasn't coming back, she handed me my food. The coleslaw container was in the bag sideways, I had to right it to avoid a spill. It ended up costing me $3.99 with the charge for the card, but I did not get a copy of that. My receipt only says $3.60. Despite the problems ordering, and the extra fee for the card, I rated 3 stars because I still find this to be a good deal for the chicken fried steak meal, and the food was really good. It took my entire lunch break (30 minutes) to get there, get my food, and get back to work. I'm not sure it's worth it in the long run, and I'm sure they could make ordering via the drive thru more efficient."}
{"text":"***Heads up today 3/7/15
They have a girl working the drive through who seems very very sick.  Idk how much food she handles but just a heads up."}
{"text":"Why isn't less than 1 star a possibility?  We try this every now and again, thinking it's got to be better.  This was just a one bad night.  Well, that's it.  Service is too long, employees don't know their menu, the place is warm, service is terrible, and the food is not that great to begin with.  We have had ore bad experiences here so we won't go back."}
{"text":"Disgusting! As if incorrect orders weren't enough....we just found the chicken sticker baked into the pot pie!-gross!!!! Never again"}
{"text":"This location is the worst.  Check your order before leaving because they never get it right.
Chicken is also very skinny, must have changed suppliers, did not seem that tiny previously.
My advice avoid this location like the plague, it is terrible.  Owner should be replaced, obviously never spends any time supervising or training employees.  Forget trying to call to complain, no voice mailbox setup and no one answers phone.  I am 100% done with this location."}
{"text":"I don't want to give this place any stars at all they rip you off on the product I was in there about a month ago unordered there 8 piece special my chicken wings breast and thighs were so small my bird would look at it and ask where is the meet I went into the store the next day explained what happened to the manager I cannot produce my receipt because my car was stolen and I explained to her that I had to wait for my American Express statements come back in the mail before I could do that she told me ok no problem she would leave a message in the office well I went back with my American Express statement and the one manager there knew nothing about it she has apparently spoken to the other manager and she said she doesn't remember me and that there is nothing that they could do for me all I want is like for breast out of the $21 that I spent at this place and they will not accommodate so beware of going to this location"}
{"text":"First time today eating McDonald's in a year or so. I use to go to a bad Mcdonald over there on lake mead . And I use to always always get old cold food every time no matter what time we went so I stopped eating and I went to 5 other bad locations after. But today I was happy with the service and fresh food for once. I live 5 minutes away and my food was still hot."}
{"text":"The problem here is not really the food.  It's  KFC, if you like their fare, you're in luck.  The problem here is the employees.  They hold that delicious chicken hostage!  Tonight, I waited  25  minutes to place my order in the  drive thru.  The girl on the other end of the  mic, Jordan, couldn't get the simple order correct to save her life.  I pulled forward, or tried to, and  in  another  20 minutes, made it to the window.  That's where the fun began.  Jordan was pretty surely.  I don't like that.  She corrected my order, yelled at the cook to add what she had forgotten, and gave me my food.  No  apology for  waiting  45  minutes.  No  silverware.  No napkins  for  my  finger lickin' fingers.  No sauce for the chicken strips.  I asked if she had  any sauce, she said yes, if  I asked for  it.  That's when I lost it.                       I went into the restaurant and spoke to the manager, a nice lad, who might be able to shave in  a year or so.  He told me he  would \"discipline\" Jordan.  I looked over at her smirking face, and noticed her drive thru stand was full of food crumbs  and  she had  a beverage with  a straw.  She rolled her eyes some more, and I called her  a brat.  Mature? No.  However, I feel it was justified.  After all, I just lost  45 minutes of my life waiting for her to hand me my chicken.              Moral of the story...it's a KFC, and the food is fine.  However, the  agravation of having to deal with snotty  teenagers, and  wasting  my time is not worth it, and I'll never go there again."}
{"text":"Too bad this is the only KFC option in the area.  The employees consistently get your order wrong.  Two weeks ago we made the mistake of giving them another try only to get home (a 4 mile oneway trek) to have been shorted our large coleslaw side.  I phoned the manager who promised to replace it at no cost the next time we come in.  So we tried to phone ahead to make pick-up easier only to be informed that they are out of wings which they won't replace with breast pieces unless you pay an additional charge.  Now I don't understand this approach as it isn't the customers fault they have run out of an item.  The manager I had spoken with previously was not in and the one I had on the line wouldn't budge on their additional charge policy even though this was an attempt to collect on their previous screw-up.  Apparently they feel they can continue to do business this way as they are the only one \"nearby\"."}
{"text":"One star because there is no ZERO star.....

Boring and inattentive to customers, lousy service and bland tasting chicken is all you need to know about this place.

I stopped in for chicken this week. I remember how the KFC chicken used to taste, but was sadly disappointed in the quality of the food.

The service was terrible with 3 wrong orders in a row
They ran out of breasts and tried to sub out thighs on one gentleman
Gravy was like paste
Potatoes were like runny  - can't say it in words - would get banned - you get the idea

If you can run, run as fast as you can away from this store. I am not sure the manager is aware of the quality problems, but should be notified. Order taking is akin to having wisdom teeth taken out without Novocain.

I cannot say thanks for the experience, truly disappointed. The Coronel should be turning in his grave. Sorry."}
{"text":"The worst fast food service I have ever received. I was asked what I ordered 3 different times at the drive thru order box and then twice more when I got to the window and it was still wrong. Took us about 20 mins total just to get through a drive thru. The food was bad as well. Overly salted and kinda rubbery and cold."}
{"text":"always loving it. i have low service expectations for a fast food place but you guys go above and beyond on this"}
{"text":"Drive thru for a chicken share box and been told I need to park and wait for 10 mins lol. And I'm end up only waited for 14 mins. Not bad."}
{"text":"FOOD:
We always have a pretty good experience at all KFC locations. At this one, however, we did not. We ordered the \"$5 Fill Up: Chicken Breast\". We mostly got what we paid for in the sense that no items were missing from our order. Two things were disappointing though: 1) When my husband (who's always the faster eater) said: \"mm, I love this ice cream\" and I looked up and realized the amount and presentation of the mashed potatoes made it look like a single ice cream scoop with some syrup poured over it and it's nowhere near the usual \"single serving\"/\"small side\" size. 2) The chicken \"breasts\" were tiny and had dark, greasy meat. My guess (without actually breeding or chopping up chickens on a regular basis) is that we got thighs. They were tiny and the amount of meat compared to the usual breast was about 1/3. 

STAFF/LOCATION:
I also felt bad for the one person working the counter. He obviously didn't have time for everyone, taking orders, putting them together, serving. After we ordered and sat down for a while, I heard what sounded like a knocking a few times and I realized what looked like a mirror on the wall above us was actually a dark and highly reflective window looking out from the kitchen. Our server was knocking at us to come pick up our food! I went over to the counter and told him \"oh, I thought I heard something\" and he handed over the food and that was it. Funny! Obviously, he didn't have time to come out and hand it to us, nor did he have any help. I couldn't see how well staffed the rest of the place was, but it might be safe to assume they were understaffed too. The lobby was pretty clean though and even the bathroom wasn't too bad for a public one."}
{"text":"WORST KFC ever. No utensils & mashed potatos was soup. Chicken pieces small  Waste of money and time. Horrible service."}
{"text":"Not always the fastest service, but typical KFC fare.  Love that original recipe!  Great cole slaw.   Delicious corn."}
{"text":"Totally didn't get what I ordered.   Had to go back.  No apologies from anyone.  Treated me like I made it up.  Need a management shake up.  Not the first time this has happened."}
{"text":"I can say the place is cleaning,That's about it. Food cold as the pop. The manager yelling. I'll head the other way to poppeyes, on Loraine road."}
{"text":"I just want to this KFC and my experience here was horrible. I waited in the drive thru for 15 minutes to get my food. The service was horrible and the employees weren't very friendly. I will defiantly not be coming back to this KFC. Also, there was fowl strong oder that smelled like sewage."}
{"text":"How the shit do you run out of extra crispy, original recipe, and pot pies at the same time?"}
{"text":"After years of forgetting about KFC I got a 2 fer coupon and decided to try it again.  Order was wrong but  2nd star because she was cute and friendly. Food has changed so much from 30-40yrs ago and not for the better. Even the famous gravy is watery and not the same. 

Sorry Popeyes, I'll never ever cheat on you again."}
{"text":"Ok KFC is done in my books. I don't know how they manage to stay open because it has become a joke. So over the last 5 years I say I have went to maybe KFC 8 times. In those 8 times, all 8 times, they did not have any dark meat left. You are a chicken place, YOU SHOULD HAVE FREAKING CHICKEN IN A CHICKEN PLACE! Every time I had to get white meat. I like dark meat because it taste way better to me. Anyways I went to this KFC and the same thing happened. I was just soooooo annoyed. I told them to just shove it. Yea I shouldn't had said that, but it's beyond frustrating when that happens every time you go.

So I went to another KFC. Here is the link of that review. I see why they are falling behind other chicken places. https://www.yelp.com/biz/kfc-apache-junction?hrid=tSWhirzevpKosSGvbKg45g"}
{"text":"Every time I go there I wish not to meet the manager but unfortunately he is working over there most of the time. He is rude and I give 0 score to his customer service."}
{"text":"Lifeless extra crispy wings and what must have been yesterdays leftover thighs and drumsticks in original, served at 10:30am. Its obvious KFC is Yum brand's red headed stepchild these days. . Seriously I've seen high school dissection projects with more appeal than those tortured nephilim inspired drumsticks, does the FDA actually approve this stuff for sale to people?

The colonel must be turning over faster than his bastardized legacy products, if you don't want an overprocessed pressed chicken patty between two lifeless bread buns you're in the wrong place, cause the chicken with bones in it isn't what KFC cares about these days. As authentic as that small government party that doesn't want anyone protesting their never ending government enforced cronyism."}
{"text":"I recently had a great experience at the Fort Mill KFC.  The lady who took my order offered a smaller combo bucket/ side that wasn't currently on the menu, and better fit what I was looking for.  I don't normally expect someone to be so helpful at a fast food place.  She did a great job, and I was most impressed.  While not everyone there is as talented as this lady was, I have never had anyone be rude to me.  The orders have been consistently correct.  As a side note, I visit maybe once a quarter, or every six months or so, and I usually go in to make sure my order is clear.  Thanks Yelp for allowing me to share my opinion."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time at this particular KFC. The first time was fine, but this time around...I waited about 7-8 minutes for my food! They were behind on the sides or something...and I'm not sure if this is normal for KFC or it's just this particular location, but the food was ...unsatisfying. 

I was disappointed with the amount of salt used to season the chicken. I couldn't taste anything but salt, salt and more salt. 

The cole slaw was a bit old and overly sweet. Overall a very bad meal that I will remember long enough to avoid KFC. I'd rather have chicken at McDonald's."}
{"text":"So, this review is not so much about the restaurant as a whole, but the food.
So, after seeing the commercial about their spicy chicken sandwich,  we couldn't wait to give it a try.  The drive thru is super slow, but that is always the case. The sandwich, where do I start?? Lame, Dry, not spicy AT ALL, DRY. The bun was dry, the lettuce wilted salad, that looked like it was the last of a bag of lettuce. And, that was it. No mayo, or sauce to compliment the chicken. Nothing. I not sure if it is supposed to be like that or our sandwiches were incomplete. I do know that it was a waste of money, and I immediately felt as of we should have gone some where else. I don't really see KFC getting anymore of my hard earned money."}
{"text":"This is the worst KFC I've ever had. The grilled chicken was so dry I couldn't even swallow it and the potato wedges were so soggy when picked up they broke into pieces. I'd rate this zero stars if I could. If you want chicken go to the jack in the box across the street."}
{"text":"The food made me very sick. It was good but I have the worst time of my life at the moment."}
{"text":"Only pleasant experience about going to this kfc/taco bell was the friendly cashier.  The store smelled like pee and the lady that gave us our food was very rude.  Charging for utensils, really!!!  The chicken was very undercooked there was still blood on the inner meat and bones...Never going back to this kfc ever again."}
{"text":"Well this KFC has always been super friendly , food on the other had is Okay... let me explain I always get the same thing at this KFC the Honey BBQ Sandwich very good!! but when I get the meal deals I run into trouble the meat is sometimes under-cooked which is really bad when you are cooking chicken."}
{"text":"Usually they screw up the order and then give attitude when you ask them to fix it.  We are in the building right now and it's cooler outside,  no A/C, freakin hot. 
Don't seem like they care,  not site we'll be back to this one"}
{"text":"I've never waited longer for a bucket of fried chicken. The employees really couldn't move any slower. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I wish there was a half star. I went at 6:00 and waited 10mins and received no service. I looked around the corner and what a dirty mess on the floor where they were cooking chicken. I immediately left. I would be scared to eat at this place."}
{"text":"Worst kfc ever. Went on a slow night, the drive threw guy was rude. Waited forever on our food. Didn't get the order right.!!!"}
{"text":"You could go here, but you would be better off taking a cheese grater to your nipple.

Do you enjoy standing at the counter for 20 minutes just waiting to order? Do you like your order always being screwed up? Do you like it when an employee tells you that they are out of something 15 minutes after you ordered it?

Then I have the place for you!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The worst  people work here,and never have what's on the menu! Customer service is very rude the employees there don't care! I've gone to this KFC for many years and I will never never go back again. Don't trust their food don't trust what they would do their food!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, it was cold and took over an hour to arrive. Too much wrong with this experience to go into detail but please follow me on Instagram @hughbetcha"}
{"text":"Got 2 5 dollar fill ups today and they gave me 1 leg when it says 2 and for the famous bowl there no gravy ... Someone needs to do there job properly ..."}
{"text":"This KFC never has the chicken you want ready.  The staff and customers are awful.  The dining room is often hazy with smoke flowing out of the kitchen.  I go here only because it's close to work and sometimes I really want a side or sandwich which they usually have."}
{"text":"This is quite possibly the most lackluster Kentucky Fried Chicken in the valley.  I have been going here for years due to their proximity to my house, but I am now convinced it is not worth the supposed convenience.  The wait times are long (up to 20 minutes) they sometimes claim to be 'out of' chicken on the night shift, and the drive-thru staff are neither particularly polite nor attentive to the details of the order.  I have been disappointed so many times (most recently this week) that my wife and I have decided to swear off this particular store.  It's just not worth any perceived savings of time."}
{"text":"It's no LoLo's but it got me over a fried chicken craving, I'd give this 2.5 stars if I could. I don't think KFC is as good as it used to be, but hard to say since my palate has certainly refined over the years. The gal at the drive thru was very friendly, so there's my bonus .5 star."}
{"text":"Nothing is more exasperating than gettin short ordered and you find out when you get home!  They have these kids working there who just don't give a sh* t and couldn't care less cause they have their heads up their butts.  Not worth it to go back for the extra side I ordered but it will cost them more than that with poor reviews!  Check everything you order so you don't experience this bs!  Not worth even One star!"}
{"text":"I recently went on a Friday after work for dinner to bring home.  I ordered the 8-piece grilled with mashed potatoes and green beans.    I had not been to a Kentucky Fried Chicken for some time and this trip reminded me why I had stopped eating at this chain.  The chicken pieces were small with small bones.  The meat was dry.  The potatoes probably come out of a box and luckily there was enough gravy to make it palatable.  The green beans looked like they had come out of a can and had been cooked too long, so they were such a dark shade of green that I wasn't quite sure they were green (plus the container was loaded with water).  The biscuits were very dry but with some butter and nuked in the microwave they were edible.  

On the plus side, the people staffing the drive thru seemed nice and decent.  Unfortunately, after spending $20 to get dry \"food\",  the staff is not enough to bring me back to this restaurant.  This is a place to be skipped."}
{"text":"Just an awful restaurant. My order was incorrect and I was overcharged. So then after waiting forever in line I get to the window to find out I'm being charged for stuff I did not order! Geeze! It was so frustrating I had just gotten out if work and wanted to grab good and go home! So after trying to explain my order for the third time I was just fed up, so I told the guy that I didn't want anything that I would go somewhere else and proceeded to drive off. He sticks his head out of the window and yells \"NEXT TIME DONT SMOKE BEFORE YOU GO ORDER FOOD!\" Seriously the nerve! I had just worked a ten hour shift this guy was way out of line and highly unprofessional! Who hires these people!? I will never go back there, and with the service they provide I would not recommend anyone else to."}
{"text":"I witnessed this dumb red head cashier take the tongs used for outgoing food and pick up the person in front of me half eaten chicken he was complaining about then put them right back on the shelf to be used again. It was disgusting. Not to mention every time i come here I'm like waiting 30mins for two meals. They are always out of everything. Just disgusting garbage restaurant filthy, and slow retards working there. No wonder that guy below got food poisoning."}
{"text":"What a continued disappointment. I have yet to get an order from this place that was even close to correct. The chicken is almost always overcooked, or has very little meat on the bone. Management must feel that there are enough suckers around to keep their business going for ever, because they choose not to respond to complaints. I will never set foot in another KFC as long as I live."}
{"text":"Worst kfc I ever been too, way over price bad service. And chicken are not fresh also charge me $1 for hot sauce and ketchup which I only got a few. Don't waste your time save your trip and head to the next nearest kfc."}
{"text":"This has to be the dirtiest fastfood restaurant I have ever been to, and that says alot considering that we have numerous Filibertos and wannabe Fillies here. The dinning area was full of litter on the floor, chairs and tables along with food crumbs on nearly every table. I would have understood if it was busy but it was 8:30 in the evening and there was only one family of 5 in the lobby and nobody in the drive-thru when i arrived. the childish staff seemed more interested in playing around with each other and chatting with friends (which they gave free food to) and texting or browsing the Internet on their phones than doing their job. the food was less than apetizing. this is the first negative review i have ever given any company, but felt compelled to save the public time, money and health. I hadn't had anything to eat that day (12/12/15) so i was starving yet didnt have the stomach to finish my 2 piece meal and I CAN EAT LIKE A PIG!!!  a couple of the employees went outside to their cars and to chat with friends but upon returning failed to wash their hands. thats when i tossed the rest of my food disgusted and wondering if they did the same after using the restroom.  I hope the owner or manager reads this and takes action to hire some cleaner individuals that like to do their job well.  The only positive thing i have to say about this place is they at least still had extra crispy chicken. even when I arrived the kid at the counter was more interested in his phone then answering my questions like what is in the number 10 he said \"three pieces\". I said I can read I asked what is in the three piece. I hope you all avoid this place as I will in the future."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday and horrible service.  I ordered the family meal and the girl that helped us had no Idea what she is doing. Can't take an order correctly,  then she says I have to pay with my card because she can't accept cash. When we were waiting for our food they were literally standing there talking instead of getting our order ready.  They also forgot the cake they give u with the family meal. Do not go there unless u want rude and horrible service!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good here, but if you want long wait times and screwed up orders this is the place to go. I personally wasn't looking for long wait times or screwed up orders but I got one and so did the guy in front of me. I guess it's just how the cookie crumbles here."}
{"text":"They have horrible service! I waited 30 minutes in the drive thru for my order, and the time before that they had nothing ! I would give it zero stars"}
{"text":"How do I give negative stars?? The location is slow, always out of the basics like biscuits or chicken breasts and has iffy customer service.  Been here four times. Every time there are out of something I am trying to order.  I'm not going right before they close.  It's ridiculous.  I started laughing when I was told they had no chicken breasts. None.  And no biscuits.  Wth?"}
{"text":"This place gives dirty restaurants a bad name. The food was so so but fast.  The tables walls ceiling benches and floors were absolutely disgusting.  It needs to be hosed down with hand sanitizer."}
{"text":"Absolutely ridiculous that they don't have grilled and if they do it is limited. The person taking the order was rude and unprofessional."}
{"text":"Went here last night was told to pull to the front and they would bring out order to us. So waited for 15 min, which I was like ok getting fresh chicken or something. So the girl comes out and she gives us some of our food and tries to give some to a car parked next to us the rest of our food, thank God the lady was honest and told her that was not her food, and I asked what it was and it turned out to be the rest of our order. So we get home, fix our plates and we couldn't even chew the chicken the meat was extremely hard. Not expecting that for a $38 meal. Needless to say I will never go back to KFC at least not that one."}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru I got the wrong drink and all my sides were wrong unfortunately I was taking this to work so I couldn't go back and get it corrected. That was a waste of money"}
{"text":"I stopped in at 3pm because I hadn't had lunch yet and haven't had KFC (always delicious) in a while. Very quiet, only a few people in the dining room. Madison was wonderful taking the orders, excellent interaction with eye contact & a smile. I quickly had my tenders combo that was as delicious as I've had at any other KFC. I was excited to see Sobe Water in their fountain (full of flavor, zero calories, natural sweetener). I did shift to paying with cash instead of Google Wallet or card due to a small surcharge for debit card (not a big deal, but why spend extra when I have cash) and this location doesn't have a contactless payment system. Overall, I left happy and hunger satisfied."}
{"text":"This is the worse experience i ever had, I would never eat kfc again in my life, i ordered the 20 piece meal original chicken on yonge & steeles restaurant  all the chicken has a clear gel inside of it, i would recoment people not to go there"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service-even witnessed rudeness to a woman in a wheel chair. We ordered one thing-bucket of GRILLED chicken. They gave us fried.   Little wonder why Chick Fil A dominates.   AVOID"}
{"text":"The previous customer is right!! Something is wrong at this location all the time. They are either out of chicken, desserts, sides, etc all the time. The chicken is not always fresh and the drinks don't taste well.  As much as I love KFC, I would venture to say this location desperately needs management support."}
{"text":"Nothing is worth a one star but this place is pretty close. Terrible service they always mess up the order AND they are rude. One time i even got a piece of chicken that was solid rock hard like it was days old. I do not recommend this place. STAY AWAY!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why kfc has a hard time getting orders right. I gave them one more chance after the ladt 2 scew ups... i waited 15 mins for hot wings and then told I had to wait 10 more mins for hot wings..I just asked for my money back.
But it seems like all the kfc's have issues in customer ratings around here? I know it's not a high paying career but shouldn't it be expected to get what you ordered?"}
{"text":"Sorry guys your drive thru service sucks!!!  Can you guys read the order on the ticket because you guys pretty much also screw up my order??? Duh. I'm sure you guys are aware that your drive thru speaker is horrible with unclear and static noises but haven't changed it for a long time. Oh yeah FYI your phone number on your receipt and Yelp is incorrect and does not work. I wonder why?  Hmmmm. I guess it's now Popeyes chicken for me.  I managed for years the corporate restaurant for Carl's Jr and would have fired whoever is running this location. It all falls down to the manager. Deal with it!"}
{"text":"Do not go here. I live down the street and decided to stop in last night. It's been awhile since I've eaten here, and last night reminded me why. One word...filthy! Trash and dried up soda near the fountains. Not very good service either. Chicken was dry. I counted 4 people come in from the drive thru to complain about missing items. I had to wait just to place my order. The staff looked lost and I overheard (what I presume to be the Supervisor) yell at the staff to just give them what they want to make them happy. Yeah....not going here anymore."}
{"text":"Another raid trip, another KFC. I usually don't go into fast food places and on the account of the interior is not always up to par with what it would be. However yesterday I was delightfully surprised with a clean and tidy restaurant. The lady (Alison) was one of the friendliest people I had seen in a fast food place in a while. The food was fast and really good. And to top it off Alison was walking around asking how everybody's food was and checking on everything. Great food. Great service. 5/5"}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru tonight and didnt receive any of my sides.  Upon returning to the drive thru the girls told me they prolly did give them to me, but she would give me more anyway.  FIRST I ordered 17 dollars worth of food.  Why would I want to get some free mashed potatoes and cole slaw.  SECOND I made it all the way home and wasted my gas to get the order correct.  Way to call your customers liars.  Never going back again!"}
{"text":"horrible chic wings  as if they'd been under heat lamp. forever. hardly edible.  kfc windmill by eastern. tasted old. i was not a happy diner. i had had more time would have returned."}
{"text":"Literally waited 20 minutes for a chicken bowl and biscuits.  The employees didn't apologize for the wait at all. Every experience I have there has been horrible, worst KFC I have ever been to."}
{"text":"Just came here after being in line for 20 minutes I pay for my food and I ask if they have everything right they give my food I get back to the office only to find they gave me a pot pie and not my right order!! I call and they have a voicemail that is not set up now I'm late for lunch and have to go back to get a right order and waste gas I am beyond upset. All for a piece of chicken!!! Seriously can't believe they don't have a working phone!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, grilled chicken is not always fresh or in stock, but great quality food. The biggest problem with KFC is the prices. The freshest chicken always seems to be right when the store opens and between 5 to 6 pm."}
{"text":"This is a horrible location to get hot wings they cook them only as ordered so you're going to end up waiting 10 minutes"}
{"text":"Ive been to this location twice. Both times bad! This last visit..my son ordered the $5 fill up after his football game (he was hungry) ..got 1 drum stick and one small wing. Suppose to have 2 drumsticks in it...The phone number on receipt is 281-569-4640 and website here says 281-561-4640.. nobody answers.. and why is it a Texas phone number?? It is a business in Las VEGAS!! I used my debit card...they charged me a 39 Cent fee for it..and could have used it as charge for free... but they didn't ask me!
My fries were like HARD CRISPY STICKS!  Never Again!"}
{"text":"Worst KFC I've been to. The workers seemed pleasant but weren't very quick on helping customers. It was Filthy. They were out of Pepsi, biscuits, salt, fruit punch. The garbage was running over, trays were sticky, and the floors were disgusting! We had to get someone to clean a table so we could sit. Once we got out food and a place to sit, the food was decent. But then a giant bug landed on me!

Not going back."}
{"text":"I contacted KFC via their website and they happily rectified the situation 2 weeks after the initial problems"}
{"text":"This location was one of the best in terms of crispness and well coating chicken.  Over the past six years since moving to Markham this was to goto KFC!  Something new has changed since approimately June 2015- the chicken is not coated enough with seasoning, is soggy with oil (including fries). If this is a new franchise owner i suggest they go back for training as sales will slowly decline as more and more get dissappointed."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I have been to this location several times.  Never had a good experience. Something is either made incorrectly or i dont receive what i order. Never do i get a survey code on any receipt.  Iys been a few months so i gave them another try. 

I went to the drive thru. One of my items I ordered was a mini chicken quesadilla. Paid and got my food. I noticed I was charged for the regular quesadilla and also received the larger one. I was not told otherwise the mini is not on the menu at this location. While I paid, watched the cashier grab the receipt, tear off the bottom portion, then put the remainder of the receipt in the bag. I've done some research and all the survey codes on this type of receipt are on the last bottom section, which was torn off. So upon the cashier doing that, I cannot take the survey the restuarant provides. How many other surveys do they tear off? Does the manager keep them and use them to get a bonus? I don't know."}
{"text":"Crappy service. 
The workers there seem to hate their job so they take it out on customers haha.
Food was pretty cold when I got it.
Biscuits were probably old as sh*t.
Waste of space on Rainbow Blvd to be honest. 
Should have built a greens and proteins there instead ."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review while I'm sitting in the drive thru for half an hour for a beef burrito."}
{"text":"Pretty dirty and grimey. Afraid to touch anything. Getting food to go at 830pm. Just not clean at all."}
{"text":"Avoid KFC at all costs! The food quality is continuously horrible. My food had mold on it. When I called and asked to speak to a manager no one spoke English. Never again."}
{"text":"this location is the worst restaurant in phoenix. poor management. food was cold. tables and floor were dirty. stinky. and sticky. every time i give this place a chance, every time i get disappointed and disgusted i will never come back to this place. they need to get rid of that thing they call a manager."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from this location on many occasions.... As always the fries r soggy, the chicken was greasy, the gravy cold and lumpy... They always talk how fresh their chicken is... Btw, I love chicken!  Favourite meat.. I won't be ordering from KFC again."}
{"text":"Two cases of food poisoning in two days!  One was my 5 yr old nephew that ate a chicken little. He was sick for a day and a half. 
Then a friend of mine had a chicken sandwich yesterday that ended up with a hospital visit this morning. Hopefully he will be released by the end of the day."}
{"text":"Prepare for a 30 to 40 min wait and no way to get out of line because your blocked in! Worst EVER!"}
{"text":"Ok, I have to say this right now; Otherwise, I would go to bed feeling angry and my boyfriend would suffer and that is not fair :(

This KFC is very inconsistent in their food and I always come back hoping for a miracle, I don't know, my love for fried chicken makes me blind I guess; However, today I had the worst chicken tenders I have ever eaten here, they were so chewy I could not eat them. I have had the same exact chicken tender many times and they are nice and extra crispy, today they were cooked to death and there wasn't any crispiness whatsoever. Besides, the staff at this location do not care about what their customers, sometimes I stand up at the counter and I wait at least 2-3 minutes until somebody has the decency to notice I am there. Once they take your order they seem to be annoyed by you, like if you are on their way. I am very dissapointed."}
{"text":"Visited this store on 6/8/17 and ordered a chicken breast basket. When I got home I acted the side orders and saved what I thought would be the best part of the meal. My first bite of the breast was ok but as I continued I bit into something black and upon looking further it appeared to be like a chicken toe nail and no part of a breast! There were two of these \"black toe nail bones\" in the breast piece. So disgusting! I drove back to the store and the assistant mgr. asked if I wanted another breast-are you kidding me? I wanted my money back and he checked with the mgr. and said they have to deduct for the sides. Yes I ate them but I also had to leave my home and drive back with the breast. They did not care. Mgr. should have come out to talk to me. I took pictures of what the chicken breast looked like but do not know how to post them on Yelp. They never explained what the black bone pieces may have been. Disgusting food and customer service!"}
{"text":"Went there today just before 5pm. Took the lady at the register at least 6-8 minutes to take our order. She was too busy getting other peoples orders together to ring anyone up. Finally we get to order. I try to order a pot pie combo, but she runs to the back, then continues to tell me I will have to wait 20 minutes if I wanted a pot pie! My bad I thought I was at a FAST food restaurant.  So I had to order something I didn't even really want. I ordered 1 large drink & 1 medium drink, but got 2 medium cups handed to me. My girlfreind ordered chicken strips and potato wedges w/ranch sauce. In the box she was given mashed potatoes & no ranch sauce. She tried to bring the incorrect order to the counter with the receipt which showed what she gave was wrong & waited for another 4-5 minutes just to get her order fixed. My food was cold by then. As we finally were able to eat, we had a comedy show watching every other person who came in after us all having the same type issues. It wansn't really even busy at all. BEWARE of this location.... Try the In & Out Burger next door. Even though we might have gotten poisoned, we would have had better luck at the Chipotle next door."}
{"text":"For those of you pining for the threat of violence with your disposable lunch, this is the location for you! Situated in the heart of the burgeoning Fashion District, but still retaining some of Queen West's \"olde-timey\" local colour, this KFC/Taco Bell location at first beguiles with its anachronistic, chalet-facade (surprisingly unmarked by graffiti) and array of inexpensive offerings.  However, less than two minutes into my repast (I sat at the less-dirty of the two window tables, hoping for a quick exit), a lumbering street local bounded into the store, only to be taunted by a cohort outside.  Some pounding on the window ensued, and the lumbering one headed for the exit, frightening a woman and her toddler presumably waiting for the washroom to be vacated.  He turned at the fire exit, headed back towards me, only to be blocked by the man from outside. Swearing and pushing erupted, the smaller man landing in the chair opposite me. The larger man then returned to the fire exit, further terrifying the (still waiting) mother and child, and exited onto Augusta, triggering the alarm.  The thing is, the staff took a good LONG time to investigate--presumably, the whine of the claxon is a recurring element of their work day?  As for the food?  It was my first Taco Bell combo in more than a decade--and it utterly failed to deliver the forbidden tang I would expect from Yum! Brands. Didn't I read somewhere that Gidget the Chihuahua died of a stroke?"}
{"text":"Worst KFC service ever.  I was in the drive thru and ordered a single $5 meal.  After driving up to the window I sat UNATTENDED for 10 MINUTES.  That's an eternity at a drive through window.  No one even opened the window to engage me whatsoever.  No explanation about the delay, no estimated wait time, no apology, no communication at all.  After 10 minutes, I laid on the horn, flipped the empty window the bird and drove off.

This KFC has an excellent location and should be rolling in customers (and cash), but I consistently find it barren of customers.  Every review here on Yelp is 100% accurate as I have experienced every situation described.  I am boycotting this location until someone steps in takes charge.  Fast food restaurant management and daily food service is certainly not cutting edge as successful franchises have been operating for decades.  What is the problem here!!??"}
{"text":"Not interested in lids? This KFC is for you. Don't want a knife? This KFC is for you. Can do without butter? This KFC is for you. Prefer to wait 10 minutes to have your order taken while the help talks about their hangovers? Want to wait 15 min. more for your food, and then not get what you ordered? This KFC is PERFECT!!! 
If this were the first time I would give this place a pass before I posted a review, but this KFC has failed previously. Hence my wrath."}
{"text":"Don't bother.. went there last night for dinner and they were out of boneless anything and said it would 20 min, out of just original recipe with the same 20 min wait..when we settle to the crispy with bones we pulled up to the window and discovered two other cars in front of us appearing to be waiting the 20 min for their food. We also could see all of the cooks standing out back smoking while everyone was waiting. The window clerk didnt even come to the window for a good 10 min to even simple say hello and be courteous. When she did come to the window, I said\" we're actually going to leave now... the wait time and things you are out of is rediculous\" she said ok and shut the window..no i apologize or sorries at this place...we drove to the KFC up on Gilbert & chandler blvd..much Better service! they had food and a smile to go with it. Dont know what happened to this KFC.. wont ever go back."}
{"text":"I had a craving for fried chicken so thought the Tuesday special was a good fit.  It was noon time so we had in mind fresh, newly fried chicken but were disappointed that the chicken tasted and looked like it had been sitting for quite awhile.  The ice machine was out of ice.  Worst was the ladies bathroom... no toilet tissue with no alternatives such as paper towels (they have the hand driers) and no toilet paper covers.  Based on previous reviews, this is not unusual for this location.  Instead of spending money on advertising, it would be better spent on staffing and proper training.  I am assuming Corporate does quality checks on all their locations to ensure the quality of the brand but maybe not.  I will never go to this location again."}
{"text":"Chicken not edible no sauces, butter, or honey offered. Took one bite and threw the whole meal away. Biggest waste of $9.76"}
{"text":"It's just after 8pm, there was a line in the drive thru so we went inside to order instead... Bad move!!! Hella cars got through, even orders after mine, and I'm still waiting on my order. It's not even a big order. Myself and everyone else in here that came after me and most cars that are gone by now shouldn't have to be bumped just so they can clear their drive thru orders."}
{"text":"I was in the area and i was hungry so i ordered poutine and 2 piece chicken. the poutine had barely any gravy or cheese and the chicken wasn't cooked this was my 3rd time getting this kind of service at this kfc. the employees here are also rude, if you want kfc i suggest taking the extra trip by going to a different location you won't regret it"}
{"text":"One should never expect much from fast food, and I don't. Is it really common practice to not have what you sell available? There really aren't many fast food choices in this area - or I wouldn't have subjected myself to the standard 20 minute wait time again.  I'm sitting in the lot waiting it out for the Colonel. You know what really grinds my gears? This specific KFC.  The worst. Ever. Unreal.

Ok I feel like the kind gesture from the team made it right.  There's that :)"}
{"text":"I can't believe the experience we had here! We asked the young man at the counter about the picture that was posted. I wanted to know if everything shown in the picture was part of the meal. His response was that it would be a waste of space on the picture if it was not. OK, we let that slide. After placing our order we were told that the debit machine was down and showed us that the keys did not work with very exaggerated movements. I told him he was very rude and should brush up on his customer service skills.  After visiting the bank next door to get cash, (and paying a $3.00 service charge to withdraw the money) we returned and decided to speak with the manager. Guess what?? Debit worked at the adjoining cash register!! The young man was just not willing to let us know that!  The manager apologized and gave us a cake, but I am not impressed that such a rude young person was allowed to serve (and I use that word very loosely) customers and represent the company at the counter. We were pleased with the food, but let's face it, there are other KFC's to go to."}
{"text":"Pretty sure I'm not invisible, but appear to be to the Friday night crew at this particular KFC. Stood there for what seemed to be an eternity, then left to go to Popeyes. 

Should have known better, this location is just aweful. Should rename themselves KFuC."}
{"text":"Disregard previous 5 star review from one year ago....this place has gone downhill. Dirty."}
{"text":"Window worker very friendly but was asked to pull forward to wait for my order.  I had only ordered 4 chicken littles.   Window person said that they have a time limit on window time.  I could understand this if it was busy but I was the ONLY car there!  Apparently the manager AND district manager get on them if they go over the time limit.  So much for personal service - all KFC cares about is the bottom dollar!!  I feel sorry for employees as they are paid crap wages to have to put up with managerial BS!!"}
{"text":"This has got to be the dirtiest place I have ever eaten at. There wasn't a single clean table and your shoes stick to the floor as you walk. On the couple of occasions I have come here my order is usually wrong. Guess it's to hard to read a screen and place food in a bag."}
{"text":"chicken has no flavor and sweet tea smh horrible not sweet at all taste like rust water never again will I come here"}
{"text":"website says that hours are SEASONAL and to call store for hours . it is 630pm and phone has been busy since 6pm.  Didn't want leftover chicken especially served with attitude! ! !
I guess I should take the old TV ad's advice. .BEEF, IT'S WHAT'S FOR DINNER!!!"}
{"text":"You'd think a popular restaurant that exclusively sells chicken would always have it available, so being told I'd have to wait 15-20 minutes until they cooked it was crazy - maybe that's just the way they roll in Vegas !"}
{"text":"Don't stop there it's the worst KFC as far service and food.   Do yourself a favor a drive to the 67th Ave KFC or Taco Bell.   At least you will feel good about not making a bad decision."}
{"text":"If I could give no star I would! This KFC is horrible. They always change management. I went today ask for 8pc grilled and told me the wait would be 10mins. I WAITED 20mins!! Hispanic leader came out and offered more chicken in crispy because there were no more breast in grilled. Even gave me an extra side. He was very nice! However got home and their were no Grilled pieces of chicken at all!!! THE ONLY REASON I WAITED!!! What a waste of my time and money!!!! Dumb workers!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service is terrible. Stood at a register in a empty restaurant for 10 minutes & the workers looked at me but never acknowledged my presence. Finally ordered & waited for another 15 minutes for a couple tacos. I'll NEVER return."}
{"text":"Chiude troppo presto, le commesse fanno molta confusione con le ordinazioni. Kfc ha perso parte dello smalto che aveva nei tempi passati."}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly. Food quality is good and value for money is good as well. Cleanliness is an issue across the place especially restrooms."}
{"text":"Second and likely final visit to this location.  Stopped in last night around 7:30.  There was one couple already seated and eating inside the restaurant, nobody else.  The drive-thru must have been hopping, because it was like the sky was falling behind the counter.  The \"lady\" that \"helped\" us (very loose terms there) - I wish I had gotten her name - clearly lost any personality that she may have had, YEARS ago.  She was like a robot taking our orders, and I wasn't even sure we would get all the way through the order.  I asked if she could make change for a hundy, and without missing a beat, she just points to the bottom front of the register to the sign that says \"No bills larger than $20.\"  Didn't even say a word. I asked, \"I take that as a 'no'?\"  Not even a response.  Whatever.  I paid with a credit card instead (had no other cash).  I said \"thank you\" and she simply turned away to put our order together.  

We sat down and enjoyed watching the chaos from the dining room.  As we waited for our food, a few other customers came in, and their order experience was much the same.  There was one person waiting to order, and when she finally got around to taking his order (he was there for a couple minutes with nary a word from anyone behind the counter) she exclaimed, \"I can help the next customer!\"  Wow, what personal service.  I kept reminding myself that it's ONLY KFC, this is what crummy fast food is like I guess.  We saw several other customers order while we waited, and with every \"thank you\" a customer would say, she did not even acknowledge it.  Outdated fast food chain or not, that's just a lack of decency and manners right there. 

Our food finally came 13 minutes after we ordered (ages in fast food) even though half of it was sitting on the prep line since right after we ordered.  There seemed to be some question as to who was going to put our order together (had to make the chicken littles).  When we brought it back to the table, the 1pc grilled breast meal (note \"1pc\") was a joke, it just had to be!  It was the smallest, most nastiest looking excuse for a chicken breast either of us had seen.  We drew straws for who would go talk to the lifeless order-taker and ask for a chicken breast that might be more suitable for a 1pc meal - you know, something slightly larger than a chicken wing.  

This place was a joke both times we've been there...  Service was unacceptable, and food mediocre.  Quite the disappointment from the KFC I remember enjoying in the past.  I gave this one a 2 star over 1, since she did at least try to hunt around for a larger breast piece when I rejected the first, and surprisingly, offered me a water cup without me having to ask, since I did not order a drink.  

Definitely won't be back, at least not to this location."}
{"text":"Every once in a while I stop for fast food and today was a day I didn't feel like making food or having my hubby make food.
I stopped at this KFC to make my life easy this evening and I didn't see the line wrapped around the corner until I was in line and someone behind me (couldn't get out of line).
It took about 10-15 min to get to the speaker. The guy on the speaker was very friendly. Took about 20 min. for me to decide AFTER the guy took my order that I no longer wanted to wait. My 3 year old had to use the restroom and ended up going in his pants. Finally, I had an opportunity to get out of line, so I left.
I think 35 min of waiting in line and not even receiving my order is not convenient. I like it fresh, but dang isn't it supposed to be fast food?"}
{"text":"Terribly greasy chicken. No m.potatoes. Three coleslaw in my bag. And the gravy was as thin as tea. 
15$ for what?"}
{"text":"I don't think anybody who works for this company knowns English. Maybe it's just the restaurants around here."}
{"text":"This place CANNOT EVER give me everything I order. They are the most worthless, slack jawed, habitual screw up's I have ever witnessed. Not only do they always forget something, but half the menu will take \"another 16 minutes\" according to the drive up attendant. Dont ever stop here!!!!!You will regret it!!!!Check your order before you pull away at least!!!"}
{"text":"This is a fairly unorganized establishment I wasn't expecting a lot from KFC and I was very let down. We waited 30 minutes to get our food and people behind us got their food first. I'm not a Christian but I pray that god kills each one of them. I hope their first born die of a painful death and I hope that one day they learn what true pain is. I hope aids spreads across the valley. If not for the laws of this land I would have them stoned myself. May a thousand curses be put upon this establishment Good chicken though  

Xoxo 
Disappointed but full Gossip girl"}
{"text":"Prior to tonight, the last time I ate at a KFC was 5 years ago at the Barberton location before it closed down.  I thought there was no way it could be as bad as it was then, where they had only two people working and it took 15 minutes to get our food.  Well, this experience was pretty darn close.  First off, the smell from the bathrooms near the front counter was absolutely nauseating.  Pretty sure they hadn't cleaned in there for a few days.  Next, it took 5 minutes of us waiting before they told us they were out of mac n' cheese.  While waiting, we also noticed multiple pieces of dropped food clearly visible on the kitchen floor.  I thought the quality of the food was okay, while my fiance said his original recipe was greasy.  While we were eating, we heard someone in line being told that they were out of dark meat, and that it would be at least a half an hour before they had any.  Seriously?  It wasn't like it was the end of the night...it was 7:30.   Needless to say, it will probably be another 5 years before I visit a KFC."}
{"text":"Would give it a zero if I could, waited over 20 min for my order with no one in front of me.  I ordered 6 piece crispy chicken and 9 piece tenders.  I was also very disappointed at how dirty the kitchen and the bathrooms were.

 In kitchen food all other the floor and counters. Cook throwing chicken in deep fryer from 10 feet, very disorganized and disoriented staff.  

Worst KFC franchise I have ever seen, by far.  Oh man this place needs help."}
{"text":"If I was an out of towner and was looking for KFC, first thing id notice is that this location is a dump.  The property is in rough shape.  Seem to be nice people, but they are slow because they are always understaffed.  The cleanliness inside depends on how well they're staffed.  The food is hit or miss on freshness.  What prompted this review?  My last visit.  Conversation with employee:

Emp: Is no ice in your drink ok?
Me: You guys don't have any ice?
Emp: Well, we do, but it's dirty.
Me: No ice."}
{"text":"I went to this KFC the other day and it was pretty dirty inside. I know fast food typically isn't the cleanest but this was dirty to another level. Fries and chicken pieces all over the floor, grease streaks, and sticky pop spilled near the pop fountains. Not 1 single clean table to dine at either. I would avoid this location. Used to be one of the better ones in the city, but I am talking ages ago."}
{"text":"Old chicken and is not up to standards of the Dutch KFC! Will certainly not come again"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I love KFC chicken and I actually get pretty good service at this location. The people there are very polite and nice... But that's where the good in this review ends. I can't seem to get a good meal when I frequent this place which isn't very often as a result. They never have pot pies ready during peak hours and claim a 20 minute wait and the chicken tastes like it's been sitting under warming lights for over an hour (extremely dried out). My most frequent visit involved me visiting the drive thru and asking for a pot pie at 6pm. I was told they had none and it would be a twenty minute wait. I instead opted for a 4 piece meal with extra crispy chicken. When I got home and opened the box I noticed I was given 1 leg and three wings and was pretty pissed off. Not wanting to drive back to remedy the problem I chose to eat my chicken in a foul mood... Of course it was dried out and tasted like it was cooked yesterday. I tried to call three times but it just rings and rings and then hangs up on you. Next time I will just go to Popeyes which is 10 minutes further but their chicken is better anyways!"}
{"text":"Price jump for what! $10 bucket turned into $16.98 
1/2 gallon lemonade $5.98 yea right!"}
{"text":"i recommend drinking the gravy, best soup on the menu!!



got diarrhea after tho :("}
{"text":"Way overpriced, since when did a tiny piece of chicken become $5. I can buy a 3 pound bag at walmart for that. Anyway, I went around 10pm and ordered a famous bowl and it was less than half full! Bull crap, this KFC reallly lacks."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. My husband just came back from this KFC, it's 9:45pm (they close at 10) on a Sunday night. When he pulled up to the drive-thru he was told he couldn't order because \"they didn't have anything anymore\" Really?? They were obviously just lazy kids who didn't want to make anything else for the night. Won't be back."}
{"text":"First time going to this KFC and the Kitchen was  atrocious, had a bucket of chicken and a tortilla laying on the floor. It is a filthy establishment, with obvious health and safety code violations. I would never eat there again after this visit. I'm sorry for KFC to have these kind of workers to represent their name."}
{"text":"Went to KFC on 39th Avenue and Pinnacle Peak for dinner took a takeout on the advertised bucket with two sides I was under the impression you were supposed to get two sides twice but that's okay but the chicken was horrible it was very dry like it's been under a lamp for hours and hours and hours I don't think I'll recommend or either KFC again for a while until they can figure out a way to make their chicken more moist"}
{"text":"Probably the worst KFC ever. Every time I pick up a fries it's cold, not even tad warm. When I tell them to make fresh one they act like they have seen a ghost or something. Today I ordered Zinger sandwich and it looked like they pre heated the same meat again it tasted horrible. I asked her to redo both fries and sandwich.  Sandwich was fresh but chicken was still raw and fries was still cold when I got home. I live about 3 min drive from there.  Anyways never going back again.  This place needs to shut down."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time I've been to this location because it's so close to our house. 

Customer service ALWAYS sucks. I went through the drive through once. Sat for 15 minutes. Then left. Then this time they literally forgot half of my order. How do you not remember to put half the order in the bag? 

And they charge that .39 for debit cards. I told her to run it as credit. She didn't. And I got charged. It's not about the .39 it's the fact that they don't listen. At all. 

I'd rather drive to another location even though it's farther at least they get my order right. 

They haven't been open long but they definitely need new management ASAP."}
{"text":"It is still a horrible place to go to. No one acknowledged us for more than 15 mins and found out that they were out of what we wanted."}
{"text":"I had to give it a star to do the review, do not go here the food is so far below substandard and even though we received an offer to replace the bad food they suddenly lost the books these offers are logged in.  What a joke of a KFC no one cares and they treat the customers lousy."}
{"text":"Standard KFC fare. Establishment was very clean, the staff was prompt and nice. No welcome however, and was not spoken to, even when awaiting help, until approaching the register. Food was good, although the portions seemed to have gotten smaller over the years."}
{"text":"Do not go to this KFC. I do not know why they can't  switch out mash potatoes for potatoe wedges. The one on 40th st. And Thomas can. Only to be told here \"some can and some can't. We are the one that won't \"
Since churches is much closer to my home anyway, I'm sure they will like my business."}
{"text":"Live close by so have tried several times. Order is usually wrong so make sure you check it before you leave. Quality is 50/50 and owner lives in Phoenix. Complaining is pointless. If you have a choice just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I ordered a side of sweet corn and a chicken bowl. When I got home I realized the corn they gave me was completely dried up. I took it back and they stated that they ran out of corn and I got the last of it. I guess they don't issue refunds either"}
{"text":"Stopped by this location to grab a quick lunch in the drive thru. I ordered the hot wings combo. Got home to find most of the chicken was still raw!! Disgusting."}
{"text":"So I have to wait because your potato wedges aren't done, but I have already told you there isn't any toilet paper in the bathroom. Not like I can improvise because there is an air dryer and not one lick of fucking paper in the bathroom... This place sucks. I am sure it's a health violation that there is no paper for use in the bathrooms.. That's my next stop. Corporate!"}
{"text":"This is the most ghetto KFC I've been to and that includes ones in the States where they offer buffets. You can understand the riff-raff coming out for that, but why is this KFC full of sick looking people and scum bags? I guess it's the location down on 17th. The place will make money, the owner thinks, so why bother trying to clean it up.
We went in for lunch one afternoon. The kid taking the order didn't understand a word we were saying and nobody else there seemed too concerned. When I went to open the bathroom door, it was locked. I had to ask politely to obtain a key to this first-class toilet. I knew it was first-class because the key came attached to the top of a plastic garbage pail. You'd think if they kept the toilet under lock and key, it would remain relatively clean. This was not the case. It was like the crackheads had taken turns cleaning their genitals in there with wet toilet paper, finally defecating all over the toilet to express their satisfaction with the facilities.
The food wasn't much better. The chicken was tiny and over-cooked and the big crunch sandwich had shriveled up while waiting for me.
Try to avoid this place and look elsewhere for your KFC fix...."}
{"text":"Need improvement..
Won't tell you some items they are out of stock..

Have to ask for condiments...
Slow service...

The wait is forever, their always out of what I order and the chicken has sat for so long that the grease has soaked all through and there's never a busy rush."}
{"text":"Coming from a long drive from Cali and checking in South Point hotel, decided to skip casino food. Headed to KFC, fairy new which was a good sign. Wow was I wrong, the cashier was new and did everything wrong. The person who was supposed to help was to busy doing ofher things. After a good ten miserable minutes the order was complete but receipt printer was suddenly down. After getting the order the cake that was supposed to come with order was not with the order. I ordered one cup for water for my daughter and they told me there are out (after I paid for four cups for sodas), I still insisted on a cup, then they offered one but $.69, after paying almost $50.00. I don't know but that particular location their management really suck balls big time. If all these negative reviews keeps climbing up hill that place will surely cease to exist because everyone pays attention and my behalf I went there because its fairy new"}
{"text":"The food is good if you get it during the busy parts of the day but watch out for later in the day the chicken can be dried up and they still serve it. I also have to empty my bag before leaving if getting it to go since they tend to usually short me something in my order but never had them give any extra in it."}
{"text":"Alway out of something and what moles it worse is the charge 39cents more to use my. Debit card , this place need to get with it ."}
{"text":"Not really a fan of KFC. Usually I find it greasy and overpriced. However this version of the restaurant (select/fresh) is a huge improvement. The menu is more creative, the atmosphere updated, and I didn't feel ripped off or greasy as I left. The computerized soda mixer was great (cherry mountain dew), spicy chicken sandwich and lattice cut fries were tasty. Beer for sale as well. As I left I felt that I would return here. Way better than say Tim Horton's or McDonalds. Hope more pop up across the city."}
{"text":"I will not be going to this KFC ever again.  I am just tired of awful food at these chains.    There was very little meat and what there was was slimy and undercooked.  I ordered original recipe.  Didn't expect much, but did expect for it to be edible."}
{"text":"Disgusting!!  Long wait, dirty drive through window. The worker opened the window covered in a dust like powder with dirty hands. We didn't even get our food we were so disgusted. Don't eat here ever!!  Manager must not care how his place is managed. Gross!!!"}
{"text":"First of all I want to say how the manager MAYRA is a little bitch she's a fucking rude ass \"manager\" they gave me some dried ass chicken with some cold ass mash potatoes!!! And hard ass rock chocolate chip cookies i ordered ! And this bitch ass hoe Mayra was been rude to me because I wanted my refund ! Wtf is wrong with her dark ugly monkey looking bitch ass !!!

This place is infested and dirty along with the workers !!!! It neeeedddssss to be closed down I'm tired of this god deam KFC shit ! Ain't ever going back there !"}
{"text":"After several visits to this location I feel compelled to pointing  out several systemic issues that are unique to this location & one that is more global. 

1.Customer service is very poor.  My observation is that more training is needed.    
2.  Each time they  appeared to be understaffed which contributed to the strained nature of how they interacted with customers.  The potato wedges were stale & obviously been sitting out too long.  This was at 6pm which would be during a dining time frame.  The order was  also not correct each time.
 
The menu as displayed is not easy to quickly read & the person takeing the order did not try to assist in making a decision..  Just stared at me.  I find it strange the package menu that offers a 3 piece box & soda is cheaper than just the box,  but that was what I was told as I did not want the sodas.

Not all KFCs are this way.   We stopped at one in Kona  Hawaii.  The service was excellent.   We arrived close to closing time, but did not feel rushed & the food was fresh."}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst KFC and Taco Bell I have ever been to.  Unfortunately it is the closest to my house and I have been here around 5 times.  The wait for the drive thru is horrific, up to 15 minutes most times.  Today it was over 20.  The tacos and burritos are never fresh and the Service is way below standards.  I now will I only go here for KFC.  I really hope management makes some serious changes to the food quality and trains their staff better."}
{"text":"I don't know why everyone rates this place low. It's a fast food joint with a bunch of teenagers workin. Of course they dont care. It's a bunch of underpaid people working very hard all day. I went threw drive threw and the girl sounded pretty tired. Probably because she's gets paid min wage I'm guessing. It's all good though I got food and it was fine. People are stupid. Just cook your own food if your gonna complain."}
{"text":"Worst KFC in America. Sat for 11mins in drive-thru without being greeted via the intercom. Cars had me boxed in or I would have either backed out like many did or had I been the first at the window I would have drove out! The order was incorrect, no biscuits in my 8pc meal. Calling the phone number - no answer. There was no utensils to eat cole slaw and mashed potatoes. The chicken was \"nasty\" - had a funky taste, more greasy than other KFC's. I am staying in a motel 2 miles away and would had driven it back for a refund if I wasn't feeling punky. This KFC has turned me off the product forever. It gets NO stars from me. Customer service and good food definitely lacking. Don't waste your time nor money."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch today.  The place is dirty.  One of the employees sneezed really loud into his hand and kept on going.  My friend told the lady at the register he sneezed in his hands and she said, \"it's okay he doesn't handle the food.\"  No one knows what goes on behind the scenes at fast food, but to see it was really gross.  We left."}
{"text":"The soda/ice machine is absolutely the most disgusting thing I have seen in a long time. This has to be a health code violation. If you're looking to get sick, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Wow!!! This place is horrible the drive thur the only thing open and we waited in line for over 45mins while the employees were in and out of the building... When it was my turn they told me they did not have any chicken and we would have to wait 20 mins for chicken.. We decided just to go with tacos and burritos and that was a mess.. Never again.."}
{"text":"The foods are okay but the staff are friendly in your face but secretly giving Sign to other customers to look  at your face all the way down to your between-legs."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely terrible, we have never been inside but we always come here when we are on our way to the drink in move theater down the street. Every single time whether we left the house late or early we almost miss the movie because we spend 30-40 minutes sitting in this drive-thru without our food. We left the house an hour before the movie start time and have sitting in the drive through for 40 minutes now......this place is very slow, we will no longer come to this location......serious waste of time."}
{"text":"I love KFC but like someone mention it sinks as soon as you park I front of this location. It kinda kills your appetite. And to top it off I feel like they lack in customers service. They don't greet you when you come in to let you know they at least know you standing there waiting while they are I. The back or the drive through. The chicken is good. And they do keep the tables clear if trash. They just need to work on customer service a little harder."}
{"text":"In the past I have been very disappointed in KFC. I found their chicken to be very greasy. We bought a bucket and there was a quarter inch of grease on the bottom of the bucket. This was at the KFC on boulder and Lake Mead in Henderson. They did the world a favor by closing that dump. One night my wife said that she was in the mood for chicken so against my better judgement I drove over to the KFC on Horizon. She wanted the two piece deal and after reading the menu I decided on the Pot Pie. Well we couldn't have been happier. The chicken was perfect and I loved the Pot Pie. Have been there three times now and I can't find one thing to complain about."}
{"text":"Avoid this store at all cost. Seriously, if you are dying of a horrible disease and the only known cure is eleven herbs and spices, *GO TO ANOTHER KFC*"}
{"text":"Cashier left front unattended until another employee collected them from the back to take our order and the few other people behind us. Ours and another order were forgotten about and we had to bring our receipts back up to the cashier so they could fulfill our orders while orders taken after ours were fulfilled. Trash all over the floors. Bathroom door and stall door were both sticky - gross! The only paper towel roll available was squashed on the floor. Not exactly what we want to dry our hands with."}
{"text":"Firstly, I have to say that I haven't had  KFC in years and had a hankering for it. We walked in and no one else was in line so should be fast service Right? Wrong. We waited 7 min for the cashier to finally mosey on up and take our order. Waited an additional 15 minutes for our food to come. My husband got the sweet tea, however it was sweet at all which we should've realized immediately since there was a tub of sugar packets right next to it. The food was disgusting and I hardly touched a thing. The manager on duty was also yelling at her staff. Won't be returning... Like ever."}
{"text":"I love fried chicken. They sell fried chicken. I love them. The End

Bonus points for having a drive thru and the recent renovations that gave them quite a facelift.

Less one star for having no biscuits! That's a KFC Canada problem apparently and I'm debating stating a petition for this. How am I supposed to eat fried chicken with no biscuits?

Edited
I had to change the rating of this business based on the inefficiency of their drive-thru. 50% of the time, I either get the wrong order given to me or items missing from my order. I've occasionally driven past other KFCs to come to this location because of the drive-thru. Getting home, opening the box and finding the wrong order pisses me off to no end."}
{"text":"Drove thru this place and ordered a meal when we got home all the sides were missing. I called them and drove all the way back to get them. I picked them up and they were the smallest sides I had ever seen. When I got home we opened up the chicken and there was a long piece of hair in it. I'm not one to be picky but come on."}
{"text":"Rarely do I receive what I consider 'fresh' food but that is not my complaint.  I was charged one fee (I have receipt) at drive through window.  Checking my bank entries the next day, this KFC charged my account twice, neither charge equaling the sales 'cash sale' ticket I received.  When I called to talk to the 'Manager' sic he proceeded to tell me there was a 39 cent charge because I used my debit card . .  mind you, none of the totals of the charges calculate to the sales total pus 39 cents.  Furthermore, I was never given the option to use the 'charge' portion of my Visa/Debit.  The 'manager' was rude, insulting, ignorant and much more, none of which is complimentary.  I am attempting to locate Corporate to report this - - - while less than a dollar involved, if this 'scam' is used on many folks driving through it is quite a nice little unearned, illegal profit.   They've seen the last of me - obviously!"}
{"text":"This place is a KFC and Taco Bell and it is terrible. The food tastes great but the service is not so great. Every time I've been here it takes 30 mins minimum to go through the drive thru to get my food whether there are two cars in front of you or 4. I don't know why it takes so long and I refuse to go back because it's so frustrating! And they don't always get the order right yet still take forever getting me the wrong order. Frustrating!"}
{"text":"Worst place ever. There is an staff of. #4. ONE for the drive thru and ONE for the front and TWO on the back one is possibly new and learning. The waiting could not be explained.  professionalism. The entire staff needs to be let go. A dine in client was waiting, no sure how long. One lady who placed and order had been waiting 15 minutes for food and a lady with her child had not even been acknowledged at the register, but 3 of the 4 staff members were just in the back. I wish I gad taken a video, Just a total disregard fir the customer. If I could rate with a minus 1 star I would"}
{"text":"We used to order from KFC all the time but on many occasions, we were either shorted chicken or sides.  Recently went back today after a 6 mos hiatus and again, we were shorted sides.  the chicken tenders on one order was nothing more than hardened batter with no chicken really to speak of.  We returned back to the restaurant to complain and were greeted with hostile employees - were not given the missing sides and insisted on getting a refund on the \"chicken tenders\" that I would not serve my dog.   Bottom line - would never recommend this location. Until they can actually get good help, chick filet looks to be the restaurant of choice."}
{"text":"Let me tell you about how angry & disgusted I was about my last order & experience here!!! I went straight to their Corporate Website & said every single grievance I had about this KFC location...MULTIPLE TIMES! And sent a \"strongly worded\" & lengthy email to boot!!! (WITH PICTURES!!! \"Visuals\" work wonders! Lol!) Yeah...I know it's a \"Franchise\" & privately run, but there has to be SOME accountability!!!
Well, surprise, surprise, SURPRISE!!! Someone called me back from Corporate!!! Recorded the call, even! Lol! No matter what he offered, you bet your life I'll NEVER patronize this place EVER AGAIN!!!

WHY? Because this was NOT the 1st time they over-charged me, got my order completely WRONG, where I had to turn around in my car & come allll the way back to get my \"correct\" food order so I could feed my entire, hungry family - but the Manager on duty was just AWFUL!!! Rude to the customers & yelling at an employee, who was obviously new !!! Nope...I will NOT spend another penny here...you shouldn't either!!!

(And about my pics...I should have spent my $50.00 somewhere else! HECK...ANYWHERE ELSE!!! And don't tell me I should have ck'd my order(s) before leaving! When there's 6 pissed-off custs/cars behind you, it's kinda hard to go thru every single item to make sure someone was just \"doing their job\" correctly!! It should be the LEAST I should EXPECT!!!)"}
{"text":"EXTREMELY BAD SERVICE! I ordered online and made a call at 40 minutes because the food is supposed to be here. A lady picked up and said the delivery guy is on his way. Waited another 30 mins and the food is still not here. I had to cancel the order with disappointment and the lady was very rude. No apology and just hung up the phone. Don't eat here"}
{"text":"I was sitting in the drive thru when they turned the menu lights off on me. I looked at the time and it was 9:44pm The other day I came inside and ordered 2 flat bread sandwiches and it took 13 mins to get the food out. They didnt even apologise for the long wait. They weren't even busy. Idk what's going on with this store lately but it seems like the crew needs more customer service training. Won't be coming back to this location anymore!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE DRIVE THRU EXPERIENCE!!!! I was third in line and BOTH cars in front of me had orders that were screwed up. Thought maybe they'd get one order right...but I was wrong. I get to the window and the girl hands me a drink (which was not part of my order). Told her that I had not ordered a drink. She says \"well WHAT did you order?\"  She took the order to start with and had everybody's orders wrong. MAnager came over, told me I owed them more money. This was Tuesday Dec 6 at around 4:00 pm. Need to get regional Mgr out there and clean house!!!"}
{"text":"Their original and grilled chicken are regular favorites in our house. It seems to be popular with everyone else, too, as I often have to wait an extra 10 minutes while they cook another batch. The staff is always friendly and efficient. The location is convenient, too."}
{"text":"The costumer service here is awful. 

Last time we ordered delivery.. they messed up on the \"hot and spicy\" (ordered 8, got 6 in \"original\" style). No napkins were included, same goes for the hot sauce. It's like no one bothers to pay attention when finishing the order. 

Oh and they fuc*ed up on the special instructions too. Specifically asked to \"Call first, come to side door\", which was completely ignored as the delivery guy disturbed the cranky physically-impaired lady upstairs. 

Why am I paying $5 for delivery when they don't even bother to do it right or even READ?! There's places that do delivery for free and gets it right. Not a dime will be spent on food from this place again."}
{"text":"First time I went it seemed like the whole staff was on drugs and I actually didn't get my food, but the second time couldn't have gone smoother got my chicken fast. Would return"}
{"text":"Refusal to give a kid a courtesy cup of water! We live in Arizona & from what I understand it was 100°F today, the kid was drenched in sweat and you would not give him a cup of water?? WOW  making $0.50 is apparently more important than helping prevent a heat stroke. Did I mention it was for a kid?! Unbelievable!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting!  I walked in shortly after it opened to get a drink.  No customers there.  The floors, tables and counters are all dirty ( yet no one there).  So obviously it hasn't been cleaned from day before.  No one greeted me.  Waited 5 min.  Still no one.  Went to restroom, and it was beyond gross!!   Stalls all dirty, one even when blood on floor under toilet.  Went back out without using restroom.  I finally had to call out for someone. A young girl came up.  Got me the drink.  I asked to speak to manager, and Indian guy I believe.  I could here her ask to come out from behind wall. He obviously said no cause she came out and said, \"can you come back later, he's on computer right now. \".  Don't go here!  Can't believe it passes health inspections."}

I think that was her name and the girl taking drive-thru orders and the tall man I believe was the manager.... You kept a loyal customer and I will be back!!! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Awful place reminds me coffee time, my sandwich was cold and hard , nothing is fresh , pouting was cold and tasting like old"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!!! Sign at the Drive Thru was not lit up so we went in only to wait 30 min in line. Did I mention we were the 2nd people in line. They ran out of almost everything by 6:30pm and when we showed our digital coupon to add 1pc to our 8pc meal, they said it had to be printed out!!! Had I known this, I could have driven home in the 30 min I was in line. Oh, and I'm still here waiting for my order. NEVER again."}
{"text":"If I can give this a negative 1star I will. It's the worst customer service ever! Never gets the order right and rude effin workers. This guy at the drive thru is such a jerk. The name on the receipt is Jorge... I ask if the combo comes with the drink and he's so damn rude. You don't say \" not for 2bucks combo u don't get drink\" well bitch it was just a question. Need more customer service training.

And need to clean your ears dude! Listen carefully so you don't messed up the order. There's a big difference between two and four ok. Never come to this location. Employee sucks!"}
{"text":"They had 2 grilled thighs left. We wanted 3, but took the 2. Should have taken that as a hint and found another KFC. Those 2 thighs were left way over the allowed time. So dry, they were shrinking. The extra crispy thighs were also past the allowed time.  The coating had a burnt flavor to it and the meat was dry, but not as dry as the grilled thighs. Very disappointed as we used the  drive thru and went home to eat  it, where we discovered it was not fit to eat. Not even for our dogs, if we cant eat it we certainly are not giving to our girls! Never had this at any KFC anywhere, so defiantly staying away from this one. 
The time was about 1:30pm, I believe that chicken was from the noon rush."}
{"text":"If u go here in the daytime you'll probably like it better when it's a few people there and you'll get fresher chicken. But at night you'll be chancing it, homie....for some reason every time I pass this place in the evening, it's more vacant than a graveyard at night.....and when I got my order in the drive thru the chicken tasted like it was sitting out for a loooong time...all oily tasting and shit....I personally believe it's cuz the night crews at fast food joints generally don't care cuz it's mostly young kids in there....stick to the daytime ordering for fast food (Here at least)"}
{"text":"The food here was exceptional salty.  The \"butter\" and \"honey\" was artificial, the potatoes and gravy were pasty tasting. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Went to this location, asked the cashier if there were any deals. She had stated \"no, but you can purchase the 5 dollars fill up\". I got out my phone and checked online and found 20% off any feast on the KFC app. I had shown the cashier and she had to get verification from the manager to see if it was valid. The Managers face did not show a pleasant expression.  Service was good to that point until I got home and checked my 8 piece family feast and found that 6 out of my 8 pieces of chicken was the smallest pieces of chicken I have ever been given from a KFC restaurant. This will be my visit to this KFC."}
{"text":"The 5 dollar chicken box is worth about ONE dollar. Two of the tenders had less meat that one McDonald's chicken nuggets and those nuggets do not have much meat in them. Plus the 3rd tender was only one star even with much more meat in it."}
{"text":"Food was hot but meh.  What got me was the service charge added to my bill for using a debit/credit card.  Really?!"}
{"text":"The guy on Cash was the worst employee Ive ever seen. My service was ok but the people in front of me, he gave them so much attitude. 

Got stuff from their Taco Bell Menu. They forgot to give me some of my order which I didnt realize till I was home so that sucked. I didnt care enough to call in and complain or anything though. 

My advice double check your order before you leave this location they forget stuff.
Food was as good as taco bell can get lol."}
{"text":"Chicken was not cleaned properly before cooking. Tasted bad. Was also very tough. Breasts should not be tough, especially since this is pressure cooked first. No flavor in meat. No biscuits, (machine Broken). Expect better quality from a national chain."}
{"text":"Bad service. Cashier named Peachy was awful and had major attitude. Definitely was not a peachy person. My order costed $5.05. when I gave a $10, she was angry I didn't have any change. Repeatedly saying \"Do you have anything?? 5cents, 10cents, 1 dollar??!\" In an angry tone. Stunned at her attitude, I politely stated \"No.\" I don't think she thought things through when she stated if I had a dollar in change either anyways. Terrible service."}
{"text":"As stated by others, I should have read reviews before coming here. No greetings when you come in. Soda was out and when I told them they said they already changed it. Barely got a new cup. The two pieces of fish we got tasted out and were small. The kids meal tender looked like a X-large nugget. No drink lids or napkins. Not happy for wasting time and money!!"}
{"text":"If they want people to come there then should be nicer because I was there with my husband and the lady working there was giving me a dirty look and instead of handing me the receipt nicely she just threw it on the counter I think me and my husband will not go there again."}
{"text":"Your only as good as your last meal.  Well this is our last meal at KFC.  Over $30 for 12 pieces of chicken and 3 sides.  The sides were great.  Customer service was slow and a little on the rude side.  We asked if we could get legs and wings since the meal was mainly for our kids and we were told no problem.  I have to learn to check orders before we leave but I don't understand why we have to.  If we told them what we wanted and they put it on the receipt then why can't the order get right.  It was not just original in the container and it also had thighs and breasts.  My kids were not happy.  We also ordered this with mashed potatoes, cole slaw (which was dry) and the potato wedges.  No potato wedges but instead another mashed potatoes and gravy.  Didn't want to go back and deal with the poor customer service.  KFC seems to be really loosing the quality of product.  Seems like that is happening across the board.  Maybe it is time to bring back the mom and pop restaurants."}
{"text":"I hated KFC for the longest time. But a few months ago I needed to grab a quick lunch & went to the drive thru. I have been here 4 times total & I get the same thing every time, mashed potato bowl. I also get a biscuit & yesterday I got a lil parfait, strawberry. The cheese on top of the chicken pieces, corn, gravy & mashed potatoes was barely melted, yuck. The biscuit was pretty good & so was the parfait. Why only 2 stars? I've definitely experienced better!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late night bite and for a corporate place I've never known a place to close early? Drive thru. Hours said ther open till 00:01? Makes no sense but online said ther. Open till 11:00pm we arrived at 10:34 waited at the voice box for five minutes drove up To the window and was ushered away by the window guy saying they were closed very disappointed in the customer service and the nonchalant gesture that was given to us to go away"}
{"text":"They almost pride themselves on getting your order wrong. Several times IN A ROW they forgot something. Make sure you ask for napkins, sauces, and utensils. Absolute failure."}
{"text":"- Rude employees
- Cold food
- Missing items

- Long wait (as the only customer)

Avoid this KFC, too much went wrong for this experience to have been an accident. Im guessing a disgruntled manager has gone rouge."}

I will never give this location a chance. I will now utilize the new KFC on south Stephanie street."}

Because Im used to it by people at the restaurant where I work at... anyways so we roll up to the drive thrue and we order a 2 family fill up to take home after a hard day at work and the guy says \"umm we only have 3 pieces of chicken left and it'll take 25 minuts to make it\" so I said \"we'll wait for it\" and he shroans and said \"ughh OK\" and he says \"$40 just pull up by the parking lot \" and if they come give me a shitty family fill up I am going to throw that chicken in their fucken face and ask for my money back

{"text":"These employees are the worst. The service was horrible and their accuracy matched.  I worked at a Kfc for years so I knew what game they were playing. Heads up if they don't give you the original receipt it's because they are doing something that will upset you and they don't want to receive bad reviews on mykfcexperience.com. That would mean the manager doesn't get their bonus. Poor them. Additionally don't bother with calling the store. They won't answer."}

Drove all the way home before I noticed the extra charge. Tried calling- their phone number doesn't work! Had to drive all the way back and ended up returning the whole order. Do not go go here!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible franchise owner.  Pathetic.  I like KFC and I will eat it about 4 times a year.  This particular KFC is closest to me so I have been quite a few times over the past 2 years.  Without exception, this KFC franchise (I assume its a franchise store and not company owned) is consistently inept, unprofessional, and unorganized. Always a wait for something, which typically means the owner cares more about minimizing food use and cares nothing about their customers. Moreover, any half-intelligent employee is never there a month later.  Just returned from there and apparently the shift lead woman cant count - got 8 \"chicken bites\" when I ordered and paid for 10, and 3 of those 8 were visibly overcooked. I returned on principal  to let them know, and this shift-lead lady got mad at me...as if I would drive 5 miles home, eat 2 \"bites\", and come back 20 min later WITH the 8 in the box looking to scam KFC out of 2 \"bites\".  This KFC belongs in North Vegas, not Henderson.  AVOID THIS GHETTO-KFC."}
{"text":"2 Soft Taco Supreme

The best. The absolute best."}
{"text":"It's veen almost a year since we've eaten here and decided to give it another shot. On the plus side, they were open as posted on their business hours. Unfortunately that was the only thing going for them...

I can deal with a long wait time in the drive thru when I receive fresh food. That was far from what I received. I ordered a 8pc family meal with an extra side and 2 small Nashville chicken littles. The chicken was soggy and very oily, ALL of the sides were cold including the biscuits. 
The little chicken sandwiches were hot and fresh but the Nashville chicken was NOTHING as advertised. It had a very small (and the sandwiches are small to begin with) squirt of red sauce that was just in the middle of the chicken. The hot sauce packets have more in them then what was in the actual sandwich. 
The coleslaw was bubbling! My husband ended up going straight to the bathroom after the small amount that he ate of it. 
We live less then a mile away from here so I know that the food didn't get cold due to the drive home. Normally I would call and complain but at this point, I didn't even bother. If they are going to serve paying customers ($30 bill) this, I highly doubt they are going to care if I call to complain. We ended up just tossing the food out and munching on cereal. 
Yep, never going to spend money here again."}
{"text":"Worst place ever No care for customer service !!! Takes 1/2 hour to get order as they don't have chicken cooked Orders wrong Once ordered the Big Crunch sandwich and got home with only 1/2 a bun Stay far away"}
{"text":"Locations shows open till 10pm but it's not. Workers had locked the doors and drive through rep advised they weren't taking orders. Wow!"}
{"text":"Since it's close, I'll admit the potential sin of a Taco Bell/KFC run or two. We all have our fast food indulgences. 

My review is not so much about the food as it is the staff, service and overall management. This store is consistently SLOWWWW (ok, maybe I come here more than I should...). By slow, I mean that the in-store cashier has a line of 6-12 receipts lined up on the counter as they work to deliver food. I ordered a fresco bean burrito and fresco soft taco and waited 20+ minutes (yes, really) for my order. 

I most certainly was not the only disgruntled one. 

By now, I should have learned my lesson and known to avoid this place like the plague if you have any desire to enjoy the next 30 minutes of your life. I don't know about you, but sitting for that long inside or in the drive-thru for a simple order is just beyond ridiculous. If it happened just once, I'd let it slide. But this seems to always be the case. Hearing the other upset customers while I'm waiting just makes the experience that much worse. At least I'm not the only one...

I'm speculating, but I think it's a cheap management issue where they don't want to hire enough employees for cost, therefore they have poor service. (The signs in the windows about how they will charge extra for sauces and not honor certain standard coupons only reinforces my opinion. But again, just my opinion.) Go to another location."}
{"text":"Not the best service. 
But when they messed up on my order and I got home seen it wasn't all there and they just closed. So I called and told them and they fixed it. Went in the next day and got the right meal for free. 

So I give them about a 4 because they fixed what they messed up on."}
{"text":"Walked in, staff chateering since there was no customers but me. 
Tables and chairs, half of them with food crumbs. 
Food, old. Mash and gravy were in a half melted top from being under the warmer tooooo long. 
Buscuit, broke it in half, all hard. 
Chiken, extra dry. 
Wow 
Asked them to serve me fresh meal.  
No appologies no service.  Bad management. 
Ate in. Still no clean tables and seats."}
{"text":"Great experience the other day the young man that took our order I believe his name was Michael was very friendly to my children and went out of his way to help! Food was accurate which is something to be said with a taco bell. Overall quick and helpful service from both employees we dealt with.  Happy with this location for sure"}
{"text":"Very upset!!!! Asked for a 10pc all legs at 7:30pm told they didn't have it.... never asked if we wanted xtra crispy or original gave us what they had... looks like it was fried 2 or 3 times super greasy and gross.. asked for coleslaw and didn't get it... no napkins no silverware awful!!!!!!!!! Horrible place to go"}
{"text":"Tried the Tennessee hot. I don't think its health but it's pretty damn good!"}
{"text":"I wish I could rate this place no stars because this Kfc Sucks Complete and Utter Ass. The Service is shitty and every time I go In the drive thru I have to wait a minimum of 15-20 minutes, then they have the audacity to charge me .39 if I pay with a debt card. I decided to try going inside to see if anything was different but it seemed worse. I was not greeted as I entered ,  but instead was starred at by the drive thru employees like I was a zombie . The manager Brenda has a horrible attitude. She got upset when I asked for a recipe, and as she headed to the back I could hear her yelling at her employees as if they were her children. I will not be returning to this location again and I advise anybody that  wants to have a good meal and great customer service not to either."}
{"text":"Very clean.  Looks like all updated / remodeled inside. Very friendly, curtious staff. Good food."}
{"text":"Don't use a debt card with them.
I have to pay additional 39 cents to use my card.
+ one time my bill was 22.00 they charged my card 222.00 ..it took 2 days for bank to reverse the charges..
K F. C is a known nightmare...
Food is terrible..services are badly.
Last time we ate there er all got sick.
We got bad stomach pain.
I think half their food is rotten.
Bad place.

{"text":"Went  to this KFC and  when friends & I walked in, the PIC rudely stated that he was closing the dining room. 

Don't know if it was because they were getting ready to close the store or they didn't order the right amount of food, but was told by other customers that they were out of food. Either way, this place did not score well on Customer Service!"}
{"text":"So disappointed!!! Ordered in the drive-thru, and was told the biscuits would be another 4 minutes until they were ready. I was told to park and they would bring it out to me. After 10 minutes went inside and asked the manager if my food was ready? He said he didn't know. Told him what I was waiting for and after 5 minutes they gave me my food. Driving home and my daughter looks in the bag and sees they gave us fingers and Mac n cheese. We ordered chicken and potatoes. So we go back through drive-thru and I tell them the order is wrong, Can I please talk to a manager and have my receipt, since I never got one. And no they can't accommodate me. I did get the right food finally. Unfortunately now I know, never go there again!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a 3 piece original meal . 2 thighs and a drumstick, with mashed potatoes  and coleslaw and  a few biscuits ordered an extra one . Came out hot and fresh . This is the 1st time I been to KFC in a while . Chicken a little on the small side. but still tasty none the less"}
{"text":"Wasting a lot of money on advertising, I went there twice they have shorted me on my drive thru order. I call they didn't give me a receipt so she said sorry I can't help you. Really ? Why do you think I wouldn't get a receipt ?  This is bull crap.  They say there under new management. I have one simple suggestion maybe like other places you should double check your orders."}
{"text":"This could be a five star location if they hired more staff!!! You can wait longer in line to be waited on than it takes to prepare the food."}
{"text":"This is KFC is awful. The only plus is that it's open until 11PM. At night, they let the phone ring and ring before they answer. The gal I spoke to over the phone was very unprofessional. I asked if they still had chicken (because last time they were out) and she said \"uhh yeah I think so\".  She ended the phone call without even asking for the name on the order. I placed my order and arrived there shortly after. When I arrived I had to hunk a few times. It seemed as if the employees were hiding. When someone finally came to the window, her first response was \"yeah?\" The order wasn't ready because they never placed the order. The two gals that work there are very unprofessional."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place.  I'm not usually into KFC but their menu looked pretty appealing.  My boyfriend and I got a burrito, the big boss sandwich, and a mango salad to take out.  The staff at the counter were a bit disorganized inside.  The burrito had no flavour except for the massive amount of sour cream, which made it unappetizing (I didn't finish it and that's unheard of for me!).  The bun was falling apart on the sandwich and it seemed very bland too, like it was missing something.  The best part of the meal was the salad, which was a decent size and had a nice spicy dressing, but the mango was a bit mushy.  Overall we were pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"This KFC/Taco Bell is the worst.  Unfortunately, because it's right around the corner from my house it has typically been my Taco Bell of choice.  However, after today I will gladly drive to another location and spend my money there.  This location is consistently slow.. Expect a 15+ minute wait in the drive-thru no matter the time or day.  I waited 18 minutes today with only two cars ahead of me.  Then when I got home, half my food was missing (shock shock) and the food I did get was badly burned.  

They also close earlier than the posted hours, pretty much whenever they feel like it seems.  So don't try to go there if it's within an hour of closing time.  I've had them close early two or three times in the past, so it seems to be a regular thing. 

The franchise owner seems to be a real winner. As other reviewers have mentioned, they slap you with a \"service charge\" for paying with a card.  And last year the air conditioning inside the restaurant was broken for a month (employees told us the franchise owner didn't want to pay to fix it).  Sorry, but in Phoenix in the middle of summer, you need air conditioning! The staff themselves are fine. They're not friendly, but they're not rude.  They seem pretty apathetic in general and will give you a generic \"sorry for your wait\". I don't really blame them since they work for an awful franchise and I'm pretty sure they probably get complained at a million times a day about all the above mentioned problems that are probably out of their control.

In the future I'll take the 20 minutes I would spend in line here and drive to another location.  This place is ridiculous."}
{"text":"I have never been inside only drive thru. It is the local KFC for the keele area  I only choose this one if the one near my house in Brampton is going to close."}
{"text":"I drove twenty minutes on a Friday to get my family dinner. I arrived at 910 pm and they are supposed to close at 10. The employees had already closed everything up.When I placed my order they gave me some lie about they just sold all the chicken and we would have to wait 20 mins for more and fit the fryer to heat up. They closed everything up early. Such a terrible experience. Would not recommend.Will be contacting corporate."}
{"text":"Nice to charge your customers for two sauce packets when they buy FOUR dinner combos from you. Why would you have sauce if you're just going to charge for them?? Seriously I get people go over board with sauces but when I saw my receipt I couldn't believe it. For two sauces? Wow. I won't be back.

Cookies were hard and stale. Disappointing chicken portions compared to what was advertised."}
{"text":"Horrible service, slow and no sense of caring.

Run down location, doors do not work, washrooms a mess, flooring falling apart.

Would not accept the \"online\" coupon on my phone.

And just for some sub par chicken....."}

{"text":"Tonight I received a bonus on my tostado.  I had a label mixed in with my toppings.  It was an entire label, about 1 in x 2in. in my lettuce!  Every time we go there I swear never to go back. Last visit order was wrong and I was overcharged. Slow, never been through the drive thru in less than 20 min."}
{"text":"Wow this KFC should've been the first one to close down instead of all the other good ones that got shut down!

Ordered a 6 piece family meal, they give me ONE ranch sauce. So which piece of chicken gets ranch huh?

Was craving Mac and cheese all day. Got so excited to go home and eat my Mac and cheese. Guess what?! They gave me mashed potatoes. 

Is it that flipping hard to get an order right? Besides the mistake I think the ranch sauce pissed me off the most. I get it, places are becoming more stingy, but ONE ranch sauce for SIX PIECE FAMILY MEAL?! Seriously?! 

If it wasn't because the three closest KFCs to me being shut down, I would've never went here. Never will again!"}

{"text":"Oh crap. They got virtually every order wrong the whole time we were here. No exaggeration. I dont know what they are like other days, but today, May 5 2014 between 5pm and 5:40pm - they had no idea what they are doing. Not just ours but SEVERAL customers' orders. 
They gave us fries we didn't order. They said there were NO BISCUITS so they offered us some other sides... we got the extra sides AND the biscuits.
We ordered chicken fried steak with NO gravy... but they put gravy in it and when we complained, they just took it back but no one offered to make what we actually ordered. We had to instruct them what to do. 
We didn't see any managers try to fix things. 
This employee named JONATHAN was totally and utterly clueless. Please KFC, you can do better than this."}
{"text":"I visited this KFC for lunch. I went in and got in line for my order. I was greeted promptly by a very nice cashier and she took my order, which I paid for very quickly. Two to three minutes later I had my order and it good. I recommend this KFC for a quick no hassle lunch."}
{"text":"This location has been here for years and has its good days....and its bad ones. Today was a bad day, for sure. Our cashier,  Charly, was very rude and kept making comments about how irritating the customers were. It was busy, but didn't seem busier than a normal lunch rush. My 7 year old son caught on to her negativity and questioned why she was being \"mean\".  Another woman behind the counter said \"I feel like quitting right now\", at least 3 times. There were 3 cars in the drive thru and 2 customers in the dining room. I understand the frustration of being understaffed  (not sure if this was the problem, just trying to find a reason for their poor service). It sucks when you're made to feel bad because of their frustrations. I am a paying customer...but didn't ask for the extra side of complaints. What's that old saying about taking the heat in the kitchen???? Oh yeah, if you cant take the heat....Get out!  Good customer service is so hard to find. People don't realize that they have the opportunity to change someone's day. We won't be coming back. Good thing Popeye's opened up a Gilbert location."}

{"text":"This is a KFC/Taco Bell location. Customer service is atrocious. Super long wait with the restaurant empty and no other cars in the drive through. Tried the KFC and the Taco Bell. All I can think is that these people need to get their lives together. I laughed a little when I asked for fire sauce packets and she only put four in the bag. I asked for more and she dropped in a few more. I reminded her what my order was and said that I would need at least one packet per taco. She then began dropping them in one or two at a time. The food quality is sub par even by Taco Bell/KFC standards. And both visits my orders were shorted items. Much better choices for tacos and chicken nearby."}
{"text":"I used to love Taco Bell. It was far and away my favourite fast food but when I was a young lad the only one around was at Scarborough Town Centre. Since going there meant a short RT ride but a hefty investment in bulletproof vests, my life was sadly lacking in the Bell.

Then I moved to the west end of the city and coincidentally right beside a brand spankin' new Taco Bell. It was love at first sight.

I think I'm just excited that they seem to pop up in convenient locations for me when I least expect it. The food is substandard mush not fit for human consumption but they keep calling me. It's that damn hot sauce I tell you. There's crack in it or something."}
{"text":"Absolutely the WORST KFC chicken we have ever encountered. Spent $22 and could not even eat the 10 wings and 6
strips we bought. Way overcooked, yet raw in some places. All of it also tasted like french fries. Gave the whole thing back to the manager on duty and was offered .... 
something else to eat! No way! Never again! Stay far, far away!"}
{"text":"Horrible ..... Worst.... Service.......
Never go back..... Mgr acts like there is no problem.... Quite evident they don't train their staff...."}
{"text":"Here's an example of why this place gets such a bad rating.  And, I'd give them no stars if I could. They ran a special for a 10 pc meal for $15.  Legs and thighs, and in the small print \"Extra charge for white meat\".  First, the manager on duty says \"no white meat on this special\".  So, we point out the fine print.  Then, he says, with a defiant look on his face, $2 extra per piece.  What?? $35 for a 10 piece meal? You're out of you're mind.  Just moved here from out of state yesterday.  How quickly they lost a customer. Will never be back."}
{"text":"The workers aren't very nice they are very disrespectful, but the food is kind of good , they don't heat the Mac n' cheese good enough. We ordered some and it was cold and hot. But the chicken is great I guess."}

I had to go back to the car for (get this)change... Come on people. Lmfao"}
{"text":"Amazingly, worse than I expected. Only 3 people on staff at 1 pm, which I would assume would be a busy time. And even though my coworker and I were the only people in line, it took a solid 4 minutes before they even took my order. I got my drink cup, and immediately decided not to use it, because the soda machine was caked in what was clearly a few days worth of filth. My food was fine, but the way it was handled was alarming. An employee went from emptying the trash to ringing me up, and them handed me my food, all without bothering to wash his hands. Frightening."}
{"text":"This is the worst KFC I've ever been to. It seems like every time I go there there's something wrong. They've screwed up my order a handful of times, and it seems like there's always something wrong. One time they were out of chicken for God's sake, and while I wasn't even there for chicken, it took twenty minutes for my Taco Bell. Then, I finally went back tonight and their credit/debit machine was down so all they could do was cash. I'm never going back, if I want KFC I'd rather travel the extra distance to another one. If I could give less than 1 star, I would."}
{"text":"The service is extremely unfriendly, the store is dirty, they don't have delivery so instead of ordering from another store you simply can't have it unless you pick up. It takes forever to get it and there seems to be more grease on this chicken than any other store.Gets me how they accomplish that. You're better off to PASS on that one"}
{"text":"I'm not going to this kfc anymore the people that run this kfc are gross & slow & sketchy. Always a long wait, and the food is NEVER fresh. I'm pretty sure they either save the unsold chicken to sell the next day or cook it all in a batch at once and just reheat it when someone orders. There's never a long line to justify the wait. Just stay away from this bad bad bad."}

{"text":"Last night we had unexpected company and we  decided to order KFC.  The chicken was greasy and there was a large pool of dark brown, almost black coloured oil at the bottom of the bucket, GROSS!!!!! Apparently the chicken was not drained, just thrown in the bucket.  Based on the colour of the oil they don't change the oil very often.  It was embarrassing serving the chicken to our guests.  I will not recommend this KFC location to our friends and neighbours. It is not worthy of even a one star rating."}
{"text":"Felt a craving for KFC so I signed up for their mailing list and got a coupon by email from it's website.  I printed out the coupon and took it down to this local KFC.  This KFC would not honor the coupon stating that they did not participate in the coupon offerings.  How can a KFC location not honor a coupon from it's website?"}
{"text":"Nasty place. I've seen cleaner rest areas. Soda scum across the counter. Out of forks. Smelly smoker employees. Layers of greasy scum on the front door. A black path of grease from the front door to the parking lot. Busted lights and cobwebs in all the windows. Frosted streaky windows. One wet napkin used to wipe down 10 tables. I think this place is going to put my Obamacare to the test in a few hours."}

{"text":"Been there three times, never had a good experience, I do like KFC BUT THIS ONE NEEDS new management. Once no sauce for my chicken, once I went right at 5 pm (early dinner) and they had no crispy strips ready only just a 15 minute wait while in the drive threw (I did not wait) big management problems"}
{"text":"My God! What has happened to you my beloved KFC? Why hast thou forsaken me??The past two times I've been to this location I have experienced the same problem--They never have the types of chicken I order (extra crispy vs. orig. vs. grilled), I still have to wait 10 minutes while they make my order, then my chicken is soggy and luke warm. 

I don't know what causes this to happen (I'm guessing incompetent management) but it will keep me from coming back. I hate when a restaurant self destructs because it can't provide the most basic of what we expect. Hot, fresh, good food just like we like it.

Get your act together KFC!!  (The slaw is still good, though)"}
{"text":"I gave them one star only because they served me chicken. The restaurant was not well presented and smelly and I really did not enjoy eating there."}
{"text":"This place is the most consistent restaurant I've ever been to in that they always get your order wrong.  It has to be some kind of intentional thing on the part of the owners because it is so consistent that it can't be accidental.  If you want to order a chicken breast, be prepared to receive a thigh and drumstick or maybe instead of chicken you'll just get French fries and mac n cheese.  What will these poor workers ever do in real life when they're expected to hold down a real job.  Beyond pathetic is too nice a review for this place.  Enter at your own risk."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've ever had. Been there several times since it's close to home. It's never been great service but I kept a going. After today I'll never go back. The person taking my order walked away and I waited 5 minutes and she never came back. So I left. Terrible and it's sad because I like KFC and it's so convenient. But they've lost my business."}
{"text":"Do not go! It took over a half hour to get a simple chicken dinner meal. Got our food 20 minutes after I was told it would only be 5 more. One gentleman came inside after waiting for his order in the drive through for 20 minutes. When we got the food home the lids had not been put on the sides correctly and gravy spilled over everything. Lobby didn't look like it had been swept all day. Kitchen looked worse. One employee looked like she was working hard. The rest seemed to not care. The franchise owner should be ASHAMED at the state of this restaurant but judging by other reviews they seem not to care."}
{"text":"Used to suck. Then it got amazingly better. We even started to eat there for about two years. Then recently it changes again - like theChicken tastes weird sometimes, bland other times. Crew doesn't look happy or on the same page..manager yelling at everybody....

We stopped going period. Tried drive thru after that.. Nothing but old chicken or they don't have 3/4's of what is on the menu. Just...man..piss poor ppl.

Tried el pollo loco..little better but not much. At least the chicken is fresher and no one is getting yelled at hahaha 

We are all done..3 families on the same block..done..over..out!

Terrible now. Get back to the level of service the last couple years and get the taste back an make SURE that when you are OPEN, you try harder to have the items on the menu and fresh. Many of us would wait for the food and sometimes do, but every time? You don't have anything made and always have to substitute. Just can't do that. 

Good luck because the company is generally good."}
{"text":"I'll be honest. I do not like writing bad reviews, but, I have had way too many bad experiences at this KFC to not comment. I have been coming here on and off for several years. The facility has been renovated and looks amazing. The bathrooms are always clean, but that is where the positive stops. 

Most of the time my order is wrong when going through the drive through. Often times there is no flat ware with my order. The wait is always long inside and in the drive through, even when there are no customers in line. I waited in line inside for over 30 minutes with no customers in front of me and no one else waiting for food. Then, my order was wrong. The staff are not necessarily unpleasant, but certainly not customer focused. The food is inconsistent. Got 3 biscuits, one was almost raw dough and the other two were dry and crunchy. The chicken is much the same. 

I keep going back hoping for change, but never see any. 

Again, I would usually not say anything rather than write a negative report, but this KFC has been continually under par with bad customer service, wrong orders and inconsistent food quality. Add in the long waits and this is certainly a place to avoid."}
{"text":"I should have read the reviews first but I was hungry so I oredered my order the guy comes to the drive thru window mad. No hello just 5.68 ok I hand him my money, he gives me my change. Next, my food he says Here. Slams the window. Ok where is my soda so I wait. Nothing! So I sat and finally 3 minutes later I'm knocking on the window for a while. Luckily a car behind placed an order.  So he sees me and walks away. Finally opens the window. I asked for my drink. He says whats your drink? I told him. He was saying something.  I said excuse me but you are very rude. He says he was telling his coworkers stuff.  I said may I have your managers name. He actually cursed and said it's not his problem.  I will notify corporate of this but like he said he don't care not his problem he stated. As these old reviews state the same poor management.  DON'T EAT HERE EVERYONE! !!"}
{"text":"This is a POORLY managed KFC, it never fails... something is always wrong or out! Tonight the manager told us she was out of hot sauce and to come back tomorrow!! What! I ordered cole slaw, got just add water mashed potatoes!! I called back to let the manager know over 4 times and the phone just rang and rang... I should have looked at the reviews before passing up over 10+ well managed restaurants that would appreciate my business."}
{"text":"They now charge for debit card fee!  Will never go back to KFC - they essentially stole from me!   These merchant fees are theirs to eat since there's also some cost savings to money counting and cash deposits.  These actually help them balance their books in a much more modern/simpler way but now their fees for debit are passed on to the consumer.  I will never go back to KFC!"}
{"text":"The worst KFC ever. If you want chicken they're out of it! Ha ha. Really! We were told it'd be a 4 minute wait ok no problem....we ended up waiting 28 minutes in our car for what they said would be 4 minute wait time. Watching customer, after customer getting irate with the employees when it is clearly the managers fault. This place does not have it together!!! I have even tried calling to see if they're going to be out of chicken because it has happened so many times and they don't even answer their phone. Can't wait for a new manager and maybe they can turn the place around! Horrible service!!!"}
{"text":"This is the WORST KFC I have been to.  I have tried it a few different time hoping it would get better. WRONG...... They are always out of something. Tonight at 7:20pm no sweet tea, no Mountain Dew, no wings. I waited 5 minutes to get butter. Four people looked at me but never asked what I needed. While there a guy came in he ordered 8 pieces got 4 thighs. I asked for original got extra crispy. When I asked them for sweet tea the gut said we're out have raspberry tea. If I wanted raspberry tea I would have gotten it."}
{"text":"WISH I COULD NOT EVEN GIVE A STAR! It's a random Tuesday night and my husband wanted to satisfy a craving of having KFC after a LONG day working in the Arizona heat! We got lucky and found one extremely close to our home....and to are surprise we pull up and it's closed 1 HOUR before what was posted on any websites saying there hours we're till 11pm!!! Even bothered to call and got am extremely rude man who said his name was \"Bob\" and offered me NO HELP!!!! Hope that was his real name....the customer service in 2016 is HORRIBLE!!!! THANK GOD WE LUCKED OUT AND WENT TO NATIVE NEW YORKER DOWN THE STREET! And without saying a word of our experience they took care of us in no time!!! Wish we had more people like this.... I'm definitely going to follow action and get some answers on why this location was NOT OPEN! I'm sure we weren't the only ones affected...."}
{"text":"Don't come here, I've come a few times and each time the experience is bull. I've gotten biscuits that are harder than a rock and now this time. I've been waiting in there drive thru  for over 40 minutes!!!!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive-thru and ordered 8 Piece meal and 4 extra wings.  Had to remind the cashier how much I gave her, since my change was $10 short.  Got home and the extra wings in my order were missing, and no receipt in the bag.  Called the store and asked for a manager and lo and behold, it was the cashier that waited on me.  She said I could drive back to the store and get my wings, the change shortage was not intentional, and that I must have misplaced my receipt.  I don't know how much KFC pays in advertising and promotions to get customers in the door, but it didn't cost much to get me to avoid them completely."}
{"text":"One day I was making some chicken, and when it was done, I looked at it and said to my wife, \"Damn - we can't eat that. That's disgusting.\"

So she threw it away and I drove to KFC, because we already had buns with mayo and lettuce, we just needed the chicken. They've got this new menu, and one of the things on it is called \"Tenders and Wedges for Two\" which is awesome, because that is exactly what I want. Now I haven't been to a KFC in like, 8 years. So how did I know the menu was new? Because when I ordered it, the guy at the counter had no idea what I was talking about. I mean he was cool about it - he wasn't an idiot - I was just apparently the first person ever to order that. So he called up two other guys and they all tried to find the item on the register so I could order it, and eventually the first guy found it, and everybody went back to chicken making.

And the chicken was pretty dagone good.  I totally recommend you make your own sandwiches, but then toss in a couple of chicken tenders. Delicious 'tendies' as some call them. And the potato wedges were great too.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.

So why not try it out? Chicken?!"}
{"text":"If I could select 0 stars i would. Went through the drivethru and they forgot my drink. While I was waiting for someone to notice me at the counter I over heard one of the shift managers talking to the girl working the drive thru. He was explainibg that the gravy needs to be in the bottom of the bag so that it does not spill in peoples vehicles to which she replied \"their fault. I think thats hilarious\" .....guess what happened when i got home. The bag hadnt even tipped in my vehicle but the gravy was sideways and the top was half off and gravy was everywhere. So pissed off."}

{"text":"This is one of the good ones.  I love this location. 95% of the times I get fresh chicken here.  Whereas, at other KFC, its always a hit and miss situation."}
{"text":"I ordered:

$5 Fill Up: Two-Piece Drumstick & Thigh
Two pieces of fried chicken, larger mashed potatoes, biscuit, medium drink and a chocolate chip cookie for just $5 (plus tax)

I received:
1 chicken breast
Regular mac and cheese
Biscuit 
Medium drink
Chocolate chip cookie

It would be a 3 star review if they got the order right."}
{"text":"Went to this particular location 6 times with the family. Every single time we went they were out of multiple items. The store was not even that busy, and these times we went were usually on Friday, Saturday or Sunday around dinner time 6-7pm. Everything we tried to order would be a 25-30 minute wait. Ended up just ordering whatever they did have on hand. We watched many potential customers get turned down when they tried ordering things because they were out of those items. We finally stopped going to this location due to so many attempts and all times they were not prepared to sell chicken. The Gilbert Rd & Baseline location seems to be much more prepared for dinner than this E. Main St. location."}
{"text":"It was the worst experience ever!!! Don't go there!! The employees don't even like their job! I asked for a bigger item on the menu, they wouldn't upgrade it! What happened to the customer is right! Really sad!!!!"}
{"text":"Tonight I got my lazy self of the couch to get some Taco Bell before the drive through closed at 10pm.  I made it at exactly 9:50.  There was still a car at the window,  but they weren't taking new orders.   They had gone ahead and closed up early."}
{"text":"Food is ok, but the restaurant need a major deep clean from top to bottom. Cushions are flat, there is grime everywhere, walls need paint, crumbs on the floor."}
{"text":"This place sucks not one table was clean and the girl behind the counter is loud and rude leave your personal shit out of the work place"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst KFC ever in the history of KFC this place is an absolute joke do not ever ever eat at this restaurant they are a total rip-off we just got a family bucket there was not one breast not one piece of white meat the chicken was undercooked the mashed potatoes sucked the gravy was burned overall it was just horrible do not eat at this KFC"}
{"text":"Ok, it's xmas season... I'm laying about, being a sloth, complaining about my hangover (as I usually do around this time of year).

So I's goes to KFC to get me my 'cure'.

Fine friendly service and the food was the same as all other KFC's.

Afterwards....
Did I feel better? No.
Did I smell better? Ya."}
{"text":"went in there today ordered a popcorn chicken bowl it had a whopping 4 pieces of popcorn chicken in it very very cheap stingy manager im sure its not regulations"}
{"text":"CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE YOU LEAVE. I did not check my order which was supposed to be all dark meat thighs and legs but when I got home and opened it that evening there was 3 wings and a breast substituted.  This was the second time I have been given a wrong order.  I will never again stop at any KFC. Albertsons chicken is better anyway."}
{"text":"I came in to try the wings and loved them. The chicken was fresh and employees were very friendly. Seen many new faces"}
{"text":"I just left kfc and I was impressed. Customer service was wonderful. Very nice employees and I was amazed how fast I received my order. 5 stars to the manager that trained employees so well."}
{"text":"I ordered the \"Big Boss + 1 drumstick\" combo for $9.49 + taxes. The order comes with the sandwich, one drumstick, a small salad of your choice & drink.

Without checking my order, they handed me an incorrect order of the \"Big Crunch\" (instead of the Big Boss). I pulled away and fortunately I noticed it as I parked my car in their parking lot and was about to eat when I came across the error.

So I pulled back into their drive-through and explained the problem. They were pleasant about correcting the problem and promised to fix the order. The funny thing was, as they're fixing my order, I look into the bag and noticed they even goofed on my salad, giving me a small macaroni salad (as opposed to the potato salad I ordered). At this point, they already started fixing the sandwich so I thought I'd leave the salad issue alone as I didn't feel like calling the girl back to let her know the salad was incorrect as well.

I finally get my order of the Big Boss sandwich. No word of a lie, the buns are slightly colder than room temperature. At this point I'm very upset. I'm also running late for work (I work the graveyard shift). 

If I wasn't running late for work, I would've parked my car, gone inside and spoken to a manager. This is the last time I visit this location."}
{"text":"Food is fine; same as other KFCs and Taco Bells. However, the wait is not tolerable. I've been to this establishment at least 10 times. I've never waited less than 20 minutes. The most recent was a 40 minute encounter from the time I arrived and the time I asked for my money back. I have left with no food on at least 3 occasions after giving up on the wait. I am a slow learner but I have learned. I will never again return."}
{"text":"\"We don't have crispy chicken because we are closing in two hours.\" OMG hahahaha. This crew needs serious re-training. No wonder they have 1.5 stars."}
{"text":"Very bad customer service. I've had a bad experience before and made a complaint. They sent me a voucher and thought why not try them again. 

The voucher isn't worth it for me to come back here again. It's really too bad because we really KFC's chicken. 

One of our complaints is that we were trying to add the chicken wings for $5 if we ordered a family meal larger than 8 piece which we did. Well they said that they can't do that because you can only get that on a fill up meal. Well if you see the picture it clearly states any 8piece or larger meal. 

Well the cashier was not only rude, but she was sassy and condescending. So I tried to talk to a manager who would not take our concern. Apparently she was talking to her general manager. Still no resolution. She finally come up to the window after waiting for 7 mins only to tell me that she can give the wings for $8 not $5. The. She proceeds to tell me. There's cars behind you so it's either you want it or you need to move! 

Really for me it's not about the $$$$. I wasn't rude or yelling at them but basically stating the facts. I feel like they were playing me for a fool. I doubt that he general Manager was actually on the phone with her. I feel like it's a complete lie!  I'm in the service industry and they were they treated me was disrespectful and very much condescending. I spoke with 800 #. Let's see if they were really going to call me back and address my concerns."}
{"text":"Ok ... KFC is not really \"review worthy\" cause it is terrible food.   But once in a blue moon, I fall for the nostalgia of how good kfc was when I was kid.  When they actually cared about the food they served.  
No ... the disappointment that prompted this review was about the greed.  $20 for 8 pieces of chicken is not too bad. But they now cut the pieces a different way so I can't even identify them.  Like what the hell is this (see picture). I thought it was a wing but no.  They also cut the white meat differently.  The pieces are so small and soaked in grease.  Just terrible. 
Now compare these to Popeyes - who has really upped the game and the colonel must be running scared."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, I love KFC and Taco Bell, but this was definitely a stomach-churning experience for me.  I agree entirely with Shaun E. as the environment is extremely filthy... don't even bother using the washroom.  

Anyways, the food was what you find at a typical KFC or Taco Bell branch.  However, the portions were surprisingly small? Especially for KFC? Idk if it's because I haven't had KFC for a while, but this really made me question if I was still getting a good deal for the buck or not...     

I probably will not be back however, due to the questionable sanitary practices."}
{"text":"If you don't mind the dirt, service is friendly and food is good.  Place needs a major deep clean.  No one here but garbage cans are full.... still if you have kids or want a place that's intimate by virtue no one is here then this is the place.  Kids can be theme selves and overall it is a relaxing dinner of your a single parent.  Just don't have high expectations on cleanliness."}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst KFC to go to avoid at all cost... chicken size and quality by far not worth the money. Be advised do not visit this one you will be enormously disappointed. No stars only rotten apples here... however I can not do a post unless I star them, I should be getting the star not this place."}
{"text":"I would give no stars if it were a choice. Rain, the apparent manager at this horrific KFC, was so rude and unprofessional after they messed up my food order. I ordered a doublicious sandwich as part of a big order and after sending it back because there was not supposed to be sauce on it, I discovered that they had merely turned it over so as to hide the sauce. I told Rain it was still incorrect and he told me it would be another 6-7 minutes. I had already been there for about 15 minutes and wasn't waiting any longer. I asked for my money back and rather than refunding the total amount, he gave me 39 cents less. When I asked for a full refund he said I must be hurting for money and finally threw a dollar of his own money at me after I insisted. When I asked for the store manager/owner, he told me to figure it out and absolutely refused to tell me the name!  Worst experience ever!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible even for a taco bell. I waited 25 minutes for 2 tacos that ended up being ice cold. When it read that other reviews had The exact same experience as myself, then that certifies that this taco bell is a perpetual POS and this will reoccur. Do not bother coming. Never coming to this garbage place ever again. Do not come here or you'll regret it"}
{"text":"Went to this KFC tonight, 04/28/17, and ordered two of the new zinger sandwiches. Both sandwiches had chicken that was completely raw. I'm surprised the health department hasn't shut them down."}
{"text":"Okay it's official Kentucky fried chicken has switched from chicken to pigeon this was the most God awful experience I've ever had it was beyond disgusting dried-up pigeon is what they serve along with all of their other fake ingredients at KFC KFC is nasty do not go there"}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru with my kids when they opened.  As I was placing my order you could hear yelling and complaining in the backround. Yes I did show up right when they opened, so what?! The employees were also rude when I got to the window, not to mention when I brought the food, to my grandmothers, who is sick, it was gross! The mac and cheese was cold, the chicken tasted like it was from the night before, and my kids wouldn't even eat it! Never again!"}
{"text":"Walked in stood waiting at the counter for several minutes. no one bothered to take our order. Finally walked out. Workers were standing around talking behind the counter talking"}
{"text":"Unbelieveable, thats sums it up. Went in on a Sunday with  a Sunday only coupon. The gal at the counter didn't know what to do with it. The manager came over and tried to input the coupon but it didn't work after l0 minutes of trying. Finally, he called his boss on his cellphone and still coudn't figure it out. Finally, he told me that the order is $20.42 although the order printed out wrong. Also, the gal behind the counter said that they were out of biscuits and it would be about l5 minutes before they are ready. I said forget the biscuits, so she gave me cole slaw instead. Needless to say, everytime I have went in this place, there always is a problem with the food or the service. Goodbye KFC, hello Church's."}
{"text":"Please hire a staff who understands English. That way, the customers can get their correct order."}
{"text":"Looking forward to some original chicken, while hubby wanted a double downer. On walking in we were a bit nervous as there was no one sitting in for food and no one in drive thru. The chicken I got was definitely reheated and was only ok, the wedges were cold and soggy. My husband couldn't get the double downer cos they only had one patty! He got a bbq burger instead, he ordered fries but was given the cold soggy wedges also. Our sodas were flat and tasted off. We won't be going back anytime soon!!"}
{"text":"I had hesitations about posting about this hidden gem. This KFC should be a model for othersin the chain as their food at this location is ALWAYS cooked perfectly and consistent. I wont go to another KFC.  The manager Jose has this place running so smoothly and it is always neat and clean."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner with the grandchild $41.21 later took forever to get our food it was incorrect it was cold and when you question the fact they're like oh we didn't ring it up oh we forgot didn't fix it instead charged us for more. The remodel is beautiful maybe they need to Remodel the staff. KFC chicken gets a bad rap but most of the time it tastes good let's just say it's not worth ever going back let alone to that location horrible service. I still think or do a refund because the chicken was like rubber and the order being incorrect but good luck seeing that unless we contact the bank and tell family paid for food and services that was extremely incorrect"}
{"text":"Visiting this KFC was surprisingly a good experience. They got my husband's and my order right. The drive through wasn't too slow. The employee in the drive through was pleasant. And she made accurate change. I did not go in the restaurant so I can not comment about the lobby. The food was reasonably priced. We ordered a five dollar meal. Decent deal. Pretty competitive for fast food prices right now. This fast food restaurant did a good job!"}
{"text":"Come on, really? You're gonna serve my kids chicken strips that have been sitting for God knows how long? They're not even edible.  The only reason we bought this crap is because we were busy with Christmas shopping.  The last you guys could do is serve fresh product during your dinner rush.  You obviously don't know the Cardinal rule of food service...\"you don't serve anyone food you wouldn't serve your grandmother\". But maybe you guys would.  You should be ashamed of yourselves for treating your patrons like this. My kids even suffered through and ate this crap because they were absolutely starving. I took one bite out of my meal and spit it out.  Atrocious. I'm not going to not do anything.  I'm going back and getting my money back."}
{"text":"this past easter i placed an order   the girl lost the ticket or plain forgot. after 30 min's  of waiting  i asked the girls at the counter were's the order no one knew after geting mad a black male that works there told me to go to church;s  chicken. what a bunch of low life drop outs! that work at this location. the chicken is slim like super models! and dry! by the way church's is 110% better than this dump!"}
{"text":"These people must be trained to short the customer on their food, Not the first time this is ridiculous chicken tenders are equivalent to about one bite each and also only two potato wedges in the Box you call this a fill-up meal what are you going to fill up a mouse never again KFC you con artist blind pos!"}
{"text":"Ever since this place was renovated, the customer service and atmosphere has change dramatically in such a good way. Food has gotten so much better to, love it!"}
{"text":"Holy Crap!!!!!!! WORST meal I have had in close to my life. Mother's Day was taking chicken to grandmothers home for her and 9 others. When looking up the number for Sun Lakes KFC I came across the yelp reviews and did however read some of them which were horrible. I thought they cannot really be that bad and thought I would decide for myself and went and picked up the chicken and the sides fo the 10 of us. Well!!!!!!! The yelp reviews were accurate absolutely spot on. This was worst chicken I have ever had. The chicken was not only all breading but bad breading with horrible salt aftertaste. I spent 68.00 for the food for 10 of us on Mothers Day and we threw it away and picked up pizza. This place needs to close down or clean it up. I do not by any means want you to think that this review reflects all KFC locations as that is not the case. I have had KFC just 2 weeks before in another location and it was fine. This place however is not fit for a meal. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE. I WOULD HAVE GIVEN ZERO STARS IF THAT WAS AN OPTION."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, and ordered the grill chicken. Once I got down the street and checked my box, I had original chicken. Went back to get grilled, because I am not a fan of the original recipe. The guy at the window took the box, and came back, and handed the box back to me through the window, box was wide open,and said \"is this ok?\" Then, when I got home, I realized my cookie was not in the bag. Will never eat here again!!"}
{"text":"After a really long day at work I stopped by this KFC for a quick dinner. I ordered the dinner chicken tenders and potato wedges and coleslaw. When I got home I found that the chicken tenders or so drive out that I couldn't eat them even the dogs will eat them. The potato wedges were also dry it out like they've been under the warmer for hours. The only thing that wasn't messed up with the coleslaw and that's because it came from a jar they couldn't mess it up. I called and talk to the manager there and she apologized profusely. I told her that that didn't help me with my dinner because I hadn't eaten yet. She said I could come back and she would replace the dinner. I told her I didn't have another half hour to drive up there and back to get my dinner why doesn't she bring the dinner to me. She said oh no I'm not allowed to leave the store. So I told her that she had lost a customer for life and that I would be writing this review for you. I give this restaurant a one-star rating because you can't give them a zero"}
{"text":"My family's butt is still raw from the contaminated food we got from there last night. This place is a dump!!!!"}
{"text":"Every time that I have attempted to order here I have been told that they are out of chicken breasts for the day! Are you kidding me? Close this place down!"}
{"text":"Poor service.Sloooow.  Workers are yelling at each other in front of the customers. Dirty store!!! Trash all over the floor. Avoid this KFC"}
{"text":"this place has terrible customer service! 
\"lucio\" who works there, was the rudest, person. i don't know if he is manager, but if he is, he shouldn't be. i will be making a phone call to his boss. he has no idea what good customer service is! he needs to be looking for a job where he doesn't have to deal with people! n i also would give it a zero star if i could. neither i or any of my 50 plus employees will go there again!"}
{"text":"KFC wanted to try something different. But KFC is comfort food. Who wants to eat at KFC when there is no fried chicken pieces or any familiar menu items at all? Utterly confounding and irritating. 

The previous restaurant here was a KFC/Taco Bell. It was sort of run down and set in the 80s decor and they didn't even have full pieces of chicken but we came again and again and again because the staff were polite and friendly and the food was decent and cheap. Oh- and the fountain soda selection was incredible. They had Dr. Pepper! That place was great and it was nearly always full of customers. I miss the sweet staff members there - they were golden.

Fast forward to today where this miserably executed marketing manager's wet dream / disaster sits. This place will be closed and replaced with another Subway or yet another Starbucks or McDonalds within a year. I gave this place two chances. Both times the entire staff seemed to be under the effect of some sort of mental fugue and couldn't feign interest in customers at all. I watched in horror as the transaction in front of me dragged on for what seemed like forever because everyone behind the counter was completely spaced out. I honestly wondered if they were under the effects of some sort of environmental sickness as a result of the reconstruction. But then again, that wouldn't account for everyone poking on their phones behind the counter. 

So, bad customer service as long as the food's good, right? Wrong. Burgers were awful. So bad... no fries, no classic neon green coleslaw, just a bunch of psudeo-upscale crap that I can only imagine the target market (office drones) turn their nose up at. Weird and tasteless waffle chips. Unremarkable overpriced dry burritos. Tiny portions. WTF moments all over the menu. Nothing resembled familiar food there, so why even bother with the KFC brand at all?

Like I said earlier, this is some marketing manager's dream come true - to upscale KFC and make it an upscale \"dining experience.\" Fail, fail, miserable fail. This is a blight on  the KFC brand. Run far, far away. 

KFC is not cuisine, nor should it be."}
{"text":"I went thru drive thru tonight and was absolutely disgusted at what I saw. While we were waiting at window to pay and get food, the guy getting our drinks filled up our cups using the ice that was sitting in the catch-all tray under the fountain machine. I could not believe my eyes.  When the other guy came to window to collect money I immediately said I am not taking those drinks because he just filled up the cups with ice from the nasty tray under the fountain machine. All he said was \"ok\" with a shit grin on his face.  I told him he was gonna give me 3 empty cups and i would go inside to fill myself. He said he would give to me when I came inside. I said you will give them to me now, which he did. Then of course, I got home and realized I paid with cash and he so conveniently forgot to give me my receipt. So here I am signing up for my first yelp review.  I will never eat here again!"}
{"text":"We went to pick up just a bucket of chicken and biscuits.  We didn't want any sides.  Guess what?  The won't sell you just chicken.  Are you kidding me.  Won't be going back.  So since we were headed out to a picnic, we went ahead and ordered the meal.  We asked for plates and utensils they asked for how many.  When we got to the window they forgot the plates and utensils so we had to ask again.  When we finally got to our destination we realized they hadn't given us any napkins.  Fried chicken with no napkins.  Won't be returning to KFC, mainly because you can't buy just chicken."}
{"text":"What is the reason that 2 sauces are given for 6 tenders and two sandwiches?   Your stinginess will cost you sales. Who needs to beg for a little sauce with their expensive fast food?"}
{"text":"Worst place ever. Not only did they get my order wrong, they didn't put CHICKEN in our chicken sandwich! All it had was cheese and bacon between two buns! Our sodas were filled with ice that the straw would not fit and they were flat. The girl working the drive thru seemed nice, but I would have preferred to have gotten what I ordered."}
{"text":"Terrible service!!! Employee was being a smart ass in the drive thru. Playing dumb doesn't help anyone.. I know the difference when someone doesn't understand and someone's making me to look a fool. I literally drove off middle of the order. Get your shit together kfc Rainbow.. went right down the street to churches with excellent service. Hope your store gets shut down."}
{"text":"The worst chicken I ever had they where way to salty. The chicken was also hard on the outside, and uncooked in the inside. If I could give 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. I went through the drive thru & from the window u can see everything theyre doing...there were only 2 teenagers working at the time. I orders 2 famous bowls & a side of biscuits. The girl started making my bowls then set them both down & left them open to go flirt with a customer in the dining area at the register leaning all over the counter. The other worker finally came & finished my bowls. I only live a block away but sure enough all my food was cold when I got home."}
{"text":"Was craving KFC for a while, Love their Famous Bowl! However food is pricey for what you get it, they charge .39 if you pay with card and they don't take bills larger than a $20! They also take forever in Drive Thru!"}
{"text":"This KFC store serves extremely dry chicken apparently left over from lunch.  Don't order chicken earlier than 6:00 PM during the week because they just reheat chicken left over from lunch. This is absolutely the worst KFC store that I have ever visited -- Store Number D212101.  We ordered carryout and the chicken was so bad that my wife drove all the way back to the store to return it.  We will never buy food from them again."}
{"text":"The food was terrible and very, VERY greasy. When we went we were told they didn't have any chicken ready, so we waited and the food was so bad that we threw it away. They need to clean the kitchen because it does not look clean at all. Lastly, the service is very rude and they are definitely not fair. When my mom waited for the chicken she was told it would be ready in a few minutes, so she stepped to the side. A man came in and ordered and was told to wait as well, but the cashier offered him a drink while he was waiting! They need to get there staff properly trained."}
{"text":"Crispy strips and chicken burgers are good. Gave one of their burritos a try and didn't like it very much, actually ended up throwing out over half of it. Waffle fries are good as well (when they're fresh!) Overall a good attempt at something new for kfc but a bit on the pricey side. Worth a try if you're in the area but nothing worth traveling for."}
{"text":"One star because zero wasn't an option. After 15 min wait in drive-thru line, was yelled at by worker for her mistake.  I told her the amount she told me and she yelled at me. I cancelled my order directly.  No courtesy or apology . Rude ignorant ass people. I will never even look at kfc again."}
{"text":"This is America's worst KFC and I've seen em all!  Grey soggy chicken drenched in grease. Hard to tell what piece you're even eating. Highest prices I've paid at a KFC too. Can't believe I gave it a second chance, even worse this time around. I'm a reluctant Yelper, so if you're reading this it means the worst. Run!!!"}
{"text":"I waited for twenty minutes in the drive-thru, just to be told someone would be with me and then ignored. When driving away to leave, I saw three employees just standing around, talking to each other, as if no one was in the drive-thru. I decided to go inside and discovered the lobby had already closed. An employee came to the door and said they were changing headsets. I expressed to her my dissatisfaction with the level of disrespect and poor customer service I and my daughter received. She acted as if she could care less. I tried to submit a written complaint with KFC, but their website was acting screwy, so I don't even know if it went through."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would have.  They do not have their stuff together. The place was chaos, instead of using the number on the receipt they just randomly call out what orders are.  There were 3 people that never got their stuff, and the people working seemed confused.  Then our order came out and they didn't give us the napkins or utensils, I stood at the counter waiting for someone to acknowledge me, and they all ignored me till I rose my voice and said excuse me.  Then I didn't even get my whole order.  I will not come back to this location."}
{"text":"6 piece meal came with 4. One of which should have been popcorn chicken. Just go to canes."}
{"text":"Really not even 1  star.  The staff here is totally inept. This KFC has just kept going down hill the last several years and I rarely go there anymore,but,I have stopped there three times in the last two weeks to get a Pot Pie and each time it's been \"Oh, sorry we sold our last one.\" 
The cleanliness of the store is suspect as well. Staff appearance makes you question if you really want to eat food that they have handled.
I am giving up on going here and expecting anything more than a bad experience.
That's disappointing."}
{"text":"The worst kfc I've ever been to. 20 minutes I waited for extra crispy chicken and it was overcooked and the oil tasted rancid. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is the pits.  First off we ordered 2 Zinger Combos and a Chicken breast meal to go.  The young girl asked if we would like to add bacon and cheese for an extra .99 cents so we agreed.  When we got our cups we found out they were out of Raspberry Iced Tea.  When I informed the young man working there he told the manager who said ok and just stood there leaning against the shelves.  I then told the young girl who took our order they were out of tea and asked her if she could have them filled from the fountain by the drive up.  She asked me wait a moment and then came back and told me that she was informed by her manager that they were out of Raspberry Iced Tea.  I told her \"I know, I'm the one who informed them\".  She then told me that the drive up and front fountains were all connected so obviously the manager wasn't going to change out the cartridge so we went to fill up with the unsweetened iced tea only to find out that was also empty.  When we got our food home we discovered that the wedges were cold and soggy, the so called \"bacon\" was nothing more than a few bacon-bits sprinkled on the sandwich and instead of a chicken breast they gave us a thigh.  When we tried to call to complain all we got was a very fast busy signal as if their phone wasn't working or was off the hook.  Gee, I wonder why.  What a waste of time and $21.  Seriously?  $21 for 2 chicken sandwiches with bacon bits and a chicken thigh?    Never again.  Better off going to Albertsons and getting an 8 piece fried chicken for $7."}
{"text":"I went to this location today.    I spotted 2 major problems with this location.     I ordered an 8 piece family meal, with 2 sides.    I paid for my order,  when I looked over the bill,  I saw a .39 charge.  When inquired about it,  I was told by the lady behind the counter that is a SERVICE CHARGE for using a DEBT CARD.   I told her my card was a VISA / DEBT card.   she continues and say's when the card is swiped the machine automatically takes these types of cards as DEBT cards.  I told her that is because you didn't press the correct button on the POS system to take the charge as as CREDIT charge.    She said NO she CANNOT CHANGE IT BECAUSE THE CARD SCANNER READS IT AUTOMATICALLY, and she cannot change it.      I never in my life heard of this.   After writing this review I will be writing to the KFC franchise and address this issue.      My 2nd problem MY ORDER WAS WRONG.     No manager on duty.     Go to a different KFC,  and watch your wallet with this rip off location."}
{"text":"Customers beware- if Angel is working in the Kitchen be very very careful. I placed an order via the drive thru for a chicken sandwich and diet soda with \" no sauce\". Shortly after I received the order I opened it to make sure the order was correct. The order was not correct so I parked my car and tried to go back into the dining area. The facility was closed so another rep ran to the door to help me. Once I explained to him the order was wrong he took it back to Angel in the Kitchen. I watched Angel look at the sandwich play with it then toss it to the side of him. Angel then bent down unwrapped what appeared to be new bread and place a new piece of chicken on top of it. Angel then told his co-worker to tell me to walk into the busy drive thru to pick up my order. I told his co-worker no the drive thru is full of cars! They then rushed my order back over to me- upon driving away I noticed the texture of my sandwich was weird. I opened it and noticed Angel had placed the same bacon with the same sauce back onto the sandwich and just pretended to throw it away. I walked back up to the door and was  ignored by all of the staff. I walked up to the drive-thru window and asked to speak to a manager- Angel looked at me and walked away. After several times of knocking on the window. Duane the manager greeted me and immediately apologized for Angel's behavior and refunded my money. Please be aware of this cook- he does not care about t customer or what he does to their food."}
{"text":"Used the $10 10 piece dinner coupon and they wouldn't give me the mashed potatoes, gravy and cole slaw portion without paying $2 more. They said that it wasn't on the coupon, as if I can't read. Rather than argue I will be going to Popeyes who has a 10 for $10 promotion going on and my wife says the chicken is juicier and fresher tasting anyways."}
{"text":"If it were possible to give negative stars for this KFC Kentucky Fried Chicken I would. The customer service was pathetic. We were told they only had 3 thighs on hand and that if we wanted all thighs we'd have to wait 30 minutes. She told us she couldn't understand why people wanted \"dark meat\" and that she preferred drumsticks.  Duh!  Please do yourself and everyone else a big favor and let this business rot as bad as their customer service."}
{"text":"I officially give up on this location!  I would this give this location zero stars if I could. I stopped going through the drive thru because they could never give me 100% of my order. I ordered carry out inside and got home without everything I paid for...again!!  If you are charging me for all white meat, then give me what I paid for!!! It's just not that hard of a concept to grasp. It's super aggravating to get all the way home and not have what you ordered and paid extra for. Having to run back out to go argue over what was or wasn't in the bag is too inconvenient.  Sorry, but I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This is the third time that I have experienced horrible customer service placed an order and they couldn't even tell me after 30 minutes when it was done teach your people customer service I won't be back"}
{"text":"Under staffed first of all. Out of everything. But most importantly the place was disgusting. Not a single employee was wearing gloves. I'm pretty sure that no one had EVER mopped the floor or wiped a table.  I'll travel 20 mins out of my way to another 'clean' KFC next time"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!!! Waited 15 minutes for a 3 piece meal and a side. No manager in sight and nothing but just a bunch of lazy kids working there."}
{"text":"I got sick eating at this restaurant on a toonie tuesday event! Definitely would not eat here again! Food was dry and felt like it was sitting out all day, or at least for a few hours."}
{"text":"I found that KFC has really changed things.. and I am.. not sure it is for the better . 
The chicken is VERY salty. TOO salty. 
But i like their mashed potatoes and their coleslaw and mac n cheese. and the biscuits are good. 
I don't think that i would make this a habit, AT ALL."}
{"text":"This is a Taco Bell and KFC combine location my name is Joshua I was a customer there today August 20th 2017 if I could leave a negative star I would. When I pulled up to the drive-thru today I placed a simple order there was no cars in front of me nor behind me. When I pulled up to the window I was asked by the employee to park in front of the building because I was on there timer and it was going to be a minute. Now that is okay with me I am a very patient person but when it comes down to spending 15 minutes of my time sitting in my car waiting for my order at least get it right. Now this isn't even the start of my lecture after driving with my order I realized that I did not have spoons napkins or the salsa that I had asked for no biggie turned around went in and got it I got a cold shoulder from the employee because I stated when you're sitting outside for 15 minutes waiting for your food you should at least give me everything I need to enjoy my food AZ to utensils sauces that are ordered and things like that but that didn't happen. No when me and my wife started to eat our food I noticed that it wasn't right it was put together really fast there is holes in the tortillas of my soft taco no lie there was beans in the burritos when we ask for no beans because my wife is highly allergic. I let it go for a couple of hours me and my wife continue to talk about how hungry we wore so I decided to call. When I call I spoke to a gentleman named Carlos I asked him to speak to the manager in charge he said that she was too busy to speak to me. He asked me what my issue was so I told him he said that is fine come in and we will remake you order not keeping this in mind I had asked for a manager he said he was a manager well he lied have to drive in from my home in El Mirage Arizona to Sun City I arrived to find out he was not the manager I did meet the manager her name was Danielle and she was extremely rude before I even got the introduction she already had a cold shoulder and a bad attitude towards me she asked me what was wrong as I started to explain how my experience went she stated I will just remake the order for you as I was in the middle of explaining myself to her she cut me off in a rude Manner and simply ran to the back to go remake the order then Carlos came to the front with my order and the other customers that were in the store told me they could not believe how rude she was they told me I should call the corporate office I'll ask for the corporate number and Danielle said that there was not a corporate office to call liar she is a liar the company is privately owned but still is represents a corporation of KFC so I contacted them online they called me and I let them know what the issue was I refuse to let this go I'm going to post a review on every place that I can leave a review that woman should not be in that place of work anymore no matter what job you do if you are still reading this you can agree with me that you always have to protect the name on the building and put your personal feelings aside I hope you call me and fix this whoever owns this store thank you"}
{"text":"I have never experienced customer service like this in ANY fast food restaurant I've ever been to. I went in and inquired about the new spicy chicken bites they now have, I was curious what size they were, since that was going to determine how many I bought. The girl taking the orders named Kelly was MORE than helpful when answering my question, she went out of her way to walk back and bring me a sample of the chicken bites, THEN offered for me to try it. I declined since I wasn't hungry, but my husband tried it and said they were great! After seeing the size I decided to order 20 of the bites, Kelly then went back to check to see if they had enough for my order, which they didn't. She offered for us to wait while they made fresh. Of course I accepted, who wouldn't want fresh food. My husband and I took a seat to wait for our order, I observed Kelly with each customer that walked in. She was sweet, professional AND helpful with the customers orders. After a few minutes our bites were ready and we left. I will continue to KEEP coming to this location JUST because of Kelly. She went above and beyond what MOST fast food employees would, and I think that is wonderful. She was an absolute peach and made my experience at this particular location awesome. She truly made my day, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK KELLY!!!!!"}

{"text":"I was here a few days ago the night of the storm and they had issues because of the storm, I was in the drive thru and my order was totally wrong, I tried calling because I live far from this KFC, only to find out the phones were down due to the storm, I didn't call back the next day because I have a very busy/hectic life, I ended calling back 2 days later and spoke with the manager \"Ty\" who was very understanding and very apologetic, he offered to replace my food when I was in the area, I went back to this same location and My food was replaced, i was very happy with my order but more with his great customer service, and for the great customer service I will return!! And for the food of course. Not many places have good customer service anymore, i live far from this location but I am willing to drive a little further for the great service!!!"}
{"text":"As far as I know this was the first KFC in Toronto.  I've had KFC from other locations and it hasn't been as good quality as the Queensway location.  Whenever I get a craving for the stuff I come here.  They just moved to a new location a couple of blocks east after about 45 years of being at the original location.  Getting in and out of their door is better but finding a place to park is a bit harder."}
{"text":"Chicken stale wait was long with nobody in the drive thru. Quoted one price and got to the window to get another price. Asked for a receipt and the man at the window got angry with me."}
{"text":"Food is not worth the price biscuits are skinny, chicken drumsticks are just bones,  mashed potatoes or mac n cheese isnt even filled up all the way."}
{"text":"The staff was horrible here. I will drive a extra 3 miles to go to another KFC then to go to this one."}
{"text":"Coming in for a take out. We would ONLY go to Crowfoot Branch as they serve the juiciest chicken, made well-- unlike the ones found in malls. However,  service could go faster."}
{"text":"Charged 7.00 for a 5.00 meal basket because I didn't \"choose\" or want one of their special sauces on my wings.  Menu is misleading.  The \"help\" can't even give adv intelligent answer to why other than I don't know. And do not offer our ask someone for assistance...it's actually effective. He wrote me down with his lack of competency to the point of giving up or bopping some rocks in his head.  He got lucky..I left."}
{"text":"I have not been to KFC in years.  After several commercials touting the $3.99 combos I thought I would stray from my normal spots that specialize in chicken and give them another chance.

Upon ordering at the drive thru the cashier seemed distracted.  When she recapped my order she only recapped the sides not the entrees and she got the drinks wrong.

When I pulled up to the window for my total I was horrified at the full amount.  I was told the price on the menu was just for the entree that the meal was extra. 

I had to wait for about 5 minutes for my wedges to cook.

Once I got home I realized my 6 piece tender was short 3 tenders and my sides were all wrong.

I immediately called hoping that they would realize their error.  I was told I would have to come back to correct this. I offered my receipt number and I was told they just need my name and I would HAVE to come back.  

After much hemming and hawing I drove back with my receipt.  I asked for a full refund for my inconvenience and I was told that I didn't bring the food back per policy they could not refund me.  When I called I was not told I had to bring the food back.  I was told it did not matter it was clearly posted on the drive thru window.  I asked how I was supposed to bring back food that I did not receive and she said it's simply policy to teach employees what they did wrong.

The cashier admitted what she did wrong, there didn't seem to be a need to have the missing food there to correct this but the \"manager\" stuck to her policy.

I was able to get a partial refund but only after I asked for her to give me her refusal in writing as I planned to write my bank to dispute the charge after this experience.

She did not care that she was losing a customer and that I was impacting others in line with my story. 

As for the food I did receive - the chicken bites are nothing like the commercials.  They were flat, dry and bland.  

The chicken fingers were also bland.

Do yourself a favor and drive a few miles north or east to one of the other restaurants that specialize in chicken."}
{"text":"Lucky I kept my cool because of my daughter and didn't punch this guy's light out. 

Went to this location today 8/25/16 with my daughter for dinner around 4:30pm. There is one customer eating and no one at the counter but a young lady cleaning the table. So I patiently wait....about three minutes go by....still no one...about five min later, the young lady who was cleaning outside goes back inside. She seen me waiting all this time standing in front of the counter but just goes about her things and don't say anything. So after my patience run out, I ask the young lady if there's anyone to take order. She replies, \"oh, I can help you\" and not even apology. 

I order q kids meal $4.99, go cup $2.99, and a med drink $1.99. Cashier takes my card and rings my total. I look at the total and amount shows $12.99. I realized the cashier charged me two drinks and not just one. I let her know this error. She run to back and this middle eastern guy with heavy accent comes out and looks at my receipt. Don't know if he is the shift manager or the franchise owner. He says, \"oh no problem\" and not even apology and hands me two dollars in cash. Did this guys even ask me if I wanted the credit back to my card or did he not think about the tax? I though ...whatever

My order is prepared by this same guy. He calls that my order is ready. Immediately, I tell him, \"you didn't give me the apple sauce and the kids drink\". He replies, \"no more apple sauce\" and I say, \" then can you just give me extra Capri sun juice\". He gets angry and says \"I already gave you two dollar\". I am like wtf, and tell him that I order and paid for one fountain drink separately but you guys charged me for two drinks. That has nothing to do with this kids meal order which juice is included. He gets more angry and throws a empty fountain drink cup on the counter. Now, I'm getting really pissed at this guy for his angry attitude towards me and not listening to the mistakes he is making. I finally tell him by showing the receipt that I paid for kids meal and I want the juice and not a fountain drink!

He goes back and just gets one juice and say\"here you happy?\"  I'm like losing it at this point but he rushed out to the back. Customers behind me are shaking their heads and tell me why didn't just give you what you ordered. 

This is by far the most puzzling and worst customer service I've experienced in any food establishment. 
If this guys is an employee, management of this franchise better review this guy's service and demeanor when dealing with customers. This guy will cash your business away.  If this guy is the owner of this franchise, shame on him and he will never see me back here again. 

I am very sure my experience with this guy is not an isolated case but probably many with other customers. 
He really doesn't belong there."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE...
Drive thru - CASHIER NAME \"ADRIANA\"

3. Much worst forgetting to put inside the bag some of my orders. Big red flag!!!


If you don't like your job... Just QUIT.."}
{"text":"I haven't really been a huge fan of KFC, but today I thought I'd give it another shot. The drive thru was the only thing open and the person handling our had to constantly ask what it was I wanted. Even though there was only one car in front of us, the wait to get to window was about 10 minutes. When the lady started handing us our drinks, we noticed that our order was taken wrong after all that. After waiting 5 more minutes for our drinks, they then proceeds to tell us that we had to wait 5 more minutes for them to prepare the chicken. It actually turned out to be 10. The food was obviously reheated, and drinks were overfilled making them a mess to uncomfortable to touch. They also
forgot my drink. I won't  be coming back ever."}
{"text":"If I could give 0/5 stars I would. Come on KFC, get your sh*t together. Walk in at 7pm & immediately receive the \"we're about to close service.\" Wanted grilled chicken for me & tenders for my kid. 1st response we get is we don't have either. Didn't ask if we wanted to wait for some to be made fresh or anything. Just stood there like a nimrod. We were treated like absolute sh#t b/c they're trying to be off right at 10pm (advertised time to close) cleaning everything & limiting their menu. I will never come back here. & I'll give Popeyes or Canes a try next time I want some chicken. F*ck you KFC at Centennial Center."}
{"text":"Not sure why I keep coming to this KFC, maybe I'm a glutton for punishment. I always order the wings and hope for the best but what I get are the smallest and most dry wings I've ever eaten. The wings are so dry the bones almost disintegrate. The size!! Are the chickens they use miniature? They are the size of my thumb!!  It's the nearest KFC to me...I guess I can only hope one day they put a Popeyes nearby."}
{"text":"Worst location by far. Rude and incredibly slow employees who take your money and then disappear from the window for at least 10 minutes- no exaggeration- while you wonder if they were on break or are actually doing something productive back there.
Just awful."}
{"text":"So I figured out why the drive thru at this KFC takes so long...we went to go thru the drive thru and was told they would be right with us just like they always do...we waited for a few minutes and figured it would be quicker to go inside. We backed out and pulled into the parking lot. The guy that was running the drive thru was in the parking lot on a smoke break. Went inside and when we ordered they were out of almost everything. Had to wait another 15 minutes to get our food. Not worth the 40 bucks we just spent here."}
{"text":"Tiny and dry as a bone...i just picked up a two piece classic meal, thigh and drumstick, for my wife.  Opened the box when I got home and thought \"That is one skinny looking leg and they gave me a wing piece instead of a thigh\". Turns out...it was a thigh, just from a baby bird or a sickly bird. I wish i knew how to post a picture on yelp. Both the thigh and drumstick fit very easily, with lots of room leftover, in my very normally sized hand, my hand  looks  Shaq sized holding those two pieces!  The drumstick looked to have had most of its meat stripped and was so hard and dry I wondered if it was from last week. Popeyes isn't as close, but we've given this KFC multiple passes for many reasons stated in other reviews.  Time to move on."}
{"text":"Worst KFC location ever don't ever go here never have anything ready I would have to wait for chicken always have to wait for wings worst service ever you want good chicken go to canes anywhere but KFC at this location OK I went to KFC same location tried to give him a second chance went there for dinner on 6/16/16 and they had no chicken what kind of restaurant is this I have given up on KfcI guess I'll have to start going to churches chicken. p.S went there at 4:30 pm this should be dinner hour and still they had no chicken ready all they had was wings unbelievable I am done with you KFC sorry I actually wish you had zero stars that's  The rating I would give them"}
{"text":"Worst KFC I've been to. Given it a chance several different times always disappointed. Chicken so  mushy greasy. SUCKS! Tried to give us a free replacement dinner I didn't even want it. Unless I could use at another location."}
{"text":"This place is filthy and has had very low sanitation scores for years! I dont know how they are allowed to stay open. Mold all over the building,  doors dont close right, it was raining when I was there and the roof was leaking like a waterfall all down the wall with water pooled in the floor and they werent even cleaning it up!! They need to tear this place down asap before somebody gets sick!"}
{"text":"So I went to this KFC as a quick backup plan bc the sandwich shop is closed on Sunday's next door.   I asked for extra sauce when ordering at the window. I was informed they are $.27 per.   I asked for two and then they didn't even put them in the sack.    So, this kfc owes me $.54 

The chicken littles were as expected"}
{"text":"They should stick with chicken! Had chicken  fried steak tough and dry
 kinda like  a hockey puck, wont order that again!"}
{"text":"Worst KFC ever. Food sucks .. Undercooked ... Will not change mash potatoes for wedges or potatoes for Cole slaw or charge $1.99 for the exchange!!! Only Ofc in the country that does this. I was told by the employees the owner is a \"cheap bast***\" and calculates that Cole slaw costs the biz 33 cents and the mashed potatoes 28 cents. Worst KFC ever. Place is empty due to poor customer service and the cheap owner. Never again"}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying, I give 5 stars for the employees and how well they executed but please remember that it's still KFC.

 There was a new employee being trained by another and I was completely blown away! I was originally going to get my food to go but wanted to see if the service from this trainer was consistent. I sat around the corner to be out of site & out of mind. This was true for the rest of the staff as they eventually got loud and seemed like they forgot there was a guest in the restaurant. The trainer was on top of things and even notified the drive thru worker whenever someone pulled up. 

Training is the time to be over-the-top and he did phenomenal. Great job!!!"}
{"text":"Good mashed potatoes and gravy. Decent Cole slaw. As for the chicken the secret spices and herbs were no where. I'm old and remember how tasty it was. The colonel has to be spinning in his grave. Makes you appreciate mr. chicken."}
{"text":"March 7, 2017 9:15PM... the food i ordered was OLD and HARD. They even tried to fool me by cutting up a chicken tender to fill up a large Popcorn Chicken Box I ordered. Should've just been HONEST with me and say they were out of popcorn chicken, instead of having me pay $5.50 for one cut up chicken tender. HORRIBLE. The biscuit they gave me was hard like a rock too."}
{"text":"It was the first time I ever came to this location, and not gonna lie, it smelled like sewer! Bad day, perhaps? But oh well, it's KFC and I love me some fried chicken."}
{"text":"We've had more than one bad experience at this KFC but this last time was the last time. Not only for this location but for KFC altogether. I bought an 8 piece meal that was supposed to include 2 breasts instead it had 5 thighs, unacceptable. To top it off, my wife used to like the pot pies, they changed the recipe and now the sauce is disgusting, I wouldn't even it and I'm not really a picky eater. I'm assuming those are frozen so can't really blame the location if indeed they are so it's a corporate decision. Maybe pay attention to the food and not to producing the oh so hilarious commercials."}
{"text":"So for a fast food chain place this was probably one the most pleasant. Latoya was her name i believe she was very nice and had a personality. Most fast food places it's get in get out, i came in here and was greeted with a genuine smile and happy demeanor. I used to work in fast food and i know the how bad the bad days can be and really appreciate those who can be so happy working in a field like this. 

My food was warm and no complaints. She gave me a cookie for the wait which I didn't feel was very long at all really. The sentiment was nice and appreciated. 

I ate and left back to work in a small amount of time, my meal was great, and reasonably priced so I have no complaints. Will be returning when I have a short lunch. Thanks!"}
{"text":"This KFC/Taco Bell sucks! The food is NEVER fresh, the wait is never less than 10 minutes in the drive thru, and they never give you silverware and napkins in your bag! Even after the building was remodeled, the quality of food and service has not gotten better! Thumbs down KFC and Taco Bell and zero stars! Such a shame, this is a nice area but this place needs new management."}

p.s - their cooks obviously dont know what they are doing because isnt chicken their main dish??? WTF"}
{"text":"We went through the drive thru, waiting 10min to order. Legs and thighs special. They didn't ask if we wanted original or crispy, told us we couldn't substitute mashed potatoes for coleslaw.
After telling her our coupon said we could substitute, she agreed to. The chicken was the worst I have ever had there. We have been going there since it opened, and each year it has gone down hill. The chicken tasted like it was made yesterday. It was so dried up and overdone. We haven't been for awhile since I have been ill. I was so looking forward to the great chicken that usually is kfc. I was so disgusted. I guess I will have to go to Popeyes from now on."}
{"text":"I went through the drive through. I ordered the 2 piece extra crispy meal with mac and cheese and mashed potatoes with gravy. I asked for 2 legs   Once getting to work I saw I did not get a second leg and it was not extra crispy. It was original and was extremely creative the bottom of the box was coated in grease. The mac and cheese was not all that great but the mashed potatoes were great. I see why this place received one star. I went at 2:30 during the week and there was no one before me."}
{"text":"I haven't been at the location on eastern near horizon ridge for awhile. I was starved and unable to cook so I thought I'd try it again and I was repulsed to see the chicken legs were the size of Cornish hen legs and the thighs were like half the size. They were overcooked ofcourse because they cook them just as long as when they were normal as chicken parts. It was twenty dollars in the trash. Unappetizing, and they must have traveled far to find chickens that small. The real colonel would never have wanted it to be such low quality. I couldve walked into smiths and got a prime rib for 25.00. Chicken for twenty, people won't go. It wasn't crowded there.  Never again. Grocery stores don't do that. If I had company I wouldve been embarrassed. I was just left famished. Sorry KFC. I gave you one star for your sides. Still good and untouched but the chicken is your main attraction!"}
{"text":"Rude staff. 
Fast service. 
Taco Bell is very greasy and just thrown together. For 2 menu items I did receive 23 (yes I counted them) packets of mild sauce. So I would say generous describes them as well. 
KFC has great food and well, you can't really mess that up can you."}
{"text":"Fuck this place and their lack of white chicken and corn. The least they could do was substitute tenders in place of breast. The manager said no and acted like that was his own personal chicken and being greedy about it. Only reason I gave them 1 star is because I had to. They lost a sale and customer for being cheap."}
{"text":"If you want to enter a restaurant and  be delighted with the aroma  of  fresh good smelling food being cooked. Don't go here. 
The place stunk, the floors and tables were dirty. 
There wasn't any other costumers In the place, I should have gotten a clue.
 We got a bucket of chicken, took it home but I was so grossed out by the restaurant I didn't even really want to eat it. ( ate 1 small chicken leg )
I won't be making this mistake again. We  got crap for dinner for $23.00 bucks.
Total waste of $$$$"}
{"text":"This KFC sucks. They screwed up my order. The biscuits were hard, the chicken was dry, and one of the sides was cold even before I left the restaurant. I had to ask for my change back rather than be offered. The employee was rude."}
{"text":"It's Friday night at 5:30 and I ordered an eight piece of extra crispy. I was told it would take twenty minutes. I left."}
{"text":"The food here is typical KFC. But DO NoT expect to get what you ordered. I've been here at least 5 times in the last 3 months, and the service gets worse each time I come in. Today I was the 3rd in line, finally after about 4 mins a employee dude comes in the door fully dressed in uniform with a headset on. He meanders to the counter to take an order, fills it slowly and then disappears. While this is happening employee girl comes in this half her clothes in her hands... i didn't think much of that until now. Dang... was dude and gal really in the lot.  Oh God maybe that's why the couple in front of me actually left. They were saying the one another how horrible the service was and commented that one of the girls was in the back eating chicken.
Finally my turn.... employee #3 comes out of nowhere now with headset on and looks for 1 and 2 kinda shrugs and says well I guess I can help you.
What a zoo!
I got my order correct today only because I reminded #3 to give me grilled as she reached for extra crispy. Sigh. To top it all off when i opened my potatoes it was over filled with more gravy than potatoes and it got all over my shirt and ruined it.
Bottom line... don't bother going here unless you really hate Taco Bell and McDonald's and its the only choice left at this exit. Better yet... the food at BP would probably be better and safer to eat. At least you know for sure you won't have nasty \"car hands\" making your food from employees doing God knows what in the parking lot."}
{"text":"Second time in a row they messed up our order. I shouldn't have to rip everything out of a bag to make sure you got out order right. Girl taking order didn't repeat order either. We specified two times about our order and still got it wrong. Gave us no straws... we were supposed to get mashed potatoes instead of fries but didn't. Supposed to get a large mac n cheese gave us a dinky 2 bite portion not sure why they even have portions that small. And idk if they charged us for it as a large. But really why would i order fricken two bites of mac n cheese!?"}
{"text":"Very bad service, employees have horrible attitudes and they never have items such as chicken potpies I would recommend you never go there"}
{"text":"This store is stingy with their legs and thighs.  I ordered the $10 bucket and asked for legs and thighs.  She told me \"I'm sorry I can't do that\".  Well it clearly says \"MIX IT YOUR WAY\" on the menu.  Avoid this location!!!  It won't let me post without a star rating so I'll give it one but it deserves nothing!"}
{"text":"KFC as a whole is just not worth the money. This store sells you overcooked hours old chicken to boot. Frys has better chicken. So sad."}
{"text":"We used this location of KFC to order 110 of the $5 fill ups.  They were easy to work with, the order was hot and ready just a few minutes later than we asked for it to be ready.  They were great to work with.  110 teenagers were very happy!!"}
{"text":"AVOID, terrible customer service, took the family through the drive thru and when we got home had the complete wrong order.  I know, I should have checked the order but we were the only people there, LOL, which makes it that much worse!!!!!"}
{"text":"They have a real problem getting orders right.  Son ordered a big box meal, supposed to have three chicken tenders and nuggets. No tenders, but a thigh instead. No one said a word about the substitution. Also had no unsweetened tea. Previous time order was supposed to have potato wedges instead of mashed potatoes, got mashed. Husband ordered an extra side of coleslaw, never got it.This store has not been open very long, but they have a major problem getting their orders right."}
{"text":"It's 7:45 pm on August 7th... ordered original recipe and of course this triggers a 12 minute wait because they have no chicken. This location is always dreadful and why I come here is beyond me..,NEVER AGAIN KFC"}
{"text":"i gave one star because yelp does not give the option for a negative rating. this kfc not only has really bad service, but the chicken is really greasy and the grease must not have been changed in months. kfc is known for \"original recipe\",  but this place is always out. this time they shorted biscuits,  last time it was mac and cheese. they should have closed this one and left the one on 105th and indian school opened. i hope someone from corporate kfc will visit this store. i will never go here again, i'll eat a bologna sandwich instead."}
{"text":"This is Possibly the worst KFC in las vegas,.. Been here a few times thinking it was just a bad day for them but no.. Stay away from here if you want KFC..  Cold food stale biscuits and a girl that's been smoking weed or on some kind of medication at the register.."}
{"text":"Of all the KFC locations in the area, this is the one with the most issues.

Avoid the drive-thru.... you'll never leave with your correct entire order
Avoid asking for the Colonel Specials as they have no idea about the insider deals
Don't let them take your credit card to swipe the interac/credit machine.... my credit got cloned here and what a mess to fix up."}
{"text":"Stopped with my daughter for the first time in over a year. I will not return.  There were no correct orders coming out. The food was tasteless and no one had a clue."}
{"text":"I do not know how this place stays in business.  Drive thru orders are never right and service is just bad.  I mean real bad.  I can only guess that it has to stem from management because the service is bad no matter what day you go there."}
{"text":"Who doesn't give out napkins at the drive thru?? Every single time I've gone through the drive thru no napkins. Plus the customer service sucks so bad!! I had to repeat my order 3 times before he understood then still didn't remember what kind of drink and asked me when I pulled up to the window. I'll be driving east to the one on Bell and 40th St from now on."}
{"text":"Angie (working the drive-thru) was short and very monotone with her responses. It seemed like she would have rather been anywhere but at work. When ordering our food, she would say \"what else?\" In a very short, rude tone of voice."}
{"text":"Arrived for 1 small side item and a drink this evening, checked my bag as I drove away and it was the wrong item. Went back through the drive-thru and the employee Jay thought it was funny and wanted to argue claiming he gave me the item I ordered. Came back with a bag of the SAME wrong item! Again, he thought this was funny and my patience was running thin. Two other employees were standing there immaturely laughing along with Jay as they walked behind a wall. Jay finally gave me my correct food and said, \"see it's what you ordered.\" Horrible service, granted it's a fast food restaurant so what should I expect; however, I expect semi-quality service. I am a manager myself and based on my incident along with the similar other incident reviews, I would clean house and fire the staff members because clearly they don't deserve a pay check for their horrible service."}
{"text":"I visit this location last night. I didnt see any problems. The lobby was clean with xmas music playing and xmas decor everywhere. It was pretty nice. The manager was very nice. She wished us happy holidays before leaving the establishment. When we got home the food was awesome. Original hot and fresh. I rate this establishment a five star. I could see why ppl would rate this store low, its because of the area. There is a bunch of homeless and weridos. The employees were nice, the food was excellent!"}
{"text":"I totally recommend  to not go to this location of KFC, my boyfriend just recently bought a large size of mashed potatoes a few days ago and found a huge rusted nail in it... we didn't realize it until we got home and was about to eat dinner. Please please please look at what you're eating, because this is totally unacceptable"}
{"text":"This has to be the dirtiest, grimiest, slimiest, restaurant ever. Grimmie floors, dirty walls, this spot is disgusting - like I made a right turn from Carowinds Blvd into a KFC in Bangladesh. But how about..... There was an \"A\" rating on the door????

The owner should be shot. Or at least slapped really hard!"}
{"text":"I love this store I came here after church with a few people, this place always has the most amazing employees everyone is always smiling and happy to help. Michelle is such an amazing GM I can totally see the difference once she took over! So clean and the food is great! Highly suggest it!"}
{"text":"Took 30 minutes of waiting in line and 30 minutes of waiting for it to cook and that forgot my food worse KFC I ever been too"}
{"text":"I don't expect too much out of KFC, but wow is this place a mess. Drive through said to order then talked to someone else. Someone was asking for change at the drive through. Then all my food was mangled and had some brown lettuce on it. Gross! This place is convenient but it has seemed poorly managed on almost every visit."}
{"text":"Very frustrating that every single time we've come here to this location there hasn't been a time that I haven't had something missing. We just went and didn't even get a big order and had a couple items missing."}
{"text":"Very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very 
Very good food good poppies & popcorn chin eon"}
{"text":"Every prisoner on death row can request one final meal before his or her execution date. The condemned can ask for any spread if it doesn't contain alcohol. According to an interesting statistic I recently came across, the most popular request in American prisons has always been food from Kentucky Fried Chicken. If I were about to meet my maker, via electric chair, lethal injection, or firing squad my last request might also be KFC. If it were truly my final meal I wouldn't have to worry about calories, cholesterol, or heart disease; I would want to make sure my last dinner was delicious and denounced by cardiologist worldwide.

Alas, my eating habits are determined by my metabolism. When I eat Kentucky Fried Chicken I must do so sparingly and deal with the consequences. While I don't get to KFC that often anymore, I savor the unhealthy food just like I imagine a death row inmate might.

I do miss Kentucky Fried Chicken's Little Bucket Parfaits. The discontinued Chocolate Crème Parfait was just about the best dessert I've ever had. I must deduct one star from my overall rating because no meal at KFC is complete without a Parfait. Bring back the Little Buckets!"}
{"text":"Same story at this location over and over.  Out of chicken almost two hours prior to closing time and no plan to make more. Manager explained the owner has them stop making fresh chicken at 7pm when they don't close until 11pm.  Trying to cut costs I am sure.   They probably figure they are only losing a few orders late at night.  But I will not return as I am sure many are doing the same.  Sad way to run a business."}
{"text":"I really do try to shy away from giving bad reviews but this place is just horrible! I've tried this location 3 times in the last year and it was a horrible disappointment each time. Badly dried out chicken from sitting under the heat lamps way too long, failing to mention that they are out of gravy until you come back to complain that you didn't receive any with your order, and the most annoying drive thru window in the valley! I hate sounding like a redneck bigot but the young lady taking orders from the drive thru should be required to speak at least a little English! I have no interest in learning how to speak Spanish just so my order is correct from KFC and I don't have to repeat my order several times before she just resorts to guessing what the hell I want and throwing it in a bag!"}
{"text":"So for my uncles 111th birthday we were going to have a huge party. Half the city was invited. We also hired a magician who was a firework expert. We had KFC cater for us and it was a hit. Everyone loved it and got so drunk and it was a great time. My uncle disappeared during the night and we can only assume the worst. But we know that this was one of his favorite nights when he said beforehand, Freda 
this will be a night to remember. 
I always remember what he said to me, 
\"It's dangerous business walking out your front door, take one step wrong and all of a sudden it's a world of adventure.\""}
{"text":"So, to be fair, the food was fine and the service was friendly. However, there wasn't a clean table in the restaurant. I've never been in a restaurant where I didn't feel comfortable setting my belongings on the floor or the tables, but the place was straight-up dirty. Between the retro photos on the wall, fluorescent lighting, and dated tri-color decor, this KFC doesn't look like it's been renovated since 1984."}
{"text":"The staff closed the lobby earlier than they were supposed to on Christmas Eve. It was posted that they would be closing early because of the holiday but they closed it an hour earlier then the new time. We then went through the drive through and they told us they were out of chicken, if we wanted to wait 15 minutes they could sell us 8 pieces because they said they had other customers waiting but weirdly enough the parking lot was empty."}
{"text":"Raw biscuit. Asked for a mixed family piece ended up with all legs and one breast. Called to complain about the order since it was too far to go back and no one answers. This isn't the first time I've gotten a bad order from here. Even when you go inside to complain the workers are more busy in the back on their phones. Never come to this kfc, wrong order poor service and these bastards manage to run out of chicken at 5pm."}
{"text":"Be very careful since there seem to be a few aggressive people by the doors outside, asking for your food as you are leaving. The management should be aware this is a major problem when the begger is large and assertive."}
{"text":"Very rude staff, very slow service.. Needless to say, I am never coming back. The guy at the register actually yelled at this old man and when the old man left the employees were laughing about it and making fun of the poor old man. I guess they think losing business is funny"}
{"text":"So my husband and I ate here last night and we left totally disappointed.  We both ordered the $5 fill up 3 piece chicken tenders meal because we both were so excited to try their new flg sauce. When we got our meals the chicken tenders weren't even warm, they were cold and  tasted like they have been sitting done for hours. :(  and that wasn't the only thing not warm the biscuit same thing) . The mash potatoes were just ok and the cookie ok. Service could have been better. However overall it was one of the worest experiences We have had at fast food restaurant and we will not be returning. What s shame!!!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin with this Dumpster Fire Piece of Sh!t place??

First of all, the order taker/cashier was RUDE AS HELL to the elderly couple in front of me. The older gentleman was having a problem inserting his CC into the chip reader. The cashier told him to \"swipe it\". The gentleman, not hearing him still tried to insert the card. The cashier told him \"I told you to swipe it\". I was like wow, how rude. He was then RUDE to me as well. I told him I wanted the Chicken Little and Potato Wedges \"FRESH\". He rolled his eyes and said \"fine\". He then threw my change on the counter and walked away. I had to ask someone else for my cup as he didn't give me one. I left, absolutely disgusted. The food, was not fresh and tasted like it had been sitting for hours. I was so pissed at this point, I knew it would not end well if I walked back into the store to complain. I simply threw it away. I will NOT be back!"}
{"text":"Not to bad. Good chicken and fast service. People are friendly to. Not as good as Popeyes but ok."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for 8 years and have never experienced such terrible customer service anywhere. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and while I really like the vintage look and feel, the service and chicken are not up to par. On one visit the woman while taking my order realized she forgot to give the person ahead of me their medium salad. She had it in bag under her hand. Ppl make mistakes but it was her look and chuckle of \"oh well\" when she told me that really sucks. Shows how little she cared. Second time when I ordered a favorite bucket, all my popcorn chicken were burnt. If you are making this all day how could you not notice the chicken is a different colour and dried out?!   To serve it again shows how little they care. Im going to markville from now on for kfc in Thai area. Yes, I'd rather go into a mall than order here again!"}
{"text":"Arrived there at 8:40pm the time recorded on the receipt was 8:41pm.... The order requested was 20 piece extra crispy tenders, Large Mashed and gravy, Large Corn on the cob, etc. Can you please pull forward we need to cook fresh chicken for you. Was told 10 minutes, 26 minutes later a gentleman comes out and says; \"the corn looks weird can we substitute it for something else?\" We went with potato wedges for my son. Another 7 minutes go by and he comes back out with our order... When we arrive home it consisted of; 22 piece tenders, biscuits, macaroni and cheese, and a small order of wedges. For the wait he threw in 3 cookies. Are you freaking kidding me? Did I mention they left off the tea as well? When I tried the phone number 4 times no one answered!!!! Complete failure"}
{"text":"This is the worst kfc I have aver been to! They never get an order right! Had to go through Drive thru twice tonight to get coleslaw instead of mash potatoes only to come home and find they gave me a leg and a wing when I ordered a wing and a thigh!!! I will go out of my to another kfc or go to El Polo Loca which is closer! Try calling this store; there number is disconnected!!!!:(((("}
{"text":"Friendly staff! Fast service at drive thru but also fast service in the lobby. When eating at the lobby it's nicely always clean and supplies filled ."}
{"text":"I give a zero star rating. I live right around the corner from this KFC. I love fresh KFC, especially the sauce-less hot wings and the grilled chicken. UNFORTUNATELY, More often than not, I end up leaving without placing an order. The reason I leave is almost always the same. Either there is literally no chicken prepared or there isn't any of whichever kind I have ordered. This is frustrating because I have complained directly to the shift manager before, and I have heard others do the same. I keep going back hoping for a better experience. Dumb me! Today I left both because they did not have the type of chicken I wanted (apparently the new thing is a 9.5 minute wait if you want the wings, so I ordered grilled chicken instead and they were out), and the girl working the drive-through was a smart ass."}
{"text":"Such a bad experience. I went in at around 9:20pm. The lobby closes at 10:00pm. As soon as I start walking through the door I can already see the employees faces drop as they dread taking my order. I walk up to the front to look at the menu and I hear the workers start asking each other who wants to handle me. They keep going back and forth until one finally decides on helping me. After that I start to say my order but since they were trying to hurry up and close, they closed down the front end register. The boy who took my order stood there and didn't even write it down or anything and of course got my order wrong.  Their expressions and attitudes were so irritating. The whole time I felt I welcomed and rushed. They shouldn't be trying to shut down even when there is 40 minutes to close. If they don't want to work then they shouldn't have gotten a job."}
{"text":"Went to the location on elliot and val vista. Was told they didn't have a 16pc. Available and I would have to wait 35 mins. So looked up the next closest location. Baseline and gilbert. Called to make sure they had chicken available. Angel answered the phone. Not only did he have chicken available, he offered to get my order ready. Since I was already on my way and was at the location in 5 mins. My order was ready. Plus I got an apology for the other location mishap. Great service. Fast. And awesome staff. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Bad customer service. Dirty restrooms. Dirty dining area. And from the looks of it dirty kitchen!!!! Food came out cold and even though my order was small they still managed to screw it up."}
{"text":"I wouldn't have wasted my time writing this review if I wasn't stuck in this very drive thru like I have been for the last 15 minutes. With a busy line of 3 cars and the fact that after 15 minutes she had to re- take my order because they clearly couldn't handle the task of ordering one chicken wrap. I'll never waste my lunch here again and I think it's also important I note the absence of any kind of customer service or appropriate people skills but what could you expect."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this location.  I went through the drive thru and ordered Pot Pie, I was told takes 20-mins, so I agreed to park and wait  inside.  20-mins later I asked if my order was ready,  again at 25 and 30 mins.  My order was finsally handed to me 35-mins later.  I am not going back to this location."}
{"text":"Seriously!!! Charging 75 cents for a cup of water. I spend so much on food at this location and you nickel and dime me for a cup of water. If you going to charge for a cup, it needs to be put on the menu or at least tell the customer before you charge them. I go to this KFC 3 times a week, but this is the last straw. I will not go back. Lot of new chicken location with larger portions to choose from. I'm only choosing 1 star because i can't go any lower."}
{"text":"Don't go to this KFC. They ignore you and make you wait (even if there is no one else inside or out in the drive thru), and they don't accept responsibility with their complaints. Most of their staff is poorly trained and need better social interaction skills. Go to another KFC. Or better yet, keep driving down and go to In N Out or Cane's instead."}
{"text":"The floors are sticky, the food is not fresh.
We waited almost 20 minutes for a carry out order that consisted of two 2 piece meals and 2 large sides and 4 biscuits. The biscuits were hard as rocks and stale, the cold slaw was not fresh and was completely dry, just shredded cabbage in a cup. One of the 2 piece meals was packed up wrong, dark meat was ordered and white meat was given. The staff was completely unprepared and had no urgency in getting orders completed.
This place has been nixed for a lunch stop during the work week."}
{"text":"Sitting in the drive thru now - 10 minute wait while I'm the only car. Ben is extremely rude - then proceeds to hand me the wrong order. Great job KFC."}
{"text":"Worst KFC ever! My chicken basket had 3 pieces of very old tired chicken. Barley any meat on the bones. The hot wings weren't even hot. They were the size of a baby chicken. Returned the corn as it was grey, smelled spoiled and tasted spoiled. Also returned the hard biscuit. The only good sides were the cole slaw and mashed taters. The mac and cheese has horrible over cooked noodles in a pasty cheese stuff. The place was empty and it was dinner time. Next door at McDonald's it was packed. It's no wonder as KFC is now the worst chicken joint around. Stay away from this location...or all locations."}
{"text":"Go to another location if possible.  I have actually been going to this location for several years and they frequently do not have what you order.  You will have to wait up to 30 minutes sometimes.  Our most recent visit we ordered the special of 10 Hot Wings and some other items.  They said the wait would be about 15 minutes for the wings.  Takes like 4 minutes to cook in a deep fryer.  We agreed to wait.  About 15 minutes later the drive through attendant came out empty handed.  He told us while waiting on the wings some of the other food we ordered was sold to someone else.  He compensated us with a few extra wings.  When we arrived home we realized they shorted us a Chicken Tender.  We will go ahead and drive the extra 2 miles to try another KFC.  Some of the staff is friendly and some would rather see you walk away I believe.  Ignoring you when you come in.  When you do get food it is usually very good."}
{"text":"First the drink that they served to me through the drive-thru had soda all over the sides and bubbling up through the lid. The cashier thought it was hilarious and told me to be careful. Then she told me to go park and that it was going to be about 10 minutes. I said okay  and please bring lots of hot sauce with my order . When the food finally came out exactly ten minutes later,  there was no hot sauce , and they said why didn't you ask for any . Once again terrible customer service!"}
{"text":"This location was the reason I stopped eating KFC.
6 years ago I have been three time in the last 2 months... Every time they have been out of something I would of liked to order. Drive threw takes too long/ food sucks"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. I said at drive thru for 10onutes before someone finally greatest me.  Then there was 2 different ppl on the speaker and they kept confusing themselves. Then before I was done they had me pull up I tried to add something and they told me NO I couldn't add anything and it was to late.  What kinda costumer service is that.  Bullshit place to go. Beware and go out of your way somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"I went inside today to order to go. It was about 4:15. The girl at the counter took my order and then 3 more orders behind me. I wondered why it was taking so long to get my order but realized that the girl that took our orders also went back to bag them up. The chicken wasn't even hot. The legs looked like they were made for toddlers! The chicken legs and thighs were old. Tasted like they sat too long in the heated cabinet. The only good thing was the coleslaw. Lets just say that KFC has gone downhill over the years."}
{"text":"I ordered 3 pieces of chicken, biscuit, green beans, and corns. I noticed I only got chickens and a biscuit when I got home...Seriously !!!!???? I should have checked...I guess.... Im sooooo disappointed!!!!!"}
{"text":"Need to go thru drive thru to get good service.
FOOD IS GOOOOOOOD!!!!!
Needs better service inside tho."}
{"text":"Rude, uncaring, and extremely unwelcoming. 100 thumbs down. I walked in. No one acknowledged me for about 2 minutes. The first girl to make eye contact with me stared at me, said nothing, threw some food in a bag and then walked towards the drive thru."}
{"text":"I live near this location, & i usually stop by it once per month.& every time I do so,i have to wait at least 5mins to get my order taken plus in between 7 to 10mins to get my food,wether is to eat in or take out,i think they need wither to hire more employees or the management just needs to improve & will reflect on their service.for now be prepared to wait & wait . think twice b4 going inn"}
{"text":"Ordered a family meal and added two large macaroni. Did not receive either macaroni sides and could not reach the manager to let them know. In a rush and was not able to return for the 8 dollars I spent on macaroni!  Not at all happy with the store!"}
{"text":"Cashier appeared to be handling food without gloves then would handle cash then return to food without washing. Not sanitary."}
{"text":"I don't know how anyone can eat this stuff KFC should just close their doors. Everything is so processed and flavorless it makes you wanna vomit. The macaroni and cheese was all gelatinous and chunky not creamy at all and just tasted weird. The chicken strips look like they come out of a freezer and are just reheated which they probably are. The mashed potatoes are most likely potato flakes which have no flavor what so ever. Don't eat here people just make homemade fried chicken and mashed potatoes it would taste 100 times better and it would take the same amount of time to cook as it would for you to leave your house and buy this trash."}
{"text":"I ordered through drive thru and I was extremely disappointed with their service. I was just craving some good chicken and I didn't even get that. We got the big box and two $5 fill ups. They cramped all the boxes in a really small bag. Two boxes were upside down. When we got to the park, I found out that they did not put any condiments or even just napkins. I'm actually surprised that even remembered to include sporks and straws. I should've known better to check if everything was in the bag before driving off but I shouldn't have to ask for basic drive thru basics. The chicken was extremely soggy. You could tell that they did not drain the excess oil from the chicken. I got a lemonade and it tasted like water. I hope that they improve their service. Perhaps a new management is needed."}
{"text":"Was so excited that KFC was coming to Indian Land, SC. Have been to this one 3 times. It's been packed everytime I have gone. The last visit was disappointing and it will be a while before I go back. My husband got the $7.95 buffet and I got a $3.99 nugget meal. We both shared our meals with our 15 month old grandson. I asked my husband to get a couple of specific things off the buffet to feed our grandson. This was overheard by a older looking KFC employee who was cleaning up the dining room. Sorry I did not get his name or I would post it on here. He proceeded to \"alert\" another employee as to \"what I was doing\" and asked them to \"watch me\". I guess he thinks I was \"sharing\" off my husbands buffet. I did finish my meal first, so he could have thought this. I would gladly have shown him our receipt to show him I was not mooching. When I do decide to go back, I will be announcing to the cashier that I will be feeding my grandson off my plate and if they have a problem, I can leave. I suspect they will be posting a \"No Sharing\" sign in the next few weeks if not days."}
{"text":"This is the worst food, first of all KFC is the most expensive brand out of all of the fried chicken industry. I drove out of my way to get this chicken only to bring my family old dried chicken. I ordered original and they gave my crispy, the wedges where dry and old and the biscuits where hard, I called the location and told them about my horrible order spoke with the manager Angela and her only solution was to bring the food back and get a refund, so now I have to drive out of my way again to return this horrible food to get my money back.  This place gives KFC brand a bad name"}
{"text":"We are those who knows exactly what we want before we even pull in so our order is extremely quick. The same guy is always in the intercom(may be the manager), and is always so rude when we come thru the drive thru. It never fails. He has a nasty attitude when you come to the window. Doesn't tell you price. Just takes your money, gives you change, and slams the window in your face. I would NEEEEEEVER RECOMMEND THIS KFC. I'm actually surprised it's still in business. TUH.....They better be glad their biscuits are so good, and my son enjoys their nasty cold potato wedges."}
{"text":"Yeah, Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) just doesn't taste the same as it did as a kid and we all know why... Crappy quality of ingredients and hormone stuffed poultry!

But I gave this KFC location 1-star due to the fact that they stole $0.39 from me. Sure what's thirty-nine cents you ask... Nothing, other than the fact that it was taken from me without my permission.

They have two signs that clearly read: \"Additional fee of $0.39 will be added for debit card use.\" - or something to that effect. So I cleverly used my credit card... Only to find the fee had been added to that too.

So... here's to you, you piece of crap franchise owner who feels that it's necessary to make a profit from patrons wanting to use plastic, instead of eating the expense (which we all know is much less than $0.39 per transaction) like every other restaurant and business across the country does.

I think I'll go through your drive-thru a couple of times a month, order $40 to $50 dollars worth of food, then refuse to accept the food if I'm forced to pay an \"inconvenience\" fee when I hand them my debit/credit card. The thought of your KFC location having to regularly waste money by throwing out a $50 order here and there ought to make me feel better about your theft from me!

I hope others follow suit until you start acting right!"}
{"text":"No wonder this sore only has 2 reviews!!! Hey KFC owners, when you have a manger that's always a B***h toward YOUR (owners) customers it's going to cost you money.  I told my wife to get 3x mac and cheese and the manager really rude says we don't do that for no one. Like seriously she lucky I wasn't there I don't like rude people no reason for attitude. 


HEY MANAGER IF YOU HATE YOUR JOB THAN QUITE!!!!

Your just a number there, you can be replaced by anyone
Someone who really wants that position and will deal with upset customers with a smile on their face. Not act the way you did.  

Also if I could leave zero stars I would

WILL NEVER BE BACK, EVER!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is HORRIBLE. Ordered an 8-piece bucket, came home and there were 4 overcooked tiny drumsticks & 4 tiny thighs. Gross. No breasts, no wings. Called the store, the nice lady who picked up the phone said there should have been 2 breasts, 2 wings, 2 thighs, 2 drumsticks. She says, \"let me get my manager to help you get what you ordered.\" Some jerk with an attitude gets on the phone and says, \"we've been out of breasts and wings for 3 hours now and we're telling everyone that\". I said, no one told me that, Or I would have went somewhere else. All he says is, \"Well they should have told you.\"  1.  Why are they not telling people this when you order and 2.  Why are they charging the same price?  Ridiculous. Never go here. Manager is a jerk and food is horrible."}
{"text":"Lack of urgency for getting orders out.  I've gone 3 times and each time they were out of something.  It was 3 strikes and you're out."}
{"text":"Bought bucket of chicken for to go and very very disappointed! Skin is so dark brown, oil must be reused many times. Therefore didn't taste good. Meat inside is dry. Ordered potato wedges and they're very chewy. Mash potatoes needs to be cooked some more. I honestly felt like I wasted my money here. 

Never ever coming back"}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst KFC I've ever been to.  My wife found a thick, black hair in her cole slaw.  She was the only person who opened it and ate any. She has thin red hair.

She called the KFC manager and the first words out of her mouth were \"NO ONE HERE HAS BLACK CURLY HAIR!\"  The hair wasn't \"curly\", it was just sort of wavy.

This so-called \"manager\" refused to do anything unless my wife personally brought the hair back to the store!

Not to worry...we love KFC, but we will not be going back to this flthy store with the rude manager for any reason! If this is a company-owned store, KFC is falling down on the job by having staff like this."}
{"text":"I ordered the 20 piece meal which was an option on door dash  for our baseball team staying at a local hotel.   When the Door Dash person got to KFC this location, they told her that item needed a coupon.   Why would you list it as a door dash item to choose
From and not mention you need a coupon.    How is the poor door dash delivery person supposed to respond?    Luckily, she was smart enough to call me and I asked them to tell me where the coupon can be found.    What do you know, they produced one for her.   This whole process delayed the order
By an entire hour.    What did KFC gain by doing all that?"}
{"text":"Went again today after a while. Second time coming in the past two weeks. First visit was fine, other than they forgot to put sauce in the bag 

Second visit the cashier got the order wrong then blamed me. Luckily I checked the bag before I left. Also forgot the sauce again."}
{"text":"Went to drive through asking if they have 8 piece dark meat. They told me they don't sell it. What kind of chicken serving restaurant doesn't sell chicken."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this KFC.  Today they were out of thighs so the offered to substitute drums instead.  They refused to substitute more or breasts without upcharging.  They don't mind shorting you with small cuts but they don't understand customer service.  Also the $5 meals That KFC advertises are $5.75 here.  Count on their prices being 15% higher than others.  I have never had good service here.  I wish there was another one closer.  Going to start driving to a farther one from now on."}
{"text":"I would give this store a -5, if i could. This fucking KFC is ghetto as fuck. Number 1 they have a phone number that doesn't even work. According to the so call manager who wasn't even a manager said their phone line has been down for a year. Dumb ass why have a phone number on Google if your line doesn't work. KFC can't even afford a phone line, wow. Thats hood. Then they refused to replace my order after I told them what was wrong with my order. They had placed my Cole slaw on top of my potatoes which made it nasty and warm. Then they didn't give me my crispy chicken. They also never gave us our cookies, nor did they give me my al carta jalapeño. Very very horrible service. Will never recommend this KFC to anyone. Google rating is 2.6  how sad is that."}
{"text":"Been going there for years , but every year that goes by it gets worse. Maybe KFC don't really care who works there, or how and why they cook there. This last time felt like eating Chicken , it was dirty, we had to clean our tables like if Pigs just went by there, the Cashier Girls dumb as a rock, I don't know how she did it but got my order correct lol, ask for 2 drinks got 4 , told her I was dining there put it in a bag, no plates, no Ice in the Ice machine went to ask told the MNGR with Slippers in the kitchen, she just said OH ! when we were all finished she brings the Ice, too late girl. One of the girls there sitting where the food is being prepared, to top it off I hear screaming , yep killing roaches back there ... I was no way what did I just do.... Im afraid that was the last time in that KFC, who is in charge is there no supervision or just don't give a crap !  Wow !!"}
{"text":"No crispy chicken again? This happens at this Place a lot. Ugh, can't wait for Popeyes to open. Will drive out of my way to avoid this KFC."}
{"text":"Just leaving there and my chicken looks terrible and taste sooooo salty, the female at the drive through immediately had an attitude before I could even start saying my order. She didn't even give me eating utensils or straws. My drink is watered down, and my fries are stale. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy kfc in my country. I come to this place and I can say it is the worst food place I have been in Toronto. They gave me dippems that were a joke,  not real food. They were just crispy and no chicken. Also they don't have drink dispenser. They have only 2lt bottles and not all the drinks. It is not a restaurant. It is a bad joke that I hope you never visit to or at leadt I would like this place to shut down."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times I've had issues with their efficiency and customer service.  The employees give a lot of attitude and have trouble getting the orders out to you in a timely fashion.  It seems like they don't prepare for anything!   Hours before closing they're always out of Mac and cheese. Every other kfc never had a problem.  While waiting forever in the drive through at the window, we could see one of the workers locking the doors before the dining room was even closed. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"What horrible food!  And I'm a KFC fan... but I went to this location late at night (10:45) and ordered a chicken sandwich.  It was so dry I thought it must have been sitting around since the lunch rush.  The chocolate parfait was frozen so I had to wait two hours to enjoy it.  IF i'D WANTED A POPSICLE, I WOULD'VE BOUGHT A POPSICLE!  The employees were nice but didn't handle the food very well...

The cole slaw was great as usual though...

I wish they would offer a caffeine free sugar free beverage..."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOCATION!!!!  

I have been to many, many KFCs from the East Coast to Hawaii, and this is the worst one I've ever purchased food in. This is the second week in a row I've purchased food there. Last week the food was good, the service was terrible. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and went back again tonight, but both the service and the food was horrendous. When I pulled into the drive-thru there was only one car ahead of me, but when I pulled up to the speaker I was told I needed to wait because \"my computer needs to catch up.\"  After giving my order-twice-I pulled up to pay and receive my food. I sat and waited, and waited, and waited, thinking to myself that I should have gotten out of the car and gone inside. But then I realized, looking through the drive-through window, there were seven people standing in line INSIDE the restaurant. All in all, it took almost 20 minutes to receive my food. 

Unfortunately the quality of the food did not make up for the wait time: I did not get the 4 pieces of extra crispy chicken that I had ordered and the chicken I DID receive appeared to have been sitting around for some time after having been fried in old grease. This restaurant needs to SHUT down, and hire new employees who know how to cook and operate the drive thru window in an efficient manner."}
{"text":"OK....looking for great fried wings....call ahead and they will be hot and ready.  I love the service I get at the Cornelius KFC."}
{"text":"They gave us the wrong orders and when we asked for extra sauce they gave us taco sauce for our kfc!! Wtf!! This place is total bullshit !!"}
{"text":"What is KFC FRESH you ask?
I asked myself the same thing walking past this KFC location. 

The signage was modern, bright green, and made me think of salad.
I decided to check it out.
...The inside was pretty nice!

However, when it came to ordering, the staff was very confused while trying figure out how to assemble a salad bowl.

- And the salad was loaded with mayo dressing.
It kind of grossed me out.  (-  a few stars).

However, they do serve hot wings! And I do love hot wings! (+1 star).
The fried chicken items are still good, but salad = incredible fail."}
{"text":"This is exciting because I get to do two reviews for the price of one. Taco bell, and Kfc respectively. 

Taco Bell. To be honest I only wanted to review taco bell to tell this story. I went through the drive through with my buddy one time and, when we got to the pickup window the gentleman asked if we wanted fire sauce. We both declined, but at the last minute I changed my mind. What happened next changed my life forever. He responded \"yeeeeaaaaah take the fire sauce\" In the most high pitched and unexpected voice ever. Since that day it has been frequently mimicked by the both of us.

Oh yeah and the foods okay too. It's greasy taco deliciousness, at a cheap price. 

Kfc. Sometimes you just need some chicken. While Kfc locations can be very hit and miss, this location is consistently good. Their chicken is salty and greasy, it's great fast food."}
{"text":"Yes I know. It's dirty bird. What do you expect? Well  apparently, even my low expectations were too high.
 
The good, the bad and the ugly:

The good: Great tasting but it's kinda like cheating on your girl with a $10 hooker. You think you're getting a deal but you'll just feel dead inside after its over. 
The bad: The food is cold and not fresh at all. 
The ugly: I asked if it was possible to order a bucket of chicken with no drumsticks. If it wasn't, then no problem. But they said 'sure'. She spoke to the \"lady\" in the back and she looked a little pissed and glared at me. I told her not to worry if she couldn't accommodate the request. The last thing I need is spit mixed in with the colonel's secret recipe afterall. But she said \"fine\". When I get home? You guessed it. Bucket FULL of drumsticks. In fact there was NOTHING but drumsticks. Now, I understand if they couldn't give me what I wanted despite being a paying customer and being a seemingly minor request. But to go out of their way to stick it to me? Never had a place do that to me before. Truly Ugly. Avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"The worst KFC around.  Chicken strips cold mash potatoes cold.  Took 10 mins to take my order.  

Save Your Money. 
All the manager does is run orders outside that they can't keep up with."}
{"text":"Went there with the family last night.  The supervisor yelled at the cashier to stop taking orders. As the cashier politely apologized to the customer in front of my family, he excused himself to see what was the matter.  He came back and announced that it will be a 22 minute wait for chicken.
They ran out of chicken.
On a Saturday night.
We left and went elsewhere.  
22 minutes guys? Really?"}
{"text":"Went there again a few days ago.  Our food once again FRESH.  Me and my hubby both were happy with our meals.  Great food.  Worth the price.  They are so consistent.  I paid for my order and I had to wait 5 minutes because they were just making a fresh batch of chicken but I didn't mind waiting. Nothing better than fresh food."}
{"text":"I'm a pretty forgiving person when a food order is incorrect. I will try to be content with what is in the order, but after four occurrences of \"Not what I ordered\" at this particular KFC location, I just had to call and say something. We wanted to try the new Georgia Gold chicken. When we got all the way home we were stunned to see they gave us the Nashville Hot basket. It was so awful I couldn't put my tongue to it ( that is why we had ordered the mild tasting Georgia Gold basket in the first place). My phone calls to the number at the top if the receipt, 7 of them over an hour, never even went beyond 2 brief signals then disconnected. So now I'm done with KFC. Their menu is not that complex. Getting an order correct should not be that difficult!!!"}
{"text":"Lack of customer service and if your handicap not the place to go. Drive thru close and they refuse to assist if you unable to walk..."}
{"text":"my order was wrong and took forever and tasted like crap plus the employees were grab assing around and I seen them making out  a kid touch a girl on her ass in front of customers that is very un professional and they want a raise! grow up and act professional"}
{"text":"I have been to this KFC 3 times now because my husband takes me there and I have just had it.  It is just so disgusting there.  I told my husband to never take me there EVER again.  The chicken is always lukewarm - not fresh at all.  And every time I tell the cashier to make sure it's fresh and they just ignore you.  And it always feels dirty inside.  And there washroom was absolutely gross - piss on the floor.  Very dirty.  Gross.  They can't even make the place respectable for their customers.  Huge thumbs down!!!!"}
{"text":"I JUST BOT 2 KFC 10 DOLLAR BUCKETS THIS IS WHAT I GOT a 5 dollar fill up box and they charged me over 20 dollars for 2 very disappointed when you open the box you could see the bottom of the box wasnt filled way to lose customers kfc keep doing business like this you well be goin out of business thumbs down"}
{"text":"First time in this restaurant. Dining room was spotless. Restrooms spotless. Staff amazing. Food was hot and fresh. Was taken care of better than other more expensive restaurants. Recommend to all

Well my second time here. Not much more to add. Restaurant still spotless. Restrooms extremely clean. Food was hot and delicious. Staff was courteous and friendly.  Will come back again"}
{"text":"Delivery Oder from here. The fork was bigger than my chicken thigh and all the thighs were like they came off a pigeon . I liked KFC but this location. Turned me completely off and will never have it again do yourself a favour , there are better options out there"}
{"text":"They really don't deserve even one star. I bought a 16 piece bucket and added 2 more breasts to my order. I made it a family meal so I got the mash potatoes with gravy, some Mac n cheese and corn. Didn't receive corn when I got my order got two Mac n cheeses. But this isn't about messing up my order this is much much worse. These pieces of chicken were so bad. The breasts were the suspicious pieces I'm talking about. All of them five or six breasts looked like they had been laying in the drive through road and run over.  The were either smashed or what I suspect they did was they scraped off most of the meat to use for their other chicken products. They are thieving s o b's if you ask me. I've eaten at kfc's all over the country as I'm away from home 20 days a month and have never seen chicken breasts that looked like those. I was expecting the nice plump chicken breasts I've always loved and these people have me breaded bones. Not even edible. Shame on you kfc on horizon ridge and college in Henderson Nevada. No I won't stop going to KFC over this because this is an isolated incident. I didn't bother going back to tell them because I was furious. I would have gone too crazy down there. I can however write these reviews and get the word out that nobody should go to this restaurant. Im still in disbelief how they could sell crap like that even 3 days after the event. Next time I've got a little spare time I'm sending my comments to KFC corporate."}
{"text":"Yesterday I decided to skip cooking because it rained. In Arizona, that means it takes 2x as long to get home. Everyone decided to skip cooking. I saw the location at 67th n deer valley on my way home but figured to go here- closer to home, better chance of of it still being hot. My total time in the drive thru line was 25 minutes. I feel like 10 -12 minutes is about the longest a fast food drive thru should take at longest. 25 minutes is a sit down meal. 
Anyway- my family doesn't eat fast food often. The menu is hard to read here, specials are not posted and there is no menu preview, so I can't even weigh my options until Ive reached the speaker. I really have no idea what fast food places carry and the employees act like I should know what I want and they are bothered by waiting for me and then rushing thru my order. 
When I finally get to the window, there is a big vape sitting next to the register. I can't imagine that's ok? While you work in a food kitchen? Im sure there are some sanitation issues here. 
So here i am. At the window. Credit card ran. Food bagged and sitting at the window. He opens window and then engages in conversation with a coworker about a different order. Closes window. Continues conversation. My food still waiting inside by the window. I see why it took 25 minutes."}
{"text":"We were hungry for chicken and mashed potatoes , chicken was not bad ,but they had no tinsel's  to eat our mashed potatoes I can't believe this ,no spoons no forks for our mashed potatoes we had to go next-door to the gas station corner store for a spoon thank you people at the gas station 
PS I would not give them a star but I had to finish this"}
{"text":"I consistently get good food here. They are very careful not to serve anything that is of poor quality, and are apologetic for the wait should there be one. The staff are friendly and professional, which is a bonus downtown. I am a fat man ordering KFC, and I know I'm making a bad choice. It's nice that they don't feel the same need to eye-roll and smirk as some of the other restaurants nearby. 

Considering what they have to deal with in the way of crazies and hobos, the lobby is clean and the environment is friendly. I am genuinely impressed, the other places nearby have the same luck and do not perform as well."}
{"text":"Went there even though I saw the low score. At the drive thru I was advised it would take 10 minutes to cook the chicken. I decided to stay. I had ordered 2 family meals with 2 extra biscuits. After I paid they told me they didn't have enough biscuits. They advised me another 10 minutes. I pulled around and waited. They finally brought my food. After getting home they didn't give me my extra biscuits I paid and waited for. She also forgot the honey and butter she promised would be in there!"}
{"text":"After ordering 2 combos at the drive-thru I pulled up and was given the total. As I was getting my money out I was told by cashier Mia that I would not be receiving my drinks because they had no CO2. I asked if my total would be adjusted because of this and she said that was the price for the combo. I asked her if she seriously expected me to pay the same price for less product. She gave me an angry stare for about 10 seconds and then said she would get her manager. Shortly afterwards the manager came and without opening the window made some adjustments on the register then opened the window and stated my new total. There was NEVER an apology or even any courtesy whatsoever from either of them and the discount she gave me was sixty cents for two drinks! You people are in the wrong business! They both have absolutely the wrong attitude towards the guests that make their jobs possible. Shaking my head in disbelief at how bad the service was."}
{"text":"Yes it's fast food, basic customer service is expected but this location sucks.  The drive through kept having me repeat my order so I just went inside which took forever as well.  Try to avoid."}
{"text":"This store officially shows service time is 10:30am - 10:30pm, but when I was there at 9:50 pm,it's already clospm, If you provide an official service time, then you should always follow it. You cannot close early even just 5 minutes. Holy you closed 40 minutes even more earlier! Your customer drove twenty minutes there but get nothing at your service hour!"}
{"text":"Just went through drive thru ordered two famous bowls and they barley filled the bowl, also I tried to call the store and no one even answers. I will not be returning ."}
{"text":"How does a KFC run out of chicken breasts? Was told simply not available.  
Next time will go to Bojangles next door."}
{"text":"I haven't had KFC in a year, so I was actually looking forward to it. We placed our order through the drive through and after 10 minutes, we ordered a 2 pic box meal and Georgia Gold tenders basket. We even reiterated to the man who barely spoke English at the drive-thru that we wanted the Georgia Gold. When we got home, we found that we got the Nashville Hot and we were missing both biscuits. How do you forget the biscuits ever? It's the primary reason I wanted KFC. If it was normal chicken tenders, he could've had eaten it, but it was hot. I took a bite of the chicken and it tasted like it had been sitting underneath a heat lamp all day. I was already in my comfy pjs and had to get dressed again to go back to the restaurant. When I went back, the manager ended up being the man at the drive thru that barely spoke English. I had to request my money back 5 times after he kept trying to offer me free cole slaw and food to come back. I wasn't sure if he just didn't understand me, but the girl next to him had this confused look as well on why he wasn't understanding. After finally receiving a refund, he tried to give me the food I brought back and I refused to take it. It was the wrong order and the chicken tasted stale. Why would I even want that back?? Officially boycotting that KFC location in my neighborhood forever."}
{"text":"I live right next to this kfc. After 4 tries with them Im done trying to give them chances. Everytime I get food it takes like 15 minutes in the drive thru, then another time they said they were out of the chicken that they are promoting, at a chicken fast food place they are out of chicken. Last and final time I got another special, first half the order was given wrong. I called and called since I had to go to work and couldn't bring the food back and got no reply. And the chicken looked like it was shredded by a dog. And the hygiene in this place is nasty. I mean I own a business so I understand the value of a customer giving bad feedback and would relish the opportunity to fix any problems since we depend on the customer to have an amazing experience and come back so this place is definitely far gone and the manager needs to really up their game or franchisee needs to take control. Or corporate needs to get on their case for sure"}
{"text":"This KFC never has anything ready.  I have tried to go back several times just thinking maybe I just got the end of a rush but it's always the same thing, they are out or if they have it, it's gross tasting.  Take the time to find another KFC."}
{"text":"KFC shame on you!! Will never,ever, did I say never? Drive thru food okay I know it's wrong. What's worse is ordering at the drive thru..... and then I pulled up to the window I was asked what did you order?  I knew rite then and there to put my car in drive and say bye Felicia!!!!"}
{"text":"0 stars if possible. Drive thru menus were not lit up making it impossible to read. Ok minor detail I'll just go inside. Park and attempt to go inside and all doors are locked. It was 828pm. Doors say 930pm and on Apple Maps says 11pm."}
{"text":"Went here today to check out the Nashville Hot chicken. Excellent customer service from the woman (Dana) taking my order. The wait time was short. I probably waited about 3 minutes at the drive-thru window. I got home, opened some mail/packages, then got to my meal. The chicken was so fresh! It was perfectly made. Crisp, juicy, & saucy. The only thing that was missing was the pickles which I didn't mind because the chicken was so good. The Nashville Hot sauce is a bit smokey and gets your nose running a little bit. The heat of the spice isn't overpowering and it doesn't ruin the taste like some hot spices/sauces do."}
{"text":"It's always something when we go here. Out of chicken once, today out of biscuits. Young girl taking orders at drive thru is not helpful. She didn't even try to make ordering easier. Responds like a robot. The food was good once we got it and order was correct, although she overcharged me, but I caught it. It shouldn't be this difficult."}
{"text":"Visited this KFC on August 18, 2015. I must have bad luck when I go there. This time I was missing an item from my order. Disappointed needless to say. The question is does management really care."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and very hot. The customer service was another story. The woman in the drive thru was not very helpful, and she didnt hear me after I told her multiple times of which meal I wanted. Once I told her again after receiving my meal, she said \"there's nothing I can do, order has been processed\". So she couldn't have received more money and given me what I wanted? She offered no help. Other than her, this place is ok for a fast food place."}
{"text":"The Colonial must be turning over in his grave. This location was the go to spot in 2016, have no idea what happen but they have gone from KFC to nofc. Under cooked chicken( bloody ), out of sides, out of chicken selections, cash only and tonight drive thru closed and out of chicken selections again. That was my last and final visit KFC."}
{"text":"I think KFC is on their way out of business.  I know this is a bold statement, but consider my experience and that of other Yelpers...

The woman taking our order was helpful and even honored a KFC coupon that she was unaware of but accepted after I was able to show it to her on my phone. 

The food was good, but In my opinion, KFC is pricing themselves out of the market.  $35.00 for a fast food dinner for 4 is simply too high.  There are other options and many that are much healthier. At this price point, I have a much higher expectation than when I get takeout from the other less expense options.   

We ordered drumsticks and thighs and they gave us wings.  Unfortunately, we didn't become aware of their error until we got home and started serving dinner.  I recognize that some fast food restaurants no longer automatically include condiments and you must ask for them, but I was shocked that our takeout order was given to us  without even an offer of honey or butter for our biscuits or perhaps napkins.  Time will tell."}
{"text":"You can get an 8 piece meal with 2 sides for $21.99 or an 8 piece meal with 3 sides for $21.00.  They don't tell you about the better deal or post the number of sides on the cheaper meal.  The quality of the food was good."}
{"text":"I like Taco Bell. I like KFC. I don't eat much fast food but these are the two I prefer. So I love that I can get both at one place. Sadly the experience doesn't live up to the expectation. 

I would give this place more stars for the food, but both times I've visited (3 years ago, and this week), the service has been the absolute opposite of fast. I literally could have gone into a regular restaurant and ordered food and probably had it on the table faster than I got my food here at the drive-through. No joke, I waited almost 20 minutes start to finish. And you can't get out of the line once you are in due to the layout. When I got to the window for my food (finally) I could see the same few people waiting in line inside, so it doesn't seem to matter where you order, you will be waiting a looooong time. I'd give the drive through zero stars except the girl at the window was actually very pleasant and apologetic, and she got my order right. Everything was hot and fresh.

If you go, I recommend the Nashville Sweet and Spicy Chicken. The coating kind of reminds me of sweet BBQ potato chips with sriracha.It's actually quite hot, enough that my lips were slightly irritated. And I regularly eat and enjoy spicy food (Korean, especially) as a reference. So f you don't like heat, you shouldn't try this. 

So two stars for the food and the window employee. If they had one of these anywhere else convenient, I would not go here due to the horrendously slow service."}
{"text":"I just experienced THE WORST customer service EVER!!!!!  I went through the drive through and I was just sitting there.   I had to say,  \"hello?\"  And the employee came on  rudely and sarcastic saying, \"oh hi, I was just with another customer but I'll have them wait so I can take care of you\"  OMG!!!!  this employee has been at this location for years and I can't understand why he's still there, especially after store inspections considering his nails are about an inch long and are always dirty.    I called to get the managers name and of course he answered and was rude.   I hung up.   I'm never spending another of my hard working dimes at this location.   I'll drive to laveen and spend it on other hard working employees who understand how to do their job as customer service industry employees."}
{"text":"Like most KFCs, it's too slow to ever go again.  Order taking is slow.  They ran out of chicken tenders.  Often tasty food (other than fake mashed potatoes) but every other fast food is actually fast."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. KFC offers coupons on a Retail app for or phones, but come to find out, you have to print the coupon to use it. If the app is for our phones and we use when we are out, how would we print it. Also, the fact that no where on the coupon or adp does it say it needed to be printed. The manager Mitzy was very rude and laughed at me when I questioned it. I will never walk into another KFC again and I caution everyone from going somewhere that the manager laughs at you and doesn't care."}
{"text":"We went in during dinner time, I had not been to KFC in years, Angel was great even though it was a little hectic and they were busy!"}
{"text":"I have been to this KFC a few times and each time I have been disappointed. Today I ordered the 20 piece hot wing. They didn't have enough so they substituted chicken strips..no problem. I get the wings home they are all old and dried up ..the strips were nice and moist. I officially will not be returning. The times before I asked for 20pie e they hmm'd and haa'd about having to make them..now they don't have to worry about this order anymore. Thanks."}
{"text":"Probably the worst one in the city. I find I have better luck ordering it in; when I've gone in the food has never been fresh. You can see AND taste the difference on the chicken here, which is several shades darker than at other restaurants for some reason; I think they don't clean or change the oil?"}
{"text":"The food & management are beyond terrible. We went in 3-3-14 to get some chicken to go. The cheese & macaroni were spoiled & half the chicken was dried out. I called the restaurant 4x's & have never gotten a human. It always went to voice mail. I have left 3 messages & I have never received a call back. I called again today & the voice mail said the memory is full. I  called the corporate headquarters 3x's. I requested a call back & a supervisor to call me back 2x's. To date still no call back from the restaurant or KFC Headquarters . I will never go back. Don't waste your time or your money. I won't be going to any KFC. If I could give it less than a one star I would."}
{"text":"I usually like kfc every once in a while. They charged me an additional fee to use a credit card?  I was so annoyed I vowed never to return. Buyer beware, the menu price is not the actual price."}
{"text":"When you step through the front doors of this particular KFC location, you cross the threshold into Bizzaro Earth. 

The restaurant is decorated in a mish-mash of different KFC branding from the last 10 years. One door has an older version of their door decoration than the other, and there are hints of old versions of their interior decoration from different KFC styles, like decals, that I'd think some regional manager would see and lose their mind over, as I've witnessed in stores I've worked and shopped at. 

The customers here are an odd bunch. You'll see people chomping with their mouths open, wearing soiled pyjamas, or stuffing food into their pockets. You'll hear hacking death-coughs and heavy breathing. You'll smell those soiled pyjamas. 

The woman I often see at the register is just doing the best she can with no support. One time I was there and the cook's car went on fire or something, so he just left for 40 minutes after I'd placed my order. Sometimes the cooks are on important cell phone calls and just don't have time to make your order. Inevitably it's gonna take them 20+ minutes to make that sandwich your ordered, so ask for your drink when your food is up. 

Eventually, I'll get my food and send it back because I ordered my sandwich with nothing on it, and wait another who-knows-how-long for a replacement. I don't visit this place often, but after a couple of visits I realized that the kitchen cannot handle any special order. And I'll go back, because it's so damn close and I, uh, hate myself?"}
{"text":"OK the food is good and service. But all the soda is flat and doesn't foam up like it should.  I mentioned it to an employee.  Who apologized and said that they have been having issues with it and the carbonation was just just and should be good now. I told the employee it's not and no one else seemed to care. Good thing I don't come here often."}
{"text":"Not sure what everyone else is saying. Service was fast! Drive through was less than 3 minutes from beginning to end. And chicken treated like any other Kentucky fried chicken."}
{"text":"Waited over 15 minutes for the cashier to take my order. I can't believe the 3 people in line behind me waited. The manager kept yelling, \"don't take any more orders!\" I was about to walk out but I was on a mission not only for the YELP community but for the KFC Corporation. I'm sure they need to know what is going on at this location. Hope they can turn things around. It's not the product, it's the personnel. I decided to skip my normal bathroom visit. If they don't have their kitchen in order, I promise the bathroom is out too. The cashier finally took my order. You can tell she was embarrassed to take my order let alone charge me. KFC is going to have to do a lot better to earn my repeat business. Too much competition out there in the fried chicken business...:)"}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed tonight. To the point I will be speaking to a manager tomorrow. First thing I do is go to eat a delicious warm biscuit to find a stale cold biscuit that crumbled to pieces the moment picked up. ALL 4 OF THE BISCUITS!! Then I'm like oh I'll deal with it, I turn my attention to my 3 tender meal, where my mashed potatoes have not had the top secured and gravy is all over the box and not on the mashed potatoes. Not to mention that they are cold moving on. My chicken tenders where next. Pretty simple chicken and bbq nothing crazy going on with this order. Except the chicken is cold and the bbq is not in the bag. I turn to my wife and ask her about her meal. Her entire meal was cold. I am not the kind of person that posts a lot but when not one not two but everything in my order is bad it's just unacceptable!"}
{"text":"This place sucks!!! Orders wrong 3 out of past 4 times through. This time got all the way home. Apparently staff can't count to 3. That's three tenders. One flat disformed something and nothing else in the box. How do you miss that?"}
{"text":"After i walked past the homeless guy sitting outside the door eating chicken and entered This KFC i noticed it was Really small but neat and up to date. The service was prompt and the food came on time. Our server was nice, Really nice i almost wanted to leave him a tip. In the middle of my meal another homeless guy walked in and his trash bag full of his stuff ripped open and spilled all over the floor,  The nice server grabbed a mop and cleaned up whatever had spilled. Besides that it was a good experience at KFC"}
{"text":"Tonight at 9:12pm I drove about half mile from my home to 8050 E Indian School Rd, Scottsdale, AZ 85251. I have been craving chicken all day, and I usually go to KFC for my lunch several times a month. When I arrived at this location I saw that there were quite a few people in the drive through. Within 2 minutes at least 4 people left without even recieving food. After I got to the window I asked for a 2pc meal and a 3pc tender meal for my wife. Immediately after asking for my 2pc the employee taking my order asked if I wanted Original, Crispy or Grilled. I asked for Crispy as I always do. Immediately after that he said \"I'm sorry actually we only have grilled chicken available for your 2pc.\" To which I replied I really want crispy chicken please?! He continued and said he only had my 2pc available in grilled. I then asked him what time they close and he said 10. I asked him how could he only have grilled chicken available when they close in nearly 1 hour! He then gave me attitude and said that only grilled chicken could be ordered. After that I became upset and pulled up to the window and asked for the manager. He told me that he was the manager to which I asked his name, and he told me his name was Tyler. I then asked for the corporate number and he told me \"Im not going to give you the phone number to corporate\" and i said \"i can just look it up online\" and he said \"do what you gotta fu**ing do!\" and slammed the door in my face. I was very upset and very hungry! I have been a restaurant manager for nearly 10 years and I would never expect one of my employees to treat a customer this way! I was treated as such an inconvenience, and I ended up going home and making a sandwich for dinner... I really hope KFC can make this right. I love KFC, I was raised in West Virginia and KFC is in my blood.

P.S. I wrote a whole message out on your website and when I submitted it I was redirected and I don't think it even went through. I hope you guys can make this right, I am disgusted at the way he treated me by your manager Tyler. I really don't appreciate him lying to me and saying friend chicken wasn't available. I can only imagine how much money you guys are losing by this man telling people an hour before close that only grilled chicken or whatever is left is available for their meals.

 Christopher Adam Stone"}

{"text":"I had a craving for fried chicken so I thought I would try out this KFC.  The food was ok, not great and not horrible...at least that's what I thought at the time.  Turns out, the chicken wasn't completely cooked and I ended up with the worst case of food poisoning I've ever had.  3 days later and I'm still sick.  I will never eat at KFC again and I would stay away from here if I was you."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever seen. Slow half the time orders are wrong. Not polite at all. Floors are sticky in the entire store.  Was back in the store February 23 the person I was with had to wait 15 minutes for her food after she ordered before me and 3 other people. Everyone got their food before her and they ran out of popcorn chicken. When they finally made the chicken they gave it to people other then the one waiting the longest. I've never seen such incompetence."}
{"text":"Not a bad KFC as far as these thing go.  Sometimes you just want something bad.  It takes a bit longer than some other fast food places but that's because they're frying it up fresh right?  

Really no issues here and it's not fine dining but, the heart wants what it wants right?"}
{"text":"If I could give this establishment no stars, I would!! We ordered 2 $5 fill-up boxes and they had none of the food except the potatoes and gravy. No crispy breast, no original leg and thigh, 14 minute wait on biscuits. I asked for a refund and you'd think I asked for the food and double my money back. This would be a great place to sell chicken and biscuits!!! Colonel Sanders is rolling over in his grave right about now. Avoid this catastrophe unless you are starving, in which case there is still a chance you may starve waiting for your food. The house definitely has the advantage on this game!!"}
{"text":"The last time I was there, (several months ago) I had to wait 30 minutes for our order, and they got it wrong.  The manager was of no help - he was too flustered to handle it.

{"text":"This KFC should Close Too - Beware, you have been Warned!

My wife and I Ordered  9 pieces mixed Chicken dinner. I asked if it had white pieces like breast and wings, and they said yes. Well we only received 7 pieces, not 9 and they were legs and two thighs. They were cold and old tasting. The biscuits were hard hockey pucks. The mashed potatoes were cold old tasting as well as the gravy. The slaw slushing and watery. I have to say it was the worst food I've ever had.
I called the KFC and the phone just rings and somebody just hangs up on the call. 
Stay away this place should not be open, they just closed the Horizon Ridge Store, Beware!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just awful!  The chicken was so dry and tough, not fresh at all, no juice. Even had a strange flavor as well. Next i tried a cookie, on the bag it says fresh daily, not! Was so hard had to be at least a week old. They also forgot some of our items we ordered. I see why this location is rated so low, the worst KFC i have ever been too."}

I'll find another KFC nearby next time. 5 within a ten mile radius"}

Food came out in a timely manner, except whoever called out our order really just left the food on the counter with no regard for the customer. I'm thinking that might have been the shift lead. Anyhow, the only thing that stops this from receiving the 5th star is that when our chicken littles came out, the bread was stale. We're talking so stale that you can actually hurt someone with a decent throw to the head. Luckily, she (Sally) got them remade with fresh bread. So that was cool. Seems like management is lacking in this location.Until changes are made here in regards to that, this place is just bleh."}

Our chicken was slimy and we had to heat it up when we got home because it was already cold (we live 2 minutes away) but for two people who never eat fast food chicken, we laughed at it. I guess Col Sanders' ghost was listening because the hit us like a tidal wave a few hours later. Now that I've regained consciousness, I wanted to make sure no one else made the same mistake."}

God damn that was a long sentence.

KFC Double Down muthafuckas!!!!!!!

Yes, that's right, I've literally eaten KFC Double Downs for every meal for..... when did they come out?...... I don't know whenever they came out.  If you don't know what a Double Down is, then you obviously don't watch enough ESPN and other channels that target fat lazy dudes.  The KFC Double Down is the brainchild of what must be the fattest genius on Earth, designed specifically to trigger the glutton-reflex in the human brain.

Picture this:
Take a delicious chicken sandwich from your favorite joint.

Put bacon and a sweet tangy sauce on it.  Hungry aren't ya?

But something is missing right?


NOW TAKE THOSE TWO PANSY ASS PIECES OF BREAD, THROW THAT SHIT BACK INTO THE DRIVE THRU WINDOW, AND SAY \"GIMME ANOTHER PIECE OF CHICKEN BITCH!

You don't need bread!  Just put the freakin bacon and sauce IN BETWEEN the chicken filets!  You like grilled chicken?  Get grilled chicken.  You like fried chicken?  Get fried chicken.  

Or you can follow in my Chicken Jesus-like footsteps and get one of each.  QUADRUPLE DOWN!!!

Seriously, I know most of you are all \"GROSS!!\" and thinking that I must be a raging alcoholic or constantly high to like this thing, but trust me, IT. IS. INCREDIBLE.  Eat a bunch of salads all week and tell yourself that you're healthy, go get a KFCDD, a 40 of OE, and sit on your ASS and enjoy the wonders of a true poultry masterpiece.  

Plus you need protein homie, you're lookin a little flaco.  Yeah, you.  If you need me, I'll be in the drive thru."}
{"text":"Wow couldn't believe this KFC!
So nasty 
the floors were dirty all the tables still had food on them and NO ONE was in there.
The gravy was thin the tea was out and when I said something they offered to make more but never did"}
{"text":"Zero stars for me. This store needs to be revamped! Its the WORST ever...... I dont know who owns this franchise but they need to  clean shop... Very unprofessionally dressed along with other things.."}
{"text":"Went in there a couple of weeks back.  The cashier actually was in a conversation with the customer in front of me talking about medical marijuana.  Highly inappropriate.  Usually a good l place to go but will have to review my next choice of restaurant when this is a consideration."}
{"text":"Every time I've gotten food here, I've thought about posting this review.  But that would mean that I'd have to admit in public that I've eaten here, and returned.  Well, I try to avoid fast food as much as possible, but once in a while I get a craving for something.

It helps to eat here if you think of the dine-in experience as live dinner theater re-enacting the film Idiocracy.  If you do this, it can take an aggravating situation and turn it into brilliant satirical comedy.  Expect shortages, especially the thing you ordered, 25 minute waits if you insist on getting the thing you ordered, and indifference from the staff."}
{"text":"KFC has seriously gone down hill .WAYY over priced .will stick with Churchs chicken from now on"}
{"text":"I  am loathed to give this place any stars. Customer service is nonexistent. Its the worst KFC experience ever. Unreasonable wait times and lost orders are popular here. The staff don't care."}
{"text":"One word: gross!

Went to their drive-thru to pick up few pieces to take home around 10:50pm (I believe close to their closing hour).  Ordered 8 pcs but upon checkout I found out they sent 12 pcs to be cooked and billed me for it.  Ok fine, I took the extra pieces as the hassle to get them correct the order wasn't worth it for me.

Once they handed me the take out bag, my whole car was filled with a nasty burnt smell and not the usual fried chicken smell you would normally get. I suspect either they had to recook the order because it was sitting out for a while considering it was closing time anyway or they badly needed an oil change.

When I got home, a 3 min drive from their location, I immediately inspect the chicken. It was hot so I know it just came off the deep fryer but what shocked me was the quality of the chicken. They weren't like what you would normally get: crispy skins and reasonably seasoned.  What I got was not the case as it was soggy and drenched with oil. Some pieces look like they weren't even cooked properly as the skin was just oily, mushy and under cook yuck! 

I was contemplated to just going back to return their products but had a feeling they would be closed so I tried to call their restaurant immediately but nobody would pickup. I assume they didn't want to take anymore calls.

So I suck it up and made the best out of a bad experience and tried to eat what ever pieces that looked like they were edible.  Big mistake! The breading on some of the pieces had no flavour what so ever and all I tasted was flour and a burnt after taste, really awful and a huge turned off. On top of that, my order of gravy looked old and barely warmed when I got home.

Really regret going to this place. Wished I would just drive 5 mins down the street to the nearest Popeye location as they never failed on their chicken. 

I would NEVER return to this place EVER! Why send such garbage food to a customer who have frequent their drive through in the past. I understand I might have been the last person to take the order but if you can't even deliver reasonable product to your customer, just tell them you were closed for the night.

Pics of their product taken right after I took them out of the box doesn't do justice. They really are gross and oily as shit!"}
{"text":"Pros: Not one employee was standing around, chatting or day dreaming; everyone was moving and working (albeit sometimes a little chaotically). The following isn't because the \"worker bees\" weren't working. 

Cons: This is not \"fast food\"......My family waited in the car while I went in to place a \"to go\" order.  While waiting to place my order (an extra crispy bucket, 10 wings and an additional side) the manager (a woman who seemed to be in charge and telling employees what to do), came to the counter and called out a number. 

The customer came up and the manager said \"Sorry, we're out of biscuits, would you like something else?\" The customer said \"how about corn?\"  \"OK, we'll substitute corn.\"  Another gentleman waiting said \"I'll take the corn too since my order is right after her's.\"  \"OK.\"  

After instructing the worker to substitute corn, the manager called out another number....the customer approached the counter and she said \"I'm sorry, we're out of thighs legs and wings in \"original recipe\" would it be OK if I substituted \"extra crispy?\"  \"OK, he said and was on his way. 

I waited and waited....I'd been there about 15-20 minutes when she called out my number....I answered and she said....\"Sorry, I'm out of (and listed 4 or 5 pieces of chicken) in \"extra crispy. Can I substitute \"original recipe?\"  I said \"No\" and she responded by saying then you'll wait?\"  I said, \"wait for how long?\"  She disappeared into the rear of the kitchen came back and said about another 15 minutes.\"   I said \"no, I won't wait.\"  She replied saying \"I'll give you your money back, can I have your receipt.\"  She came back with my cash, handed it to me and said, rather matter of factly \"Have a nice day.\" turned around and walked away. 

If I was the only \"odd man out\" I would have thought \"well, not my day.\"  But customer after customer???  Out of biscuits???   Out of Original Recipe????   Out of Extra Crispy???  Geez...get organized.  I've been in plenty of busy KFCs ...I've never seen one so poorly execute their main mission...serve chicken and sides to their customers in a reasonably prompt manner. This is definitely a \"do not return\" restaurant for me."}
{"text":"I wasn't exactly sure what to rate you. Either 1 star because of the excruciating long wait of 5 because the long wait gave me time to rethink my eating habits and I decide to go somewhere healthier. Thank you for the extremely long wait. I ate some great food that made me feel satisfied and good about myself."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this was one of the worst experiences I've had at any KFC. The food was leftover, but we still had to wait 25+ minutes for it to come out. The employees were also very rude. I hate leaving bad reviews, but I would recommend avoiding this location if possible."}
{"text":"The worst kfc i have ever been to. They are rude and run out of the chicken all the time. It is on my way home from work and I really like KFC but I have been given the wrong order several times and I have been told that they were out of chicken and not making any more an hour before closeing. The last time I went inside and stood at the counter for a long time when I asked why I had to wait so long and asked to speak to the manager she told me to leave."}
{"text":"I grew up on KFC fried chicken. My family would have it at least once every couple of weeks. Over the years, my palette has gone from KFC to Popeyes, and now to local joints doing their own version of fried chicken. But one thing has always \"perked\" up my long forgotten feelings for the Colonel. That thing would be... the Double Down.

I first saw the Double Down on TV a couple of years ago. After the initial backlash from the media and other groups, I thought that it would follow in the footsteps of the Arch Deluxe. To my surprise, I recently saw a commercial saying that they have brought back the Double Down. This time, I would not let opportunity to slip through my fingers.

This location is actually pretty nice. It's clean and well taken care of. Even though the hours say it closes at 10pm, the drive thru is open to 11. I came here at around 10:30 and the manager who took my order was very kind and helpful. What is great to know is that since it gets slower at night, they usually cook the food when the order comes in, so that they won't waste throwing away a lot of food at the end of the night. That also means that you will have fresh chicken straight out of the fryer, and not ones that have been sitting under a heat lamp for the past hour.

Double Down - Two pieces of breaded chicken that are fried until crispy. These are essentially the \"buns\". In the middle of these buns are bacon, melted cheese, and the KFC secret sauce that taste very similar to ranch. I gotta say, this is probably my favorite sandwich of all time. I wish every sandwich could be like this. Fried chicken, bacon, cheese, and sauce in sandwich form. It's brilliant. I probably want to give the person who invented this a Hi-5. No, I should say, 2 Hi-fives!!! Maybe 3 but I don't want to be too greedy. Even though it's ok because I like the sandwich so much.

Couldn't give the place 5 stars because I don't believe in factory farmed chicken. I'm sure the sandwich I ate was loaded with hormones and antibiotics. But, a great sandwich nonetheless. KFC, you slay me."}
{"text":"Seems none of the fast food places can get it right. No lie 6 out of 10 times your order will be wrong. I order a chicken strip meal and get no sauce, a biscuit with no butter packet? Why do I have to ask again for these things? They cannot handle the crowd, drink area gets messy and the design of this particular KFC is old and ragged. I do say this though, I chose to go there so my bad. Now I can chose not to. Live and learn. I hadn't been to a KFC in a while and I guess for good reason. The menu isn't very appealing. You are pretty much forced to get a meal. At least at other fast food places you can get individual items. I thought KFC had a Value Menu other than 1 chicken slider sandwich for $1.69 which seems rather high considering what it is, small strip and small bun."}
{"text":"Always rude, and the worst service I've ever experienced at fast food, it amazes me how bad this place is."}
{"text":"We live about 4 miles away from this KFC (Gilbert & Baseline).  We ordered two 2pc white-meat meals and got dark meat. When I called their phone went unanswered (typical of their help, I'm sure) and I finally got a recording!  Called back and same thing (yes, checked the phone number, etc.  This is the THIRD time we have had problems at this KFC. Sadly, it seems as if this store is poorly managed and the help they hire isn't worth the minimum wage they are probably being paid. They are surly, rude, and dumb as sticks on top of it all. Avoid this KFC like the plague if you want my advice. There are newer and far cleaner stores in Mesa and Tempe and Gilbert that actually have well trained and polite and helpful staff. Too bad this isn't one of them! Who ever owns/manages this mess of a store ought to be ashamed of the lousy service, rude help and fairly dirty store! Do not go here even if you're starving!"}
{"text":"Seems that changed ownership/management, got chicken on last Thursday, opened up when we got home and the pieces were small, was not coated properly, looks like they split a breast piece in half and sell it as 2 pieces.  Coming here for years, but not again, rather go to Markville."}

{"text":"First i found a string in my chicken tenders. Then went to eat the biscuit and it was still doughy and not cooked all the way. The cookie was falling apart and seems to be undercooked as well. Boycotting kfc now."}
{"text":"Went there at 9pm to find the doors locked. The sign clearly states that they close at 10pm. I should have listened to the other yelpers reviews instead of wasting my time going to that location."}
{"text":"As a follow-up to my original post: KFC sent me a letter from Mrs. Burnett, KFC's area coach, informing me of two things that have caused me to pause and wait for a response from them. I am doing this because they seem to be in direct violation of the law.

1 - She quotes Dodd Frank federal law 124.STAT.2073, 9b2. Here is her quote:
\"Stated in federal law §124.STAT.2073, 9b2 businesses are permitted to offer a immediate discount to customers as an incentive to encourage customers to pay by either credit card, cash, check, or gift card in order to automatically receive a discount which is applied at the time of sale. We offer no discount when paying with a debit card.\"

2 - \"We would like to offer you a complete refund on your purchase and again sincerely apologize for the confusion, if you will fax a copy of your receipt to 1-XXX-XXX-XXXX we will make sure you are reimbursed at the above mailing address.\"

Apparently, Mrs. Burnett is no attorney and seems to have little to no experience reading federal law. Each section of this act ends with definitions to clarify what exactly what the law means when referring to language used in the act. In this case, the clarifying term is \"DISCOUNT\". Here is a direct quote from the act regarding discounts:

\"(4) DISCOUNT.--The term 'discount'-- 
(A) means a reduction made from the price that customers are informed is the regular price; and 
(B) does not include any means of increasing the price that customers are informed is the regular price\" (§124.STAT.2073)

What KFC has implemented is actually in direct violation of what they are quoting in their response letter to my complaint with the Attorney General's office of AZ. They are blatantly increasing the price of an order from the regular price and not offering a discount.

Lastly, I have not received a refund as promised in the letter after faxing my receipt to the number she gave me twice.

I am simultaneously updating the attorney general's office. I can't stand aside in good conscience and allow for this company to rob the citizens of the state of Arizona."}
{"text":"Love kfc. Hate this place. Was just telling my mom how your order always goes up for negotiation here. Ordered 20 pice hot wings. Well they only have 15. Then the awkward silence then eventually I get \"do you still want 20?\" Eff yeah I do! If I wanted 15 I would've ordered 15. Then they ask me if I wanted to substitute my wings with wedges. That is NOT equivalent exchange. So when you come here prepare to \"pull up please\" but first he prepared for someone to try to renegotiate your order to make their job a bit more easier."}
{"text":"Michael is the store manager for this location. I have passed through this KFC for the last 12 years about once every 8 weeks. I enjoy the grilled chicken and the chicken tenders. I am not interested in any of their side dishes as they do not taste authentic to me. Michael when I was I went through drive-thru made me some fresh chicken tenders that were fresh and juicy. The customer service is excellent during the day but during the dinner hour this is a place - stay clear of as it is a different shift of people and Michael is not there after mid afternoon so the control is gone. Great chicken better than LoLo's."}
{"text":"I was never one to find rudeness anywhere in good business ethics, but then again, this is KFC, so what should I expect ? Probably shouldn't cut customers off though, not allowing them a chance to finish their order, and serve cold food . Shout out to the short pudgy Curley haired employee.... Where did you learn your social skills dude. Will not be venturing out of discount tire again !!!!!"}
{"text":"I have gone to this location for the past 5 weeks to ask for a dam chicken pot pie and they never have the pies ready I go at 11:30 am and these people can't get their bs together and have  a simple dam pie ready who ever the manager is honestly bad choice kfc you have gave a position to someone who clearly can't handle it the team there is pathetic no effort at all is put in this business the workers have given up and don't care anymore"}
{"text":"This location has poor customer service. Especially at the drive thru. You literally have to ask for service. You have a bunch of kids running this place who do not know what they're doing. On top of that, they charged me 39 cents to use my card. Never going back to this place."}
{"text":"I just ate here with my family and Dillion greeted us. He was extremely nice and was busting his butt off. What a great employee!!! Food was fast, hot and yummy."}
{"text":"In Drive thru, first person on intercom very rude.  Another lady stepped in very nice, helpful.  They were out of the doublicious sandwiches.  So got the#9, potpie meal, it was ok.  Supposed to have a cookie included (not). Also got a three piece, 2 sides.  Only one fork included.  Not happy overall."}
{"text":"Staff is lazy and rude!  I had wait for 10 mins to order because of nothing.  They didn't even have the full menu cooked."}
{"text":"Food is good of coarse because it's KFC, but check your order!!! They sure as hell don't care if they forget your food."}
{"text":"kentucky fried chicken so what are you expecting? the chicken way is better than what i had expected but what made my experience stand out was the service of one young man. it really seems as if they were short handed today but this young black man named Cuevon? was cool as ice. He not only handled the entire walk in without breaking a sweat but he did so professionally and with pride. If I had any business that was hiring, he'd be exactly what I want as the face of the company."}
{"text":"If there was an option for negative stars they would get it. It took 25 minutes from the time we ordered at the speaker to get our food. The crew was rude and disorganized. We were left at the drive thru without so much as a greeting until they wanted our money.
After getting our food we then had to wait another 5 minutes to get someone's attention to get our drinks, straws, and silverware. This is the worst KFC I have ever been to."}
{"text":"This place sucks I won't go back. They took 30 to 40 minutes just to get r food. They gave orders to people that came in after us."}
{"text":"This was not the KFC I use to know. The food quality for the sandwich was terrible. Way more bread than meat by far. The bacon was almost small enough to fit in a Bacos shaker. I feel ripped off. What happened to KFC being the best chicken amongst the fast food trade?"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of kfc although I will eat it every now and then because when I eat at a chicken place it's normally at wingstop Popeyes or churches those are the only chicken places that I will touch but I digress came to this particular kfc location yesterday in the evening to get a meal for 5 people had to come back twice as I wasn't sure of the deals going on the lady that took my order was friendly the positives of this place not too many most of the food well only half of it seemed  like it was fresh that being the potato wedges which I always get and the biscuits which is hit or miss at any kfc you'll get them hard super hard or how there supposed to be soft. Now on to the negatives this kfc location doesn't have rice or beans I expected them to at least have the baked beans they advertise on tv no go all they had were green beans mashed potatoes Cole slaw and potato wedges which I got for a separate order can't believe they didn't have the baked beans they said they do sell them here but they dont have them or the rice and mac and cheese at this location. Finally the chicken was not fresh at all most of the chicken that I ate the skin was either hard to chew through or the meat was tough to swallow or digest it was a main problem for me as I thought I was going to choke on some of the pieces of chicken I ate or the skin as it was tough from what the chicken looked like it seems like they had it sitting out for a couple hours because it didn't taste fresh at all other then that this was my first time eating kfc in awhile let alone this location and I think I'll just stay away from this location when I come around in this area and get El Polo Loco Popeyes or whatever chicken place not name kfc as that was a terrible experience well eating the chicken anyway from here."}
{"text":"Never have grilled chicken. If they don't bother having it in stock then take it off the menu!"}
{"text":"So on a Friday evening at 5:30pm I pull up to the drive thru and expect to be greeted but it's silence....for a good 3mins. I'm saying hello...hello and then finally someone comes in laughing telling me oh ma'am please look over the menu and I'll be right with you  at his point 5 mins have passed so I've looked over the menu already...anyway once the young man comes back I asked for wings, he tells me it's going to be a 10min wait as they are cooked upon order. Fine I ask for a 2 piece and he proceeds to tell me it's going to be a 16min wait....excuse me whaaaa??!!! So I ask what do they have made at the moment, it's only tenders....ok like really wtf! How do you NOT have your top selling menu item cooked??! Not sure if this was a 1 time thing or it happens all the time, either way I'm turned off and won't be going back to that location. The dude working the drive thru was unprofessional and no food was ready...#DoBetter"}
{"text":"I thought I'd try again for chicken this evening and found so many cars in the drive thru that you can't get into the parking lot and then waiting 15 min to even order. now waiting for another 15min because the kids want extra crispy. Not a whole lot of smiling faces and they move sloooowwwwwwww."}
{"text":"I love KfC however this location left a bad taste in my mouth!

Chicken tastes funny, must have been left out a while!

The only edible item was the biscuit.

Avoid this location like the plague!"}
{"text":"This location has never been great, however they went from being hit N miss to just bad each time over the past year or so...

Chicken Tonight was - Super Greasy, possibly re-cooked or something, the meat was slimy and greasy inside!  The underside of the skin was partly missing and spotted on all the parts of the meat.  The wings looked like roadkill!

They never get the order right, but its so standard at this location usually its the least of the problems..

People go here to save the drive elsewhere, but we will not anymore!

KFC has a great product, and if i ordered food late at night i could expect older food, but this was 7pm on a Friday night!

Time that this location took pride in their product, hired new staff and served edible food!"}
{"text":"When I order Taco Bell, I expect a little bit of disgusting and a lot of gross. But, this Taco Bell (also a KFC) was a little beyond gross. My order was leaking grease, so much so that the plastic bag that hid that goodness was also caving under the weight of the grease.

My Taco Bell experience in Arizona. Not good."}
{"text":"Had no issues for this KFC. Went literally right before close.  Ashley was extremely nice + patient and was able to mix my 2 piece to one gold and one red hot!! She got my order correct and told me about their survey to get a free go cup."}
{"text":"I just sat in the drive thru for 10 minutes and then when it was finally time for me to order they said there was a 10 minute wait for chicken...this place is a waste of your time!"}
{"text":"KFC still has the deep fried, breaded chicken and sides. But, be prepared for sticker shock! That's what happened to me when a friend asked me to stop and get them some lunch. Wow! Glad I wasn't buying! Overpriced is what comes to mind when I think of KFC now. 

The service was okay. The food was okay. Save some money and hit the local grocery store deli on the way home."}
{"text":"1. I just bought 4 original chicken meal 
With extra coleslaw 
2. Drive thru was bit slow but reasonable wait 3 cars in front of me. 
3. Amount of time they took to bring me out the food and paying was flawless. It was only about 5 min 
4. I checked the bag and had everything in it forks napkin sauces etc 
5. I wanted the crispy chicken meal but it was 9:45 pm so fair enough that it's sold out or whatever. 
6. I drove back home and tried the leg first it was very juicy and nice temperature, thighs good size juicy , coleslaw was fresh, mashed potato with gravy was excellent and lastly breast was even more juicy and good tasting I mean it's been more than 7 years since I ate at any KFC joint I still like ones in east coast locations much better but I have nothing to complain today !!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place no stars. Given this place three chances. EVERY TIME they screw up my order. This last time, the food was disgusting. I hope it gets shut down. Seriously, I get better service from gas stations. Should have learned my lesson two visits ago."}
{"text":"I have absolutely no stars for this place! I went threw the drive thru to order and the girl at the drive thru was so rude! I ask if I could substitute a side and she was like um no. The manager got on and said I'm sorry we can't substitute which is fine no big deal but the big deal was the original girl who was taking my order to begin with was laughing and saying omg so disrespectful I will never go here again that's not the way you treat costumers!"}
{"text":"Just left this place and I think that I need to call the Hazmat crew to disinfect me after I walked into the men's restroom. It was filthy, human waste all over the place and when I let the manager know she didn't even shut it down or put a sign on the door to let customers know that it's out of service , instead she left it alone and let other customers walk in and come out horrified about to vomit. Good job manager , I also had to throw away  my shoes."}
{"text":"Ugh this place is so infuriating!  I have been here three times and the last time was the very first time they ever got my order right, but also the third time I had to wait 5+ minutes for my food.  On top of that, I was given ELEVEN, count them, 11 packages of flatware to go with my 3-piece meal.  I mean, I guess she thought I would need one fork for every napkin??  I don't know, it was odd, and now I feel all of this guilt about wasting plastic utensils. 

The other two times I've arrived home to the wrong food and one of the times they literally told me they were out of green beans.  How is that even possible?  This is also the only fast food place where I've ever been compelled to call their customer service WHILE I was in line.  There were tons of kids roaming around in there (I was in the drive through) and only one poor girl was making any attempt to prepare my meal.  Trust me, I had plenty of time to chat with the lady in Kentucky.  

I wish I could count on this place to get my order right every time as we really do like their grilled chicken and mashed potatoes (when we actually get them)."}
{"text":"(For Taco Bell side) The employee Shannon was awesome, KFC was awesome as usual, however I ordered a steak doubledilla from the taco bell and it tasted off. I ate half of it and just thought it was the sauce or something but the second half I took a couple bites and it tasted a little sour, almost bitter. I talked to a manager and was told it's all made the same way and nothing could be done. Pretty short. I wasn't wanting anything free, just bringing up a quality issue. I get that people complain about the stupidest things to get free stuff and it gets irritating, but I'm leaving this rating for now. Only my second visit here and didn't feel like my input was valued. Thank you Shannon for making me feel welcome."}
{"text":"Great experience. Restaurant was clean, nice size.  Plenty of parking, well located, parking lot clean.  The staff was polite, friendly and great customer service.  The food was hot, tasted fresh and received pretty quickly.  Good portions.

Don't hit fried chicken for fast food very much, but this KFC made me glad I did!"}
{"text":"Seriously is there only one person working here!? Waited 2 min at the counter to have no one even show to take my order. So instead of serving my self (like I should have) I go through the drive through and am told to \"hold on\". Get out of here with that! There's no one in the store."}
{"text":"Go before 1PM because after that they completely stop rotating food and it just gets worse and worse with each shift change.  I've had a few good experiences here and then twice as many average/bad experiences.  This is the type of place to mess your food up and get a attitude with you cause you pointed it out.  If you need something quick to hold you over then stop in but I'd say your life will be just fine if you never ate here."}
{"text":"Wasted my time and gas driving to this facility on my lunch break to find that they had no grilled chicken available, which is specific to my dietary needs. What kind of chicken place doesn't have all varieties of chicken available? This isn't the first time this has happened."}
{"text":"Prices are higher than off the strip branches, but I guess that comes with being on the strip and catering for the tourists. Ordered the #10 chicken strips combo. The only good thing here was that the potato wedges were just cooked. The bad part was the chicken strips, they were dry and the coke did not taste like coke at all, more like it was watered down. I suggest if you want KFC, go off the strip for something cheaper and better tasting. Try their branch over at Spring Mountain."}
{"text":"There are two things you can count on consistently here - they'll be out of something (tonight was grilled white meat and jalapeños) and painfully slow service. I go infrequently enough in the hopes the service will improve but it's always poor."}
{"text":"Unfortunately their reviews aren't so high. I personally have not had any problems though. Corrin did a great job at helping me out :) this location is clean, fast, and friendly.  I really do recommend this place if you are near by :) Also, take their survey and you get a free desert. Why not??"}
{"text":"Slowest service ever. 
They said 4 minutes and it's been longer than 12. 
When you walk in no one greets you and they see you but ignore you. 
Never again will I come here."}
{"text":"We did drive-through here one night when Raising Cane's was closed for a holiday. Chicken tenders were dry and rubbery and tasted like they'd been sitting around a while. The only good thing in our combo meals was the warm cookie. Otherwise, ick."}
{"text":"KFC, quite like Taco Bell at 4am, tends to bring out a lot of \"eccentric\" individuals. It's always interesting to go inside and wait in line at this joint, for reals.

I've gone through the drive through, maybe once, but I really prefer going inside. It's definitely not the epitome of clean establishments, and I've often tried not to look in the back to see what the teenage kid at the fryer is doing - but the food is what you would expect from KFC and the Crispy Strips are my fave. 

The staff is quite nice and my order was taken by the manager the last time I was in - he was super friendly and accomodating. I feel bad giving them a two, but it's just not the best fast food experience I've ever had."}
{"text":"Just horrible! I've never been to this location and gotten a decent meal. The chicken is ALWAYS old or over-cooked. Do yourself a favor and avoid  this location."}
{"text":"Seriously, this place sucks! Every time I decide to go to this KFC somehow they always manage to forget to put everything I paid for in the bag. Really? It's not that difficult."}
{"text":"As far as Fast-Food chain goes, 

it was consistent. 

Chicken was not greasy neither was the fries.

I find this location to have Smaller pieces compared with other franchaises. Make sure to check your box to see if your chicken is not burnt. (Sometimes)

I went here after my disappointment with a raved yelp resturant."}
{"text":"This place sucks!!!! Would give zero stars if I could Got the 6 tenders and fries first off they gave me 4 small pieces of chicken and a super small piece of chicken that was mainly bread. So I seriously only got 5 pieces... and the fries where so burned you might as well call them potato chips.. I asked for dipping sauce 2 times and for butter and honey for my biscuits and didn't get anything and my mac n cheese wasn't even closed all the way so I had mac all over the bottom of the bag... WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN Please Please Please do not go here!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a KFC in years, but I'm pregnant & had a craving for it. I visited this location on my way home from work. First, the parking lot & drive-thru are both extremely small. Which makes getting in & out a little scary, especially during rush hour. I ordered the 8 Piece Bucket Meal + an additional side of Potato Wedges. It was an extra 5 minute wait for the wedges, which was totally fine with me because fries have been one of my main cravings. The staff were efficient but not very friendly. The food was steaming hot & seemed fresh so that was great! But they forgot the biscuits that were supposed to come with it. I didn't notice until I was home & by then I had absolutely no motivation to drive back. Luckily what I ordered was more than enough for just my husband & I. This pregnant lady's craving is now satisfied & I don't plan on coming back here anytime in the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"I never ever place a review but the service that i just experienced was horrible. I work with the public so I'm very sympathetic to service workers. The public is rude & many times can beat a person down. Yet the young gal that attempted to serve us was downright rude. No thank you, no attempt of basic customer service. I left mid order since her service was so bad. This location must train there workers how to treat customers."}
{"text":"I just came back from trying kfc fairly new grilled chicken.Well my timing was bad 5 pm .It was very busy and i had to wait about 40 minutes for my order of grilled chicken. I am not going to mention the side dishes i had because they were normal (what you get from kfc)side dishes.I am a big fan of there chicken.Well i should say there regular chicken.The grilled chicken was two star at most. It was very greasy and not much flavor .It would be nice if they at least put bbq sauce on it.On saying that i still am a fan of kfc just not the grilled chicken."}
{"text":"Ewwww first off at the speaker it smelled so bad then i get \"welcome to kfc\" she sounded irritated so i place my order pull up to the window and for 4 min no one came to the window but we can see them it's ok i can wait. But don't make me wait to get watered down mash potatoes and dry chicken the looked like it was taken out the trash. Which in fact was what the chicken tasted like trash. I'm just so irritated. Why does a billon dollar franchise let managers and employees get away with doing unfaithful things to the very people who spend their money to make the business stay alive? Coming to this kfc was like getting in a van with a stranger , you don't know if your gonna get kidnapped or raped!"}
{"text":"I truly can't believe that KFC has gotten so bad over the years. It's been years since I have eaten at a KFC. Last time I ate at the one that was located on Rainbow between Sahara and Charleston, I got food poisoning. That was years ago. So being in the mood and willing to give them another try, I visited the West Charleston Location. Wow! Disgusting! The service was good, but the food was horrible. The gravy on the mashed potatoes was solidified and didn't compare to years past. The potatoes themselves were dry and powdery. The Cole Slaw was actually the best thing we had there. The chicken was greasy and didn't compare to years past. The Mac & Cheese was horrible! Some of the worst I've ever had. The Ranch dressing was again the worst I've had. The place was very dirty and messy. The outside lights were left off and it was night time which made it difficult to know if they were even open. I'm sure that will be the last time for me going to what used to be a high quality restaurant."}
{"text":"Came on football Sunday went in to order since drive thru was around the building only had 1 person inside in front of me so I figured wouldn't take long but boy was I wrong! Everything I ordered was already made but still took over 20 minutes before I got my order and got home late for game and missing part of my order! Horrible slow service at this KFC. The gentleman in front of me said he come once a week and they never have the same people always new employees working ."}
{"text":"It's a convenient location right beside the Walmart and Scotia Bank. A Keele bus stop right outside. The cashiers here are friendly. The food is just typical KFC, just like all the others. There is a Taco Bell attached."}
{"text":"If i could give this place 0 stars i would. I love kfc but this one in particular is TERRIBLE. So heres my story. I came in tonight and went inside because the line was 10 cars to long. All i ordered was 2 plain chicken littles only, There was a kid being trained and i understand being new, but come on he almost gave me the amount i paid back.. then the girl training him asked if he wanted to make my order. So he went to put gloves on mind me he didnt wash his hands. As hes making the sandwiches he take about 5 minutes. He puts mayo and pickles so knoing this when given the bag i ask if they're plain, he says \"no i put mayo on them.\" I then said its suppose to be plain. So he goes back starts another 2. After another 5 or so minutes of waiting for him to put bread and chicken together we leave. I get home to find the chicken smaller than the bread... Are you kidding me i paid 3.95 for something my 2 year old niece wouldnt get full off of. Also there was only 2 people wearing gloves out of about 6. I tried to call the number on the recipt, not in service  went online to get the number, same number... I dont know what to do at this point i was craving this and its been over an hour and i havnt even eaten it yet... Dont go here unless you want poorly handled food, and small amounts of it."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for over a year and all these crap reviews surprised me! 

This location is my favorite, yeah sometimes they are out of things but the people are friendly have never once had anyone be rude to me in the drive thru and if they are out of something they always try and make it right offering other items and even extra and free items."}
{"text":"I've noticed that kfc is really starting to go downhill lately. It all started when they took the BBQ chicken sandwich off the menu and replaced it with a deluxe sandwich. Then they stopped selling mountain dew. Kfc was one of the only fast food chains where you could get mountain dew but now that it's off the menu I have to drink root beer when I go there and it's not really the same. And half the time the soda doesn't mix right with the corn syrup in the fountain so you either get corn syrup sludge or soda water when you buy a fountain drink. I think that they're purposefully trying to give you a bad fountain experience so you'll buy the bottled pop with your meal which costs twice as much. My last complaint is about the ketchup packets and the napkins. You used to be able to take as many as you want but now the old chinese lady working there only lets you have 2 and if you take more than 2 she gives you a dirty look. Do yourself a favor and choose popeyes chicken over kfc"}
{"text":"Friendly helpful employees. The fold was delicious and fast. I read the reviews but decided to give it a try anyways and Im glad i did. It's a fast food restaurant. You can't expect it to be without any flaws at all but it's worth a stop if you're passing through."}
{"text":"Would give a 0 star but no choice for it. Waiting 20 minutes place is dirty. I love ljs but u took all if them out. This is my second time never never never never again."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times and 3 times I had to leave because they were out of something or the service was bad this location also closes earlier than other kfc's wtf!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here on my way home from dropping off a relative.  I walked in the place and saw the condition of the restaurant and decided no.  I looked behind the counter and there was some crumbled white paper on the floor by drive through window.  Then directly behind the counter there two pieces of chicken laying on the floor.  The chicken laying on the floor is what turned me off.  

I might have caught them in a bad time, but it was between 18:00 and 19:00.  

I might stop by and give them a chance.  I understand how things can be at times.  Until then I will give them just one star."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. I didn't know what I wanted (which is not normal for me by the way) and the team member who was working the drive through was very patient and explained my options to me. Food was fantastic as well! Will be back many times."}
{"text":"Tried to order just 2 drumsticks was told he would have to check with his manager because he would get yelled at if he didn't stick to the posted menu. They don't have a # with 2 drumsticks. So we didn't get what we wanted. So ridiculous that you can't order the actual food that they serve at a restaurant. 

I wasn't just ordering those I hade two other meals so he would still be selling other stuff. 

And we have a 20 min wait for the original recipe because the cashier couldn't check to make sure they actually had it available. 

I will most definitely NOT be coming back to this location or recommending it to anyone."}
{"text":"Go to KFC thinking I'll have a great meal,  pay 42 bucks and missing my coleslaw.  I asked the stupid worker Is everything in the bag as they rush me out the drive thru,  of course NOT!  Guess that's why they work there,  no education!  Pay for shit you don't receive!"}
{"text":"I frequent this KFC because it's one of two that are the closest to me. Non-customers are always hanging out in the lobby. They've been out of certain kind of chicken a few times in my experience (ex: they've had to substitute thighs for breasts because they were out, or lack of having original or extra crispy). I give them only 2 stars, but again since the lack of KFC locations in the area I'll always be forced to visit here when I have a craving."}
{"text":"Frequent goer, but only because this is one of the two closest KFC's near me. Once I ordered a bucket of half extra crispy and half original and they gave me all extra crispy. The dine-in area is almost always dirty despite being fully staffed each time I'm there. The employees are young and usually polite."}
{"text":"This poor place looks sad. We were there and they were out of original recipe with seems silly. They took forever to give us our chicken nuggets which also seems ridiculous when ordering at a drive through. Staff seemed burdened even though the place wasn't very busy."}
{"text":"We come here because it's closest to our home. We frequent the drive through.as its quick and easy. This last visit the associate started out with a bad attitude, and I mentioned it to my husband...she may have heard me because when we got to the window she was much better and offered us a free drink while we waited for or bucket. It's nice to see that employees will turn their attitudes around and make things better."}
{"text":"This place is horrible my fam no like kfc my dad warned me not to eat here.but I did the first of all the food was cold and we wanted,ranch for the chicken tenders and they didn't ask us for sauce.and it said on the receipt +sauce we got no sauce I got a pic of the receipt here I recommend not to eat, here also instead of kfc how bout cold kfc."}
{"text":"First 1 star review. Came in at 6:20 on a Tuesday. Completely out of chicken breasts in both original and crispy. None in the cooker. 20 minute wait if I wanted them to cook me one."}
{"text":"Really? Closing the store 15 minutes earlier? Closing time is 11 and by 10:45 you guys ignored me on the drive through? Who runs these places?"}
{"text":"I have literally been waiting in the drive-through line for about 20 minutes now it is almost one I've been here since 1230. It is ridiculous how long it takes them to give you your food. Not just to give you food but to allow you to order. This is the worst drive-through I've been to. a drive-through should be in and out not in wait 30 minutes to be able to order ! definitely not coming again. If you guys are in a rush go elsewhere this is not the place if you have 20 years to spare this is just the place."}
{"text":"Twice the Cottage Grove Road KFC shorted my drive-thru orders, and when I complained to them about it on a later visit they didn't even offer to correct it. Some of the staff barely knows English past the menu items and prices. When I went to the drive-thru today (5-3-15) they said that they were unable to give me a receipt, and that \"it's ok\". I told the cashier that it's not ok to not give some form of receipt upon request, but she replied with only a stare."}
{"text":"live yelp review. i am writing in all caps because it was that bad!!

employee working register told me to hold on to attend drive-thru 
when two other employees were already looking like lost (hush) puppies

friend had to grab his own cup because girl in front blanked out and didn't give it to him.

one employee couldn't even read the order screen (maybe the 
reason why they always f*ck up on orders?!)

waited more than half an hour to get food.

food was cold.

coleslaw was hot. while the chicken was cold .

when i went to get dr. pepper. mr pibb came out!

four different groups of customers, left because of the long john wait.

planned to eat in but was given to-go boxes.

there was food all over the kitchen floor.

couldn't tell the difference between a piece of chicken from a piece of fish.

no utensil were given for my already cold mashed potatoes.

our entire group will never ever come back!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! If I could do a negative star review- I would!
 Rude employee, no food available and according to Mr. No Customer Service (he wouldn't give his name and had no name tag on) the store owner doesn't care enough to put any money into the store for necessary upkeep. There was only one fryer working and no more chicken would be made for the night, but we were welcome to the 1/2 bucket of \"old chicken\" if we wanted it. Umm...no thanks! 
   KFC has lost a lifelong customer although from the sound of things, no one there will care at all."}
{"text":"I live around the corner. ..and dread every time my teenage says...can we go to KFC/Taco Bell. ..
The service is the worst I have ever been to! I will never get the 20+ minutes we were in line...I actually had to download this app so I say something. Please someone hear this...."}
{"text":"What can I say it's KFC. Not too bad, not too good. What a I dislike about KFC is not the greasy chicken rather the lack of attentiveness by the employees. I can deal with food for five dollars, you get what you pay for. At least have your employees do their job. Say hello.make sure there is enough chicken for orders and keep the restaurant clean. This place is a disgusting mess. Dirty tables, trash containers full and no customers..."}
{"text":"I would give zero if I could.

Went to this location two weeks ago. They'd forgotten a cookie or biscuit here and there or gave me the wrong size drink (always smaller than paid for). But two weeks ago, I went through the drive-thru for a kid's meal. They informed me that the kid's meals were out of Capri Suns. Not a big deal, she told me we could order anything else. With lemonade still being healthier than soda, I ordered that. She said, \"That'll be an additional 30 cents.\" to which I said \"You want to charge me when you ran out of the product through no fault of my own?\" She said, \"Yes, we still have to charge you.\" So, I said \"Forget my order.\" and drove off. 

Now, I realize it is only 30 cents, but the food is already sub-par. Does KFC train in customer service? Do they even want business? 

Fast forward to today. I figure I'll give them another chance, two weeks later they can't possibly still be out of Capri Suns, right? Wrong! WHAT A JOKE THIS PLACE IS! I ordered the kid's meal my son wanted, and then I got \"Do you want soda?\" I said \"No.\" She said, \"Okay, let me check to see if there are Capri Suns... ... ...um, is there a soda you want?\" My reply, \"My son doesn't drink soda, so NO. We'll take the Capri Sun.\" She says, \"I'm not in charge of ordering, there are no more Capri Suns.\" 

How is this even possible? Is it teenagers and monkeys running this place? 

I will never again order from this KFC; actually, I may never order from any KFC ever again."}
{"text":"The food here was absolutely disgusting there was no line and I was not greeted for roughly 7 minutes the staff was slow dirty looking and rude did I mentioned the food was also disgusting the chicken sandwich was burnt and cold!"}
{"text":"LIke any other KFC.  I'm not particularly fond of KFCs but the hubby was craving it so we went.  I think if you like KFC then you'd like this one - pretty nice folks.  The tables needed cleaning, however."}
{"text":"Wow. KFC's use to be everywhere, now you have to drive a long way to find one. Worth the drive, love the chicken they make. Wish the one in FH was still here!"}
{"text":"I stopped by for a quick bite to eat last week.  The food was good temperature.  The staff was nice too.  I will come back again.  Just fast food nothing more."}
{"text":"I hate bashing my local eatery, but I have to say it's sad to see KFC go down the tubes like this. Stopped in yesterday for some chicken strips and a small bucket, all of it tasted like old lard and chicken was dry. Fry's marketplace across the street has exceptional chicken that melts in your mouth especially when it comes right out of the pressure fryers. Frys gets a 10 rating, the chicken I had from KFC gets a 2. Too bad."}
{"text":"Just stopped in the drive thru for a quick lunch. Not a good experience. The speaker made loud shrieking noises throughout the order process. I was given fries instead of the coleslaw I ordered. The clerk changed that out but brought back the order in a bag that was now crumpled and greasy. Gross.

On the way out I noticed the diet Pepsi was undrinkable because it was almost all carbonation. Got back to the office and opened up the sandwich. The bun was burned and had dirty grill marks all over it. A piece of fried chicken that had been sitting somewhere for awhile. All dark meat and stringy. Some kind of sauce slopped on. That's it. Coleslaw was the only part that was any good. I'm on my way to the vending machine now to find something to get the taste out.

I usually don't spend this kind of time reviewing a fast food restaurant, but this place is so slipshod it really worries me. If I get food poisoning in the next 24 hours I'll check back in:)"}
{"text":"I was really hoping the management had been paying attention to the past reviews here but apparently they have not.  
The cashier was very friendly but after waiting almost 10 minutes she finally started to take our order but unfortunately she had to explain that they couldn't take out order since they has to fill the orders they already had taken but haven't filled yet and it would be another 10-15 minute wait.
Like I said, the cashier was very nice but the management needs to be replaced immediately."}
{"text":"Very slow service even in the drive thru won't be coming back to this place anymore and I even went inside to the KFC and still very slow at getting food out"}
{"text":"I was a walk-in, the ONLY customer, no one in drive through. 
Ordered 3 piece meal. TWO servers in front of me. One ringing up order, one to pack. I repeated order to packer. Asked for breast, leg and thigh; got wing instead of thigh. 
Asked for mashed potatoes, hot coleslaw. Really? How stoned were they?"}
{"text":"Don't think there's a KFC in Oakville? Think again! This little location is hidden out of the way and you need to know it's there (or be going to one of the nearby shops) to find it! (The sound barriers even block it from view from the highway.)

The menu is standard for a KFC. Lots and lots of parking. Small dining area (this is really meant for takeout only). No waiting behind someone before I could place my order. Really, if you want to bring KFC home for a meal, this place is the ticket."}
{"text":"Yep, like I guessed, my order was wrong.  I received a leg and thigh instead of the tenders in my box.   Two stars for the taste of their Georgia Gold honey mustard BBQ  but 0 for not having enough extra crispy pieces to fill our 20 pce order box.  We were told, they were done and there would be no more extra crispy pieces for the rest of the night!  It was 7:30pm and they are open until 10:00pm.  The lady behind us, who ordered extra crispy chicken was disappointed as well."}
{"text":"Hi: The Colnel's chicken is great no matter what negitivity is being put out there I practiacally grew up with the kfc brand..for they were the goto place if wanted pre prepared fried chicken..There is only one thing.. What happend to the potato salad?"}
{"text":"Purchased a large tub of coleslaw and noticed after I paid that the expiration date was yesterday.  I asked the clerk to check the date and he came back and said that the employee who worked the day before mislabeled the tub, but it is ok
I decided to call the store manager after I left, and she said that she informed her staff to check the dates on the products.  Never once did she offer to exchange my old product or apologized.  
Buyer beware!"}
{"text":"Not sure which is worse the fact that I ordered taco bell food and it took 20 minutes to receive ( I went inside) or the fact that one of the kids preparing my food was eating out of my meals...by the time I got my 60 dollars worth of food home it was soggy, tasteless and sticking to the wrappers. Never again. Ps obviously no manager on duty. Food is a mess.."}
{"text":"Low quality chicken, bad customer service. The hoodrat with the tattoos is rude as hell lol"}

{"text":"Very much hit and miss; usually walk away as there is no chicken ready or ran out at dinner time; asked to wait 15-20
Mins for a 2 piece meal - not worth it; lots of other restaurants nearby; 

For the times they have chicken, it's been good; 

Really hit and miss; just be prepared to go to mr sub or harveys and have no expectations from kfc; if they have chicken its a pleasant  surprise."}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars I would!!! STAY AWAY from this location! Not only will they mess up your entire order, they will be rude and STEAL your credit card information! And these people want to be paid 15$/hr!? What a fucking joke! There are cretans that work here, go to any other KFC but this one!"}
{"text":"Are the dinner/night time employees vindictive or something? Why is it every time I ask for extra pickles with my Georgia gold or Nashville hot chicken they not only do NOT give me extra, they give me even less than normal?? Every time we go through the drive thru we have to pull up and wait for our food. The food is great, up to normal KFC standards but come on, fix the customer service aspect!!!!"}
{"text":"Didn't get our biscuits AND grilled chicken tasted dry and over salted.  Fried chicken was extremely dry."}
{"text":"Real nice, friendly service !!  Chicken strips were ok...a little dry...."}
{"text":"Made us wait 6 min to order.., then 10 min for food. Dining room was disgusting! Food on every surface. I will not be navy to this location."}
{"text":"This location does not have good service. Went through drive-through and they forgot our drinks and our sides. While they were preparing what they forgot, we could see another girl who had her back to us and it was obvious that she was on her phone. Any other KFC would be better."}
{"text":"Is silverware , napkins, wiping down the cup, and the cookie that comes with my meal that hard to get ? Oh and no receipt either ...... guess I'll live without my cookie that I paid for but it would be nice to eat my food but now instead I have to drive somewhere to get silverware and a napkin to wipe down my cup. Oh and don't let the older guy take your order ... he will ask you to repeat three times at the speaker and then again at the window."}
{"text":"I've never been more frustrated in my life.... let's not forget to mention that I just got off work from a 12 hour shift and all I wanted was KFC. I repeated my order to the order taker 3 times because they kept telling me to hold on or I'll be right with you in the middle of my order, like why ask \"what can we get for you today\" and then tell me to hold on in the middle of my order? Also the older lady who was working at the window charged for a large meal and told me a completely different total then what I was told at the drive thru speaker ....... after she tried to give me a large drink I explained that the price was wrong and I will not accept a large drink being i'm pregnant and can't drink a lot of soda ... she still tried to give it to me and charge me extra ..... so of course I got upset and told her to change the price that I did NOT order a large meal , the famous bowl comes with a medium drink. She argued with me then yelled for her shift leader to come over and said I was yelling at her ....... rude, because yes I was but not loudly I just raised my voice out of frustration ... he gave me a dollar back but kept my receipt (probably because he didn't want me to do the survey or call and complain) .... well after that I never even ended up with a drink..... I had to go inside for it ... only to have the shift lead and the old lady talking crap about me while I was standing right there ..... so of course I said something and told them they were rude and needed to work on their customer service, the manager said okay bye . And that was it .... I'm so frustrated , like how is this place even open still with the reviews on here?!"}
{"text":"Original recipe mixed white and dark meat
Bucket purchased. Noticeably smaller sized
pieces. Taste, recipe and service unchanged.
Hungry crew will need to order more."}
{"text":"So I was here to grab some food to go after work; I didn't know but they're cleaning up, getting ready to wind down to close. I ordered wings to go, and the nice young man said it'll be a 10 minute wait and offered me a complimentary soda. I felt that was very thoughtful. When my food was ready, the young lady behind the counter apologized for the wait. She had a wonderful smile, and I didn't feel so bad for holding them up. The service was excellent. I hope KFC acknowledge these wonderful people"}
{"text":"Disgusting old burnt chicken. Don't go to that KFC. Indian School and 75 ave better. Wow"}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken tender meal that was supposed to come with 6 different sauces and they did not include them. I had to wait over 5 min for my food because they did not have the tenders ready. I am ok with that because at least they were cooked fresh. On the plus side the staff was friendly and the food was good just missing the sauce."}
{"text":"So many issues with service.  The food was OK, but all the times I went there, they'd forget to give me things.  Knife and fork, butter, a straw for my drink.  It's always something.  How hard can that be??  I love chicken and love their chicken strips, but come on, when I order a drink, I need a straw.  When I order Mac and cheese, I need a utensil.  

No problem with the food...so if you go into the restaurant where you can get your own utensils and straws, it might be just fine, but I hate getting burned at the drive through.  Holding a cup of Mac and cheese with nothing to eat it with is very depressing."}
{"text":"We have tried this location a few times now. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. They fail to add the biscuits. This location must have an excess of biscuits due to never giving the customers the biscuits that come with THEIR family meals! I asked the guy SEVERAL TIMES- \"Is everything in the bags??\" \"Are you SURE everything is in the bags???\" 

Furthermore- 2 additional sides comes to $15 extra?!?! Someone is pocketing some extra money!"}
{"text":"extremely unhygenic toilets both mens and women's. just wondering how the kitchen would be !
service is  very slow."}
{"text":"Came here to redeem a $5 coupon from corporate for a very poor previous experience when we went inside last time & this time Totally lacking on customer service. How do you leave the drive thru window completely open & walk by the driver sitting in the car and not say hello?! To sit there for 4 to 5 minutes without so much as a hello, go away or kiss my a** is totally rude. Plus they made one of items wrong! Are you kidding me. Come on get your stuff together. And just a tip.....completely unsafe to leave the drive thru window open.


I wonder if corporate realizes that out of all of their KFCs out here none of them are above a 2 1/2  rating on Yelp. That should be a humongous red flag for corporate."}
{"text":"Always cheap with their sauces and I never mind paying for extra, but when your service is poor and I pay extra for what other places freely give... 

Was told after ordering and paying that my 20 wings would take 10 minutes to cook. Fine. Can't do much about that now, can we? So they reluctantly and with hesitation went to cook the wings. Then we can only have 2 ranch sauces with our order. 2 sauces? No \"sorry\", no \"thank you for your patience\". Wish they never closed the other location on Sahara."}
{"text":"I hate to review KFC & Taco Bell because, honestly, I think they are bottom of the chain when it comes to fast good chains. 

The food is consistent, tastes like every other KFC food & Taco Bell. The staff are friendly and service was pretty fast. 

I got take-out and brought it home for the family and it was still hot when I got home. The restaurant from everything k could see appeared to be clean."}
{"text":"Believe the other reviews. This KFC absolutely blows. Couldn't even get a chicken breast because they \"ran out.\" Hey, owner - your management is incompetent and driving customers away. Also the place is filthy and staffed by lazy kids who don't give s*it."}
{"text":"I use to love this KFC, until today, when I ate half of a chicken little before realizing it was raw! You guys can get someone seriously sick like this!"}
{"text":"This place is dirty and the employees are lazy. This is my least favorite KFC around."}
{"text":"Just needed a quick bite to eat, we didn't make it inside but the associate working the drive thru may have been having a bad day, she didn't say much to us and at the window when we asked for ketchup she seemed annoyed. 

The food was \"meh\"...the chicken was warm...but the worse part was the cold potato wedges...ugh in my opinion this is one of the best items at KFC! Those yummy seasoned potato wedges complete the meal! But cold potatoes whether fries, or wedges are just plain gross! So that was very disappointing! 

Not the best experience I've ever had!"}
{"text":"First off they never have chicken ready around dinner time ever and today I went to get there 20 dollar fill up deal and they say they don't have chicken breasts in original or crispy . Seriously this place needs new management or something cause everytime I come here there always something wrong that's why I don't come here very often anymore"}
{"text":"The food here is fine, whether it be the KFC menu or the Taco Bell menu. However, I always feel sorry for the staff. This location always seems to be understaffed.  There are far too few folks taking the orders, preparing the food, and then bringing the orders to the counter.  The shift leader is always apologizing to the customers for the slow service."}
{"text":"Fucking disgusting. Have not been to KFC in years and was in the mood for some chicken; this place is nearest to my home so stopped and got some, got home, opened it up, dubiously took one bite and threw it out. Tasted old and it was covered in grease.  It was fucking disgusting.  Do not go to this place!!  I can't believe it is passes Health inspections..Fucking disgusting."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY! Wish I could give this place ZERO stars. They have the worst customer service and it's filthy! Ordered two meals from the Long John Silver menu. The cashier didnt have the courtesy to let us know that the meals we ordered didn't come with drinks. So after she disappered to the back for over 5 mins my husband stands back in line with a gentlemen thats already been waiting to place his order. Upon getting our food they gave us ONE tarter sauce packet... Really? We both ordered fish, my husband asks if he could have more while looking at the manager and she just smiles. The place had food on the floor and on the seats of the booths, the trays that they serve the food on looked as if they haven't been cleaned in weeks. Wish I read the reviews before we decided to go here."}
{"text":"Horrible service no Ice in the soda fountain. All the carbonation was out. Took forever to take my order, they're more concerned blabing in spanish to a guy looking for a job as a cook then taking my order."}
{"text":"Wow, what a sh!tshow. Understaffed, focused on Drivethru... Missing things, they were out of stuff, and instead of telling us, they just didn't include it."}
{"text":"Every time I go here my order is wrong. It took 12 mins to get 2 Items in the drive through. Really!?"}
{"text":"Horrible have came here twice, gave me about 3/4  of my order the first time. The next time we were told that it would be 20 minutes for a 3 pc of chicken and we said we would wait then after we paid a lady in the back yelled at us they still might not have any chicken even after the twenty minutes"}
{"text":"So let's just start by saying if your going to eat at this specific KFC go through the drive thru because it is not worth goin inside.
We walked in and the restraunt was very hot and had a wierd odor. No employees were to be found anywhere, my family and I were standing at the counter for about 6 mins before someone even said hello. We ordered 2 of the 5$ fill up boxes and a KFC bowl. One box was suppose to have mash pats with no gravy, a buscuit, a drink and a cookie. We got pat wedges instead of mash pats and no cookie. The second box was exactly the same except with gravy. We got everything except a cookie. The bowl was great! But before we could even eat we had to ask an employee or a towel to clean the table because NO tables what so ever were
Clean. The floors had trash everywhere and the condiment station was completely empty. After we were done eating I had to ask for a box and the employee that helped me was on her personal cell phone having a conversation while talking/ helping me. 

All in all it wasn't good service at all, messy, hot and not Recommended for dine in eating!"}
{"text":"Once and a while we get a hankering for KFC.  And every time we smack ourselves and promise to never do it again!  But we did.....

Crispy bucket - they forgot one breast (of the extra we paid for) and did not offer to discount the cost.  Meat was so hard it was not edible and the remaining 5 pieces were garbage bound. 

Their large grave is not the large cup, it is half the size.

Mac and cheese - a really funky taste.

Spuds were so salty they also ended up feeding the local landfill.

Note to self, if has gone downhill for 3 years......try something else."}
{"text":"I am changing my review to 5 stars - this location is now very clean and has excellent service.  Funny, with it being all clean and all you can't hardly get in as it is usually very crowded.  Great job KFC Riggs Road staff!  I'll be back next week!"}
{"text":"Horrible. The entire order was wrong. The mashed potatoes were packed dumped over in the box so the whole meal was ruined. We didn't get a single sauce I asked for. We didn't even get straws! I tried to call the store so they could correct the order but they didn't even bother to pick up."}
{"text":"You can't ever change your youth, therefore the hubby and I used to like a bucket of KFC (and then that dublicious sandwich they came up with) every now and again.  Well, this location changed that craving.  Dirty, dried out, etc."}
{"text":"I didn't wait long to get my order and the pickup window attendant was super sweet. I gave the hot chicken a shot and I enjoyed it. I went expecting a bad experience based on some reviews and left pleasantly surprised. I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"The chicken was dry with hardly any meat on it, not tasty at all, terrible French fries...Everything tasted and looked reheated...Never again..."}
{"text":"Filthy mess, they should be ashamed, but it doesn't look like they care. They forgot to install the ends on the soda machine, and it sprayed us all over. They did not even apologize. The machine is also dripping water and pooling on the floor. There was old water stagnant and dirty under the seating area. The floor was filthy all over. I used the front door mat to wipe my shoes before I left the restaurant, not the other way around. Worst KFC I have seen, and I travel a lot."}
{"text":"Come on guys! Trust me, I am all about the fight for better wages, I think overall the people in this country are severely underpaid, all kinds of jobs. But, don't give the fight a bad name! We were missing our two potatoes and coleslaw, and one of the pieces of chicken is less than 2 inches in size. Just moved to the area, so now we know- check your bags before driving away. Now dinner is delayed for all, the chicken is getting cold, and I hope they didn't give my husband any trouble at the drive through to get the missing items."}
{"text":"I have visited this location several times and am tired of being disappointed. Either the food comes out cold, takes over twenty minutes in the drive thru, or they don't answer the drive thru at all. Had this location give the wrong order on more than one occasion. Arrived at their drive thru 15 minutes before it was scheduled to close, employees were still inside, refused to answer or even advise that they had closed early. Can't believe that a place that is never busy can take over 20 minutes to provide food in a drive thru. Skip this terrible service and go to Canes, Popeyes, anywhere but here."}
{"text":"Took my daughter and granddaughter to get them some dinner before taking them home. Sat waiting at the drive thru speaker for over 10 minutes. Only To have the woman come on and say oh I didn't know you were waiting to order. I'm my mind I'm thinking just blow it off and order. I start to order their food only to have her interrupt me to tell me they have NO CHICKEN!! Um you think you could put a sign outside letting customers know that your fryers are down and are unable to serve buckets of chicken? Not everyone wants chicken Little's."}
{"text":"I can't actually say much about the service, the chicken, anything like that. All I can say is that I tried to order two pieces of spicy fried chicken--a breast and a thigh--at the drive thru window. 

\"That will be $9.23,\" the man said.

\"Um.\"

I sped off. 

Now, this was not for two pieces and a drink and a side. Nope. Two pieces, a biscuit, and a dollop of cole slaw. 

On what planet are the KFC people living? I can go down the block to LoLo's and get two actual good pieces of chicken and a waffle for $8 bucks. 

If they ever decide to lower the prices to fast-food level, I'll try it. Until then, I'll pass!"}
{"text":"Good Food, very very very dirty place is sad, to see the employed just don't care for the place, i have to wait 20 min for chicken breast because they have nothing cook at 7pm :-/"}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for family meal. That is unacceptable, if they can't provide what you order then they shouldn't take our money."}
{"text":"I bought the original recipe tonight. I order for thighs & breast only. 12 pieces &  1 chicken pot pie. the employee is nice but the chicken taste weird. IT TASTE BITTER!!!!! IT'S HORRIBLE!!!!
I don't know what they put on the chicken. I feel like I am getting sick now."}
{"text":"Not as good as I remember KFC. Been going to this chain since the early 1960's. This particular store would probably not make the Colonel proud. It looks dumpy inside. The furniture worn out. No paper towel dispensers anywhere. Filthy windows. 
The person at the register got my change wrong. Then she had to translate my order into spanish for a kid behind the counter. Then some crabby lady stood at the counter because her drive-up order wasn't ready when the thought it should be, so I had to listen to her complain out loud (Probably former New Yorker). I don't think I'll be going back.

One trick I have learned about eating at KFC, is they will not tell you when you order if what you ordered is \"in stock\" or not. So you need to ask BEFORE you hand over any money for them to see if what you are ordering is available now. Once you hand over the cash if you decided to eat elsewhere they will not refund your money after it gets into the drawer.

On my most recent visit they were allowing a homeless guy to sit next to the door with his guitar and luggage, blocking the sidewalk, and begging for money. This is a huge dis-incentive to going here."}
{"text":"Super slow service, they NEVER get the order correct,  the staff isnt the friendliest... with all the other options close to here, pick some place else!"}
{"text":"Absolute worst KFC I have been to.  Always out of something during busiest time. Ordered $5 two piece meal...on a Monday..after 7:00pm....waited 15 minutes and the manager ask me if I had ordered..wtf!!!!.  Then received two small..overcooked pieces that looked like they may have come from the throw out bin...this is by far the worst operated franchise in the area...but I got my ."}
{"text":"This KFC is holding on, stopped in and everything was hot and tasty as KFC should be. Went through drive thru and was quick. Nice to see they are getting back to the old days!"}
{"text":"Locked dining room doors at 820. Eating dinner and guests still trying to come and dine-in."}
{"text":"Every time I order chicken wings the wings are broken. Broken as if the chicken had an injury. Does the restaurant pay less for broken-legged chicken? Even the legs sometimes have dark red spots on the leg like the chicken's leg was bruised. This location on 29 almost makes me want to stop eating chicken...the thought of eating abused chicken sickens me."}
{"text":"We had takeout from KFC tonight.  Horrible - chicken greasy and cold.  For what you pay it is a rip off!  The original recipe use to be good - what happened - Colonel Sanders must be rolling over in his grave."}
{"text":"Well I was going to a picnic I stopped for a bucket of chicken.  I paid for 25 pc bucket ok chicken. I got to my picnic with a big bucket which was half full and only had 8 pc of chicken thanks KFC for wasting my money.  Every time I go to a KFC they forget something. Like some sides or that I paid extra to get extra breasts. Apparently they can't tell the different between legs and breast. I can understand if it happened once but it is every time I go to KFC. I won't be going any more."}
{"text":"I would very much rather go to KFC when I want chicken, than to any other chicken place. However them not having biscuits at 630pm is unacceptable. The biscuits are the best part. Highly disappointed, get it together guys!!"}
{"text":"I had eaten KFC in the past and been reasonably impressed with the tastiness of the grilled chicken . We had a dinner party at our house scheduled for tonight at 5 p.m. We thought that we would use the grilled chicken as part of the main course. A week ago, we came in to speak to the manager, Jose. We explained to him that we would need 30 pieces of chicken, half grilled breasts and half grilled theighs. We scheduled a pick up at 4:45 p.m. \"No problem\" he said. An hour before, I called to make sure that the order would be ready. \"No problem\" they said. I got to the store at 4:30 just to be safe. Jose reassured me \"No problem\", my order would be out at 4:45 and piping hot. At about 5 o'clock a young man came out from the back and asked me if drumsticks would be ok instead of some of the thighs. No, not really! I finally was able to leave the store with my order at about 10 after 5, late for my own party.
The take-home lesson: even if you really like KFC, don't count on them for catering."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner at the drive thru and waited for about ten minutes which gave me enough time to look at reviews. For the majority of what people said about waiting, it's true. As the lady in front of me ordered I heard them say they were out of what she wanted, which is also what people said in reviews. Finally able to pull up to order and was told he will be with me in a moment. After waiting a longer time, I decided to not wait anymore and possibly be disappointed with my choices, if they have it in stock so I was able to drive off with the opening that finally became available."}
{"text":"I'm only giving 1 star because its not possible to give a zero star rating. This is officially the last time I go to this location. I have never had a good experience and yet because its convenient, i somehow come back but after my last experience here, thats it. It shocks me how incredibly rude and disrespectful the staff in this whole building is, and thats including the manager! Its disgusting to me that I literally come here as a paying customer just to be disresected as much as I have been. On top of that, I've never been here and left with everything I paid for, there is always something missing or something wrong. I may be only one person, but the company I work for makes large purchases here as well for our meetings and I guarantee they wont be anymore. What a disgrace of an establishment."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool location. The entrance from the street is down a huge hill, into the parking lot and drive thru. But there are plenty of parking spaces once you make it down. And since the location is relatively \"new\" from the outside it looks clean and well kept.  

I haven't been inside yet, so this review is strictly based on the drive thru.

My experience was great!  I already knew what I wanted so it didn't take me long to order. I keep it simple with a two piece-white meat with potato wedges and corm. The cashier was very perky and upbeat. When I arrived at the window, she was just smiling and had an excellent attitude. It's so rare to find perky, happy people at the drive thru windows. So that definitely made my visit!  To top it off my order was hot and prepared correctly, and of course it tasted great. 

A bonus for this location is that they have a lunch buffet! I will have to make sure I check it out one day!"}
{"text":"Horrible I went there tonight! Waited in drive thru for about 10-15 minutes .
Ordered 2 orders of mash potatoes and gravy and 6 biscuits....
I asked if everything was in the bag and honey and butter she said oh I got you.

Needless to say I spend 12 bucks on 6 biscuits one thing of potatoes and gravy. 

Called to tell me he fumbled with the phone then questioned someone because I wanted to talk to a manager. Then said oh I'll put them on hold, told me they would be with me in a minute . I waited 5 because they never put me on hold just put phone down.

The line has been busy for 26 minutes to call back"}
{"text":"The food was ok but once again they shorted me part of my order. It was supposed  to come with 3 sides I had 2 when I got home.  Last time I went to KFC I ordered a 25 PC bucket to take to a picnic 20 miles away I get there that  big bucket had 8 PC.  This place is just ridiculous.  I am done.  What a waste of money!  I will not waste any more of my money there."}
{"text":"I would like to know if the people who work here know what comes in a meal. I have never received an order correctly from any KfC ever.  Just ridiculous. Everyone makes mistakes but every time. This is the last time I will go here. I'm done."}
{"text":"So my wife loves the chicken pot pies from here, so I decide to stop on the way home from work. What a mistake, I walk in and one of the girls is flirting with a guy that had a cheese cake factory work short on, and never even acknowledge that I was there, now I was standing right next to him. So I ask her if I could place an order, and her lover who doesn't work there tells me, the girl that will take my order went to throw the trash. She should have taken him with her and thrown him in there too. So lover girl calls another guy, who comes up with an attitude, and just stared at me for a second then asks me what I would like. Two chicken pot pies please, he looks at me with a blank stare, then asks me if I want to wait, we don't have any right now, it'll take about twenty five minutes. Being frustrated with the whole ordeal, I just walked out and vowed never to return!!
I have to leave one star, but wish I had the option of not leaving one at all!!!!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't going to even bother to write anything but since this was my first job when I was 16, I feel obligated in hopes that the owners will take more pride in this restaurant.   I only went in to order a drink and had to use the restroom.   It was disgusting.   Feces all over the toilets.  Huge rust stains in the toilets and it stunk like poison that pest control companies use.   I don't even want to imagine how the kitchen looks.  I mentioned it to the young boy at the register and he apologized and stated that he would let the manager know.  If the manager actually cared, the restroom would have never gotten to the point of the toilets crusted with rust rings."}
{"text":"I have not eaten at a KFC in quite some time and don't know that I will be back anytime soon.  This location was VERY hot! It appeared the air conditioning was not on nor working properly.  There were flies flying all around and all of the tables looked like they had not been cleaned all day.  While the people who were working seemed nice, I had to ask for napkins, a straw, and ketchup because they weren't anywhere to be seen.   I know KFC is a fast food restaurant but I expected it to be cleaner than it was!"}
{"text":"The food was terrible! I asked for original, got back to work and it was the driest crunchiest piece of chicken I've ever had. The mashed potatoes were cold and my biscuit was hard"}
{"text":"I had a bad experience last night when I used the drive thru , kfc was out of biscuits ! May not be a big deal but the problem was when they asked me to wait for 10 minutes for fresh biscuits , I agreed but I never thought it was actually going to take 27 minutes!! Really bad service and the manager wouldn't even come talk to me ... Will never eat at this location again"}
{"text":"This location keeps running out of things in the middle of the day and doesn't tell you.  The drive thru has been a slow disaster the last three times I've tried here.  

The last time I went (today), they sent the person taking our order home right in the middle of the transaction and the new person had to figure out our order from scratch.  So we sat there for fifteen minutes haggling again because they didn't have half of what we ordered - no dark meat - and it was only 8pm.  And they balked at giving us a refund for what they couldn't deliver on.

I felt bad for the new person standing there trying to deal with what was happening inside the store.  It was a bit of a fiasco.  So I am going to give them some time to fix their problems before I go back to this one."}
{"text":"I'm being generous with the 3 star.  First time we went there and as soon as we walked in there 3 people together at the counter and not happy with their order.  Should have taken it as a warning. 
We were up next and the guy at the counter says we just got slammed and I'll be right back.  We watched him with 3 customers at the drive thru and then he came back.
Asked him if they had extra crispy.  He said yes then looked and yelled back to someone and they said no but he will put some on and be ready in 20 minutes.  I hear this constant from other KFC so if it's that popular keep it made!  This is fast food and it was about 6p.m. the dinner hour!
From the other reviews and the disappointing cold popcorn chicken we got and out of sauce, I think it's poor training (the guy just stared at me when I said I'll have the same thing that my adult son ordered).  There was like a 2 minute pause before I said, what's the total?  He said the price for one and when I looked confused he finally says oh you wanted 2!  He stared at me the whole 2 minutes and didn't get it???"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service ! Always such friendly workers when I go through the drive thru. Smiling and kind . It's so so nice.   Makes me smile too ;)"}
{"text":"I do not understand the bad reviews. I normally would not go but I saw a fake review complain about their burger.... at KFC uh huh ok. The guy in the drive thru was super nice the food was fresh and good"}
{"text":"I would give this KFC zero stars if I could.  15 minutes standing at the front of the line waiting to just place my order.  Another 20 to get it all the while they continuously served the drive thru customers.  This is the WORST KFC in the Phoenix metro area hands down.  Not the employees fault, BAD management.  Avoid at all costs...."}
{"text":"I was there on my lunch hour with 2 of my coworkers. We waited in line for 15 minutes and only 1 of us ordered because they were so busy. It was 2 ladies working during lunch rush hour!!! They were giving out wrong orders to everyone. It all took
FOREVER. We decided to leave. My coworker got a refund."}
{"text":"This place is awful. The floors are dirty and the staff is so rude. I bought a sandwich that had lettuce on it and the lettuce had dirt on it!  DIRT. When k asked to speak with a manager I was given attitude. Then the manager literally said \"what do you want me to do about it? \"
1 star?  How about negative -100 stars? YUK!!!!!"}
{"text":"Along with everyone else that gave a bad rating and wrote a nasty review this location SUCKS!! The employees suck, the food sucks, the potions are awful, the inside is cold as hell and the employees suck!!! Seriously if you hate what you do go home!! 

Wrote to Corp about the inside being 45 degrees and received zero response nothing nada. In an area where food choices are abundant this miserable kfc needs to re-train the staff have the managers take courses on customer relations and then have the owner step in and do some serious QC and QA. 

Chicken and sides are simple keep it that way people!!!"}
{"text":"The most biggest crispy chicken breast I have ever seen! Although there were areas where there was excess batter, it was cooked all the way through. Service in the drive through was excellent. They offered a better deal than the fill up box. Very happy with this experience all around."}
{"text":"This is the worst location I have ever had the misfortune to visit in any city.  For the third time -- I know....shame on me for letting them do this to me more than once -- they were without adequate product to sell to customers.  After telling us that there would be fresh extra crispy chicken to fill our order in 12 minutes -- and after having us wait for 20 -- they were forced to admit that they didn't have enough chicken breasts available to sell, period.  On a Sunday afternoon, at 5:00 p.m., they were already out of chicken with no prospects of getting more?  Who runs a business like this?  Chicken is all they sell!  It wasn't just a bad day, either.  This happens over and over at this location.  

After having spent 30 minutes waiting, they refunded our money and we went to another chicken place in Scottsdale, one that takes care of and values their customers.  I'll never step foot in another KFC again.  Not any of them.  There are plenty of great options, but KFC is not one of them."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill. Now I understand why I had seen a gentleman shouting at the employees for their incompetence the last time I came.

I ordered the usual small popcorn chicken and they claimed you can only buy a size large at this location. Weird.. I went to pay at the window and all of a sudden, from the many times I've came here and paid by Amex, they tell me they don't accept Amex. The worst part is, the employee was new and barely spoke English.

After that when I got my order, she only gave ONE sauce for a size LARGE. I had to come into the store and be one of those people who ask to speak to their management because the lady serving me was clearly incompetent and lacked common sense. That's when you know it's time to change up my designated KFC location."}
{"text":"As much as I love KFC, this store is very disappointing.  In the drive-through I didn't get a receipt and they only gave me half my order.  Luckily the manager was nice and helped me sort things out when I drove back and went inside.  She admitted things weren't going smoothly that day.  But make sure you get a receipt and check your orders before you leave!  Colonel Sanders definitely wouldn't approve of the level of service here."}
{"text":"Please dont go to the KFC on NT in front of Walmart ...save your $$$ the staff is slow...didnt know how to ring a special up an had a sign 4 a 8 piece special outside .... told me 20 min wait ..I got to the window an the food was ready .. had to get the manager to fix the receipt ... only to get home an chicken old ... order wrong ...This my last time going to this KFC I hope it close down an they don't make anybody sic with that old greasy food"}
{"text":"I have never seen and won't see a ruder employee than I see in this KFC!! Never come here!"}
{"text":"Perhaps the cleanest and nicest KFC I have ever been in. Just off HWY 321  Dallas, NC. Easy parking. Very courteous employees. Fresh and delicious food."}
{"text":"FIrst of all everything that I ordered they were out of .. Chicken ?? How in the hell can you be out of chicken when that is what you sell ?????? Not only that but after I made 5 different changes to my order to accomodate the 3 things they had anything of, they still got my order wrong and put whatever they wanted in my bag.,. Was not happy !!!!"}
{"text":"Bad customer service & no chicken strips or popcorn chicken . So why are they open ? How is this place still in business ?"}
{"text":"Ordered online, got given a 40 minute time frame for delivery. At the 50 minute mark, I called the store and was told my order had been delivered, when it hadn't. The lady who took my call told me she would contact the driver and call me back. When she called back she told me it was going to be another 15 minutes. Needless to say I was not happy. When I got my order it wasn't fresh or hot. Never ordering from there again."}
{"text":"Worst KFC ever. Two women employees having a loud argument about the amount of chicken they should cook. Woman at register hardly spoke English. And they charge 50 cents for ranch!!! I took my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at KFC today. Main reason being that they paid special attention to my two children. A great way to win me over is through my kids. Thank you. The gentleman that came out and offered my children cookies was very kind. The food:  chicken pot pie, Mac & cheese & popcorn chicken were also very good. We'll be back"}
{"text":"Slow. Like... SLOW. And unapologetic about it. They somehow managed to misplace our order or something so when the people who were behind us got their food, we asked. Oops, we will get that out to you. Fifteen minutes later... food. No apologies... nothing. They seriously just don't care."}
{"text":"Never again!  I just spent $32 on a 12 piece family meal which consisted of 7 legs (yes, 7!! -- my family doesn't even eat legs!),1 breast, and 4 other pieces that I think were chicken, but it was hard to tell through all the breading and fat!  Whatever happened to the standard three pieces of each part - leg, wing, thigh, breast???  Along with that came semi warm mashed potatos and ice cold gravy, three day old biscuits and hard over cooked potato wedges, which I'm pretty sure were nuked in the microwave at some point.  And to think I was pleasantly surprised when I placed my order that they actually had chicken ready...because, as we all know, KFC never has chicken ready when you order it!  Don't bother spending your money here."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever at a KFC. Food was terrible and they said they only give out condiments 1 for each meal and to get more you have to pay .25/each. What BS is that at a fast food joint?  Clearly no one goes here dead restaurant. Owner or manager terrible as well as the RUDE cashier. I'm contacting their corporate office. I only go to KFC for my 2 toddlers and usually have great service at all southwest locations. Recently moved to this side and wanted to try and I regret I came to this sh*%# hole."}
{"text":"I didn't know this place would be too cheap to not give me any eating tools for my pot pie and famous bowl. I also got 2 biscuits and they only gave me one butter. I had asked for hot sauce for my bowl and only received one hot sauce packet. 

Not a huge deal but come on KFC, seriously?

And I forgot to mention, it took like 10 minutes to just get my order, and another 10 to pay. It wasn't even busy. I saw like 4 employees and that was only what I could see through the drive thru window."}
{"text":"My father wanted hot wings from KFC for Father's Day.  Last minute.  Around dinner time.  For whatever reason, it's always difficult lately to get hot wings from KFC.  I dreaded the wait that I'd be facing (or worse - that there wouldn't be any available) but things went much smoother than I thought they would.  

The cashier working that day was friendly (a little shy) and efficient.  I asked for 20 hot wings and was informed that, at the time, they only had 15.  It was close enough for me.  I took them.  

The cashier was great at handling my weird order of hot wings, biscuits, and cole slaw (can I get a \"Complicated order!\" a la Bon Qui Qui?). 

I prefer this location over the one on Losee - it just feels a little safer to me.  Although, I've never been at night so I can't attest to what it's like then.  All in all, this place wasn't too terrible."}
{"text":"We like KFC but for years and years this particular KFC has been one of the worst in the area.  Maybe they don't do enough volume.  Maybe it's the owners.  But I wish we had a better chicken restaurant in Westlake."}
{"text":"Everything was GREAT!!!
I love the origional recipe fried chicken and biscuits!"}
{"text":"restaurant #D212091

muy mala experiencia es la tercera vez que cambian lo que pido y me dan lo que les parece a ellos pero esta vez la revice antes de irme ya que habia pedido 12 piezas de carne oscura y me habian puesto alas y cuando reclame parecian perros furiosos y me querian cobrar $2.00 dolares mas cuando el cobro extra es por pecugas 
mi ticket es el #3341 a las 2.10 pm
ya les digo cuidado no los merdan los empleados

{"text":"Maybe it's me, but I've had the worst luck with customer service at EVERY KFC I go to.. Hawaii was a joke, but I can't figure out what location it was to write a review! 
Anyways, this KFC is probably the next worst with customer service. This little brunette woman was the worst! I had to repeat my order like 5 times and I could hear her laughing and talking with another employee through the speaker so she kept having to ask me \"what was that?\" with a rude attitude. I finally pulled up to the window to place my order face to face. She then went to repeat my order that I just told her, and things were still wrong! Seriously?! At least my finally correct order was edible. 1 star for service and 2 stars for the food.. #blah"}
{"text":"Zero stars would be better. Went through the drive thru with only 2 cars ahead. Ordered our food and even had the lady repeat the order.  32 minutes later I  arrived at the window. The lady had my order completely wrong(which explains the long wait; everyone's order must have been incorrect) and got an attitude when I corrected her. Asked for  condiments and received none. Cole slaw was extremely  dry. Bread was hard. Will NEVER go back here. Something  needs to be done. People want a pay increase but are incompetent - can't take a simple order. SMH"}
{"text":"The best KFC I've ever been to! The service was quick and the employees are very friendly and helpful. The restaurant is clean and the food was great! They also have incentives for visiting them. I was very pleased with my experience today. I will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly and efficient. I didn't have to wait long and my lunch was prepared and served. The manager even upgraded my mac and cheese to a large(I mean who doesn't want more Mac and Cheese)"}
{"text":"This hole-in-the-wall KFC only does take-out.  My last experience with them wasn't so great as it took them a while to cook the food first.  After getting the order and returning to where I was staying, I wasn't too impress with the overall look and taste of the meal.  The fries were undercook and stuck in big clumps together.  The chicken was still very greasy and still had light pink on the breast and thighs.  The cheesecake I got was still frozen long after I ate what I was able to eat of the food.  No plans to go back in the future."}
{"text":"This has to be the slowest location I have ever visited. Though the counter staff was polite, they seem to be under staffed and without direction. Ever time a visit this location it seems to take 20 minutes to get food."}
{"text":"I don't go to KFC very often and it's shows obviously why. If you get a bucket of chicken you get what I called \"parakeet size\" drumsticks. I remember when the bucket of chicken was very huge because the chicken quality was also huge. What KFC is doing today is ripping people off with the small pieces. I also asked for extra crispy at the Drive up but when I got to the restaurant window they said they were out of it and I have to settle with original recipe."}
{"text":"I'm voting passionately that this may be my least favorite KFC in the city by far. I always get their spicy chicken wings and every time no matter what time  of the day I come to this location there is always a 10 minute wait on the wings. So this time I happen to ask the nice young lady at the drive through as to why this is? I asked her if it is always a cook to order and why they never have any in stock. She replied \"after 7pm we don't and it's cook to order\" I asked if this is posted anywhere and she replied it's the general rule.  Well...thank you again KFC for making it such a pleasurable experience. I hope they open a \"Popeyes\" in Aliante soon!!!  

\"Still waiting for those wings up front in a parking space\" -Joe-"}
{"text":"Pros: 
-Tasty Tasty Tacobell. 
-Open late
-Freestyle drink station 
-Close to my house and sells tacos till late

Cons
-Everything else
-sloppy service (check if you get them tacos fresco light)
-Patrons who are as high as weather balloons
-A KFC with no chicken, just sandwiches!!!!
-mucho ass crack from patrons and not just the ladies across the street at the brass rail"}
{"text":"Waited ten minutes to be greeted at the window, with an apathetic tone. Waited another ten minutes for my food. With a \"here you go\". No apology, no smile. They acted like I was inconveniencing them for being there. 
Then a couple of days later I order two sides, and both were wrong when I got home."}
{"text":"Their chicken is almost never fresh and when you ask for fresh, the people in the back get attitude. They also try and give you tiny pieces of chicken and pass them as tenders and get annoyed if you mention that to them. Only a few decent employees, the rest are crap. Need to improve food quality"}
{"text":"Decided to go through the drive thru today and never expected to sit for 40 minutes, 20 of which was spent at the order speaker waiting for someone to take my order. Once I was able to place my order the total came out to $8.95 and another 20 minute wait. Customer service was definitely lacking, the drive thru associate didn't give me a receipt even when asked. Food was decent, but the staff needs to go back and do Customer Service Training. Will not return"}
{"text":"Went to go buy hot wings and devastated that they no longer make them. I got chicken strips and potato wedges instead and unfortunately all I can taste is old oil. Couldn't taste the chicken at all. I will never come back"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and disappointed again they got rid of their chicken wings. So I tried the Nashville Hot chicken strips. They aren't bad but I don't understand why they are so greasy. Nobody else has fried chicken this greasy.  I'm officially a Popeye's Chicken guy now."}
{"text":"If you want FAST food, don't go here

I arrived at 6:42 pm, there were 3 people in line before me. Laura took my order at 7:03 and the food was provided at 7:21.

40 min to get take out chick from a chicken place"}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst KFC I have every been to!!! I live down the street and every single time I have gone it's been a disaster. When I complained to the manager she had the nerve to yell at me and say \"Well what do you want me to do\". It makes me so sad to see no one cares"}
{"text":"Never heard employees use the F word so many times before during a transaction, not even caring that I am right there. Did not receive a receipt, did not receive my complete order, and they had to ask me what my order was several times because they kept having issues despite only ordering a meal and a side. For the behavior and language alone, I won't be back."}
{"text":"If you do happen to go here don't get the food to go like I did.  I ordered 4 wings and 4 breasts (paying extra mind you).  I know what a chicken breast is supposed to look like and whatever they gave me was a far cry from the what I expected.  If they were from chickens, the poor birds were born horribly deformed and mutated.  A complete waste of money.  I wouldn't put it past this place to substitute chicken beaks, feet or necks if the situation dictated."}
{"text":"Stopped in this week for some Nashville Chicken, which was really spicy (which is good). Also was pleasantly surprised how friendly the staff was to everyone who came in even making recommendations and giving food descriptions which I thought was going above and beyond for fast food."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Rude individuals.  They locked the doors before the business was closed so they wouldn't have to deal with complaints!"}
{"text":"By far the worst KFC ever. After several bad visits, tonight was the final straw. I ordered strips and wedges for two and a pot pie in the drive through and was advised there would be a 14 minute wait for strips. I then ordered two zingers and a pot pie instead. Upon waiting for three cars in front of me, I arrive at the window and am told there would be a 15 minute wait since they have no pot pies. Every time I visit there is something wrong either bad staff or lack of food. This will be the last time since there are many other places to eat in the area."}
{"text":"Awful quality.  Poor staff.  Pass this location.  Prices at KFC are getting outrageous.  I am done with KFC."}
{"text":"Stopped after soccer with a starving kid.  

This is by far the worst KFC on the planet. 
Rubbery disgusting tasting chicken tenders.  Poor service.  Dirty.  

We should have stayed on the road to our tried and true KFC in Madison on Mineral Point Road."}
{"text":"Posting a photo that should speak for itself.  Registered a complaint.  Got a call from a very indignant gentleman at corporate (or an owner, was at work and couldn't talk long) offering me a new order of wings.  So I guess corporate has a sense of humor.  They're just completely lacking respect for their customers.  Who doesn't want fried feathers attached to their chicken?"}
{"text":"This is the worst KFC every time I go their always out of food. Today no mashed potatoes or wings. Last time I went here, they was out of wings and I was told 15mins on any order. Never again, I tired twice"}
{"text":"Heard about their Chicken Pot, Chicken Pot Pie!  Actually, not too bad for KFC. Had a craving for something like this. Pretty tasty, but, only as a snack. Pretty small portion. Had to have a chicken little with potato wedges just satisfy my appetite.

Restaurant appears to be clean and neat. Service was just meahhh. Plenty of parking in surrounding lot. Nice life size Colonel sitting by the door watching everyone coming in. Got my fix for now, probably won't be back for a year or so."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst experience I've had with fast food EVER! I rarely eat fast food but in this particular day I was in a hurry and I stopped here on my way back to work. The drive-thru was pretty standard no concerns with the customer service. 

When I returned back to work I pulled a hot wing out of my box and proceeded to eat. After about to chews I felt something by my chin and I assumed it was a piece of lent or something. I wiped my chin and felt something going across it. I immediately noticed it was a hair. I instantly spit the food in my hand and pulled out the longest piece of hair I've ever seen in anyone's food. I was sooooo disgusted! I left the hair in the box and called the store location. I spoke with a manager by the name of Kevin. I explained to him what I discovered and he went on to say that the hot wings are frozen. I told him that doesn't stop hair from.landing on them and being fried. He offered to replace the meal and I told him it wouldn't be today but I'd definitely return. 

I returned 3 days later (today) in lunch and pulled in the drive thru and told another manager what the situation was. He asked me for the managers name and I didn't have it on me. I went back to my job (right behind KFC) retrieved the information from my desk and returned, this time going inside. 

The inside wasn't clean at all and the soda machine was not working. I brought to the workers attention you may need to change the filter bc it was really flat and she said yea I know. Well don't you think you should have a sign up stating out of order? Any who, after showing the other supervisor my proof and also my call log my meal was finally replaced. He told me Kevin didn't write me name down as he told me he did. 

After waiting over 10 minutes I finally got my meal and vowed to myself I would take time out to share this review."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst KFC I have ever been too. The service was incredibly slow.  I ordered a snack cup with popcorn chicken and potato wedges, there were about 3 popcorn chicken the wedges were cold and stale and they squeezed my two orders of food into one box instead of in individual boxes. I love kfc and have never had bad food like I did here. I will not return to this kfc location in the future."}
{"text":"There's no disguising that KFC is gross in its taste and inhumane practices. I don't understand the appeal of crunchy chicken skin that stretches off the meat like third degree burns, but my husband seems to like it so I go. As a restaurant chain they don't even try to make the experience appealing. During Christmas time they actually duct-taped decorations up on the wall. Duct tape! The one and only reason I keep returning to this KFC is because of the employee Aphrodite. There is something about this woman that I love. First off, her name is Aphrodite! How can you hate on someone with that name? Secondly, I feel like I could make a movie about her life. I'd make her win the lottery just so she could burn KFC to the ground and piss on its ashes. Then she'd whisk off to Greece and have a life similar to that of 'Under the Tuscan Sun', except less boring and with more Danielle Steele action."}
{"text":"I changed my mind on my order, and I work in retail so I hate when customers do that to me, but the manager was very quick to change my order. The staff was very polite. What more can I ask for?!?"}
{"text":"Horrible service and will never come back to this location ever again. We waited 15 minutes for our food and then it wasn't even correct so I had to ask for my missing items. In fact I am still waiting on my hush puppies."}
{"text":"Update your hours! Drove 15 mins to location to find out it was closed when site shows they open til 11pm"}
{"text":"After a while they did a great renovation and make the space more comfortable but it's still KFC for deep fried chicken lovers."}
{"text":"The chicken here is not my favorite because they are too dried and hard, the only chicken I may eat is grilled chicken. I stopped by and tried out one time for chicken, I don't think I come back here for more chicken, maybe someday I might come here for some grilled chickens! 
I am not very and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Every single time I come to this location my food is messed up without a doubt! I always tell myself I'm not going to come back here yet here I am again tonight placing a large order, pull away and I am missing two potato wedges and a coleslaw that I paid for! I hate having to go back through the drive-through or get out of my car and go inside to get my order corrected meanwhile the rest of my food is getting cold. Really wish there was some type of quality control ensuring that people are getting all of their food before they pull away!"}
{"text":"UNHAPPY. Drive thru service was great. My chicken strips and biscuit are definitely nowhere near fresh & Dr. Pepper and coke are clearly out but I didn't know this until I got home! What an unfortunate visit."}
{"text":"I have in general been pleased with this location. Every time I go here the food is good and the service is prompt. Although every so often one must wait for grilled chicken"}
{"text":"Worse KFC ever!!! Drive through takes forever they only do one car at a time a each car takes about 5-6 minutes. Service is horrible. The inside is filthy. And there phone is disconnected so you can call to complain. 

Today they have someone who has a very strong accent over a horrible speaker so you can't understand anything she says. 

Don't waste your time as it will take a lot of it if you do."}
{"text":"Slowest drive-thru I've ever experienced. I just left after sitting in line for 10 minutes without moving. These guys need to get it together!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve one star but I want to post a review. This place is nasty dirty and the thing working the drive through looks like madea. never go there I'm telling you ya gotta believe me. This is my first review and I felt I had let everyone know how bad this place is. And this place stinks."}
{"text":"This KFC location is just for take out. There's no seating inside, but i'm pretty glad about that, because if i had to stay in there longer that the 5 mins i have to wait for my order then i'd get pretty depressed. Sad old wallpaper, half of the counter is empty. 
But whatever, I don't come here for the atmosphere. I come here for the chicken. And it's good. Fried chicken goodness. You usually have to wait a few minutes for your food. But i'd rather wait a few mins for hot, fresh fried food, than chicken that's been sitting around under those heat lamps. 
So every once in a while, if you're craving the Colonels secret recipe, indulge ;)"}
{"text":"Tasted like poop here.  No customer service...and then nothing but disrespect.  F*^? KFC"}
{"text":"I very rarely eat fast food, but I was craving some crunchy chicken goodness, with a biscuit and slaw. The only think awesome about the place? SPORKS (why haven't they ever become mainstream, the world may never know)! They were OUT of biscuits and dropped my change onto the pavement without offering to make it right. They may be right down the street from me... but I will be sure to stick to local mom and pop shops going forward."}
{"text":"Don't go there ever again!!! I ordered chicken tenders and one of them were not fully cooked!!! What is worse is that I had to wait like for 20 minutes for them to give me my order!!!"}
{"text":"Incredibly slow. And after being incredibly slow they'll get your order wrong after you reiterated your order at the window. The entire while they stand behind the window chatting."}
{"text":"KFC Boneless at Westlake April 2013 - KFC and other companies spend a lot of money advertising new products.  Especially when they have introduced a new item. I had the boneless chicken at KFC today, and it was served to me luke warm. The very friendly server placed the chicken on the counter where it sat for about 3 1/2 minutes while she prepared the rest of my order. The product did not taste good at room temperature. All that money spent on advertising to get me in and it was not good. The manager walked by several times ..joking with the staff building morale. He failed to notice my food getting cold. Poor execution can destroy a product introduction."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED. The manager better yet, the owner of this location should be reading up on these reviews to fix these issues because every review is the same. We pulled in to the drive-thru at 8:45, waited to order until 9:00 with 4 other cars in front of us, and then waited another 20 MINUTES TO EVEN PAY. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?!? I'm appalled and will never return to this location. The cashiers are rude, don't listen, and my god again, how freaking long does it take to make this stuff??? Are you flying to Idaho and coming back to mash up fresh potatoes? Absolutely ridiculous and a complete joke."}
{"text":"Well had to try the new crispy tenders in the commercials and they actually lived up to the crispy hype. They were very flat and very crispy, but the TN smoky mountain BBQ sauce needed some help. Might want to get an additional sauce for dipping. This deal is 5 bucks for three tenders and a biscuit and side. The mac and cheese here is below average, but you can always count on a good biscuit from KFC."}
{"text":"I have received poor service from this KFC location many times. Ranging from no napkins at the drive-thru (a big pet peeve of mine!), old and/or overdone food to receiving food that I didn't order, and not getting what I DID order!

Today I asked for \"extra\" lettuce on my Twister Wrap with the hopes that I would actually get a decent amount of lettuce. When I got back to the office and opened it, there was not a single shread of lettuce - not even a rogue piece that could have been rolled into the wrap from the counter. (I know... gross!)

$3.50 for 1 tortilla with 2 chicken strips, 2 very small slices of tomato and a little pepper sauce - I can do this (and much better) at home!!!"}
{"text":"I was called last night to follow up on my complaint. No compensation was offered but at least they listened to my issue. I have to give HQ credit for the call back."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet from 11am to 3pm for $7.35.  Nice!  Only had two kinds of chicken (roasted and original).  Had a lot of sides.  Nothing special but gets the job done when you are hungry and looking for quick, cheap food.  Since it's close to where I live, I\"ll probably be back, but wouldn't go out of my way for it :)"}
{"text":"Desperate for something healthy in the area, I thought KFC might have some decent grilled chicken. They did not have grilled chicken off the bone, but had the grilled version on the bone. It was decent, maybe supermarket quality, but that is not what they are know for making best obviously. Cole slaw and biscuit do not need a review, but the staff is kinda dumb at this location. My two piece white meal ended up including a thigh and breast. I was in a rush and I would not have eaten the wing anyway, but I thought it was two piece white is two breasts. Oh well, i left my personal message on the table in protest in the form of overturned slaw cup, immature, but effective in teaching a non-verbal lesson."}
{"text":"Damnnnnnn! I'm loving the customer service here. I'm from Los Angeles, and I hate the customer service back home. But....

Here though.... they nice or whayyyyevah. ANA killing it on the customer service game taking people orders inside the store. 

The other employees look like they vibe really well and with a good and fun team like that, work is fun and giving customer service while you're happy at work is first nature. 

I didn't get the other girl name who gave me the food, but I love her too for giving me enough hot sauce cause places never do... and believe me, I took it home for my left overs :D

Y'all keep doing what y'all doing."}
{"text":"This place BLOWS!! They NEVER have what you want and there are always excuses. Going to take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Staff is usually nice but they are always out of chicken... 2 hours before they close. They just want to close everything down and leave right at 10pm. Pure laziness"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would!!!! 
First the soda doesn't taste like soda!!! It's almost clear in color! Like couldn't they see that when they filled up the cups?????
We ordered through the drive through.
On one meal we ordered wedges and for mash potato. 
They didn't give us utensils, or honey for the biscuits. Every time we go eat there we notice they are always having fun and talking instead of focusing on the orders .
Never coming back here!!!!!
KFC needs to fix this and get new workers here. Look at all those bad reviews. Ridiculous"}
{"text":"If I could, I would give this KFC zero stars.  I went in this evening and ordered an 8 piece meal, original recipe, with mashed potatoes and cole slaw.  The 3 girls working were more interested visiting with each other than in helping me.  The one who took my order acted like it was an inconvenience to wait on me.  My order was called out and set on the counter.  I had to say excuse me several times before I could get someone's attention to ask for butter and honey.  When I arrived at home, I discovered that I had been given 6 wings and 1 thigh - not even 8 pieces.  I immediately called and asked what is in an 8 piece meal.  I was told 2 breasts, 2 thighs, 2 wings, and 2 drumsticks.  I told the person on the phone what I received and was told to bring it back.  When I arrived and said that I was there to return my order, the 3 girls looked at me and began laughing.  They then grouped up and began talking and laughing and poking at the one who filled my original order.  It was obvious that they knew exactly what they had done.  When I was handed my replacement order, I began to inspect it.  I did not receive all of the pieces that are supposed to be in the order, but I did receive most of them with a few extras.  By the time I got back home, it had been almost an hour and my biscuits were hard and the potatoes were cold.  They sure know how to ruin an evening out.  My advice to you is check your order very carefully if you dare step inside this KFC."}
{"text":"Hey @KFC, I'm convinced that this is the worst KFC in Vegas, if not the world. Look at how many one star reviews this location has! I should have checked with Yelp to spare myself from the horrendous meal I just experienced.

For the record, I don't cheat on my diet often but when I do, I expect it to be both good and worth it. Not too much to ask for I don't think. After trying to go to another restaurant only to find out they were closed due to a family emergency, I wound up here. And now I'm so grossed out so much that I think I'm never coming back.

Don't go to this franchise! Whoever owns this place must be cheap and prefers to scam people instead of doing the right thing. Rather than saying they're out of gravy, they instead presented me with gravy that was the consistency of water and tried to pass that off as the real thing.

May I present you with Exhibit A? https://vine.co/v/MxbPj22t6Pl

Your honor, I rest my case.

As a last resort, I tried it hoping that at least the flavor was still there but unfortunately my gut instinct was correct. Indeed it was watered down gravy along with watered down flavor. Or maybe a disgruntled employee took a whizz in it. Who knows?! All I know is that it was disgusting! My wondering about what I had just ingested ruined my whole meal & appetite for a long time. As a result, I didn't finish eating and threw everything away. A complete waste of money as well as calories!

The manager, Jesus, was unhelpful and didn't seem to care. Overall an awful fast food experience that probably has ruined me for KFC for life. It was so bad that it inspired my very first negative fast food review. Congrats guys... this 1's for you!"}
{"text":"Seriously it's 6:00 and only two cats are here yet I'm pulled from the drive thru because they have no clue Ike's chicken tenders. Losers. Bet they don't even give me a free cookie."}
{"text":"This place is horrible and very poor management. The workers look so lazy and it's the lobby is dirty. This KFC needs to close, there is no point in a kfc that doesn't have good management"}
{"text":"Today I ordered thru the drive thru.  I was placing an order for someone not myself.  The manager or owner was so rude thru the drive thru!  As I was reading off the order, he rushed me to finish up, and talked over me.  I had to ask him to be patient, so he wouldn't keep talking over me.  I'm not sure how the food tasted, like I mentioned I placed the order for someone.  But this did not surprise me.  #getbettersoon"}
{"text":"I love the Chicken Littles.. it's a throwback from 1988.  Back then, Chicken Littles were $.49, were thin and square.  Now they are $2.49, and sort of hot dog shaped.  They actually use a chicken finger and a mini hot dog bun.  The concept is the same, dill pickles and some sort of mayo sauce, fried chicken, and white bread.  A+ to KFC for bringing them back."}
{"text":"I am writing corporate. This is the worst KFC location ever!  If someone from corporate came to this location and tasted the garbage this location puts out it would be shut down."}
{"text":"Slowest \"fast food\" ever. I could be the only person there and it still takes a while. The food is good...service - not so much. Forget going at high peak times!"}
{"text":"Went thru drive thru ordered a 10 piece meal deal mixed, ordered extra biscuits and Mac and cheese.  When I got home after paying 35.00 for this lame excuse for chicken I opened the bucket to find 5 drumsticks, 3 thighs, and 2 wings. Seriously no breasts and 5 drumsticks!  Called to complain about it to Veronica the supposed Mgr on duty. No customer service experience what so ever.  Wanted to know what the problem was and when I told her instead of putting me on hold to find out who made the mistake she started asking her employees in Spanish , little did she know I understood every word she said.  Horrible place will not be eating from here again!"}
{"text":"I just went to this location at 8:30 on a Monday night to get my family dinner. I ordered the family chicken bowl of 12 pieces & they told me they didn't have anything but chicken wings, no breasts. Apparently they didn't \"make any\" nor were going to make it fresh either. They were extremely unhelpful & could care less as to make any. I'm never going here again."}
{"text":"If ur like me and took advantage of that 50% off pizza hut special that ran at the beginning of the year where you got like loaded pizzas for $8 then u is smart.

My belly be suffring tho from all that cheese so came in here to try to gets me some grill chicken, mac n cheese, and slaw.  

Every kfc i no they always be out of grilled chicken ALL THE DAM time so i knows to ask them if its available.  Getting an 8 peace grilled is like finding a red skittles in dog doo.  Lucky you.

Anyways I ask them if they have an 8 piecer bc i no dat they prolly will tell me nah.

Then they said this location dont sell no grilled chicken anymore.  Ever.

Dafuq?????? One star on yo ass.

Got on they website and aint says nothing about that life.

These hoes aint loyal to they menu."}
{"text":"Wish I could rate negative stars!
This food was awful! My popcorn chicken was rock hard! The fries where under cooked. Smh was just really disappointed in them and then ultimately myself for slipping and going to KFC! Never again T_T"}
{"text":"Super friendly service but way too expensive for greasy, shriveled up chicken and not fully cooked biscuits. Green beans and wedges ok. Sorry but three strikes and I'm out. The Colonel is surely turning in his grave."}
{"text":"I have been here since9:06pm.... More interested in chatting and cleaning than my order.... Its NOT busy. They have the sanitizer bucket up ON the food prep area where they are making my food! I took pix.... I may starve soon. Dont know if i want to eat it now either!"}
{"text":"About the same as other locations.   You get what you expect.  Chicken can end up  being a little greasy.  The mashed potatoes and gravy are fake.  prices have gone way up.  Not as a good value as it used to be.  They used to have really good specials but they are rare now.

UPDATE 6-9-16:  They do not honor the coupons in local Entertainment guide even thou the location is listed in the book.  

When asked the clerk said they do not know, I only work here:  WRONG ANSWER!"}
{"text":"This is the WORST KFC I have ever been to in my life.  It should be closed as it is giving KFC a bad name.  I went on Saturday morning at 10:50 AM to the drive thru and ordered a $20 Fill 
Up bucket.  I received it pretty fast as no one else was at the restaurant.(which I now know why)  I went directly home only to find my chicken and biscuits were cold.  This was yesterdays food, NO DOUBT ABOUT IT, and not fresh at all.  The chicken wasn't even luke warm, like they had taken it out of the refrigerator and it had sat under the heating lamps for a few minutes and the biscuits were hard and cold.  The mash potatoes and gravy were very hot like they had just been made and were fresh.  I hate cold chicken and this ruined my whole meal.  THEY ARE SERVING YESTERDAY'S FOOD.  

I filled out the online survey and requested that I be contacted.  Five days later no one has contacted me.  THEY DON'T EVEN CARE, what POOR MANAGEMENT.  At the drive thru I saw a sign posted for the employees that said \"Due to reduced business they were cutting hours and only giving hours to employees that smile.\"   Well do you really have to wonder why  they don't have the business?   How many more incidents of cold food ( and I read other recent ones on here), poor service, etc will it take before the idiots that own and manage this KFC realize how to run a business.  KFC should close this location down as it is giving the entire KFC family a bad name.  

SUMMARY:   HORRIBLE COLD FOOD, HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE BY MANAGEMENT, THIS LOCATION SHOULD BE CLOSED"}
{"text":"OK this might be somewhat harsh but I can only be honest because I am a Chef first and foremost it was 7:30 am in the morning and not one person in the restaurant so it is  not busy at all, there is 3 employees on duty they were very nice and attentive very good customer service but the problem lays in the food the most important part.  I ordered a cup of Tater Babies  and a chicken finger sandwich some special they have for $3.99 the tender tasted like shoe leather and the tater babies were Precooked and came out of a heating unit they tasted like they were made about an hour ago not fresh at all I also ordered a small mac and cheese and a small mash potato with gravy the mac and cheese had dried crust on it from sitting to long and the mash potato with gravy was salty as all hell . The only good item I can recommend is the Apple Turnovers.  What a disgraceful place to go eat your dinner after working a long graveyard shift I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE but if you are in the mood for some great apple turnovers then by all means please do go there they were the bomb and they were fresh . KFC has gone downhill and quite frankly there food really sucks now and its way over priced .......... At least make the food fresh if your going to charge that much for it the CUSTOMER deserves it and there paying A LOT for it ........$35.00 for a 16 piece chicken and that only chicken no sides thats $2.18 per piece of chicken ...That better be some dam good chicken !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I like KFC but this one is a joke. I gave them several tries but they messed up my order every time. There is no one else in the drive through so why do they make you pull forward? I think it is so you have to get out of your car and go inside to make it right. Not only do they not give you everything you order but their buns for the chicken littles are hard as a rock. I work close by and see it is always empty. That should tell you something. And by the way if you sell strips you should stock ranch dressing or at least tell people when they order that you are out of most dipping sauces. Is seems like not only the pitiful employees but also the management have issues. Never going back."}
{"text":"$3.50 Monday Special: Chicken Fried Steak. I was totally bummed that they sold out of the meal by 5:30 pm tonight. We got the Famous Bowl and a 1 Chicken Breast with biscuit and mashed potatoes. When I asked if I could get original recipe chicken. I was told it was only crispy. However, when I started to look for another meal, my server relented and offered me the original recipe.

The Famous Bowl has a bed of mashed potatoes, topped with corn and popcorn chicken and then dowsed with gravy. My daughter craves this dish. 

I have always liked KFC Original seasonings. However, when I eat it, it always seems much saltier than I remembered. I liked my fluffy and soft biscuit with my gravy.

All in all, for under $12, it was an acceptable fast food meal for 2."}
{"text":"Not even an ok experience! First they took my order wrong and were surprised that I didn't want to pay for or accept the items I didn't order. Then they asked me to pull around because my actual order was going to take a long time and I was \"breaking\" the allotted time for an order to be filled. This explains why at the normal lunch rush hour time there is only 3 cars in the parking lot and none in the drive thru. Will not return!"}
{"text":"If I could give a minus star I would. The Chicken pot pie was horrible. It had no chicken in it and the crust was burnt. It had a horrible taste. I will never go to this KFC again. They don't even have the common courtesy to answer their phone when you complain!!!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Had to wait extremely long time to get food. Not sure I would come back to this location. Floor was wet with soda every where."}
{"text":"First time eating KFC in a long time & first time via drive thru. Fast & friendly service was my experience. No honey for biscuits available at this location today tho. Ordered 1/2 extra crispy & 1/2 regular and all was still hot & juicy when I got it to my team meeting!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend and went through the drive thru at 9:10 pm. When we asked for separate orders, the lady told us that it was too late and that we would have to combine the order due to the fact that they closed at 10. Not only did this not make sense AT ALL, but they acted like they were going to close 40 minutes early. It was completely un professional, and to be honest, I was afraid to eat my food because of how sour their attitudes were. Probably will not be back to this location. Oh, and her name was Heather."}
{"text":"If it was possible to get this place zero stars, I would. I've been here a couple times with my boyfriend since we live in the area and it's always been a nice quick and easy snack for us. Until we went today and found bugs in his drink. Went we went in, we stood there for about 10 mins waiting to get the rest of our food we had already paid for. Finally when the girl came up and asked us if we wanted to order something we brought to her attention the bugs. We didn't get an apology, they didn't offer a refund, or anything to substitute for the nasty experience we just had. I will never go back there. Oh and they forgot to put napkins in the bag."}
{"text":"Friday we dined at KFC on Charleston Blvd, Las Vegas, NV and the chicken was tasty hot and crispy.  So on Sunday we ordered 12 piece bucket from the drive-thru and the extra crispy wasn't and the original was undercooked.  We were very disappointed & spent $32.46 for 3 sides, chicken & biscuit, no tea or cookies,sad..,"}
{"text":"I have gone here for lunch many times. It used to be great but the one female manager (bigger woman) barked at me about their own survey thing and just was so nasty and it wasn't even called for. Now that's not my only reason for this review at 1 star but they are hit or miss on quality. One time will be good and the next they will give you baby chicken tender and old popcorn chicken and wedges. It's just to inconsistent. Now the rest of the staff are pretty nice and the one older manager is always very nice. Still I feel that I am done with this location."}
{"text":"Well this place fell off bad.. got my order today staff was rude they forgot my sides small sides the large sides corn was so dry can even eat it. 31.00 for food and very disappointed won't go back.."}
{"text":"Gave this KFC 2 stars only because I go there for lunch and the food is fresh and available at noon. The counter service is zero stars. About every other visit I report the order is for \"here\" and it's handed to me to go. They ask rote questions but fail to listen to questions and answers. Today I was alone at the counter for awhile as usual. The manager, who was right in front of me, finally said I'll be right with you. He wasn't. Instead he was fiddling around with some signs he had collected and looked to be updating the prices. Now these signs can wait.  They aren't going anywhere. Anyone with a clue about customer service knows that you make your money selling stuff, not making folks wait unnecessarily while doing some task that can wait. After a few minutes another employee took my order. She didn't know the correct price or how to ring it up but at least she waited on me. I only got the manager's attention when I asked about the price - only rudely. If this manager is responsible for training it's no surprise this KFC gets the worst review I've ever read. Last week I drove by there at about 8:00 pm or so and it appeared closed despite the closing time here listed at 10. Finally the tables here are never cleared. Today I watched a young couple sitting their diapered infant on the public tabletop while they ate.  They finished and left and I'll bet ya $50 bucks that table was never wiped down before the next unsuspecting customers ate on that surface. I hope that diaper was fresh."}
{"text":"This KFC hires really dirty people, and as a result, they have a really dirty store.  Food takes forever.  You can hear them swearing in the back like they're falling apart in the first $100 of their rush.  Incredible."}
{"text":"Place is run by low energy. I ordered a meal and I sat down for a meal. Nobody in the place and the calm music was playing. Half way through the meal ADS started playing even louder then the music was playing. I asked the manger to switch stations or lower the ads and he refused. 

The chicken tenders were dry, but I ate 2 out of 3 because I was hungry and the vibe was right. 

When the commercials started blaring in my ears for 3 minutes my meal was wrecked.

To make a short story longer, long ago I once had an argument with a Egyptian security guard on a Saturday night in front of 15 people in a hot tub. Rent was 2150 a month and the hot tub closed at 10 and he was a new guy and in his country TEN MEANT TEN. He literally stood there over 15 people and waited for us to get out. We were like ok, give us 15-20 minutes like normal, but the guy didn't know how America works. 

The manager in this KFC tried to mess with my mojo. He is middle eastern and he was probably raised by strict parents first generation over. He made it his mission to NOT GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK, probably because his moral codes are different. I wasn't going to try to argue my point and explain this is America and the customer is always right! 

Over 5 bucks he wanted to get a fight outta me and disturb my peace, so instead I disturbed his.

I got him so mad as I was leaving he pulled off his headphones with a face like he wanted to kill me. Why? 

Well I told him I was going to send a private investigator to his job and he will follow him home and get the names of all his parents and grandparents and send all their names and addresses into ICE to have them deported!

They said I was being racist, but I told them I was being lawful and if you fuck with my mojo, I will fuck with yours TEN fold!

I will update if anything escalates from this situation.

MOE, I know you are reading this. If you want a fight, personal message me and we will do it in private. Can't be fighting in public for 5.50 in chicken. And you got me by 40 pounds, but I can tell it is all chicken fat. I have more gas in my left nut than you have in both lungs. PM me if you want it and you got it.

You got my 5 bucks sir! You stood your ground for the billionaire, Mr. KFC and stole the little guy's money and energy and mojo.

The more you take, the less you have."}
{"text":"The store was dirty. Chicken was one of the worst KFC experience I ever had. And, the staff gave us the wrong bill for our to-go  TWICE. Never go back."}
{"text":"Bad decision!  Extra crispy was not, rolls/biscuits were hard not soft, potatoes normal, gravy cold, tea was day old tasting and Coleslaw was great. Understaffed, no leader and we most likely will not be back. Should have gone to Popeyes."}
{"text":"If I could give them a lower rating, i would. Horrible customer service. Went through the drive thru. When I arrived home, I found my order to be wrong & some of my containers lids weren't closed all the way. I had gravy all over my food. I tried calling the store to get the situation resolved. I kept calling for over 30 mins. when someone would answer the phone, they would hang up. This is no way to treat a customer."}
{"text":"I like KFC but I don't like this location. It is close to my work so that's why I went there for lunch today. I ordered the dip em combo it comes with 3 chicken strips, a biscuit, side and drink for $5. Not too shabby. I also added an extra side of mac and cheese. The slaw was a bit too watery for my liking but everything else was ok. They could improve on the customer service. A smile goes a long way just sayin."}
{"text":"I do enjoy an unhealthy meal from time to time. I like the KFC and Taco Bell combo restaurant. Nothing super special here.

You can order both in one order. It is a standard fast food place. No one is rude or mean here. I don't come often but I wanted a quick taco . The menu is complete with both restaurants foods.

The food was fast and warm when I got it and everyone that speaks to me is very polite.

No complaints here for this restaurant."}

{"text":"Terrible KFC. They have gotten my order wrong 5/6 times and once charged my husband THREE TIMES for the same meal. That was a mess to figure out. It's been a while so we thought we'd try it again this evening. They didn't put one of my sides in the bag AGAIN. I will not ever be patronizing this KFC. Stay away if you want your food given to you correctly!"}
{"text":"So I have an update and here it goes! While I was driving home from work I passed this kfc and one of the workers was trying to cross the road without a cross walk. She decided to call me all sorts of names and flip me off when I didn't come to a stop fast enough for her to illegally cross. This tells me what kind of people work at this place. No wonder my food has been crap not once but twice."}
{"text":"This place has gotten soooo expensive and the portions have gotten even smaller. Wow!"}
{"text":"Although the staff is amazing. This location has chosen to no longer offer grilled chicken. Grilled Chicken is why I came here. This hasty decision by owner/management ends my patronage here... I WON'T be back!!!!"}
{"text":"The location is clean and well maintained.  It is a modern one.  Food was good and order was accurate.  The drink station was out of our one beverage, but we didn't discover it until we got home.  I called to let them know, but all we got was a sorry.  Recommend checking everything before you leave."}
{"text":"They don't  even deserve a star! This place is located in the ghetto, with retarded drive thru plebeians, an ignorant bitch of a mgr, and a punk ass old man faggot mgr.

I told my wife i never wanted to come to this worthless ass place with their nasty food,  always getting the order wrong and workers with nasty attitudes but she wanted  the red velvet cake.

After waiting in the dt for 25 mins i checked the order cause they ALWAYS GET IT WRONG and i wasn't  disappointed. I asked for dark meat only and the first  thing i saw was a soggy breast. They'd  left out my 2nd side.

I go in there and ask for the mgr n proceed to tell this bitch how they messed up my order n she starts rolling her eyes m telling me to lower my voice, which  i did not have raised at that time; and she started talking over me.

The old punk ass male mgr comes from the back, and with out even knowing what the issue was, he sides with her, and there began a huge shouting match. This punk grabs a phone m acted like he was calling the police even though i made no threatening moves nor was o menacing in any way.

Stay clear of this place! The food sucks but the workers are the worse"}
{"text":"Okay, I love fast food. Can't help it. Every once in a while, nothing beats the taste if quick fried chicken.

I love the fried chicken at KFC because of the crunchy exterior and the flavor! It is not as greasy as the chicken from Popeyes. It's got the flavor without making your hands smell like grease for days! Also the option of getting grilled vs. Fried chicken is always good to have!"}
{"text":"We visit this KFC at least  every weekend sometime during the week.
The food isn't that good no tatse and the staff obviously have no taste for thier customer's 
 Four time's I've gotten a mixed up order and every single time I am forced to stand at the counter looking stupid while the wonderful staff walk around look at me like I'm a ghost and ignore the shit outta me!!!!
I honestly had to pinch myself this past Saturday whenever the manger's walked by me for 10 minutes going on about her business to check if I was even still  alive !!!!
I mean seriously that's some straight  BS !!!
After I pulled up a chair after fifteen minutes the customers took notice ,one of the customers repeatedly attempted to get thier attention and it didn't work out.
I finally got enough yelled somebody please for the love of God HELP ME!
I honestly went through hell and back tryna get my mom her potato wedges she ordered !
The only  Bright spot in the entire place is a young man named Eric 
This gentleman honestly takes good care of KFC's customers ,if he sees you standing there he has the  commen Sense and courtsey the other twenty employee staff don't to ask you if he can help you and tells customer's to have a great day!
He's good people.
Hell if he wasn't so gosh darn friendly and  cute as a lil button I honestly wouldn't ever go back into KFC in Monroe again!
I'm totally disrespected and feel like some doggie poo off KFC staff's shoes.
My 77 year old MoMA Love's it I do it all for her.... somebody honestly needs to inform KFC and as I've said before I've written management at least five times they obviously don't give a poo  as they NEVER RESPOND but KFC gonna lose A LOT of thier customer's if they disrespect them by ignoring them and NOT APOLOGIZEING ! Been a faithful customer to KFC 35 year's plus, a huge slap in the face to be treated like animal waste"}
{"text":"We have been dining at this restaurant year's now .They really OVERCHARGE me and my mom
They don't sell coffee anymore mom has to bring hers in this obviously  pisses the staff off so in order to make up for it they charge me $10.00 for my lil three piece  dinner and my mom 77 $8.00 sometimes  they do worse have changed $20.00 x SMDH
Not Good I mean seriously I  honestly can eat a steak dinner for that price it's absolutely freaking insane 
I've written KFC at least five plus time's they honestly don't give a  they NEVER RESPOND!!!!
That's evil when a restaurant you've supported 35 year's plus don't give a damn about thier customer's 
Ahh they kill  innocent chicken's  might as well kill my Pocketbook while they're still it"}
{"text":"Portions are getting smaller and smaller, staff will tell you there out of something because they don't want to cook anything else only want to serve the food sitting under the light.. they also don't follow the hours posted sometimes there closing early and sometimes there opening later.. around the fountain pop machine floor is always sticky... they never have any sauces for the chicken when u buy strips and when they do they charge you .30 cents a sauce with sauce is included everywhere else with certain meals.. this place used to be great but now you pour out $50 for a meal for your family only to get home and be missing stuff u paid for and just feeling hungry again because the boxes aren't even full like they used to be."}
{"text":"Just drove here 2nite in the heat, hungry after working an 8 hour shift. Have a coupon good for 6/9 and 6/10 for customer appreciation day.  It was an 8 piece mix for $8.76. After waiting in the drive thru about 5 minutes, I pull up to the window, the guy looks at the coupon and asks me if Id rather get the 12 pice for legs and thighs. I say no, I want the mixed so I can get some chicken breasts. He said they are all out. Disgusted, I said cancel my order. 

This is not the first time I have been to KFC (not just this one) where I have been told they have no chicken breasts. Maybe its time to switch to Popeye's or Churchs. Pathetic."}
{"text":"In last night .. ordered two $5 Fill Up: 2pc. Drumstick & Thigh, Larger Mashed Potatoes, Biscuit, Cookie, Medium Drink. Cost they charge is $5.50 each and when we got home had no cookies!! Restaurant tables and floor needing cleaning. The soda machine was missing two flavors and looks like it hasn't been cleaned in a very long time. Haven't been here for a long time and will absolutely not return nor recommend anyone to this run down location."}
{"text":"Went here close to closing and the crew was great! Vestor gave awesome service, if he isn't already a manager he definitely should be. And if he is he needs another promotion. Thank you vestor for suprising us with superior customer service!"}
{"text":"They were out of chicken, then proceeded to argue with me as to why i wanted to wait for what i ordered.  Tried to get me to replace what i wanted with what they had already prepared.  Manager on duty was very unprofessional trying to argue and make excuses as to why we should just substitute what was already prepared.  Been going there off and on for five years, after today will no longer go there."}
{"text":"I had not visited this location for many years but decided to have lunch there today. Not a good experience. The first thing I found was that what are being advertised as $5 Fill Ups were actually being sold for $5.50 except for the Zinger which was a \"special\" for $5.00. The lady taking my order did not seem to care whether I was there or not.

The best part of the Zinger meal was the potato wedges which seemed to be about what I remembered. The Zinger sandwich had no zing to it. It was very dry and had very little of whatever sauce they use on it. I added ketchup to give it some flavor and moistness.

Several of the tables and  the floor needed cleaning. Spills near the soda machine needed to be cleaned up. I was pestered by flies. The restaurant was so warm that I could hardly wait to finish eating so that I could leave."}
{"text":"Suppose to be open until 11, but all they have is grilled chicken left. This is the 3rd time I have been told this. Give me a break. I don't go to KFC for grilled chicken. I'm pretty sure it only takes 5-10 minutes to fry some chicken. Someone needs to do a better job managing this location. Also the one time I did get fried chicken from this location.... It tasted old and dry. Thanks for reminding me why we never visit this location."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would, you tell me to pull forward you bring out my order and forget half the stuff the cookies have to be more than a week old and I have no drink to wash down my food with because you forgot it!!! No wonder my area doesn't really have any KFC's because the service sucks. The Manager doesn't even have the common decency to be a polite person! Will never ever eat here again!"}
{"text":"Never coming here again! I should probably let corporate know since the managers don't do anything to change and make this A great experience to every customer. Anyway i went to get some got to the drive thru girl on mic said wait. We waited for a good 10-15 minutes. Finally she comes back on the mic and says are you ready to order, I politely say yes I've been waiting on you she then says I answered you already. I ordered my food as we are paying she gives attitude and then gives me my food. My food came with a drink and she gave me carbonated water instead of sprite. She was so rude I tried calling to complain my phone call was never answered."}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru yesterday afternoon and ordered a 10 piece special. It only took 3-4 minutes for order to be up. I got all the way home and set up on table for my family. The biscuits were hard as rock, literally hockey pucks. The chicken was barely room tempter. I tried calling that KFC at 702-330-5768 five times and a message kept saying that this phone number is no longer taking calls.   REALLY ???????? Then I called another KFC near by and they said that their phone is being charged.  I just dont get it......"}
{"text":"Omg i rarely eat out and the one time i do my entire order is wrong . I asked for a original chicken breast i got a thigh so i took back i got a burnt breast and dry mashed potatoes. I was not bout to waste anymore of my gas  so in an attempt to call the number is Not in service. Aahhhhh... wow and the store was  freezing cold. I will not be giving any stars...i did not get an apaulagy or anything"}
{"text":"We haven't had great luck with the food or service here. Tonight we had really good service but they were out of everything and their credit card machine was ridiculously slow.  The problems here aren't employees but ownership and/or management."}
{"text":"Slow slow slow and ran by a bunch of teenage kids chicken was very dry. Please dont wast your time and $$"}
{"text":"Whoever it was that was working drive thru was literally the sweetest of souls. I literally didn't want to pull out of the parking lot without giving a shout out. It's always nice to be treated with respect and smiles are definitely contagious. The food is good and hot. The order is right. Everything is what it's suppose to be and more! Excellent customer service. I will go out of my way next time I want KFC all bc the precious lady in the drive thru!!"}
{"text":"Never spent a half hour in a drive thru until I came to this KFC. Watched a couple people ahead of me in line had passengers get out of there cars, go inside and order there food and receive it and come back to there car in the drive thru and it was in the same spot. Cashier couldn't hear you over the speaker even if you yelled, and had a chip on her shoulder. All around a bad experience."}
{"text":"Some strange things are happening at this KFC location. The 5$ fill up its 5.25 and the ranch sauce and the honey mustard are invisible!!!! Never go them."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the worst KFC restaurants in the US.  We have gone here for a few years now and the quality of food is one of the worst when compared to other KFC's.  They either have a management issue or no management that cares about the quality of food.  Drive by this one and hope you find a better one."}
{"text":"Never again ! Learn how to speak English before working the drive through !!!! Got my whole order wrong because the lady didn't understand what we were saying... And it wasn't the speaker that was the problem it was the lady not being able to speak English! Never ever coming back here again!"}
{"text":"My Bad- I should know better to peek inside my order before leaving especially when it was processed and put together so fast - that should have been a red flag. I get home to serve dinner for my family and this bucket of chicken was so greasy and looked like it has been sitting under a warming light all afternoon. We won't go back."}
{"text":"The service here is quite terrible. I ordered a 12 piece and it took forever... The kid in the drive thru actually freaked out a bit for a 12 piece."}
{"text":"El peor servicio! El empleado que me atendió por serví carro muy mal educado y con actitud pésima! No compre nada! Y para colmo me saco el dedo!"}
{"text":"This location is filled with idiot people 100% of the time. It's insane. Won't go here anymore because the staff are seriously some of the dumbest individuals I've ever met. Also, extremely f***ing rude. Train your employees better, KFC. I'd give zero stars if possible"}
{"text":"Gave one star because zero stars isn't an option.. worst customer service ever .. pulled up through the drive-thru and it took 4 min for anyone to even answer the speaker to take my order... there was no one else even there .. after she answered, I asked if I could order and if they were still open.. btw it was only 8:30pm.. she replied 'hold up' and came back a couple minutes later and asked 'what you want' ... super ghetto location with lazy employees.. pulled through and went somewhere else.. not sure how they are still open .. food can't be that safe to eat with a staff that doesn't care"}
{"text":"Too bad there aren't 0 stars for this location - went there today and ordered 4 breasts in original - they advised they only had 1 in original and.........had to ask if they had any others and begrudgingly I was told they had 1 in crispy.......so I ask - you only have two breasts in the entire store - no answer and not even an offer that they are or will cook more - it was either take what we got or f--- off and leave.  So I left and will never go back"}
{"text":"The service here is the worst. I am extremely disappointed with this location. So dirty, the trash overflowing, every single table was dirty, I can't even describe the bathroom."}
{"text":"I been coming to this KFC for years and recently they made changes and since then it has gone to shit. Literally.
The last three times came here there was something that went wrong with my order. This last time and for the last time I will ever come here they gave me BRUNT food literally the wings were black and no manager in sight to talk to. How stupid can they be to hand a customer and someone who they know is a regular brunt items.
Last time i ever come here. Worst place ever."}
{"text":"As soon as I arrived in the drive-thru two cars were waiting for food each one took 15 minutes I'm not usually picky about time if the food is good but it tasted like SHIT!!!! the chicken was too salty they didnt even have corn for my famous bowl i had to go home and heat up a can for corn i need COMPENSATION!!!! I wouldn't recommend this KFC my worst enemy."}
{"text":"This is a drive-thru fried chicken restaurant, but I always enjoy it when any experience goes above and beyond.  The girl running the drive-thru was courteous, patient, knowledgeable and funny.  When they didn't have 1 large Mac and Cheese, she offered us 4 small portions.  As we pulled out of the drive, she realized she had left out the biscuits and asked us to pull to the front.  Another employee ran to the front, apologizing profusely and brought the biscuits right to our car.  Hard working employees with great attitudes and the chicken was delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Typical KFC...exactly what you expect. They're pretty flexible about switching out side dishes. I've been to others that don't let you switch out sides. Always good service. No complaints."}
{"text":"Omg i experienced such great service from the workers here. the fries were cold bu then again that could be from the cold weather outside. I enjoyed how friendly they were."}
{"text":"Thankgod they closed this rat trap! My god service was disgusting and food was iffy at best. Always wondered what we were eating the two times i went."}
{"text":"Such great service i was scared what i might walk into seeing how it is located in mckeesport. But service was great."}
{"text":"Service: 48% F Staff is usually rude, and dont seem to care.

Cleanliness: 12% F GROSS looking place. Everything was sticky and greasy to the touch, and there was trash everywhere.

Food: 35% Tasted awful! Dry, cold, and soggy, and made me sick.

This place needs to be shut down in my opinion. With a good scrub, and some employee training, it could be a good resturant. But right now, AVOID this place."}
{"text":"Very rude male cook.  I told him my chicken was overdone snd he said that's perfect.  No customer service w him at all.  Rude."}
{"text":"I went today to get two famous bowls. They gave them to me fast which was surprising. Lately all KFC's make me park & wait for them. I only wish the bowls weren't all sticky on the outside but I understand how messy gravy is"}
{"text":"Very disappointed!  Last 2 times I've been I was very unhappy. A while ago, we did the drive through and the  fried chicken was falling apart and bones inside were broken.  Almost like it was smacked around on the counter.  This last time, we had the grilled, and most of it was very dry and"}
{"text":"I love KFC and this is the closest to my home but the service here is unfortunately not up to par.  Lack of customer service and I much rather drive further to go to another location."}
{"text":"This place seriously is a joke. Ok so I go in with my son for two meals. First they won't take a bill larger than a 20. Really? Ok so the take by debit which I hated using but hey it is what it is. But they have a sign that they would charge you .39 cents for using it. Is that legal? Then it says if over 15.00 you need to sign. My bill 14.48 and he makes me sign? Huh? No line anywhere so he says sign anywhere. So now I feel like a criminal. Then I wait, and wait, and wait some more. As orders after mine start being called and 17 mins pass, I hear the girl say. Oh we don't have any bread for the doubicious chicken sandwich. They disappear. About five mins later I receive my order. Guess they had bread. But not before out right lying to me and telling me they needed to cook a chicken breast. I was standing right there. Not deaf. I cringe whenever my son wants to go here. Glad I dragged his but with me. A thirteen year old waiting 20 plus minutes for a chicken sandwich... Bet he won't ask again. Sad so sad."}
{"text":"Ok. The chicken is KFC \"good,\" but the service here is terrible!! I always have to wait over 10 minutes in the drive thru. And the thing is, even if I complain and complain, nothing gets done. But when my fams wants KFC, I have no choice but to go to this ill serviced place!!!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the worst KFC I have ever been to. I just went and bought a famous bowl and you know what I freakin got!? A BOWL WITH JUST MASHED POTATOES GRAVY AND CHEESE, what the hell. Do not ever go to this KFC you will be very very disappointed. I hope this KFC loses everything they have:)"}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars I would. I sat in the drive-through line for 10 minutes waiting to place my order. When I finally got to place my order, they informed me that, in the middle of dinner rush, they were out of chicken breasts. I waited at the window to pay for an additional 5 minutes before they took my money and asked me to wait in the parking lot. 10 minutes later, the poor cars that piled up behind me were still waiting to place their order. I went inside the restaurant to get my order and there was garbage on the floor of the restaurant, there were open containers all over the counters, there was an employee standing around talking and on top of all of that hassle, when I got home I realized they gave me the wrong order. And then after all of that, I called to find out how I could get credit because I ended up being overcharged for what they actually gave me, I called 3 times and no one answered. There is something seriously wrong with this place."}
{"text":"I will give this KFC 0 stars the good was old and gross. The mash potatoes that they served looked like it's was sitting in the warmer for 12 hours. The gravy was burnt. On top of all that they charge you .39 cents to use a debit card however they run it as a credit card no pin needed. Filed a complaint with the BBB and states attorney generals office and guess what no response from the store.   I had to dispute the charge to my bank to get my money back as the employees including the manager on duty did not know how to process a credit. I will not go to that restaurant again."}
{"text":"Worst service ever . Inside and drive thru .  I had a gift card and they continued saying my card had a zero balance.  I paid cash then called to check balance has $15   .  The boy didn't know how to ring it .  The manager was rude and rolled her eyes when I ask for my cash back and to use the gc.  In the meantime a guy walked up and there was a bug in his soda .  Then they  did nothing but take the cup and gave him a new one .  Didn't report
It to a manager ."}
{"text":"Lightning fast!  This location is always super, super fast and the food is always a good quality.

They keep forgetting the biscuit in the meals or not asking me which dipping sauce I'd like with what I order, so that's a big bump down.  I usually find out after I get home, and since it's not the main part of the meal I don't bother going back.

Still, when it comes to fast food, it's hard to find a place that has good quality and this one is up there.  I'll keep visiting - mostly for my fiancé, not me.  =)"}
{"text":"If I have to repeat my entire order again when I get to the window, what is the point in giving it at the intercom? Maybe they couldn't hear me over the music they had blasting in the background while I was giving my order. They also didn't give me what I ordered, didn't give me a receipt either. Staff at the drive thru isn't very friendly."}
{"text":"Mikie, that's me silly silly me. 

After Showing a home I was told to pick up some chicken on the way home. So the only chicken place on my was KFC. 

I do not like this store but it was supposedly cleaned up since my last disastrous visit. So I figured it must be better, right.... 

So I walk in and there is one guy taking orders. A nice queen of a guy who had all the sweeties, dears and honeys down pat. He did his job well and as I watched seem to do everyone else too. 

I ordered a bucket of twelve pieces with sides. And as it has always been with this store, no chicken ready to go. It will be ten minutes I am told for the breasts to be ready. So I say OK. 27 minutes later I am getting my order. In that wait time they made four orders that no one was waiting for. The other folks that came in after I; had left before me. Each of those orders involved breasts. Finally Mr. queen noticed I was still standing and waiting he gets my order, well tells the girl to pack it up. 

I get home and find one breast in the order. Silly silly me...."}
{"text":"I had a coupon for 9-pieces of KFC with medium fries and a medium salad priced at $19.99.  This mall food outlet was extremely busy at the time, people didn't know where the order line-up was, and some tempers flared.

After placing my order we began hovering and waiting for our order number to be called out.  Customers waiting to place orders mixed in with people like me.  It was CHAOTIC in the Square One Food Court!  Help!!

After 17 minutes had elapsed...I bolted for the mall exit with order in hand.

Food was hot and tasty upon arrival at home.  Would still go back when another deal triggers my KFC spider-sense!"}
{"text":"Don't usually have a problem at this location but then they decided to put a new person on the register with no training, he can't figure out how to ring orders up right and then he doesn't know how to enter the money nor give change. order was wrong and he had no clean and no personality, manager should care and train people at this location!"}
{"text":"We went there yesterday  is so dirty every where the i cant tough  any thing in there , so i have to stand and eat can't sit on the chair so dirty i will won't  come back again"}
{"text":"Got the 10 piece deal several times from this location for my family and the foods Ben fine everytime! Biscuits were soft & fresh chicken was how the Cornial would want it to be served! Way better than the location on Durango & 215. I was disappointed they don't serve grilled chicken tho. Service was ok but I'd keep coming back anyway"}
{"text":"Ordered 12 tenders here and was charged over $26.  The cashier obviously rang the order up wrong and after requesting a partial refund from corporate, I have not had anyone follow-up with me.  This location is very slow to churn out orders and almost always forgets to include cookies in the fill up meals."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love KFC? Everything it's good!
I've been starving for a famous bowl 5 dollar fill up and a chicken little for days, so I finally decided to go get some food to go...
At the first I noticed that they have new flavors on the chicken little so I order 2 and the guy at the drive thru didn't ask for the flavors so I asked for one bbq and on original that it wasn't on the poster, so when I got home my original chicken little literally was a piece of bread  with a tender...there was no mayo and no pickles  so disappointed!!!
Ps. Drive thru speaker was so bad and the guy wasn't paying enough attention to my order, it sounded it was busy cause he asked for some time during my order!"}
{"text":"What happened to you, KFC?? Your recipe no longer tastes the same, then you bring back these \"Popcorn Nuggets\".  It's an old barely visible strip of fossilized fat covered in layers upon layers of \"breading\" that is about as appealing on chewing on glass.  Had to throw them away and I'm p*ssed for wasting my money.  What a freakin disappointment.  There's so much grease in the thighs that it is soggy on the inside and just nauseating.  All you have that's relatively palatable is your mashed potatoes.  You never should've switched colonels."}
{"text":"I rarely eat at KFC, but being that this location is the only one with honey bbq wings, I visit them kind of often. I absolutely love those wings, and the reason why I am giving them 4 stars is for those specifically. Sometimes the staff members move slowly, and don't offer you any specials that are available, but that's rare. The drive thru line here is usually quite long, so patience is needed. Food has always been fresh, and with any other fast food restaurant, check your food before leaving. Just to make sure you are getting what you asked for and paid for."}
{"text":"Worst service in university area. Staff does not pay attention and I have known people who have waited for over 30 minutes in the drive through. I would recommend driving miles before eating at this KFC"}
{"text":"I currently go to UNCC and his KFC/Taco Bell is known for how terrible their service is all over campus. I once waited 40 minutes in the drive thru. There is a TB further away that all my friends and I go to just because of how bad the service is. I will never go back to this location."}
{"text":"I only gave a second star because the side of Mac n cheese I ordered was good, they do however have the slowest drive thru on the planet."}
{"text":"You all know KFC. You should be able to walk into a KFC and know how everything is going to taste. It's cookie-cutter food. That can be a comforting thing.

This has been my neighborhood KFC for about 5 years. Every time I've visited this shop, they're out of what I want. Every single time. My order is simple, two lousy pieces of original dark chicken. Their baseline chicken. The very chicken this chain was built upon. I've never been able to walk in to this store and get it. Ever.

The people are usually friendly, the dining area is usually clean, and the service is fairly quick. They just never seem to have their basic food available upon request.

So tonight I tried their new grilled version. Meh. Plus, the macaroni and cheese chain-wide has at some time changed. I'm not a fan of this new mac/cheese recipe."}
{"text":"Dear owner and especially customers beware.   Your posting in the drive thru with regard to the $5 if you are not given a receipt with your order is a scam and a fraud. We called your manager on this at one of our visits because we were not given a receipt.  We were very rudely handed a gift card. On our next visit we tried to use it. It was handed back to us telling us that it was \"declined\"! We asked for the manager and tried explaining to him but he kept arguing with us. He finally handed us another card assuring us this one was good.  On our last visit we tried using this \"good\" card and again we were immediately and very rudely handed back this \"good\" card telling us it was \"declined\"!  

So if you would like to be treated like scum of the earth and made to feel like a fool go ahead and call them on their \"$5 if not given a receipt.\"  Good luck with that!  

It is quite apparent and sad that the owner of this franchise does not read these reviews or you would think something would be done to correct the many issues creating so many negative reviews!  

Dear owner, if by chance you do read these, either take the sign off your drive thru or have a meeting with your very rude crew and train them on what to do when they do screw up and have to honor the offer so the next customer is maybe treated with some dignity."}
{"text":"Got the wrong pieces in my bucket, thighs instead of breasts!! I was asked three times what I wanted and they still got it wrong.  This was after leaving the KFC on Lake Meade because they had a 40 minute wait for chicken.  I am over KFC"}
{"text":"The chicken was partially dry and sizes were inconsistent. All the good chicken was placed on top, while the scrawny, dry and older chicken was placed hidden on the bottom of our 24 dollar 12 piece bucket. I think the colonel would be dissatisfied with this KFC location. Beware."}
{"text":"If I could go less then one I would. I get to the drive thru and asked if I could get a popcorn nugget combo and she says umm idk I have to check if we have any more popcorn chicken. Then I said I would wait and then she said they had some. I asked if I could get my side changed for a large Mac and cheese she said idk how to do the so no. And then I said ok just a small one and she didn't respond and then said anything else so I ask for my drink and then they don't have my drink. So I'm not happy with my customer experience at all."}
{"text":"Should be 0 star, order 20 pcs hotwing and 2 pcs crispy. They give me 2 piece original instead of crispy and the hotwing where all dry and old.. must be sitting in the heater for awhile. Since this location was new I thought it will be up to a standard. But been given them a few chances already it's like a lottery sometime you get a good batch and most of the time it's dry dry and old."}
{"text":"Over priced chicken that is just ok I remember when the cornel owned KFC back in the late 50s and 60s it was so much better than now. The chicken pieces look like they came from a pigeon they were so small! Go to Albertsons about a mile away 8 large pieces $6.99"}
{"text":"The Colonel would turn in his grave if he saw his likeness attached to this disaster.  They were out of the style chicken we wanted, no problem we said we would take the other style instead of waiting the 18 minutes.  They took my money at drive thru window and disappeared for the next 16 minutes.  I tried to waive someone over then tried to call on the phone but the line was busy.  Finally they brought the food out I asked to speak to the manager. She was having a bad day and once we asked who the area manager was she refunded us the total.  I am glad because the Hot Wings were so old and dry we physically not eat them."}
{"text":"Top notch fast food fried chicken.  I ordered crispy strips and potato wedges.  I asked that they be cooked fresh and that I would be willing to wait.  The cashier was very friendly and more than glad to fulfill my special request.  The food is so good when it is fresh, it makes me think I would be willing to wait for chicken on the bone as well."}
{"text":"Wag of my finger!!This place committed a deadly sin in my opinion...They  charged me for an upgrade which was only1.50 more but then they didn't add the extras into my to go box!
I was there today on 8/23 and the girl at the window was funny and nice but then the other lady screwed up my order. I was the only on in the drive thru! I was in a rush I was in a U-Haul, moving and I must say: even though I skipped breakfast, I found the chicken underwhelming. I haven't had KFC in a while and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"They told me in line I would have to wait 25 minutes for dark meat chicken.... WHY!? Are they gonna kill it first?
Ordered a thigh and it looks like they threw a wing in there only 1/4 of the thigh was edible the entire wing las completely hard the biscuit was still doughy my mashed potatoes and gravy is mostly gravy and the popcorn chicken is entirely hard over cooked pieces of shit.
Decided to give them a shot since it's been years since I had it and tonight reminded me why I don't go there"}
{"text":"It's kfc nothing special it's just a tad bit better then Macdonald and it's the closest  chain to my house. Service is not bad ask for a side of mayonnaise which they did not charge 50 cents for like other places."}
{"text":"20 minutes four sides how does KFC at 5:43 not have sides ready when you know everybody gets off work around this time"}
{"text":"This place is cheating out on chicken. We ordered a two piece meal, paid $8, and got what would otherwise be the thigh cut into two pieces. When we told the staff they just shrugged it off. I'm sure this isn't what KFC is dictating as all other locations we go to have the regular sized pieces. We will not be going to this location again."}
{"text":"cashier did not submit order, waited 45 mins then when complained, shorted 2 meals.
long line of dissatisfied guests. manager no help no offer of guest recovery.
will never again eat at this horrible store that lacks anyone that cares about guest service.
used to be a normal fast food restaurant, visit before a meal order that costs 30 bucks they tried to sell for 50."}
{"text":"I love good fried chicken. You know that juicy steaming bird that you can not put in your face fast enough? 

Well this unfortunately is not it!! I wrote a review a while back about this place and I guess the yelp gods decided to remove it for some reason but oh well. The sad thing is this chain used to be a lot better but seems to be trying to cut corners just to squeeze out a few extra dollars of profit. Little do they realize that people are starting to make or seek out real food.

Speaking of the food here the quality has gone way down. Where they once took pride in what they offered now the focus seems to be on how can we top the double down sandwich? How about replacing dry, over cooked meat that in some cases looked burned and tasted like pure salt?  The biscuits here no longer have that rich butter flavor they used to, instead they were cold and hard like hockey pucks. Seriously is it to much to ask for fresh chicken and food that is hot? I don't think it is. But maybe the coronal just gave up the battle, and moved his troops out of the chicken war. The only problem is we are the ones that have to suffer though nasty fake grilled chicken and brown jello aka gravy.

Not me!! Time to start making my own I guess

R.I.P  KFC"}
{"text":"Worst place ever. Today I had to wait 20 minutes to receive my food. 2 cars were in front of me and the inside part was closed. Then they got my order wrong. I have tried to give them a chance but they mess up every single time. Never ever going here again!"}
{"text":"Well let's see.....ordered (3) piece tender meal.....told it's gonna be a 4 minute wait if I want them....well no, I'm on my lunch hour, so let's go with a chicken breast substitute. Ordered a large diet soda with easy ice and added a side of cole slaw. This stymied the genius working the window and he got the soda wrong. I repeated my entire order and was handed a SMALL drink! He lied right to my face and said it was a large...uh...okay....then comes my order. Just hands me the bag and closes the window. Why yes, I would like honey for my biscuit and ketchup for my potato wedges and a fork to eat my cole slaw with and MY COOKIE!! But...he's gone and I'm just sitting there in my car. I tap on the window several times, saying, \"sir....sir\"....nobody comes. I thrust open the window to the surprise of a young Hispanic girl working the food line. I tell her my dilemma and how nobody was answering my knocking on the window. Stares at me...no apology about the crappy service or forgetting I need a fork to eat or the cookie I paid for....just hands me my items and turns her back on me. Got home with my order, biscuit wasn't cooked through and was nothing but dough. Had to throw it away. This place is pathetic. Won't be back."}
{"text":"So, I walk in to KFC - already savoring my extra crispy chicken - only to find out that the FLIPPING CHICKEN NAZIS HAVE DONE AWAY WITH EXTRA CRISPY!!!!!!  All they have now is original and grilled.  Excuse me - but I don't need the food industry to regulate my diet!!!! It is my inalienable right to clog my arteries.  I am not on any kind of government assisted health care.  I pay my own medical bills - so let's not act like I am abusing the medical care system.  Oh -this just pisses me off.  No more KFC for me.  The end."}
{"text":"FIRE YOUR STAFF HERE AND REPLACE THEM KFC!!! SHAME ON YOU!!!
FOOD is disgusting, covered in oil and soggy batter... $3.99 for a large wedges and they are all super thin and crispy, over cooked!
How can so many reviews be so bad and KFC does nothing? This is the first time i've had KFC in MONTHS and I will not go back, ever, to any of them. CHICK-FIL-A ALL THE WAY!
everyone who works here should be fired"}
{"text":"Ordered KFC because we had some coupons but were so disappointed. We tried changing med salad to large but they don't do that so we had to get 2 more mediums. Switching a 4 piece to all white meat doubled the price. Our estimated $45 order turned into $80+. When we did get our chicken, we realized the ribs were now cut in half of their former size so basically our 18pc was their old 12pc. Won't be ordering from there again."}
{"text":"Terrible service here...Takes forever to get someone to take your order inside, even when there's clearly already a line when I show up. When it came time to fill my drink cups, I didn't see any medium size lids and asked one of the staff members for some. She handed me one even though I had 2 cups and it took another 2-3 min for me to get her attention again. They also have a sign on an empty napkin holder saying that they include napkins with every order, however, when I left with my order I realized that I did not get any napkins or utensils. This location sucks. Rude and slow staff, and no utensils, plates or napkins are included unless you specifically ask for them."}
{"text":"Customer service was poor in this place and chick that works there wouldn't even hardly let us into the restroom even though we were there too order food bad attitudes and no smiles"}
{"text":"Hot wings were great. Not spicy as they could be which was ok for me.

Great temperature

Great customer service"}
{"text":"This one has kfc & Taco Bell combined. 

Had some bad experiences with them. They always forget something or they don't give you fresh chicken, they give you really tiny ones too. 

My dad likes kfc but every time he comes he always complains. I rather go somewhere else to get chicken from. It was dirty when we went inside as well.

My dad likes the original chicken but I like the crispy chicken. 

Also it's so pricey for not good quality."}
{"text":"Called the manager to ask why we got so many legs and so few thighs in the 20-piece dark meat bucket (you'd expect 10 legs and 10 thighs, and legs have 1/3 the meat of a thigh and we have a big family to feed).  She said you get what you get and don't even ask because they don't have time for that.  I said it doesn't say on the menu board that you could get all legs and no thighs, but she confirmed that was the case.  I asked her name and she hung up on me.  Called back twice and she picked up and hung up immediately without answering.  

She was rude, unprofessional, condescending, and abusive.  I've actually never encountered a manager so poorly suited for this kind of job.  I honestly predict this store will be out of business in a month if they don't change managers.  A shockingly inept manager and a truly horrifying experience; we will certainly never go back while she's around.  KFC probably never reads their YELP reviews though.  If they did, they would never have hired this kind of jerk.  Probably hand picked her to whip the customers into submission.  It worked - we're not customers anymore!"}
{"text":"So reading from the other reviews about this location I am seeing a lot of three, two and one stars. 

So I went here today for lunch since I was pretty hungry and needed to get in some good protein. So yes this is a buffet I know a lot of people expect high expectations for a buffet. I went around 2:30ish it wasn't that busy I got in got my plates and cup. First thing I did was take a look at the buffet line to make sure plenty of food left for me to grub on and not having to wait for them to cook more. Now I am not sure if this is something new they were doing but they actually had a worker monitoring the buffet line making sure as people went through it that it was clean and no food drops and making sure it wasn't short on certain items. To me I think that is well deserved and that lets me know that they want us to eat in a clean environment. Is not like a Chinese buffet where u see all kinds of weird things at a buffet line. Now I don't know if this is my brain talking when is hungry but from what I ate it tasted good to me for it being a buffet. So that being said I gave it 4 stars. Maybe I need to go back on a much more busier time and see what happens."}
{"text":"Chicken so greasy that the breading was falling off the chicken and grease laying in the bottom of the bucket. They also charge the same price for all dark meat as a mix of white and dark in the 16 piece bucket. VERY overpriced for legs and thighs."}
{"text":"SLOW!  Seats are torn, semi clean. They never answer the phones if you want to call in an order or need info. Music is too loud, staff can't hear orders correctly. Staff are not friendly."}
{"text":"Friendly cashiers that will greet you and take your order quickly, however, the food took a little while to come out (maybe 10-12 min) but the chicken was fresh, juicy and steaming hot when I received it and that never happens at KFC or most fast food places for that matter! It was definitely worth the wait, especially because the batter was extra crispy and tasty! 

The parking lot seemed a little dark so be careful when coming here at night. Other than that, there was plenty of parking, but they have a drive thru if you don't feel like parking."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of fast food, in fact it grosses me out, but I need something to eat immediately. So I ordered the Chicken Little - Small crunchy chicken breast with some mayo, a couple pickles, and lettuce. It was actually really good. I was surprised. Good quick snack."}
{"text":"Now that they have renovated the place its a lot cleaner than it used to be but its the same old fast food greasy chicken as always.  KFC is pretty much the same no matter where you go.  The problem with this place is how long it takes.  The service is slow.  The second problem is people hanging around in front of the store.  If you like KFC then the food is just like any other location.  And i will say remodeling the store helps but between the vagrants and loiterers, I generally prefer to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The counter staff are unaware of costs or menu items... One employee actual knows a few things - everyone else is just there killing time..."}
{"text":"Excellent location if you aren't hungry for chicken. The is slogan is correct finger licking good because that's all you will have are your fingers to lick, as your doors are open but you don't have any chicken here. Tisk Tisk"}
{"text":"Old dry chicken and gravy had no taste. My favourite thing about KFC is the gravy and it tasted like water."}
{"text":"As a child (along with Burger King), Kentucky Fried Chicken (as it was called then), was my favorite fast food restaurant. You couldn't go wrong with the \"Original Recipe\" (only option back then... it was just called chicken because there was no \"Extra Crispy\") and mashed potatoes.  Sure the coleslaw made me vomit through my nose (just wasn't ready for it then), but Kentucky Fried Chicken was the best.

Years later, \"Extra Crispy\" became available and I realized how hard the \"Original Recipe's\" texture sucked!

Novelty drove me to KFC yesterday.  I went with the white meat combo ... \"Extra Crispy\".  I started with the chicken.  The batter was really caked on.  I forgot haw thick the layers of batter get with KFC.  My initial bite started off satisfying, the flavors helped me relive those great fast foodie moments of my childhood.  From there, the mirage took off.

The batter is caked on so thickly that there is a space between the chicken and the crispy exterior that's moist mush.  It was so disgusting, I could only eat select portions of the batter I knew were crisp.  

The chicken was so far from free-range, it tasted as if were raised in a can.  The breast was moist, but it oddly had the flavor and some of the texture of thigh meat (I can't stand dark meat chicken). 

I went with the wedges.  They are flavored like curly fries, but with twice the seasoning.  The first part of the bite was solid, but the guts of the wedges were a mushy potato with the consistency of mashed potatoes -- yeah, deep-fried mashed potatoes --- %&u% GROSS!

The only thing I finished here was the soda.  I hope in 10 years, when I consider coming back, I read this review and realize some things are best left in childhood."}
{"text":"It's not rare to say that this is not my first visit to KFC. However, this was my first visit to this location. Although this place has low ratings, I didn't find anything that would make me give them a bad rating. Everything seemed to be smooth flowing. The cashier was friendly and helpful. Restaurant looked clean. Food was good. One complaint I do have is that when we got home with the take-out, we pulled out the sides and saw that coleslaw juice was all over the containers. I think just a little more effort in making sure everything was tightly sealed would have went a long way. I think this is what everyone is complaining about: people not doing their jobs. But I can't say this isn't the norm at fast food restaurants. You're not going to these places for the service. (except for Chikfila!)"}
{"text":"Always on the slow side. I'd agree with Sott W. - they just don't seen to figure out how to make it work. They are busy, but not effective at all. It can take quite a while to get your food."}
{"text":"EVERY TIME I go here, the freaking place out of whatever I want to buy.  It does not matter what it is they will be out of it!  It is time for KFC to get some real managers who know how to run a fast food restaurant!"}
{"text":"I been here a few times and they have messed up my order every time LOL it's not that hard to get the sides right really annoyed. The guy didn't seem like he knew what was going on when I ordered sodas he didn't ask what kind and when I told him I wanted a Dr Pepper he was like for what... Lol the two drinks I just ordered that's what."}
{"text":"Not sure why this location has 2 different Yelp reviews, but will put the same thing as the other.  They screw up my order everytime.  Food is ok."}
{"text":"My mom and I recently purchased a bucket of chicken with sides at this KFC for dinner. Needless to say, I wasn't too impressed with the food or service. 

After pulling up to the drive thru window, we ended up having to wait (there was no line) for 3 minutes before the gal working there asked us if we needed help. The food cost us nearly $20.00 for the family meal. When we got home and started eating, I realized that we didn't get any butter for our biscuits. 

Also, the mac and cheese had a weird flavor in it. Almost like it had been sitting for a while or something. I'm not sure. The mashed potatoes weren't very good either, very salty. The chicken, while not terrible, was certainly nothing to write home about. I've experienced better for sure. 

Slow service and below average food for us at this KFC. 2-star place in my view."}
{"text":"My mom went to grab dinner here and the food was  horrible. My mom than told me the ladies there were rude as hell! I told her well the food mated the service. Nasty! She went back to get a refund and they told her they would replace the food. I told her nope! Just get the money back and we can go else where. SMDH. NVR in my life have I've seen such horrible food served! Disgusting!"}
{"text":"First of all, I am not  big a fan of KFC just went in for my daughter, but I have to say wow this is the cleanest KFC I been to!!!"}
{"text":"Twice I've had a terrible experience here...once they told us they were out of breast....second time I went they were suppose to be open til 10:00 and they had shutoff all the lights and the guy was playing on his cell phone.  This place sucks and KFC should just go ahead and close this location!!"}
{"text":"Tried to redeem a coupon from the Entertainment Book at this location. I made sure the coupon said KFC Express. After showing this to the order person she got the manager. He not only almost threw back the coupon at me but would not even do a manager override or special. I responded by taking my money elsewhere in the food court. They were totally unhelpful and apparently they have enough business. I say go elsewhere for a positive snack purchasing experience."}
{"text":"Did the drive up! Had the popcorn chicken! Not too bad, but chicken costs are pretty high!
Service was good and fast!"}
{"text":"If you have ever been to a KFC, you genearlly know what to expect. This was that. The lobby was not very clean and the drink area was a mess. The employee who helped me was fine, but the woman working the drive thru at one point closes the drive thru window and yelled \"I'm so sick of stupid customers!!\". Yjat resulted because the customer in drive thru asked if she could add something to her order, after she got to the pay window. The employee was telling the customer that she could not add anything because she had already begun to take the next person's order. Hmmmm.....  I mean, ok, she closed the door so THAT customer couldn't hear her (at least I think they couldn't), BUT, what about the customers INSIDE the store???? We can hear you.... it's just not cool. 

My food came out fine, so I don't have any other issues. OHHH, I did notice an employee bagging up the cookies without wearing any gloves. Bare hands on cookies from the baking pan to the bag. I thought to myself, that sucks. I mean even dude working with the fries had latex gloves on. Then I left with my $5 meal box, and realized it came with...... a cookie. Nope, I didn't eat it. 

No wonder anytime a Chick Fil A moves in next to a KFC, it's bad news for KFC."}
{"text":"Worst. Service. Ever. 45 minutes in the drive thru only to get the order which was incorrect and Luke warm"}
{"text":"The food is good. It comes up pretty fast. It's about what KFC is priced at slightly expensive compared to other fast food places. The staff is pretty good. 1 visit there was a homeless guy in there asking for food. You're not likely to be bothered in there but it's not in the greatest net with neighborhoods"}
{"text":"Couple of girls behind me called inside and made their friend tell me they were closed. I'm guessing it was over what I'm driving because I had zero interaction with anyone.   Grow up children."}
{"text":"Literally had BEAUTIFUL service 20min ago. Cash register employee was very helpful explaining the deals and had a great smile on even though it was peak time and there was a line. Line was flowing and customer service was calm cool and collect. Great job! A smile goes a long way!"}
{"text":"They always forget things, don't have what you'd like to order, and it takes a long time to get your order. Atleast with late shift people this is always true. Please improve so i can get good chicken again."}
{"text":"Modern day and this kfc will still charge a 39cent fee for using debit card?? Makes no sense. Customer service was great but that was the only downfall"}
{"text":"I went to this store yesterday on my way home from work to grab a bucket of chicken for dinner.  Unfortunately, the chicken I got was very dry.  I went back today and explained to the manager that my chicken was not good.  I received a replacement order that was so good!  And the manager could not have been nicer about my situation.  I appreciate that they made this right for me.  I will continue to use this store."}
{"text":"Ok for those people that say the food sucks and wtever WELL it is fastfood so what more do youu expect for $5 ? ANYWAYS im here on yelp to talk about my customer service experience at the kfc on jones & lakeMead.... I was having an emotional day rolled up to the window, ordered my food, paid for my food, waited 5mins for chicken bites (NoBigDeal) When i got my food the lady at the window \"Jessica\" said here is 3 extra cookie to make youu smile :) it blew my mind that this girl noticed i wasnt having a good day & tried to do something about it when in reality she could have just handed me my order & said NXT but noooo she took the time to see what was going on & she did actually make me smile :) Thankyouu jessica :) i tried calling the store to speak to a manager but they didnt answer so im taking this review to the streets & corp."}
{"text":"KFC is KFC. You know what you are going to get here. Food is decent, but customer service, order accuracy and cleanliness are the main concerns. Here is no different. There was a nice young lady that complimented my daughter, but there was also another person at the register that seemed like she didn't understand the things we we're ordering. On this visit, they we're not busy, but the drink station was an absolute mess. They had 2 sweet tea containers out and both were empty. The Mt. Dew was out and the Pepsi was going out. I just opted for my 4th option. These are things that should be checked regularly. Also, the floors were super slippery...... You know, that moist greasy kind of slippery with no visible wetness on the floor??? Yeah that. I'm just glad I didn't slip and bust my ass with my daughter there. LOL

But...... we got our food quickly, the order was right and the employees were nice enough. That counts for something, right??"}
{"text":"Went here dec.12th made my order in drivethru went to window to pay and waited a good 15min while no one came. Beeped horn. Girl came and said with an attitude\"were having trouble with the fryer\",then took my debit card and closed window. I beeped horn again and asked for manager and she said she was the manager(figures),and I said just give me my money back. You don't talk to customers that way and if your a manager you should know that. Got no apology just gave me my money and closed window. Got same crappy service from subway by Walmart. Typical of any place in these kinds of neighborhoods."}
{"text":"I don't even care about the wait or how disorganized it is or any of that but when they want to over charge you and argue with you...well that's a different story. I ordered 6 pc chicken only and said I want only thighs. He told me he cannot do that, the computer won't let him. Mind you i have been getting that for over 40 yrs lol. Then he said $25 something. I said but I only want the chicken and got upset, i said from the begining that I wanted just chicken.. So he comes back with $23 something I said 6 pcs are $14.99 how do you get $23 he said you ordered the new spicy. I said show me anywhere it says that its extra and he goes Do you want it or not I said NOT. As i was walking out i heard him say \"f you\". I will never go back there again. Everytime I go I pay a different price. Someone needs to investigate them"}
{"text":"Went here during lunch today ordered 2 five dollar fill up chicken pot pies that comes with cookie & a drink. Well got back to work no cookie, no eating utensils & no straw was given to us and these are items you shouldn't have to ask for...called the restaurant afterwards and voiced my compaint and they acted like it was no big deal they just said cone back and get your cookies ma'am no I won't fix the order right the 1st time and then you won't get bad reviews!!!"}
{"text":"Went to today 4/10/17 at 5:25pm they forgot to give me my cold slaw and we tried 5 times to call Well Phone off hook can u believe that! I went last month and was told to come inside because the Drive Thru Was CLOSED 1pm in the daytime. This store has some serious problem that have to be addressed I hope the owner of this store realizes there is a problem. I call Corporate KFC was told I would get a call we will see??"}
{"text":"Best chicken i have ever had it has great flavor. Same with the sides even their cookies are good! I must admit this is the best semi-fast food restaurant i have ever been to!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty slow and they never have the crispy wings ready. If your in the mood to wait go here. If your hungry hit up Walmart not good but ready."}
{"text":"Typical KFC.
Clean lobby and friendly service. 
It is nice that you can order Taco Bell and/or KFC.
Sometimes they do not have some menu items when I go during non-rush hours."}
{"text":"Fast drive thru and I was here at 3:30pm on a Friday. Staff was friendly and very helpful. Chicken was cooked perfectly and my biscuit was great. Lots of sauces to choose from and the place was very clean and bathroom were spotless. Great place will be coming back for sure :) A+ $"}
{"text":"Another entry from my Facebook's Veggie Burger Chronicles (I'm working on making the 2, this one and my FB's identical). Please note, I'm not rating the restaurant, just the burger.

Vegetarian Burger @ KFC:
-Toppings: Lettuce. It comes standard with mayo, but I can't have mayo so I had it with BBQ sauce instead.
-Patty: Fried, thus crunchy. It's white and flaky on the inside
-Price: ~$3.66 (just the burger) before or after tax. It came up to $3.69 at the Scarborough location I visited. The downtown Queen Street location came up to $3.66 after taxes.
-Verdict: It tastes like CHICKEN! LOL. It's entirely different from all the other veggie burgers that I had in the past because of the white patty; veggie burgers are conventionally brown. I wasn't impressed that it came with only shredded lettuce and mayo (although I skipped the mayo). The patty itself did not taste bad, it was very good actually, but I can't figure out what it's made of. One good thing about the KFC veggie burger is that it's virtually unknown, though it's available at most locations, which means you can always count on it being hot and crispy, because they'll make it fresh for you. Depending on your patience and hunger, this could be a bad thing because you need to wait 3-4 minutes for the burger to cook. For my meat eater friends and my vegan/ vegetarian friends who miss meat, neither of you can go wrong with this choice! TRY IT!"}
{"text":"I remember KFC being so much better than it was today. As far as fast food chicken tenders go they were always the best along with their honey mustard sauce but the ones I got today were thin, over breaded, and very very dry. Their mashed potatoes are still tasty though.

The service was fast and friendly and prices reasonable and they give you plenty of dipping sauces unlike other fast food chains.

I went thru the drive thru so I can't comment on the cleanliness or appearance of the inside."}
{"text":"Well here we go, back again cause my girlfriend wanted kfc... oh boy. Besides messing up the order leaving out the mac and cheese apparently there cutting there tenders in half and counting them as one!  
 I told my girlfriend that if she ever asks for kfc again I'm breaking up with her!"}
{"text":"This was the dirtiest KFC I have ever visited. I came to this location because I was in the area, but never will I return. The leather on most of the seating is torn, the tables were dirty, and the floor need to be swept and mopped. I can't imagine that they leave the kitchen prep area in any better shape. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"By far the worse KFC location I've ever been to. I've tried to get the new Nashville Hot chicken on two separate occasions. They advised me they would not have anymore even though they were open for another hour. Went through the drive thru today and their system was down. Went in the store and finally will be able to try this chicken. Rap music on where customers can hear. Overall unprofessional environment!!!"}
{"text":"Throughly disappointed and disgusted. We were craving KFC, hadn't gone there in a year or so. Walked inside and it was completely empty in there yet the entire dining area looked like they had been super busy. Oh wait, no they just hadn't cleaned anything for days. We would've just walked out and left but we already started ordering. The guy who took our order had no idea what he was doing and had to keep looking up to see what was actually on the menu, along with us having to help him put our order in correctly. 

We go to fill up our drinks and there was dried up and spilled soda everywhere. Trash on the floor, oh and the floors were extremely sticky, my wife's flip flop almost came off when she was taking a step! We wanted to sit in a booth but every single one was covered in food, trash, crumbs, or soda. Same problem with all the other tables, took a couple min to find the least dirty place to sit. We would've just brought the food home but our 3 year old was whining and wanted to eat.

The food.. meh not like we remember. Almost seemed like it was just what was left over from the day before.

Honestly I can't believe that KFC keeps this location open if they can't keep it up to company standards, hell not even health code standards. We got there not even an hour after it was open and you could tell it had been left dirty and trashed since the last shift, or even the last week or so. The manager there obviously doesn't care, and none of the employees do either.
Looking back on it now we should've just gone to chick-fil-a instead."}
{"text":"The customer service at all KFC locations is terrible. However the food is good, really good. Also, don't expect it to be ready. They will have to cook your food. So, it will take about ten minutes to get your order. I bought the country fried steak on special today. So delicious. They have good deals and coupons available. Some might say its a bit expensive. But its enough food to feed the whole family. Plates, napkins, forks and anything you might need is available for dine in or take out. Perfect if your going to the park or drive in."}
{"text":"Not the quality I was expecting. Too pricey for plain food. No longer a favorite. I was expecting it to be a little more family friendly."}
{"text":"Would give a negative star if I could. This place gave me violent food poisoning. Never eating here again. Not to mention the previous times I've been they always seemed short staffed so service was meh."}
{"text":"Asked for side of potato wedges and Mac and cheese, reach home and it's coleslaw and mashed potatoes. Fast but reckless"}
{"text":"Slow slow slow slow slow!!!!!!!! 

Usually fast food places (drive through) if they are running slow, they tell the person to pull up and wait by the front door for the employee to bring it out.
NOPE
They make you wait in line 15-20 minutes."}
{"text":"The quality that I've come to expect from KFC just hasn't been there lately.... I went this evening to this location just to get away from the everyday stuff I eat, but the price just doesn't work with what you get in my opinion. I got the $10 chicken share special with 6 original style pieces. They cram it in a plastic container with a see-through top that's half the size of the classic bucket now,  and I would have gotten sides I just didn't feel like spending another $3 - $7 just to have a little beans and/or coleslaw or even biscuits. The chicken itself felt like someone spilled some water on them because there was so much grease on them when I bit into it, it felt too juicy it was near mushy that I couldn't get a sound of crispy texture from the breading. The taste is sort of the same to the classic recipe but I think they soggy nature of the food takes away from the classic taste, I'm disappointed in my experience and not sure when i'll decide to visit one in the future."}
{"text":"Slow drive-through. The order taker will not budge or offer any suggestions to changing anything on the menu seems, So much so the current for me just drove off In fact I got to the window and they wouldn't work with me on call slaw soap beep beep I drove off to do in a row I'm changing just one star"}
{"text":"If I don't wake up tomorrow talk to the colonel. This chicken was horrible. Please don't go to this KFC."}
{"text":"Service is great, very friendly staff. Didn't care for choli cheese dog, so hubby got me some popcorn chicken and it was really good. The honey mustard is made with a grainy mustard and it was great. Will diffidently come here again."}
{"text":"They didn't even start cooking my order until 6 minutes after I placed my order.  Poor attitudes terrible service"}
{"text":"Waited more than 15 minutes in the drive through. Finally asked people to back up and let us out. This is completely unacceptable not one car moved in 15 minutes??   Next call is to report it to corporate 3 cars behind us also left"}
{"text":"This place is horrible on a lunch break came to this place for a quick bite second person in line twenty minute wait gave this place another chance went through the drive through they gave me the wrong food ."}
{"text":"Why in the world am I reviewing KFC? Because i just had 4 wisdom teeth taken out this morning and I no longer have the capacity to bite into anything. My lunch? I bought a pint of Starbucks Hot Cho ice cream from Fry's and came here and got Mashed Potatoes and Gravy. Was it good? You bet your bottom dollar it was. Look, if I could go to Modern Steak and pound down some delicious veggie medley and tender filet, I would. But being drugged up and losing 75% of my mouthing capabilities severely limits me. Don't judge. All I can say is that Mashed Potatoes and Gravy from KFC has always been a guilty pleasure, and now I have a reason to chow it down."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful! I've gone here three times and each of those times they have forgotten something out of my order. The last time I went they literally forgot my whole order and I was sitting in the front where they ask me to pull around to for 30 minutes. The never give me my receipt and it's really ridiculous to pay $60 for a dinner for my husband and three kids on the only day I have off and have one or multiple things missing. I order dinner last night and two of my sides were missing and what is sad is I expected that as soon as I got home. This store is so bad."}
{"text":"The staff here makes the place great! Every time I come here the employees are prompt, polite and really friendly. 

And the KFC bowl is heaven in a dish."}
{"text":"I'm not a fast food person but needed a quick bite before hitting a long commute. This was the only place I saw on the way to the freeway. Argh. 

The restaurant looked freshly updated. It was relatively clean for what appeared to be a busy day. My server was polite. 

I ordered the chicken little with mashed potatoes. Both were ok. I remember the original chicken littles years ago and those had much more flavor. No complaints other than its like a rock in my stomach - probably because I don't eat nuked fake food often. 

Oh - and they only have one container in the whole restaurant for iced tea. If they run out then it'll be at least 15 minutes before you can get a refill. Bad planning on managements part. They should have one out front and one brewing. I only drink iced tea or water so I paid for a 1/2 cup of iced tea."}
{"text":"Its a small location that serve both kfc and taco bell. It probably doesnt seat more then dozen people, seem to be more like an take out/express stop

I didnt see any real issue, food was find, quite, nothing too special but what are you expecting from kfc/taco bell"}
{"text":"Horrible service at this resturant via the drive thru. They forget food and do not say thank you or even smile when greeting you handing you the food. 
I will definitely not go back to this store."}
{"text":"This is one of Calgary's most poorly run stores. Staff are very unorganized and it takes forever. If you enjoy waiting in line for your food, this is the place for you"}
{"text":"what kinda shit is dis. damn kfc fucking kentucky fried \"chicken\" was out of fucking chicken. i realize we are in gastonia and shouldn't expect much but damn it's in the name."}
{"text":"My friend and I had lunch at this location on a Monday. First off, there was something sticky on the floor. It looked like they hadn't mopped in years. We went to the register to order. The young gal said just a minute while she counted her drawer at the food prep area. I thought this was strange considering that the door said they opened at 10 a.m. and it was 11:15 a.m. We waited until she counted her drawer. I asked her if we needed a coupon for the chicken fried steak meal. She said yes. Then I said, the sticker on the window is advertising it as $3.50 on Mondays. But, I do have a coupon that has it on there too with the caveat of \"Mondays only.\" She said, no you don't need the coupon. We proceeded to order two meals. My meal came out and I noticed there was gravy that had dripped all over the tray. The other gal wiped it off with a napkin. I was thinking that was nice of her, but she should've done it before calling my name. They only gave us forks. My friend went back and asked for knives. She said they didn't have any knifes. So, my friend got honey for the biscuits. I went back and asked for two more forks. Otherwise, we would've had to eat the chicken fried steak like a rib. Let's just say it wasn't fork tender. The entire experience wasn't great. We decided to YELP the location and discovered this was the typical experience. My advice is to eat somewhere else. The place is dirty and hopefully, my friend and I live to eat another meal at a different place."}
{"text":"I spent 30min in the drive thru, can't even get my order right. I will never go back to this location, worst service EVER!"}
{"text":"This has to be the worst kfc I've been to.. the first time I came they ran out of chicken smh now I've been waiting for 20mins just to get potatoes wedges and a fill up bowl... 20mins? They had me pull to the side and came out with another order that was not mine .. ridiculous!!! They're not even busy so I don't understand"}
{"text":"They now charge you when you use your card to pay for your meal. As always the food is great, this time, though the service was lacking. They forgot to give us utensils and a couple of sides to our meals. Had to ask for butter and honey for the biscuits too. One thing that really upsets me is the charge of 25 cents for extra dipping sauces, one is  never enough."}
{"text":"I don't understand the negative reviews, I'm guessing they were written by harried customers during busy times here at the restaurant, when everyone is on edge. 

I came in, somewhat expecting a bad experience (based on the reviews here), but was pleasantly surprised.  They got my order right, were very friendly in spite of the busy time, and I will be back.

Nice job, guys."}
{"text":"Use to come here quite a bit back in the day. But looky now, this KFC has all grown up into a space age fast food place designed by HGTV?  Maybe. 

The old setup was kind of run down and needed a freshening up, and now it's gotten it. But some of the old ways that gave it a well deserved Two Stars by my friend Donald S and one Star from Heather C. are still present. 

What's with the ghetto $0.39 charge for using plastic. Do I get a discount for using Cash like at an ARCO station?  Nope, sorry.  Heck, this is Old Town Scottsdale and the Franchisee should retire this cheapo technique. 

As for the food and employees, well they're both solid. Cammie was friendly, offered to bring out my food when it was ready and asked for & remembered my name!  She even came by and asked midway through my meal if everything was alright. Wow

I had the Chicken sandwich with the FLG sauce, along with some strips and it was Three Stars, A-Okay good. So I'm not going to lower my rating just for the extra credit card usage charge, but..."}
{"text":"I would give this KFC zero stars if I could. Every time I come here it is a long wait. Going through the drive-thru on a Wednesday night should not take half an hour!  All I ordered was two Famous Bowl meals and soft drinks. I don't know if they had to slaughter chickens or grow the potatoes, but this was unacceptably long for an easy order. It was over twenty minutes before I was even able to place my order. There were only three cars ahead of me. The person taking orders waited until the person in front of me was at the window to pick up. I will never go back to this KFC again."}
{"text":"Big sign in the window on Mothers Day, \"Free red velvet cake with 10 piece meal or larger.\"  That's it.  No specifications.  We ordered the 12 piece mixed bucket for $29.99.  After reaching the car and realizing that we didn't get the free cake. (Which was always included back in Pennsylvania), we went back in and asked about it.  Apparently our 12 piece dinner didn't qualify.  They said it was the \"other\" dinner that qualified.  What other meal?  The one that cost $3.00 more.  So much for free cake.  False advertising.
We also didn't get a choice of our sides.  We were told what they would be.  Bad planning KFC.
Plus they charge a $.39 fee to use a debit card.  Are you kidding me?

Not happy KFC."}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE!
I came here at 10:10 and they close at 11 today (Saturday). They literally told me that they have NO chicken. I asked them \"So, you you're telling me that I'm at KFC and you don't have chicken?\". The guy said, \"Yes. We can put some popcorn chicken on, but it would be three minutes. We don't have any chicken.\""}
{"text":"This is the worst KFC consistently I have ever been to. I don't know why I waste my money here but I keep trying hoping they improve. 
First off, I'm going to call corporate to complain about the staff. They must have a horrible owner that consistently hires the worst people. We arrived today and there was a female employee standing in the order area where customers stand, arguing with a male employee who was behind the counter. They both saw that we were there looking at them, figuring they would stop. Also, there were several senior citizens sitting in the dining area watching this drama as well. When they finally finished, and I'm not exaggerating when I say they argued for 5 minutes while we waited, the female employee left and glared at us as she walked by, as if trying to intimidate us. The food was less than what I expected, I was just happy to get the heck out of that rat hole. This location has been really awful since I moved to this area in 2002. KFC corporate should consider who they let have a franchise, and realize it looks bad on KFC as a company, not the person that owns this location."}
{"text":"I love KFC, but this location is horrible. I stopped by on 7/21/14 and bought 2 meals. The chicken was dry and way overcooked. They really need to get some workers in there that know how to cook. I have been going to this location for several years now, and the first few times the chicken was awesome (about 3 years ago), but it has gone downhill since then. The other location that went downhill closed last year (105th / Indian School). I really hope the corporation looks at these reviews and attempts to solve the problems, because KFC is our favorite place for chicken. I gave 1 star for the side dishes."}
{"text":"If all KFCs were like this one, they'd be out of business. 1.) The chicken was dry and old, clearly left under a heat lamp for hours. 2.) They informed us we could only have one piece of white boneless cause they were out of it. So they gave us dark boneless instead. Turns out they just didn't feel like making more at that time. When we were leaving they finally decided to make more, as we heard them yelling to the cooks to make more. We would have gladly waited for fresh chicken and for white meat. We were mislead and it was a cruddy thing to do. The biscuits were hard, the mash taters were horrid. All in all I'd say stay clear of this KFC location. Unless you like very old, very salty chicken and don't mind eating what they feel like making when they feel like making it."}
{"text":"I liked their chicken in this location. Pretty good taste. The staff is friendly and will give you advice on what to get if you ask. Only bad thing is they didn't provide me with plates but other than that pretty good."}
{"text":"Second time i ordered from this location and both time my food took almost two hours delivery should of ordered popeyes."}
{"text":"Now why don't you all hire more people like Rick.  Dude is the prime example of costumer service.  That is all."}
{"text":"How & Why would you twice fry a piece of chicken? In the last three visits to this location, I got jipped out of two pieces of chicken, twice! My wife & I ordered a 10 piece meal and received 8 pieces in the bucket. It was the large bucket too. Certainly big enough for a 10 or 12 piece. You call & call & call, no one answers the blessed phone, ever. I have gotten a couple of legs that were so dry and meatless and other times the breasts were just barely warm. Push, push, push the food and grab, grab, grab your money!"}
{"text":"Love this place. 5 dollar meals, clean and nice help!! Ranked in top 10 for clean for sure!! Right across from Kia dealership. Drive thru fast!!"}
{"text":"We don't go to KFC that often but we did about a week ago...Had a coupon for an 8 pc dinner and got home and there were only 7 pcs...If you're lobbying for higher minimum wage, the first thing to do is make sure you have the right amount of pieces...We won't say we will never go there again, but we are on a fixed income and every little bit counts..."}
{"text":"Wait is always a bit long, but they just remodeled the dining area and it really looks a lot better. Polite staff that makes sure your satisfied."}
{"text":"Only KFC that ALWAYS makes a good famous bowl. It's always filled to the brim and They never forget my fork either!"}
{"text":"There is a girl that works the front (brown girl with light eyes) that just has a terrible attitude.  

You could be very respectful but for some reason this girl just has issues.  She is condescending, the way she speaks is disrespectful, and she screams at customers.  It is strange and awkward

I just want to eat some fried chicken without any drama....ill come back to this location when they change up this issue."}
{"text":"I would give no star if it would let me. 1 car ahead of us at the drive thru window when we ordered, pulled up behind them, they must have been waiting a long time because we sat behind him for 16 minutes before he finally drove off with no food. Pulled up to the window and we waited and other few minutes before the girl opened the window. No apology for the long wait, just a \"hi it's going to be $23.xx\" give her our money, and she closes the window. Wait another few minutes for her to even give us back our change and when she does she just hands it to me. Wait another 5-6 minutes and she comes back with our food \"here you go\". For real?!? No \"sorry about the wait\" \"sorry for my rudeness\" whatever. I ask for paper plates and she looks at me like I'm bothering her \"how many do you need?\" Okay I then ask politely \"4 please\". Again returns with no comment. I look through our bags and notice no biscuits, I ask \"excuse did the order come with biscuits?\" Her reply, \"it's in the bucket\". Okay then. After that I didn't even want to ask for honey or butter, I just wanted to leave. I was polite the whole time. I had every right to be upset due to the fact that all that took over 25 minutes, but I wasn't. Then I look inside and they have all the chairs up like it was closing time when it wasn't. Take some customer service classes KFC employees, learn how to treat people. If you don't like your job, then don't work there.  Plain and simple. Then we get back to our hotel (visiting from San Diego) and our chicken was supposed to be all original and ended up being half crispy and half original, it was way over cooked and the smushed our biscuits into the bucket. By far the worst ever and a waste of almost $24."}
{"text":"Man!! I never write reviews and this just got me pissed off.. drive up after a long day of work to get a quick bite an try to order a to go bowl, after being told how half the menu has a .27 charge for additional sauce and 2.00 for additional side I happily accepted and continued. I then go up to the window and can see four workers just standing there (slower time) talking what ever. The guy I spoke with acted like I was a problem for being there !! And rushed me out as soon as possible! So okay what ever maybe your having a bad day.. THEN I drive off not looking mistakenly to notice I didn't get a DAMN COOKIE.. shit you can't have dinner without desert! Pointless to even cal cause they won't believe you. Needless to say I ordered my meal mainly for there cookie after and was disappointed. Will not return.. EVER and I love KFC."}
{"text":"Apparently this location \"doesn't carry Grilled Chicken\" even after I ordered a 2 peace meal and was asked how I wanted my chicken. I said grilled then paid for my meal, once it was ready the lady looked at me like I was a fucking idiot and pretty much said I was wrong. Even though the menu said Grilled or Original she proceeded to stay at it and find a reason on how I was apparently in the wrong."}
{"text":"I felt the attitude of the staff could have been a lot better.  If I smile at you I would appreciate very much to have a smile returned.  I am very smiley person especially when I am in line to order fried chicken  but the cashier turned my smile upside down by frowning at me."}
{"text":"Went there last Saturday wanted to write this the same night but I waited because I was soooo upset. When I spend 25.00 for chicken I think I have the right to expect that it is edible. It was not. I have complained to KFC 800 # and received a coupon for free chicken but this is unacceptable and I recommend that if you're thinking of going there seriously reconsider."}
{"text":"They didn't have any chicken tenders , they gave me the wrong orders , and they ran out of drum stick"}
{"text":"Went here one time and got the family meal for $20. When I got home there was no cole slaw or gravy for the potatoes. I drove back and explained what happened, I asked the lady (Esmeralda) if I could have an extra gravy for my troubles. She scoffed at me and said no it's $1.30. I'm not opposed to paying but was grossed out at the lack of any customer service."}
{"text":"I have not gone to KFC in years but decided to try again as I liked the extra crispy. Three weeks ago I went to the store on Mount Pleasant. I ordered a bucket and asked for all extra crispy. I heard the cashier tell the cook. The cook said to make sure to key it in the register. I get home and half the chicken is regular. Okay. Human error. Yesterday I went to same store and asked for 12 pieces with fries. I asked to please make sure that it is ALL extra crispy. I get home and there are  NO FRIES!!! I may go to KFC again but never the one on Mount Pleasant. They are just not worth the frustration."}
{"text":"Went through the drive-through, after trying to decipher whatever the lady was trying to tell me on the intercom I ordered 3 chicken tenders, mashed potatoes and gravy, and coleslaw. I usually check the order right then and there because most of the drive-through people are just downright idiots, but this time I try to have faith in mankind. When I get home, I open the box to find a chicken leg, A thigh, macaroni and cheese, and coleslaw. I didn't even get a receipt and felt that going back and fighting with these idiots was pointless. I'm done."}
{"text":"The staff is asleep at the wheel here. Tables are dirty, floor not swept, people waiting longer than usual for food. 

I stood in line at the counter for 10 mins without being acknowledged.

I wanted to add to the review: It wasn't until I got home that i realized my food was made wrong."}
{"text":"The service rates a 5 but the chicken rates a 2.

I told the cashier I hadn't eaten at KFC in years.  She took the time to point out some new items on the menu which was much appreciated.  She was very helpful and patient as I made my decision.  

The french fries were fine.  But the breaded chicken was way too salty!  They're probably following the colonel's original recipe.  Please KFC, it's time to change that recipe!  I wonder if they use too much salt on purpose to sell more beverages. 

Other comments:
-  the prices were reasonable  
- I can't comment on the cleanliness of the restaurant since I took my order 'to go'
- there were plenty of parking spots available"}
{"text":"Went in again last night, no one was there to serve me for 5 minutes.......5 minutes!!!! When I did get my order, as I sat in the lobby, I heard the cooks/supervisor cursing AGAIN, thank God I don't have children or I would be really really angry. They shout curse words at each other and also, AGAIN I hear racism. Seriously? Seriously? ................where is the owner!? I am reporting this to corporate."}
{"text":"Actually my real rating is -10... !! Worst KFC Experience Ever!

Last night I went to the Savoy KFC and ordered a chicken tender meal and a three piece chicken meal at the drive thru menu. Pretty simple... not rocket science. Pulled up to the window and the order was messed up. Instead of two meals they only had one. I gave them the order again at the window, twice the person who took my order had to come back and ask me what I wanted. I gave my order again two more times, each time slowly. 

When I got home and unpacked the meals, the chicken tenders looked like burnt up shoe strings and my three pieces of chicken looked as though they had been dipped in tar they were so black and over cooked. This was more than disappointing... 

This place is really bad! Do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else. Seriously!!"}
{"text":"At this KFC, they don't seem to understand if you order an extra large coleslaw, you want an extra coleslaw! You pay $3.99 for it, you expect it to be in the bag. Never happens! My DH is not smart enough to check the bag before he leaves the KFC, so we just paid $3.99 for nothing, again!
The chicken was nice and tender, but whoever they have making the biscuits must be drunk. They don't even look like biscuits. Maybe they should just use frozen ones. 
Love KFC, but not this one. Time to check a different location. East Wash (Eken Park Location) is no longer convenient or economical."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the experience of the location.
Looks very nice and clean. Food was fresh vicky had great customer service."}
{"text":"What horrible \"service\" rude and speak in Spanish thinking we don't understand when you talk shit about us because we aren't Hispanic. Nice, KFC."}
{"text":"Suck and suck some more... eat roadkill instead

0.stars I took 15 mins to get the order and missing mashed potatoes in the mashed potatoes... really!
Gravy only!

No spork... Mt dew was empty so I took another soda.. they said sorry I'll replace it... 29 mins later still didn't replace... food was Luke warm.


Worst KFC..."}
{"text":"Where can I start? Oh yeah with the little Asian chick that speaks broken English, asks you to repeat your order (face-to-face) 3 times, takes the payment,  does not wash her hands, and proceeds to walk toward the food to prepare your order!  I have been there when they have ignored customers after they have taken their money and given them the wrong order, or left something out of the order. This place leaves a lot to be desired to say the least. The manager s rude & unprofessional as well. Calling the Health Department on this location will be the next step."}
{"text":"I give this KFC location a 3 for the food, however the costumer service I get here is always bad. I come here very often almost every break because I work in the mall. The workers are always rude and grumpy. I always ask for my meat well done and fries well done and they always roll their eyes like I've done something wrong. Most of the time I get my food, it's not even what I ask for. One lady is named Rose and the rest idk their names."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here to get dinner to go. We walked in and it's like they never heard of AC! Hot as can be, flies buzzing  around, no rating on the building. This place is repulsive and I will never return. KFC has gone down hill over the years, it's definitely not like it used to be that's for sure. This place is dirty and gross! I guess they've never heard of cleanliness before!"}
{"text":"Went here late on a Friday night. Didnt realized that KFC dining room wasnt open past 10. I mean fried chicken after 10 should be a standard. This location was one of the few placed that the drive through was open past 10, 11pm to be exact. We ordered the 8 piece KFC Nashville Fried Chicken. We had seen so many commercials and we actually had the chance to try the real thing in Nashville at this place call Pattie V's. We wanted to see the comparison cause the real one in Nashville was HOOTTTTTT.
The best thing about this place is that when we ordered the Cashier guy who took our order sounds EXACTLY like AZIZ ansari!!!! We couldnt stop cracking up in the car.
The 8peice meal comes with 8 peices (mixture of breasts, wings, drumsticks) and 2 large sides (we got mashed potatoes) and 4 buicuits. They actually were short 1 buicuit, so they offered us some cookie as a replacement. I am really not a sweet person so I asked for an original crispy chicken tender. At first the cashier said no but very very quickly the manager said yes! I was so Happy cause I love fried chicken (fast food or not) I am not a snob about my fried chicken. 
Shaun our cashier/person who gave us our food was sooooo happy and pleasant and the fact that he was able to give me a tender instead of a biscuit made my night. So much that I gave to their charity and in return you get a BOGO coupon for chicken pot pit.
If you are reading this Shaun! You were such a pleasure! Your smile and additude was so welcoming and kind. Your manager needs to give you a raise!!!!"}
{"text":"People are totally right about this place: DRIVE-THRU IS A MESS. AND YES CHECK YOUR ORDER
Scene: 1230pm on a Sunday Nov 5. Very simple order- 2 cars in the drive-thru line- Order a Georgia Gold chicken little sandwich ($1.79) and a Nashville Hot Chicken Box (1 Breast and 1 drumstick- side of mashed potatoes and a biscuit- $5.99). The car in front of us, idk what they ordered but we waited about 10min in our car- which is unheard of for drive thru. 
Then when we get to the front- the lady doesnt even greet us- she pretty much throws the food at us and while i check the order (BECAUSE I READ ALL THE PREVIOUS REVIEWS while waiting in the car for the car in front of us to get their food); and of course- and I was highly wishing all the previous reviewed were just incorrect- but sadly they were.
I opened the bag and this is what i got:
1) A nashville hot chicken small sandwich- when i ordered a georgia gold
2) The chicken order was correct but when I look for the mashed potatoes, I am sadly surprised with cole slaw

When I ask Sarah what happened, all she said, \"the girl musta ran your order up wrong.\"
The whole time im looking at her with the headset as I see her taking the other drive thru orders thinking- YOU ran the order wrong. 
I really felt bad for her in some sorta way because she musta be overworked and short staffed.
BUT SERIOUSLY I DIDNT WANT THE PREVIOUS REVIEWS TO ALL BE RIGHT and they were!

HINT: ALWAYS CHECK YOUR DRIVE THRU order here. ALWAYS. Or you wont be leaving with what you ordered."}
{"text":"This location is always underwhelming. They are constantly out of either a certain type of chicken or chicken tenders. I've had too many occasions to name that they've said sorry we are out... specifically around early dinner hours of 6pm-7pm.  If you are craving KFC I would suggest possibly calling ahead of time before making a trip and being disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was so gross it was offensive. 

The best part of the meal was the damn drink.

It's my own dumb fault for skipping breakfast during a overtime shift and I paid the price. One poor decision begets another."}
{"text":"The only constant to this location is that they can only be counted on to screw up your order. The staff will forget parts of your order or not give you honey packets when you ask for them or their being a very long wait despite being the only customer there. Bottom line this location can and will screw up your order every chance they get. Go to a different location."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this KFC, I swear I am never going to go back.  Every time, they have messed up my order.  Every single time.  Tonight, I have had it.  I ordered two extra biscuits, and I paid for two extra biscuits.  I get home, and there are no extra biscuits.  I call them, and they try to offer to make it right when I come back (it ain't happening), and I let her know that I won't be going back ever, I just want the money for two biscuits refunded back on my card. After some back and forth on why she cannot do that, and why I am not going to drive the 3 miles back so that she can \"make it right\" (something that should have been done in the first place),  she finally agreed to do so (I haven't seen the refund on my card yet, but it has been less than an hour).  It is really up to us to show this business that we aren't going to take their BS anymore.  If they've done the same thing to you, do what I am now going to do...Never give them a dime more of your money, and let everyone that you talk to that this is a horrible place to support.  Stand up and say \"NO MORE\".  By withholding your money to them, let them know that they either need to change their restaurant NOW or close the doors down.  Also, if you do go and throw your money away there and are dissatisfied because they screwed it up (like always), demand your money back from them.  No more \"I'll make it up the next time\" offers, no more driving back to their store (wasting your gas).  Let them know that the only way that they can make it right is by returning your money."}
{"text":"I really like this kfc.  I get food fpr my firl friend and when the food is bad i look dumb.  I have been to this kfc 2 times and both times i asked which was the freshest or newest chickem.  They direct me to the freshest and both times it was really good."}
{"text":"When I visited this KFC, it was a good visit.  There weren't many guests at the time. Which translates to no waiting in line to order food or fill soda pop cups.

What can I say?  This was a typical friendly KFC.  The food was standard KFC quality.  Finger lickin' good. My favorite is original recipe. No complaints.

Personally, I think KFC is kinda pricey when it comes to chicken.  8 pieces with two large sides and two drink with a cost of more than $15 and less than $20 .. I think is a bit much.  Which is the reason why I don't come here often just to have \"chicken\".  I want KFC chicken when I visit. Which is at a premium.  I expect that."}
{"text":"This is the most consistent worst KFC food.  KFC should revoke heir franchise license.  Chicken breading is lumped and not covering the entire chicken like an amateur cook fried chicken at home.  Chicken potpie is dry inside and salty.  Please do everyone a favor and Close this store."}
{"text":"Worst place ever! Don't eat there! Every time I go, they always forget something! Worst place ever!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Friend asked me to get them some food.  I was only customer in there and they screwed up my order.  Cashier even read the order back to me.  When i got tp my friends place, half the order was missing.  I don't eat kfc so i don't know about food quality but avoid this location."}
{"text":"Broke a tooth on their product in October 2015- it literally sheared my back tooth in two. To date no one has returned my calls regarding this matter"}
{"text":"Bad service mediocre food. Went through the drive thru and did not get my complete order. Had to get out to correct it and they reluctantly gave me my food no apology at all whatsoever. Sad"}
{"text":"They regularly get my order wrong. I'm partially to blame since I keep going back. I'm almost willing to drive a few miles just to try a different store."}
{"text":"Love the affordable meal options. The crew were friendly and the restaurant was fairly clean. Only complaint was the strawberry Fanta and the fruit punch was out on the foundation machine so I had to settle for something else."}
{"text":"Terrible service - the associates appeared to be preoccupied with personal issues arguing.  I did not get what I ordered even though I tried to clarify before I left with a to go order."}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars I would give them the negative 5. Their service is horrible. There was no greeting and every employee seemed so focused on drive through that my boyfriend stood in front of the register for over 2 minutes and even though the crew made eye contact with him and even passed by in front of him a few times no one acknowledged him. He finally asked if they were still open and the crew member passing by said no and kept walking toward the drive through. I couldn't believe the attitude and bad service. I love KFC and sometimes even stop by just for the busicutes and mac and cheese which was the case that night. My boyfriend walked out and I asked to speak to the manager. She too was working the drive through and had me wait at least 3 minutes before she came forward. I told her what happened which I'm sure she knew since she was in the room when it happened. I asked her why she allowed such poor service. I asked her why all her employees were in the back working drive through and the front was being ignored during open hours. All she said was she was sorry it happened. I want to mention her name and the rude boy in this review but I just honestly think she and the entire store crew needs to get retrained"}
{"text":"We bought a family meal and they forgot our coleslaw... but they live so far away to come back"}
{"text":"Common practice for this location to lock the doors 10 minutes before the lobby closes, and 40 minutes before the drive thru closes. Has happened multiple times, tonight 8/31/17. Two employees ignored me as I waited to have my order taken and then pulled to the front window where they continued to ignore the fact that they saw me waiting there."}
{"text":"I would leave zero stars if I could. I ordered TWO mashed potato bowls in the drive through. The attendant asks me to park and he will bring me my food out. He hands me two drinks and I drive away to park and wait for my food. He comes out after 10 mins or so, and hands me a bag. I get to work and there is only ONE bowl in the bag. I called the restaurant and speak to Keisona, that tells me she is in a lunch rush, and cannot help me. Was charged for TWO bowls. No apology. No attempts to resolve. Had to call their customer service to file a complaint. Will NEVER come to this location again."}
{"text":"What a joke, no honey BBQ chicken sandwich, no ice or carbonation in the soda machine, chicken pot pie all gravy and potato."}
{"text":"Your usual KFC and taco bell. For when you are hungry and in a hurry. I usually come to the drive thru but I don't mind eating in every once in a while. Fast service. Clean restaurant. Spacey booths. Free WiFi."}

Do I feel for them!? to an extent! they SEE hardship, kids with EVEN less than themselves,

 NO NO..Your lack of education, care, concern for, lack of role model, & just plain growing up in, (que too short) \"The Ghetto\" is NOT an excuse!"}
{"text":"Don't eat here much anymore. It seems they are ALWAYS out of one or another items. Biscuits more than once and twice they were out of CHICKEN! It's KFC! How do you run out if chicken!?!"}
{"text":"i will never patronize kfc at all at any location i just went through the drive thru they took my order didn't have any food ready that i wanted to order so i settled figuring they were busy. the rude manager exhibited profanity specifically the f word when i asked for a refund at the drive thru window his concern was prople behind me not me i spent 36$ so i park go in try to get a refund the jerk and his staff refused to give me his name then had the audacity to call bellevue police to have me thrown out of the restaurant still never got his name. cops say it's a civil matter it's not the money at this point  it's the principal of the matter
 crappy attitude and service especially from a manager i'm filing a formal complaint with corporate and calling posdibly filing  charges for this incident. i was humiliated and embarassed i'm done with kfc..if i could rate it zero i would"}

Then He mad dogs me & say's They're 25 cents each. Then, I nicely responded \"okay\". I go to the car to get more cash then I Walk Back In, He Wasn't Even The Cashier, So he stood  behind the other cashier, he just kept Staring & making faces Like A Creep. Like I understand If you're going to charge for the sauces but atleast Don't Be Maddoging Your Customer, I'm buying your food. Plus Why Be Grumpy In The First Place? I'm just a regular teenage girl ordering, why even make me faces? I hope you retire soon. Seems Like You need it"}
{"text":"I didn't even want to give this place one star! Do not go to this KFC! The service is disgusting! The manager that doesn't speak very good English says every time they mess up my order \"I'll comp you next time.\" This has been every time I've been there. I always think, ok maybe this time the service will be better, nope! A disappointment every time! Do not go here!! Even the manager doesn't know how to fill a simple order. K-cups come with fries! The manager just threw under-cooked popcorn chicken in the k-cup and thought it would be okay and no one would notice. The manager doesn't care. I think his employees know they have awful service because they are quick to point out the manager is the one who filled my order. 
They say 10 minutes for the hot wings every time and every time it take more than 15 minutes! They tell you to pull forward and they will be out with your wings and they never come out in a timely manner. There's always parked cars waiting for their food. I know for sure I will never go back to this location. I will drive 10-15 miles for better service!"}
{"text":"5:30 PM & they are out of drumsticks, all styles. 13 minute wait. I guess the dinner hour snuck up on them. On to plan B."}
{"text":"Fast service, relatively clean, although I find the chicken too greasy and salty. The Cole slaw is excellent. I don't like that all the meals come with drinks now, although you can still order without, they just don't list them on the menu board.

There's a guarantee posted, they will remake any part of your meal, but I also noticed they can cancel the guarantee at anytime. Makes me wonder if that's actually a guarantee."}
{"text":"Ordered a feast. Regular, also known as original. It was still spicy and they added heat to the gravy. Soggy old chicken instead of crispy. Your choice is spiced hot or really hot. I get it's an \"ethnic\" area but where's the original for we who find hot food painful?"}
{"text":"I also wanted to give a shout out to the employee Erik. Great customer service! Well trained employee! Very nice guy! :-)"}
{"text":"I just want to start off by saying that I truly hate to give negative reviews. I typically don't write in for fast food chains but I feel I must share my experience. I went to KFC earlier this week and I kid you not they had NO CHICKEN. I thought it was a sick joke but the cashier truly seemed apologetic. As dumb as it seems, I went BACK. I ordered my food and the woman taking my order kept giving me my total before I could even finish. \"May I have the combo...total....ok and an order of....total.....\" As annoying as that is, I finally got through. Here's to the reason for the review and impeding call to corporate. I used a $20 bill to pay for my $14 and change order. The woman gives me my coins with honey and \"drops some\" as she says. I go to put the honey away and fish for my coins. I look up and the woman is gone and window closed. I wait and flag her down and ask for how much my total was again. She says \"oh\" and THEN gives my my receipt before attempting to close the window again. I say \"excuse me but I kid with a $20\". This woman says \"oh yea that's what I took out\", she gives me my $5 but didn't open the register meaning she had my money! It's unbelievable that she would \"forget\" change and receipt. Wow. Oh and my food was cold. Will NEVER be back."}
{"text":"If i could do a half start and that would be too much.
Went there and the 3 cashier were was rude
Like i was bothering them?
I was there at least 5-6mins before i said something.
Then i &ust walked out.
Never will i go back to this location again."}
{"text":"What happened to KFC? Overpriced and chicken always seems to be undercooked. I've given up....I can make better chicken and honestly chicken is pretty inexpensive.  So long Colonel Sanders!"}
{"text":"I know all KFC's aren't the same, but the one on Gilbert and Williams field rd is where I typically go. I feel for them because it seems like they don't get much business, but every time I do go there they forget something. Tonight they forgot to give me my cookie and biscuit with my order. I hope they get it together. Good luck"}
{"text":"Have gone to this location for the last time. Service is always terrible. Always check your order before you leave because 8 times out of 10 it is wrong. I stayed away for along time. Decided to try it tonight after a long day at work. The web site said they were open until midnight when I drove up all the lights were out. I called the store and was informed that they closed at 8pm the day after Thanksgiving. I asked why it wasn't posted and was informed it was on the door, couldn't read it because there wasn't any lights on. When I said their website said they were open until 12am he said he didn't control it. Will never come back to this location again. If I could do less than 1 star I would"}
{"text":"One star because I can't give them any less. 
The staff was worst than incompetent and ignorant. There was no one at the store so they can't even say they were busy. 
Not only they got my order wrong, but when I did get my order, it tasted terrible. Really felt like I was eating a piece of rubber and not chicken. It was obviously an old chicken patty. 


I guess my KFC days are over.  I'll never eat kfc again."}
{"text":"When i went, We were served just chicken, asked for wedges because we asked \"Chicken Bucket for 2\" and were given wedges, but, were given so many wedges that there was too many for the chicken. Next, we asked for lemonade, was given cups and was forced to get fountain drinks, my boyfriend got tea, and i got Tropicana fruit punch, heres the issue, the tea tasted like new tea and old tea, and wasnt very cold, so it tasted like somewhat flavored water, and the fruit punch tasted like fruity shaved ice syrup, and i ended up feeling sick. The only good thing was the chicken and the polite service from the one cashier who was trying, but his superior was as rude as he was nice. Never going back again"}
{"text":"This place has seriously gone downhill in recent years! When I noticed that the extra-crispy and original chicken started tasting like they were fried in month-old oil, I began ordering grilled instead. Then they stopped serving grilled! Gah. So then my standard order became the $5 Chicken Tenders Fill-up meal (which are actually $5.25 at this location) and that was all right for a while, but now even the tenders taste bleah. Plus, they seem to have a high turn-over of personnel. On my most recent visit, the cashier was someone I hadn't seen before, and she chucked out my meal without the sauce. I waited for a while to ask for the sauce, but she was too busy doing other stuff so I just at the darn tenders sauce-less. 

Once Chick-Fil-A opens up nearby, it's bye-bye Colonel!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing experience. Took a long time to get the food, and everything I wanted was not available and had to settle for something else. The person working the register had to go and check what was available in the back. Took way too long. I have been here once before and had a great experience, not sure if I'll come back."}
{"text":"They have no business calling this location fast food. It's 1:30 pm the place is almost empty one person in line in front of me and one table waiting for a messed up order to be fixed. It took about 10 minutes for them to get to the one person in front of me. That person had e \"pre order\" to pick up. Their order was not ready and was 30 minutes late. Luckily the food was cooked and they only had to box it. 5 minutes later they brought that order to the counter and it was wrong. Once fixed it's my turn 20 minute wait for #2 in line. They have a drive through at this location which was backed up too. They only had three viable employees 1 cook, 1 drive through teller and 1 front desk. No clean up, no prep very understaffed."}
{"text":"Recently I found that this Kfc location was closest to my house so one day decided to go there. Before i did I read all the bad reviews and one review specially about getting the wrong order which almost made me not go there but I decided to try it for myself. So I head in immediately I noticed nobody greeted me or anything. I was standing there for a min until finally one worker came to help. I gave them my order and waited and when it was ready she said \" here you go\" and just threw my food there. I got home and when I noticed they gave me green beans instead of the mash potatoes I asked for. I was very bothered because I made it clear I wanted mash potatoes. So if you decided to give this location a try make sure they give you what you ordered before you leave."}
{"text":"Came here the other day & must say they have improved their customer service skills. Ordered without hassle & got my order very quickly to my surprise though it was extremely busy at the time. Food tasted great as it should. Improvement in the decor also very nice and modern look this kfc location has."}
{"text":"This is a by far the worst KFC in life!! Just ordered four meals only to get home, and find out they forgot the biscuits, on ALL FOUR MEALS!!! WTF?????? Because of this I am done eating fast food. Every place always forgets something. It never fails!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst kfc ever... Only ordered one meal that included One piece chicken, a chicken little(small chix sandwich) two strips and a biscuit. What I got was two strips, a biscuit and a the chicken little buns for the sandwich wrapped up in foil.. I'm super understanding, so if u leave out my piece of chix fine ill deal with it, but how can u Forget to put in the chicken in a chicken sandwich!!! And proceed to wrap in up in foil like its ready to sell...it wasn't busy at all and it's very disappointing to see such bad service at this kfc."}
{"text":"At the drive thru I was told to hold on one minute.......after 10 minutes (and a whole bunch of mad people behind me) I asked if they were ready yet....\"well actually, we are out of chicken....it'll be another 10 minutes or so\".....wow, kfc is out of chicken....I'm going to see if Taco Bell is out of tacos....I live close and this is on my way from work.....but I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"They ran out of plates here!  We ate in the store, and had to eat off of napkins because of this.. ugh!

KFC, I love your chicken, but c'mon, stock up! lol."}
{"text":"Closets KFC, service is not always great. They have a lot of kids who work there. But I have to give credit to one employee (will get his name) he truly provided great service, he was friendly and kind. He took the time to get my large order and verified it was correct. Big difference from my prior experiences. I also noticed the store was much much cleaner compared to this past summer."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst locations you can go to. It's trashy and the food taste like ass. One time I went thru didn't even have chicken ? It's retarded find another place somewhere faaar away hopefully."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst KFC that could possibly exist in the World. I'd much rather take my business elsewhere. Every time I have gone to this establishment they NEVER have anything, biscuits no \" we only have chicken\", Mac and Cheese \" no we only have chicken\", Pot Pies  \"No Ma'am we only have chicken\". I haven't been there after 2 times of this happening, they have unfortunately lost my business."}
{"text":"Dining room is nasty like it has not been cleaned the whole day. Cashier seemed a bit put off when we said we needed more time. She didn't ask for here or to go so when she brought to go boxes I told her it was for dining in she took the boxes and put them on a tray. Food was too hot eat and burned my wife's mouth. Other the chicken was its normal goodness."}
{"text":"ok i went there again in a rush need something quick hit the drive thru the sandwich was of course chicken w/lettace and tomato the person working at the drive thru window informed me this location does not offer tomatos wtf fine give me the fricken chicken sandwich w/out the frigin tomato .......................................UNBELIVEABLE"}
{"text":"Friendly front counter, food taste better than they look
Tasty crispy chicken sandwich
Get the sandwich."}
{"text":"There was no baked chicken and we aren't going to wait 15minutes for more to be made.
MISTAKE. The fried chicken gave us intestinal distress. I will be contacting the Dept. of Health and NOT going to this establishment again. Contacting KFC does nothing."}
{"text":"This KFC is in a lousy location. The employees are poorly trained. The whole place is skuzzy. On several occasions I have gone there only to find a sign that said closed due to lack of employees. Messes up."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY!!!

We were here today to get some chicken. Before we tasted any chicken we were disgusted by the condition of the retaurant. Why was the health Department not involved yet? Chicken pieces are launch on the floor, paper trash all over the place, food tray had crumbles on all of them

I would give them zero star just because they didn't clean up their floor..."}
{"text":"Not worth the price, quality, or service. When we went through the drive thru, I had to repeat myself three times. Than I asked how much tenders would be on their own, and suddenly I hear two different voice on the speaker, one asking me to repeat myself and then other saying that they have to charge me for a three piece tender. I finished ordering and my total would be at the window. 
We only ordered two kids meals and three tenders, and the tenders have no sides. It was $16?!?!?! What also surprised me is that they gave us Sierra mists with both kids meals, as we asked for, but they still put Capri suns in the boxes. And our receipt, which I had to ask for, said we wanted this wide variety of sauces, which we were never given a choice of. 
This place needs to greatly improve their customer service, order taking, and pricing above all. $5 for a kids meal?!???!?!!! Will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"After such a bad experience in 2016 over and over; I thought I would try them one more time in 2017. Glad I did the young man was so happy that I was there and made me feel as if I was family. Plus you have BBQ sauce in stock made it will be a good sign!"}
{"text":"Yes, I visit the Colonel on occasion. It's not my fault; it's a well known fact that \"he puts an addictive chemical in his chicken that makes ya crave it fortnightly\" (so says Stuart Mackenzie - props if you know who I'm talking about). Anyway, this KFC location is alright. It's A-Ok.. The store isn't overly clean, but it's not filthy either. The staff is friendly enough. And, the food is generally hot and fresh. So, when you get that craving for the Colonel's secret recipe, this location is a solid choice."}
{"text":"No chicken at kfc. Seriously at 9pm on a weekday I pulled up to the drive-thru and was presented with a mumbling unintelligible female voice stating that they were, \"out of chicken, but if I wanted to wait 20 minutes they would make some more.\" I responded all chicken? Your out of all chicken? To which she responded, \"yeah.\" Wow, what an experience a KFC with no Chicken."}
{"text":"Look, it's KFC, not some michael simon restaurant, but even so, I was unimpressed.

I went to this KFC for lunch pm 5/22/2014.

Knock # 1 is the sticky floor. I don't want my shoes sticking to the floor because someone forgot to clean up completely some spilled soda. It's gross, and is a level of cleanliness that is easy to avoid.

#2, the soda machine was broken. When I purchase a fountain soda I want to be able to mix and match my soda's, not need the employee working the register filling up my pop, and adding my ice.

#3 I ordered the grilled chicken combo, but received fried chicken. It doesn't take much to look at the actual receipt, and shouldn't be a really difficult issue to cover in like the first two hours of training.

The food was KFC quality, which isn't bad, you get what you pay for, no surprises. The location is pretty convenient, but the wait for my food approached unreasonable.

Would recommend once every 4 months at best."}
{"text":"Wow... We ordered 8 pieces of chicken mashed potatoes and coleslaw and asked for white meat on 4 pieces of the eight, since no one in the family eats drumsticks or wings and the total cost was 37$ that's expensive for chicken!I don't remember it costing so much! Nice people and good chicken but not even a drink is included so don't think we could make it back here for a quick bite to eat! Sorry KFC but you ate way over priced!"}
{"text":"This place sucks. I've given it multiple chances. Always out of something you want, slow service, busy all the time (for what reason i dont know).

I attempted to get a 3 piece meal with a breast thigh and leg. The cashier kept asking me white or dark meat. I finally just said white meat as i couldnt get it through his skull that i wanted those 3 specific pieces which is obviously a mix of white and dark.

2 stars only because while everything else is crap about this place, the food quality is consistent with KFCs all around and the employee was friendly albeit dense as a brick wall.

Won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Worst customer service of any KFC I've been to, such a shame bc I recently moved into the area and eat kfc frequently.  I ordered a family meal in original but they said they only had thighs in but would give me breasts for an upcharge and we're not willing toake any exceptions even though they were completely out of drumsticks.  Now I don't know if anyone else has kids but u know kids only want drumsticks and won't eat any other peices. Then she insists on me ordering other flavors, I told her that we weren't interested in getting those other flavors, we wanted original. Them she began to yell over me telling me \"well that's what we have so if you don't want it to bad we can't help you\".  WOW I then told her that wasn't very nice and asked to speak to the manager, she said \" I am the manager Erin and theres nobody else u can talk to\".  I told her I was very appalled and have never been treated or spoken to in such a rude manner, especially by some place IM spending my money at.  I asked the other cashier I'd he could write down her name so I could make a formal complaint and she told him \"No dont write down anything for him\" . When she finally came to the window I asked for her regional managers she refused and began raising her voice at me again , and said \" I'm the store manager I don't care who you try to complain to\" and closed the window on us...SMH KFC has definitely failed in allowing someone so obnoxious and unprofessional to represent their company and even worse as a manager, Kentucky Fried Chicken you have to do better look at the reviews of your customers and you'll see...you just lost another customer because of your staff"}
{"text":"I hate to tag on but the drive through is very slow. The person that took my order seemed confused. I asked for a K6 with a Dr Pepper. She replied, ok what do you want to drink. Then she said \"what else\". 

She ask me what sauce I wanted and I ask for BBQ. They gave my hot sauce instead. The food was typical of most kfc restaurants."}
{"text":"I come here about once a week. I always order the grilled chicken, macaroni and cheese, green beans, corn. Once they mixed up my macaroni and cheese for mashed potatoes and gravy, which I don't care for. I ended up throwing that away. I never have liked reconstituted mashed potatoes and never will. No matter who makes it. Yes, the drive up is slower than Wendy's or McDonalds. But I just know not to go there when I'm in a huge huge hurry. I usually come at around 230 or 3 p.m. when it's not too busy. But during the times that I have come when there is a line, it does seem to take quite a while."}
{"text":"this is the worst chicken I have ever had!  it was salty and greasy!  I ended up throwing it out!  After spending $32.00 on a bucket of chicken!!!! no sides, just the chicken!  and it was terrible !  DO NOT GO HERE.  what a dissappointment!"}
{"text":"Quick service, fresh food, just wish that they had the A&W back. The A&W on tap and cheese curds here were fantastic. Oh well, whats done is done."}
{"text":"This is a terrible restaurant.  After having been a few times, thinking that it may have been just a bad day to be there, I now know that this is their standard of performance.  Staff have no idea why they're there.  Food is warmish at best and seems to be left over and sitting there for hours.  They constantly have menu items that are not available due to \"running out\".  There are food chunks in the heavily watered down gravy.  The chicken is floppy and definitely not freshly made.  And yet it takes FOREVER to get the order and is always missing items.  How does one miss putting fries in a meal combo?  Save your money.  The Colonel would be disgusted."}
{"text":"Terrible service, messy lobby, chickens obviously been cooked a long time ago but still being served. Avoid like the plague!"}
{"text":"I went here on 02/27/2017 at about 7:00PM to pick up some chicken for my family. 

I ordered two 10 pieces for $12 each and 8 biscuits for $4, totaling $28 plus some tax. I wasn't paying attention and the guy charged my card $45. I pointed it out and the cashier admitted he made a mistake. They made it right and gave me my change, so no big deal. I get it, mistakes happen. 

However, when I get home I notice the chicken skin is soggy and old. It looks disgusting and my kids don't even want to eat it. It's to the point to where the skin is so soggy that it looks like it was dropped in water. There is nothing remotely crunchy about this chicken. Then, the inside is so dry that it tastes like it's been sitting there for hours under a heat lamp. 

I just have to say that the reason I am so disappointed is because I work 12 hours shifts and at this point I am way too exhausted to cook but that's besides the point. So, I decide to call and speak to the manager but the line is disconnected! What?? I couldn't believe it so I called from two other cell phones and the same problem happens. It rings once and hangs up. Doesn't even connect. This is completely unacceptable.

Next time I want chicken, I'll go to Raising Cane's and get fresh chicken and awesome customer service."}
{"text":"Ok here's some insider tips. Someone very close to me worked here for a bit and it's disgusting, plus they treat their employees like total shit so you might as well not support this place. The coleslaw is unsanitary, it's mixed by hand with the employees only wearing a thin layer of gloves in a cheap big plastic yellow
tub (however the coleslaw goes up to the arms). The chicken sits there forever and the employees are told to scrap up every crusty old piece of chicken before giving out the fresh stuff. Everything is frozen and gross but that's a given. Plus the pot pies have a small possibility of actually having bones in them. Don't support this trash fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"Pretty clean place. Was greeted and acknowledge right away. It had been a while since I had been there. Service was quick. I will come back to eat here again."}
{"text":"Never have a problem here at all. We normally go for lunch getting 5 dollar deals, or the go meal. They always get it correct and are friendly about it. 

The cashier is normally prepping something, but as soon as you are ready to order they get right to the register. Really good customer service for the past year or so!"}
{"text":"Went to this location Weds. evening 5/30 to grab dinner.  Chicken was good, but cole slaw was spoiled and made my husband violently ill.  Literally, he was violently puking his guts out 4 hours after dinner!  He got so sick for the rest of that night that he could not get any sleep and had to call off work the next day, and he never, ever misses work!  Will never eat at this place again - and I mean never, ever!"}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviewers that say this place is nasty. It's dirty and needs a do-over. The lady who takes the drive thru orders is rude and unfriendly. The chicken is dripping grease and tasteless. The mashed potatoes are from a mix and not homemade. I wish we had a Popeye's closer or even a Mr. Chicken."}
{"text":"This KFC must be one of the worst in Calgary. The service consistently sucks -painfully slow (even worse since they down sized to one cash register from 2 or 3).
Every time we go there somethings goes wrong from undercooked chicken, out of stock ,have to wait for chicken to be cooked and my biggest complaint is they send out coupons or have a major advertising on TV for something and you go to the Crowfoot location and they are always out of stock of something advertised such as zingers, waffle fries and as of today original recipe onion rings. They were even out of white meat one day!
 
Seriously I don't know who orders the stock but they need to be fired. Or if the warehouse can't get the stock to the stores. The first rule of business is if you run an ad campaign,  have the stock!

Then when you comment or complain the staff usually the same Phillopino lady just shrugs her shoulders. Today I asked that they substitute poutine for the out of stock onion rings, I was told we would have to pay $2.00 for the cheese and this was with an attitude that she was doing us a favor which they certainly weren't. 

I will not spend another cent at this restaurant and hope you won't either. Maybe if their sales drop their attitudes may change!"}
{"text":"After a very frustrating experience with another kfc we came here and walked out within 3 minutes with dinner ready to go. Not only that the staff was friendly and joked around with me a put a smile on my face where I had been very irritated before. After a long drive home from vacation it was a welcome relief. Food was hot and \"finger licking good\" as the saying goes. Thank you .   I would like to add that this is our closest kfc to our home and without fail everytime we come the experience is very similar to the one I shared.  Quick, friendly service.  :)"}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars. Got the order completely wrong. Left stuff out of the bag that they charged me for. Like I'm gonna drive all the way back there for missing items in the heat. And they want $15 an hour. What a joke. Learn how to do your job correct to earn the money you're already getting. More than pissed."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong I love this place but today was enough to make me say no more chances, first order of hot wings were under cooked called back got them replaced and even waited 20min for them to be fresh took them home and guess what, still under cooked, I'm thinking their fry oil isn't hot enough to cook these hot wings throughly."}
{"text":"This could be a five star location if they hired more staff!!! You can wait longer in line to be waited on than it takes to prepare the food."}
{"text":"Seriously. Worst. KFC. Ever. I hate chain restaurants. Especially fast food. My boys love KFC and on nights that we're running around crazy, I give them quick and easy food. Every time I've been here, I've been unsatisfied. My last experience here was my worst. Waited in the drive thru for 20 minutes as the only car. If it were only me, I would have laughed and drove away. Since my kiddos had their hearts set on this crap chicken, I felt obligated to stay. After an eternity of waiting, it was cold and our order was all fuckered up. There was only one table inside and we were the only car in the drive-thru. That was it. Certainly not convenient, cheap, or tasty. The employees have all been some serious twats also. I don't believe any positive reviews came from actual customers."}
{"text":"Try to go there today before work had a little extra time to sit down and take some food to my coworkers but apparently it was to much for the employee in different outfits than the rest idono if she's the shift manager or shift leader but her attitude was way over board at witch I had to go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Came here at noon to get a family meal, of course we ordered chicken... they tell me it will take 15min for crispy chicken and 10 for original.  How do you not have any chicken ready at noon with only 2 cars in the parking lot and I'm the only one in the drive thru.  Just terrible...."}
{"text":"No longer returning to this kfc after today the guy at the drive window didn't even have the DECENCY to fill up my 3$ drink all the way! Maybe if you hire new staff if you want your restaurant to succeed"}
{"text":"Just ordered a fill up meal.   2pc leg and thigh.  I asked for 2 thighs.  Order was incorrect.  Also didn't get the cookie.  No big deal but when I tried to call the numbers on the receipt, both numbers not valid.  Not coming here again."}
{"text":"Went in to get dinner for the family service was great at first, Tyler help us immediately with taking our order. Then there was the usual kitchen banter while they were getting orders ready. 

The manager came out and asked for grilled chicken. Ok fine you need food the nice kid Tyler that help us out turned into a punk and said out loud (for me and 2 other customers in the resturant to hear him) I've got it in you stupid b*tch. Then proceeded to repeat him self 2 more times. 

I promptly asked for my money back and I got an attitude from him and he stormed off to get the manager. When the manager came out I was in absolute shock that this little punk was cussing at his older female manager. I absolutley refuse to return to this location until the staff is changed."}
{"text":"I love KFC and often want to splurge on a huge bucket with sides here. But I can't ... Because they don't have the chicken in stock, it isn't ready, they may have to stay longer, or some other excuse. After three attempts, I stopped coming. Instead, I now go three miles to the Kens Butcher on Northport.  It shouldn't be that hard to do what you advertise."}
{"text":"My experience was through the drive-thru. I was immediately greeted and my food was prepared/packed right away. The lady at the drive-thru window was friendly and my order was accurate. I came home to hot pipping chicken with some sides. The quality of the food was good for the price. There are many value meal options to choose from."}
{"text":"Chicken was under done. Had to repeat myself I dont know how many times thru the drive thru. Shut it down. Rude service. Heard they still supplies and sell them in the hood. Selling hot wings in plastic bags and stealing. I stopped going. No ethics. Just hoodrat location."}
{"text":"All these years and I've never been here and will be another number of years before I am back.

I've lived in Cornelius for 22 years and KFC has been here for most of that time. Never got around to trying it till today when I had to run home to pick up something I had forgotten and needed at the office.

Pulled in and only two cars ahead of me.10 minutes later I place my order at the speaker and 5 minutes later I pick it up.  15 minutes from start to finish.

By the time I ordered, I decided on something that would be quick so I ordered the $5 Chicken Breast Special, Extra Crispy with Fries and tea.

Took it back to the office to my desk and it was totally devoid of either taste or texture or in other words, typical KFC.  That's not to say there are not some good ones out there because there are but this is not one of them."}
{"text":"The food really sick had a poutine and on my way home to throw it up. Disgusting the store is always dirty and the staff looks like they don't even want to be there.  To top it all off they play the most ridiculous music for an eating establishment. I will never go back there I am so turned off!!!!"}
{"text":"This location is a COLOSSAL SUCK FEST. The chicken place that never has any chicken. Since DAY ONE of being open, I've been consistently asked to pull around and wait for my food. No matter what time of day, no matter what I order. It's truly fascinating. The fun part is, they usually inform you of this 20 minute average wait time AFTER you've already paid. It's frustrating beyond belief. I can order ANYTHING from the new KFC on Ann/Decatur without incident and that will be my new go to location."}
{"text":"We live pretty close to here so we used to go pretty often.   Out of probably 15 visits these last couple years.  They have gotten our order right once.   The best part is when I drive off then have to wait forever for the car in front of me to move to tell them they forgot something!!!!!   I never write reviews but seriously you need to have your people trained.  How is that possible to mess up that often."}
{"text":"The service I received stood out in my mind, hence why this review of this fast food joint. I came on a Tuesday and was deliberating my order.  When I came in, there was a long line up and I was dismayed.  However, the line up quickly shortened due to the efficiency of the service and I put my order in quickly, even before I made a decision on what to order.   I was either going for the four piece meal or the three piece meal.  The lady at the counter was very informative and advised me that it was the Tuesday deal and that I could buy that deal and add extra pieces at a much lower price. They did run out of white meat, but I heard them offer extra dark meat if people can't wait.  Now, with respect to the actual meal, the chicken is really small, like chicken wings.  I ordered the poutine and it was fine, but not the best.  I really just wanted some cheese and some gravy for the chicken skin, that's why I ordered it.  I rate this place a four star because of the efficient service."}
{"text":"I been coming to this specific location for years and I've had my highs and lows with customer service. Most of the time, the food is hot and good. Sometimes, not so much. Today's experience....The cashier was not friendly and did have the \"go-above-and-beyond\" attitude. The food was good."}
{"text":"Service was super slow, the employees are extremely rude, and they forgot to give me my drinks. I've never had an experience quite like this before where when you get your food and you think you're done, they slam the sliding door in your face and you don't even get your drinks bc \"You're in the ghetto, and we is busy with people in here.\""}
{"text":"This location is a POS.  They are always out of hot sauce. This is mind boggling. How can you be out of hot sauce when that's your primary condiment!?  It is always filthy as well. Like disgustingly sticky and filthy everywhere."}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst KFC. Thirty minute wait for what seemed like day old food. Everyone that ordred had something wrong. We never send food back so we just left. They didn't have a high chair it must have been stolen according to a employee.  Male cashier was talking about how the sporks reminded him of CCDC(JAIL)."}
{"text":"Kids wanted KFC tonight. So I said why not. 

1. The adult combos are the size of the kids combo in Cali. Absolutely ridiculous. 

2. I asked for fries with my meals and got mashed potatoes but after reading other posts this isn't uncommon. 

3. It cost 23.00 and my kids were still hungry. And they are not big kids. I ordered 3 meals!!!!

I WILL NEVER GO BACK HERE AGAIN. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME"}
{"text":"Hands down, the worst food experience of my entire life.  Got a 2pc meal, after finishing first piece of chicken, went to grab second only to discover the longest hair you've ever seen in your life wrapped around the bottom of it 

Being grossed out, I asked for my money back only to be denied and offered a replacement piece.   The replacement piece also had hair.  

Will never return.  Which is sad, I love me some KFC."}
{"text":"9039 W Olive Avenue
Peoria, Arizona 85345
What a huge disappointment! I have received coleslaw donations from them for many of the past years that our Rescue organization has held their annual meeting/picnic. This year I went to the manager, Shawn (spelling?) a week ahead of time to see if they could give me a discount on 2 catering trays of coleslaw, since they have been increasing less generous over the years. Didn't ask for any free ones like we had gotten before, just a discount. He assured me that he could and I could pick them up the following Saturday (March 14) at 5 PM the day before the event.. When I got there at 5PM as told, guess what, no Shawn, no coleslaw and NOBODY knew anything about it. The staff there said no problem, I could get it from another store and they would call ahead. The other store would be just 10 minutes away. Well, the other store was over 10 miles away, in Surprise. So it would have been only 10 minutes if I could do 60 MPH on Bell Rd at Saturday afternoon at 5 PM. Seriously? It was over 30 minutes and when I got there, no discount to speak of. Turned out 2 trays was not enough anyway and I ended up making some more of my own from a copycat recipe I found on the web. Interestingly, people liked mine better, too. No more KFC for me!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru and ordered a a famous bowl and popcorn chicken meal. The popcorn chicken was old and hard. You can tell they had been sitting for a while. And as for the potato wedges they were so old and hard. You couldn't even take a bite. There wasn't enough chicken on the famous bowl either maybe 3 or 4 pieces. It was totally disappointing. I've been here once before and walked in even though it took a long time then the food wasn't as bad. My little guy was super disappointed in his food. And so was I"}
{"text":"Place was filthy. Restroom looked like it has not been cleaned.  Food was not good,  tasted like it has been sitting out. Tables and chairs needed to be wiped down."}
{"text":"Luckily I had cash on me since that's all they were accepting. Ordered then was told they only have original. Huh? I don't get why if you are running low on chicken wouldn't you start making more before a customer orders. Was told it would be 20 minutes decided to wait since I really was craving extra crispy chicken. Turned out to be 40 minutes!!! At this point I'm expecting some freebies coming with our order. Food comes out to our car no thank you no sorry for the wait. KFC needs to straighten out their restaurants."}
{"text":"Well we all know KFC is known for \"Finger Licking Good\" but we may not always have known them for quality service. This location is in the Spectrum Mall Parking Lot that offers dine in, carry out and drive thru. I frequently visit this location to pick up lunch for the office. I have only used the drive thru once which was a quick nice experience the other times I did carry out. The interior is nice and the location is well kept with cleanliness but I have been disappointed in getting wrong orders or there not being enough chicken. The staff is very friendly and acknowledge/greet everyone who walks through the door. They great about honoring coupons and ringing in orders. Matter of fact they repeat the orders so it throws me off when my orders are wrong. My very last experience was during lunch right at 11:15am. I ordered grilled only Chicken for the office and there was not enough which was strange since I was only ordering 10 pieces. The friendly cashier told me the wait would be 20 mins so I decided to wait. He offered me a drink for my wait. Well I declined his offer even though that was a kind gesture. After playing the waiting game it took 40 mins for my chicken to be ready. Not sure why or how this would have taken so long but it did. 

The food was good which kept the office happy though they really need to get the service part down when it comes to the food. Once they take care of this I see more stars added to their ratings."}
{"text":"Stop by to get a 8 piece meal on Sunday night for my family and me and my son got food poison and I haven't been feeling good for three days now never come in there again."}
{"text":"This was a laughable experience. Two elderly people in front of me were trying to order - the staff couldn't fill their order because they \"had just ran out of chicken \" !!  Come on - this is KFC. !!   My order of BBQ tenders was available but when served had only minimal sauce and no packets were available.  Very disappointing!!   Another gentleman was trying to order from the Taco Bell side He ask for a menu because he couldn't make out the board.  Again - not available.  There's a reason my stock is in McD's!!"}
{"text":"1st & last time at this location...customer service is cool but what's up with the old tasting Potato wedges??!? Very disappointed :( on the bright side: the chicken strips tasted fresh.."}
{"text":"Simply awful location.  My most recent trip was at prime dinner time (6:30 on a Saturday) and they still managed to give us terribly stale food.  The biscuits were crunchy all the way through.  Seriously, how long were they out to get that way.  Completely hard.  The corn was dry and shriveled.  The \"extra crispy\" chicken was barely crispy in some parts, and mush in other parts.

Stay away from this location."}
{"text":"They are usually slow.but tonight was rediculous. If I wasn't stuck in the drive.thru area I would have driven away. The person taking my order got it wrong like 3 Times. Finally I just agreed to what they said. I guess it was servers choice tonight. I don't usually rip places like this but tonight I'm making an exception...terrible service, extremely slow drive thru, food was ehwww at best. That's it I'm doing it 1star. I'd venture to say I would give them less if possible. Next time I have the urge for some bird ill drive out of my way or go to popeyes a few miles down the road. They are seriously having issues keeping up with the demand."}
{"text":"This KFC is slow and NEVER has anything ready.  I twice went there to get the grilled chicken.  After waiting on line for 20 minutes, I was told they didn't have anymore.  You would think on a Friday night they would have planned better and cooked some up when it got low."}
{"text":"Sad you couldn't even get a simple order correct. How can you forget the sides and biscuits on a 20 piece bucket? I started to read your reviews and see it's quiet an occurrence. Yep I won't be buying from here again. Good luck with $15 an hour."}
{"text":"Went through drive thru ordered a two-piece fill up box my bread was hard as a rock you couldn't even break it comma the lady at the window was so rude gave me one pack of hot sauce slaw smelled spoiled. Will never return to this location"}
{"text":"Horrible OMG check out this leg? This has not had a bite out of it either! What is wrong with this location?"}
{"text":"Our family recently had the pleasure of eating at this establishment on March 4th, around 5:30 P.M. This is conveniently across from the hotel we were staying at. We came around peak business hours. They were understaffed, yet we received our food in a very prompt manner. No complaints on the food! It was all steaming hot and the chicken was delicious! With KFC and Taco Bell being joined together, you have PLENTY of options to choose from!

I'd like to take a minute to appreciate one of the employees at this location. I wish I got his name, but this guy was a top notch, professional employee. He was very attentive and very polite. Despite being understaffed and the lines getting noticeably longer, he kept his composure and maintained his politeness with the customers. Having worked previously as a manager in the restaurant business, I can certainly say that this employee is a true asset to this location and certainly deserves a raise if he hasn't gotten one yet!

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area! If the restaurant is still understaffed when you visit, please keep that in consideration while waiting for your food. Three guys is not enough to be taking care of drive thru orders, assembling the orders, AND taking care of dine in customers."}
{"text":"This location includes Taco Bell and it is very ran down. The staff was rude and lacking personality, which I feel in customer service is crucial. The place was a mess with over flowing garbage cans and a terrible odor."}
{"text":"I only go here when I absolutely have to and every time I dread it. I've only used the drive thru and it's a guarantee that something will be wrong with my order - either I'm given the wrong item or missing the item altogether. Ordered chips and cheese... SUPER stingy with the cheese. It's pretty ridiculous. This picture was taken right after I opened the container. Don't think I'll be coming back ever again. Customer service is also hit and miss. Sometimes you get a nice person, other times a rude person."}
{"text":"First off the smell when you walk in will knock you over, second I was greeted by a young man that was being yelled at by his manager who's name I found out was Charlotte the young man told her he needed to take my order she continued to yell about some grilled chicken when he finally got to me he apologized to me. I felt bad for him and the other employees this manager is very unprofessional and very disrespectful to the employees and customers I will not be returning to this location. 8/14/2016 @ 16:59 the location is wrong I was at 2210 email baseline Rd 85204"}
{"text":"There were only 2 cars ahead of me in the drive thru and I have been waiting for 15 mins and they still have not took my order slowest drive try experience ever... now there is no one ahead of me 3 cars behind me and still know one has taken my order. I took almost 20 min just to go through their drive thru and they weren't even busy."}
{"text":"I have been very disappointed in this KFC. The service is lousy, the employees do not have a good customer service standard. My orders are consistently wrong. After my last bad experience I wrote them an email and they didn't even respond."}
{"text":"I just get more and more disgusted every time I come to this place. Kfc used to be really good, but now the chicken is very dry, the buns aren't that great, and it has gotten pretty pricey. In all honesty its not very clean either. The only thing that's worth buying anymore is the mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"Wow. Messed up the order and forgot some of my meal. None of the phone numbers work so you can't even call them. Crazy"}
{"text":"Went through drive-thru.   Took a little bit of time, but they got me what I wanted.  Wasn't asked if I needed ketchup or anything else though and they didn't throw in utensils.  Thank goodness I wasn't going to a park or something with my bucket of dippin' greasy lardness goodness.

Of course, my GPS told me that the one on Silverado was closer to me, and then I find out that there's one right off of Eastern close to Anthem.  Damn you Garmin.

The one other thing that completely threw me off was that if you turn into the area from the side of grocery store, it looks like a 1-way outward.   Which makes no sense at all since there's an entrance to KFC on that side."}
{"text":"It's a KFC.  Nothing fantastic, nothing bad.  I will point out that Keihana (I think that's how the name is spelled) was probably one of the most efficient drive-thru people here and I like the fact that at most fast food places I have to check the order, but she actually checked for me before handing it over and found that they had not put in an order of large wedges.

I mean really.  She checked so I didn't have to do so.  And that's hella awesome.  You sometimes don't even get people that do that from curb-side service from better restaurants."}
{"text":"It's always a challenge to review a fast food chain.  I am not going to go into KFC thinking it's going to be gourmet cuisine.  I go into KFC with this mind set:  

1.) I have to feed the family and don't want to spend  a lot of money.  
2.) I need something convenient and fast.  

This is how it goes.  You can only eat Hamburgers for so long.  Now I am talking when we need to grab a quick meal after work because we don't have time to cook.  KFC does a great job of providing this alternative quick meal option.  So like I said earlier a fast food place is what it is.  I am in and I am out.  This particular KFC is actually pretty clean so that's always a plus.  So the next time you need to feed the family quick and cheap pick up some chicken and sides and don't forget the honey for the biscuits!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I have to give them props for doing a decent job and understanding, but the follow through just wasn't there.  Running a little behind and needing a quick bite to eat I decided to do the drive thru here.  

Pull up to the menu and place my order for a bowl.  Also made my request for no corn.  Drink?  Sure, I'd like a bottle of water.  Sorry, we are out.  After a back and forth that felt like it lasted a more than it should have, I decline the drink.  Or so I had thought.  I pulled up to the window to pay and get my food and the lady was profusely apologizing for not having the water and offered me water from the fountain.  No thanks, I don't do that.  After having to explain to her my allergy to corn and why I can't have any of the drinks offered on the fountain she understands.

Or so I thought.  I finally have my food in my car and make it to my destination.  After getting settled I decide to devour my food...but only after inspecting it.  Good thing I did too.  That conversation about my corn allergy went right over their heads.  Tons of corn throughout the bowl.  Not only just sitting there, but mixed in to the gravy, melted cheese, and mashed potatoes.  

Worst five dollars I have spent.  No food, no drink, no satisfaction."}
{"text":"I'm not going to go into the food here.  I'll be honest.  I wanted a quick meal during my lunch break while I was out filling up my gas and not having a lot of time I pulled in here to utilize the drive thru.  My luck that day was good as no one else was in like through the drive thru and it looked like at the time of the day no one was really in the dining room.  I was in and out of there in less than five minutes.  

I am not a fan of chicken places as it doesn't always seem appetizing to me.  I am always afraid that I am going to get a piece of tendon and that always flips my stomach.  However that did not happen this night.  For $5, you couldn't beat the deal."}
{"text":"Wanting a quick dinner we decided to come up to West View and pick from the few fast food places that they have.  A last second decision brought us here.  We didn't even go inside, we decided to use the drive thru.  Which was kind of a mistake.

Our order was simple, basically a two different preset meals with a modification to it.  Mine did come out perfectly, however the other order didn't fair to well.  Every time that my other half attempted to tell them what he wanted as his sides he kept getting cut off by them inside.  

While we pulled up and waited, I looked at the receipt and noticed that a lot of what was relayed through the speaker box at the drive thru did not appear on this receipt.  I told the better half this and he just shrugged and didn't care.  Most everything from the dipping sauce to the side he ordered was wrong.  He's not picky, I am, if this was me, we would have been here longer waiting for the corrections to be made."}
{"text":"What can you say about a KFC that hasn't already been said?  

I was in need of something quick to eat and this was on my way.  I'm always hesitant to use a drive thru as the order doesn't always come out right.  Luckily for me, this day was a little different.  

I ordered what I usually get when I come to a KFC.  With specific instruction of items to exclude.  So what surprised me was that the employee repeated my order back to me three times.  At first I thought it was odd, but when I got my food it felt more reassuring that they did that.  No problems with my food or allergies."}
{"text":"If allowed to give negative stars I would about this location.  Service has gone down drastically in the past couple months.  Encountering the GM last night it's easy to see why.  I had gone through drive thru on 9-10-15.  They gave me the wrong drink and the hardest chicken Littles That were in edible.  When I called the on duty manager Efren said he would replace the $5 box but nothing else (my order was $17) which I said was fine.  Just give your name hid says.  No problems he said.  Ha!
  I send my husband because I'm pregnant and it's 100 out in vegas even at 9 pm.  He came back with a couple of nasty thighs and a drink.  I was supposed to be replaced a $5 chicken little box.  So now I'm pissed.  You can only mess with a preggos food so many times people.  So I call, twice.  No answer.  So I drive down there.  To meet Philiciano.  Worst.  GM.  EVER.  
  He refuses to give me the measly $5 box.  When I ask for the GM number he says \"see problem is I am the GM\". So I say district manager then.  He tells me to wait a moment.  This is after I waited for him to help 4 cars in drive they before assisting me.  He then comes back and says \"after calling Efren I'll replace the box\" serious.  So after pretty much making me look like a con for 10 minutes he comes back to say I was right.  Imagine that?  The customer, right???!!!  So I tell him I still want the DM number and guess what happens next???  This horrible excuse for a GM says \"if you're still calling the DM I'm calling the cops I'm not serving you\". The employee Casey was awesome!  He TRIED to fix it, knowing I was pregnant.  Tried to say \"go sit in your car ma'am I'll bring it right out.\"  And the GM STOPS HIM and reprimands him for helping the customer!  He said \"I'm the boss you will not help her\". On an insane ego power trip..OVER A $5 FILL UP BOX.  Unbelievable horrible service. Leaving a pregnant woman hungry for two days straight.  Making  your employee look stupid for trying to make it right.  It's no wonder over half the KFC locations are closed in vegas now.  If they keep Philiciano on this one will close next."}
{"text":"Filthy and bad service. We didn't notice until after we had ordered that the place was disgusting. When we got our cups we proceeded to the drink counter and there was soda spilled all over the counter and the floor. Our shoes stuck to the floor. There was trash everywhere and overflowing out of the trash can. It was gross.

When we received our order, I was missing sauce for mine and my husband had been given a completely different item then he requested. He asked for a zinger box and they gave him one of the $5 meals instead. 

The staff was arguing constantly about who should be doing what task and they weren't even busy. They were swearing across the kitchen at each other and then just standing around chatting if they had no customers placing orders.

It was our first time there and it will most definitely be our last. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"After buying dinner for $14 with drinks included they were out of Pepsi and when I told them they said just pick another drink. I told them I don't drink any of their other flavors, and asked for a drink refund. They refused and just said sorry we don't do refunds. But they do screw you over, paid for drinks and got none! WTF These people r low lifes!"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed in the service provided on my last visit to this location.  I will admit it was a little before 5 pm on Friday (today) and the line was long at the drive through. The wait was also very long. I did not receive all that I ordered.  I called KFC to report this and the attitude  of the manager was  \"so what\" and she did not even ask for the name of the person who waited on me. I can forgive the forgotten item.  I can't  forgive the attitude  of management.  I will not be returning to that location. What happened to taking pride in what you do?"}
{"text":"Poor service, long wait.  The cashier was making the plates and took 30 minutes to take our order.  First and last time I'll be coming here."}
{"text":"Ok Here are just a few of the reasons I would not go here again: (I have been here two times within the last two weeks and each time it was horrible) 

1. The quality of the service of the employees is definitely lacking. Then there is the addition that they don't quite understand me to 100 % because of language barriers. 

2. The restaurant is very dirty, the floors aren't seeped and maintained regularly, as well as the tables aren't wiped off either.

3.  Even after telling one of the employees that I find it quite disgusting that there are pieces of chicken on the floor in the kitchen, they were not removed. 

4. The food was always cold, and the portions for the gravy etc are a complete joke. 

5. The excuse that I received from an employee when I asked her why the door was open (where all of the warm chicken etc is stored) for more then 7 mins!  I was told:

I just made some fresh chicken and I was about to put it in there.   There is absolutely no reason that door should be open for 7 minutes, and I'm sure that's a good reason why the food is always cold..."}
{"text":"This is a KFC Taco Bell combo, but it is mainly a KFC place with Taco Bell just tacked on. A lot of Taco Bell's things weren't available here. Things were organized weird. No Mountain Dew or Baja Blast, nor any freezies. Neither were a few more things available either. The soda was completely watered down. The available Taco Bell food was average. And the cashier was super friendly with me messing up with trying to get rid of all Canadian coins."}
{"text":"Horrible music and very in-conducive to eating! Bad for digestion. We had that \"rushed\" feeling due to the music and I actually wanted to finish my meal as soon as possible so we could get out of there."}
{"text":"Seriously, worst KFC.....EVERY TIME. Chicken: hard and been sitting in a warmer for probably 4 hours. Drive thru: Doesn't even say hi. Receipt....what receipt, we're gonna jack up your order so why would we give you a receipt? Order: NEVER right.

I don't know why I keep going back....oh ya because most KFC's have their stuff together, but not this one. It's never clean in there, there's almost ALWAYS homeless people hanging around and someone in the parking lot working on their car. 

I'm done with this ghetto location, if I want KFC I'll make the drive to a nicer location where they won't eff up my food."}
{"text":"If you going to use the Drive-Thru at this KFC .....STOP..!!!, Don't waist your time and don't even think about it. You NEVER get your order right. Either they put wrong item you did not ask for or something is missing when you get home. Order taker has no clue how to take an order. Even today 5/14/2014 with manager looking over his shoulder, order taker screwed up. AGAIN..!! 

       \"The order taker needs to know what's on the menu and sadly, need to know how to work the keypad for taking order..!!! \"

Never Again..Done with this KCF.

{"text":"I work nearby and stop here every once in awhile. Always great service. Always extremely friendly staff."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in on March 11th in the evening, it was a very slow day the lobby was empty and the tables were dirty and floor was filthy. When ordering I asked the cashier to repeat the order and she looked annoyed when asked. We got our order right away but the chicken seem to be there for a while because it was cold and soggy. Potato wedges were also cold, I rarely go to KFC for the same reason."}
{"text":"Seriously, enough is enough.

I have now been to this place 4 times and the last time will be the LAST time! Every single time I have gone to this location there are only 2 things I can rely on..

1) the service will be crappy
2) the portions will be cheap and small

Do these people think that by constantly shorting people on the portions that they're paying for that they are somehow saving money?? You may save 20 or 30 cents here and there, but you are pissing off and driving away regular repeat customers. Brilliant.

It;s a pity. I enjoy KFC's product and was so psyched to have one so close to the house, but it sucks to always get home and see you've been short changed...EVERY SINGLE TIME!

No mas for me.

{"text":"Stopped by while visiting friends on that side of town today and bought a bucket of chicken. It came to $12.98 for a 10 piece bucket. Was then given $2 in change since they were \"out of ones\". lol Seriously?? 

Isn't there a bank (Chase) right in the same parking lot area? Why wouldn't you go buy some from the bank when you started getting low. This comes across as real bush league. That's just what I love, more change.

Knocking it down a star. You're a major, worldwide franchise. Stock ones please.

2 stars."}
{"text":"I often come here for food and it always seems like something is wrong, but today they went to far. An employee (clearly new) took my order from the drive thru register I figured the front two registered were out of order. However a few minutes later a more experienced employee, to my shock used the front register, it wasn't long before I realized something was wrong, people who came in later then me were getting their food faster. I never got my food and was to angry to ask about it, I can also say half of the employees here are very obviously on drugs."}
{"text":"Very bad experience at drive thru. Woman that took our order was super rude and rushed us through our whole order and by the time we got to the window it was even worse. 
She shouted that we were giving her attitude and messed up our order because she was rushing us and they left the window open. So we heard everything they were shouting back and forth to each other. 
Then my boyfriend had to walk in because they forgot 3 items. Ridiculous"}
{"text":"I want to give this place two stars but the staff are too nice so we'll round up. It's often a little dirty. They have been out of the original recipe sandwich for months. They don't sell actual pieces of chicken. On the upside, they have the vegetarian sandwich which I adore but is disappearing from everywhere else. The taco bell stuff has all been fine. The staff are friendly and super quick. I've never had a wait time."}
{"text":"KFC is trying something new. I've been missing Taco Bell at this location for cheap work lunch when I'm in a real hurry. I went to check this place out when a guy stopped by work with coupons to let us know they were open. I went for lunch and found it pretty chaotic (probably due to being freshly opened and new staff). You order at one end like Subway, they put together your food, then you pay. They have chicken fillet burgers, crispy strips, burritos, rice bowls, and salads. The sides are salad, waffle-cut fries, and coleslaw. It's really not so different from a normal KFC only no bone-in chicken (which was always true for this location anyway). I got a double sandwich for like $4.99 and made it a combo for $3. I noticed last minute there are pickles on the sandwich and I have an irrational fear of pickles so I managed to stop them from being added. I should have known \"special sauce\" on the burger would be full of pickles as well, but it didn't register and nobody mentioned it even after I told them no pickles. I got the waffle fries as the side and a pepsi cup for the drink. They have Pepsi's rip-off of the Coke machine where you pick your own drink and then flavors like lime or vanilla. Options are much more limited, though. No diet mountain dew... boooo... Got a normal diet pepsi. I used a coupon for a free cheesecake. It all cost about $10. They also give you a loyalty card, if you buy 11 combos you get a free main. 

The bun was totally average. I watched the chicken come from the fryer fresh but it has no real crispness. The special sauce is the same nasty pickle-tasting thousand island garbage that every other chain calls special sauce (good if you like that sort of thing, but I hate it). The waffle fries were ok. I got half left-overs from the previous batch and half fresh. The fresh ones were crisp and salty and great. The older ones required a lot of chewing. The cheesecake was bad, but it was free Very airy, a little grainy, heavy on the artificial berry flavor. I'd say the food is average KFC fare. Don't get too excited about it. I'll go back to try the burrito and may update then."}
{"text":"talk about FALSE advertising !!  FTC and Truthinadvertising.org why don't you do something about KFC's advertising. Just go buy their newly advertised $20 family meal.. once you get off the toilet from the horrible food stop this company from giving you something totally different from what you see on their TV ad's..  If I was smart I would have paid with my CC, if I had I would have stopped payment. Trying to deal with the store and customer service on Main St. & Power rd. KFC location is an indictment of our (un)educational system. 
You idiots at the FTC, PLEASE go buy this $20 family meal. go home and be furious and once you and your family members get of the potty from numerous bouts of diarrhea.. Put on your big boy pants and finally DO SOMETHING. LIKE YOUR JOB   !!

stay away from KFC and to really get scared read the nutritional information.. true, it goes through you from one end to the other but a huge waste of $$$.."}
{"text":"Took 30 minutes for 20 pieces of chicken. Ridiculous! Never coming here again.  After all, KFC is a FAST food joint and FRIED CHICKEN is in the name of their lousy establishment. Workers are lazy and incompetent - next time I'll fry my own chicken."}
{"text":"Second time I have come here and they say it will be 30 mins for chicken cause they are out. Not to mention I stood at the counter for 5 mins watching 3 guys argue about who was gonna help me before they told me they are out of chicken. Terrible service. 1 star is too much for this location"}
{"text":"Like everyone else on here, time to get my your food and the customer service is horrible... i have worked in the restaurant business for 15+years, and this KFC location  is on my top 3 of worst places to go eat.. 20min wait for a pot pie, SMH ... It's called fast food for a reason, and to top it off, I was the only one in the drive threw... I would give this love negative stars if I could... if this was my place and my reviews, I would be very upset..."}
{"text":"Shea & Breanne were awesome with their friendly customer service when they took our orders on $2.50 (two pieces of dark chicken & a biscuit) Tuesday. Thanks to Shea who greeted us and ensured our visit went well and to Breanna who took our orders and served them to us. As we were leaving they thanked us for stopping in. Well done you guys!  See you all again!Go 

Hook 'em!"}
{"text":"Came in to grab some lunch and the whole place smelled like somebody just took a huge dump. Was 2nd in line for about 5 mins, because the cashier was talking to her boyfriend, who was in front of me. Literally standing there talking about going to see a movie after work. After I place my order, I go to wash my hands, couldn't get in because an employee locked himself in the multi stall restroom. So I stand there for another 5 mins and wait to see this dude, the size of a semi truck walk out, stretch and tell me he advises I let it air out for a few mins. I go to wash my hands and almost pass out from the stench. 
By the time I got to my food, it was cold. The chicken look like it had been fried for about 8 mins to long. Definitely won't be back here. No clue how this place passed its state inspection..."}
{"text":"y'all forgot my cookie ???

Constructive criticism: communicate with the customer more, train more on customer service skills"}
{"text":"We were tired and hungry and didn't want to drive far. Ordered a 3 piece meal and chicken tenders and it was hardly edible. Ended up throwing most of it away. The chicken was dried out so bad that it wasn't worth eating. The wing had zero meat on it.  The mashed potatoes tasted like out-of -the box instant dried potatoes that you mix in water with.  The meal cost me $17.07 for 2 people and no drinks. What a total waste of money. Ugh.  This is a review written by a person who has never given a 1 star review."}
{"text":"So I've been here half hour waiting for my food. They are serving everyone else because we have chicken bowls -_-"}
{"text":"Terrible packaging of food To Go. Ordered a family meal and when I got home to set up dinner the small paper bag that the mash potato and gravy were placed in was soaked and ripped. It turns out the small gravy contains was placed underneath the larger size mashed potato and the lid for gravy broke and soaked our bag of food. What a mess! I live only minutes away and was careful with our KFC plastic bag so I'm sure it was not my handling that created the mess. If you look closely in the pic, the entire center of the gravy lid broke off and sunk into the gravy along with the mash potato tub that was placed on top of the gravy. After a long day of work and chauffeuring my kids to there piano lessons etc... I'm now feeling like this was not the best convenient dinner choice for the night."}
{"text":"walk in, looked a the price and walked out. over charging is bad. we know you have to pay you Colonel Sanders actors, dont pass the buck to us"}
{"text":"Although the wait was a little long, Dillon was very helpful and made a good recommendation, The Famous Bowl. I tried it in other locations after that but the portion is very smaller. He definitely hooked it up! All smiles and very good customer service! Definitely will come by again! :)"}
{"text":"Everytime I have gone to this particular KFC my order is never right. Today instead of getting 10 pieces my bucket had 8 and they forgot to include the chocolate chip cookies.  There was no napkins or condiments included in the bag It's very frustrating when you get home to discover your order is not correct and you do not want to back out to get the rest of your order. Learn to get your orders right.  There are other places to purchase fried chicken in Brunswick that are less expensive and are bigger pieces of chicken!  Don't give people a reason NOT to go to your establishment"}
{"text":"Customer service is definitely lacking at this location. It seemed like none of the employees wanted to be there. 
A customer even said on his way out, \"don't work too hard\" and an employee said \"oh don't worry! I won't!\"
They were out of a lot of menu items and really didn't feel bad about telling you there were no other options."}
{"text":"I can just imagine all the hardships that those fabled explorers Lewis & Clark had to endure as they explored the unchartered West of the USA from 1804 to 1806. Harsh weather conditions and long hunting expeditions in search of food.

In my quest for sustenance today I ventured out to the local KFC to bag some chicken. It was like watching a movie scene in slow motion as it took probably close to 10 minutes before I received my food. Yeah, we've come a long way since 1806 where they could only wish to even capture any food within 10 minutes. In addition, I guess since the outdoor air temperature is only 89 they didn't feel like it was worthy to turn on the air conditioning. There was no air flow with fans, it was stifling in the restaurant.

Now the food did taste great but there is plenty of room left to improve the customer service and ambience of this place."}
{"text":"It's probably been about a year or so since I've been here. I ordered the 3 piece combo with a large drink for $9.05. Pretty pricey for 3 pieces of chicken and two smallish sides and a drink. 

I'll let you in on a secret, I pull the fried stuff off of my chicken. And underneath all that fried stuff are juicy and tasty pieces of chicken. The cole slaw at all of the KFC's is the best. Nobody beats the Colonel on cole slaw. The biscuit was good, I usually throw it out 9 times out of ten because it's usually hard and rank tasting. So the Colonel has definitely stepped it up a few notches in the biscuit department. More mash potatoes instead of all that gravy people. I didn't come here just to eat gravy.

The place is clean and the employees seem to do a good job. Why only 3 stars. That constant drive up bell drove me nuts. I was trying to get some reading in and the bell keep ringing non-stop. It kinda reminded me of the ACDC tune Hell's Bells in the beginning of the song. Imagine this bell sound every 15 seconds while you're in the dinning room.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G1RqPUvW8Y"}
{"text":"Whoever's managing this location shouldn't be. How could a once great national family dining chain turn into this?

I arrived about 6:30 PM. Out of original recipe, out of biscuits!?!?!  The dining area was absolutely filthy. Table was sticky looked and felt like it hadn't been cleaned for days.  Trash and chicken bones on the floor.  I couldn't stand the thought of seeing the restroom.

There's just no way this location could pass a heath inspection based on what I saw."}
{"text":"Stood in front of the line for 25 minutes.   No one acknowledged me so I left.  Several others behind me left also.  Terrible service!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Last night was the second time I have come to this place and they have no original recipe chicken. Really?? A Kentucky Fried Chicken with no chicken!? They tried to push the crispy chicken on me but I said no. They said I would have to wait then. I left."}
{"text":"Literally the worst KFC in existence. Order is never correct, staff are clearly the bottom of the barrel and management...wait, this place has management? Not likely. 

Last night, they were out of CHICKEN. Chicken, seriously. At a chicken place. 

I don't expect that much out of fast food, but can I at least get some kind of service?"}
{"text":"I was on my way to get my eyebrows done; however, I needed to put something on my stomach.  

I haven't eaten here in years but now I know why.  I can't stand when there's a lot of fat on the chicken.  Almost as if it's not cleaned.

For the most part the staff was nice."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband and daughter after years of not going to any KFC. Not only was this place dirty, the customer service was poor. When we walked in, there were 4 people already eating, 2 people were waiting, and there was no line inside or at the drive thru. It took maybe 5 minutes before we even got acknowledged. Then it took another 15 minutes before getting our order of a big box, famous bowl, and go cup; normally this wouldn't be an issue if we weren't the only ones waiting, and there weren't 5-6 employees mostly standing around doing nothing. The food definitely wasn't fresh either! There were no napkins or potato wedges. I realized I did not receive a cookie for the famous bowl, so I went to the counter. Multiple employees saw me, and no one bothered to say a word. One employee even walked up to the register to grab a cup and fill it up, but didn't bother to ask if I needed something. I never received the cookie and just left. The men's restroom had no paper towels or soap, yet more than half the employees were male (wonder if they even washed their hands properly throughout the day). NEVER coming back!!"}
{"text":"I love KFC. Let me get that straight. This particular establishment has 2 guarantees :

1.) You are going to wait A LONG TIME  in line, especially the drive thru.
2.) The chicken itself is usually over cooked or way too greasy here.

I've had some experiences here where it's really good and some where I wish I would have gone somewhere else. I do have to say the employees I've experienced there were all usually pretty friendly. They just need some work, especially with the slow paced drive thru."}
{"text":"Exactly what you would expect. Hit the spot but makes you feel nasty afterwords. Oh and I guess at this location it is bring your own silverware. I did not receive a fork so I had to use the lid of the container to eat my mash potatoes and cole slaw. Made me feel third world for a few. Next time I visit this location I will bring a fork:)"}
{"text":"Well I paid for a 16 piece of chicken I come home and I only have 10 in the bucket. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Lobby closes at 10pm, and the drive thru closes at 11pm. Arrived at 9:40pm, doors were locked. Tried to walk through the drive thru and they didn't even say that they didn't do walk ups, we gave up on that on our own. Tried politely knocking on the door (in that friendly rap so as not to scare the workers inside), the workers inside /deliberately/ ignored us. They were not open during their stated business hours, AND refused to acknowledge us."}
{"text":"Why don't we have the option for ZERO stars??!!!!??  Your menu consists of CHICKEN how are you ALWAYS OUT of it or expecting me to wait forever!! Then the girl taking our order seemed to have no idea of what she had! Never again will I come here!"}
{"text":"the KFC on el camino del norte (mlk) and craig has the worse food ever. don't even bother to go"}
{"text":"The service here wasn't bad until I pulled up in the drive thru window and they advised me after I ALREADY paid that they don't have biscuits and I said I'll wait and they then proceeded to tell me it was going to be five more additional minutes after ordering and asked me to pull my car up because they have a timer on there window...the timer is to show how efficient they are taking care of customers and asking a customer to pull up so corporate doesn't see that they are going way over there time limit is unbelievable...as well as the rude eye roll I got from the manager himself. I will not be moving my car up at all to save there butts from getting in trouble and I better not find my food messed with. No wonder we don't raise the minimum wage for fast food the service is ridiculous."}
{"text":"What else negative can I say about this location? Whatever you don't come to this KFC! The chicken here is HORRENDOUS and that's being nice. It's oily and it has a weird taste to it. You won't get much meat either. So onto the Mac and cheese. Wow! Very soupy and it has a funny taste as well. My guess is they can make it go longer by making it soupy. This location needs all new people here for sure. Colonel Sanders is rolling over in his grave right now. This location is CRAP!!! How dare they ask me to give it 1 star!"}
{"text":"Just paid $22.72 for an 8 pc. meal and got home without mashed potatos. Really? Even on the rexeipt it just says large gravy & large coleslaw. Who gets gravy without potatos? Tried to call, phone number has a voicemail that is not set up. Seriously? I live across town. Not every KFC has grilled chicken. So much for a splurge for dinner. KFC FAIL."}
{"text":"Omg Thomas is the best so friendly and very patient he even brought out food to us !!! He's a keeper !!!!!"}
{"text":"I cannot wait for Popeyes to open. Chicken taste like they need to change their oil. Still hungry because it was not even edible. Potato wedges were cold and they forgot my extra order of biscuits. Of course the thing they forgot was the only edible piece of food. I understand it's just fast food but it should be edible at the very least."}
{"text":"I wish I could give negative stars. This location apparently doesn't make chicken at all, because when you drive up, regardless of what part of the chicken you ask for, they don't have anymore. I'm like \"so what do you mean, you're out of chicken period? You don't make more?\" Sometimes they don't even have raw chicken to make chicken with. They keep a couple of soggy original recipe thighs to try and push off on you when they have nothing else you want. Save yourself the frustration and go down the block to Fry's and get good quality, edible chicken. Last night I stopped there to let my 4 year old use the potty and they turned my four year old away, talking about she had to buy something and have proof of purchase to use their disgusting bathroom. I understand keeping their bathrooms for paying customers but you don't even ever have any chicken and who turns away a little kid and tells them they have to have proof they bought something? I hoped they close down."}
{"text":"Went there to get a family meal, service was quick and the cashier seem like grouchy. We got home was ready to eat then there was NO BISCUITS at all!! Meal came with 6 biscuits. Its like dude you got One Job, 1 damn Job!! Ugh This wasn't the first time that it happened."}
{"text":"I had a craving for KFC. I went through the drive through and the machine was muffled terribly. The service was slow. When I got home, the food was poor quality. The mashed potatoes were dry and the macaroni and cheese was lumpy. Even the coleslaw was very dry. The worst was the chicken strips, which were extremely dry and nearly too hard to bite into. 

I returned to the location to comment the next day and the man at the counter (I assume the manager) was very rude.

I would not recommend this location based on service and good quality."}
{"text":"went to the drive thru and placed order .. Isaac ( manager )did not even ask if original or crispy .. I had to tell him once he told me to proceed to the window ... Once there i paid ,got food and NO receipt .. i waited until i got his attention and asked for it , since i was not going to drive away with out it . He gave to me and told him that since he didn't give me receipt . i remembered that they gave a discount or free meal for the future .. and was told only if i had driven away ...  got to my office called to speak to manager .. he answered . told him who i was and that i needed to speak to another manager on duty .. after a few minutes he tells me, manager with a customer that he would call me back ... didnt even ask for my number!!!! 2+ hours later and bo call ( i thought maybe caller id but seems like a no )Not the first time I have an issue at this location .. My food has been messed up in the past .. but when a manager talks to you with a tone .. thats more than enough not to come back"}
{"text":"Stood in line and waited for someone to walk up to the counter.  Nope,  a couple of workers just looked at me  like they didnt know what to do.  FINALLY, someone came up and took my order, (sounding like she didnt want to be there)  only to be told that they had run out of chicken.. UM.. HUH!?!?!  Isnt that what your \"restaurant\" is all about?!?!?   How do you run out of chicken.  Ridiculous place, no customer service, but they dont care about that.  Left with nothing."}
{"text":"Convenient location- right off the freeway, service was nice but the manager was not. Very condescending and rude.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Always a 10 min wait for the chicken tenders.  They make you exit the drive thru and wait in the parking lot.  I don't understand why there is never any chicken ready and they call themselves \"fast food\""}

{"text":"Just left this location approx 15 mins ago at 8:45 pm. I was told they only had 4 breasts and 5 wings left. I assumed they closed soon. According to the employee they closed at 10 pm. Another employee walked up and I asked him about ordering a family meal and her simply said they weren't making anymore chicken for the night. I told him \"but you close in an hour and 15 mins\" he said \"well yeah, but were already cleaned\" how is this the customers problem?  Do they really expect customers to just buy whatever they have left? I asked him for a corporate number. He said he didn't have it. I told him to ask the person In charge. He yelled out \"hey Allie\" Allie never came out of the office. He went inn their and said there was a customer bitc*ing. I advised him I would googling the number to complain. Corporate might also want to review the cameras. They have an employee waking around in flip flops mopping the lobby. And the back of the  Restaurant is all full of water and grease. Talk about a safety hazard. I will definitely share this with friends and family. I do not recommend this kfc to anyone. Unless you wanna be told what to eat."}
{"text":"Only reason why I grab something from KFC was for their new Nashville Hot chicken. Something new and wanted to try it. When I arrived, I planned to go through the drive through. However it was about eight deep. So I went ahead and parked so I could go inside. But I was about the fifth in line. There was only one person servings walk ins. You can imagine how long this took. There was about five workers there. One to service drive through, one servicing walk ins, and three to cook and bag the food. Sounds simple right! The manager should have help direct and help with the food. Instead she was the one serving walk ins.
Now when I finally got my food. The new Nashville Hot Chicken was actually pretty good. The biscuit was good, but the coleslaw was that good? Did they change it? Hardly eat at KFC anymore, so it doesn't taste the same as in the past. 
Here's my deal with fast food. Is these an easy job? Not really, thats why no one wants this job. However I don't want to hear that they deserve $15.00 an hour. Hell, most managers don't deserve that. This place is way to slow. Workers need to show some effort, and manager needs some training."}
{"text":"Now let me tell you something! I love my chicken! I am still looking for that great place to buy my fried chicken at in the Phoenix area! I will once in a blue moon stop off at KFC! Not my preferred fast food chicken to eat at!! But sometimes it's all I can find. I went ahead and ordered their two piece crispy chicken meal. Now you really can't add anything about fast foods! If you have eaten at one location pretty much they all taste the same! Service was OK, seem like they were in no hurry! Again, when you decided to eat at a fast food chain! You have to expect some kinds of issues! So, would I come back? Yes, only if I can't find a Popeyes Chicken around! I have no idea how this place stays open? I never see anyone here??"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 meals and a large popcorn chicken at the drive thru today. Checked the bag as my husband was driving and they forgot one of our sides and all of our sauces :( I thought maybe she just forgot to enter one of them as a meal, so I checked the receipt but we were charged for them. Also, as I was looking at the receipt I noticed that the bottom half of it was ripped off. The part where they give you a code to fill out a review of the service in exchange for a free go cup. Kinda sketchy but it could have just been an honest mistake. 

Since we were stopped at the red light we just made a U-turn and came inside to ask for our missing food. The dude up front just handed it to us without a word--no apology or anything for that matter lol.

And I'm pretty sure they gave us a smaller size popcorn chicken than we paid for, but it's a fast food restaurant so I won't give too harsh of a rating.. :P"}
{"text":"i've just had the worst kfc meal i've ever had!
The chicken was greasy and the sides half full and
the biscuits under cooked!  Oh and no napkins.
everything else was fine

{"text":"Just got $60 worth of food for dinner tonight. Cashier was really nice and friendly.  Order came out right.   Food was ok.  However, the gravy was too thin in consistency and was tasteless.   Since we had 2 large gravy worth almost $10, it was such a disappointment because we dip everything in gravy!  It won't even stick to the chicken or the fries."}
{"text":"I am pregnant and have been craving chicken legs. They have a 5 for 5 deal going right now with legs and thighs and I asked if I could get JUST the legs and he said yes. When I left and got back to work most of what I got were thighs which I am not fond of and the chicken itself was the worst I've ever had anywhere. I was waiting in the drive thru for a long time for chicken I won't even eat and they have a service charge for using a card which is icing on the cake."}
{"text":"Its your basic fast food fried chicken it was quick and easy. I got the 4# popcorn chicken with potato wedges..it was all hot tasted fresh and the service I received was more then acceptable..its not a place I find myself eating lunch but today for a quick stop it was above expectations. I'd go again"}
{"text":"This might be one of the worst KFC locations in all of the Phoenix area. Tables are absolutely filthy. Floor is disgusting. The \"employees\" walk around aimlessly and with seemingly no direction while customers wait 15+ minutes for simple orders. Basic menu items (biscuits, condiments, etc.) are simply not available. All Phoenix KFCs need to be shut down. Two of the Thomas locations (7th Ave and this one) are some of the worst offenders."}
{"text":"This is the worst damn KFC I've ever seen. First, when you walk in and approach the counter, it takes 5-6 minutes just to be acknowledged by one of the many staff you can see roaming in the background of the kitchen. 

On a recent visit, I asked another customer how long he had been waiting after getting his order taken at the counter. He said 25 minutes, so I wound up just leaving after 10 minutes or so, even though I'd bought a $5 combo. I just didn't want to waste my time arguing with some uncouth ghetto KFC employee about getting the $5 refunded."}
{"text":"Got a Zinger sandwich combo, and it turned out to be the worst fast food experience I had in a long, long time.  
The sandwich bun was dried out, and the bottom of the bun was so dry it could have been used as a hockey puck. 
Although I was the only customer at the drive-thru, they had me pull over into a parking space to wait for my food.  The food was ready in just about 3 minutes.  No idea why they would have someone pull over to wait in a space for such a short wait and with no one else in the drive thru lane.  
This KFC is the closest one to my residence, but I won't be back for a very long time, if ever."}
{"text":"This KFC serves mediocre food at best... I mean I know its KFC, but I've been to far better locations than this one. What's up with the prices? $10 for a 3 piece meal... No Thanks!"}
{"text":"Family friend ordered chicken today for lunch. I honestly think that they might have given us reheated or refried chicken from the night before. The taste really felt like it. Also one of the drumsticks I had was so dried up and blackened that you could see the bone at the leg holding area. I've seen all those weird facebook videos etc. And now I can say it maybe true..."}
{"text":"This is a Kentucky Fried Chicken and A&W root beer combo store. I have had the popcorn chicken here a few times and it was OK. The KFC prices for the boxes and buckets of chicken are just too high. When I have the whole family at home (6 adults and 3 children) I usually end up going across the street to Albertsons where an 8 piece fried chicken is just $4.99 most of the time (yep, $15 for 24 pieces). KFC and Church's need to pay attention since they think their competition is each other, when in fact it is the fried chicken at local grocery stores.
I have not noticed any lack of cleanliness noted by other reviewers (maybe it was just the luck of the draw on who was working at that particular time) and I have never seen seedy people there--just families with small children.
The parking is easy. You can only turn right out of the parking lot (west on Baseline or north on Dobson), so getting in and out of the parking lot can be a little tricky."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible HORRIBLE service. Asked for a combo but instead of potatoes, to have the Mac n cheese. She tells me that I have to have the potatoes and pay extra for Mac n cheese. 

I don't have to do anything except go down the street to Rasing Canes!"}
{"text":"Slow service and rude. They let you sit in the drive through for almost 4 minutes before taking your order. Then when you ask for mac n cheese instead of mashed potatoes, they won't. Never again."}
{"text":"Worst kfc ever to exist. Slow, cold and old!!! 

Slow service.
Cold food 
Old Rancid Oil. 

Plus they wouldn't let me substitute mashed potatoes for anything else. 

Go to Canes or Chick-fil-a for the extra buck or two."}

{"text":"Always an adventure when I come here. Drive thru is so bad every time. Decided today was my last time. It's not that I think they don't care, I just think they do not hire the best workers. Wish they did because the KFC is addictive and I think put an addictive chemical in it to make crave for it nightly."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for dinner food has changed drastically. The chicken fingers were warm, green beans have changed. Mashed potatoes were gross.. The biscuit was not like I remember either. The only thing that tasted like it should was my pepsi. cookie was ok aside from that food was really gross. Will not be returning to any kfc's anymore!! This food chain has changed its recipe for sure. Boo

Canned green beans Blah!!

Mashed potatoes tasted like hey were made with tap water and lemon head juice if that makes any sense strange? I know but that's the best way I know how to describe it completely gross"}
{"text":"Iv been to this KFC 3 times in the last year. Each time I went I had the worst kfc experience iv ever had in my entire life. I was going to write out the whole story but they've already wasted too much of my time so I'll keep it as short as possible. The fact that the only 3 times Iv been there were the worst is an anomaly but not a coincidence. They don't like their jobs and they don't care. The 3rd and last time I went me and a person before me were standing at the register for 10 minutes before someone came to even take our order. I just walked out and left because that's how it is every time and then you wait 20 to 30 minutes and your food looks like they stabbed your chicken with the tongs a couple of times or whatever they used to pick it up. Didn't fill my cup thing up with the corn it was outstandingly disrespectful. I can see the drive thru getting served while I'm there but I have a work truck so I have to go inside. The lady working at the drive thru always looks mad then waits 10 minutes before she makes someone from the back come and take our order and when they come they look like they hate us for making them have to work. It's not right."}
{"text":"So I used a credit card and didn't get a receipt... then my girlfriend asked the cashier if she can have buffalo sauce with the order and she said she didn't have any....but then soon enough another customer asked for hot sauce. My whole thing is the cashier could of suggested hot sauce instead of saying we don't have any. The hot sauce would of been the next best thing so customer service is out the window. Their dinning room is a mess all tables are dirty and all trash cans are filled to the brim. No napkins and a stupid alarm went off the whole time I was there because they had the back door open."}
{"text":"Went through the drive-thru on a Tuesday evening. I ordered 3 $5 fill-ups and 2 individual sides of corn. They were not very busy at all.  I ordered and my order was repeated to me. I get to the window and sat for 15-20 minutes before the girl opened the window, I was very close to just driving away but I was so tired after a long day at work and my kids were hungry. I'm used to going through a drive-thru and someone taking my money before my order is bagged and ready. I gave her my money, $20.01 for a $19.01 order to be exact, and she gave me my $1 change. I figured she put the receipt in one of the two bags she was handing me. She then gave me our 3 drinks in a drink carrier. I then have the chance to ask her for butter and honey, my daughter was with me and she reminded me since I almost forgot, due to her taking so long. 

I get home and my kids are taking the food out of the bags. 1.) They forgot straws 2) No napkins 3) No corn, my kids were both very disappointed 4) No butter, only honey 5) No receipt. So I went to look up the number here on yelp and was not shocked at all to see 2 stars. 

I refuse to go back to that location. I've worked in the restaurant business and I have to say that it is not that hard of a job to put together an order that is on a screen. Not hard to be friendly and listen to requests. If you can't do the best at the job you chose to work, than you need to find a new job."}
{"text":"Bad service rude counter people long wait time and its dirty there gross tables floors and bathroom"}
{"text":"I can honestly say that I've been instrumental in assisting this particular restaurant in disposing of a few hundred delicious chickens and I've done so without a single regret! As Sarah R mentioned, they are consistent. As far as being slow? I haven't noticed this restaurant being slow at all except when they're packed. But that's to be expected. They may want to refine their queuing algorithm... 

I may be biased but I just LOVE KFC. In fact it's listed as my last meal in my profile. This may be one of the very few 5 star ratings I ever give. My hat's off to you Colonel... Even though you're not with us physically, you'll always be remembered in our hearts and our stomachs!"}
{"text":"Had an awesome experience at this location. Shannon handled the order and it was ready on time. She was friendly and made sure when we left that we were happy. I learned the key is going when the adults are working. Food was great and all 9 of us enjoyed our 4th of July dinner. Thanks Shannon!"}
{"text":"Management seriously needs to take care of business. The dining room is filthy and the cashier kept taking one order, then going to the back and helping for 5 minutes. She should be taking a few orders at a time, then going back to help. The drive thru cashier could have been helping instead of the dining room cashier if it was 100% necessary, but it didn't appear to be. There needs to be some severe retraining at this location ASAP. Square your stuff away KFC. Also, the cashier needs to not ask \"is that everything today?\" after every single item. Let the customer tell you when they are done."}
{"text":"The prices are higher than than other KFC restaurants. A three piece dark meat was 9.49. They wanted to charge me an extra 25 cents to get corn instead of slaw. I refused. She said ok and still gave me the meal.  The 5.00 box is 5.50...go figure why that is different. They seem to have a problem with keeping things clean. The girl put a bandage on her finger in front of me then came over to take my order. Not sure what to think of that. ? The drink station was out of lids for large drinks and out of the tropical fruit punch. It was only 11:38 am when I came in to order.  This is not the first time I came in and have not been happy, I think this is the last. They make up their own prices even though they say the regional manager makes the prices. He might be the crook."}
{"text":"This place sucks, it's the only KFC that I've ever been to that is out of chicken consistently - and this is at 8pm, not right before close. I have experienced incorrect orders through drive through at least 50% of the time. The guy that usually works the drive through is rude, been there forever, and won't give you napkins or sauces unless you ask. Take the drive to another location this place is tanking."}
{"text":"disgusting ice from the machine is always crushed into smalls, my popcorn shrimps were hard and old.. don't go"}
{"text":"Worst KFC I've ever had. I ordered a 3pc grilled box. 1 breast, 1 thigh, and a 2 bite tiny wing. Seemed like a 2 PC meal since the only piece that was a normal size was the breast. But that wasn't the worst part.  They were so dry my cat wouldn't eat it. Very disappointed since KFC is a treat for me. I got it to go and didn't discover how bad it was until I got home. Otherwise I would've taken it back."}
{"text":"Had an issue with my order and the phone number on the receipt is not directly linked to the store.  Therefore, I still have an unresolved issue and no one answers the phone number on the receipt.  I placed an order and when I got home it was not what I ordered."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money here!  Go to Popeyes or any place but here.
I  placed my order inside of the restaurant rather than drive thru because you usually receive the worst food when you go through the drive thru.  
I checked my order before I left and discovered they had given me old potato wedges. I told the manager that this was unacceptable so he trashed those and gave me some fresh ones.  What if I didn't check?
Also, I placed an order for 8 pieces of chicken.  When I got home it was 7 pieces.  I guarantee the manager knew he had given me 7 pieces.
He watches those employees like a hawk so I know for sure he doesn't miss a beat.  
 They keep their napkins and condiments behind the counter. 
I haven't seen such pettiness!
Clearly you shouldn't be in business.  Next!!!!!........"}
{"text":"This is always been the worst KFC in Las Vegas however it is the closest long John silver's so I would stop here anyway found out yesterday they don't do long John silvers through the drive-through anymore? What?
 I have to actually go in The worst KFC just became the worst Long John Silver's! Will never go back to this place again"}
{"text":"I've been to this location two times and will NEVER go again.  I was there before the dinner rush so service should have been quick, yet I had to wait 10-minutes just to place my order.  There was no effort by the counter help to fill my order.  In fact, after waiting another 20 minutes, the crew person informed me that they were out of the items I ordered and would have to wait at least another 10-minutes for them to cook up a new batch.  I thought this was fast food!  

The manager was clueless, and clearly had no handle on inventory and ensuring they always had all types of chicken available (and to think I was there just before the dinner rush).  The manager also seemed to make no effort to ensure the entire crew was up to speed on providing customer service and doing all aspects of their job. 

The manager issued a cash refund (she didn't know how to refund the original credit card transaction) and tried to \"fix\" things by offering me a free 3-piece chicken tender meal which I took, but I did not wait around for my order."}
{"text":"Yes, this is a KFC, so I won't bother reviewing the food. Besides, it's not the food here that's bad... it's the service! Staffed by hostile and indifferent teenagers, the missus and I stopped going to this KFC for a long time, as staff were surly and our orders were almost always incorrect. Nowadays we only tend to go there for the occasional single item (a small cole slaw or Snacker), as we don't think they'll get it right.

I think the management of this location needs to impart on their staff that many folks come to KFC to get meals for their entire families. I wouldn't complain so much if Taco Bell messed up a 99¢ burrito... but if I'm paying KFC $20 for a family meal and they forget the biscuits or give us the wrong sides, or give us Extra Crispy when we ordered Original I'm going to be ANGRY!

They also need to understand that, at their prices, no one's going to put up with this. I can get far better chicken at Price's for nearly the same money... so why go to KFC?"}
{"text":"Worst customer service I work in a restaurant and when I came here he wouldn't talk the guy at the counter just nodded and then left when I went back to ask for forks they all were on the phone and would not answer me do not come to this kfc"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Lived in this area for 20 yrs. Been in this place a couple of time and every time been disappointed. Filthy inside. 
This time I needed a quick side to my meal at home. So decided to stop and get 2 large sides of Mashed Potatoes and gravy. ($7.98) on my way home. When at home and as I open the containers, I come to find some yellow, dried up looking substance that seem to be the mashed potatoes I had been sold. They smelled a bit burnt even. God knows how long those potatoes had been sitting in a heating drawer? 
This place is a disgrace!!! KFC should not allow this franchise to have its name. 
Wish I could do ZERO STARS!!! Through the years have never had a even decent experience here. Either from not having enough pieces of original recipe chicken to complete my order. To seriously long waits at the register."}
{"text":"I went to here at noon yesterday,pretty slow that time.two customers in front of me.but I waited for twenty minutes have not got my food, 30 mins later finally got my food. The food is very salty.looks not fresh,they also missed my two side orders.I will never go there again to waste my time."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. After waiting in the drive thru for over 15 minutes with only one car ahead of me I assumed they must have been making something fresh. Boy was I wrong!! The chicken was soggy and slimy. I couldn't eat it. So I went to continue on to my mac n cheese and mashed potatoes... No utensils! I got 15 napkins, 9 packets of hot sauce and 11 packets of honey sauce (actual count) but no utensils! Just go ahead and close this location already!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service ! They always get my order wrong and the employees are rude. I recommend not visiting this location get some pollo loco from down the street."}
{"text":"This was an unexpected trip 
All I knew was I didn't want to cook dinner and we needed something that would be easy for my wife to eat since she had just spent the day at the dentist and her mouth was sore.
Serenity was our server she took our order and helped us figure out what we wanted because we were so indecisive I wanted all thighs but my mother in law and wife likes legs I like crispy they like original see what I'm getting at? Lol 
it was hot and I wasn't in anyway ready to order and serenity was super patient, which means a lot to me lol 
She gave us a cup for something to drink while we waited which really helped cool me off. We didn't even have to wait long either. 
When she gave us our bags she repeated everything we ordered even included sauces and honey with out us asking ... round of applause for that and because she felt the pieces of chicken were small she gave us a few extra pieces of thighs. 
Excellent service! This place is changed from that 1.5 star rating , I'd say give them another chance lol and keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I really need to stop coming back.

Every single time, and I mean every single time I go to KFC they manage to get my order completely wrong. It's so frustrating the lack of customer service and quality insurance. I really wish my nephew did not like this place.

I have spoken to managers on  several occasions when my order has been incorrect. Obviously, it really doesn't help because I can be assured on the following visit something will be missing, wrong, or just taste bad.

I really wish zero Stars was an option."}
{"text":"This location is a decent one. They did forget two items from our order, however, and we called and talked to the manager. He invited us to order again the next night, which we did, and he made sure we got the two original items we didn't get the night before (fresh and free) and also threw in a free dessert for us. He was very friendly and apologized numerous times for the forgotten items the night before. 

I've never gotten any bad food from this location, but I've been to better locations."}
{"text":"Nice fast place to get your food. Helpful employees and the chicken is good. Depending on the time of day you go, but most times you are in and out of there"}
{"text":"I really need to stop coming back.

Every single time, and I mean every single time I visit any KFC they manage to get my order completely wrong. It's so frustrating the lack of customer service and quality insurance. 

This visit was no different. In addition, to poor service and the incorrect order the restaurant didn't have a clean table. 

I really wish zero Stars was an option."}
{"text":"This restaurant leaves a lot to be desired when they only have one cashier jumping between the counter and the drive throw. Not a positive experience. To bad because I like KFC but this restaurants needs major help."}
{"text":"They were not rude to me as I completed my order, but in the 10 minutes I was there the lady doing drive through was arguing with a customer in the store, literally yelled at another through the mic \"I can't hear you!\" then proceeded to talk bad about there customers in front of the 8 customers in the store. I will not be back here the crew seems toxic wonder how they'd act if a GM was here. Food and beverage is what I would expect as far as that is concerned.
So an update they got new staff and same management. They have gotten much better and it seems the managers have them working hard. Customer service has been night and day different glad to see people striving to be better!"}
{"text":"How is this place still open with only two stars... My journey began when I ordered my food and had to repeat it back a few times because the box was not working properly or the person taking the order was barely listening. Normally, I do not mind repeating my order because honestly we all have our bad days or machines don't work, its life.

As I pull up to the window he repeats back my order, which seems to be correct. Then, open up my bag to check the food and BOOM it was wrong. I decided to go inside, and as I approach the cashier I hear a KFC team member screaming \"oh somebody got another order wrong\" hint: they were talking about someone waiting at the drive-thru. 

At this point it has become hilarious and sad because they screwed up my food, the guy waiting in line behind me, and another person's food in the drive-thru.

Needless to say, the food was cold and the service was horrible, please close this place down."}
{"text":"We have tried this location about six times since they've opened.  

The order is never correct.  Most times, when pointed out, they correct it.  Sometimes they don't.  The last time we went, I was basically told \"too bad\" when I pointed out the order was incorrect.  We threw half the food away (none of us would eat what we did not order), and the other half was overdone, salty and rancid.  I would suggest staying far away from this location, as it is poorly managed and the staff do not care whether the customer is served correctly."}
{"text":"Bad service and bad food!  Been going here about once/month for the past 2-3 years - both service and food used to be pretty good.  But it's really gone downhill over the past year - take out orders often missing items and chicken is dry.  Won't go back anymore - next time I want fried chicken I will try Popeye's!  KFC home office really should investigate this place!"}
{"text":"So. If you go to a chicken place 3 hours before they close, you would think that they would have chicken to sell. Your name literally has chicken in it. What I don't understand is how they can say sorry we only have 9 pieces of chicken and won't be making anymore tonight. How does this make sense? You sell chicken and have 3 more hours before you close. I was a high level manager within yum corp, and you better believe I will be contacting your area manager to let them know. How annoying, lazy workers, bad work ethic. I get it's fast food but if you don't like your job, or want to do it, get a new one."}
{"text":"First of all, they could not seem to comprehend what my 3 piece order was.......it took forever for them to complete the order and then I open it up to see that my 3 piece order only has 2 pieces.  I have to say, the chicken was so greasy......not like what I used to remember it to be.  The worst part was that as I was eating the chicken, a scary looking homeless vagrant came in and started going around to everyone to ask them to buy her a dinner......and it was not like the staff was ushering her out of the restaurant.  I doubt that I will go back to this location......."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but 15 minutes for food through the drive thru after ordering is too slow. I didn't get a receipt, and when they FINALLY brought our food, there was no thanking me for my patience, no apology, just shoving the bag In the window \"Here's your chicken.\"  Sorry I was such an inconvenience for ordering something from the menu."}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood KFC I usually don't eat fast food but as I am 9 months into my pregnancy I decided to live on the edge. I went in the drive thru to order what I thought was pretty self explanatory, just to find out the employee that was taking my order was completely unknowledgeable with the menu. On top of that, her English wasn't the best and it was hard to communicate anything I ordered. The employee even put me on hold to consult with another associate. There was no way to insure my order was correct from a scream like most places so I had to hold faith that my order was correct. When pulling up to the window I'm holding my breath as my 8 year old notices my frustration and states that the order is clearly going to be wrong. In spit of all that I paid for my order and was not given the option to see a receipt to verify what was paid for or the cost associated. I was also never given the option for sauce or condiment. My food was rather slapped together with less than normal portions as well. Rather than vent to a manager I thought others should know what there up against when going to this KFC I would give them no stars If I could, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"It's a KFC. It does whatever any other KFC can do. All I can say about this one is be careful going here on a Friday night because people are buying food for their families and sometimes the line gets long and it might be a 20 minute wait to get your  bucket of chicken."}
{"text":"They need to close this place down horrible service and idiots that  work the counter and an old lady running and bagging the food! FML!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service at this location went in for a family meal, the girl who attended me didn't know how to smile I felt like I was bothering her, after all it was my money I was spending, they had run out of biscuits when I decided to stay after asking another employee how long it would take she made an effort to yell across the room, as she was helping other customers, that I would be waiting for a while, excuse me, but again my time my money. When I get home my biscuits were not thoroughly cooked WHAT A JOKE! I've gone to this location on a hand full of occasion's i have always felt they needed some brushing up on their customer service skills and have given them the benefit of the doubt but today was by far the WORST NEVER PLAN ON GOING THERE EVER, I'll stick to Fry's deli chicken"}
{"text":"I have read the reviews and Ihave to say everyone is usually very sweet, with the exception of Sonya the manager. Wow, what a grouch. She is gruff, and very rude. She made me fell like she was doing me a favor by handing my food to me. Wow, I wa shocked how rude she was when I asked for some salt and peeper packets. She didn't have a name tag, and when a very nice young man came to hand me the salt and pepper, I asked him if she was the manager and what her name was. He was very polite, and kind. he had taken my order, and my money, but all of a sudden she was shoving the bag out at me. I suggest the get rid of her, and promote someone else to the position. I believe she is the reason everyone else working there seems so down. She is a very nasty unhappy women!!
I would have given it no stars, but in the past I have had some wonderful service.
Whom ever owns this franchise might want to look into this matter."}
{"text":"Have a craving for fried chicken at 9:30? KFC is one of the few choices, especially in this area. Note that the counter closes at 9pm. Only the drive through is open till 10. So I don't know if they addressed my previous complaint about condiments and utensils being behind the counter because we showed up at 9:30.. We only got the extra crispy this time, so I cannot comment on the \"regular\". It was good. Not too greasy, crisp, not burned.  A lot of times \"crispy\" usually tastes partially burned, but not here.

I was glad we made this stop.  Perhaps a tad pricey for what it is, but the chicken was good and satisfied the craving."}
{"text":"Stopped here to get my 82 year old father a meal on my way to visit him and asked for butter and honey. No butter no honey no napkins. Seriously?"}
{"text":"This was our worst experience with a KFC yet!   3 workers sitting in booths on their phones.  Door locked even though it was 8:25pm & Lobby was suppose to be open until 9.   We should have left.  Waited 20 minutes for a soggy bucket of sad looking chicken & the wrong sides!   Actually they don't deserve a 1 star!   Don't go there!!!!!  We have gone there before and had good meals but it has been a while & I think we are done with this location!"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of bad reviews but I've never had a problem here.

Every time I'm in Sun City I stop here as Taco Bell and KFC's coleslaw are my grandpa's favorite foods.  They've always gotten my order right and have never been out of anything (mind you I've never ordered chicken which is what got a lot of negative reviews). 

Also, I went here for my grandpa and ordered him a senior drink, which is free at this location, and they didn't hassle me about not being a senior myself."}
{"text":"I've had trouble here but they've made it right, and it's in the past.. This is one of the nicest KFCs I've seen in a long while, and usually really spotless.

Try the 9pc family meal it's one of their specials right now.   I've had the Famous Bowl combo before, it's cheaper to buy the combo than buying just the bowl.

Tonight I came in because I signed up for the emailing list on KFC.com & for joining I received a coupon for 10 pc bites combo.  The manager was friendly and despite I was missing a bite it was still very delicious. I'm sure they'll get it right the next time, no problem (I blame myself for not checking the bag). The bites were juicy and hot.

The only thing that would of made my visit better if they had asked me what I wanted for dipping sauce, she punched in Creamy Ranch on the receipt but never asked what I wanted to dip in.  She was nice, smiled and was polite. Other than the missing bite & not asking me what I wanted for sauce it was still a better visit than in the past. For that I am not taking a star away like most yelpers that take points away for something small. Thank you.  I'll be back the next time I'm craving KFC."}
{"text":"I see why this joint has so many bad ratings. Their customer service is terrible. I mean, come on! If you hate your job then quit and find something you enjoy! The drive-thru employee sounded very rude and uninterested over the intercom. Just \"ok\" and \"your total\". I felt like I was the one working and making sure he was taking my order."}
{"text":"I usually stay satisfied with this place maybe it's from the chemical inserted chicken that makes me feel satisfied. So it's with great despair that I can't give them a good review my chicken pot pie was only have full of pot pie. Are they trying to stretch it out or what very lame unsatisfied lady here."}
{"text":"After all the lines and anticipation that the opening created, I decided to wait until things calmed down to revisit KFC. I should have not waited. I should have not even wasted my money going there. First off, the order was wrong. I ordered the Nashville chicken tenders. Three thin, heavily breaded chicken tenders sitting in a puddle of grease with one pickle slice on it. My biscuit was saturated in that grease too. I didn't get my mashed potatoes & gravy that I ordered. The cold slaw was good, typical KFC coleslaw. My friend just kept saying that it was not near as good as it used to be. I gave it a try, but won't go back. It is definitely not the KFC I grew up with."}
{"text":"I had the worst delivery experience of my life! I was at my daughters new place helping her move in. This KFC is literally from google maps so 3 minute drive or 20 minute walk. We were tired and still doing stuff so we ordered food. Well after 5 phone calls and a 10 min direction conversation with the driver we received our food 2 hrs and 15 minutes later. YES 2 hrs and 15 minutes for a 3 minute drive. Couldn't get anywhere with the manager eventually offered me a 20% discount on ice cold fries and chicken, no accessories I had asked for. The drivers interac machine wasn't working, ended up getting a discount because he was lucky I had some cash, than I found from my bank I was charged. CRAZY!!! The one star should be \"0\"!!"}
{"text":"You should put the heat on because KFC (Kelly Feels Cold). Then again, she always does. Maybe she should see a doctor about it.

Usually I would give Kentucky Fried Chicken a 2 star rating because secretly if it's done right I actually like their chicken. I don't love it, mind you, and it's overpriced, it's greasy, and it's often old and congealed... but when it's actually fresh I like it. Especially their chicken burgers with a little zing.

The food here was horribly average KFC 2-star food, but then when I needed to plug my phone in because my car had broken down and was in a nearby garage, they told me that I could not use the outlet. This is not the part of town where random troublemakers will come in and use outlets and harass customers. It's in a perfectly nice suburb and there was no reason in the world not to let me use it. After all, I was a customer and why else is an outlet in the lobby. Therefore one star."}
{"text":"Drive thru is not the way to order here. Better off going to the one that is farther away on Durango. Third time in the last few weeks they have messed up my order. Ordered my meal and asked for extra crispy. She repeats order back which they should always do but says original. I correct her and say no can I please have extra crispy. She said okay and repeated my order back to me. I should have checked the order before I left because of the two previous times but as usual was just too tired. Not worth the hassle of driving back or calling it in to fix It. So if you go to this KFC I would recommend going inside. You are better off going to church's which is right down the street if you want to go drive thru. This Drive thru never gets it right. But on the flip side food is always hot and the biscuits are never hard."}
{"text":"Horrible place. Wouldn't come back. Didn't even order food since the lady didn't feel like taking our order. We were waiting to order our food for 25 minutes....so boyfriend and I left."}
{"text":"I got awesome service from Laquitia today at the drive thru....the best customer service  ive ever had at KFC, this girl deserves a RAISE!  Stellar service with a SMILE unheard of these days!! I will be back SOON!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been craving a KFC bowl for a while now and finally decided to order one. I will say I'm saddened to have left immediately disappointed. At the window the young woman asked what I wanted to drink again, for the second time I requested Pepsi! When I pulled off I took a sip and almost died from DIET SODA POISONING!! I'm self diagnosed with an intense diet anything allergy! So that was sad! Moving on to the bowl, the corn.. good, the potatoes.. good, gravy... a touch salty but good, the side of slaw was really good, but then the chicken chunks... super salty just too salty for human consumption. It was a travesty. Hopefully KFCs new VR training program will correct these seasoning issues! Depending on how desperate I get I may try again, but for now it's a no."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I always come here when we want fast food and it's always good. I like that's it's KFC and Taco Bell combined. Every time we come here it's always fresh and never had a problem with the staff. Actually I've noticed that the workers there are always nice and never have attitudes or anything. There's a Taco Bell closer to us and we always drive out to this one because the one closer is always cold and disgusting if you go past 7 (Poplar St/Greentree). All in all this KFC/Taco Bell is a really good put together store and not once have disappointed me."}
{"text":"Cashier Khaleeyah was left here with just some cooks and NO manager, I went thru the drive thru and my wife had to ASK TWICE at the menu for her drink the cashier kept getting it wrong finally we went to the window and just told her in person. Then I had to ask for my bottle of water to be handed to us when she went away from the window she returened with mustard and shut the window and told me to have a nice day we had to wait for her to return so we could again ask for my freakin WATER!!! Finally she grabs me my water we drive home and I open my box to eat my 10$ meal and instead of giving me the number 14 which they charged me for they gave me a 5.95$ meal so I go to call the store....... Ring.... Ring.... Ring... so I get back in my car drive back to talk to someone in person to just get my money back and I arrive to a empty lobby! So why the hell didn't they answer the phone. Anyway I enter the store and ask to just get my money back and do you think that was an easy process nope!!!! The Manager on duty isn't even in the building!!!!!! How can that be acceptable so I had to wait even longer for her to get back!!! They refuse to refund me for my wife's food that's sitting at home getting cold because she didn't bring hers so tomorrow I will be bringing back her meal. A DAY OLD and getting the rest of my money for the food! Just  ridiculous! So you have now lost me as a customer for life!!! This is the worst experience I've ever received please hear my warning do not go here!

{"text":"Consider this review a public service announcement.  I usually don't review fast food restaurants, but this one is a stand out.  And trust me, you should stand outside, far far away.  Don't even think about going in.

Having lived in the area for 3 years and married to a KFÇ cole slaw fanatic, we've had cause to come here a handful of times.  First time, not so good.  Second time, not so good.  Every time since, not so good.  

If we're lucky, the only problem is our order is screwed up.  Most likely it's screwed up and bad food.  Chicken strips are like shoe leather, potato wedges are chewy, tender roast should be called dry roast, and original recipe chicken must be mistaken for the original chicken.  All in all, it saddens me a chicken had to die for this.

So I walk away with two lessons learned.  One-this place NEVER gets any better, and two-my husband and I are not good with lessons."}
{"text":"Before you leave, check your order. My order was missing a couple of things. I bought a 16 piece family meal and my kids wanted a lot of mashed potatoes. It was missing one large mashed potato and ended up making one at home. I called that night and spoke to the manager. She apologized and said they will write my name down so when I come back they will give me one. When I came back a few days later, they wouldn't give me one without a receipt. So why even ask my name and write it down? Just double check all your order before going home."}
{"text":"Hands down the most incompetent workers ever I'm so surprised they let a KFC run like this. I ordered a three piece meal white meat.. Got all dark meat then they forgot my 2 sides then when I went back to get white meat the guy did but asked me how much he should up charge me??? Then when I got back to my seat it only 2 pieces of chicken... I was so over it I didn't even care I just wanted to leave. Not one worker know what is going on they where yelling and dropping things and as slow as could be .... Don't eat here"}
{"text":"The worst place I have ever been, wrong food for me and 4 people beside me in line. No hurry to fix it, no acknowledgement."}
{"text":"Every one in a while this type of junk  food is ok. The food may not be the best quality, however, the service from the staff was great. My order was not ready because they had no chicken made yet. They stepped up and quickly got my order ready, I realize this is a fast food place and they are supposed to work quickly. But I still liked how the team worked together to get me my meal it made me feel special. 

While it will be a long while before I am back here to order again I must say the service at this particular location will be what brings me back. Chicken!!"}
{"text":"Waited in the drive thru for 20 min,  with only two cars in front of us. Everything we asked for was not available. When we got past the ordering part, that first car was still waiting for their food. Car in front of us, and us both left because it was taking forever. We will never go back to this one. Horrible serivice."}
{"text":"Well, what had happened was I was going to buy the #5 fill up box and then pay the extra for a side of the Nashville hot sauce. 

But, for some reason the cashier told me, \"We don't do that.\"

WAIT!!!   o.O    WHAT!!!   o.O.   HUH?!?!?!

What fast food restaurant does not \"Do this.\"?...that is...sell sides of sauce.

I mean this is a fast food joint. It's not like my ordering a side of sauce is going to interfere with the unique floral bouquet of the deep fried little chicken tender thingy sandwiched between the sad, soggy and lonely pickle and smushed bun.

Maybe I missed something. Maybe KFC no longer offers sides if sauce anymore??? Or is the economy really that bad that I can't even PURCHASE a side of sauce from KFC???

Someone PLEASE school me if I am crazy and irrational in thinking I might be able to PURCHASE a side of hot sauce.......smh. You definitely lost out on a higher sale and another loyal customer Mr. Local KFC. 

p.s. not that it's related but, this reminds me of the time when a different fast food worker asked me why I wanted a couple packets of ketchup. My response?

\"Because I ordered FRENCH FRIES.\""}
{"text":"I came here to get an order of chicken tenders for dinner with the new Tennessee hot sauce. They wanted to charge $4.50 extra for this flavor of sauce. Come on, I'll admit, I worked at KFC as a teenager. All they do is add hot water to powder mix and dip chicken in sauce. $4.50 extra? Get real. I left and went to fry's where chicken strips are better and cheaper."}
{"text":"Ordered through the KFC app at 5:30. Got the delivery confirmation so I was sure everything was in the system. 
We got a call from them at 6:15 saying \"Do you still want your order delivered? It didn't print out.\" I was a bit frustrated so I asked how much longer it would take as my daughter was getting hungry. The employee said it would be another 20-30 minutes but with the weather it was probably more. I told them I was going to pick it up because of the wait. I asked if it would be ready and they said they just started preparing it. 
I was at the restaurant twenty minutes later and as it was a large order, I didn't expect it to be ready right away. It turns out they hadn't even started making the food until I got there, so I was waiting twenty minutes.
Also, we ordered extra crispy but some of the things we ordered were not extra crispy because it would take too long. At least we got a 20% discount. And about the order not printing out? The employee was holding a copy of our order.

The only thing that saved this review from being one star was the quality of the food. 

KFC, maybe keep better track of big orders (that give you more money) next time."}
{"text":"Always good fried chicken and comfort sides of mashed potatoes and mac and cheese"}
{"text":"Drive thru windows are filthy but the service is fast. The employees really aren't happy with life or their jobs. Didn't put napkins in the bag. No butter or honey either."}
{"text":"I went in at around 11:30am and there were no cars in the parking lot but 2 in the drive thru ahead of me, which should have been my sign.  I was told to please hold on and waited about 5 minutes before saying \"Hello?\" And immediately got \"sorry for the hold what can I get you?\", so was he just waiting?  I gave my order and was told they no longer do the grilled chicken, which the company website seems to disagree with.  I ordered a side of biscuits which only seems to come in pairs.  I looked through the drive thru window and the place was dead, no customers standing there so no idea why they were behind when the food is pretty much pre-prepped.  I got home and only got 1 biscuit and it was stale.  I go to this one because it is close by my house but I am honestly worried about the food quality from this location and will look for a different one..."}
{"text":"Food is good however not having been at a KFC in years, I was shocked at the micro sized chicken pieces and biscuit. Chicken breast was the size of a small thigh; wing was as if it came from a small bird. Biscuit was about 1.5\" in diameter."}
{"text":"Me: \"Hi, I need 3 of the #4 fill-em-ups, please. One one of them, I need NO GRAVY on the mashed potatoes. I also need a side of corn.\"

KFC: \"Ok, 3 of the #4 fill em ups, one with no gravy on the mashed potatoes?\"

Me: \"Correct.\"

KFC: \"And a side of corn?\"

Me: \"Yes, correct.\"

KFC: \"Please pull around, thank you.\"

25 minutes later I get home to eat the nastiest dried out chicken EVER, all 3 with gravy on the mashed potatoes, and no side of corn. I partly fault myself for not checking, but honestly, I'm not getting paid to check the meals like they are. Oh, and no receipt with the order. How convenient. Avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"Recently went back here because it was Customer Appreciation day and they had a great special I showed up about an hour before they closed there were no customers, but they seemed to have to check to see if they had the stuff that I ordered, per the other reviews I know they can only hold food for a certain amount of time before it goes bad, i think they are not ad-hearing to those guidelines, the grilled chicken I got was pretty dry, like it had been sitting a little to long. Overall the store was clean, the price was good and the service was descent. I would suggest maybe going during the afternoon when they are going thru product to guarantee the freshness of it. Let's just say I probably wont go here, unless I am craving it. It's edible but not much more."}
{"text":"Well just another screwed up order this evening. I ordered a two piece original, a breast and a wing with mashed potatoes and green beans. I get home, open the box and potatoes were nice and hot. Then I opened the Green Beans which were really \"Macaroni & Cheese\". So I really had to open a can of my own green beans and microwave them. So I went to get the chicken out and it was cold, so I had to microwave that. I checked my receipt and it did say green beans. I know this kind of thing happens at fast food places. But that KFC is always screwed up! From now on it will be \"POPEYES\" for me! I HAVE HAD FROM THAT KFC!"}
{"text":"Dinner should be easy when ordering a simple 3 piece meal. After waiting for 7 mins watching my food on a plate get cold/ I'm told that they have no coleslaw and then after choosing another item I'm told that that the second item is not available. So I asked for my money back but they said NO... Can't give it back, I'll have to come back for another meal and get free then., BULLSHIT  DO NOT GO BACK EVER,,, MANAGER SHOULD BE FIRED, AND FRONT STAFF  SHOULD BE FIRED.. NO CLASS NO RESPECT NO SERVICE"}
{"text":"The absolute worst experience and customer service. My boyfriend and I went to the drive- thru tonight, ordered 6 piece half grilled and half original requesting white meat (which is extra) along with a half cut sweet/ unsweetened tea. While we were placing our order, the cashier Rachael was singing \"the weekend\" by Sza (that's how clear the music was through the intercom). 

I tried to laugh it off, but my boyfriend hush at me to be quiet. When we got our order, my boyfriend grabbed the drink. I immediately noticed tea was all over the lid. I thought the girl may have over filled it but by the time i got home the tea was all in my cup holder. 

I got home to find all 6 piece original style chicken. I immediately called and Rachael picked up the phone. After we spoke the phone goes silent, I had to just assume I was on hold since she never forewarned me. She never apologized nor showed any sort of empathy. 

I hung up after being on hold for over 15 minutes, I called 8 times each time someone picked up but did not say a thing. 

I will never ever spend my hard working money at this particular establishment again. I rather drive an additional 15 mins to the KFC off of Freedom Dr."}
{"text":"If I could no star I would. We didn't even get food, we went to drive through had 3 different people trying to do our order. When we finally got to the window it Atilla wasn't even right. It ended with us completely cancelling our order and leaving. Seriously we order two meals... a number one and 20$ fill up and they couldn't even get it right. smh... all I wanted was to defeat my kfc craving... well thanks kfc you did that without even feeding me!!! Sucks this is the closest one to me."}
{"text":"I have gone to this location before and my order has not been correct, or they are out of biscuits.  None of this is a big deal and since it is conveniently located for me I return when I have a KFC craving. However, I went on this past Sunday afternoon, and ordered a meal through the drive through.  Once I got to the window the girl told me I would have to wait 16 more minutes-time I didn't have.  I told the girl she should have let me know about the wait before I ordered and paid, and asked for my money back.  She was polite, and said she had to get the manager.  He was a different story.   The manager on Sunday night offered me the excuse of \"we only have one fryer\" and had to go to two separate registers to get cash out.  I had paid with a card, and apparently they cannot refund the card.  After watching him shuffle around with no sense of concern for my time (a paying customer!!!) he finally wandered back to the window and gave me a handful of ones.  He didn't offer an apology or ask me to return.  Since I waited so long for this fiasco he should have refunded my money and offered me a free or discounted meal. I am posting in hopes the franchise owner reads this and sees what type of customer service is offered at this location and does something about it before it closes down like the other KFC's have.   I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place Sais it's open till 11pm. I wanted KFC so bad. Haven't had it in months. I get there at 10:15pm. Waist my freaking gas and all the young kids are changed, lights are off and there heading out for the night. Don't think the big bosses would like the fact that now there's ANOTHER reason I should go to Popeyes chicken!!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Didn't send items on two occasions. Last time I'll order from these incompetent people. KFC, you're going way down in service. Keep it up and you'll be out of business at this location before you know it."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Everytime I have come here the people working are extremely rude and unprofessional. Every single time they forget something in my order.  No more KFC!
The young girl tonight was soo rude.  Where's the management? Where's the corporate management? All the KFC reviews, even different locations, suck. They will all be out of business soon at this rate"}
{"text":"They ran out of CHICKEN!!!!!!  Had to wait 20 minutes. Nuff Said. 

Michael was the manager btw. I vote for him being the worst manager of all time. Do I have a second? 

 This location should be named Kentucky Forgot Chicken"}
{"text":"This place can't seem to get it right 
Drive  through  or going in it doesn't matter. Went by the other day and went inside to get my granddaughter some mashed potatoes and gravy to take home when my wife said something had leaked  in the bag.it was the  gravy  the lid wasn't on  so my wife  cleaned up the potatoes  and got to the bottom and half of it was  melted  from the warmer they had it in  don't go to this place  can't seem to get it right.  Sad when you can't even work in fast food!!!!"}
{"text":"It was okay, not what I expected but I was satisfied. Although the atmosphere was great with good people and a great staff. I had a hair in my fries and they were happy to give me a new order of fries. I think they should wear hairnets so this doesn't happen again"}
{"text":"This place is the absolute WORST! They screw up my order nearly every time. Today they forgot to put the cookie in my meal, and they gave me the wrong chicken parts. The staff at the drive-through barely speak or are outright rude. Well, I am DONE! I don't know how this crappy location stays in business. I'd give it negative stars if that were possible."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. The cashier wasn't acknowledging. When she approached us about an issue regarding our large order; they were low on biscuits, she did not properly relay the information that her Manager suggested. She told us that we'd get 4 biscuits and can give us a pot-pie. We okay'd it. But when we received our order, we just received the pot pie. We brought the order back to the cashier's attention, who was paying more attention to her phone and directed us to the Manager. So it turned out that the Manager actually meant we can wait for more to be cooked or take the pot-pie instead, since she had just gave away the last four biscuits to her drive-through order. We told the Manager that was not what was mentioned, but we'll wait for a for a new batch to be cooked. Gotta love that facial reaction of a teenage-newbie in the work area...she could care less. The Manager was polite enough to place our packed order under the warmers until the biscuits were ready. As we grabbed our order from the counter, the cashier was in the middle of mopping the front counter. She had  placed the wet floor sign out facing the side entrance, but had left her wet mop leaning against the counter as she headed out the front door to answer her phone...way to be safe...!"}
{"text":"Cashier did not know how to back out an order. Another customer paid for the wrong order to get the line moving. Floor dirty, counter dirty, tables dirty. Order not take right. Cashier trying to sweep up the floor with customers in line. Many people standing around. No toilet paper in the men's room. Did not seem to have an Manager available to resolve problems 2 people came back with wrong orders. Two orders came up to the counter and the people had walked out."}
{"text":"The worst ever, just when I forget about the last time there and get hungry for KFC I go and within 30 sec I'm reminded how terrible they are,from being so slow and messing up your order and just plain rude"}
{"text":"I have visited this store twice and BOTH times they were out of extra crispy recipe....ok you advertize that you have it you would think that at dinner time you would make sure that it is available... I know it is popular so I would think you would keep it up. Next the macaroni was mush, I asked for corn on cob.. they no longer have it? and the biscuits were nothing but raw flour dough in the center!!  pay attention ppl! you are serving the public.. although I realize this store is on the border of Apache Junction.... it's no excuse !!!!"}
{"text":"Worst food. Got ripped off $12.00 uncooked raw chicken went into garbage when we arrived home. All cold food, real soupy mashed potatoes, dry Cole claw. Cold hard biscuits. Overcharged right and left.   But get this ! Nicest, most polite employees ever. Don't get it....."}
{"text":"Poor cashier service the guy doesn't listen will not be coming back when he is there his name is Eddie"}
{"text":"Quick fix for dinner after work but they always mess up our orders couldn't get it right.  I always order thru drive thru because it's less hassle.Idk how many times I get less than what I ordered and I will just found out about it when I get home! Arggh!"}
{"text":"Had to repeat a simple order, two times at the drive thru speaker and another time at the window and then they forgot my drink. Had to go to the store to get it , but had to wait in line, while I was in a hurry. Several times I had to hang on to the card swiper because they forgot to take it from me."}
{"text":"The lady in the drive thru was not helpful!! She was a bit rude!! I requested coleslaw with my order in which I received mashed potatoes instead. 

I requested honey and butter and she stated\" you have plenty in the bag\"! There was 1 of each!!  How did she determine that, that was plenty... Who was she, my mom!! Geeshe!! 

Wow am I disappointed with the customer service!!"}
{"text":"Would give it 0 stars if I could. Over cooked, drumstick looked like it came from a cornish game hen, not a chicken. Mashed potatoes were runny instant potatoes.  Worst food I've ever had."}
{"text":"Says it closes at 11 then they lie and say they have no chicken but clearly i see a whole lot of chicken in the window stupid staff"}
{"text":"Regular KFC. Quick service this weekend. Easy, greasy dinner."}
{"text":"Service 5 stars!! Food quality 2 stars 

First off I didn't have to wait in line which was awesome and the guy taking my order spoke clearly was really friendly and I was able to place my order quickly when I got to the window they charge me right away I got my card back within a few minutes and I got my food back really really friendly and really really fast. 
My order:

Chicken snacker
Small mashed potatoes
Small cole slaw

I was really bummed out to discover my coleslaw was still frozen and I had to wait 30 minutes to eat it. It sucked that the bottom bun of my sandwich was rock hard and I had to remove it to eat the sandwich, the pickles were also gross and soggy, i love pickles but I couldn't eat them. Mashed potatoes were good, chicken was great consistency!  I didn't have time to take the food back, but considered it. 


Great hospitality, could improve on food quality"}
{"text":"Received four biscuits in various stages of raw dough (one so completely raw that it stretched like playdough), a plastic bag full of leaked chicken grease, and burnt chicken tenders that were absolutely powdered with paprika. Worst $23 ever spent."}
{"text":"Ordered #10 Big box 3 PC. All dark meat. Got all white meat and charged me for 2 medium Pepsi's I which I did not get. 2nd issue with drive thru in 2 months."}
{"text":"I really love how this store is trying to turn itself around. They are really trying. The food is great.  The service is wonderful. I have never had a bad experience. They always have my order out in a timely manner. Thank you for everything."}
{"text":"I'm here.  Now. In the drive thru.  I got a coupon in the mail and needed some fried chicken.  Was asked to wait when I pulled into the drive thru. And I acknowledged, politely,  that I would wait.  And I waited. And waited.  5 minutes went by...6 and 7. The people behind me were leaving and I asked if he was still needing me to wait!  
\"Oh I forgot that anyone was out there\"

It's been a while since I've experienced anything like this.  

If the put this guy in their window, what kind of attention is being paid to food prep and cleaning?

It's a nightmare come true!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend wanted KFC so I took him to this location because it was the one closest to us. Well we went through the drive thru and there was only one car ahead of us, we waited 20 minutes until the car in front finally got their food and left. I was a little pissed because we went through the drive thru for a reason, for fast service! So, when I pulled up to the window, This girl (red head) was frantically trying to get our order together and the people's behind us. I then saw another employee (dark hair) just standing there, texting on her cell phone! She was just letting this poor girl handle all the orders and food herself. I think they should fire that girl that was screwing around on her phone because there are plenty of people who need a job and will actually work too. My boyfriend yelled through the window \"get off your phone and help her\" but the girl just looked at us, walked away and continued to use her damn phone. Not professional at all, please fire her."}
{"text":"KFC's newest intro - the Georgia Gold.  Options are available in 3 or 5 pieces, combos, and little sandwiches.  All Georgia Gold orders come with pickle slices.  

Crispy, spicy and sweet.  There's no lack of honey.  It's good.  I enjoyed it except the vinegar smell.  But that's BBQ for ya'.  They put the fluffy buttery biscuit in with the chicken so it soaked up some sauce.  YUMM-YYY!

However my KFC preference is their regular crispy two piece with hot sauce packets and their mashed potatoes with gravy.

Nice friendly service at this location.  Located in an area that attracts a lot of customer flow.  The time I ordered they could've had another person at the register.  They gave me wetnaps for my to go order; I didn't need to ask.

Fountain drink area a little unkempt.  Cup lids a bit disorderly.  

Doesn't stop people from wanting classic KFC bbq chicken.  Please lick your own fingers."}
{"text":"Ordered a bucket of chicken and coleslaw. Took over an hour to arrive and when it did it was basically sitting in oil."}
{"text":"Not so great chicken, and a service charge. Ordered two 10 piece buckets, one of which was total mush. Not a crisp piece in the entire bucket. In addition, I was charged a 39 cent service fee for using a debit card. There is now a sign in the window that this location charges a 39 cent service fee on all orders with a 39 cent discount for cash and CREDIT card customers. When I questioned the charge, and informed the not-especially-helpful cashier that my debit card can also be processed as a credit card, he insisted that it could not, and that their system charges automatically for debit cards.  What a rip off!"}
{"text":"These stars aren't for the food. It's for Cody working the front counter!!! He not only was fast and very polite but was running from the back helping with the food and packing it and also helping other employees whom seem not to know much of what they are actually doing. Way to go Cody. I hope they know what a gem they have with you!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 of the new loaded chicken bowls. Got the regular chicken bowls with out corn. Ordered 4 chicken littles no mayo. They didn't put mayo on them but they forgot the pickles. I guess that's what you get when you have kids working and don't care about customer service. Great job management."}
{"text":"At the nexus between busy 422, the heart of Solon's industrial area, and several hotels catering to business travellers, this place makes buku cash hand over fist from morning to night.  So it doesn't worry about food quality, getting your order right, or good customer service.  

Biggest complaint would have to be the wait.  During the weekday lunch rush (noon - 1 pm), you may spend 15 sometimes 20 minutes waiting in the drive-thru line.  Walking in isn't much better either.  It's simply a matter of capacity - they aren't set up for quicker production and therefore people sit or stand in line for an inordinate amount of time.

Next complaint would be their terrible customer service.  Sometimes you wait at the drive-thru order kiosk for 5 minutes before someone takes your order even though there's nobody ahead and seemingly no one in the store.  I've watched PO'd drivers just drive off in frustration.  Other times they get your food order wrong.  Twice I've driven away with something completely not what I ordered.  (Someone else's maybe?)  And you almost always get a crappy attitude at the window and counter.

I swear this place must be on a probation officer's kickback list...

Unfortunately it's the only fast food place open late with a drive-thru in the immediate Solon industrial area."}
{"text":"This review is not for the food, I like KFC's food, this review is for the customer service. So I go in and notice that there is a car with it's lights on out front and only one couple inside. The couple is complaining that they  still have not got their order, the clerk looks at them with surprise and says I will go get it and leaves the register. About 10 min later an employee picks up some bags of food walks by me and goes out to that car that was parked in front. This should have been a clue that they were running behind. Another few minutes pass, the couple still has not got their order and no one even acknolwedged I was standing their waiting to place an order.  I start to walk out and the employee that walked out earlier says to me \"Bye\". Really? I get being busy, I get last minute call outs that can make it hard, but to not even acknowledge a customer standing their for almost 15 minute is ridiculous, and to say bye without even asking why was I leaving is just rude. Again I love the food but it appears the manager needs to give a training class in regard to customer service."}
{"text":"Everytime we go through the drive-thru our order is incorrect. I think they do this on purpose because you are in the car and can't check. So disappointing when you get home. From reading other reviews, this seems to be the norm. I would look for another KFC if I were you."}
{"text":"Yikes....lots of bad reviews and I do understand why since I haven't been here in well over a  year due to previous terrible experiences. But this time was surprisingly different. Drive up employees were efficient and nice (which is a noticeable improvement!) Ordered #10 included 3 piece chicken, cole slaw, mashed potatoes and a drink for $8.99.  Chicken was good, cole slaw excellent, mashed potatoes w/gravy was ehh...to creamy for me.  So this place got it together or I just got lucky."}
{"text":"Its hard to rate a place on interaction of one said teenager female employee, but I must.   Here after referred to as HER.

Everyone here is of great professionalism, however the weakest link breaks the chain. 

My work friends and I find it a gamble to see who is working on the day we decide to visit. If it is not HER things are great and friendly and fast. 

If it is HER we get the blank, empty stare with no eye contact or customer service energy. Its like she (HER) rather be in bed sleeping or she could even by high or something.

I'm sure this store could figure out who HER is and fix the issue.

Also, why offer grilled chicken breasts if there is never any available?  Or it takes 20 mins to make but, wait, you drop the chicken of the floor (HER) and we wait 10 more minutes. But wait, you gave our chicken to someone else who walked in and out the door (HER) so we have to wait 10 more minutes again only to have to take our food to go because the lunch hour is almost up?

Or even worse, at another visit we asked for grilled chicken breasts and you say you don't have any?  Only way to get it is to tell the cashier that you will wait for it. 

Good luck on that. Might I recommend Roberto's Tacos or Yogi's Teriyaki in the same shopping center?"}
{"text":"If I could give NEGATIVE TWO Stars, that is what I would rate this place.  WHY WHY WHY did I ever come back here?  Seems like time does heal all pain.

I went through the drive through tonight because the wife was hungry.  We try to order with the bumbling fool on the speaker but they are too hard to understand.   Maybe that is why we didn't get what we ordered?

Or do they really have blatant disregard for what the customer wants?  We want grilled chicken breast.  We are told they don't have any.

WHY? YOU ARE A CHICKEN RESTAURANT!  Talk about unprepared.  You can't even give the excuse it's because of the dinner rush.  It was 8:50pm at night.

So, this is what we get: NOT what we ordered

- We settled for original since there was no GRILLED. 
- We DID NOT get our RECEIPT from the person at the window.  All we got was our credit card receipt. 
- So not can we not verify what we ordered but we can't even tell if they got the order wrong in the first place or if they decided to just stick it to the hard paying customer and just give them what THEY THINK that they need.  All I know was  I paid $16.73 and that is TOO MUCH for how much I got.  This is ROBBERY!
- I think it's unacceptable that they do not give out receipts. Does this night crew need a retraining?
- We ordered THREE chicken plate with white meat.  Everywhere else you get TWO chicken breasts and a wing.  What did we get?  We got a chicken breast and a wing.  Do people at KFC know how to count?  WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?
- Their number on the CC receipt does not get answered.
- I try to go to mykfcexperience.com that is on the back of the CC receipt... But you need the order receipt to be able to take the survey!

HORRIBLE.  Never again.  -2 STARS!"}
{"text":"What can you say about the King of fast food chicken. Well this location leaves a lot to be desired. Poor, slow, and unfriendly service. Not the cleanest place I've been to. Have not and will not be back. Was not pleased."}
{"text":"Walked passed this new upgraded updated KFC and it looks great inside and out. They have a short list menu  consider sandwiches at $5.99 and combos can stack $10+ for a meal. Can be expensive for fast food. The food is okay the waffle fries is what intrigued me to try which was really good I got the nacho mix flavor very good. The reason my low rating is there is only 20 seats here the price is a bit over the top. For fast good standards. There's free WiFi here"}
{"text":"Yelper Chris S described the awful feeling of reviewing this KFC best, \"I've thought about posting this review.  But that would mean that I'd have to admit in public that I've eaten here, and returned.  Well, I try to avoid fast food as much as possible, but once in a while I get a craving for something.\"

Speaking of cravings, my guy and I were doing some cocktailin' while we cleaned our place. I don't know if it was the cheap champagne or the dire need to eat after all that cleaning--but he suggested KFC and I said yes. I love fried chicken, biscuits, mac'n cheese and mashed potatoes. I mean, those are all delicious things. And I hadn't had KFC in over 10 years. Why not?

My poor boyfriend came back so frustrated and with an incomplete, lukewarm order. Poor guy. They missed our mashed potatoes and gravy that we paid for. And the food we did get wasn't hot or fresh. Plus, it was all so expensive for what we actually got. The only things I did enjoy eating: biscuits, chicken finger things and the popcorn chicken. However, the original chicken in the bucket was a huge let down. I think there was one, tough, barely recognizable breast in there. Otherwise there were just miscellaneous chicken parts so overly breaded that I felt uncomfortable taking more than one bite.

So yea, I admit I went to this KFC and ate the food. But I also admit that was a big mistake and won't be doing it again anytime soon--particularly at this location."}
{"text":"We were just passing by and the eating options in Surprise, AZ were limited. I have to agree with others here, I will make sure NEVER to frequent this location again.

We purcased a kid meal for my son but they failed to tell us that they didn't have any juice boxes, or fruit squeezes, both of which was shown as part of the kids meals. Instead of the juice box, they gave us a small drink (after we already paid). But there were no options outside of soda (which we don't allow our kids to have) so we ended up essentially paying for ice water! As for the fruit squeeze, they gave us an extra mac-n-cheese. Problem is, we didn't select that side. I guess they just figured they'd make our decision for us. 

I ordered a 3-piece meal that included two sides and a medium drink. Total came out to $9.84! Call me cheap but I think that is a bit pricey for fast food meal."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this place a one is because there are no minus. Units to be given.

This is the second time I've gone to this location with the same results.

When I entered there were four people standing in line with no one helping them.
Then the young lady came out and said there was no chicken, and it would take 20 minutes before there would be any ready.
Then after waiting 15 minutes the other girl came out and said the chicken was just put in and it would be another 20 minutes before the chicken would be ready.

While I'm waiting there were four couples who came in and left because no one came to take their order.

No idea how this store can stay open. THE WORST SERVICE IVE EVER SEEN.

Oh by the way, when they ran out of cooked chicken. Just before the dinner hour."}
{"text":"This place is TERRIBLE the owner should be ashamed. Poorly trained staff, orders all wrong and Food takes FOREVER. PLEASE save your time and frustration and go to another location. The drive thru always takes a solid 15 minutes and I wish I was exaggerating. WORST LOCATION."}
{"text":"We went to KFC and I ordered a 2 piece white meal after waiting in the drive thru. I received some small, sad meal. We received no napkins, plasticware or even a receipt. This is the worst meal I've ever received from a KFC."}
{"text":"Service was horrendous! A lot of clowning around going on and the manager was heading it up. Very slow service, good marginal at best. Dining room unkept and restrooms terrible. Don't bother."}
{"text":"Greasy chicken , it soaked through the bottom of the bucket threw everything away, once I stopped here and they didn't have chicken. I will cook at home from now on. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"Horrible experience every time I go . The drive thru employees are always so rude ! Today the lady got a attitude bc she asked me for 3 cent instead of breaking my cash I gave her . She was like TAKE THE DOLLAR BACK . handed me my food then slammed the door without saying anything ."}
{"text":"Horrible location, always a wait for anything. Ordered the 10 pc leg and thighs deal, got home and found a bucket of thighs with no legs. Took over 15 minutes for cold, wet chicken.
Also reported them to the SNHD, employees were handling everything without gloves. Witnessed an employee handle a mop then handled food without washing their hands, handled cash, then prepared another customer's order.
Bleh."}
{"text":"GROSS!!! Me and my brother got food poisoning I actually threw up from the chicken. The mash potatoes were a liquid. Thank god my daughter was asleep. If she would have got food poisoning I would have went back and blown that place up!
Stay away from this place and any fast food place honestly. I don't know what I was thinking."}
{"text":"20171003 - Giving 5 stars for this visit. Pleasant clerk at the window. Got a chik'n little combo. The nice clerk popped a ketchup packet, a ranch tub, and a BBQ sauce tub in the bag without asking for anything for my wedges.  I haven't been by in a while, so I don't know if this is a new procedure for all orders, but I found it very nice."}
{"text":"Actually.....it's a zero! Why KFC allows this place to carry its name is beyond me. The world's worst food,and charging a fee for using a debit card....really???!!!!!!! I hate this place!"}
{"text":"This KFC just closed down. No big lose because this was the worst chain store ever. The food was not available and sometimes undercooked. The employees were rude and not friendly. I hope they replace it with something good"}
{"text":"This location is always clean, friendly people, and quick service!  I recommend the family meal (extra crispy of course) & don't forget the cake!"}
{"text":"This outlet has a very warranted one star rating.

I have use this outlet on a few occasions and invariably there ends up being an annoyance that occurs.

Yesterday, I walked out before I could complete my order, ordering fats food is supposed to be quick simple and come with a friendly smile. It should not be an ordeal. An order should not have to be repeated several times because the person working the register in a combination of inattentive and inept."}
{"text":"2 reasons for not returning.
1. No potato wedges
2. Corn dog nuggets were still frozen in the center."}

{"text":"Worst KFC ever!;;  no extra crispy and when I got my order it was wrong.. Ordered all white, got all dark.. wife ordered tenders and popcorn meal.. Got just the pop corn  chicken, no biscuits in either meal.. What a home and now they get paid 10.00 an hour.. What a joke... Go somewhere else.. This place is run terrible..I was a manager of a kfc many years ago and would fit the entire crew if this was my store..."}
{"text":"The service was fast and food was good. I hadn't had KFC in years, but it's what Bryan's Dad wanted for Father's Day and it was surprisingly good."}
{"text":"PROS- KFC in Surprise AZ is the BEST! Whenever I have my 2 favorite servers (Nancy or Cookie) They always do it right! Me and My grandmother come here every Friday. 90% of the time. It is perfect. Our food is fresh and hot, and The two of us get out for 15.00-17.00 It usually comes in 10 minutes. A good wait time. They take everything seriously, and we always get a good deal!

CONS- Sometimes Highschoolers are behind the counter, and it messes up orders.
             No janitors.
             In summer, hot as hell.

I give KFC in Surprise, AZ my 5 stars, Bravo, Nancy and Cookie, You've earned it!"}
{"text":"It is unbelievable when you go to a chicken restaurant and they tell you they are out of chicken! Several times we have arrived there for crispy chicken and the response we get is \"oh we're out of crispy chicken\".  The managers have a lot to learn about supply and demand. It has happened to us so many times at this same KFC.  It is such a waist of time. This is the last time we choose KFC. I am glad Churches is just 6 blocks away."}
{"text":"This location food has fallen gotten so bad lately I will not return after my last visit yesterday.. I arrived shortly after it opened and ordered a 16 piece bucket. When I got home the chicken taste like it was already a day old and had pieces that were cut in two and passed off as somerset pieces. This is the third case of bad food I've gotten from this location if the last year. It's a shame it used to be one of their best. From now on I'll try the Erin Mills town center location or Mary browns"}
{"text":"I could have written any of the terrible reviews of this place.  It is terrible.
I stopped in for a few dinners to go to go to the Spring Mountain Ranch theater.
When we got to the theater we discovered....
no dipping sauce and no butter in the package.
I ordered the Georgia Gold but with one original and one krispy. Both were in our box with the 
    hot and spicy rather than our ordered choice.  This chicken was so dry and horrible we would
    not eat it, and they put the biscuit in the same box which soaked up the terrible sauce.
The only thing we had from KFC for dinner was the slaw....the usual store made stuff.
Luckily the theater had food trucks.

NEVER AGAIN this place....but if YOU go be sure to have them open up the order and YOU check everything is correct.  This is not our first time here with a problem, but it will be the last. 

The Eniglish spoken by the order taker was mainly nodding yes to what I wanted, and then 
doing it the way she wanted since she did not want to ask me questions.  NEVER put this
kind of person on the front  line in a takeout place. Your order will always come out wrong.

The hot and spicy (a newish item) is terrible.  To say it was like shoe leather is a compliment.
So dry and tough you could not even get one bite.  Tossed it away.  The burros at the park turned up their noses at this junk.  (just kidding)."}
{"text":"I don't know how many times I can come here through the drive thru and never receive a spork. Everytime I never get napkins or a spork. All I'm asking is to be able to eat my damn food."}
{"text":"Nothing in my order was correct, fries are Cold, I ordered grilled chicken and got breaded chicken did not even receive all the items to my meal missing my cookie to  my $5 box.. Do not recommend this place to anyone .."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna comment on any of the food here but the service at this location is always fast and efficient. This is the nearest KFC to me since the one on Centennial closed down a little whille ago. I'm definetly not ashamed to say I loves me some KFC."}
{"text":"Pot Pie was the usual
..yummy!  However, my husband wanted the tenders.  How can they be out of tenders during the lunch hour? We were told they were thawing. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I stopped at this KFC/Taco Bell on my way home one time and they were out of most of the KFC menu.  The drive-thru cashier was rude and very short with me and offered no options for me when each of the first 3 items I tried to order were already sold out.  Not going back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the service and food have always been just so-so.  I do think the drive-thru takes longer than normal to complete your order,  but no major complaints."}
{"text":"This place was so awful   doesnt even deserve a 1 star.... got chicken and when we got  to my daughters  and had chicken i new it was bad by taste when you have been brought up with KFC  you just know plus my granddaughter got a chicken leg it was just all bone deep fried  granddaughter said its so hard no meat  it was awful   and  i had a piece in half  and just couldn't  eat any more    and when i got home within 2 hrs  i was so so so SICK  God I was so sick   This place so need food inspectors   It was the worst i ever had   My daughter got so sick also ..  Never eat here again  and i paid  32 dollars  for food Poison    :P"}
{"text":"This place is a joke - Go elsewhere and save your money. Ordered the grilled $20.00 fill up. When I got home, thought they only gave me a half bucket but looking closer at the very small, dried pieces, they were all their. What a joke, a newborn chick has more meat on it than these pieces. Will NEVER go here again. Of the last 10 stops here I would say that 7 of the times they were out of the grilled. (I go else where) I hold my breath as going through the drive through to see if they have it. Two times ago when I got to the window the girl said \"sorry we are out of the grilled\". I complained and here exact words were \"they why do you stop here\" Guess what, NEVER WILL AGAIN. Very pore management and a cheap owner."}
{"text":"Their customer service is so terrible they rip the surveys off so people don't let their corporate office know or DM whoever is in charge of this place needs to clean it up came into with rap music blaring and the clerk didn't bother to say hey how's it going welcome to KFC nothing just took my order took my money gave me back change did not count it back too me and just put my cup on the counter didn't bother to hand it too me or anything even Mc Donald's employees Hand you the cup the gentleman who handed me my order was polite but 9 times out of 10 service SUCKS just as much as the food"}

.8 people walked out as a result"}
{"text":"HUGE SHOUT OUT TO TINY! I don't normally go to KFC,..but the hubby and I were in the mood for chicken...drumsticks in particular...and obviously I wanted the most bang for my buck...all I wanted was chicken and biscuits...I looked at the menu and it looked like the best deal was to get a family meal of 8 pieces,..but it came with 2 large sides that I knew neither the spouse or myself would eat.Tiny helped me figure out how to order what I wanted without getting all kinds of extras that I didn't (I.E. sides) She noticed my frustration while trying to figure out how to explain what i wanted and made the transaction easy. Thanks TINY!"}
{"text":"I have no troubles with my orders or food when I come here.  My beef is that they're a bit on the slow side.  There's only one person working the counter (poor gal working her butt off with taking the orders, processing the orders - cash, debit, or credit card, and then packing the orders and giving it to the customers).  Meanwhile there's about three or so persons working at the rear cooking or doing whatever.  There were times when at least two to three people were waiting for their orders, while the one girl who was working the counter, was looking after one customer in terms of taking his/her order.  And at the same time two to three more customers come in and form a mini line.  Note that this is a small place.  It gets crowded.  They should have another person working the counter at the same time."}
{"text":"Fast food ?!? not surprised about their 2 star rating 

If you consider almost a 20m wait as fast food.

Understandably - most fast food establishments serve drive thru customers faster than dine in customers...

However when other patrons who order after you get their food before you - you have to wonder ?!?

Cornelius said... oh we were waiting for the popcorn chicken ?  then instantly my order is made. 

The #7 food was at room temperature - so you would think they wouldn't prep half of the order if still cooking popcorn chicken ?
So one order is semi-hot ?!? mash hot but popcorn chicken warm and the other room temperature ?!?

Well that would be nice to know there is a WAIT BEFORE you order not 20 mins after you order.

We could have chosen another option.
Or maybe even another restaurant !

Also saw them PARK FIVE cars that went thru the drive thru ?!? Why to make their time look good ?"}
{"text":"My experience at this KFC was so bad, I downloaded YELP, just to express my disgust. 

Not surprised to see many others have been here before me to leave unfavorable reviews.

Sunday night the place was dead empty. Horrid cold CFL light bulbs. That color that hurts your eyes.

We come to KFC for the chicken, not the experience. I had four hungry boys with me, so I feel fair in giving my opinion based on group consensus.

Been to KFC all over the world. Germany, Dubai, etc...

This chicken was bland and completely void of the signature flavor and TEXTURE you expect from KFC.

If I were of a different personality, I would have asked for my money back.

Drive the few extra miles and avoid this particular restaurant."}
{"text":"Got a craving for some of the Colonel's finest fried goodness and utilized the drive-thru. We had to wait while they made a new batch of crispy, but were compensated with a free drink while we waited. The food was exactly what we were expecting from KFC. It satisfied the craving. A return trip is in order the next time the craving hits."}
{"text":"Pretty good location.....clean....not very busy during the times I have visited. The customer service could be better....and the place could use a little pick me up so to speak...but all in all it's close to my apt. when I need a KFC fix."}
{"text":"KFC has a pretty good lunch special for $5.00. chicken, biscuit, mashed potatoes and a drink. Good place for a quick cheap lunch."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible, terrible. I really have no idea why I came here. Other than the fact that it's raining and I was on my way from the office. I haven't eaten this crap for years. I attempted to spend over forty dollars for 16 pieces of chicken. But they didn't have enough extra crispy to fill my order, so I requested that they throw in a few pieces of Nashville Hot to complete my order. Apparently, this is impossible even though I was sitting in the drive-through in the rain for five minutes before they responded to me. 

I think I was speaking to a manager at some point, although he clearly didn't care that I was about to take my business elsewhere. Which is exactly what I did. I will never set foot on their property again ! Business must be pretty good to throw away a decent check on a Friday night. Good riddens !"}
{"text":"This location is the second location nearest to my home. The other location on Baseline pass Rural Rd in Tempe is terrible. I come to this location as they are very quick and if something will take longer they let you know before they complete your order. Normally it is the 20 count of hot wings that take longer. They are very courtieus and helpful. The restaurant is very clean and neat. Lastly there are no derilects hanging in the restaurant doing nothing and harrassing the customers."}
{"text":"The worst Fried chicken. they didn't put any chicken breast in a family pack,  the biscuits were old and smashed plus the phone is not even working in few words I don't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"this kfc is no longer a part of the major kfc franchise and it is really obvious because for one the customer service is the very worst! yes don! this means you! you served us some nasty ass burnt chicken and didn't even give us a receipt with our order. when we got home we opened the bucket and it looked like the chicken had been burnt in a fire! it was old, really dark and hard as a rock. so we drove all the way back to return it and don had the nerve to tell us there wasn't anything wrong with it! well, i'm not serving that crap to my family.. matter of fact i don't even think they are using the 11 herbs and spices cause it didn't look anything like the real kfc chicken. anyway do not go to this kfc.. we tried to call them and the number on the internet is disconnected so i asked don for the manager's number and he refused to give it to me.. he told me i had to go back the next day and talk to the owner.. this kfc should be called kentucky fakeass chicken!"}
{"text":"This KFC SUCKS! 2night the drive thru clerk asked,\"Like to try our grilled wings?\" I said \"yes.\" She said, \"sorry- we don't have any.\" WTF?"}
{"text":"This really has to be the worst KFC. Very slow, orders almost always wrong. Just now we sat at at the window for 10 mins (another 8 minutes in line after ordering, 2 cars ahead) before they bothered to come tell us they have no chicken ready and it would be an additional 10 mins."}
{"text":"Terribleeeeeeeeeeee service from the girl in the drive thru, it was a brunette with an engagement ring on her finger. No name on her tag just blank,i order the combo number #5 I tried to change the mashed potato for a salad, but she get me a nasty look like i was a joke to her, she replied nop it comes with mashed potato. Poor girl she is in the wrong job , no clue about customer service, food ok but service is embarrassing !!!! It was Sunday at 4:31 pm a brunette girl very RUDE!!!!, people do your self a favor and go next door to mc Donald."}
{"text":"The service was a bit slow because there was a customer that was asking a lot of questions regarding their coupon. But we got to try their crispy chicken instead of original . I asked for all crispy chicken but somehow 1 of the drumstick was original . The crispy chicken was a little spicy. The washroom was really dirty. Though I would say that the cashier was nice enough to give me one of their kfc coupon."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. The girl who was at the end to start the order was sitting with her back to me playing with her smart phone... Then looked at me as if I was rude for interrupting her.

I got the big boss burger which was cold presumably because they pre-make so many and let them sit there.

I really like the concept, but every time I've come in there (3x now) the service has not been good."}
{"text":"I went to the store at 9:30 what is an 8 piece meal they were closing the store an hour before they couldn't even give me an eight-piece meal they didn't have enough prepared totally unprofessional totally ridiculous"}

{"text":"Just wanting a snack and so happy they finally got the nuggets which is what i ordered.. What a huge disappointment, what i got was nothing like advertised on tv or plastered all over in pictures.. I got maybe three edible pieces, the rest was fried dough, tiny pieces with nothing in them.. It was actually disgusting.. And my husband biscuit was so hard you could not eat this.. I will never eat here again.. this is not the first time they have given us old food that was sitting and bottom of the barrel.."}

About half way thru searching the website I was so frustrated that I almost threw my computer out the window!!  Did I mention that I'm \"borderline\"?  Seriously, your website is just plain LOUSY!!  Thanks for reading!"}
{"text":"My experience both times I've been here was awful. First time I went through the drive through the worker talking through the microphone had THE most terrible attitude. It wasn't anything he said but just the tone in his voice was that of someone who obviously didn't like dealing with customers. I could tell he just hated his job and wanted to take ot out on everyone else. Was trying to decide what I wanted but the guy was just being very impatient and acting as if I was making his life a living hell by taking a moment to look at the menu. I would have filled out the survey on the receipt but the guy didn't even give me a receipt.

Second time I came, I didn't really wanna go but my wife wanted some boneless skinless chicken and kfc was the easiest place to go, after I ordered I asked fir another container for my wife who was at work and the employees gave me the dirtiest look as if I was asking to.sleep with his girlfriend while he watched. The nerve of these people, its as if they feel entitled to take out their frustrations on others because they have a crappy job. And THAT is why I'll never go to that particular kfc again."}
{"text":"I have been to this location three times in the last month, three times they did not have what I wanted available or it was going to be a long wait. Very disorganized and disappointing."}
{"text":"Isela has a bubbly personality and so sweet. Great customer service and should definitely get promoted. Never have a ever been to a fast food place and felt so welcomed."}
{"text":"A stain on the Taco Bell name.  You should remove yourself from Yelp.  And then slit your wrists."}
{"text":"I have given this location several attempts (10 or more) to gain me a customer, but sadly they do not meet my expectations. The biscuits are hard 50% of the time. I usually get the chicken strip box, don't really care that it's a little more than the national advertisement of $5. The strips have been so hard that I can't even take a bite, let alone chew them, this didn't happen just once, but several times (you would think I would stop going). The service is usually decent, nothing to rave about, typical employees that don't seem to enjoy their jobs. The part that really pisses me off is the sauce, one sauce for 3 chicken strips. I ask for another and they charge me for it. They also stopped serving the Finger Lickin Good sauce, which was the main reason for my choice of chicken. Twice I was given food without a receipt and when I tried calling, no one answers. I fill out the surveys when I do get a receipt, but honestly, I don't think anyone from corporate cares. I would avoid this location!!"}
{"text":"This KFC is an absolute disaster, just went through the drive-through completely screwed up our order wrong drinks wrong order no napkins no spoon to eat my bowl. Didn't get a receipt to see how much we paid.  Corporate KFC needs to get involved with the store. The girl at the window and an attitude. Never going back."}
{"text":"Tried the new Pickled Fried chicken. I love dill pickles. All you taste is pickles. The juice/sauce they use takes over everything!!  Unless you REALLY crave (and I do mean crave) a dill pickle, I would not suggest it. Even if you, go buy a pickle."}
{"text":"Ordered two items, food came out fast and hot. Taste was ok, nothing special. All of the booths were worn and torn. Definitely needs some renovations."}
{"text":"Is the worst place ever, they have been bad for years and we try to avoid going to this KFC; however, we pulled in today and ordered some food and there is a sign in the window saying no refunds... I can see why, that should of been the first clue!!!  we got some chicken strips got home and they were burnt and small and  over cooked!!! It was like jerky. The meat pie should've been called a vegetable pie. This place still sucks !!!"}
{"text":"When I arrived the place was pretty empty besides one woman in the back eating her meal,  I was not greeted when I arrived at the cash register, instead  while  I was waiting I saw a gal walking around but she did not greet me or tell me that someone would be with me shortly, So I proceeded to wait, then a tall guy came and took my order after he came back from a break an was told by another employee that looked like he was clocking out that I was up front, he did not seem to happy about taking my order as I had it written on a sticky note, instead he said he didnt understand what that was, So I explained my order,  I ordered a 16 pc and was told that I would have to pay extra for the 8 breasts & 8 thighs which is fine because we don't order back, legs and wings,  then ordered our sides mash with gravy, corn, mac n cheese, an coleslaw.

The person bagged everything nicely, I didnt get asked if I would like plates, but I saw him put some napkins in the bag so I thought I would at least get forks and honey with butter packets, I got home to feed my kids and noticed that the chicken was over cooked & dry and really greasy with brown grease coming off of them to the point where the bottom paper was tinged BROWN, the biscuits were cold an kinda hard & the mashed potatoes & corn were cold. So I had to microwave the sides for my kids, we ate and myself and my husband got a bad taste in our mouths from the grease, it stung the back of our throats and later that night my kids ended up feeling sick an were very restless an couldn't sleep, my daughter ended up throwing up an having to sleep with us because she was getting up every so often to use the toilet. 

I woke up this morning at 10:00 am  to call that location to either talk to a shift leader or manager and the line is stating its busy pay money for centrylink for something, figured okay its Sunday its to early let me wait half a hour, called again same thing. I thought to myself let me call another location time was 10:40 am, an someone picked up and actually assisted me, A very helpful employee named Shep a shift leader he stated from the val vista & elliot location. He gave me the number to a area coach Donna who didnt not answer instead I had the same message saying line busy pay $$ for centrylink, So I called the val vista location back and it went to the managers machine so I left a message and YET to have someone call me back about this poor service. 

The location for my complaint is for store location : 882 

2453 South Gilbert Road, Gilbert, Arizona
(480)739-2968

Every time I call I get the same message to pay centrylink. 
 
This experience was not worth me paying 51.73 and having my kids get sick to the point where one is still in bed feeling awful makes me upset knowing that this happened from this locations FOOD!!

I will never go to this location & I already told my neighbors about this locations service and my kids getting sick, my husband & I refuse to go to the South Gilbert Road location,  but Shep offered to give us better service at the Val Vista  location, but after this experience I do not know unless we try that location, as this was very hard to swallow an I am still upset my that my kids had to go through this."}
{"text":"I wanted the tenders and wedges for 2. And I explained to the lady what I was looking for because one of my employees ordered earlier today.

He said \"tenders for 2\". So when I got to the window after settling for the sadness bowl with everything mixed together.  I asked again for the the tenders for 2 deal. She said yes it 6 tenders in 1 box and wedges in the other box.  That's exactly how I explained it. WTF? Of course they already ran my card and offered nothing for the issue.  I would have giving up this nasty food shake they call a sadness bowl. Fml!"}
{"text":"One of the only lone standing KFC restaurants left in Toronto, this location has been around for many years. It offers parking space and 5-6 tables inside.  

It's been countless years since I've been back to indulge in Colonel's greasy goodness. I came with a free coupon to try KFC's new sandwich, \"The Zinger.\" Promoted to be a spicy addition to their menu. 

I hate it how chain restaurants promote new products, by changing 1 or 2 things about their original items to attract customers (Think Burger King). It's the same ol' chicken burger, with a spicy-mayo-salso type sauce that wasn't one bit spicy. And it was priced at $5.49 for the sandwich itself. Mine was free and I didn't even want to finish it. 

Last attempt to recollect childhood memories of visiting a KFC ever again. 

Move aside, Colonel."}
{"text":"I don't really like But  review just I don't recommend  no one -go there because I swear I will never ever go back there even it is for free"}
{"text":"This place doesn't know how to make food in a timely manner.   They seem to always be out of chicken.  The workers must be mismanaged bc they are lazy and slow."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie. KFC is my favorite chicken place ever. Not sure what the hype is about Caines. I prefer good 'ol Original Recipe KFC. These guys have the best coleslaw ever! Very prompt in the drive thru. Super easy when you don't want to cook! The full ups are a great deal! No problems with the staff."}
{"text":"Epic. Fail. Waited in the drive thru line for close to ten minutes with only myself and someone getting their food at the window. They had not made the ice tea for the day even though it was close to 1. O'clock. They were out of strawberry lemonade.

When I got my order there was a medium drink instead of the large I had asked for. The girl was super sweet and apologetic. I ordered a chicken little send which and the chicken was cold. Shouldn't be eating here anyways due to the fried factor. So I won't."}
{"text":"We had a problem with our order through the drive-thru and the manager Hugo expediently addressed the issue. He exemplifies excellent customer service. He exceeded our expectations and helped make a not-so-good experience in to a five-star-worthy experience. All restaurants should be so lucky to have such a gentleman manager! Thank you again!"}

{"text":"I'm new to the neighborhood and have frequented this store twice now.  Both times my order was screwed up!  While the food was average they could not get my order right!  Tonight they gave me the wrong recipe on the chicken and even though I requested extra butter and honey they gave us none.  When I attempted to contact this store directly no one answered any of my repeated calls.  There was an additional phone number on the bottom of the receipt for Comments, Concern's and Complaint's, but that went directly to answering machine.  Don't know who runs this store but they have lost me as a customer!"}
{"text":"It's a KFC that never has chicken.  You go at 7, 8 or anytime and they have no white meat, they have no crispy, they have no original.  They ask for your order and then tell you they don't have anything you want to order. Their thing is supposed to be chicken and they never actually have any chicken.  It's pathetically sad.  Who owns this crap hole?"}

{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of KFC, but I will break down once in a while and eat it if the family wants it.  Another Friday (no cooking for me), so had to decide what to pick up.  My wife suggested KFC, its on the way home and you get the chicken and all the sides and buscuits and crap... so I said fine, I wanna try the new grilled chicken.

It was ok... kinda rubbery?  Tasted ok, a bit too salty.  But, you gotta remember I don't really like KFC chicken to begin with.  Maybe its because my own chicken is way better (TOOT TOOT!), or maybe its because KFC never fucking cooks theirs right?  Its always slimey inside and way too much coating outside... bleck!

Anyway, I had one leg and scarfed down a ton of those fake mashed potatoes and jelled gravy.  For some reason those taste really good to me... weird.  I had a couple bites of biscuit... yuck (another case of me making them better).

But I do love the cole slaw, and I have the clone recipe which tastes even better than the one you buy there... I think because its fresher?

Sorry KFC... but you suck.  You're certainly no Daphne's or even Taco Bell or Jack in the Crack.

I guess that's what I get for boycotting cooking on Fridays!"}
{"text":"Sadly a few return trips to this location I post this review...today I ordered a 12 piece strip (as I often do) and after I got home I noticed that I received a box full of tiny scraps consisting of chicken nuggets at best scrawny pieces of strips and bottom of the barrel things that should've been thrown away.
This is not the first time yet every time.
The last time that I got the same 12 piece strip at this location there was barely any breading on the strips or it was falling off.
The time before my box had old dried up and barely the size of chicken nugget pieces in it.
Sadly this seems to be a management issue I have alerted the manager to the problem and things do not get better.
To pay $14 for a package of 12 overcooked chicken nuggets just does not make sense to me... there are many other places in the area that you can get a good meal for a much better price...
This is what 14+ dollars gets you at KFC in Olympia"}
{"text":"By far the most incompetent crew out of all the fast food chains I have ever been to. I have given this places numerous chances before making this post. But FUCK this place and all their dumb ass employees. Who the FUCK hired these ppl? They need to get fired. 
You have people that can't take orders, place order in bag property, take payment properly, give change properly or offer customer service. Whoever is the owner of this franchise needs to clean house or sell it since you obv don't know how to control your establishment. Get your head out of you ass. #-100stars #youowemestars"}
{"text":"Always a hassle at this KFC. Half the time they have no plastic knives. Some people like to eat chicken with a knife and fork. On the subject of forks, all the sporks at all KFC's are so thin they deform at any temperature over 90 degrees (see photo). The store was empty but the tables and floors were a mess (see photos). Their chicken was good on this trip, but not worth the hassles. Not a pleasant experience. I'll be back in 6 months....maybe.
UPDATE 12/20/2017
Stopped in for a pot pie. Congealed garbage with little chicken. KFC, close down your stores. No hope!!"}
{"text":"Rip off!!!!!!!!! Now kfc restaurants have taken a shortcut to reduce the use of chicken in every ad in their menus. Just recently my mother had the $5 fill up combo with 2 pieces of chicken, small fries, chocolate chip cookie & pop. The chicken is all batter less chicken meat, their sandwiches are even worse. 2 chicken strips instead of the chicken patty. As for the recipe not anymore that's also changed. Very disappointed in kfc restaurants,
All of fast food now has taken the backseat to pulling scams. They want to do business but don't want to give more of their products in return. Shame on kfc. Other alternatives if one wants real chicken Mary Brown's chicken hands down. Highly not recommended."}
{"text":"Kfc chicken sandwiches are total rip off nor longer chicken pattie, just 2 small chicken strips. As for the kfc chicken recipe has been changed not so great anymore. Better off going to mary brown's chicken, a & w chubby chicken, any type of rotisserie chicken. Very expensive ain't worth it. Highly not recommend."}
{"text":"Went to the drive thru and was greeted by Jeff. There's once in a blue moon where I receive really wonderful customer service especially at a drive thru, and Jeff was one of those rare occasions!

Jeff not only helped us with our order but he also didn't leave any leaf unturned. I haven't had any one at a drive through let us know that we were getting a drink holder, and asked if we wanted all different kinds of sauces, substitutions, ect. When we pulled up to the window, he let us know what we order and made sure he had our order correct, there in some utensils, our sauces, and napkins to enjoy our meal. 

Jeff is he definitely one of those who really pay attention to the smaller details and just really wanted us to enjoy our meal with his great customer service. Which I really appreciate a lot.

Hope to run into Jeff again. Really made me want to come back to this particular KFC. 

Thanks, Jeff!"}

They are out of chicken or the food comes out cold and old.  If you want KFC is recommend making the drive to a different location.  This one leaves a bad taste in your mouth (pun intended)"}
{"text":"Bad bad bad KFC! Worst location I've ever been! I don't know why I keep trying it again and again and hoping it will get better.  Took a bucket home that cost almost 17 dollars.  It was nothing short of trash worthy.  Cold, bland, dry, stale, tasted like it was cooked 8 hours ago.  Sooo disappointed but not surprised as I've never had a decent meal at this location."}
{"text":"I see this KFC/Taco Bell is already rated pretty low, which is no surprise to me after my last experiences there which span over years.  I am finally reviewing it and hopefully this will keep me away forever.
  
First I had promised myself that I would never go back, and yet I did yesterday.  This was after a few months ago when  I added a cake to my order that was suggested by the attendant taking my order at the drive-thru. I broke the cardinal rule of ordering via drive-through which is not to check your order before you drive off.  Yes, I arrived home and the cake was not in my order, a total waste of $5.  It's like just taking a 5 dollar bill and throwing it out the window.  Sure not enough to break the bank, but enough to severely piss you off.  At that time, a year ago, I promised myself I would never go back.  
  
Yet yesterday I had a hunger for some chicken strips, my son suggested this place.  I said any chicken fingers from any place would be fine but he wanted KFC so I gave in.  He spent $25 dollars on two chicken fingers meals!!!  If he had gone to Burger King or Jack in the Box, we maybe would have spend $14 instead of $25.  The problem is, KFC bundles their chicken meals (bone in or bone out) with piece orders with 2 sides AND NO DRINK IS PROVIDED WITH THESE MEALS!  So he orders 2 large drinks along with the meals which were 5 piece chicken finger meals, with cole slaw and home fries as sides that came with the meals.  I DID NOT WANT TO SPEND 25 DOLLARS ON TWO FREAKING CHICKEN FINGER MEALS!  
  
I am now going on a cruscade against this company and I will be writing them about this.  Plus here on YELP, I am reviewing every KFC within a 25 mile radius of where I live and they are getting one star (wish I could give 0 stars)."}

My husband's zinger was ok, but too much mayo.  The potatoes wedges were over cooked and dried out. The dinner cost $15 and change and it wasn't worth the money! 
If you don't mind a dirty place to eat, and getting the wrong food. Go for it!"}

The chicken was dried out which seems to be a common problem at this location. Even the poutine was different. Undercooked fries and not enough gravy. 

Go to another location."}

The menu says the spicy zinger sandwich is sold out, yet the #1 the regular zinger appears to be available...nope that one is gone too, so how about putting a sign up for that one as well? So I order the chicken little combo instead...now from previous experiences I know they are stingy on the mayo, so I ask for a packet of mayo...they no longer have those...the little twit in the drive thru offers no alternative. Please do NOT tell me these people deserve $15 an hour. Their customer service skills are lacking, they can't think for themselves, a computer has to tell them what to do, and they put forth the least amount of effort possible. Regarding the quality of the food...the chicken was dry and hard to swallow, and the fries had a weird taste."}

I then went to get myself some sweet tea from the container that said \"sweet\" on it and it wasn't. When I went to ask about the tea, the cashier had to short change another customer. I finally told her to get the manager because no one should be \"owed* change. I was told she was busy bagging food. I asked how many people had to wait for money before she wasn't busy any more. Eventually, the manager came over with change. I asked her about the sweet tea and was told that they had run out of sugar and put the tea in the wrong container.

Yes, you heard me right in 5 trips to this KFC in Surprise, Arizona I have never once got my correct order. The worst part is of the five times where the orders were incorrect I attempted to return the food twice and was given grief by the employees.

We were so nice & didn't deserve that at all! I ordered food but after hearing & seeing her terrible attitude, Bobby decided not to order. She literally slammed my cup down & then informed us their pop machine wasn't working. We had a choice of sweetened, unsweetened or raspberry tea as well as water. Her attitude was just beyond disgusting & rude!! We ender up asking her name to call corporate. We couldn't find the corporate number & ended up speaking to the shift manager who said there is no corporate number bc they are transitioning (yeah right) . The manager said she would handle it. That didn't seem to change anything because the cashier & her terrible attitude were still at the register representing this store in a terrible way!!! Never again!!"}

The girl who helped us was pretty nice and accommodating, she let me switch up my meal last minute with no attitude. Didn't get her name, but she had dyed red hair. The wait wasn't too too long either, eventhough she told us the tenders would take an extra 4 minutes since they didn't have any already made. Pretty satisfied for a fast food chain, although they forgot our biscuits, and the chicken tenders ended up being room temperature."}

My only word of advice is once you get your order...DO NOT LEAVE THE STORE....Stop and individually remove each container from each bag.  It seems the larger the order...the more they dont include everything.  I can assure you that if you dont...you will get to your families house and you wont have coleslaw.  Are you going to drive all the way back for it?  No.  SO what then?  Call and get a free tub of coleslaw for a later date and time?  No.  Mark my words friends....check yo' bag before you leave or drive away.  The food?  Dude its KFC....its like eating a stick of butter deep fried and then rolled in sugar.  The food is always good but bad for you.  This review is strictly about the location and its forgetful staff."}

It's 10/6/2015 at 4:00pm.  I literally waited 20 minutes at the drive thru window (and still currently waiting) for anyone to come take my god damn payment.  This has to be the worst way to conduct business.  

The manager, Julia, didn't even bother to talk to us, instead just walked out of her shift.  Good job KFC, get your shit together."}

It is apparent that employees have no interest in providing any sort of customer service. It looked like I was interrupting an employee discussion when I approached the counter. After about 30 seconds, one of the employees walked up to the counter and said, \"what's up, what can I get for you?\" I can understand being informal with customers but this casual, non-professional attention doesn't work for me.
To top it all off, the food took a long time to be served and in the long run, I learned a lesson, this place will never be worth my time again."}
{"text":"Back to the olden days. New management again and the service is slower than ever before. I must say, I think I've given this location enough chances. No more for me thank you."}
{"text":"Stopped by after the KFC in Sun Lakes closed and purchased their coleslaw and was short about one serving in the container. I thought I would get a full serving.  Next time I'll watch what they do and request a full size.   I can see why the Sun Lakes restaurant closed as the serving sizes were about that of a pigeon."}
{"text":"I visited here again today after over 6 months, shows you how much they impressed me last time I visited. Went inside, visited the bathroom and found the soap dispenser empty, makes me wonder how the employees wash up, then out to order. I wanted extra crispy but was told they didn't have it for about 45 minutes, but I could get original receipe in about ten minutes. OK, I can wait 10 minutes, got my cup, off to the soda machine, found the drink I wanted was out, told the manager about both the soda and soap and got the famous glassey eyed stare of, \"What the hell do you want me to do about it\" Looked over receipt and noticed a 39 cent surcharge on my bill for using a debit card, that is a first I have ever seen. Got my food and sat down to eat, when finished it had been about 40 minutes, the soda machine still wasn't refilled and the soap dispenser in the bathroom was still empty. Well I goy my sharpie ready and now,  another place crossed off my list of possibilities of having lunch."}
{"text":"I gave KFC, Chandler 1 out of 5 stars due to bait and switch, refused to answers phone to take my complaint, and the restaurant was filthy.  I was going to wait a year before going back giving the owner time to hire better competent employees and cook better foods, but reading the complaints, it got worst, the owner should closed it down, they spending too much money on advertising and everything else is poor quality."}
{"text":"Allow me to be the first to write a good review, I guess. The only reason for 3 instead 4 stars is because they only had mashed potatoes and coleslaw for sides. Otherwise, the two times I've gone I've had good customer service and my orders have been correct. Perhaps it's s luck??"}
{"text":"I can't seem to find a damn KFC Drive-Thru that's precise on their orders! I ordered a meal and it's either I don't have the cookie or this time, the biscuit! The biscuit! Wtf yo?!?!!! And no receipt! Shouldn't I get a free meal for that?!???"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. The girls working were using terrible language and I was with my kids. They were talking loudly about their personal lives The whole restaurant could hear.  I could also hear the employees complaining that depending on my order she would have to cook more and she said she doesn't like to cook. I have definitely been to much nicer KFC's!"}
{"text":"This is your typical KFC but not your typical customer service for KFC. Food was wonderful just like I would expect it to be. I would have given 5 stars as the kept to their protocol for the food but the young lady that took our order never smiled once. That was even after I asked her if she liked her job. She said yes and asked y, I said bc you've not smiled once since you took my order and she still didn't smile and then apologized. This was a second time speaking with her as she forgot to give us butter for the bread. I guess these day they'll take anyone with no customer service skills to fill the position. These business better figure out that if they have bad customer service, then why go at all to the stores/restaurant's. We will as customer just order online. Trust me if I order food online it wouldn't be KFC."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times and each time they are out of something..it's almost as if they don't want to work.so they don't cook anything. On top of being out of chicken the customer service is always bad. They never know what they are doing. Left last night and went to the sahara location..thankfully that location was nice and had fresh chicken"}
{"text":"Came here last night  after leaving the location on spring mountain cause they were out of everything ( as usual ) 
The person taking the order was super nice, they had me pull up front and I was thankful that all of our food was warm! Oh and I didn't have to ask for honey! I always forget to ask.
I should have asked for a name :(
It was a girl taking the order and a young guy brought  my food out"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service and took forever in the drive thru! There were 3 people ahead of me so not terrible, took me a few minutes to place my order which is understandable, however once I got to the window, they somehow forgot to place my order and I had to wait 5 more minutes just for my order. When I asked what happened the lady said we didn't put it in, no apology took my payment and closed the window, only reason they get 2 stats is because food was fresh, it better be after the long wait. Very frustrating"}
{"text":"Came today and they actually gave me my substitute lol gained a star back!
--------

This place is always a horrible. 2 stars cuz the food is good. I go to KFC once and while and at every location I get the $5/6 box. I always substitute the mashed potatoes for Mac n cheese and no one has ever given me crap about it. EXCEPT this location!!! I asked to do it and the guy said you have to take it the way it is no substitutions period! So I got irritated and just said never mind I'll take my fat ass to Taco Bell right next door!! Bye  Felicia!"}
{"text":"The food was good but they didn't give me a biscuit with my box order...
I was really looking forward to eating that too...


Update: they stole my credit card Information stay away!!!!"}
{"text":"Warming food - I love their chicken nuggets,
And the service is good but their soda machine had a wired flavor, seems like no one really care about it"}
{"text":"Always late, don't deliver to our door. Always an excuse with that group. No follow up etc. Very poorly run KFC. By far the worst I have ever experienced.
I also prefer my chicken to be plucked before being served it...
Overall very gross and very poor customer service."}
{"text":"Wow .......I just had to write a review for this Taco Bell 
Cause I just had the most ridiculous experience ever !
Ok so we're in a rush ...so what does this mean ?
Hello Drive thru.........what a BAD MISTAKE ! 
IT TOOK 19 minuets ...yes I said 19 minutes what a joke ....then they gave the wrong order and wrong receipt .....so we go back in to complain and the manager says to email head office ....wow! Email them what a JOKE!!!!! GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!"}
{"text":"Pros: Employees were very friendly and always had a smile. I love me some KFC chicken original recipe!!!!!! The fries are great!!!.

Neg: The place could have been cleaner.... it was a bit dirty and run down."}
{"text":"I drove through they didn't have crispy so they asked me to wait 17 minutes 24 minutes later it's still 3 more minutes and they are puzzled about why we are not happy"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal at any KFC. Yum in my book. Love the crispy more than anything else but I can any of the Coronels recipes."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service ! 
Ordered a number 5 asked for crispy and the guy upfront says oh well I already put in original so... I guess do you want me to change it... Um yes since you messed up... So asked for a refund and he said that we would have to give back my meal as well HAHA. WHAT!?? Not to mention he came up to the counter with a mouth full of chicken and grease on his mouth ehile flinging the tongs around that are used to grab food for people to eat .. get your act together little one your a brat"}
{"text":"Worst Taco Bell ever always out of different soda every time I come. No sense of urgency it's suppose to be fast food but waited in a line for 15 min just to order. Cashier was so slow and so was all the people in back someone should light a fire in there butt for sure"}
{"text":"I waited about 8 minutes  before I got to put my order in.  They told someone they didn't have crispy breast.  When I pass my order, she asked  another employee  if they had hot wings!  Ummmmmm KFC you sell chicken right?   I don't eat this, just making a run for the hubby.  I would have left if it was just for me. It didn't long for my order, and the lady that took my order did tell me to check it before I leave. 
 AIN'T NO BODY GOT TIME FOR THIS!"}
{"text":"This people are so stupid I bought a family bucket and wanted 4 extra biscuits they said they didn't had any extra I had to wait 5 min so I parked in the front to get my extra biscuits.

I get home they only put the original 4 that I had with the bucket HELLO!! Why in the fu]{{ did I waited more than 5 minutes for if you were only going to put the 4 ! I guess they don't know how to add 4+4 =8 not 4 I want to know what school you go to so I can avoid it lake the plague!!!!! 

This is the 2nd time I hardly ever eat KFC but my little one wanted to eat some chicken omg last time they did not even asked I add 4 biscuits they replaced them with potatoes wedges  they just did without asking you assumed I like them??? 

Like I said stupid people! Ahhh and I'm calling the number on the receipt more than 7 times never picked up the phone  I can't give them less than 1 or Ill do it!"}
{"text":"Staff was great, Nashville hot was very good, potatoes are is terrible and biscuits decent but sooo much plastic!"}
{"text":"For the first time ever, I have to say that this location has the worse grill chicken I ever had in my entire life and this is suppose to be a restaurant that is supposed to specialize in chicken!!!!  The grill chicken was very dry down to the bone.  Very disappointing for a restaurant that I use to love."}
{"text":"I had a mad craving all day for KFC. I stopped on my way home from work and got a 3 piece meal. I got a soda as part of the meal. My chicken was awful. It tasted like it was cooked in old oil. I ate some of it almost an hour ago and my mouth still FEELS like it has a film in it from the oil.  My soda was FLAT.  My biscuit was FLAT ( it was not because of the ice because I had ordered it with no ice).  I called the store and they said they would replace the CHICKEN but that in addition to bringing my receipt, which is understandable, i had to bring back the CHICKEN!  I called the 800 number for kfc and they are compensating me for the WHOLE MEAL.  I love kfc but will NEVER go to this location again!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come here something is wrong. A few months ago they were out of original white meet,  then it was when they stopped serving grilled and they acted like i was crazy for asking for it, tonight on the Monday chicken fried special they r out of gravy.... think this might be my last trip here"}
{"text":"Although our order was prepared fast, the cashier had absolutely no personality. I don't usually feel that I have to check my to go orders from from KFC but I will definetely check every item in the future. After getting past the hard biscuits we opened a container of \"gravy\" which was just was brown water. In all of my years eating at KFC throughout the country, this was a first. So either the cooks were lazy or KFC has changed their recipe. I am sending them a video and will hopefully get an answer. I am giving them one star because I am holding everyone responsible for this. They all saw the brown water and still served it."}
{"text":"I was so excited to get a KFC in our area. My first visit took FOREVER and the food did not taste good when we got it home. Maybe they need some time to get established and we might try again. For now, it's back to Durango for us."}
{"text":"The VERY worst service ever! I ordered inside and watched them fill all the drive thru orders: After 20 minutes; I asked if it would have been faster if I had ordered from my car and was told  yes-: I then asked for my money money bacj! Everyone left angry!@$#!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru and ordered a 2 piece extra crispy chicken dinner. The chicken seemed to be over cooked, the biscuit and cole slaw was fine but the chocolate chip cookie was also over baked and slightly burnt."}
{"text":"On top of our chicken being cooked perfectly and coming out quickly. William went above and beyond to get us our cake that we forgot. Its obvious he cares about his customers thanks William and team ... this location cooks the best chicken and everything is always fresh best KFC location I've been to"}
{"text":"It saddens me to say that my experience with this KFC was short of satisfactory.  I ordered delivery from this location about 2 months ago and followed up after one hour passed and my food was not delivered.  The person who answered the phone was rude, didn't seem to care, and to quote, \"Ma'am I couldn't call you, but your order is still here.\"  

WHAT THE FUCK!?  

What kind of pathetic excuse is that anyway?  Anyway, she proceeded to tell me that there were not enough people doing deliveries that day, which I can understand, but that whole \"I couldn't call you,\" is a whole lot of bull.  Ended up cancelling my order, never got a proper apology.  Awful."}
{"text":"I dont know what is their minimum job requirement but most employees sound like school kids with no education or manners whatsoever. Takes forever to get 3 pieces of chicken. Nothing is ever ready. Always forget to put napkins and other stuff with your food. Even after you ask them to."}
{"text":"Regardless of early or late they usually have a good selection of food, at lot of locations nearby like to tell you they're out of practically everything and you should order something else but not here."}
{"text":"On my way to the airport I wanted something fast that wasn't McDonald's, Wendy's, Taco Bell, Del Taco, Carl's Jr or Jack In The Box.

OH LOOK! KFC across the street. I always said I wanted to try it. Mostly because I haven't had KFC in a long, long time. I think the KFC I ate in India didn't count, because it was in another country...anyway, I digress.

Whatever you do, don't go. Please, don't go. I took a verrrry big hit for the Mesa/PHX yelpers in going here. I'm surprised I didn't get food poisoning. The place is disgustingly filthy. The tables were sticky and from a distance they all looked clean until you sat down. I wanted to cry. I really did. It's such a huge contrast to the other fast food restaurant I went to.

Booths were unstable as was the clientele. I felt really overdressed in my grubby jeans and grubby shirt.

The cashier and the servers were friendly and nice...I think they realized I was the only customer that wasn't high on something. I was truly disturbed by some of their patrons - they were walking adverts for \"DON'T DO DRUGS\".

I think this KFC/A&W really killed any and all future KFC cravings. I said that this place wasn't good for kids - mostly because I'm worried they'll catch next year's strain of the flu - yup, if you want to get your immune system up, come here. 

Ok, going to go shower now that I remember what this place was like. *shudders*"}
{"text":"Every time I go to this kfc they jack up my food. 9 times out of 10 they forget food or forget pieces that go with the food. Example: Tonight I got 2 chicken littles and after I ate half of one I realized there were no pickles. This sandwich isnt a chicken little without the pickles. Like wth! Buttttt I am too lazy to drive back so I ate them anyways. This place is always a hot mess too. Like pieces of chicken on the floor in the kitchen, pieces of trash, boxes and just trashy!"}
{"text":"Just went thru the drive thru and experienced the rudest customer service I have ever had. From start to having the bag tossed at me at the end, amazingly rude. Never again!"}
{"text":"Got to window ...coke no ice...replaced coke...was flat ...3rd times a charm...ordered 2 piece dark meat with mashed potatoes gravy and corn....get home ..no silverware napkins or butter...no corn...food cold....not what I ordered...first time to this location ....will never come back...just worked 12 hours and all  I wanted was an edible hot meal!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was one of my worst experiences with a delivery man. I made my order over the phone and requested to pay with debit. I also requested for additional hot sauce and ketchup (which was specifically stated on the receipt).
The delivery man comes to the door talking his phone through on his headset. I proceed to take out my debit card and he says that he did not bring his machine. I was extremely frustrated.
I closed the door and went to ask my friends for money (it was originally my idea and offer to pay for food which looks bad on me).
When opening the door, the driver was again was talking on his headset.
Upon exchanging money, I took the food and the driver went his own way. I opened the bag and to my surprise, there was no hot sauce or ketchup in the bag. I called the store and it did not seem like the person cared about my situation. I will not be ordering take out from KFC again (this goes for all KFC stores)."}
{"text":"This is the WORST place to eat!  I went threw the drive thru and nobody was in front of me or behind me and it was the WORST experience ever. I PAID $28.76 for 8 pieces of old dried out chicken 2 cold sides of mashed potatoes and a 3 piece tenders that never got eaten.  They were like rubber! awful!  I love eating out and I don't mind paying but the good must be edible! I tried calling the store to buy they never picked up.  They know there bad.
Go to chic filet down the street."}
{"text":"How hard is it to do your f*cking job? I just wasted $25.00 on crap that I didnt order. 9:30 pm, only one in Drive-Thru, store is empty and I get the wrong shit! REALLY?!"}
{"text":"Had problems every time I go there. First time the cashier screwed up my order. When I took it home I was pretty upset but won't go back because it is rather far. Complained online to get a coupon for this location so I ordered hot wings ahead of time by calling. When I arrived the food wasn't cooked. The manager who took my order left so I was mad. Today I went back to try to use this coupon again and I came into a restaurant full of angry mob. They were short handed but proceeded to screw up orders and ignoring taking orders from people in the restaurant and catered mainly to the drive thru. It took me 40 min to get 10 hot wings. I did manage to use my coupon but won't be going back there until they change management."}
{"text":"Never had a problem with this location - judging from other reviews, I think the cooks should check the food for quality before handing it out to people but this is what we get for cheap fast food."}
{"text":"A fast food joint must be exceptionally good or extremely bad for me to  write a review on it....In this instance, it's the latter, ugh!

My mom and I went thru the drive-thru and she ordered a 3-piece wing something-whatever and at the window they tell her they are out of wings so would sub it for 3 drums. The drums might as well have been wings as tiny as they were. The short thigh in my meal was practically a wing also. 

After we pull off I realize they did not give us any utensils/napkins. So I go in and decide to use the restroom while I am there. Pure filth, worse than a gas station bathroom! There was no toilet paper or paper towel in the dispenser whatsoever and it was strewn all over the floor. Even the soap dispenser was empty. The restaurant itself was in fair condition. It was obvious no one had paid attention to the condiment/utensil station in a while either as it was a tad messy and I took the last ones...

KFC staff were coming in and out of the building and hanging out around the side of it. Hey, maybe they were clocked out (likely not). Either way it wasn't a good look, especially with the bathroom a mess!"}
{"text":"Found a chicken brain and spine in the 'thigh' which was in the bucket of 8 pieces... Lost my appetite immediately!!  I looked it up to confirm that it was indeed a brain and a spine.Took it back and the manager got angry and intimidated me while also getting very angry at the cashier.  I WOULD NOT go here."}
{"text":"Oh my, it's no wonder they only have one full star. We went drive through ordered popcorn chicken Big Box a few other item and a side of potato wedges. We had to wait away from the drive through to wait for our order, we were offered no dipping sauce for the chicken or wedges, no napkins, no sauces offered for the biscuits, no forks for the mashed potatoes or and sorry they ALSO forgot our wedges and gave us mashed potatoes instead. Never ever going to this location again crappy crappy service.."}
{"text":"Bad service. Drive thru person even repeated that I wanted a large coke.

I pay for my food and she gives me my drink first. I say, it was supposed to be a large, keep in mind I already have my receipt. She says, no you didn't.

I said, then why does the receipt say large? She said, oh I made a mistake, you want another one? Gee, let me think.

I then go to leave and there are three people smoking cigarettes with untucked shirts. Nothing worse than the entire cook staff smoking it up while making your food.

Their shirts looked like they fell in the fryer as well. 

Beware ye greasy shirt cookstaff at KFC Bellevue.

Poor service all the way around. 

The appearance of the staff made me not even want to eat the food."}
{"text":"Why must I give a star?!?!?!? This location deserves ZERO stars. I ordered a 10 pc family meal at 10:00p.m. to be told they were out of chicken and would need to wait 20 minutes. Pulled to the window to pay and asked as a courtesy and for the inconvenience may I have an extra side. The \"supervisor\" Jayme told me they are unable to give anything for free and if I didn't want to wait I can go to another location.

Waited out front and decided to call their 24/7 customer service line. As I am discussing the situation to the rep and after 20mins the little bastard Dean came out with my food. I politely asked if I can have dipping sauce as well. He tells me I didn't order chicken fingers therefore dipping sauce will be a charge. I said excuse me. You make me wait 20 mins for my food and can't even give me dipping sauce and he says that's correct. I then let him aware that I was on the phone with their customer service department and he says so. And told me his name and  even spelled it out!!! I was appalled. The rep heard the disrespect and was very apologetic. 

Can't wait for the follow up call to let them know how awful their associates are at this location and how badly they are representing their restaurant. I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS LOCATION WHICH IS ONLY 5 MINUTES FROM MY HOME!"}
{"text":"Been here the staff is very fast and friendly. I always enjoyed the food. My fav: I used to always order the toonie uesday which I liked for a while. Then I would feel sick after eating it. It never settled well in my somach. I think KFC needs less fat and oil.  If they would improve this they would be amazing."}
{"text":"This is the most disgusting kfc! Drove across the street on my break and when I got back to work to eat my meal this is what the mashed potatoes looked like! So gross the gravy was crusted! Threw it straight into the trash! Thanks for wasting my time and money your business should be ashamed of its self for selling this to me! 

You can see the picture of my mashed potatoes in the photos. Absolutely disgusting! I can't believe people who work there are so gross and lazy that they can't even do their job of making the food properly. Instead they give out what looks like days old mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"There are times when you need a fried chicken fix and over the years KFC is the place I turn to most often.  I always get original recipe and usually mac and cheese and cole slaw.   I have been to this location a few times.  Here the entire kitchen is open and they always seem disorganized.  In the dining room one of the trash containers was full to the point stuff was spilling out on to the floor.  One patron had to call her friend on her cell to ask at the counter for toilet paper.  I am sure I will go here again in the future because there are the closest KFC to work but I am glad I don't need a greasy fried chicken fix often these days."}
{"text":"This place serves cold old food after busy hours.What a waste of my time.I asked if I could substitute a biscuit for the coleslaw.um no you have to have that no substitutes.Ok well I don't want the coleslaw you can keep it.they then looked like huh??Told me What are we supposed to do with it IDK give it to car behind me I don't eat that!! SMH I should have went to rainbow kitchen next door!!"}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of Popeye's Chicken for over a decade.So I was excited to try KFC's new Nashville Hot variety.You have to purchase the chicken with a side for $5.99.A bit more expensive than Popeye's.The breast I ordered was a major disappointment.The breading was very tough and rock-hard in several places.The meat itself was tender and juicy.The breading was not nearly as flavorful as their Original Recipe.And not all that spicy.I was a little disturbed when I noticed a puddle of red oil floating in the bottom of my to-go container.I won't be ordering this product ever again."}
{"text":"It's true that I don't go to KFC very often on Sunday we stopped at 6181 W Lake Mead at approximately 4pm there was no coleslaw to be had. 
I asked for crispy chicken and then she asked me if I wanted crispy or original.
I also asked for extra honey and didn't get any honey at all, would I go back probably not.
I do have to admit that the chicken was good.
Service could use a little help"}
{"text":"This place is a nightmare cluster fuk. After waiting for 40 minutes we decided to get a refund and leave. No one seems to be in charge, all orders have a issue and the limited staff are running around like chickens with their heads cut off."}
{"text":"This KFC is worst by far. The old Indian guy working there is rude. Your order food in the drive thru and after waiting 30 mins in line they tell you they don't have the food your ordered."}
{"text":"Hours said they're open until 11pm, came there at 1015pm and waited at the drive thru and no one answered. Called the store and they picked up and told them we were waiting at the drive thru and they said sorry we're closed at 10. What the ****?! Yelp said you're open until 11 and if you're closed why did you even answer the call and asked us how can you help us? The only reason anyone would be calling is to get some food. What a ridiculous place."}
{"text":"I know this place has a lot of bad reviews but when I ate here today I  had a great experience. My food came out hot and fast. Sometimes when it's too fast you think  \"how long was it sitting under the heat lights\".? I had zero issues. My mash potatoes were amazing. Always ask for extra gravy. The restaurant was clean and the staff made sure the tables were clean. The nice girl who took my order was very personable and so sweet. While this location is in an older part of Mesa still check this place out."}
{"text":"I don't even like that I'm giving them one star . They deserve 0. We had to wait over 20 minutes to get our thighs we ordered and on top of that got my whole order wrong . They were rude and not helpful . We will not be back ."}
{"text":"This is probably the best KFC location in Charlotte. Or maybe even any fast food for that matter (considering everywhere screws up my order one way or another). My order is correct every time, the popcorn chicken is actual nuggets and not balls of tiny bread that's fried and impossibly hard to chew like I see at most locations to the point I have to order two popcorn chicken just to get enough actual chicken. Finally a fast food place where the staff isn't just completely incompetent."}
{"text":"Waited for five minutes at the drive up window behind another car, then when I got up to the place where you order nobody responded. Waited a couple more minutes then drove up to the window -  and no one ever came. Honked, still no one.Yes, the restaurant was open. Drove off and went somewhere else. Very weird"}
{"text":"This place is awful. Never had a good experience here. They are constantly out of things, today they were out of all types of sauces, corn, and anything extra crispy. How is this even possible!? The employees are some of the rudest people I've ever met. That really must be one of this locations top priorities when hiring people."}
{"text":"the store manager at this kfc, teresa i believe, is one of the most horrible people i have seen working as a customer for many years. constantly belittling her employees, in front of customers no less. food is horrible but not as bad as the service i have seen from this manager. disguisting."}
{"text":"I got a bucket of chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy, corn and biscuits. Thoroughly enjoyed everything. I am usually one of the people that fights for a leg but this time I got stuck with a chicken breast and it was surprisingly juicy. The mashed potatoes and gravy are for typical for KFC and satisfactory. If you're looking for a quick lunch for a few people this is a good choice. Easy and fast, and it really hits the spot!"}
{"text":"So I haven't been to a kfc since the bad experience I had on the one on lake mead that was the dirtiest fast food restaurant I've been in for at least the last 5 years. I don't like this kfc because they charge you $.39 for using a visa check card, even if you use it as a visa with no pin. I have to use my regular credit card here to avoid the $.39 transaction fee kfc charges. I don't remember any other major chain restaurant that charges you extra to eat there. I give them one star and don't recommend this kfc"}
{"text":"Beware of Brandi!!!! She is the Rudest and Most Unfriendly employee I have come across in many years.  She carries the biggest \"I could care less about the customer attitude\" possible.  Before I could even order my 2nd item she turned he back on me and started packing the first item I ordered.  When I asked a question about ordering wings pcs. She was very short and snappy with her response. When asked a follow up question she answered \"that's the way it is NOW\" It was as if she was a robot on an assembly line screwing nuts on a bolt. While still trying to complete my order and talking to her, she begins taking an order from a drive- through customer and ignoring me.  Note: The restaurant was not busy.

As a result of her, I decided pay for the one item and leave. I did not ordering the other chicken items, sides, and desserts I normally order when I do take out from KFC. Todays' check was only 14.00 I usually spend over 40.00 at this location for takeout. 

I then went down the street to Church's Chicken to complete my order.  I prefer KFC's food but the service was much better at Church's. 

She alone is reason enough for me not to return to this location."}
{"text":"Very poor management.  
Tried to order the 10 PC meal.  Asked for extra crispy.  
Employee says they don't have any.  I asked why?  She said she doesn't know with an uninterested look she gave me.  
And was dumbfounded when I said never mine I'm just leaving."}
{"text":"Normally I wouldn't even bother writing a review for a fast food chain especially if it's inside a food court, but this annoyed me so.  :/ 

I'd usually order the popcorn chicken snack box if I'm not feeling too hungry (or the $5 fill up but they didn't have that) but I feel like the snack at other locations give a pretty decent amount so I would say it's worth the 3.99. 

However, at this location they give you SO LITTLE my box was practically empty?? Besides the fries there was very little popcorn chicken. 

Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I am from California Visiting Las Vegas. My husband and I decided on KFC, service was horrible, cashier never looked at us, never smiled! 
They had the air conditioner on when the temperature outside was in the 40s... It was freezing, I couldn't enjoy my meal, couldn't wait to leave!"}
{"text":"it has one star, because its required before i can tell you how HORRIBLE this location is.
OH MY GOD!
its like they went to fremont and hired any possible preson who was desperate for a job. a couple of the associates smelled, thats right SMELLED. like body odor. seriously? take a shower, youre in customer service let alone the FOOD BUSINESS! the kid at the register seemed as if he just got back from smoking a blunt in the back and although my order was repeated back correctly, it was received INCORRECTLY!
when i went back to get them to do it right, it took 5 minutes before i had to yell to the back to get someones attention. then the person that ended up fixing what was wrong fixed it with no gloves. god knows what she was doing before considering all staff disappeared to the back. the people behind us waiting for food even said they had terrible customer service. at one point i got so tired of waiting i climbed over the counter for ketchup. on top of all that, when my boyfriend got his food, it looked like the person who made the sandwich got hungry and gouged a piece of chicken right out of the center THEN proceeded to put it on the bun. food looked old, overcooked, dry, disgusting! 
i ended up handing everything back and demanding a refund.
absolutely ridiculous staff!
start hiring people with educations and people that show respect to those around them by BATHING. this place needs to be start over from scratch. from building to employees.
worst KFC, ever!"}
{"text":"This has been the worst service I've ever received in a drive thru. The first girl asked for our order 4 times, then would tell us \"no stop. Gimme a sec.\" No sorry. No please. No manners at all. Then we got Tashauna, who was just as rude. We  started to order, and we get a \"ughhhh HUUH? I CANT HEAR YOU!\" We got 2 orders of the same thing but on mine instead of the 4 pc I got a 6pc. And apparently \"were friggin killing her with this\". 

If KFC is too hard for you. Find something else."}
{"text":"This little place needs help...I think the employees want to please their customers...but service is slow."}
{"text":"Had a little \"problem\" but Charisme took care of it and made me go from an indifferent to a very happy customer. Wish all KFC employees dealt with little issues like that. Customer service done right!"}
{"text":"My daughter went to the store to buy dinner for us at 7:30 and I guess my mistakenness not telling her to check the order before driving away.
She ordered a 12 piece bucket, biscuits, two mashed potatoes and gravy, a side of beans and macaroni and cheese.
When she got home we had the beans, Mac & cheese, biscuits THREE mashed potatoes NO gravy and 10 pieces of chicken, mostly wings.
My daughter called the store and they wanted her to bring back the entire order so they could verify that we were telling the truth.
The employee on the phone was very rude and was just short of accusing us of lying.
We took the order back and the manager was nice, verified that the order was wrong and replaced the who order. 
I asked if we could be compensated for the inconvenience (it was now 8:30 pm) and she gave us two tiny pieces of pie.

I will find another KFC to frequent even though I have to drive farther!"}
{"text":"Ive been waiting on my food for over 15 minutes and the cashier by the name of Dillon, which I'm not sure that's the girl that was waiting on me, has yet to even check back with to to say that my food is almost ready or coming? I'm never coming back here again. Several people have come in after me and they are eating their food."}
{"text":"I would give this ghetto place no stars if I could. I normally wouldn't even give a review to a place like this but this particular location has the absolute worst customer service. And people should know about it to avoid this location at all cost if it all possible. They have sucked for years, you can't go through the drive-through there without having to stop and go in because they screw up your order.  Not once or twice literally every time we go into this location. They hire ghetto ass employees who don't give a rats ass about anybody or their quality of work or what they do or how they do it. It is sad and it's shameful I understand this is fast food. But still....avoid this location at all cost hopefully they Will go bankrupt and shut down because our service sucks so bad. Oh and also they give you attitude when you go into question their screwup which is even love more lovely isn't it?"}
{"text":"Fries soggy and cold. Chicken horribly salty. Burger not good. Manager was kind and offered a refund, SKIP fast delivery and nice.  Just save your energy."}
{"text":"Since the Reno the place is a lot nicer but they really need to keep those tables wiped down a little better. 

Food: standard enjoyable KFC, we've never been disappointed. 

Service: the person behind the counter is always nice and ensures that the order is correct."}
{"text":"Just left here.  I cam right at 10 pm when they closed.   They actually encouraged me to order. Sherry helped me and she was soooo nice and so was the man who took my order.   It was so nice to order from here, when they could have been rude because they were closed.   
Thank you!"}
{"text":"Service is lacking. Food us hard and old when you get it. It is unclean. Bathroom has paper towels everywhere. Booths are full of crumbs. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Okay I have to preface this with the fact that this is been the first Taco Bell that I have eaten at in over a year. So to be honest I was expecting to be over whelmed because I have been wanting these foods forever. However I couldn't have been more disappointed. It started with the fact that when I first got there I had to use the restroom. The first stall was solidly plugged up and no way was I even venturing into it. So I went into the second stall and sat down and proceeded to complete my mission and  lo and behold no toilet paper!  So I went out to join my hubby in the ordering process and I ordered one each of all of the following: regular tostada, regular taco, a Mexican pizza, and a bean burrito with sour cream and lettuce added plus a side of salsa.  I knew there was no way I was going to eat it all but those are the items that I had been craving and I thought at least if I had a couple bites of each it would make me happy.  Hubby ordered three pieces of chicken and a side item.  So when they charged us they overcharged us (by double the price of the meal) but Hubby said I'm not supposed to mention that in this review because they did rectify it. The Mexican pizza was pretty good. The tostada actually sucked a**. Hubby's chicken was really good. The taco was good and the burrito was okay. To be honest our biggest turnoff was the cleanliness of the place not only in the bathrooms but of the dining room as well. There was more trash on the floor underneath our table when we first sat down than we had after finishing our meal. Needless to say I do not think that we will be back anytime soon. I just wish there was another Taco Bell in the neighborhood that could show this place how it's supposed to be done!"}
{"text":"Came here, ordered dark piece meal.  Was told by Megan, the manager, they were OUT OF DARK MEAT.  I asked to substitute with wings instead, even though I wanted dark.  They charged me $2 more because white meat is more.  Im sorry, is it my fault you don't have ANY dark meat chicken.. at a chicken restaurant??"}
{"text":"Wow- I should have looked at YELP before stopping here.  19 minutes for 2 meals to go! Dirty kitchen!  Rude, indiffernt staff!   DO NOT Go to this location!!!  Whataburger is right next door!"}
{"text":"My roommate and I ordered separately. I ordered a 2 piece, he ordered a 3 piece. The cashier was friendly, but the dude putting the orders together mixed them up, giving me a 3 piece. I know some of you are thinking why I didn't just take the free piece, but I was raised better than that so I didn't. When we tried to tell him the mistake, he got all pissy and copped an attitude with us! Hello! We're trying to fix YOUR mistake!! Even his co-workers were trying to tell him I only ordered a 2 piece. The food was good, but his attitude completely ruined it. We'll go to the Church's Chicken across the street next time."}
{"text":"Never again. In all my years I've never had service is poor that Jonathon gave our car. Rude abrupt obnoxious and inconsiderate. If you don't want to work for KFC maybe you should try another place with fries.That is if they'll have you... Somewhere in the South Colonel Sanders is rolling over in his grave."}
{"text":"I was greeted by a friendly cashier as I entered and my order was taken immediately.  The price was outrageous but I paid it cuz me and the kids were hungry. The order was ready quickly and we were served with a pleasant attitude. The Restaurant was clean And everything was well stocked."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru and ordered a 'Go cup' . Was told they didn't have potato wedges. They let me substitute a side item for it which was ok. I also ordered a medium soda and a biscuit. When I got to the window. She hands me a bag with just the go cup. Doesn't get my biscuit or my soda. She told me she didn't here that part of my order but she repeated it when I ordered it. I also was no given a receipt so I don't know what I should have paid or who it was that served me. I mean, how do you run out of food in the middle of the day? Sounds like incompetent management and poorly trained staff.  You want $15 an hour? Get the damn order right!"}
{"text":"We went back here a few weeks ago. Management seems to have figured it out. Staff was very nice and helpful and the food was good again... YAY!"}
{"text":"Fast food is not my thing but hostess of get together burned chicken so I grabbed some on the way after looking online at menu.  Grilled option was actually good and while high in sodium, calorie content wasn't bad especially compared to the regular fried chicken!

Fast and pleasant service at drive thru."}
{"text":"Teeeeerrrrible drive thru service ever!! I'm on my hour lunch and was picking up lunch for my boyfriend and I.. Sat in the drive thru window waiting to order for 5 mins.. after I placed my order.. (I ordered a 10 piece meal) sat at the window for another 5 mins before she even came to get my card to pay.. after I paid.. she gave me my food and drink and I asked for honey.. she gives me 5 packets.. I asked for extra cause my boyfriend likes to put honey on his chicken.. she gives me an attitude and says I have to give her a minute.. comes back and tells me they are completely out. Lol... Remind you!! My car is the only car in the drive thru.. there was no other car but mine!! Lol.. this is so pathetic!! All you have to do is take my order and take my payment!! How difficult can your job be!! I get home.. the gravy spilled everywhere! Good thing I asked for extra gravy.. and I didn't know that they just throw biscuits in with the chicken now.. I couldn't even tell you who took my order because she didn't even give me my receipt.. like are you fucken kidding me!! Great service!!! Just great service!!"}
{"text":"Devin was very friendly and got our food out in a timely manner very good customer service from him good job!!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would, just went through the drive thru about 10 minutes ago, the female manager is totally rude when we asked for a receipt she said \"oh you wanted one?\" Uh yes of course we did. She asked us to pull forward than never came out to give us our receipt.  They didnt give us mashed potatoes that we had ordered. No napkins. No butter or honey. Didn't even ask if I wanted sauce for my chicken tenders & when my boyfriend went inside asking about the mashed potatoes she knew that they had forgotten them & had decided she wasn't going to let us know that they failed to complete our order. Upon writing this, my boyfriend was about to take a bite of his chicken little when he noticed one of those blue seals they use to close bread. I worked at KFC as my first job out of high school & my manager would have been fired on the spot for the way she treated us."}
{"text":"I normally like KFC. I don't have ridiculously high expectations; it's fast food chicken. But this experience was beyond disappointing. My husband ordered the Carolina Gold chicken strips, and what he got was inedible. 

First, they were absolutely tiny. Nothing like the picture on the menu. Second, they were so thin that they were more like chicken fries than tenders. Third, they had been sitting so long that they had permanent bumps on the backside from whatever they had been left on. Third, they were like jerky. So chewy and dried-out that our dog wouldn't even eat them - and I've seen him pork down his own crap like it was Sevruga caviar. 

Look, I get that it's KFC. I'm not expecting world-class cuisine. But I do expect that my $7 chicken tenders will at least be edible. Shame on you, KFC."}
{"text":"I worked at this location back in October of 2017, It was my first job. This is not a good place to work at. Little training, just threw me out there. They have such a big turnover. The manager Angela jumps on everyone, treats the workers like sh*t. Maybe if there was a new manager, things would be better."}
{"text":"Less then 1 star.....
I work in the area and went here for lunch. Went thought the drive thru and they told me that I would need to park by the door because the chicken tenders I ordered would take 3 minutes and they would bring it out. I waited 15 minutes and just left being I was already late going back to work. Ugh customer service people just don't get it!!"}
{"text":"This is the third Kentucky Fried Chicken I have come to in every time I've asked for a pot pie and not once have I gotten one but it will be 20 minutes. The mashed potatoes and gravy R only gravy no potatoes. Really not in impressed and that was the drive ."}
{"text":"The drive through was supposed to be open but the teenagers working sure didn't want to help anyone! They turned off the light on their sign and they wouldn't help us. The sign said they were open to midnight and it was only 10:30. Don't waste your time going here."}
{"text":"3rd time; last time.  The fatty chickens aren't juicy they are gross.  They messed up my order each time. They've parked me twice. ..to make chicken. ..ughhh that's all they make. WTF.  And, the girl on drive got mad at me because she literally had a whisper baby voice on speaker. .. like #KevinHeart would say...\"say it with your chest\". 3 times; shame on me. The only reason why I even came here was because I couldn't do regular fast food but I didn't want to cook or get out of my car. Plus, speaking of comedians, I like #NormMacdonald"}
{"text":"Ya, if you are driving down the I-15 and need gas and want something to eat the KFC at the Pilot Travel Center is convenient - other than that I wouldn't eat here again (or recccomend it to others).

Firstly, the staff are a joke! They are grumpy, inattentive, and don't listen to their customers. They got my order wrong. The person behind me got the wrong things. And the person beside me was clearly communicating but the guy wasn't listening and didn't really care.  They all seem like they are all from the same family based on the bickering that was going on amongst themselves. 

The fries were soggy and cold; asked for eat in and received it packed to go; tables were dirty; garbage on the floor; 

All to say - it is clear the staff don't care about their job, the customers, or each other."}
{"text":"The food is great in my opinion and they have pretty good deals. Today I had the famous bowl (Only Wednesdays) for only $2.99. That's a really good deal because the portions are generous and satisfying. I'm not too sure why this place is rated so low. It's not bad at all. The cashier, Francis, was extremely kind. I liked her a lot. Nice cashiers are what I really observe to be honest. 

Oh! One thing I didn't like was that there wasn't any sauce packets out. Maybe because it was still early, but I would have appreciated if they were out. Haha. Other than that, KFC is bomb diggity. I will be back!"}
{"text":"When you walk into a KFC you expect that they have Chicken ready to go, right??? Well, we've been here for a half hour and still no Chicken. This has happened before. Now I recall why I stopped going to KFC."}
{"text":"Went there today. Menu is all different and hard to read from your car.  Husband got tacos, (why is KFC selling tacos?)  There was almost an ounce of meat in each one, it was a pitiful thing.  Asked for extra gravy did not get, no butter for biscuit.  Biscuit smashed in the box and flat as a pancake.  It is just not the same as it used to be."}
{"text":"Terribly painfully slow!! Plus got my order wrong totally confused staff!! Where is the manager??"}
{"text":"When the food is fresh, and they get your order right, it's good. But the last 2 times I ordered from here they forgot an item j paid for. It's not hard to get an order and 3 sides correct."}
{"text":"Fuck this place, out of almost everything, rude, employees have sub 70 IQs, food sucked, tried closing the lobby 2 hours early, don't come here."}
{"text":"Zero star all the way. I don't like kfc anymore and went vegetarian after going to this chain.  Chicken doesn't taste as good like 20 or so years ago, the management doesn't believe in good quality and even good service. I rather go to Popeyes and not waste my money to this chain."}
{"text":"It has been awhile since I've been to a KFC, so thought I would stop in for some chicken, mashed potatoes/gravy and slaw. This location is by far the cleanest I have ever been to. The staff were very pleasant and the food good. I recommend this location, if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"Fast service.  Ordered extra crispy chicken.  The food was good as usual.  Will come back again."}
{"text":"Omg this is the worst KFC ever!!!!
Someone must have mixed the original breading wrong because it tasted awful and didn't look right!
I used to get mad about the debit card fee and only go with cash and now I will not go here ever again!
You would think as a franchise there would be corporate rules and they would shut this branch down! They do not live up to the standards I expect from KFC!"}
{"text":"I like KFC, it's usually an ok place to order from. Last time I went (yesterday)the service was horrible.  Clerk at counter was rude and they didn't have enough chicken. I don't don't understand why or how that could happen. I went in the evening about 6pm so I don't know if that was why.
All I know is the staff needs to be retrained as far as customer service goes."}
{"text":"This location says they're open until 11:00pm on Sunday. The location is staffed until 11:00pm on Sunday. If you go through the drive through they will respond. 

If you want chicken before 11:00pm you are out of luck. Plan to be greeted by a voice telling you they are out of chicken and because they close in 15 minutes they won't make any more. 

Don't come here. Definitely avoid the place after 10pm. If you really want fried chicken go Popeyes where they will serve you chicken during the hours they advertiser they are open."}
{"text":"It's Sunday afternoon noon and they have no chicken tenders told me it would be a 15 minute wait. And I was told no one made unsweetened ice tea this morning.  I would avoid this Kentucky Fried Chicken at all costs"}
{"text":"This place has got soooooo horrible. I can't wait for my kids to no longer like kfc. They just charged me $1.19 for 2 cups for water for my kids. I guess they want kids to have sugat drinks and get diabetes."}
{"text":"We are here waiting for our food... I asked them about it and apparently nobody made our food and are completely unaware we are sitting at an empty table... so here we are back to waiting. 
Girl in the back is throwing out F-bombs, place is a mess. Ugh!

I have young men looking for jobs... why would a business allow this kind of service???"}
{"text":"If i could give no stars i would. Our mashed potatoes where old, dry, and seriously like Brown. The chicken was dry and stale. When i went to the counter the manager, lucil looked at me 4 times and said nothing to me. Finally i said if i satnd gere long enough i might get help. This managers excuse for the food being crappy was that it is all fresh, we made them before we opened..  Ummmm wait a minute its almost 1 pm... Shouldnt the food be just a tad bit fresher then this? Not only is this a filthy store but the manager Luco is a terrible example of a leader. The one person that deserves Kudos is Cesar. Wbat a rock star he was..."}
{"text":"I tend to not write reviews for big fast food corporations such as KFC but since this experience wasn't so pleasant heck why not. Decided to pay this place a visit after numerous ads on tv to try there Nashville Hot and Smoky BBQ chicken and chicken tenders (yes, ads do work). I wish I have never went. First start off waiting 15 mins for there fryer to reach temperature and finally going home to greasy, rarely any sauce, and most importantly semi-frozen tenders was not all appetizing. I should have double-checked my order and made sure the chicken was up to temperature. The only thing that was good to eat was the mashed potatoes and gravy. I wish the cashier informed of how the long it was going to take but instead waste the $12 I had. Side note, I did receive a cookie for waiting 15 mins but still you can't swoon me for barely cooked tenders!"}
{"text":"A few weeks back, I stopped by to pick up dinner. Everything started off right but I forgot to order hot wings. I was told it will be around 10 minutes. I had no problem with that. I came back after 10 minutes to hear they sold my order before I got there. They gave me attitude when I asked for a refund and I called corporate. I was sent a voucher for $5 off. I didn't want to come to this one but it was closest to my house. I ordered hot wings and was told it will be about 10 minutes. Do these people ever learn? I stopped at the window to pay and the manager comes up to take my voucher and spends 10 minutes looking at it. After given my receipt I was told to wait up front and I spent another 10 minutes waiting for my food. WTF!!!! I was given my food and I wasn't given an apology for the wait or a \"thank you have a nice day\". The food sucked as well as the employees."}
{"text":"Chicken was good. Staff was friendly, but! Coleslaw tasted different than other KFC resteraunts I have been to. And 24 dollars for a 10 piece meal is ridiculous! Hopefully KFC solves these issues! And maybe thinks of a special. This is a poor part of town. If I was feeding more than 2 people 10 piece meal wouldn't be enough, and would be too pricey for a bigger family!"}
{"text":"We like the special deal they have for around $5.58 for each lunch or dinner.  We get a1 nice size chicken breast, mash potatoes with roll, and cookie.  Worth the money.   Service was nice.  Could give a little more mash potatoes."}
{"text":"This is a fine example of the KFC chain. Nice enough dining room, drive thru and so on. The thing I like about this restaurant is that it has a buffet. Although popular in other parts of the country, this is the only one in the Pittsburgh area that I know of with a buffet."}
{"text":"Worst KFC ever. Went through the drive through and order three meals. The crispy chicken strips looked as thin as paper and tasted like jerky. It also had an fishy after taste. Probably  from old grease.  Don't go here. The guy at the drive through got our whole order wrong and we kept asking him to correct it. Which made him have an attitude towards us."}
{"text":"The service at this location is horrible! They state in plain site their drive thru closes at 11 pm, in the drive thru at 10 pm and the staff will not serve you a shuts the lights off an hour early on you while you are sitting in the drive thru waiting for service while you can clearly see them inside putting on their jackets and leaving!! Sides are also constantly missing from orders when they do serve you and they don't offer drinks with your meal and when you pull up to pay they then tell you a drink is not included with your meal!"}
{"text":"Lol first time  I decided to kfc for lunch, and a laughing experience,i never write a review before for bad service I just stop going. This one is special, the big guy that work there give me one dollar short on my change and didn't even ask me if I want a recipe on top of that he counting the money that he short change me and put in his pocket right in front of me. Lol may be he owner of the shack or kfc need to put camera look out for cashiers steal money from register... (* didn't want to say anything for the dollar short worry something bad in my chicken *)"}
{"text":"Wow! 7:30 open until 10:00. We're not cooking anymore extra crispy tonight. Pretty pathetic KFC"}
{"text":"This is a good location, only had 1 time where my bucket didn't have everything ( missing 1 or 2 pieces)  I still go to this location ... just wish they wouldn't take the food out early ..... food needs to be cooked a bit longer ..... seems too soft ..... and the building needs to be updated .. looks really old and kinda gross inside"}
{"text":"I had a craving so I stopped here today hoping that if I'll go in and it seems clean, I'll order.  If not, I'll leave...
It seemed clean!

So, there were managers all over the place and the girls behind the counter were:
A.)  Nice
B.)  Super quick
C.)  Very efficient


I would say, give it a try if you're in the mood for a Chicken Pot Pie with about a gazilliondy calories and a milliondy grams of fat.

There's no guarantee that, without mgmt present, it will be the same level of service, but seriously... I was rather impressed today!

PROS:
Staff was nice;
Service was quick;
Food was good;
Management was present to ensure quality control of service.

CONS:
Entrance to this location is tricky.  You almost have to make a u-turn if coming from the opposite side of the street and there's only one entrance."}
{"text":"Worst customer service! I don't know if the guy that was helping me was managment, but he decided to carry on a conversation with an off the clock employee while taking my order and got it all wrong. Went one more time a few weeks later and ordered their chicken fried steak special for $2.99. I know it's only $2.99 but the chicken tasted like it had been sitting a little too long and there was not enough gravy on both the chicken or mashed potatoes. Will never return to this location again!"}
{"text":"25 minute wait in the drive-thru!! This place is SO disorganized and short staffed. Not worth the time."}
{"text":"Their customer service has gotten a lot better. Management has changed and has done their job quite well. They get my order right every time now, as opposed to before - they'd screw it up in some way. Unfortunately like all fast food and businesses, everything has gone up in price. However, for the better service, it's worth it."}
{"text":"KFC Buffets are becoming a harder to find these days... they used to have few in Michigan and it was all removed and converted into normal KFC... so whenever I go on road trip and I have an opportunity to stop by KFC, I make sure I find one where buffet is served, in fact if time allows, I'll go out of my way to stop by to get the buffet.

For $9 per person, you get unlimited supply of fried chicken and side items, the price includes drinks.  You get your original, crispy, all the sides to your hearts desire.  Got my dark meat, coleslaw to my hearts desire.  The Mac-n-cheese served on the buffet was different then the ones they give you as side, less of quality to be honest.  

Overall, a nice place to stop by on your way to DC :)"}
{"text":"Man I don't like writing bad reviews but I hate it when I order something expecting everything to be in the bag but to find out once I'm home that certain items are missing. I ordered a go cup, chicken little and a $5 fill up 3 chicken tenders. For some reason when I was getting my drink I decided to throw away my receipt before grabbing my food. But I remember it showing their FLG sauce and cookie was included. 

I came home and the two items was not in the bag. I really wanted to try that sauce FLG sauce too cuz I don't think I had it before. Besides who eats chicken tenders without sauce?! And it's always good to have a cookie at the end of your meal! Ughhh boooo 

Only 2 stars cuz at least the cashier was nice but idk cuz she didn't put everything in my bag either so..."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. .. absolutely will not ever go back.. their customer service is terrible, I pull up through drive thru and there is a sign saying that they are not taking credit card so I asked the lady if she can direct me to the nearest atm she says no, because she doesn't know. . So I said ok, they after I go and come back with cash I ordered the family meal that comes with coleslaw and mashed potatoes she said ok pull up to the window, so I get there and she said she doesn't have enough original chicken to give me.. if I wanted crispy so at that moment I asked why she never told me that they didn't have enough why she didn't mention anything about it before.. so she gives me attitude.. so I said no I want tbe original she said ok but u gotta pull off then she would bring it out so I drive to the nearest parking spot available and I waited 23 mins for my food.. my son and daughter both under 6 yrs old were hot and were hungry... I'm very unhappy with this.. because they still had about 1 1/2 to close"}
{"text":"disgusting never eat here ever trust me my food had multiple hairs in it and i had to pick it from my teeth and they also messed up mu order"}
{"text":"I seen a lot of bad reviews on this place but I never really had any problems here except one time they filled my bucket with chicken from the back instead of the freshly made batch from the front.  I asked why and they said don't worry about it so I asked for my money back.  They were hesitant at first and I told them If they fill my bucket up with chicken from the from then i'm good...  They did so and I only come in on Tuesdays and they take the chicken from the front.  Some employees need to smile a bit more but its all good."}
{"text":"This place serve old chicken to the public....I ve been there many times and depending on the time u will get old unfresh chicken...i will be calling corporate this have happened to many times"}
{"text":"ATTENTION!! KFC SNOW ROAD! AVOID! (14901 Snow Road)

Snow Road at Smith Road

I had a coupon from the Cleveland area Entertainment Book. When I was ordering, I was told that the owner at this location had told the staff not to accept these. I thought this was extremely rude, and left without buying anything, and made sure to inform them I'd never be back. Would you mind telling me how a KFC store cannot accept a valid KFC coupon? This reflects poorly not only on this location but the entire chain, since I made a special trip to get this. I have no intention of going back at all, since I have no way of knowing which of your stores will accept this or not, as well as inform everyone I know (and possibly on Craig's List as well) about this arbitrary policy, whatever it is. I can always go to Mr. Chicken, which I like quite well and have never had a problem with. Four free pieces of chicken on what was going to be a $20+ sale cost this store a lot of bad publicity."}
{"text":"The wait was a little long, but it was around lunch time, so that was to be expected...  The sanitation grade was up to par which made me happy, but apparently I have not eaten at a KFC for a while because they don't sell the little parfait things anymore...  I have to admit, I was kind of sad about that... lol  

I picked up one of their new boneless original chicken pieces because I had all the sides already and I have to say I was a little nonplussed by it... I mean, it was okay, but that was the best I could give it... 

The workers were a bright spot, though... They worked quickly with great perky personalities to get the line moving as expeditiously as possible...  It was a little hard to make it back to my office in half an hour, but I pulled it off... Next time I'll probably go earlier than 12:00 or later than 1:30, though..."}
{"text":"I live down the steet and I have no idea why I ever give this location another chance. It's the worst KFC in vegas! I waited 5 min at the speaker and 5 in the window without even a \"hello\". Called the GM Ceaser and he was non apologetic! Drove to Windmill location and what do u know??.... Excellent service!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible. I stopped here for a quick dinner, as I had been craving fried chicken. I ordered a 3 piece meal with white meat. As you can see from the pic, the grilled piece I ordered was a 10th of the size (and gray, and dry!) of the other pieces. The coleslaw side had fermented and was absolutely foul. (no pun intended) the Mac and cheese was watery, not sure how this is even possible, and the biscuit was stale. No wonder this place was empty on at 630 in the evening. Needless to say, there are plenty if better options around. 

It's Bo Time."}
{"text":"Extremely rude mexican staff!
I clearly said wedges and the staff (many times) gave me mash potato.
They wont give enough sauce. 
If you ask for a couple more sauces, they will bargain with you."}
{"text":"Save yourself the frustration and head over to El Pollo Loco ... this place is awful. So poorly managed (see other reviews). I went into the drive thru at 2:15 PM on a Wednesday. Not a soul to be seen or heard. After waiting about 5 minutes at the speakerboard, I pulled around to the window. Saw two employees lazily talking with each other without a care in the world. Probably staffed by stoners and dropouts. Not worth the effort. El Pollo Loco much healthier anyway."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THIS KENTUCKY. We stopped by their last night (7/12/12) 8:30 PM and ordered a 10 piece and half doz bisquits. After we paid for our meal, we waited. After about 5 minutes, I asked one of the employees \"was someone working\" on our order. He goes to the back and checks and comes back and says \"oh the bisquits are another 4 minutes. I said ok and said to myself, well it would have been nice to let us know, so we waited. I just happen to be looking at the back of the kitchen and saw an employee take (6) bisquits off the tray that was in the oven, put them in a box and put them into the MICROWAVE..I WAS LIKE WTH!!!!. Sure enough those bisquits went straight to my order. I didn't say anything took the order and said thank you. In the car I checked the bisquits and they were NOT COOKED. The insides of ALL the bisquits were ALL DOUGHY!!!. I immediately took the bisquits in and the employee who did it, had this look on his face like OH SHIT!!! He \"KNOWINGLY\" new what he had done but still did it. He did NOT know how to answer and react to what he just did. The manager came up and he too didn't know how to handle the situation. Yes, I got my $$ back but FACT is and the QUESTION is, what else do they do at this location US CUSTOMERS dont know about...I WILL NEVER GO TO THIS LOCATION AGAIN!!!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give a No Star I would give it to them. The food was cold, the service sucked, ( drive thru ) personnel had big attitude as if I was inconveniencing their \"chill\" time, and they gave me attitude for speaking proper English and them not understanding it. So I will never go back to this KFC."}
{"text":"Terrible!! Lady taking our order was so rude and acted like she didn't even want to be there. The food was not good. Won't be back. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Ew, the food I got was disgusting. Ordered a breast meal. The biscuit was like a rock and the meat was so old and dry it flaked apart like fish. It looked liked they had previously cooked it and then refried it to warm it up. Old nasty overpriced food, fast food in Pittsburgh SUCKS! I'll def loose weight living here....."}
{"text":"It's always hard for me to review a fast food joint but KFC had some pretty awesome customer service the other night I went. Besides the 45 minute wait, the inability to order beforehand at the menu stand, and the long lines, our service once we arrived at the window was nothing short of wonderful, something you don't get often at fast food places. 

Their mic set wasn't working so we weren't able to order before arriving at the window causing a delay in our food service. Once we finally arrived up to the window, the man behind the counter was very friendly and apologized for the delay in service. There was two of us in the car and he offered us two large sodas for the long wait and even asked if anyone was in the back to offer more drinks for the wait. We ordered a meal for 6 so our food order was pretty large and noticed once we got home a large size of coleslaw was thrown in for us also. That's how customer service should be done!"}
{"text":"really dirtt and slow. i am writting this review as i sit here. The toilets are not clean. only lile 4 emplyees. the dining room is dirty no one has cleaned it. no ice in machine. people waiting long for food. :( come at your own risk."}
{"text":"The 5 star review is definitely for Trent, he's a newer employee and I'm praying he stays! He's the sweetest employee and definitely has an awesome personality!
He cares about his job the customers and the cleanliness of the store. He took time out of his shift to make sure we were happy and enjoying our meal.
If this managers knows anything he will keep him around, I'll be back because of him!"}
{"text":"This KFC is a joke. They never have enough chicken for any large bucket and the staff is rude and act as if you are inconveniencing them by coming to their Resturant. This spot is so close to my home so unfortunately I have put myself through the torture of going multiple times. Today I had enough. I asked to the manager and the girl at the window sarcastically said \"that was the manager taking your order\"I said \"perfect is like to speak to her.\" Because that was the rude person taking my order. Andrea then came to the window and said kind of pleasantly what do you need I asked if she was the one taking my order and she said no. Then I was confused. The young ladies in the back ground by this time were laughing at me so I chose to ask for the GM information. I'll give Antonio a call tomorrow to see if he cares about how poorly his store is ran


The above review was was mine from months ago- I never hit submit and when I Went to post a review on this very same spot I reread to see I yet had made a horrible mistake by giving it another shot. Kessandra (I think was her name as she refused to give it to me) \"we have a 20 min wait for everything\" me - okay I'll wait \"I said it's 20 min\" rudely, loud and aggressively she said it again and I said - you never asked me if I wanted to wait but I'm going to. She began to argue to which I asked her name and she wouldn't give it. She complained about being short staffed THE said she doesn't have an attitude it's just \"how I sound\" Long crazy story short I only waited 5 minutes and they gave me very old food.  This KFC and its employees are seriously a joke. Hard to believe they still are operating"}
{"text":"You know what I hate?  When drive-thru cashiers say, \"Just park up front and we'll bring it out to you.\"  I know why they do it.  But I still hate it.  And today's experience at this KFC made my detestation of said practice even stronger.

Ordered a Double Down Sandwich in the drive-thru.  I was told that it would take a few minutes because they didn't have any filets ready at the time.  And, to their credit, the order taker did ask me if an extra few minutes would be okay.  I affirmed and then proceeded to the window,

After paying, the cashier told me to park up front.  Grrr, argh.  I ruefully did so.  After NEARLY 15 MINUTES of waiting \"up front,\" I decided to walk my hungry self into the restaurant.  They'd forgotten about me!

At any rate, I watched them make my sandwich, took it to my car, ate it, and then immediately crafted this review.  Wasn't surprised to see the low ratings given by others."}
{"text":"Make sure your shoes are tied tightly or they may get pulled off from the super sticky floors!   Dining room isn't family of 5 friendly. Staff was friendly and the food was hot. They have a sanitation score of 96.5 though. All in all I guess we would come back eventually"}
{"text":"Employees are really friendly.  Too bad the chicken doesn't taste like your average KFC...a little dry, hard, & tough. I'll give 'em another chance my next visit to LV. Until then I'll stick to Cane's or look for a Popeyes in Vegas."}
{"text":"I am addicted to KFC's bowl (minus the gravy).  And their biscuits.  YUMMY!!!

However, the reason that I am giving them 3 stars instead of more is because every time, and I am literally not kidding here, EVERY time I go through their drive thru, they mess up the order.  Either they put the gravy on the bowl, or the cookie is missing, or they don't give me one of the biscuits, or they entirely forget to give me my drink, or they charge me wrong... EVERY TIME!!"}
{"text":"Every now and then I just have to get my fix of KFC chicken in either the delicious regular or extra crispy varieties which I still prefer.

Today was the day for doing so since I had a handy-dandy $9.99 coupon for a 6-piece meal for two in hand.

I have never been to this particular KFC location before, although I have driven by many times in the past. 

The service and wait time were more than reasonable and I got an unexpected bonus when they ran out of the single-serve side dishes ( mashed potatoes and coleslaw) for my order and ended up giving me a free upgrade to the larger containers. 

No what's not to like about extra food at no charge? I was a smiling happy camper as I left with my to-go order."}
{"text":"This is one of the more conveniently located KFC restaurants in my neck of the woods. I usually only come here when there is a coupon or discount of some sort available since I rarely like paying full price for fast-food items especially here in the land of endless two-for-one offers (a.k.a. Las Vegas, Nevada).

A CVS Pharmacy is located right next door for your medicinal needs and a Smith's supermarket is right across the street. If you want to shop more efficiently and combine several stops on one trip, then this corner location is a good spot for doing so.

As far as the chicken served here is concerned, I have never been disappointed with any of my to-go orders so far. Service is invariably very quick and I am usually out the door posthaste with my delectable fried chicken goodies safely in hand."}
{"text":"This is the KFC that I usually visit when craving my Crispy Colonel fix.

There used to be a problem a few years ago at this specific location with the food occasionally being too salty, but they have thankfully gotten over their excessive use of NaCl since then. The service itself is usually pretty quick, no long waits here.

Extra crispy or the original recipe is usually the way I roll when coming here. The newer barbecue recipe simply does nothing for me; it appears to be little more than extra crispy chicken with barbecue sauce slathered on.

It's always worth being patient until those inevitable KFC discount coupons show up in the local newspaper to ensure that you get that extra special, extra crispy deal. 

Happily, $5.00 specials now appear to be a regular offering - no coupons needed!

When you stop on by, tell them the Crispy Colonel sent you and see just how extra crispy things can get ;-)"}
{"text":"Is zero stars allow the chicken taste like crap they charge me for ranch and using 
My card don't eat here"}
{"text":"When we pulled up to the drive through the guy working the mic was blowing and whistling into the mic. When I got up to the window i said hello and asked how she was doing ,to the lady , who's name is Tiff, that was standing there. She looked me straight in the eyes and completely ignored what I said to her then pushed the window open and blurred out my total. After I handed her my money, she went back to having a conversation with the young man on the mic and told him to hurry up and go make our food. 

Overall terrible customer service and it's always been that way at this location. There is maybe 2 good employees that work here."}
{"text":"Just this previous week my brother (my newly acquired room mate) and I sat loathsomely about the house pondering what to do with the night and although they do make rubber pants our size we couldn't think of a retailer that would be open at that hour. Anyways we decided to take a stroll to the local purveyor of fine spirits (LCBO) and discuss what meal to eat along the way.
Once on Queen St what we saw would shock and excite us to our darkest dirty pleasure that was born in the rumors of strange arrangement of a meal that was only to be born State side of the border. In the window of the KFC was nothing more than an advertisement promising that which is most sinful, The Double Down. I pulled off and cleaned my monocle, which came off more of me punching my brother in the arm and yelling \"holy shit let's eat one!\".
I entered the grease shack, that smelt of unclean fryer and mechanically separated animals of many flavours. The decor here is lacking as is any sort of seating. None the less I approached the lovely lady behind the counter and demanded that she fulfill that which is promised in the window, she looked at me like a dog when you talk to it, mouth slightly ajar twisting her head slowly to the right. Figuring we had failure to communicate do to my excited state I said it in plain English \"Two double downs my good lady\" she said \"ok\" and then the person in the back yelled out \"DOUBLE DOWN SIX MINUTE\". 
In order to take our minds off this terrible food injustice of waiting my brother and I continued out journey to the LCBO (which just as a side note I like pronouncing Lic-Bo) where we go not but the finest of spirits (read: cheap rum and a bunch of cider, guiness and a bottle something called french kiss), once purchased we practically ran back to the house of sin and again demanded that our promises be fulfilled. This time I was handed a greasy paper bag and sent on my marry way. Once home the double downs were served out plated in a paper bag inside a cardboard box and no garnish what so ever. I took a bite in to my greasy marriage of 2 pieces of breaded and deep fried chicken, microwave bacon, processed cheese and what tastes to be ranch salad dressing, and it was OK at best. My dreams were let down and not gently NAY, crashed to the ground like a nodded out heroin addict. It was salty and greasy and something that I think can only be described and being raped in the mouth by a dirty or farmer. My brother seemed to agree though he ate his with a knife and fork which leads me to believe he is actually my sister. Upon completion of this crime against nature a feeling of general malaise swept over me.

All in all this is like eating a sandwich made of sad... it will hurt your feelings, I was forced to get hammered in order to forget the whole ordeal, yet I still can't wash away the shame."}
{"text":"This has to be the most disappointing KFC I've ordered from.
They cut regular pieces in half and count it as a piece.
Popeyes and Chick n Joy are better quality options.
Never again from this location."}
{"text":"Y'all fucking suck, customer service sucks ass. Y'all really need to hire some new people, that fat Ass manger was standing behind the chicken lmao and was looking at me thru the hole WEIRDO couldn't even talk to me. Ugly ass. Close this mf down cause this place sucks. Not even the food but the workers smh"}
{"text":"This kfc always, always shorts you on take out. 

If you have large take out orders they always seem to miss your items. And hope you don't notice it. 

Ordered 8 tonnie specials for coworkers at lunch. When i went back to the office, a 2 pc and fries order had only 1 piece. This also happened with a bucket order the month before."}
{"text":"This place is not good. They never have tenders after 8 PM. Four times that I've been there and they don't have tenders. I don't know how apparantly 2 hrs before closing they run our if tenders. They should make sure to be able to have food before closing."}
{"text":"Ok. I literally just left this place of business.  Who close at 10pm and it's 9:28pm. Only to be told they don't have any chicken. Thank God I'm  vegan now. However this is my 2nd time coming to KFC. The one in Palmdale n this one. Only to be told they dont have any chicken.  If you're out of chicken then close the store for business.  People's primary reason for coming to your establishment is for chicken! !!"}
{"text":"The Girl Needed some KFC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lol 

We \"needed\" the new broasted product. we ordered the 10 pc. bucket meal,1/2 fried and 1/2 broasted. ( True story) . 

We Got SIX broasted wings...lol...called the store and no answer,,,,, 

Drove back and replaced for the assorted mix,,,rude manager, 

out"}
{"text":"The reviews weren't good but it was only in reference to the wait time so I prepared myself for the wait. It took 10min but the chicken was fresh and worth the wait!!! The same add were very friendly as well. They also warned me of the wait so that s a plus as well."}
{"text":"This store is ridiculous. Whoever is managing this store needs to retrain it's employees. They were completely rude. Gia Brown was in the back making sex noises and scream loudly the entire time and Karla (the manager) did absolutely nothing. They screwed up our order and I requested out money back and Karla refused to speak to me saying she was too busy. They were out of biscuits, mac and cheese, potato wedges, and bbq sauce all of which I ordered. Do not eat here. I will be sending a complaint and video of Gia making sex noises to corporate office. FIRE EVERYONE!!! Lucky I didn't go back there and kick everyone's ass"}
{"text":"We stopped in afyter a long drive on the way home. We ordered a big basket which says 6 piece tender, 4 piece chicken. When we got the order there was 6 tenders but didn't have the 4 pieces of chicken. When I asked, they said ity is either or. Dont recall being asked which I want. 

When I spoke with the manager, she had a bad attitude. She let me change it, and immediately threw the chicken fingers in the trash. Needless to say I was overall dissatisfied with the service.

I give two starts instead of one because the dining area is pretty clean compared to other KFC restaurants."}
{"text":"its 12 noon and this place does not have ec breast and wings ready.  its lunch time people.   hello.   chicken is all you do. or on this case do not."}
{"text":"Just ordered our food and came home to eat it. The rice in the power bowls was hard and old, felt like I could break my tooth on it. Lettuce was old and wilted. Black beans were stuck together, dried up and seemed like they scraped the bottom of the pot. It was simply not edible!!!! Worst food I've ever had. This place needs an adult to supervise the quality of what goes out the door."}
{"text":"I received my food in a timely fashion after paying.  Our food was hot and fresh. I received what I ordered with no mistakes, so that's always a plus.

I knocked two stars off because of the prices (high!) and because the service just average; nothing overwhelmingly awesome."}
{"text":"KFC is a guilty pleasure I enjoy from time to time, and a coworker had a coupon for a discount on their new boneless chicken so we decided to go try it out.

When we handed the coupon to the cashier, the store manager who was in the back told her not to honor it. I asked why not, and the store manager got an attitude and declared that his franchise chooses not to honor most coupons and that, actually, they don't have to honor any coupons at all. I have to admit, I was pretty impressed by his off-putting and dismissive attitude towards a customer! When I asked what KFCs here aren't run by his franchise, he smirked and said, \"We run all the KFCs in Nevada and Arizona, so you don't have a choice\".

Look, I respect individual franchisees' decisions to assess their economic situations independently and not take certain coupons. But if they do that, they should be respectful to their customers and simply apologize - not be smug and condescending. And anyway, the store manager was wrong - I do have a choice, and that's not to patronize KFC whenever I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Was given an incorrect order at drive-through and called the store when I found out after getting back to the office. The manager didn't even apologize, then after asking what was wrong with my order, blew me off using the reasoning that what I was given was more expensive than what I ordered. Even ignoring the absurdity of her excuse, the difference was literally ~20cents. Apparently I should be rejoicing that instead of getting what I wanted, I got something priced at 20 cents more!

Honestly, I'd have been happy with just an apology that sounded even remotely sincere - but instead staff here went out of their way to show they don't care about the customers at all."}
{"text":"It was my mistake not looking at Yelp before we came to this restaurant. There were four of us and we all ordered the same meal the $5 fill up box 3 piece chicken tenders. About the only thing good I have to say is that all the KFC's they had the largest small mashed potatoes and gravy I've ever seen and it was great. Unfortunately the chicken was dry and looked weird. It didn't taste like it was original or crispy it was just dry and tasteless. The other two people I was with basically said. \"meh\" and the fourth person in our group was also not impressed."}
{"text":"The guy at the counter was kind and awkwardly flirtatious in an 1800's way. He interrupted my fiancé  several times to continue his charm. I am not flattering myself in any way I just think it was his personality. Aside from that, the location feels like it needs a full sanitation. It was maintained ok but it feels like frying oil sits heavy in the air. Orders were not served as ordered and their drink machine has a refrigeration problems and is not making ice. The food was not fresh. Everything was a bit chewey with an oil taste. Too tired to send it back we just picked at it. The employees were kind and that is why I gave 2 stars. Overall, KFC as a company feels irrelevant and the quality and value in the last 20 years feels like it is unconceivably in decline from you last visit. Popeyes is a better choice when making the bad choice of eating fried chicken. 
Regret eating here, KFC may be how bulimia became an eating disorder. A pun in poor taste.
I forgot to mention that it smelled like vomit in the kitchen area, I made the mistake of lingering too long at the front counter to put a lid on my drink."}
{"text":"Ordered some chicken littles, yes the chicken was delicious but the bread was rock hard (from stale bread not even toasted!!) Good thing I got a drink, even though I threw half of the bread away! Don't think I'll be trying them again!"}
{"text":"This KFC was the worst I have ever been to in my 66 years of life.The chicken was so hard and dried out I could not even bite into it or pull any off it was more dried out seriously than dried beef jerky.The tables were dirty and sticky and the bathroom was horribly nasty.The workers were more interested in running outside ,talking to friends at the drive up, or going in the back than waiting on paying customers.We waited for almost fifteen minutes as they walked by and looked at us at times.I am not mad I just feel if you pay for food by golly you should be able to eat it the biscuit was ok that was my supper.Someone needs to supervive these workers better.We were there around 6pm on easter we were not the only people who could not eat their food and it went into the garbage.Complain to them you say??I went up there three times my husband twice they would not come out of hiding after us even saying we need some help here pretty loud just laughing.This was our first and last time at this KFC.I never ask for our money back either lesson learned."}
{"text":"The drive-thru here was surprisingly fast. The letdown here for me though is that they closed the Taco Bell next door and when they reno'd this store they didn't do a combo store.

I tried the All Star promo box meal. The fries and chicken sandwich were really fresh. Nice and hot. Unfortunately the two pieces of chicken that come with the meal were not. The breading was starting to show signs of getting soggy."}
{"text":"This little unsuspecting KFC/Taco Bell has been updated on the inside. The interior is newer and the place is clean and well maintained. 

I've never had to wait an exorbitant amount of time here like I usually find at most KFC's."}
{"text":"I do not like this KFC ...or any really for that matter. Every time I have been here the place is filthy. I know they remolded the place and I have not been since then, so I am not sure if the conditions are the same.

The food is just not good in any way anymore. Not that it was ever great, but you could get some decent chicken and some sides and be content. What the hell have they done to the mac & cheese? It is so gross..the color is just not appealing and the taste is worse. Food at this place has been served under temperature enough times to keep me from returning."}
{"text":"This store is AWFUL!!!! Me and my husband went there on Saturday 7/29/17. The girl at the counter did not ask if it was for here or to go, just automatically packed it as to go. So we took it home. The fries were dried out and chewy, the zinger sandwich was not spicy and stale as well. The only fresh thing in the $5 box was the cookie. I now remember why I have not been to a KFC in years and it will be many more before I go again"}
{"text":"When I arrived at KFC there was only one visible employee. She was working the drive-thru. She took 3 minutes to come take my order.  I inquired about the 5 buck fill up deal, and began to order this. I discovered that you can not swap the mashed potatoes for cole slaw. Since I find the mashed potatoes at KFC to be appalling, I decided to change my order. This obviously upset the woman taking my order, which I determined when she (tried to hide the fact that she) rolled her eyes (eyelid flutters) and tensed her mouth. I proceeded to order a two piece meal, medium with coleslaw. It comes with a biscuit. I got the extra crispy, because they did not have any grilled white meat. The food came quickly, before I even finished filling my fountain drink. This was a nice surprise!  And the chicken smelled great!  I ate the biscuit first, since I like them warm. It was hard as a rock on the outside and crumbly on the inside. I was hoping for a nice buttery outside and a fluffy inside. This biscuit was probably old. I then ate the coleslaw, since it is one of my favorite KFC foods!  Yum!  It was perfect. And the portion cup was jam packed!  Just the way I like it!  Lol. Now for the chicken. First I ate the wing. It was a little dry, and mostly breading. This is hard to avoid as it is a small piece of meat. So I didn't mind. However, as I began eating the breast, I immediately discovered that the crispy was only on the outside!!  Under that top layer was a huge under layer of soggy, under cooked, disgusting breading!  Yuck!  I had to scrape most of the breading off, as it was quite gross. The chicken underneath was moist generally, but there was a tough part on the one end that was so hard to chew, and very dry, it was worse that trying to bite beef jerky!  Not exaggerating!  I finished my meal the best I could and then used the restroom. It was surprisingly clean and smelled fresh!  You don't see that often in a fast food setting. Kudos for that!  However, since I don't go to KFC to admire the bathrooms, since it is all about the food, I can't give this place more than 2 stars. I don't know what's happening with KFC lately; I have not had a good experience there for a long time. I suppose I will stop trying."}
{"text":"I went through the drive-through at KFC, I ordered a signature combo white piece grilled with potato wedges for the side and a medium Pepsi. The Pepsi and the side came with the signature combo at no extra charge. The total cost was $6.99 before taxes. The gentleman who took my order was pleasant.  When he repeated my order, it was correct. When I got to the window to pay for my order, the total was just shy of $10. I knew they must have miscalculated my order. I informed Kayla, the cashier at the window, that there was an error. After speaking with her manager, she proceeded to give me an additional $.41 in change, claiming that made up the difference. However, she handed me a receipt for the mistaken order. When I pointed that out, she said \"yeah, I know that, but I gave you the difference.\" I asked her for a receipt that reflected my actual purchase. She appeared very angry at my request, and called her manager again. At this point there was one person behind me in the line. After speaking with her manager again, she said she would not give me a new receipt reflecting my actual purchase and correct change. So I asked for a refund. I do not like to be screwed over, or short changed. Her response to my request was, and I quote, \"oh my God!\". She proceeded to slam the drive-through window shot, I could hear her arguing with her manager, complaining to him about me, the customer. After about three more minutes, she finally gave me my money back and I handed her back the bogus receipt and the change. The meal she attempted to charge me for was two whole dollars more, and therefore I should have received more change. I did not feel I was being unreasonable.   Perhaps to some two dollars is not a big deal, but I do not like to be overcharged and I am a cheapskate. I ordered the smaller meal specifically for the price. I do not appreciate Kayla's customer service skills, her attitude and unprofessionalism. How hard is it to delete a prior order, and fix the order? Not hard at all, I worked here when I was 16. It's a piece of cake. I do not understand her refusal to do such a simple thing. A receipt should show an accurate transaction. Anyway, I guess I am done ranting. I do not recommend this restaurant, this is not the first time I have had a bad experience.  Lesson learned."}
{"text":"The drive thru attendant was exceptional. He was friendly, helpful, quick. Excellent, excellent, excellent service. and food was great as usual. Wish I got the drive thru attendant's name. I came through July 16th at about 630-7pm"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre as was expected, however after eating and getting a refill of my drink I found that my cup was full of ants. Never eating here again."}
{"text":"Well I had a big $60 order and the manager kept the receipt so I thought it would be right. When my destination was 30 mins away I couldn't go back. They forgot my kids caprisuns and a side order of Mac and cheese. My husband went back and she was rude gave us a different side on purpose and wouldn't refill my drink since my kids had to drink it because theirs were missing. I'm not going back to this location."}
{"text":"If you go drive through they take at least 10 minutes waiting in line drive through And another 10 minutes go give you your food when you pull up to the window. The drinks are so full
Of ice and the cup is always dirty with soda spilled all over the lids. When you are about to pay the cashiers are always so rude. This is the KFC on 75th Ave and lower buckeye. Not to mention the inside is always so dirty. Floors are always full or food crumbs and napkins. Tables so dirty. This place needs a new management ASAP."}
{"text":"We sat in drive thru for half an hour and this isn't the first time. Each time we go there (which is very rare anymore) it's a crazy wait. And normally the employees are extremely rude but at least this time cashier apologized for the excessive wait."}
{"text":"The rating for this place are probably horrible because of the service because the food comes out quick and is good. I get its fast food but people should be semi nice"}
{"text":"Very disappointed more and more with kfc. Took a 4 PIECES combo and what I got was tiny mini pieces.
What we know as a piece of kfc where you get the bones and the meat, mine was cut into 2. I find that very dishonest to be selling pieces like that for the same price as the regular \"normal size pieces\" that we know.
Taste wasn't that great either just salty chicken. 
Wings were superrr tiny. I wonder if they are now using baby chicks for the wings instead
Check the pictures you can see the pieces of these kfc.
To be honest popeyes is so much more better than KFC in regards of their taste their size of the chicken the prices.
Kfc is going down for sure"}
{"text":"Ok I wouldn't write a review on good fast food for the food, so with that said the girl that handle my order at the counter couldn't have been more pleasant and helpful. I always appreciate good service, the owner should be proud of such help. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"This KFC is also a Taco Bell. 
The people who work here are beyond incompetent! 
I waited in the drive thru line for 30 minutes today with only one vehicle in front of me. Clearly that individual made a large order, but instead of telling him to pull over until they bring it out to him, they just left him there holding up the line. 
Every time I come here they get the order wrong. They also HATE when you ask for more than 2 packets of hot sauce. 
The last time i got a poutine here there was soooo many cheese curds and hardly any gravy. 
Its sad that theres so few Taco Bells out there.... i guess thats why people keep coming to this one. 
Really bad location with horrible staff. 
I do not recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Every time I come here this place is like a ghost town. It's probably me, one person waiting on their order and maybe a couple or family seated. I typically come after work on a Thursday, around 6-6:30pmish.

The staff is super friendly and always ready to help you. It's probably because there's no one in there! I'm not complaining though because it usually means I am in and out in about 10 minutes. Never a long waiting time, which is good when you're tired from work and you just want to come home and have dinner.

The place seems pretty well kept up and neat. I haven't been in here once when it appears unkept. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"How is this place still open???  I just had a miserable experience with this location last night that I don't even want to go into the details and type the whole story.  I don't need to tell what happened.  The whole story is in the comments that are on this page already from all the other people.  That is all true!!!  The manager here needs to be fired and if it were up to me, I'd clean house with the rest of the staff too!  Terrible place.  Lazy, Dirty, Rude, Uncaring, I could go on and on!   I'm taking my issue up with corporate so I can get my money's worth."}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give this place a single star, if I could. We went there at 7:45pm, pulled up and were asked to be patient as it would be a minute. After waiting 10 minutes, we ordered a 16 piece extra crispy family meal. He replied, \"hold on, I will have to check my chicken supply.\" We were a little set back being it was still 2 hours before closing time. He returned and said that it would be fine. Okay... so we continued, hesitantly, and said we would also need an 8 piece chicken only with that. \"Hold on...\" he said. He returned and said, \"Would it be okay if it was original crust?\" At this point we said no and left. No, I don't want the scraps in your bin. I don't want to know that you're too lazy to fry up fresh chicken. I won't go back."}
{"text":"So after a LONG DAY my parents go grab some carry out from KFC on Indian School.
As you see the chicken  is not cooked .
My mom called .
There was no supervisor on duty to speak to 
No one offered a refund , no meal replacement.
No apologies for the under cooked food .
This is unacceptable period..
You establishment should have been shut down many years ago .!!!"}
{"text":"They are awful with time and have terrible costumer service. While in the drive thru one employee was on the phone with her boss and just walked away from the window while the other workers just stood there. What caused us to pull up to the window in the first place was because after someone was going to take our order they just stopped talking all together. I do not recommend this KFC at all"}
{"text":"Wow...
Me- can I order a meal with original chicken
Them- we're gonna have to make it...it's a ten minute wait.
Me- okay that's fine...btw it's 730 pm like 3 hours till closing.
Them- really? You want to wait...okay...
Me- okay? Should I not?
Them- it's fine
Seriously, what in the world just happened? It's fine? I know it's just a fast food place but really?"}
{"text":"Food is good but every single time I stop there to order pot pies, they always only seem to have 1 left....Frustrating!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Decent food (not the best KFC i've had, but far from the worst), decent enough service, and a fairly clean restaurant. I've been to better KFCs, but this one is pretty good."}
{"text":"Pretty good KFC. Haven't had any problems there the times I have gone. The place seems relatively clean and the service isn't too bad. No complaints at this KFC location from me."}
{"text":"lets see....

they must have a slimmed down menu at this location. 

i wanted popcorn chicken and it wasnt on the menu. i had to settle for 5 hot wings, potato wedges and a soda for 5.00. i maybe had 5 wedges total in the box. and the wings were overcooked and not very flavorful. 

i was disappointed and I feel ripped off. i should have went to mcdonalds next door"}
{"text":"Instead of giving me what I ordered, the guy behind the counter gave me a combo including more chicken tenders than I asked for. He also informed me that they were out of BBQ sauce. Plus, their soda fountain was all kinds of messed up. Not cool."}
{"text":"I like this KFC. I've been here a few times. The food is good. Always ready fast and without any mistakes. Nice employees. Clean restaurant. On my most recent visit here, I had the value box combo meal and it was awesome! It came with chicken strips, come slaw, mashed potatoes (with gravy), a biscuit, a fountain drink, and a cookie. If you're in South Phoenix and have a cravin' for some of the old Colonel's recipe, thus place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"It was a hot humid day, I decided to grab a drink here. I decided to use their restroom... please don't, the washroom was disgustingly dirty. Embarrassingly, I was locked inside the washroom... because the door handle was broken. It would turn, but the latch wouldn't undo. I called for help, I banged on the door, no one came for my aid. Finally, when I eventually bust my way out. It turns out... there was an employee right outside the entire time, in the closet next to it, not even a meter away just cleaning. I mean, excuse you, it wouldn't hurt you to open the door for me and or call for help."}
{"text":"Corporate,  are you listening??  Although I admit, I love your product, what the hell is going on in this store? 
While I was waiting (26 minutes) for my order for two, THREE different customers came back in to say their order was wrong or incomplete.  Laura, your counter lady, handled it as best she could (2 stars are for her only)   I believe all the orders originally were through the drive thru. I have been to this store many times and have only gotten lucky to have a good experience two or three times. 
I refuse to go to the drive thru anymore, the order is either wrong or the chicken is extremely small. At 5 in the evening, you should not be out of ANYTHING, especially your most popular chicken choices. 

This location is run worse than the VA. Heads must roll; it's the only way to get right with us. 

Ps. Please keep Laura. She's full of personality and quick."}
{"text":"do not waste your time or money going to this disgusting establishment they will really screw up your order and get a major attitude with you when you bring it to their attention. there is a Bojangles two driveways down and a Zaxby's 3 minutes away, you will be much better off going to either one of those restaurants if you're in the mood for good chicken and polite service."}
{"text":"Went to this location today and ordered one of the fill up boxes and got plastic inside my chicken! I am so disgusted and will never return to this location. Small strands of plastic cooked into my meat like the edge of a bag."}
{"text":"We don't even go here anymore.   Every time they don't have enough chicken and we have to wait for them to cook it for 20
Minutes.   Bummer because I really like the ol original recipe!!"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious chicken. One of the cleanest and organized KFC that I have seen. The staff were so friendly. Oscar and Aymir thank you as well. Great job. I went in and sat for 30 minutes. Excellent meal and very pleasant environment. Would recommend highly if craving KFC."}
{"text":"Haven't been to KFC in a long time so I'm wondering if the Colonel drastically changed his recipe for the breading. The batch we got were so salty. Thankfully, it was just the breading so it was still edible but the chicken were over cooked too. My kiddo loved their mashed potatoes though.

I do appreciate that the staff were nice and very helpful."}
{"text":"Ordered big crunch and poutine, get home it was a original and heavily watered gravy. Disgusting, rip off!!! Stay away!"}
{"text":"Was in the drive up and was stuck behind someones friend who worked there. He got his food and continued to have a casual conversation while I was behind him the whole time. Ridiculous. The employee could have said to catch up later so she could do her job but instead, preferred to have a conversation with her buddy. If you wanna talk with your friend, don't do it when you're suppose to be working. Especially if you have other people waiting."}
{"text":"Should I make dinner? Order Chinese take-out?  Or get some KFC?

KFC!

Family meals start at $12.99 so I picked this combo.  

I got a bucket of original recipe chicken it came with six huge pieces, 

three yummy warm flaky biscuits with honey, 

creamy whipped potatoes and gravy 

and... I added a little side of their fabulous creamy cole-slaw.  

No cooking on a Friday night for me honey!  

Service was friendly and order was made lickity-split!  

MMMM finger lick in' good!   I'll be back:)"}
{"text":"They are always out of sides.  Not every single side is gone but it's always one or the other.  Last time it was the corn, so even if I wanted the bowl combo the corner wouldn't be on it.  Another time it was the green beans.  Some times at night the mac and cheese looked like it has been sitting out so I don't even eat it.  

Even though I prefer the other chicken places around town this KFC is on the way for me to the I-15 on Sahara.  Some times homeless would come in and chill, but because they're out of sides I can't even be nice and offer them my missing side."}
{"text":"This is my favorite KFC!! The food is always hot and always fresh. They have a friendly crew working there that take special care of me when I order. I highly recommend this location for your chicken needs."}
{"text":"This was one of those nights when we just didn't have time to make dinner so we opted for the lazy way out and hit the drive-thru. Given that it was just before midnight, we tried to remain optimistic about what might be left in stock. One of the two \"Famous Bowls\" seemed more like the washed up, haggard version of famous, given that the bowl was barely half full. The remainder of our order wasn't horrible, but it wasn't fabulous either. On the bright side, the employee at the window was very good! He was friendly and speedy!"}
{"text":"Recently visited for takeaway dinner for my parents. The cashier was very nice. Stopped her clean up efforts right away when she saw me come in. I told her what I wanted and she took care of figuring out how the order should be keyed in. Bummer was that they didn't have any drumsticks. Not in any of the recipes. Granted it was 30 minutes before they were supposed to close. So I got thighs instead. You would think that they would give you an extra something since they didn't have what you really wanted. But no. :-(  Otherwise the order was fulfilled properly and my parents liked their food. Didn't even have to ask for honey. The cashier asked if I wanted any butter, honey, or sauce."}
{"text":"Went and got the $5 box of tenders.  I wouldn't exactly call them tenders, they were more like tidbits.  Hardly any chicken and severely over cooked.  Very disappointed... Took pictures to send to corporate."}
{"text":"Food was ok but they forgot my cookie in the 5 fill up...no big deal. What was bad was getting panhandled inside of the restaurant. It gives a really bad and scary feeling...time to clean it up kfc!!"}
{"text":"We no longer have KFC in Flagstaff. So we stopped off to grab a bite before heading back home to Flag. The cashier was a space case. I ordered the #12 and did not receive my drink, or my popcorn chicken. Just my tenders. She said there wasn't a drink included. The sign clearly states it comes with a medium drink. I think she was new. And my boyfriend ordered a large potatoes wedge, he did not get it until I went up to the counter and mentioned it to them. I was a little tired of walking back and forth. We were just trying to eat and get on the road. The gentleman who helped me was very nice. I noticed the two guys behind me, they were trying to order but they were out of certain items and could tell they were frustrated. It was ok."}
{"text":"The last three times I've gone they tell me they are out of tenders or the fryer is not turned on and it'll be 10-15 minutes before it is on.  Place is one of the least reliable places I've ever been too."}
{"text":"I had a perfect drive thru experience that a review was worthy. The lady was nice and cheerful. She took my order with no problem. The chicken was warm, crispy, and just right. The people there had such a great attitude that they made my day. Will definitely be coming here again soon."}
{"text":"Dined in. Pretty clean floor needed sweeping. Bathroom was ok. I wanted 4 original wings they had to substitute 2 crispy wings because they had no more original. One of the original wings was so small it look like it was just the tip. Crispy was too crispy. They only gave us 3 ketchup packs for 3 orders of taters. The potpie has no crust on the sides or the bottom, and not enough chicken in it, but it was hot and tasty. The lady that took the order was friendly and polite, she got the order of 4 correct."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Went through the drive-thru this evening. Ordered a meal for my kids, was told I couldn't substitute a side, so i told the order taker i would order a different meal. As I proceeded to order she said \"would you just hold on a minute\", i said \"absolutely,  better yet i will just go somewhere else\" so i backed out of the drive-thru and headed to Canes....their food is better anyway."}
{"text":"Thank you, KFC, for saving me a thousand calories by not eating your food. I pulled up to your drive thru at 10 p.m. craving for something fattening and wondering what the hold up was three cars ahead. After 10 minutes of wasting my time, your employee told me that you only had grilled chicken, no fried chicken, and that if I wanted fried chicken it would be a 22 minute wait. Saw a lot of angry customers up front and wondered why you guys couldn't cook the chicken 10 minutes ago when I was in line. Get your act together, KFC! If you want to sell only grilled chicken then turn your franchise over to El Pollo Loco!"}
{"text":"waiting for my food horrible service , very rude cashier , i believe her name was diamond , shes busy on the phone while i am ordering my food , very rude terrible service and the food tasted like shit"}
{"text":"Horrible drive thru service. Tried to pick up food for my co-workers and they told me I could only make two separate orders. I asked if I could drive thru a separate time and the lady was very rude and told me they don't allow that!! Really?!?"}
{"text":"I recently went to KFC and I got some nice crispy chicken. I went in the front counter to order and Daysia was very nice and brought me my food and I almost forgot my honey and butter and she already put it in the bag. I will be coming back again."}
{"text":"The staff here is polite but they never have chicken. Every time I come here I get a list of what they don't have. Right now I'm waiting because they don't have biscuits. This restaurant needs to have better planning to do they can actually sell the items that are on the menu."}
{"text":"I know I should have known better. I should have yelped this place ahhhhhh! We were in a hurry and went through the drive through. I won't make that mistake again. Greasy mess and they didn't even get the order right. Kentucky Fried Chicken we do chicken wrong!"}
{"text":"Best service I've gotten at any recent fast food restaurant lately. Chicken was hot and fresh.  No issues at all. Asked me if I needed anything."}
{"text":"2 stars just because the sandwich was good and the guy who took our order was friendly. Other than that, this was a very bad first experience at this KFC. We ordered 2 grilled chicken sandwiches and got original fried instead. As we went back to let them know, the girl (who was also the manager) gave us a very bad sour attitude and didn't even apologize for the mix up. Then she came back with the new order and again we even thanked her and she just gave us a look and didn't say anything. Also, she took the old order and sold it to the next person at the drive thru.The same order that we had opened up and touched a second ago!!!"}
{"text":"I work in Solon, and live 30 minutes away. My work schedule starts very early in the morning so by the time i leave its around 2. This is one of the only places on my way to the highway and I stopped in today and it was disappointing. Ive had bad service here before but this takes the cake, I was the only vehicle in the drive thru and I was going to order a few things. Jonita comes on the intercom and does the usual speal. I was going to order the K6 and one other thing. Before I could even finish saying the first part of my order, she interrupts me and says, \"what do you want to drink\". I told her large coke. Before I could even say the next part of my order, she says \"5.31, pull up\". Needless to say that is less than good customer service. This place has a habit of having employees that either don't care or are impatient with customers. I have worked in the customer service industry for the better part of 15 years and this in inexcusable. Granted working in fast food isn't the most glorious of jobs but its a job. My coworkers have been here before and have experienced the same issues. I don't think ill be coming back. This place either needs to do some more training with their employees or find ones that actually care."}
{"text":"Get your hours correct. It's inconvenient for the hours to say one thing and drive all the way there and it closes a whole hour early."}
{"text":"Waited forever in drive thru to finally get my order that was wrong. I could here the employees inside complaining about the lines and really didn't want to be at work. Once home the sides were cold and coleslaw tasted spoiled. Will NOT return"}
{"text":"After being turned away at the Eastern location (\"no chicken\" at 6p), I went to Silverado. Friendly service, fast drive-thru, and chicken :) Well, I had to wait 4 minutes for breasts, but better than 20 minutes for any...?"}
{"text":"No chicken on a Friday night at 6p... \"Do you want to wait 20 minutes?\" Uh...no... I'll go to Silverado 8 minutes away."}
{"text":"Ok, well that was a hot mess!  So, there were only 4 cars but it took forever...  
Our turn at the drive thru 
\"I'll take 2 popcorn chicken\". 
\"There is no popcorn chicken the rest of the night.\"  
\"Ok, I'll need a second to rethink our order\"...kids agree on chicken tenders, \"ok, we're ready- we'll take two chicken tender combos boxes with root beer\" 
\"we are out of Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, and root beer \".  Really?!...Ok...\"well do you have the water?\"
\"  Yes.\"
 \"Ok 2 waters, please\" 
up at the window (20 minutes later?!) I am given 2 cups of ice water...\"excuse me, is there a reason we didn't get the dysani? \"
\"Oh, you wanted bottled water?  Yes, we got the combo...so I paid for a drink. 
Do you want a soda? 
No?
\"We are out of bottled water \" 
but I specifically asked you about it? 
I just heard you ask about water, not bottled water...
Obviously if I ask \" if you have the water\" I'm not asking like I think the plumbing is broken?!?
Am I being punked?
Then someone magically dug out 2 bottles of Aquafina \"from the back\"
Geez!
Food was good, served it purpose, what you'd expect, and hot but untimely- even for a Friday night drive thru. 2 stars were for the curt service including lack of apology... for anything. 
Won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"KFC one of the well known food chain. But as competition got tougher they got more expensive and smaller portions. Not good news for the big chain.

To stay competitive, they innovate by giving coupons monthly to households around the area. In this case, I used the 2 can dine for a zinger BLT sandwich. For 9.99 it was a great price, smaller but that's a good thing for me since this is not the most healthiest stuff.

The service was fast and were generous with the ketchup and hot sauce. The place was clean and the drink station were neat and accessible. That's 2 star for the store.

I rate the food as a 1 star. The fries is always good, but the zinger sandwich was mediocre. Had no taste and I tasted the hot sauce more than the chicken itself. Prolly won't order anything anymore besides their chicken, fries and gravy.

In the future, I will probably back. KFC will have a place in my heart but not anytime soon and not going for any of their sandwich. But total stars 3. That's all folks."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at this KFC location, super fast service, friendly drive thru staff. Food was packaged properly, nothing forgotten and was still hot when I got home. A+"}
{"text":"Seriously - You have ONE JOB - which includes getting the order right - did NOT :( Also the soda tastes like FISH ?!?! :("}
{"text":"This place needs to learn how to take more than one order at a time. Every time I stop by I get pissed because it never improves. They will take one order in the drive through, ask you to come to the window, wait until they are ready for payment, pay, wait again, maybe give you the right order, drive away before they do another order. Also the staff are never happy and when did a simple one extra sauce become something you have to pay for. I could go on about this place."}
{"text":"I love KFC's food.  I hate trying to buy it in this location's drive thru.  

I don't know why I never learn, but this location either has the worst systems in place, or the worst manager of those systems in place.  

I pretty much drive-thru almost every time but I'll bet it is 80% of the time that something is either wrong or I've asked for something and it's missing.  It doesn't matter what I order - something is missing and that could be a spoon for the mashed potatoes, it could be straws, butter, honey, napkins, a food item...etc. I will go a couple of months before I visit again because I know they're going to jack it up and then I'll get the urge and sure enough, they DO jack it up!  I have lived by this KFC for 14 years....I have a lot of experience to write this review from.  Some day I will learn not to drive away from the window until I have checked every item.

The worst location as far as getting right of any fast food location I have ever frequented - and I'm 48."}
{"text":"Went thru the drive thru and could hardly understand the employee, Said it would take 10 minutes for chicken wings, ordered 3 pc big box with fries and it came with mashed potatoes. 2 pc was to have cole slaw and came with mashed potatoes and the biscuits were hard as rocks. Not to mention it came to $20.00 WTF. no friendliness whats so ever."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fried chicken fan and I have not been to a KFC in years.  I kept seeing all these ads for how KFC has changed.  They lowered the prices and now have supposed grilled chicken.  NOPE, still awful.  I got a box meal and it was cold.  I ordered a bowl for my husband and they charged me for something else, which was more money.  No sorry or a refund.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Passed by and tried. Not as bad as I thought, meats are full flavored, service is ok, just the meats are a little smaller than I thought. Because I came from another state I just despite it. All in all, it's a mediocre place."}
{"text":"What a waste of time and money! When I pulled in at 6:11 to grab a quick bite on my way home from work I figured they'd be like any other fast food place at dinner time: PREPARED. To my dismay it took roughly 15 minutes to help the 4 vehicles in front of me, which I understand could've been out of their control but what happened next definitely wasn't and is the entire reason I'm writing this review. I pulled up to the speaker to place my order and proceeded to wait for 9 WHOLE MINUTES for someone to acknowledge me being there, even with me asking them 'hello?' And 'anyone there?' As someone who has worked in fast food and service in general my entire life this is completely unacceptable in my opinion. And as the final straw when I got home I found out they forgot to put in any of the bbq sauce I asked for so my tenders and popcorn chicken were not as delicious as I had hoped. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Stop. Just go to Frys and purchase their chicken. You are making a mistake eating here. This location is super slow. Never trust a restaurant that cannot turn over food via consumption quickly. Last amount of advice... go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Worst KFC spot, chicken is dry and when you order a 2 piece combo they cut a breast in half and call it 2 pieces. 
I spoke to someone there about this and all I got back was 'ohhhh' 

If you're craving fried chicken stay away from this location"}
{"text":"Really excellent quality of service by an extremely helpful counter person who showed me exactly what I  needed when I explained the problem.
I paid for the food and visited the (clean!) restroom to wash my hands. When i returned to the counter, my food was ready.
Yes, as another buyer said, its greasy fried chicken. That's exactly what we order at a KFC. If  I had wanted crispy lettuce, I'd have gone elsewhere. Hats off for keeping it real, Colonel Sanders!"}
{"text":"What happened to KFC? It's absolutely horrible!! My husband and I quit going to KFC over 5 yrs. ago because I thought somebody changed the recipe. Not only did they change the recipe but they undercook it too. 
We heard they were going back to the original recipe, so decided to try it again. I asked the young lady where we went  if it was back to the original recipe and she said it was. I said,\" good! I used to love KFC but it changed. It's not the same as it used to be.\" The girl said she didn't know what it used to taste like, she just eats it and likes it. lol 
I could tell just by looking at it that it wasn't the same, but since she said it was the old recipe we took it home and ate it. It was disgusting. Yuck! My husband wanted to throw it out , but I hate wasting food so we ate it , slowly,  grossing out at every bite. and fed it to my sister. lol She likes Churches chicken so I figured she might not mind this too much. They're both tasteless and greasy. 
I have sworn off KFC for the rest of my life unless I hear they really did go back to the old recipe. IT is AWFUL chicken. The worst, even worse than Churches. But I'll go to Churches before I ever go back to KFC. :-("}
{"text":"Guy that was taking the order didn't listen I kept saying chicken breast and he kept repeating with chicken thighs. Next he over charged us and when I talked to a \"supervisor\" Farrah she refused to issue a refund for the over charge and when I asked for the number to corporate she refused to give that information to me. She is so disrespectful and shouldn't have a job. Oh and they would give condiments when asked even when you order a 16 piece meal. Such a rip off!!!! She just couldn't handle customer service at all. She didn't have an answer for the over charge but yet wouldn't give me my money back.  
AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT"}
{"text":"Everything here is fine except there's a major ventilation issue with the fryer.  If they're using it you will smell like it the rest of the day.  I used to go here all the time before they did the refurb.  Since then the ventilation issue has always been there so avoid the place.  If you do go be sure to have some fabreeze handy for after. It's nasty."}
{"text":"This is the worst KFC I have ever been to. It is the closest one to my house, so sometimes I come here to satisfy my chicken craving. But I try to avoid it at all costs. There have been several incidences where I've had to wait 10+ minutes for my food at the drive-thru. That is completely unacceptable for a fast food joint. The first time it happened, I gave them the benefit of the doubt because it was particularly busy that day. But it happened again, then again, then again... They have also cut down their menu tremendously. I used to be a big fan of their Honey BBQ wings. Now they don't even offer any sauces for their wings. This place is not worth your time."}
{"text":"I live in Aliante and this KFC has really gone downhill over the years. As previous reviewers have said, hot wings is always a 10 mins wait (regardless of what time of the day).  They almost (90%) NEVER get the order right, this last time I got the $5.25 meal which is supposed to come with cookie, biscuit, 2 pc chicken & drink.   Got the order, came home and no straw, no spork, no cookie.....  I know management here don't care, because if you look at all the reviews you can clearly tell no one is taking action to improve customer service."}
{"text":"This location needs better quality workers who are happy to have a job good at customer service. The drive-through girl is always incredibly miserable. When you get your food it's a freaking mess with mayo all over can't help it get it all over yourself as you're opening up your sandwich. You hope they gave you napkins because you know you forgot to ask for them which is a tossup. Inside your bag has been toss together. This isn't a one time occurrence this is multiple interactions at the same location and it needs to be addressed."}
{"text":"Minus one star!! Bought chicken for my family for Dinner tonight. When we were done eating, we went to out the leftovers away and the bucket was full of grease!! I was so grossed out!!! I will never buy food from here again!!!! Smh I will add the picture to show ya what I'm talking about! GROSSED OUT FOR LIFE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service and food!  Waited in drive through 30+ minutes (today's excuse was \"the cook walked out\").  Ordered a 5-piece box (repeated my order 3x) and was given a bucket filled with greasy pieces that fell apart when picked up.  Disgusting.   KFC needs a quality control inspection & maybe one by the Health Department?  I won't go back.  Coupons went into the trash tonight."}
{"text":"Not sure what the business model is. No crispy chicken, so half of what they offer is missing. When I settled for what they did have available, they weren't able to take  a credit card. No chicken, can't accept payment, and the window guy, who said he was the manager, was a jerk."}
{"text":"After a long morning of moving, my Dad wanted KFC something awful. Considering this is five minutes from my new digs, we chose this location. 
We walked in around 11:45 on New Year's Day and ordered two $5 lunches. The cashier was slow on the recoil, but knew what she was doing. 
Everything came out quickly, and my Dad was surprised at how \"big the strips\" we're. Five bucks gets you a petty good amount of food, an entree, side, drink and a cookie. The food was a little on the bland side, but I wasn't disappointed by their sweet tea. 
Considering the multitude of drive throughs and take out places within a few minutes from the house, I'll probably find another place to get chicken. 

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"In twenty minutes, I could've walked a mile, watched an episode of New Girl, ordered and received a pizza delivery, cooked a batch of rice,  ordered a medium rare steak.. but, in twenty minutes I wasted my time for an order 5 pieces of chicken wings (when they clearly said 10) & then wait a little extra more.

I'm never usually the one to write reviews on a fast food place because you get what you paid for,  in a sense,  but if you are a fast food establishment and it takes more than 20 minutes to bring out an order of 5 piece wings, then clearly there is something wrong.

I finally got out of my car (because they had told me to park in the front and they'll come out to me) and I see the guy finally bagging up my meal. When I got home to take a bite of these 20+ minute wings, they had tasted like left overs....

Never again."}
{"text":"Do not order hot wings here. Every time they say it will take 10 minutes. This time I really want wings so I ordered. Finally got my food 19 minutes after I ordered it and their excuse was, \"had to let it drain.\"  Correct response is I'm sorry!! Bad service."}
{"text":"Was craving some chicken on a Saturday night, so I thought I would pop on over to KFC not too far from my house.

I was created by a very pleasant guy at the counter. How is it that on a Saturday night, KFC is out of both original and extra crispy white meat chicken?!?!? Is it bad management? Anyway, after looking at the menu, I decided to walk out. The is no reason to buy something that you don't want just because you're in the restaurant. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Lydia is great at her job, she welcomes you talks to you like a friend and wants to make you happy, she was fast and friendly a thing that is gone from almost every fast food place.  Lydia even asked if we needed anything else, got some honey and hot sauce for us too.  She has a great smile and personality.  

Bathrooms were clean and enough space to eat your meal in the dinning room.  

Yummy ckn and mash potatoes too!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place gets a bad rap.
Its KFC people and at this location I get exactly what I expect.
1) Do they process customers quickly and efficiently?
YES
2) Does the chicken taste fresh and is it crispy (fresh grease)?
YES
3) Is the location clean?
YES"}
{"text":"Such nice and friendly people work here. Their chicken is always delicious and fresh. I love their biscuits with honey and butter.  I would definitely check know them out if you are in the area and are in the mood for some chicken."}
{"text":"Too bad you can't give a half star.   This KFC sucks.   I went in trying to order a family meal and the girl ran over to check and told me they didn't have the chicken for it,  I couldn't even wait for some to be made. I order a 10 piece since she mentioned I could order the 10 piece for a lower price instead.  The lady right behind me attempts to order the same family meal and she's told that they just got the chicken in for it.   Not only that but when I checked the receipt the discount wasn't on there.   We questioned it and she told us the price was just for the 10 piece, not for any sides; it was the normal price she was trying to sell us,  I have NO idea why she'd offer that over someone trying to get a family meal.   When we cancelled our order and requested a refund,  no apology was given, no inquiry as to what happened."}
{"text":"Went through drive thru at 940, tried to order a zinger sandwich, girl informed me they dont have anymore. Then i ordered the Tuesday special, they didnt have that either. I asked what they did have, she said chicken tenders, so i ordered the chicken tender fillup cup, then she said it will be a wait. What a joke, i just left. They closed up way early."}
{"text":"I had only ever been through the drive-thru at this location and it was as you would expect from a drive-thru.  Not much customer service to speak of.  Going inside I would expect better that involves more face to face interaction.  Customer service is severely lacking at this location.  The lady taking orders made me feel like I was being an inconvenience.  Excuse me for being a paying customer and therefore a part of your salary, lady.  After I placed my order she threw all my food into a box and handed it over to me before I could even give her my money.  Obviously the food was not fresh though it was very hot.  After I sat down I could hear the staff arguing amongst themselves in the kitchen.  It is unprofessional to do so within earshot of customers.  Sad to see the lack of respect for ones job and customers."}
{"text":"So KFC is not exactly the measure of high quality but it is unforgiveable to not give a man the cookie he so rightfully deserves. That is just hitting below the belt. Sure, the chicken tenders were some of the best I've had from KFC in a long time. They were moist and tender on the inside and perfectly crunchy on the outside. The biscuit they gave me was like any other biscuit. It was soft and a little flakey with a salty finish. I have always liked the mashed potatoes and gravy from KFC. Sure, the gravy has gotten pretty thin in the last few years but it still has good flavor. And instant mashed potatoes have such a smooth consistency. Its just too bad that all I got this time was a half a cup. For $5 I guess I can't expect too much from this meal. Maybe I'll come back but, dammit, I better get my cookie!"}
{"text":"I tried the new boneless chicken, they are very similar to the main meat on a chicken breast. No partical nugget stuff. I was actually pretty impressed. Not to mention they are on sale for just $1 right now with any order. It said limit of 1 but I asked for 2 and they didn't give me any problems."}
{"text":"So not worth your time. You can tell the staff themselves doesn't care. Tried to eat there today. Showed up at 8:35 and tried to enter the lobby. It was locked and the staff clearly sitting at the table refused to acknowledge me. The hours of operation for the lobby were posted till 9 and it was closed 25 minutes earlier if not more! Looks awfully under kept outside as well with little to no actual light outside the store making it difficult to find too."}
{"text":"Worst food experience ever. Horrible service, and food. Food was delivered late cold and with hair in it. Staff on service was unapologetic and extremely rude to deal with. They assured me that they would send out the items ordered that were missed and they did show up again.  HORRIBLE SERVICE AND FOOD!"}
{"text":"Out of business. For some reason, I have to write a whole paragraph about this. So, I will say that they are really, really, really, really, really out of business. Doors locked. Signs gone. Paint peeling off."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying i am being generous giving 3 stars... 

Me and my sister and a couple friends came in to eat lunch.. I was halped right away... Yet after taking my order they told the others behind me that they would be right with them... Now that would be fine if they were gonna be RIGHT BACK... 10 minutes later they were still standing in line... Not a soul to help them... All my friends that are with me are too shy to say anything... So i walked up to the counter and said something... I was told to calm down and that someone would be right with me... After i informed them that the people in line were with me and had been waiting for over 10 minutes someone slowly walked over to them... 

Being in the restaurant industry as well i have some sympathy... I have none here... The staff was rude and inattentive..  

Why on earth would there only be 3 people scheduled at lunch time??? 

Now as i am still sitting here i have seen the same thing happen to 3 other customers... Horrible customer service...


Now the food is good no doubt but i will not be returning...."}
{"text":"Atienden muy mal muy mal carácter  y aparte duran mucho con las órdenes muy mal servicio no lo recomiendo"}
{"text":"KFC is KFC.  What  makes this one so good is Laura. She's incredible in this day of \"push 'em thru\". She will figure out exactly what you want and make it work. She offers options that aren't on the menu.  I've listened to her patiently dealing with the most whacked out, weird, rude people on earth.  Her attitude makes my day."}
{"text":"Terrible!   Came in at 1:00 for lunch. Sign up for sales that ended and wouldn't provide what was advertised. Soda machine out of several sodas. Drive-thru giving out seltzer water as the Mist Twist soda.  Out of lemonade which was a free upgrade.  Forgot my sides. A lady who was here way before us still hadn't received food until after us. Cashier said at least 5 times she was new as an excuse for the problems. All the while the manager is watching from a distance as he plays with the new promotions signs. Lobby's a mess.... dirty tables, trash on floor. Overall, a crappy experience.  Won't be back to this location... wouldn't recommend it to you either."}
{"text":"I'm done with this location. They ALWYAS get the order wrong.  I've talked the manager before & they act like they don't care.  It really isn't rocket science.  You even read back to me what I ordered then again when I pay. This time I was stupid for not checking my order before pulling away and arriving at my destination.  I should've known better.  They got it wrong AGAIN.  Colonel Sanders is rolling over in his grave.  From now on its Church's Chicken or Popeyes.  I'm tired of this stupidity.  I'm paying a lot of money for the wrong order.  I tried calling this time to let them know they may want to pay a little closer attention to what they are doing & the phone number doesn't work.  Frustrating."}
{"text":"I frequent this drive thru often. Fast and friendly during lunch. Food matches its price point. I rock the $5 lunch menu."}
{"text":"Pros: Quick, friendly service. Consistent food quality. 

Cons: greasy fast food chain in a bad neighborhood"}
{"text":"No strips and no original crispy.   A common response when you go in close to closing time.  At the el pollo loco in the same parking lot, another couple said they're constantly running out of biscuits, mashed potatoes, mac & cheese, and cakes.  If you find you're running out of food a lot, either get a better ordering person or close earlier."}
{"text":"I am done with this location ... I don't know what it is but the chicken is Aways nasty . you would think i Learned 

 my lesson the first second third fourth time  . I was hoping .. don't get your hopes up.

Never fresh , tastes salty , chicken dried out ., I can go on .. 
don't waste your money , you been warned

Omg !! Albertson's fried chicken is better then KFC 

Looks like I'll be going to Popeyes"}
{"text":"It's not that bad here and I find it cleaner than other KFCs I've been to. It's never been terribly busy whenever I come. It's just a quiet atmosphere where you can enjoy your food. Customer service is okay."}
{"text":"Went to the drive thru yesterday.  I ordered a bucket of 9 chicken tenders and one hot chicken sandwich.  I got a chicken sandwich with mayo, not hot sauce and our bucket of tenders were not 9.  There were pieces that were skinny fried pieces of breading, no chicken.  The pieces of tenders that were there were tough, hard to chew and very poor quality.  I will not return.  Go to Canes."}
{"text":"I have yet to go to this location and not have my order messed up in some way at the drive thru. Whether it's the wrong size drink, diet instead of Pepsi, or original recipe instead of crispy. They always manage to get something wrong."}
{"text":"I get to the drive through half hour before it closes and the drive through girl tells me there isn't enough chicken for my order. I said I'll get a smaller order, she said they are out of chicken. I haven't had KFC in probably 20 years but I was feeling like some fried chicken. Never again. Out of chicken! This was on 12/29/17."}
{"text":"Every single time I go there the potato wedges are way to over cooked, being an experience cook I could tell that they either leave them in the fryer to long  or their throwing them back into the fryer after being cooked either way that's the only crappy thing about this place I've Experienced everything else is good"}
{"text":"They consistently get my orders wrong no matter what time of day or night and if I go inside or do drive thru, last night my bf went inside and they got it wrong twice before he left and then an hour after eating this my boyfriend, my 2 year old and myself got sick. We were in so much pain all night and still are I actually had to leave work today because I was absolutely useless and couldn't function, and my poor 2 year old has to suffer too because these people and managers cannot thoroughly cook the chicken or make sure their customers are not consuming old spoiled food, I used to work in food and this is so unacceptable not only has their service been rotten but apparently their food is too. Stay away from his place unless your asking for something to go wrong. Will not be returning I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd visit to this location, when we pulled up there were about 8-10 cars in the drive up. It took 20 minutes from the time we got into line, actually PLACE THE ORDER, to getting up to the window to pay. There was this bitchy young girl working the window who acted like she had better things to do. When I asked for a drink carrier it was like pulling teeth. Last 2 visits were great NOT THIS TIME!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love KFC. Anyone who left stars less than 4 has to lower their expectations. It's KFC!! Pot pie was awesome. It more expensive than most fast food but still good once in awhile. This review is shorter than most but then again so am I. Lol"}
{"text":"The Customer service was excellent. The young man working behind the counter was one of the nicest people I've met in customer service! the food was pretty good too."}
{"text":"Drive threw was quick and convenient. Ordered the favorite (kfc famous bowl). Sooooo good! And they weren't stingy on the chicken! Always a plus!"}
{"text":"It's pretty pathetic when you're the only customer in the drive thru AND entire establishment as there was no one inside yet they STILL can't get your freakin order right. 2 meals a side of biscuits and a cake. Get al the way home.. No side of biscuits although clearly charged for them on my receipt. This place is dirty and run down and the service STINKS!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT AT THIS LOCATION! I work in the area and happened to go in during lunch when the health inspector was there. During my 10 minute (and final) visit I heard the manager remind staff members twice times to wash their hands before handling food. One had just come from the restroom and the other was a cashier who came off the register to help out in the kitchen. If this happens when the health inspector is there imagine what happens when he isn't. Disgusting!"}
{"text":"Waited to order for 20 minutes and I was at the front of the counter the whole time. No one helped. At least 6 employees in back. no one taking orders.  Asked for manager twice. No show. We left,  pissed and hungry."}
{"text":"OVERPRICED and the portions sizes are small compared to POPE YES. The drive-thru is s u p e r slow. Underwhelming  seasoning on their chicken.  Service is poor in the drive thru. Before McDonald's they actually looked as if they were happy to be crappy. A business that has sucked money out of the community."}
{"text":"Nastiest KFC I've ever been to. I had got the $20 fill up. Got home open the chicken box, the thigh meat look old and light brown as you can tell it was sitting out for hours. Then I bite into the biscuit, it instantly crumbled in my mouth. It was so hard. My daughter chicken thigh had lots of flour and grease on the bottom that was gooey. Never ever going here."}
{"text":"Nasty chicken.. got the chicken tenders with bbq. They were very stale and dry. Think they might have been sitting for a while. I've had frozen chicken that tasted better. Stay away from here."}
{"text":"I never eat here but was starving and needed something fast. I was quickly reminded why I don't eat here. 

They had changed their menu so it didn't look like they have the dinner meals with two sides any more only combos that come with one side. Fine, I'll roll with that. I go to order a #4 but \"which number 4 would that be?\" Apparently there are multiple #4s which defeats the purpose of having the combos numbered.

Next I was told they currently didn't have ice after I ordered my drink. This was not something I could roll with. How can you sell drinks without ice?  Luckily for me she kindly let me replace my drink with a second side.

As I pulled up to the window to pay I was thrown another curve ball. It would be 3.5 mins before my order was ready and I need to pull up to wait so the other customers behind me could continue to pay and be on their way.  What is the purpose of fast food if you have to pull aside and wait?"}
{"text":"i was having a rough and stressful day.. and very hungry..  i was craving chicken and only place near me..  KFC.. what more is there to write about?? it says it all KFC!  

should i talk about rude employees? should i talk about how dirty it was? or maybe i should talk about how nasty the food it was?? ummmmm...  

well.. i was hungry.. and i was not planning to drive.. so i ordered grilled chicken..  okay..\"sigh\".. here is the problem.. i didn't care much about  rude customer service.. place being dirty.. or order took little longer than usual..  but all i wanted was juicy tender grilled chicken with my hot sauce and wash it down with ice cold soda..  am i asking too much here?? can a man take the time and enjoy his life a little?
nah.. i was asking too much...

chicken was soo dry.. it can pass for beef jerky.. come on now? 
at this point.. i realized and understood.. why some people gone insane and start shooting... i really wanted to throw my chicken at the staff who prep it..  

now i know why they call it KFC.. killed for chicken!!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Ordered popcorn chicken and got an old gray meat piece that smelled like old rotten chicken"}
{"text":"This KFC charges you whatever price they decide to when you go through the drive-thru. It does not matter that they clearly have one price listed on the menu. When you get to the window and ask them why the price is different they tell you the price went up and you either pay it or don't.  This is without a doubt the worst fast food place in all of the greater Las Vegas area. The employees are rude, unkept and have zero customer service skills. I can't image why KFC allows them to operate under their name. Go anywhere else to eat. As you can see by the photo the bucket of legs and thighs is $10 but when you go around to pay they change you $10.99"}
{"text":"Terrible. We got home after ordering a 9 piece family bucket of chicken and started eating only to discover that the taste and smell of the chicken was off. After trying to eat a few pieces we quickly figured out that the chicken/oil was rancid, at which point we couldn't stomach eating any more of it. Waste of time and money.

Either the oil the chicken is being fried in is old and has gone off, or the chicken had been sitting out under the heater for so long that it had turned rancid. Either way the standards for health and cleanliness are obviously lacking at this KFC location and should be investigated!

When we called the location to complain we were told the oil was fine, nothing was wrong, and that KFC headquarters only has them change the oil once a week once you can't see past 2 inches. Ew. Here's a clue: If a customer says something is off you should listen and look into it, not argue, brush them off and declare that it's fine."}

Called today, and \"all they can do is forward my concern\"... gimme a break! Everyone has a bigger boss, and I'll find him. I'm not going away and this issue has gotten 10 fold bigger and now I understand why a little vegas store is so inept when they have the corporate offices working the exact same inefficient way. UN-REAL!!!!"}
{"text":"If you haven't yet heard, the new offering from Kentucky Fried Chicken strains the limits of comprehension of even the most hardened fast-food lover in you. To wit: it's called the \"Double Down,\" and is basically a cordon-bleu-sandwich thing using two chicken breasts as its structure. Yes, you heard me right. It's a sandwich that eschews the most lowly ingredient (bread) and replaces it with what you've been looking for all of your life: MORE MEAT. 

I was expecting this thing to be a monstrosity that would immediately give me a coronary. TRUTH IS: it was pretty good! The \"bread\" was two boneless fried chicken breasts that rival Chick-Fil-A for tastiness, and between them were two thin strips of bacon, some phantom cheese, and sauce that can only be described, by one of my co-workers, as tasting \"orange.\"

Good on ya, K.F.C. One can only hope more fast-food places follow your lead. Perhaps Taco Bell could make a tortilla out of bacon? I'm just thinking out loud here."}
{"text":"Sunday evening and no original dark... umm when did you decide you might need chicken.  Slow service. I guess I should have went to Popeyes."}
{"text":"I like this location. They have a softdrink infinite machine and super cheap icecream. Their food is cheap and it's near an unaffordable area (Yorkville). I have never had a wrong order yet and they always send me coupons in the mail."}
{"text":"I ordered a 12 piece chicken fingers this evening and only got 10. I didn't check in the store because the sides and biscuits were there. With the four people at the party we didn't really have enough tenders. It was disappointing for $25. 
The inside was quite acceptable. I had to wait about 5-8 minutes for my food which was fine. 
All sides were fine."}
{"text":"Had to wait 15 min for Two cars to get through the drive-through ahead of me when I finally get up the order they try to tell me you have to order original when I said I want crispy they say oh we're all out how do you run out of food on a Saturday night knowing that it's going to be busy I didn't even complete the order I just went home not worth my time avoid this place"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is the worst KFC that I have ever been to.  My mom loves KFC and I have stopped by this location close to her home on several occasions to pick up a drive thru order. Each visit they state they don't have Crispy only Original and they can't make any either. On my recent visit they were out of coleslaw too which is a staple item for them. I wish this location had better management or system controls to ensure they can operate effectively."}
{"text":"Always out of something, which is interesting since they never seem to have customers. Chicken strips always tast like they are old - left overs from day before??? Their workers are always grouchy. Go the extra couple miles and visit the KFC on Van Buren."}
{"text":"Typical KFC food. But the help leaves a lot to be desired, many times the order isn't correct. And they seem to frown on having to do it a special way (all white meat please)"}
{"text":"Typical KFC food, but at this location. One thing is different, they seem to care about the customer, and getting the food order correctly done and fast."}
{"text":"Worst KFC I have ever been to.. they are always out of chicken and when we order wings it's always a 20 minute wait.. try another place at least Popeyes never runs out of chicken"}
{"text":"Copy/paste the other reviews.  It is now several months since the last comments and we experienced the exact same. They only had wings, nothing else and it would be a 20min. wait for any other style. One OFFer was apologetic, the drive thru attendant was not and had nothing to say about the chicken restaurant not having chicken, despite their advertised special."}
{"text":"Needs to be  cleaned. But over all this joint not bad at all.. Hot.. Good food. Great customer service"}
{"text":"I don't know why I decided to stop and pick up some KFC since my last experience about a year ago. I'm not a frequent KFC eater, but I have fond memories of their chicken from childhood. Also, compared to Popeyes and Churches chicken, I prefer the breading by KFC.

The chicken strips DO NOT have the KFC chicken breading. I was a bit disappointed. And, it wasn't good. 

Fried original chicken- 3 stars. Breading flavor is still the same. It was overly salty however. 

Mashed potatoes- mehhhhhhhh. 

Corn- mehhhhhhhhhhhh. 

Biscuits- mehhhhhhh. It lacked any crispy edges or surface and was just a mushy biscuit. 

Potato wedges- 2 stars. Not crispy, and it tasted like it's been sitting in the heat for an hour. 

I ordered a chicken strip meal for $5, which comes with a drink, mashed potatoes, and a chocolate chip cookie. I didn't bother to check my orders before I left. THEY FORGOT THE COOKIE. I was really sad, since the cookie was the reason I was lured into the combo meal. 

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Give me my cookie back!!!!!!!!! :( 

Oh, the \"finger lickin' good\" sauce was finger lickin' okay. It tastes like thousand island mixed with ketchup."}
{"text":"Typical fast food.  I tried to use a coupon for a free pot pie and I was told \"we no longer take coupons\" by a Mgr lady.  I was told very nicely, mind you but nonethess I was told to piss off essentailly.  When I decided on a meal I was told \"we out of biscuits\".  WHO RUNS OUT OF DAMN BISCUITS?!!"}
{"text":"Worse tasting chicken I've ever had. All 3 variety a are cold, dry, old, and awful tasting. Don't know how this place is even a KFC."}
{"text":"This kfc is straight trash. Can't trust your order when you get it through the drivr thru window. Charged me extra for food that i didnt even get. 2nd time this happened to me. I thought the first it was a mistake but i guess its normal for them to mess up on a daily basis."}

{"text":"This was the worst experience my husband and I have ever had with a food place, ever! First of all we sat in front of the speaker box for at LEAST 5 minutes in the drive through before anyone even acknowledged we were there. Then when the girl asked for our order she was extremely rude. Then we waited another 5 minutes at the window waiting to pay and recieve our food. And then when we handed her our credit card she walked away twice with it, out of my eye sight which is terrible customer service. And on top of that when we got our food it was the wrong order... I'm never going back to this kfc ever again. I highly suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"My hubby went to get us KFC chicken tonight and when he cam home was so aggitated at the  lack of professionalism that was displayed by the employees. He said they were so loud he could hear their conversation about going bowling and one employee told the other to just call in sick. That wasnt bad until she couldnt hear his order over the speaker due to the conversation going on inside including the person my husband was talking to, he had to repeat many times. Then he pulled up to the window and the same conversation was still going back and forth. The casheir at the window
couldnt focus at the task at hand.  My husband ordered 12  piece meal. When he came home we has 9 piece meal.  Needless to say the chicken looked thrown in the bucket and some of the skin was of the top of the chicken. The gravy tastes like there wasnt enough water added and was very paste like. We normally really love KFC however we have had many problems every time we go as of late. Really second guessing KFC anymore. We had called and asked for the corporate number and she said she didnt know it and she was the manager. She gave us the GM number but no anserw. I will be calling again tomorrow.  I hope they bring back the good old day food of the past and learn how to count and serve."}
{"text":"So they charge .75 a wing to try their new sauces and if you order the full order and not like them oh well... no money back...no exchange...your problem if their product is less than par. And ahen i asked the female manager laughed at me... am i crazy? Or was that just bad customer service?"}
{"text":"Our order was originally messed up. After calling them, the manager, Luis, not only made it right, but made everything fresh, and was so polite. I appreciate this so much!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure whether or not they changed their policy, but the first (and only) time I ordered food at this location, the cashier warned me that they would be slapping a service fee onto my bill because I was paying with a debit card. What year is this again?

If this were some small mom and pop outfit, I wouldn't be surprised, but I've never seen a national chain pull this stunt. In fact, I'm not even sure if they're allowed to - until I realized it's most likely the result of a very stingy franchisee who's attempting to maximize his or her profit. Of course, what they don't realize is that by doing this, all it does is anger patrons to the point where you ultimately end up losing more business than you bring in. Especially when you can just drive down the road and give your debit card to another location without them so much as batting an eye. 

I haven't been back and will never be back.

Based on the god-awful reviews, it looks like I'm not missing out on much."}
{"text":"Seriously? This place hella sucks. Customer service is just bad!

Sooo I went through the drive through and the lady on the speaker too her sweet time asking what I would like. I asked about a few things and decided on a mixed 10 piece bucket thing. She stated I could get 2 boneless breasts then a mixture of anything else. I did just that, I wanted 2 BB and the rest legs. OF COURSE they were a few short of what I wanted so she offered more breasts to which I accepted. She gave me my total, which was not the same as she had quoted earlier and I proceeded to the window. A different lady then gave me ANTOHER more expensive total and I asked why? \"Because you added more breasts\" I rebutted that the order taker offered since they were out and the cashier shook her head and reassured me I would need to pay the upcharge.

Don't offer something because you ran out of an item then expect the customer to pay. And 3 different totals is no bueno!

I asked for my card back and left. Customer service is horrid and the employees seem like they hate their jobs. 

No Yay! for you!"}

I use to like ordering from this location on a regular basis but I am really sorry to say my business with KFC has ended. My email to corporate has not been returned."}

legendary cole slaw.  Everything is hot and tastes home made! So, if you like chicken, 
head up to the Streetsboro KFC...you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Colonel Sanders would be rolling over in his grave at what became of KFC in Canada.  I have no idea where they source their chicken from but these are some of the smallest pieces of chicken I've ever encountered.  This is a general comment not just this store.

Generally it's a tired store.  The pieces are cooked okay.  But more times than not I get mangled pieces.  Usually not overly greasy.  Service is normal fast food style.  

With a Popeyes chicken literally around the corner I'm not sure why anyone would come here."}
{"text":"Went there for a side of mashed potatoes and a biscuit to be able to take meds for a headache.  We, my daughter and I ended up getting the $5 fill up boxes.  I asked the young lady in the drive thru if she could make SURE that I got fresh biscuits.  We also asked for Strawberry Lemonade with our meals. 

I'm rating this place with only one star because we didn't get cookies that come with the $5 box.  My biscuits were barely warm and that freshness was REALLY important to me.  I was told that they didn't have any jelly for the biscuits so I asked for butter and also didn't get that.  I am not a connoisseur of Lemonade, but it really tasted like Grapefruit juice.  The barely pink lemonade didn't have even a hint of Strawberry flavor, so I will have to say KFC is the first fast food restaurant to serve Pink Grapefruit juice as a beverage.  It was terrible!"}
{"text":"I drove here over the Woodlawn location based on the service or sans service at teh Woodlawn location. 

I was ignored upon entering. NO drive through based mixing grilled and extra crispy seems to confuse some folks. 
0 stars for the restroom - eww
2 stars for someone finally asking if I had been serviced. 
HELP me Savior for the young lady that should have taken my order instead she kept working on something for someone. Two managers asked her to take my order and let someone else expo. 
She needed the manager to discount the check for the coupon - welp - she couldn't and called a 2nd manager. 

I will give them kudos for being able to get along with one another and maintain a friendly work environment. 

I believe the 2nd Mgr tried to make for all the shortcomings by throwing more chicken in the bucket. To my shock: KFC brought the buckets back! Shazam."}
{"text":"I haven't had KFC in a long time and now I know why. The service was awful, the food wasn't the best for the price. Oh and my wife and I got very sick after eating the food."}
{"text":"After visiting this location,  and getting the $5 fill up combo , ive been sick, throwing up, i will never visit kfc again"}
{"text":"After coming here all I could do was laugh...

We go in the drive thru at 9 - they close at 10

First of all no one asked the car in front of us what they wanted for a good 3 minutes

When it was our turn my boyfriend asks for a number 2 (2 piece chicken meal) to which the girl says she needs to check on the chicken and she says all she has is extra crispy - no thanks we don't want the old ass chicken that's been sitting out and now is \"extra crispy\"

So he asked for a $5 meal which she says okay but you need to pick a different side because no potato wedges are ready - okay fine..mashed potatoes and a lemonade. An order of popcorn chicken (to which she reminds us that we can't have potato wedges unless we wait - fine we don't want the damn potato wedges) and 2 extra biscuits.

So we are laughing while waiting for our food that a kfc doesn't have chicken... and my boyfriend says at least ill get my lemonade, can't screw that up

So the time comes and we get our food and there are no biscuits and.... they gave my boyfriend a flat ass coke colored drink

So they did fuck up lemonade"}
{"text":"This place is so GROSS!!! My daughter received a moldy biscuit in her meal. I called them and basically they do not care at all. 

Don't eat there !!!"}
{"text":"3pc white meat meal, crispy, 9.99.  two good sized breasts and a wing, potatoes/gravy, slaw, biscuit and soda.  overall the meal was good.  should always not eat the biscuit...dry.    
+ no one was there, so service was very fast.  
- no military/police/1st responder discount.  

trop right now (4/12/16) is being repaved, so expect to only go east when leaving, and you have to cut a uturn at the intersection or wind through parking lot, so maybe that's why not too many customers at 5pm on a tues.  

consistent food.  I'd eat there again if they offered a check-in or 1st responder discount.  otherwise, I'd just check into another KFC where ever I'm at."}
{"text":"Did the drive thru and they failed to secure the lid on my gravy so all the gravy leaked out all over my order. Trying to call the store back and no one answers just rings 15 times then busy signal."}
{"text":"2 nights in a row I came here. Order wrong both times. Drive thru asked for someone who speaks English to talk to me. Ordered corn they gave coleslaw. I went to the door at 9:40pm and it's locked. Yet they close at 10pm... makes no sense. They also didn't have what I ordered so I said I'll wait for them to make it and they said no. Damn this place sucks. If you're not gonna make what customers order how are u gonna make money?"}
{"text":"For a long time I have not gone to KFC and on this night I felt I needed it... I also had to try the Double Down sandwich.... I was greeted with a very friendly staff with prompt fast service. I ordered the Double Down with an order of Coleslaw, Mash Potatoes with gravy and one drum stick... I rate the food as followed.

Double Down Sandwich - D
Coleslaw - B+
Mash Potatoes with gravy - B+
Drum Stick - B

I have always enjoyed some KFC every once in awhile... I was glad I had made this stop I forgot how much I like the Coleslaw and Mash Potatoes with gravy great stuff... I will be back again someday for sure."}
{"text":"Just to say it....I've NEVER had a great experience coming to this particular location. There's ALWAYS some issue when I visit this place...whether it's a long wait, wrong order, out of chicken (YES!)...etc. But I saw the commercial for the Tennessee chicken and it pulled me in! So, I told the wife I was going to get chicken and jokingly said \"I'll be back in two hours\". When I get there, there's a young lady behind the counter telling all of her personal problems to the customer in front of me in line, who which through conversation I find out she already knew. She had already taken his order, but I had to wait for her therapy session to end! Finally, I get to put in my order. I ordered a 2 piece Tennessee chicken meal, 10 hot wings, and a cookie. She hands me the cookie and I look at it and half of it was missing. It looked like someone had eaten half of it! I told the girl and she says \"all of the cookies are broken like that\". Like I was being unreasonable for wanting a whole cookie! She then finds me a whole cookie after just briefly walking over to the cookies and grabbing another one. I then walk over to get my diet coke. The syrup was obviously low. It tasted awful. So I asked her if she could get me some from the fountain in the drive-thru. She complained about that! She said if one if low, more than likely both are low. I asked her to please check. Guess what? The diet coke from the drive through fountain tasted just fine.  I waited almost 15 minutes for the chicken wings after initially being told it would take only 4 minutes before they would be ready. They ended up giving me extra for the wait. 
This place employees people who seem to not care at all about the job they have. They don't seem to know about anything about customer service. The facility is always dirty, dimly lit at night, has an awful greasy smell in it. The fountain machine looks like it has never been cleaned. The parking lot invites improper behavior as it too needs added lighting. 
I'm not sure if this place is franchised or not, but whoever owns this place should be ashamed of it. This place is the worse KFC I've ever been too. If another KFC commercial comes on TV enticing me to get chicken, someone please remind me not to come this location!"}
{"text":"Not too happy anymore with KFC.  Lunch special 3 Wing snack and a snack & a biscuit plus a regular taco and bean burrito...disappointment with the wings The wings are getting smaller and smaller. They look the size of a pigeon not a chicken.   Taco and bean burrito saved the day!!!"}
{"text":"Every single person that went through the drive-through has to go sit in the parking lot and wait 20 minutes or longer! This is absolutely ridiculous ordered a pot pie didn't get a fork !!!! You do need a fork or some type of silverware to eat a pot pie !!! didn't get any napkins the coleslaw was sitting on top of the warm pot pie for some reason ! This KFC needs HELP! Look at how many bad reviews this place has ! Will never return here again!"}
{"text":"Mashed potatoes gravely COLD
No seasoning 
Cloeslaw okay 
Won't be BACK
What else is there to say"}
{"text":"I rarely rate fast food restaurants anything beyond a 3-star, but I feel comfortable giving this KFC a 3.5, upgraded to a 4 star for good service.

This is the closest KFC to my house, and I do visit here every so often if I just want a quick takeout. I generally prefer stand-alone fast food restaurants than fast food places in shopping malls (sorry Markville).

Since the KFC is in a heritage area, it retains its vintage exterior design, which I honestly prefer over the modernized KFC look. It just gives the traditional, down to earth feel every time you drive or walk to the parking lot.

KFC is probably the only fast food joint I will regularly visit, so I can tell which one does it best. This one does it very good. The chicken pieces are consistently juicy and crispy (but not too crispy), and the macaroni salad has the right amount of pasta and dressing. Also, the gravy is darker and thicker; another sign of good taste because gravy should never be light yellow or watery.

The service here has really improved in the past few years. When I came here at first the cashier was rather cool and didn't talk much (or gave a rather undermining tone), but when I came here tonight she was very jubilant and talkative. The kitchen staff is also very efficient in preparing the orders, and will tell you if you need to wait for any part of your meal.

As health experts say, have fast food in moderation. When you're up for fried chicken and want KFC though and are in Markham, I highly recommend this joint.

Take-out only. Cash and debit accepted."}
{"text":"Stay clear of this place...
Just spoke to the general manager \"Kevin\" about or horrible experiences there. Bad bad employees and inedible food.  He said they know the store is struggling and they know that they have \"no one trained\" there. That being said he refused to refund via mail. I would have to drive down and ask for the refund in person. I offered to email or snail mail the receipt, but would not waste any more of my time or gas money so he can keep trying to \"train\" their staff.  Avoid this place like the plague!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the 14 piece deal to go. I mentioned to them to please check the order on number of chicken pieces because I was short one piece last time. When I got home which is a 30 minute drive , again my order was short 1 piece of chicken again. This is a place where I feel that they short you on purpose."}
{"text":"This location is soon slow 20 minutes in the drive thru.   Ridiculous! !!!!!   They need a lesson in Fast Food or give up the drive thru.   And they didn't have the chicken I wanted."}
{"text":"This KFC location is a franchise location. The service consistency is poor. One visit I may get stellar service and spectacular food and the next visit quite the opposite. Today I was forced to drive fifteen miles one way to speak to a manager because the franchise owner does not see the importance of a Landline. Once I found out that there is no phone on site I began to understand why employees wear headphones, don't tuck their shirts in and quite frankly don't appear to care about how they represent the company or even themselves. When I drove through last night my order was not filled correctly, I was not provided napkins/utensils, and a dipping sauce spilled all over inside the bag. I tried to call the restaurant to no avail. Many customer complaints could most likely be solved at the store level if they had a phone but customers are forced to escalate to corporate.  This is in addition to the fact that many of the employees are young minimum wage people, if there is an emergency there is no phone to contact help. The only way to improve this location is to keep working with corporate to put pressure on the franchise owner to put the appropriate effort and resources into this location."}
{"text":"KFC is a great place for chicken. It's a good place to get lots of food for the family and most likely expect leftovers depending on how many people are eating and how much food you get. There buckets of chicken can feed about 4-6 people. Which is very handy if you want a few leftovers for later. There mash potato bowls are great meals just by themselves. With corn, gravy, and popcorn chicken on top. It goes great with there creamy buttery bread. And even though it may be soft and a little crumbled, it's a sweet bread that taste better with the butter and honey packets. There food is good and would be good to go to every once in awhile."}
{"text":"We always order the chicken and tenders for two and are ALWAYS told to pull around front and wait. Every time. Tonight Bret got our order wrong, didn't even apologize and then told us to pull out front where it took five minutes to get them. One star because my son loves their food."}
{"text":"Got the $20 bucket of fingers and some sides.  Lots of food that tasted great."}
{"text":"Literally the worst kfc !!!! If I could put NEGATIVE 5 stars I would ! I pull up to the drive thru and order with two people talking to me thru the drive thru box not taking my order serious at all.  Then I pay at the second window where the tell me to pull up and wait for 5 minutes so they can bring my food out. I wait for 10 mins & one of the employees walks out and asks what I'm doing there waiting . I told him that the employee I paid with told me to pull up here for my food. Then he asks what I order & tried saying I didn't order & accused me of not paying . He then brings out the employee that I paid with where he too didn't know what I was talking about. Literally the most stupidest fucks I've ever had to deal with . Never coming here again. All together I was here for about 35 mins."}
{"text":"OK so its a KFC, fast food should be judged and compared to its peers. That being said no it is not Popeye's bit to quote Oscar Madison, played by the late great Jack Klugman. \"I like that man I trust his face.\" There is something very American about a cat working in a gas station and saying, hey let's sell the hell out of some fried chicken. And sell they did. Yes they need to work on the sides, would french fries kill you, and what the devil happened to the the Colonels Greens? Still it doesn't matter if you like Original Recipe or Extra Crispy we can all agree that KFC is a classic. Now I want some chicken, curse you KFC for being so close to my house! Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"Let's call this what it is, KFC Taco Bell Hell...after waiting in the line for 15 minutes without being acknowledged they then come on and tell me all we have is Taco Bell for 15-20 minutes. They knew I was at the drive thru and I even called the store to see if they were open and whoever answered said \"yes wait what was the question?\" Are you !?! \"Yes but I'm waiting onto system to come up and my cashiers to count their drawers.\"  I called to get the number for corporate and they couldn't find it but told me to call back in an hour to speak to a manager, I told her the reason for calling and she asked someone \"she sat in the drive through for 15 minutes?\" To which the response was \"I don't know\"! This store clearly needs to change their opening time and most importantly their staff. And yes some type of system is always down. The last time I was here the system was down so I sat at the drive thru and listened to one of the workers talk on the phone about her DSS case. Don't waste your time with this location. This store is a joke."}
{"text":"They are out of original chicken again at 5:30 pm. You would think YUM would know how to run restaurants but I guess not."}
{"text":"I was shocked to see this place had three and a half stars, but only two people have reviewed it, so that makes sense. They renovated a little inside, looks more modern, too bad it is filthy...everything is sticky from the counter to the filth that covers the drink machine, the floor, and tables and chairs. Finding this revolting,  I've tried the drive through...another bad idea..the employees are miserable and I've waited in the drive through line for an unreasonablely long time. I guess that is someone telling me \"noooo fast food\" but man I love some kfc mashed potatoes. Unfortunately for this place, I don't love them enough to ever come back here."}
{"text":"There are two reviews?? For fast food, this is really good tasting, food for an excellent price. The Nashville chicken is my new favorite, but there are many choices such as grilled chicken, and original recipe that are less healthy but great, classic options!"}
{"text":"The food are healther than original kfc. They  have some selections of salads like colesaw and lettuce. But they dont have macaroni and potato salad. The waffle fries are very good. But I expect more selections like a poutine fries or maybe onion rings. The side dish is the only thing that let me down. Whenever I order food from KFC select I dislike order their combo. The reason is becaus the side dishes. The burgers are good and the chicken is amazing. The drinks are good too. They just need good side dish."}
{"text":"How many times can one drive-thru screw up your order?
This place, has consistently screwed up my order each and every time that I have made the incredibly dense decision to pick up food here. The potato wedges were so old that they were more like chips, the new gold chicken that sounded wonderful, was dry and mislabeled. The tacos purchased all contained meat that was so greasy that the taco shells were wet. We had to return to the restaurant after leaving the drive-thru because it was so bad. The food we got to replace the disgusting food, was equally as disgusting. Clearly, nobody really wanted to do their job today."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice now. Both times the service was good and the food came fast.  I read the reviews prior to coming the first time. It appears that people have only complained about everything, which is why I am writing this review. 

We got exactly what we ordered, and had zero issues with the taste of our food."}
{"text":"In comparison to the one on 17th Avenue and Bethany Home, this one is stellar. The only thing they have done wrong, but multiple times, is forget my biscuits. Now I check for biscuits in the parking lot before driving home. No 20-30 minute wait for your drive thru order like the KFC on Bethany."}
{"text":"Worst KFC ever! I have a relative that lives near here, so I go here periodically. Every time is a disaster. They ALWAYS have some big issue. One time they said they were out of half the menu. I don't know how this restaurant is still open. I assume it is a franchise, if that's the case, the franchise owner doesn't know what they're doing!!!!!! I thought I heard the guy behind the register say they made him manager and he's only worked there 4 weeks."}
{"text":"Yikes!!! Sadly this is nothing like a KFC I've always been too. The service is VERY slow food always cold and sadly they don't even open on time. This is close by my children's school and hey love tacos and 2 PCT chicken. But 1 outta the 3 times I visit here weekly they mess up. They don't have food ready even though they open at 11, drive thru isn't open at 11. I've sit in the drive they 10 min waiting and finally drive around and go in and they're standing talking.  I guess management needs to explain when you come to work at 10 you prepare the food.  People try to be nice but you can see they're annoyed."}
{"text":"They have the worst service! They are rude, slow and always get the order wrong. I have gone in quite often and Shannon is always there... the only one busting her butt there. The tables don't get cleaned and condements not stocked. This place needs more help and quit hiring young kids that don't care if they have a job or not."}
{"text":"Worst KFC I've ever been in. Restrooms are horribly maintained. Always out of things."}
{"text":"Worst KFC I've ever been to. The men's room faucet has been broken for months. Horrible rotten fish odor in the restroom (mens). I can only assume that the health inspector that services this location is female or this would have been a violation. There is a loud buzzer installed on the door when you walk in, catches me off guard every time. Usually only one employee working. Dining room is typically very cold. 

They are constantly out of food. Ice tea is only available behind the counter and tastes horrible (both sweet & unsweetened) 

Very new location, these issues can only be attributed to poor management."}
{"text":"Followed my review and closed, probably due to bad customer service! This place was under horrendous management! Incorrect orders, cold orders at drive thru. Ignorant workers, do I need to say more to achieve review status?"}
{"text":"This is the slowest \"fast\" food restaurant in existence! We stop in because it's on the way home, giving them the benefit of the doubt, and are constantly disappointed.  We sat in the drive through for ten minutes in 115 degree heat today waiting for our two $5 meals! And then they forgot our drink and had to wait another 5 minutes inside for someone to notice someone standing near the register. 
They weren't crowded. There was no line. The restaurant was empty. For good reason.  Standard MO for this location is for one person to take the order. That same person. Will the. Leave the register to put together that order. Sometimes this means they need to prepare or cook something, so it could take a few minutes. After that order is filled will that person return to the register to help who's next in line. 
Poor management and slow service. I'll be going elsewhere in the future to get take out."}
{"text":"On more than one occasion, I've had an order messed up but the other night was the last straw.  I ordered the new Gold tenders.  Got Nashville.  Asked to add an order of potato wedges to go with the cole slaw that came with the tenders.  Got two orders of cole slaw.

This isn't the first time.  Slow drive-through window even when not busy.  Window personnel are often aloof and frequently even rude.

Won't go back again."}
{"text":"I practically survuved on KFC in high school but over the last 20 yrs it has just lost its allure.


I still like the coleslaw & biscuits but the chicken just isnt up to snuff anymore. Last time I visited I tried the new Chipotle flavored and it was just awful. The stuff is soooo greasy I can never eat more than 1 pc and I'm a guy who can put away some food.

I still risk it every time I get a coupon in the mail...I guess I'm always hoping it will be good again."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the WORST KFC in the WORLD, you found it. Absolutely nothing good to say about this place. Service, management, food, speed, cleanliness. You won't get what you order anyway, so Go ANYWHERE else."}
{"text":"They got a couple of my orders wrong
I wanted to substitute my cole slaw for Mac and cheese 

I got my Mac and cheese 
But they took away my mashed potatoes and left me with Cole slaw 

And I asked for Mayo on my slider 
It was dry

 the biscuits aren't that good 
And both brewed teas taste horrible"}
{"text":"Long wait, workers are rude and complain if they have any work to do. Cashier complained to me about people ordering on Christmas eve completely unprofessional. No warning about longer waits and rolled eyes at me when I stated I couldn't wait 20 minutes for 2 pieces of chicken."}
{"text":"First of all we had a bad experiece the first time we came, there was a 20 minute wait for biscuits, they gave us the wrong order, and no honey or butter, also no receipt. We could not even call and complain because the phone was out of service. We called corporate and they sent us a $10 card to be used at this same location. We wanted to give them another chance so we went in and what i witnessed was horrendous attitude from the front cashier. 

Lady had been waiting 30 minutes for her food. Politely asks the clerk when her food will be ready. Clerk says \"When its packed up..., I have a line thats priority over you\"
 This lady continued to be polite however the clerks balling into the cash register.The finally customer gets her food and is around the corner getting a drink unbeknownst to the manager who walks up to the clerk and has the nerve to say \"dont you cry mija, miserable **** like that don't deserve to have customer service\" Even after all that the customer only said \"Im not sure why you're crying when you were rude to me\" and walked out with her head high as the clerk repeatedly yells \"Have a nice day ma'am\"

That whole fiasco took about 45 minutes, then our food was ready and of course our order was wrong. Needless to say we wont be back and the Manager and cashier should be ashamed of themselves."}
{"text":"This location is always hit or miss. Normally they don't give the sauces you request which is annoying. But this last time as you see in the picture they really got my order wrong."}
{"text":"Food was cold and didn't taste good. I don't know what it is about the fast food in this center, Taco Bell and subway, all tastes gross. I go to other KFC's and the food is fine."}
{"text":"The service was slow and the chicken was super greasy."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service. Went to the drive thru and it took forever for the food to be ready, considering this is \"fast food.\" Also, I ask for extra sauce and napkins and I only get one sauce and no napkins. After eating my chicken, I wake up a few hours later at 2AM and find myself vomiting and sick to the stomach. I was forced to miss school and had to spend the day in the hospital for \"severe food poisoning.\" This chicken brand used to be good but now it's only ever deteriorating with the brand focusing more on its image than its service. smh 0/10"}
{"text":"As a favour to my mother, you will find me lining up at KFCs on 17th for 2.49 chicken, it used to be 2 loonies Tuesdays but with inflation costs; it now costs 2.49.

There is always a nice serpent-like waiting line there, usually filled with folks that don't have too much money.  Service is fast considering the line and the KFC staff here gives nice orderly pleasant service.  The package come with golden fries and your usual take out condiments.

It is still greasy KFC chicken that hits the spot when you are in the mood for that good old fashioned secret recipe.  So all in all it's okay.  I usually find packages of untouched fries near the garbage bin and I end up saving those and passing them out to the many hungry folks who are usually waiting on a park bench in the back next to the parking lot.

If you are a fan of KFC, then check them out every Tuesday.  For 2.49 it still is a fast sure cheap way to clog up your arteries once a week."}
{"text":"Was very pleased and surprised how clean and organized the restaurant was. Haven't been to kfc in about 10 years. The commercials pulled me in to try it again. Very happy with the food, hot and fresh. Counter man Vince was especially pleasant and extremely thorough and very well trained. Wish all customer service associates were more like Vince. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Tried to give this kfc another chance last night and the first thing they tell me in the drive thru is \"we are really low on chicken.\" So I decided to order a pot pie. They informed me they are also out of pot pies, so I left....not exactly sure what they DID have. Be warned, this KFC closes at 8:00pm...sign says 10:00pm but if you get there after 8, they'll be out of food and refusing to cook more."}
{"text":"Won't be back to this location! I thought I could whip through the drive through but no. Waited 30 minutes for wings at lunch time."}
{"text":"Went here for a family bucket. It's been over 5 years since we tried KFC and they reminded us why. There were some rowdy customers that held the cashier's attention for about 15 min. A customer returned with their order, it was wrong, and the cashier argued with them. Another customer was tired of waiting for his food, politely (overwhelmingly so)asked for a refund; the cashier huffed and puffed. Couple in front of us wanted wings, cashier says you don't want those because you'll have to wait. For some reason we still were waiting to order here. Cashier is all sassy and exasperated, just ignores the rest of the line. Finally we left, no sense in just standing around; probably a good thing we didn't eat there. If this is the level of professionalism in the front, imagine how bad the food safety is where you can't see?"}
{"text":"Sorry I went here for lunch. The place was deserted and it took them forever to assemble my meal. I had a 4 piece nashville hot meal. With a drink it was $14. Ouch. 

The chicken was so greasy. There was not enough hot sauce on it to actually flavor the meat. 
The mashed potatoes sucked. The gravy is so bland. The cole slaw didn't seem fresh. There was a lot of liquid at the bottom of the container. The biscuits were ok. 

Basically the chicken skin was super greasy, the meat tasted ok, but there wasn't enough hot sauce to actually make it taste like spicy chicken. It was overpriced. KFC really upcharges the nashville hot style meals. It's just some hot sauce and pickles. 

When it first came out last year, I tried it at a KFC that gave me hot, fresh, extra crispy pieces soaked in the hot sauce and it was delicious. Today was the third or fourth time I've had KFC Nashville hot chicken, and it's never been as good as the first time. I'm giving up on it.

I used to be a fan of KFC, but not so much anymore. Popeye's is usually better."}
{"text":"Demasiados clientes y pocos empleados,vivo cerca y frecuente pasa que te hacen esperar o no tienen lo que deseas,ordenas y dicen que se termino eso,cambias la eleccion y tampoco tienen y se molesto por le comente que me diera lo que tuviera."}
{"text":"Ah... KFC/Taco Bell.... as many times I've had bad experiences here, I keep coming back for your chicken and chalupas.  Most of my experiences here have been through the drive-thru.  One night I remember not being addressed at all and driving away hungry :(

It is your typical fast food place, so not really high on the expectations list, but basic service seems to suffer depending on who is working that night.  I do want to give them props for recently updating/renovating."}
{"text":"Aweful service. Black obese man claiming to be the manager literally kicked us out of the store 10 minutes BEFORE the store was supposed to close. He was rude, thoughtless, and should not be in the food service. Will never go to this location again."}
{"text":"Don't use the drive thru. It will take you less time to hatch, raise, butcher, and cook your own chicken than it will to get your food here. Better bring a stack of quarters, too because the sign on the window says you will pay 0.25 for extra condiments."}
{"text":"Normally I love KFC. I choose it over any other chicken drive thru. However the last time I went all of
My chicken was dry and overcooked. Won't stop me from going back and trying again."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place has terrible reviews.  My experience wasn't so bad.

I went through the drive through and the food was ready quickly.  

I enjoy the original recipe and feel that it's spiced well.

The only problem I had was that they got one of my sides incorrect.  I ordered mac&cheese and I got mashed potatoes.

Update: went back the next day (drive thru) and they didn't give me a receipt AND forgot my biscuit.  I'm not going back."}
{"text":"The workers were so happy and friendly (especially Sylvia) nd the chicken was fresh and hot! A great KFC, very pleased with the service and food."}
{"text":"I guess I can't write a stellar review of KFC since I really actually don't like KFC in general. Honestly I'm pretty sure their chicken is some mutated, deformed chicken raised to be torn apart and shoved in buckets.

However, my family loves KFC and I am subjected to it. I'm not against eating it, I just wouldn't do it without having someone else purchase it for me. Their chicken is meh, mac and cheese meh, coleslaw okay, and they really are lacking in their sides department. Is it just me or did they used to have more variety? I believe the last time I was there you could actually select a salad as a side, but apparently that is no longer an option.

The only thing I like at KFC is the mashed potatoes and gravy. Don't know why, but something about the salty balance really gets me.

This KFC is pretty well taken care of, service tends to be mediocre, but nice. It can get busy at dinner time for sure. Today we went there and my mother swore up and down she saw an advertisement for a special KFC was offering on TV and asked for that special. This particular store would not honor it, so I'm not sure what that's about.

In conclusion - no thanks KFC! I'll get my fried chicken fix elsewhere!"}
{"text":"This location is horrible. The food is never fast and they gave me hot sauce instead on catsup. Every time they mess something up, smh."}
{"text":"What a great price I really like KFC and the people that work here are awesome they helped us out answer questions waited patiently while we decided what to get. 
I'm definitely coming back to this KFC it's my favorite."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple times.  The food tastes fine, when we get it.  This location is super busy and really could use double the staff.

The lady taking the order is also scrambling to get the food.  There was only one cook.  One person at the window and that person also had to get the food.  I believe there were 4 people working at lunch time.  

The line was long.  The service itself wasn't bad.  Each person was totally scrambling to fill the orders and you could see how overworked they were.  They did have a HIRING sign posted, but whomever owns this KFC should probably pay more so they can get more people hired.

The lady at the register was very nice, but you could see she was a bit frazzled and doing her best.  They need to hire more people and if retention is a problem, then provide better pay and incentives to stay."}
{"text":"The food was fine.  However, there was no one in the restaurant but us after 9:00 pm.  We waited so long, probably near a half an hour to get chicken, hot wings, chicken pot pie, and chicken bites.  This cost about $23.  This seemed like a lot.

The place also wasn't super clean.

The guy that took our order had a really hard time with it.  Maybe he was new."}
{"text":"I am only giving two stars because I do not understand why I could only get extra crispy in dark meat..."}
{"text":"Ordered food to-go here on a Sunday and it was completely empty. Looks like this place was renovated, and not run down like some other locations. Maybe I haven't been to KFC in a while but holy, the price for their meals have gone way up! Ordered popcorn chicken box and 6 piece tenders and it was almost $20."}
{"text":"Don't understand the myriad of bad reviews. We get hot wings here every week, and they're great.
If you have to wait extra time for your order they give you extra wings or offer you a free soda while you wait.
I've been eating KFC since 1968 when they first opened on the square in Madison.
Always loved it, always will. The only thing better is Brown's Chicken, but alas none around here."}
{"text":"I have been an irregular customer at this location for over five years. Customer service hit or miss however most drive thru orders are incorrect. Today the incorrect food was passed thru my window once again. I tried to use the drive thru in the interest of time; only to once again be disappointed.  Ruby who I could not understand gave me not one thing I ordered correctly. I did however get chicken tenders and chicken wings however they came in the spicy Nashville flavor which was more expensive and not tasty at all. I will once again frequent the KFC on West Charleston until new management or new employees take their job seriously. This location is holding on by a thread. Please Management work on Customer Service and accuracy of orders. Check number 2739."}
{"text":"*FOOD POISONING/BACTERIAL INFECTION* Me and my girlfriend decided to come to KFC because we rarely do. We aren't overweight and we don't eat much fast food, but we have never experienced anything quite like this. 24 hours later we were both in Abrazo medical center at 10 O'clock at night. Along with being hooked up to IV's, we both experienced uncontrollable vomit and stool. The doctor took samples from both of us and it was a serious bacterial infection. It's not the service!!!!! it's the food preparation/sanitation/food quality!!!! SHUT YOUR DOORS"}
{"text":"This place gives a half of serving of mashed potatoes. Tried to talk to manager but she caught an attitude when I opened it up and said really? Then got rude talking about I was rude for saying really.....her name is Porscha. I am a grown man, I don't have time to argue especially a woman. Then you a manager so you want to argue with a customer when you or your team members are clearly shorting people on their food. Must be a way to save money on the mash potatoes????"}
{"text":"This place is the worst KFC ever, the manager Jose is a dumb manager.. he doesn't know anything about customer service at all, he couldn't switch two stupid sides just cuz of the pictures... dumb ass manager ever... please don't come to this place is not worth it..."}
{"text":"Warning! Cole slaw is currently SPOILED! Chicken is not what I'm used to from here. It has this weird chewy texture. YARLIN (shift manager) was not very helpful, but said, \"I don't like coleslaw\" okay, well instead of offering something else and dropping that attitude, I asked for my money back. I at least got that back. As you can see, KFC came to a nice area of Vegas and has employed some of the worst, giving them a 1.5 star average. Best is to take this unhealthy business out of SW."}
{"text":"Bunch of dumb lazy workers that take way longer than usual to complete an order and end up getting it wrong anyway... But hey what can you expect from 60 year old kfc workers in euclid"}
{"text":"I got a mashed potato bowl with voucher and got something for my friend. The other bowl I gave to my brother when I got home from the mall nearby. IT was so yummy! Beats the wraps I got at KFC in Toledo... best invention ever. So worth the carbs."}
{"text":"...only because you HAVE to give them a stupid star!!! So, initially, the girl working the drive thru was helpful and polite... it's a KFC, so that's really not that common. My order was taken quickly and without issues. I ordered a 20 piece hot wings and two large sides, simple. Get to the window and wait for at least 10 minutes while they do whatever it is that they do back there, just super freakin' slow. Finally get to the window, again, the girl was polite and professional and get my food. My food came out a lot quicker than the previous order. I drive the 4 miles back to my house, craving these hot wings and get home to find my two sides and some meal of \"baked\" chicken!!! I just want my hot wings!! I'm supe upset and this chicken is gross. Paid $20 for this awful meal. Never again will I venture out of my way for a KFC!!"}
{"text":"What in to get a bucket of chicken at 1st it was 10 minutes after waiting 10 minutes they came on told as it Would-be another 30 minutes horrible service places dirty they need to get new management"}
{"text":"Placed my order and paid for it and then got out to the car to check and discovered they gave me what they had.....not what I ordered.    So I went back in and was told that was all the chicken they had!   Seriously??? So don't tell me you can't fulfill an order just give me what you want!  Lovely.     Let's also shout out that they charge you for using a debit card.....I ask them to run it  as a credit card but they chose to run it as a debit and then charge me a dollar 39 for that service. So I asked why and they said well the machine doesn't let us choose whichever way we make more money. Calling the corporate store tomorrow to file a complaint"}
{"text":"I would suggest driving out of your way and go to a different one .My bean burrito was old and dry and the taco had no cheese I didn't ask them for a taco with no cheese .I knew that location was bad but I was hoping it changed .The taco bell on 67th and happyvalley is good and I regret not going there .This place is emply for a reason LOL!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was terrible. The employee in charge of the drive thru today was very rude. Sounded very unfriendly while taking order. When we got to the window, she shoved the food to us and shut the window. No words whatsoever."}
{"text":"Well, I ordered 20 piece of chickens to go tonight , that fat fuck doesn't bother to offer me any sauce, and drop my money on the floor ."}
{"text":"One of the worst KFC's I have ever eaten at! The chicken legs were the size of a pigeon. Everything was dry. And almost tasteless.  The potatoes were watery,  butter was rock hard.  I will never eat at this KFC again. The  Colonel would turn over in his grave.!!"}
{"text":"Was starving so I decided to try it. NO ONE was in the place sans an elderly couple just ahead of me. Long story short, one young lady was working her tail off while three other people behind the counter argued about who was going to fill the MASSIVE napkin holder that was empty. Save your money and sanity."}
{"text":"The Colonel is DEAD at this place!!' Chicken was very dry and overcooked!  Walked into the dining area and all the tables were dirty, trash receptacles were all full and overall this place was NOT clean at all. The floors were sticky and disgusting!!  Obviously the manager does NOT know how to manage this disgusting restaurant!  Employees certainly had a no care attitude!! And like the other reviews, our order didn't come out right either!!!PLEASE don't eat here!!"}
{"text":"Don't ever think of ordering chicken wings there, I have tried about six times and it's like begging for money. They have told me to call ten minutes before to order them and that has worked twice. I tried today and it's like their phone number is disconnected. I tried to order thru the window and they told me it would take nine minutes and that these are by order only. They should not advertise these at all then, what a hassle!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know what people are thinking when they give a company like this more than 2 stars. People who like this place probably get full from drinking a cup of water. I never thought the day would come when a McDonalds burger would fill me up more than the garbage they call a chicken burger at this place. The chicken deluxe burger is a tiny piece which you can finish in one bite. For 4.99 plus tax, I'd rather head down to A&W or McDs. The taste is nothing amazing. Bread, chicken lettuce, and gasp... Their newest twist... A teaspoon of salsa! Pure garbage."}
{"text":"Just went to this KFC and ordered \"2 Smokey mountain BBQ baskets\". The Hispanic lady didn't understand me so I repeated myself clearly, she said Okay. I asked, \"can I get it with just legs and thighs?\" she said, \"oh okay, just leg and thigh.\" I proceeded to get 2 drinks for me and my wife, and a large Mac n Cheese to share. I wasn't given a total, just pull up to the window. I gave her my card, got my food and left. When I get home, I open the bag to find 1 leg and 1 thigh basket! 

Just 1 basket?! and it doesn't even have all 3 pieces as it should?! Also, it came with just 1 side which initially angered me, but upon reviewing the website, this basket only comes with 1 side now. This ruined my dinner plans with my wife and if the drive wasn't a half hour away, I'd go back and speak with a manager about this. The person at the window needs to be able to clearly understand what is being ordered.

This is my first Yelp review ever - this angered me so much that I needed to speak my mind about it."}
{"text":"Came into KFC for some chicken---floor is soooooo wet the water is in puddles----no one in the store---temperature is 50 degrees---INSIDE!!! What----it's warmer outside at 8pm----no one here but super slow service!!! Unbelievable"}
{"text":"I never had too much trouble with this kfc until today. For starters the drive thru was incredibly long, going out into the already small parking lot which made it difficult for other traffic to get in and out. I was there probably around 7 so I get that it'll be busy since it's around dinner time, however I discovered that it was really because of the time it took to actually order and get my food.
It was incredibly frustrating to get my order through to the gentleman taking it, he had told me to wait a minute to start, which is fine! Once I started my order, it took him at least a few minutes to respond to me that he even put in what I ordered. I was starting to wonder if the speaker had broke or something cause after trying to say something numerous times there was still no response. I'd say it took at least 6 minutes just to get the order in. Never waited that long in a drive thru, ever. 
Once I got to the window, it was obvious that he was stressed and asked if I wanted anything to drink, I had told him that I didn't order any drinks and he told me \"You were waiting for a while, it's on the house\" and apologized so I definitely appreciated that gesture. He had expressed that apparently it was only him and the manager running things at the time, which is pretty ridiculous considering the fact it was around dinner time. I ended up feeling bad for him because the people behind me were clearly really frustrated since the customer 2 cars behind me were talking to the ones in the car behind me (rather loudly too) complaining about the wait.
Overall I wouldn't really recommend this restaurant, I got lucky this time with this guy cause he was pretty nice, but in the past I remember the employees having a little attitude which isn't usually appreciated from my standpoint."}
{"text":"Terrible. I tried to order a famous bowl, and the guy told me they didn't have anymore popcorn chicken, so I asked if he could just put a chicken tender in the bowl. Then I asked for a side of Mac n cheese and he didn't have that either because it would take 15 mins to cook. And then the cashier tried to explain it was only him and two other ppl on the shift blah blah blah  After I paid for bowl he then told me to park ahead and he would bring me the food cuz it takes another 8 mins to cook the one piece of tender I had wtf. I then waited over 15 mins and finally my husband went in side to see what the hold up was. When I received the food it was smother and gravy and was absolutely disgusting ."}
{"text":"Worst KFC experience ever!  Wish I could give negative stars.  Walked in yesterday to a screaming crazy male customer proceeded by an unresponsive ditzy blonde girl taking orders and a screaming crazy manager woman who thought it was ok to continue talking EXTREMELY loudly while on her cell phone the whole time.  I felt as if I had entered the Twilight Zone!!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service slow. Also I order the 8 piece meal only received 7 pieces, also I order Cole slaw they gave me corn??? The biscuits where cold did not taste fresh. Try to call and complain to the manager they will not answer.."}
{"text":"Shaundrayeauhhh is that proverbial black woman with a chip on her shoulder you see coming and try and run from at all costs.  You know the type - butts right in and rudely takes over the microphone from the person I was speaking to who I politely asked how the price would differ when ordering a \"$10 chicken share\" and adding sides versus ordering whatever \"meal\" that included the sides and similar number of tenders.  There was no need for an attitude Cheandrayuhuh.  KFC is a little proud of their offerings to start with but when my 9 year old begged me for this crap I caved.  Luckily I was able to leave and go elsewhere after I got a horrible attitude from Seanandreyus.  So I voted with my money and went to Bojangles.  Is it really any wonder how Chic-fil-a outperforms KFC by a LARGE MARGIN and they are even closed one day a week?  Ever gotten any attitude EVER at any Chic-fil-a?  I highly doubt it.  They don't hire bugaboos with attitudes there that I've ever seen.  After this unnecessary exchange with Seandrayuhuhhuh, and not being able to trust that the food I received would be edible, I left and went to Bojangles, and they happily accepted my money with absolutely zero attitude.  I also got 3 extra tenders, two extra biscuits and a half gallon of tea FOR LESS MONEY.  Keep up the good work and shitty attitude Sanandreaus.  I hope corporate is keeping their eye on you.  Clearly you deserve your own store and $15 an hour."}
{"text":"REAL disappointed in this location.  Had been a couple times to the buffet and came from downtown Charlotte for lunch 30+ minutes, easily passing 10 KFCs on my way to this location only to learn THEY NO LONGER HAVE THE BUFFET FROM 12-3.  I left and I won't be back."}
{"text":"i went thru the drive thru i ordered a zinger $5 box it was sooo good and freshly cooked!!!!! the customer service here is awesome!!"}
{"text":"Do not go there! worst $25.00 meal every had! they should not be serving food to public!
they need to close the that store NOW!"}
{"text":"waited 15 mins for wings, mash potatoes and gravy, because i waited they told me they upsized my sides, thanks, except they put macaroni and gravy and im sensitive to cheese... waste of a wait!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to this KFC the people are rude and obnoxious. Today I went up there and they were out of  potato wedges and corn and they took 14 min to cook biscuits. How do you run out of food  that is needed for half the menu? Last week I went up there I wanted order something and you hear people that work there yelling in the background and how I knew is I went up there to the window and you can hear a lady that was behind the counter yelling. Then I went up there a last month and I ordered three pieces of chicken strips with corn and green beans and I get home and find out that was regular chicken. So I had to go back up there to get what I ordered and a Gentleman up there was very rude to me even though he was the one that messed my order up. I believe the people up there need training on how they're supposed to treat people and how they're supposed to organize a restaurant. For a restaurant that's not that busy to be as slow as they are is ridiculous and for them to be out of stuff is also ridiculous. I also believe that the manager needs to go back to training on how to ensure that he has everything he needs for his restaurant instead of people wasting their time coming up there trying to get something that they want and they can't get it because you're not prepared. I would never recommend going to that restaurant because I certainly am not going there anymore. I gave them chance after chance. Not doing it again so they just lost another customer if you look at all the other reviews they're terrible about this KFC. If I could give less than one star I would."}
{"text":"Food is good, but service terrible. They have me a to go box when I was eating in. Did not get my cup until after the fact. I had to talk to someone else for it place not clean, at least the food is good. Service kinda ruined my meal"}
{"text":"This KFC  is by far the worst one that I have ever been into. I only gave it one star because there wasn't a NO star option. They need some serious training on what actual customer service is all about AND their food is horrible..."}
{"text":"Would never eat here again. This location served  uncooked chicken tenders. So unacceptable. When I called to complain the manager replied with a sarcastic 'Really?!' Completely disgusting!"}
{"text":"Biscuits were awesome. Chicken in original did the trick but was a bit disappointed that they don't have corn on the cob any more"}
{"text":"My soda was filled to the top with ice and barely even filled half way with soda. So upset can't even say anything. 

Also, when I got to the window he tried to charge me for someone else's order. He had no clue what I ordered and my order had never been entered into the system. I had to wait about 10 extra minutes at the drive-through window."}
{"text":"Burnt popcorn chicken.No mayonnaise,they said they ran out of Mayo.No sauces other than honey mustard.
The only thing edible in my order were the biscuits.

Remind me why are they open again?!?!"}
{"text":"Ordered an 8 piece bucket. When I got home I had 6 pieces and two of them were the tiniest pieces I'd ever seen. Smaller than the palm of my hand. The value has definitely gone down. The employees could be friendlier."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru last night for two of the 2Go cups (2.99). I ordered and was told I would get my total at the window, should have been approximately $6.49 (2.99+2.99+8.6%=6.49) however I was charged $9.72. When I questioned the price I was told \"yep that's the price\" but they couldn't give any explanation out side of 2.99 for the product and the rest is tax. They were also unable to produce an itemized receipt for me. I only received the credit card receipt. I call scam! DO NOT GO HERE!!!! Unfortunately, I have not had a good experience with ANY KFCs in many years. Lesson finally learned. I will NEVER go to another KFC ever again."}
{"text":"I seriously don't know why I continue to go to KFC. I thought not going for over a year, something would change for the better but I should've known better. I have NEVER had a good experience at this location. I honestly don't know how their doors are still open.....maybe bc the customers have to pay 0.25 for every packet of sauce.....I won't go back to this location ever again."}
{"text":"Holy crap, is this what has happened to all KFCs?  Because, if it is, I can understand why the brand is failing!  The chicken we got tasted worse than the greasy chicken you buy in the deli at your local grocery store!  It was disgusting!  I don't know if it was just this store or if it is corporate-wide, but it definitely turned me OFF of KFC FOREVER!  Gross!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to KFC in quite sometime.. Nothing spectacular.. Went through drive through, girl seemed rushed. Service was ok... Good was just ok..."}
{"text":"6/5/14
20 minute wait in drive-thru with no acknowledgement or empathy. Will go to church's down the street where they are better staffed. My break time is precious after all."}
{"text":"In some ways like all KFCs which would earn it 3 stars, but this one is much better than my home KFCs in WA.

Unlike KFCs I have visited recently, this one still makes food that tastes like KFCs of old. No low sodium gravy and chicken. This is the KFC food I grew up with. Yum yum... Eat in moderation... Also they allow substitution of sides on specials unlike my WA KFCs.

They did run out of original recipe when I was last there so I had to wait 10 minutes for my 7 piece dark meal order, but the food was piping hot and fresh when it came!

Friendly, fast service. KFC's online website has printable coupons nationwide BTW."}
{"text":"I went there on the drive home from work. I ordered a two piece of original chicken and was then told they didn't have original. I said crispy would be fine. I was told there was no crispy left. She offered spicy so I stated I would take the spicy. I was then informed they had just run out of the spicy and only had dark meat but would be the same price as the white meat. I pulled away stating this would be a good place to open an actual chicken restaurant. It seems it's the customer's fault they ran out of chicken at 6 pm on a Sunday. Will never go back. I suggest you don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"First: I *like* KFC. This is not a review of KFC; it's a review of the specific location at 4855 South Fort Apache Road in Las Vegas. 

Over the 9 years I've lived here, I've been to this location about 10 times. I actively avoid it. The service is poor on good days and almost laughable on days like today, when the following happened: 

I went to the drive-thru and ordered two Original Recipe breasts and coleslaw. I pulled to the window, where I paid and received change. Then, the cashier said, \"We don't have any Original Recipe. Is extra crispy OK?\" 

I replied \"no,\" at which time the cashier said, \"I'll be right back,\" and went to ask someone what to do. 

He returned and said, \"Grilled?\" (seriously, this is an exact transcription) I said, \"No.\"

After another consultation, the manager, Monica, came forward and said, \"Someone ordered all of the Original Recipe.\" What I needed to know was 'how long will it take?' but Monica didn't think to provide this information. She then said something incomprehensible having to do with their being four to a bag (?) and told me it would take 20 minutes. 

I asked for a refund, which I eventually received after much gnashing of teeth.

Seriously, worst KFC I've been to anywhere, and I've been to quite a few."}
{"text":"This location is joined with a taco bell. It's very small and I often see many people confused about where to order. The food is what you expect for the brand, I have no complaints there! The staff are mostly kids trying to get by, I feel sorry for them as a lot of homeless and cracked out people linger in there asking both customers and the staff for food. It's really awkward, and at times I've seen a homeless man ask for the food that was being sent back from a different order. He then took fries off someone's unattended tray and ate them outside. Their hours are very late but honestly once the sun goes down don't make an effort to eat here, you will just be bothered by others."}
{"text":"I  ordered 10 pieces of kentucky grilled chicken. They ran out of them and they advised me to wait 20 minutes. After i got my order, i went home and realized that my grilled were still not fully cooked. There was blood everywhere in the bucket..i dont know what wrong with this place. I will never come back to this store."}
{"text":"This is a review based primarily on the service received at this particular takeaway KFC, or lack thereof. 

Ordered a feast pack + 2 double down waffle sandwiches on Good Friday.  The feast pack was supposed to include a medium size popcorn chicken which was what my niece really wanted. The total amount came up to approximately $50.

I was not provided a receipt and in hindsight should have insisted on one. 

Once we got home we noticed our order was missing the popcorn chicken, and had a very disappointed niece. As it is a 15 min drive each way, it was not worth driving back at that time. 

We decided to phone the restaurant and the phone kept on ringing and ringing and ringing until it went to a voice message that did not allow for voice mail. Several of us tried calling for the next 1 hour and got the same result. 

Having worked in fast food industry as a teenager, I get that orders will get messed up from time to time, but please pick up the phone when your customers call.

Just remember to ask for your receipt before leaving the restaurant and be willing to drive back to the restaurant if your order gets messed up."}
{"text":"They have never once gotten my order right at this KFC. There is always sauce when I ask for none on a sandwich, the wrong dipping sauce for my strips, etc. Okay, maybe they did get my order correct once... But it was awful! Check out the pictures to see what I'm referring to."}
{"text":"When I got to the pickup window and paid, clerk said they didn't have Original and to pick crispy or grilled. Didn't he know this when I ordered?  Didn't he know this when I paid?  When I got home, box didn't contain what I'd ordered. Very in satisfying overall."}
{"text":"Got to love a Taco Bell KFC under the same roof. I'd eat here again.  Burrito supreme is the best"}
{"text":"The drive thru service was very slow.... like 30 minutes of very slow moving service. Looking inside the drive thru window, it seems they were massively understaffed. The floor inside was a mess and the people inside seemed to be waiting for a while too. With so many fast food options nearby I doubt I'll be returning to this location. Too slow for fast food."}
{"text":"Overcharged me about $2 wasn't worth going back since I was already home when I figured it out. Also an item was missing from my order. Guy at drive through was in a rush to get rid of me and acted put off when I scrambled to get my money together because he told me to pull up to the window for my total. I would mention him by name but my receipt has a females name on it. Terrible service thank goodness I don't go to KFC very often."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst KFC I have ever ate at...did not get what I ordered and the rude gal at the filthy window was inconvenienced when I ask for sauce to to with the chicken tender bucket for two (shorted three tenders).  I didn't realize I was shorted until I got home. I have tried to call all three NLV locations and the phones rang once then disconnected.  No receipt. Food was cold...never again"}
{"text":"Staff are polite. When i order no legs on a bucket deal, they always give it to me as long as they have it and I am deeply appreciative. The washroom is always out of toilet paper and in the summer the air condition is not strong enough in there. But other than that I have no complaints."}
{"text":"I am beginning to think my colleague and I are jinxed when it comes to the 2 of us going to lunch together.  Just went here to grab a quick bite - or so I though it was going to be quick.  

3 people working at this location.  1 person manning the register and trying to fill orders.  What the other 2 people were doing, I have no clue.  But they sure werent helping the lady out."}
{"text":"Horrible drive-through service lackluster attitude. Pretty sure this person would rather have been at the dentist than serving the food. Just looking through the drive-through window I see garbage on the floor including pickles and papers.  Sat in drive-through 10 minutes without even a warning that it would be that long.  The sad thing is is this is the second KFC we went to tonight because the first one didn't have biscuits. It's drive-through experience was even worse. They didn't feel like talking over the speaker for some reason. This one was just as bad with that though. I think I'm done with KFC."}
{"text":"Paid for my food, then told 90% of my food was a 10 minute wait, I got a sandwich and nuggets, then the cashier didn't speak English or understand the words buffalo sauce... worst service ever, ill stick to the east side location next time, even though I was just next door...... not to mention no tray liners.. not sure if these are clean or not... now when I got the sandwich it was all fat and I couldn't even bite into it, they remade it differently... I appreciate the effort but this has been horrible service overall..."}
{"text":"This is our second time at this location and the food has been bad both times. The service was nice. But the chicken sandwiches were SUPER dry. It's kind of amazing how a chicken place always has dry chicken. Time for a new location."}
{"text":"Ordered our food .. very friendly employee.  We ordered a la carte and the employee noticed we could get more food cheaper in a meal.    Appreciated that.   It is pricier than we would like but love the taste.   Wish their packaging was better.    Lost gravy and popcorn chicken when bag tilted in car ;("}
{"text":"The manager was so rude!  When I ordered they said it would be 5 minutes for the wedges I said ok and she was annoyed that I wanted to wait. The entire interaction was horrible. When I asked to speak to the manager she said it was her and I asked her why she was being so rude and she didn't apologize or say anything just took my money and closed the window. It was a very odd exchange. After waiting over 15 minutes another girl came out and was super friendly. I never got a receipt to do a survey so I wanted to do a review 
I will never go to that KFC again"}
{"text":"I normally wouldn't even leave a review on a fast food, but this branch on horizon and college sucks...i like kfc so I'd love to see them hire better people. 7:28 pm on January 12th 2017 this thin Caucasian lady in her mid 20s (Most likely) she had longer hair anyway while taking my order she forgot to ask what side i want, no big deal then when sje gave me my food, she forgot my popcorn chicken then made me wait 5 min b4 walking back 2 the window looking mad that i didn't just drive away. Then i told her she forgot my popcorn chicken. She didn't respond she just walked away for a couple min and came back with my popcorn chicken. I said thank you and may i have hot sauce, she didn't say sorry for forgetting or anything, she closed the window gave me the hot sauce then closed it again. I drove off irritated. Now i realize she didnt give me napkins, a straw, any dipping sauce, or a spork. She literally failed every part of her job, and seemed mad While doing it. I won't go back to this branch for a while...I'll drive further and go to a different one. Really hope you guys fix her attitude b4 you lose that branch."}
{"text":"Check your order before leaving the drive thru.  This is the second time this location has messed up.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Had gone through the drive thru, only orderd large mashed potato and small cole slaw. KFC could not even get that right. Get home with cole slaw and green beans....and they want $15.00 an hour."}
{"text":"Yes, they recently got crispy back !!
Been going here for the last 4-5 years.  Service has always been friendly.  
1 out of 10 times, they messed up the count in a bucket.  But it has not happened again, this was a few years back.

Toonie Tues is no longer $2,  its $3.29 !! 

Yes, the interior is dated. I wish they had indoor seating.  Lots of parking, a couple in the front and side, and more in the back.

Staff is friendly, which keeps me coming back.!!"}
{"text":"This KFC has great food and friendly staff each time I come in! However, service is pretty slow, even when it's not busy! But overall, great place!"}
{"text":"Is it possible to give a negative 5?! The employees are rude and if you don't triple check your ticket you will get home and find it all messed up"}
{"text":"So i have been waiting 30 mins for my food.  I have never seen something so ridiculous in my life.  I don't normally eat KFC and they just put a stamp on this crap!!! And then after all that time they gave me the wrong chicken.  You can't make this ish up!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't think this place is as bad as the hangry people have said.  I am here for the lunch rush and had food within 2 min.  $5 box left something to be desired for me even after upgrading to coleslaw and large drink... I devour food though.  Steady flow in the drive thru and at the inside counter.  Staff were typical fast food chain employees.  Petty much exactly what I expected from KFC.   

I can imagine the winter months are busier than other months due to winter bird migration."}
{"text":"A clean restaurant with friendly staff. For the first time in years I got a bucket of chicken with everything it was supposed to have. Other KFCs (in Champaign and Urbana) cheat. For instance, you get 5 thighs and 3 breasts instead of four each. You also are usually shorted another piece.
    This place does it right. I got my money's worth. It is the only KFC I will go to in the area. A smile and the right count of chicken goes a long way with me and it will you, too. Go here. You'll be satisfied."}
{"text":"It would be zero stars if that were an option. It was messy and the workers seem genuinely put out that customers came in to order. They charge 4-star restaurant prices as it is, but I was overtly cheated on the bucket of chicken I ordered. There was supposed to be 4 pieces each of breasts, wings, legs, and thighs. I asked just to be sure. I got 5 thighs and 3 breasts, which I'm sure is the policy at this KFC. I only got 15 of the sixteen pieces that I ordered, too (short a leg). I'd never go back, but if you do, unpack the bucket right there to be sure you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Second time going and never again.  This KFC is dirty in and out. The food is old and nasty. I couldn't eat the mashed potatoes because they tasted like corn. I think they used the dirty water from the corn to make them. Gross:(
The potatoes were watery and just blended with the gravy.  The chicken was dry and warm definitely not fresh.  They said it was the last piece of original. The biscuit was ok. The cookie was really good. Guess that deserves one star. Lol"}
{"text":"Seriously this is the worst KFC I've ever been to the worst customer service in fast food history last time I wanted lettuce they gave it to me ...but that time asked for extra side of mayo and they gave me crap and said we can't do it it even though I said u could charge me ...had to convince the kid just to give me mayo !!!second time asked for lettuce in my lil snacker sandwich and the girl said no she couldn't add it I told her they did it last time why can't u do it again she said she'll do it this time but not again !!!really ??? Fuck this place !!!and fuck KFC !!!how petty I'll find another chicken place or just hit up canes ...I use to hit up KFC all the time until they took lettuce out of the snacker but now u give me no other option to even add stuff for extra ...what poor service goin to call corporate !"}
{"text":"Gross! Coleslaw tasted rancid. Original recipe chicken was soggy and tasted like it was going bad as well.  Mashed potatoes and gravy saved my meal. Too bad. I like KFC. I'll have to drive a little further next time I'm craving KFC."}
{"text":"The customer service here is lousy. There is rarely a smile or a thank you. In fact, when I thanked the server at the drive thru window, she told me what I owed and ignored the thank you. On top of that, I've been wanting to try their chicken pot pie but every time I order it, they are out. The last time they told me there was a 35 minute wait. The food is borderline but I think I've tried this place for the last time. I would guess the cause is poor management and employees who have no desire to be there."}
{"text":"Ran out of corn, wraps, and grilled. I thought the first time was a fluke so here we are again in the same predicament. Not what I remember of this brand."}
{"text":"Food was cold , I used the drive threw!!!
Hey I'll never come back !!
The potato wedges felt like they sat for half a day.
Avoid this location"}
{"text":"Just left this place and it is 8:30pm. We ordered the 10 pc box combo that came with two sides. The lady who took our order was rude and acted like we were an inconvenience to her life. She only offered us the original style chicken. She then asked what two sides would we like when all she was going to offer was mash potatoes. With an attitude,She said that the mac and cheese was going to be another 15 minutes. We haven't ate the food yet but just like the service, I'm sure it's going to be sh*t"}
{"text":"Glad to see mashed potatoes comments at another store seemed to get heard. Because this store now does it also . Got my food fast .Sides  we're good but chicken was a little over cooked and dry . As I was eating I looked up the nutrition value of my meal and was blown away by how much sodium was in it . Would love to see them get the recipe wig a little less ."}
{"text":"KFC has gained my respect by selling a 2-piece chicken meal which includes a medium soda and one side for approximately $5.50. 
  In my opinion, the few employees working here did a commendable job serving a line of customers. They were fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of the Colonial. $5.72 for two pieces of chicken, a side of mashed potatoes and gravy, a biscuit, and medium Pepsi beverage keeps me a fan."}
{"text":"Horribly slow. Waited in the drive-through for 30 minutes. Would not recommend this place to anyone. Food quality wasnt that great and the service was rude."}
{"text":"KFC fail!!! Ordered the 8 piece meal for the Family and specifically requested hot sauce and honey at the drive thru window.  Got home and only 6 pieces in the bucket and no hot sauce or honey.  The meal says 2 breasts, 2 legs, 2 thighs, n 2 wings.  Meal had 3 legs and 3 thighs.... Called the manager David who was also the cashier.  The problem starts at the top I guess.  He sounded surprised they made a mistake. Its not hard to count to 8.  Thx for ruining our dinner.  Will not return. 6 pieces for $24.30 Really???"}
{"text":"poorest example of fast food ever. They are constantly out of items never have I been able to visit there and get an order placed quickly"}
{"text":"During placing our order I mentioned the exact coupon I had, at the window the associate gave me the total without the coupon, I handed her the coupon and payment and then she said \"oh yeah\" and took off the coupon. After receiving our order and asking for some KFC sauce and ranch she states \"I'm sorry we do not have any sauces\". \"They forgot to order them\". This should have been told prior to us placing our order. I then proceeded to check my order for accuracy since I've have a problem with this in the past and I was missing 4 biscuits. After waiting in the drive thru line waiting for the associate to look at the window and notice we were still there and open the window after a couple minutes I let her know we were missing 4 biscuits and she went and got them. I asked her who the manager was and she went to get an unenthusiastic girl whom I explained our upsetting experience with the fact 1st it should be told to the customer that you are out of all dipping sauce prior to placing an order to allow the customer to decide if they want to order fom the establishment not after the payment has already been taken from their credit card and then orders should be checked for accuracy by the establishment and missing items shouldn't happen as frequently as they do. The \"manager\" who could care less replied with \"well, they're supposed to tell you that so if they didn't sorry\" with a shoulder shrug followed by \"our general manager CJ didn't order any sauces\". This is by far the worst customer service I have EVER experienced ANYWHERE. This location is in major need of management changes and some staff education. I have given this location 3 chances as I believe mistakes can happen however we will be finding a new KFC location to give our business to if we decide to go back to KFC."}
{"text":"KFC. Central &Basline. Manager Don. Worst customer service ever acts like they have no coniments for you after you paid for your food.

Caution because the two Owners Do Not care how this manager Don treats people as Don said he is providing service to Low Class broke as customers any way who don't have an education anyway"}
{"text":"I have no complaints about the staff itself. They are usually friendly. They just seem to screw up my order every single time I come!

1. Ordered a Sprite and when I taste it it taste like carbonated water.#gross and I paid for that drink.
2. Ordered and 8pc that came along with 2 large sides. I ordered Cole slaw and wedges as the sides. When I get home all the pieces of chicken are there so are the wedges but I see MASHED POTATOES. Who said mashed potatoes??? Where did they get that from?

Food is descent staff is nice but the cannot get their orders together EVER! 

For kfc to be so expensive please get the darn order right! Be more efficient for a company that's been around for years!"}
{"text":"So it's KFC... fried chicken is what you get. That's what you came for. Really nothing else to say but Yelp would not me post as a comment. They said it was going to be labeled as a \"tip\" so I am taking up character spaces."}
{"text":"Worst meal I've ever had.  Yum brands needs to get rid of this. I grew up in Ohio and it was much better.
Mac cheese was processed food as was the mashed potatoes
Crispy chicken tenders were nothing like that at all.
Did not taste like chicken"}
{"text":"A joint Taco Bell and KFC! Needed to eat fast before class and I owed my bf money so ended up ordering around $23... Stopped myself before I ordered dessert!

We got a Big Crunch combo, cole slaw, small gravy, 5 hot wings, 2 beef taco combo with supreme fries... (Yes, almost everyday is cheat day) 

Wings were not crunchy or hot
soft tacos were average
supreme fries were soggy but the gravy was delicious as a dip to all the bad quality food. 

Service was good though. When you go just pray you get a freshly fried batch of fries and wings."}
{"text":"This branch is horrible. The worst. The lady working the counter literally refused my order by saying \"i have a lot of chicken to put out we're busy i can't help you\". WTF??!! 

My order package was also missing items which i discovered upon returning home."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this location in over a year because my order was always wrong. I gave it a chance last night. I waited in the drive through for 7 mins because the person in front of me order was wrong. Instead of having them pull in front because there was a line and bring there order out to them they sat at the window. when I finally made it to the window the guy didn't say sorry for your wait he just said your total is XXXX. I said usually you say sorry for the wait and your total is seeing ive been sitting here for 7 mins. He says ohhhh 7 mins. and takes my card. That was rude. He gave me my card back and said the guys order was wrong and we had to fix it. Not apologizing for the wait. Now I remember why I stopped going to KFC. Your order is never right and the service is horrible this is so disappointing."}
{"text":"Poorly ran and extremely dirty.  Grease coats every surface in the restaurant.  My daughter and I ate there the other night and as I was waiting for the food, I watched an employee open an oven door, while gloved, pick a piece of chicken out with her hand and then close the door again with the gloved hand. Bathroom is disgusting as well.  It wasn't too long ago that they nearly failed a health inspection."}
{"text":"This was the second most disgusting fast food restaurant I have ever been in. The entire place smelled like the inside of a port-a-potty.  The floors, counters, booths, garbage receptacles, and soda area looked like they hadn't been cleaned in months, including everything behind the counter.  The counter itself was sticky and had dried soda or iced tea on it, and it was not just a little spill, it was noticeable and had obviously been there a while. The staff  looked sloppy and completely unconcerned when I voiced my concerns, responding with nothing more than a blank stare. Needless to say, I walked out without ordering and will never return."}
{"text":"I'm the biggest sucker for any food commercial on tv. I saw the new KFC ad with both Georgia gold and Nashville hot chicken saw I had to go try it. I ordered both kinds as chicken on the bone, dark meat is my thing. The Georgia gold was sweeter and not very hot, maybe a 2 on a scale of 10 for hot. The Nashville hot has a pronounced cayenne pepper taste.  Still only a 4  on the same scale. And winner was the Nashville style. I will admit neither looks that great when you get it, but of course no meal looks like the commercial. Overall this KFC is relatively clean and has the usual frantic workers. I think it comes with the territory of low end fast food. I grew up eating a lot of KFC so I am immune to the downside."}
{"text":"This location never has enough chicken. I don't understand how a chicken restaurant never has chicken. I gave up hope on this KFC bc they never have what I go there to order and if they do, the food isn't up to par. Cold, uncooked chicken and the sides taste fresh from the freezer. If I can give this rating negative stars, I would."}
{"text":"Solid place! My young cashier was blasé but fast. Food was just as good as Moon's KFC.

Interior was dated but not dirty. I like to see it as kinda nostalgic. 

All in all, great establishment. Would go again!"}
{"text":"Combined with a Taco Bell which sours the appeal.

Staff wasn't welcoming, appeared to all be either high on meth or having severe existential crises.

That said, food was mediocre for a KFC. My extra crispy chicken felt not crispy enough and the coleslaw was barely cool. All in all, worth it but don't get your hopes up."}
{"text":"Original Chicken always good I'm giving this place 4 star for good Customer Service by AJ the Cashier who help me out KFC deals always good this is quick spot for kids meal when wife  to lazy to cook quick to go lunch is this spot."}
{"text":"Ugh. Dear Colonel Sanders. It's a shame your ghost can't come back and give the franchisee of this KFC location a good swift kick in the derriere. I walked in here and noted that the place was cleaner than most KFC's typically are. But a clean restaurant doesn't equal good food, or a good value either. When we opened up our takeout food it was woefully disappointing and underwhelming in terms of quantity and taste. 

I've stayed away from KFC restaurants for several years but when my wife said she wanted KFC, I went. I regret not telling her no. I flat refuse to go back to this KFC, and it will likely be many years if ever before I step foot in ANY KFC again. 

1 Star is 1 Star too many."}
{"text":"The workers here seem...incompetent?? They're all running around in the back with lots of shouting of what they need to complete an order. Only one girl seemed to be doing anything and yet there were like five people back there. One woman came in from the drive thru demanding a refund. The all stepped away from the front counter and scrambled to complete her order. She asked multiple times for a refund and
 they all ignored her while they frantically filled her order. After she left a lady with long blond hair said, \"her order was 20 dollars! I wasn't about to refund her money!\" Ithink that if the lady didn't want to wait any more on their slow service it was her choice. The service is slow 20 minutes to complete almost every order. We waited about 10 minutes for fries.... On another occasion we went and they told us that it was 20 minutes wait on all chicken orders... Which is all they serve at Kentucky Fried CHICKEN."}
{"text":"Much closer than Columbia or Asheboro zoo if you want to see the animals in their natural habitat."}
{"text":"Not overly impressed with our visit here. Only came for cole slaw but alas they were all out of cole slaw. So I decided to get 10 biscuits. They only had six. Well sheesh. What DO you have? The employee was friendly enough and we've been here before with no issues so I'll give them three stars and hope this isn't a trend."}
{"text":"If there was a lower rating I would use it. Went through the drive thru this afternoon to pick up an eight piece meal. I pulled up to the window paid with a credit card and was told to pull up five feet to get the food and a receipt. Very quickly the food came out and I was on my way. Got home placed the food in the fridge. Brought it out for supper and found that there was no receipt and the chicken was so badly burned it was not edible. My feeling was that I was an easy mark to pass off bad food going through the drive thru. Shame on KFC for allowing a franchise to operate using these types of business practices. If you need chicken this is probably not the place to get it."}
{"text":"I used the drive-thru. The employee that took my order, Jasmine, was patient and friendly. I agree with previous reviews that no or few napkins is a minus, but otherwise it was fast service and my order was correct. The biscuit and two piece combo was delicious."}
{"text":"We ordered the 2 piece meal for both of us, it was terrible! The leg looked like a baby chicken part and the thigh was actually the back. Plus we got charged a dollar extra for going thru the drive??. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Disgusting. I feel like they should have paid ME to eat there! The \"crispy\" chicken strips were definitely far from crispy and more like the crappy frozen chicken you pay a dollar for 50. We are regular KFC eaters and this branch seems like they do something COMPLETELY different than the rest! And it wasn't just one thing bad; every single item was TERRIBLE! YUCK!"}
{"text":"Well, my first time was typical mediocre KFC. An inoffensive, pressure-fried chicken meal.  Then I made the bold, yet stupid decision to dine here again. The results of my second experience can only be described as gastric distress probably due to the unsanitary conditions another reviewer mentioned. So, yeah, never again. Not this location. Because if I give them three strikes, it might end up in a stomach pumping."}
{"text":"Worst service i will never be back again i was waiting 35 minutes for my food it wasnt even busy i went through the drive thru and they tell me they ran out of popcorn chicken so we settled for chicken strips for my son my husband got the chicken wings but when we got to the window she told us to park up front because are food wasnt ready we waited 15 minutes befor the lady came out and told us they were out of chiken wings and their was nothing she can do for us but give us a refund next time we will be going to churchs this is the worst service that i have ever received they can also do with out the attitudes"}
{"text":"Extremely enjoyable. I only go through the drive through, As I only come through after work, and I have to say, this kfc is rather alright. The inside doesn't seem to be the greatest, but that's not what I'm reviewing. I'm here to speak on my experience, and the food. I use to work at burger king(for a year) and I know that the quality of food gets lesser as the night goes on. But I've never had that experience here. Food is extremely tasty, they always have what I need. Staff is usually young people when I come through, so the service isn't top notch, But that doesn't bother me. I enjoy the food, the wait is relatively minimal, and the food always tastes like I expect it to. A+ drive through service!"}
{"text":"2nd worst fast food experience of my life. 

At the drive thru menu, we ordered 2 Double-Downs and a 10piece boneless meal w/ mac n cheese and mashed potatoes (the cashier repeated our order back to us). Once we got to the window, we had to repeat our entire order for the cashier as if he didnt catch any of it the first time. I thought that was a red flag but took it as a sign that at least they wouldnt be messing up our order... NOPE!

We got home and opened our food only to realize that the mac n cheese our toddler had been begging for was switched out with cole slaw! As if that wasnt enough to irritate me, ALL of the chicken was way overcooked, dry, and tough... And since bad things come in 3's, it's only right that our double-downs were horrific too. I've had at least a dozen double-downs in my life and this was the only time I've ever seen KFC use what was basically 3\"x1\" chicken strips. Also, they were served without bacon.

I was STARVING when I ordered my food but had absolutely ZERO appetite when I got home and saw the food. I was so upset about my $35 order that I actually called them. I spoke with the shift leader and what was his solution to the problem?? Free food!! Why the hell would I want MORE of that \"food\"?!! Absolutely ridiculous.

And the icing on the cake? When my wife drove back to speak with someone in person, the place was closed!! The door said they close at 11pm... Ummmm, it was 10:15pm. Seriously?!! Corporate WILL be getting a phone call first thing in the morning."}
{"text":"My drive thru orders are always screwed up, especially tonight. Ordered 3 pieces grilled legs meal, opened the box there was 2 thighs, where's the other piece? And I said legs only no thighs. Comes with 2 green beans and they gave me one. The order taker had the audacity to tell me I took the last one. Ummm ok? Do you have the courtesy to tell me before I opened the box to check my order? Ordered a piece of breast, paid for it and came home with no breast. Tried to call the manager to complain and its a recorder. My whole order was screwed up and I paid full price. Go elsewhere for better services!"}
{"text":"How does the health department not close this place down. I've been here before when it was dirty but now it is amazingly filthy. I posted pictures of the men's bathroom. The grimiest door to get in, the urine all over the floor, the rusted out wall next to the urinal, the empty hand soap container which employees are required to wash their hands before returning to work. Just unbelievable."}
{"text":"After ordering an 8 piece chicken meal, waiting in drive thru for 20 minutes, AND being charged .39 cents for using a debit card, I think I am done.  The place that sells primarily CHICKEN, did not have chicken made.  To top it off, my toddler had an accident in his pants because I was STUCK IN DRIVE THRU!  If this was a Raising Caines, I would not have had such a poor experience!"}
{"text":"This KFC restaurant has been here for a very long time but we only frequented it once many years ago and it was not a good experience.  Today we decided to give it another try.  We were warmly greeted when we entered.  They young lady at the register was quick to take our order.  When we got our food everything was just as we ordered it.  While we were eating the same young woman who took our order came over and asked if everything was good.  We said yes.  Then as we were leaving she wished us a nice day.  That, is OUTSTANDING customer service!!!!  I wish I knew her name because she needs a raise!  Anyone representing your company at that level should be paid well.  Our food was good.  The biscuits were fluffy.  The chicken was juicy and crispy.  I ordered mashed potatoes and gravy as my side because I like to dip my biscuit in the gravy.  The portions filled my young adult sons.  They didn't walk away hungry.  I'm glad that we gave this place another try.  It was a very nice surprise."}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to drop in for lunch. This location is a combo-KFC and Taco Bell. Since it was lunch there was a line of people but the line moved quickly. The food was also ready very quickly. I ordered the $5 quesadilla box. It had a chicken quesadilla, a regular taco, a Dorito shell taco, and a drink for $5. I ate the two tacos and saved the quesadilla for dinner tonight. Both tacos had fresh, crisp taco shells and were filled with a nice portion of meat, cheese, and lettuce. 
While we were eating two different employees checked on me to make sure everything was good. I visited the bathroom and it was clean. There was a nice young woman who was cleaning the dining area. A lot of people don't like fast food restaurants because they can be dirty. This was one of the cleanest fast food place that I had been. Customer service was wonderful as well."}
{"text":"I'm working up here for a couple days. And a check up the KFC because of the one good review. Well I get my order paid for aside  and did not receive it. I think the detail  and service. Can make or break a business. 
The food was hot. The people who work there seem  to be pleasant. What I can see from the drive-through my experience is limited. The lack of not getting a side that I ordered make this a 2 Star visit."}
{"text":"Ran in to get a side of mashed potato with gravy. Total came to $4.31. I am totally ok with paying more for convenience. Then I saw $4.70 on my receipt. \"We charge more for debit card orders.\"  Wow, really?  I did not see a sign declaring that anywhere in the store.  Nor was I told before I hand over my card.  I am not happy for being blind-sided with extra charge.  40 cents is not a lot, but it adds up.  Plus, you will think they should at least mention it before they put it on the charge. It is for sure I will not go back."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had a very interesting experience at this KFC today. Even though it took a long time to place the order, once it was ready everything was ok.  My daughter had the pot pie and I had crispy chicken with sides and both were very good.  Halfway through our lunch 2 young man came into the restaurant and one of them was having a conversation with the shift manager.   She was busy and she did not stop working when she was talking to him.  Evidently he was an employee coming back for his last paycheck and the shift manager told him that because of his No call No Show this will be his last paycheck. I admire the shift manager being straightforward and told him what was the reason that he was let go but I am disappointed that the manager wasn't able to take him to the back office to do this in private (however I do understand when the lunch line is long and people are waiting to be served, you just couldn't step out to take care of business) Because the situation got slightly uncomfortable I told my daughter that once the guys leave and if they come back she was to let me know.  After couple bites they did come back.  I had no idea why these two young men came back so I told my daughter to get up from her seat and we proceeded to exit out the side door. I guess this was a little bit of intense and unsettling. I rather err on the safe side and even if that makes me a little bit paranoid I really don't care. I will have to say base on this experience I probably won't come back to this location just because the unpleasant experience we had."}
{"text":"They turned there lights off 19 minutes before they were supposed to close. They were out of biscuits, and unsure if they had what I ordered. I'm sorry, but if you don't close for 20 minutes, you should have everything. I work in the restaurant business, and if I get sat 2 minutes before close i'm there for at least another hour. Unprofessional and immature."}

My friend order the same thing,  # 10 3 piece  Aveall white original recipe 2 breast and 1 wing with double mashed potato/gravy.  One large Root Beer with ice,

I am very clearly speaking to the speaker box,    A number of occasions we double check and the food ordered is WRONG,  Just how hard is it to place all white 2 breast and I wing original. Once again  got 1 breast, 1 thigh and 1 wing,   On BOTH ORDERS"}
{"text":"As a KFC goes, this one is about the best you could ask for. Clean, bright, modern. Staff appears well-trained and food (was here for lunch) was cooked well.

Plenty of seating, wi-fi, and a self-serve soft drink area. Bright clear menus. 

A huge improvement from the nearby KFC at Mt. pleasant which looks like it hasn't been upgraded since the 70s. One can only hope this is the model all KFC's will aspire to going forward."}
{"text":"22 minutes for 2 burritos, fried & churros, appalling service!!!"}
{"text":"This KFC must be a rogue store or maybe it is not even a real KFC. I don't know. Fill Up Box advertised at $5.00...This store charges $5.25. Fill Up Box includes medium drink and picture of item on drive through menu shows it with a lemonade; however, there is an added charge for lemonade. Person at window asked if I wanted ice in my drink because there be be another extra charge. Cookie was also to be included...guess what... got home and there was no cookie. There are lots of choices in the area for chicken...All of them better than this KFC."}
{"text":"The customer service at this KFC is horrible from the front line to the manager. I waited 45 minutes for my order in drive through. There was only two cars in front of me. When I approached the window I was not acknowledge. The lady filling the soda dispenser just looked at me. Once someone did approach the window he eventually apologize for the wait. I did not get a receipt or anything. When I called to speak to the manager she offer me free piece of chicken and biscuit. No one had the number for customer service or corporate.  The manager wanted me to come back by 5:30 because she was leaving if I wanted the free chicken. I told her getting free food was not my point it was the point that had to wait so long. I will not be back to this KFC again."}
{"text":"Don't expect the order taker to try to save you money at this location! 

I ordered a bowl and small drink. Normally, a restaurant worker would say \"Allow me to save you some money by making this a combo. You'll save two dollars AND get a medium drink instead of a small AND a cookie\". This is the type of service that would bring me back to this restaurant! 

When I brought this to the employees attention, he made no attempt to make it right. He could have at least given me a cookie, which would have dramatically changed the tone of this review."}
{"text":"The worst KFC ever.  Special Tuesday takes almost half hour to get served. The worst customer customer service so disorganized. Its not rocket science, it's chicken and fries. I've given this place a few chances but always the service absolutely disappointing. They should jus have self service. The reason why I'm writing this review is because my wife went to get a 12 piece bucket and honestly we half cut little pieces of chicken. So upsetting, are they trying to save some money so they can afford the bad service."}
{"text":"10:02. Standing outside waiting for the door to be unlocked, manager in the phone inside watching us. Not good kfc, not good."}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst KFC I've experienced. Not only are they one of the few businesses left that charge a fee to use your debit card but they can't seem to get orders right. I've stopped by this one many times and am constantly surprised at the new ways they find to screw up the order. This trip in today will be my last at this store. A simple 2-piece dinner and, evidently, they can't count to 2. I got home and found only one piece of chicken in the box. The worker behind the counter never smiled and seemed to act as if he hated being there. From management on down this store is in serious need of extensive retraining or total replacement of personnel."}
{"text":"Update: I drove down to Durango and 215 to test their KFC today. Yup, I mean nope, KFC chicken is not supposed to be drenched in oil. It's just this location.
---------------------------


The service is good. Food came in less than 5 minutes and it was piping hot and fresh. I am not so sure the chicken is supposed to be so greasy though. I had a hankering for fried chicken. Normally I go to Church's. I don't remember KFC being so bland and so greasy. What happened to the Colonel's secret spices? Did Darrell Hammond steal it after getting canned for being an eerily weird Colonel Sanders, only to be replaced by a even sillier Norm McDonald version?

The biscuits were good. It didn't come with any honey or butter. The mashed potatoes were smooth and not lumpy. But the gravy was really runny. I ate KFC a few months ago and don't remember it tasting like this. Will go back to my old favorite."}
{"text":"Do not stop here!! If Yelp had a -5 I would rate it there. This is by far the worst service I've ever had at a fast food restaurant. I walked into the store for takeaway at 7:07pm on the 28th of October. Two people were in front of me and it then took 17 minutes to get served. The server repeatedly had issues taking my order. It then took another 26 mins to get my meal. We then left at 7:50pm. 43 Minutes to get a meal is horrible. I could have been to a sit down restaurant in this time. They thought they would be nice and give me a few extra items but it ended up making up for the missing side, missing sauce and cold chicken and wedges. As per my photos the place was dirty. If the owner reads this feel free to pull up the cameras to watch me wait for 43 minutes.  What was even worse 2 couples came in nearly 10 minutes after me and were given their meals 5-10+ minutes before me.  I will never be back!"}
{"text":"Horrible! The drive thru is just garbage! The lady didn't even ask what kind of chicken we wanted, and we sat in the drive thru for more than 20 mins! No wonder they have only 21/2 stars... They don't deserve even one from me! Why can't we give 0 stars?"}
{"text":"Went through drive thru an overweight rude guy helped us and was useless!!!  Didnt give us straws or the cookies with the fill up meals will not return to this dump!"}
{"text":"!!!DO NOT COME HERE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!If I could I'd give them half to no star. So I went during lunch time at work with 2 of my friends. It was 10:40 am. What I don't understand is why in God's name do you open without having the food ready? It's chicken. Churches & Popeyes always have their chicken ready before opening. I used to work for a Popeyes. They have large fryers guys. Timed fryers. Bone in chicken 25min, Tenders 6min Tops. Think about it. How long does it take you to fry chicken? Most of us don't own fryers & we take less time making it. But, these facts are beside the point. I drove up to ask for our small & stupid simple orders 1, done. 2, done. 3 can I have a chicken tenders meal please? We don't have tenders (10:40am) okay.. (my friend tries to find something else & she asks us if we're done yet) \"um.. no, we're looking for a substitute. Please give us a few more seconds.\" Its a ghost town. We are the only car & customers. I know why now. \"Okay then we'll have a chicken sandwich meal instead.\" We don't have that either. That falls under the tenders category.\" Wait a minute, wait a minute.. are you fucking kidding me? How is this place still in business? \"Okay.. ha-ha so what do you have?\" (Doing my best to be nice.) \"Bone-in chicken. Pot pies & bowls.\" (So he windes up getting bone in chicken. He doesn't even like bone in chicken but, we already wasted most of our lunch time so we take our food & leave. Come to find out, we're missing items from our meals. Fucking how?! It was just us! No one. No one else was behind us or in the restaurant guys! I don't understand.. I don't. I seriously only drove back to complain & the person answering the drive thru orders was fucking rude & lost. How dare you be so fucking rude? I nearly jumped out of my car window. I've said this before. People want to get paid $10 an hr for doing absolutely nothing. This is why you stupid bitches are getting replaced with kiosks. I called the manager but, damn. The bitch was just as stupid & useless. Do not come here. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY"}
{"text":"eat at your own risk. save your money. i intend to report this place to the health department. i should have known not to try it again because i was the only customer! the new owner is so cheap he has a sign telling people that the hot sauce is a quarter per pack. the chicken is definitely old and never cooked fresh - ever. in fact, it truly tastes as though it was cooked 1-2 days before and left under the heat lamps. not kidding. petrified chicken - no thanks"}
{"text":"Give KFC another chance. This place is different than the rest. They truly have tried to reinvent themselves and I approve. I don't even like fast food. 

Do yourself a favour and go here. It's how I imagine time travel to feel like. Something I once knew and cherished... Magically transformed into something new. Hesitant at first but gives it a try. Wonderfully surprised. Great Scott!

Dooooo it"}
{"text":"Avoid this location. My wife and I both ordered a meal that came with a cookie for desert. We got home and realized they didn't give us the Cooke. We returned since we were really feeling like desert and they said the were out and substituting a biscuit or side since they were out of cookies. We question how a biscuit is like a desert since we wanted something sweet and asked if instead of two cookies we could split a slice of pie. The manager quickly informed us that two cookies is $.99 and a pie is $1.99. I asked if she could just make the substitution since we had to drive all the way back and since it was their mistake to begin with and she refused. I just left because we didn't feel like more food, we wanted dessert. How is it that if you make a mistake and run out of desert and then just leave it out of the meal althogether you feel you don't have to substitute with something similar. What a waste of a trip. The one bright side was the person who helped us was very friendly. His name was William.  He should be promoted as I could tell he wanted to take care of us."}
{"text":"Well the services at this KFC wasn't to bad, but could be a bit better. But the bathrooms really...no seat covers or soap. Really how are you suppose to do your business when your about to eat or afterwards. The floors and counters filthy. But the food was delicious warm and juicy chicken cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Waited 8 minutes to even to be addressed. All were on phone in back of the place. I had to yell for help. And they have bad chicken."}
{"text":"place is so ghetto.  they just throw random chicken in your bag and consistently out of so much stuff.  on your way out there is always a homeless man with a sign rt after the drive thru window."}
{"text":"A regular chicken place and compared to popeyes, the only good thing about it its the location which is closer to where i live"}
{"text":"Well that will be the last time I go to KFC.
Did drive thru.... mistake took 15 mins... staff rude and not helpful.  Soda flat, chicken gross- go to Canes or Chick Fil A, they like customers and food is far better than what the Colonel is serving up!!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a quickie lunch. Wanted the chicken pot pie for $2.99. Oops I forgot my coupon. Asked if they had any. No, was the answer. I had to get the $5.00 fill-up, still a good deal, but I only wanted the pie.  Hesitant to go back there.  Hate when I have to cut out and remember to bring my coupons. I left it on my counter. I'm bad!!"}
{"text":"I was greeted by Laura and had the most heart felt experience in a fast food chain I have ever had. She learned my first name and helped me through every step of the process. Food came out hot and quick."}
{"text":"I wish there was an option of zero stars. The drive thru is a joke. Tonight i waited 45 minutes to get to the window and they gave me the wrong order. I asked for a sandwich but i got popcorn chicken in the bag. The guy in front of me just left without getting his order. That's how frustrated he was. I don't get it. Bunch of retards. No apologies for the wait either. I could see through the window that they were a total mess not knowing which order is what. I will never go to this location again"}
{"text":"*Update 10.28.2016*

Just got served by some kid(new, obviously), who ~whispered~, instead of actually speaking at a normal volume (I honestly needed a figgin' hearing aid to understand what he was saying)- who, once again mangled my order. Only this time, I actually inspected my order. As usual, I got the wrong items. I then told another employee what I ordered. Got the main item correct this time, but this other employee gave me the wrong sides.... Honestly KFC, what the frig is this?!? Do you honestly care that little about service or positive customer feedback???

Though, I'm partly to blame, for not following my previous advice, and making the drive to Alliante. Oh well. Live and learn. And go to PDQ next time to quench my chicken fix..."}
{"text":"This taco bell is the worst. I don't usually come here because the service time is so terrible. I figured it's been a while so I went in for 2 tacos. It took 10 minutes just to order, and another 10 just to receive the food. Don't come here unless your prepared to waste a ton of your time."}
{"text":"I try to be fair so I always give a place a second chance. Although my first experience was poor and my stomach lived to regret it I gave them another shot. Once again I purchased the basic, regular recipe, crispy 12 piece chicken bucket with 2 sides of slaw and biscuits...can't help it, I'm a boring old traditionalist! One would think that for such a basic order, it should have been perfect. The chicken was a rubbery, dry, smooshy mess with a darkish black tinge (from being reheated in dirty oil) to the coating. The coating was neither crispy or crunchy, it was mushy, soft and slid off in one greasy piece.The meat inside was dry and rubbery (old, freezer burned chicken!) and even the bones were blackened. It was truly disgusting and not really edible, my poor Pomeranian even gave me a strange look when I offered him some. I believe that the chicken had been put in the refrigerator and then brought out and reheated in the aforementioned dirty cooking oil because that is how it looked and tasted. Obviously someone is being lazy and cooking too much chicken and then not disposing of it once it has sat around for a few days. The slaw, usually my favorite, was soupy and loaded with vinegar. It resembled cabbage soup more than slaw and was soggy, not crunchy or crisp. I took one container and drained the excess \"soup\" from it and it was 3/4 cup of vinegar water. C'mon, slaw isn't rocket science nor does it take a long time to make..no excuse for old slaw! The biscuits - no surprise- were hard, dry and cold..another days old product that should have been thrown out instead of microwaved and boxed up. Pretty clear that no one working here cares about the food or the customers, no effort whatsoever and way over priced at $39.00! Talk about being robbed. When the food arrived home I called them and after several no answers (they weren't busy on a Thurday night - not enough to not answer the phone) someone answered and when I asked to speak to a manager was placed on hold and hung up on. When I called back there was no answer again. Even if they were giving this away free I wouldn't take it, I only ate a few bites and my stomach was definitely an unhappy camper that night as was my husband's....the dog is OK as he was smart enough to walk away! Good boy Maxx! So unless you see a sign that says \"UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT\" take a tip from Maxx and just keep on truckin'!"}
{"text":"This place never has food ready. Came in for 2 pot pies and they had none ready. Was told would be ready in 20 mins. Cant beleive they never have food ready. That explains why there were 4 cars in the parking lot and no one inside. All waitinf for food. Dont think ill be back"}
{"text":"I felt compelled to write a review even thought it has been many months since I've been there. Apparently grilled chicken is a slow mover as it has been old and dry every time I order it. I don't go there for chicken anymore.  One would think that corporate would have a rule for how long they can keep chicken in the warmer before sale."}
{"text":"I was going to go here just now to get food for my family. After reading these reviews, I don't want to waste my money. 
You guys should hire a cleaner, more professional staff"}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon we went to get a 20+ piece original meal. Which is not cheap. When we got home it was only legs and wings. Called them and they said they had run out of breast and theighs when we made our order. Really... Do you not think it would have been better to let me know. Insult to injury... apparently the chicken had been sitting out for sometime. It was dried out cold and greasy. Seriously nasty! Wendover Rd. Store in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I don't often eat at KFC... but when I do, I always choose this location. This is like the only KFC location that actually gives you white meat in your bucket of chicken. Other places I hear charge extra for white meat. Anyway the chicken here always is nice and crispy, not greasy and soggy like some other locations I've been to. The best part is, their staff here are really nice and fast. I mean I give them a coupon, and they give me more coupons! They're probably thinking that it's not much difference, but hey I wish I got that sorta treatment at McD's."}
{"text":"After multiple visits to this location, I can say that they are above average in their customer service. Staff turnover seems to be high, but I guess most fast food places have the same problem. Never had a problem with food quality or noticed any cleanliness issues when dining inside. Drive thru usually moves quickly."}
{"text":"Still a shit hole. Pathetic \"customer service\", dirty, slow and unorganized. Blind monkeys could do better. And they want $15/hr. Right."}
{"text":"I went to this location after flying in after a late night arrival. We went through the drive through at nearly 11 p.m and there were a few other cars in the drive through. Service was ok, and we moved through the line pretty quickly, but man... Is it me or is KFC going down the wayside for taste?? The taco bell was still the same horrible for me style that I love, and I'd come back for it, but the last couple times of KFC have been downright disappointing. The biscuit was hard and tasted funky, and the chicken itself was very gristly and just not that familiar flavor that kept me coming back. The prices seemed to be a bit higher too... I think I'll venture elsewhere for my late night cravings."}
{"text":"Wow... I must have gone in on a good day because the people working that shift were AMAZING!!! There was a line when we arrived on a Saturday afternoon and it moved right along. The girl at the register was fantastic and I'd give her props right here if I could remember her name. The manager on duty was on her game and the rest of the crew were moving along keeping everything smooth. 

I ordered the doublelicious sandwich, because let's face it... it's freakin amazing, and I know it's horrible for me, but in that moment I didn't care. YUM. Anywho, before I got my sandwich, she told us it'd be a bit of a wait. We were totally fine with that because she actually told us. When she did tell us, she gave us a free parfait because of the wait!! That was so nice! Plus it didn't take that long at all, I was thinking it'd be like 5-10 minutes or something since they gave me the parfait. 

It's really about the small things with me and customer service is a HUGE thing. What they did that day was just great to me, and if I didn't live so far away I'd try to get back there to enjoy the service again."}
{"text":"Just left this KFC, an I NEVER even knew bout this app, I don't do \"reviews\", BUT I learned BECUZ of the employee that helped me and my Mom! His name was Andrew and he's got to be the friendliest, yet most Professional Worker I've ever encountered, like EVER! We're from Indiana, just moved here almost 3yrs ago and he made it feel like we were back in our small \"HomeTown\"... Thnx Andrew!!!"}
{"text":"I drove to this location because I saw they had a promotion for $20.00 fill up. As I am ordering at the window and asked if I can get all grilled chicken as it was advertised either original, crispy or grilled chicken. The employee responds back by saying I'm sorry but this location does not carry grilled chicken. So I advise her that I need to drive to another location when the promotion stated i could choose grilled chicken. I was hungry after the gym and didn't even want to drive to another location. If this location does not offer grilled chicken then clearly on the drive thru menu should stated we do not offer grilled chicken. I feel that this does not provide good customer service."}
{"text":"We usually avoid this location because orders get messed up and rude staff, BUT we have been back here a couple of times in the last month and seems to have cleaned up there act. Food was fresh and staff were very nice. Janelle helped us and was very courteous. Actually had chicken and nothing was messed up on the order. Will be going back to this location. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Eat more chicken... lol
I have to say that normally I don't sit around and write reviews for KFC/ TB/ or any fast food chain, you know?

Me and some coworkers came here here and got a family meal. The young lady at the front counter was super awesome very polite and even through in some extras.

Ma chicken was fresh and delicious. Biscuits and honey are really good.
Overall the locations is very clean.
You can definitely know that you will walk out or eat in at this location very satisfied."}
{"text":"For some reason, I get a hankering for KFC about twice a year. This location is fair... OK service and OK food, but many times they are just not ready for me. One visit they told me there was no chicken for 30 minutes. Another visit I was informed, \"We are out of chicken.\" Call me crazy, but if you're KFC and you ran out of chicken, shouldn't you close the store until you can procure more chicken?"}
{"text":"Awful service!  The drive thru line always takes forever.  Today, there was no line.  We pulled up to order, started to order, and then were told to hang on.  We had to repeat our order several times, and it took 5 MINUTES from start to finish to order our meal for 2!  Then, we were given our food, and, while we were checking out food, the guy closed the window and walked away.  We found that they'd forgotten one of our sides, and they gave us 2 ranch dipping sauces for 12 tenders!!  We sat there for a couple of minutes and then my bf went in to correct the problem.  He came out and said there were several people waiting for food.  The food was actually very hot and fresh, but service like that is just unforgivable."}
{"text":"Last time we went to this KFC they forgot the sides.  They did it to us again on Sep 3rd. No fries, and no biscuits.  We have had issues with this particular KFC location before so from now on I think we will stick to El Pollo Loco if we want chicken.  EPL tends to get the order correct.

One other thing: the chicken is extremely salty, like dead sea salty.  Is that a KFC trend or just this location?  I am guessing KFC in general."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for almost 5 years now and have had really good customer service even though the place was run down either way it's where I went for my taco bell craving which always ended in some sort of shame spiral. They recently switched most of the ridiculously overpriced KFC FRESH branded stuff out for regular kfc/taco bell offerings. Honestly what can you expect from a kfc/taco bell store aside from the same food and lackluster atmosphere however, it was remodeled recently almost like the new mcdonalds in the vicinity and I was impressed.

It has less comfortable seating than before and the flow is a bit unusual since it has you cutting across a main aisle where people are eating or where people put strollers. Their new commitment to reduce and eliminate artificial colors/flavors really does have an impact on taste and quality. Also, the inclusion of a Pepsi mix fountain is a real treat, since I haven't seen one since going to the states. In short, I like these new changes it can go a long way into rebuilding this most damaged of recognized brands.

For those complaining about pricing, get a $5.49 build your own box and you will always save a good deal of money"}
{"text":"Great service by friendly folks every time! And if something is incorrect, they fix it quickly and politely. These are great folks and I have never been disappointed by them."}
{"text":"Stopped in after back to back basketball games to feed 9 hungry mouths. Maria Defante was awesome! So helpful and friendly. We will be back. Thank you MARIA!"}
{"text":"I have never had bad chicken until yesterday. Ordered a 8 piece dinner and the chicken was like they took it out to soon. It was like mush. Not crispy at all. Do not to this KFC. I should have checked here first. Wrost meal EVER!"}
{"text":"Worse service ever!!  The workers there got our orders wrong!  The girl taking my order never put in my cookies I ordered. She didn't apologize or anything!! They couldn't figure out how to give a large fry as a side on my friends order and told him he would have to pick another side and by the fries separate!!  So dumb!!!  Will never go back to that place!!"}
{"text":"KFC is a great fast food joint. The food is exactly what you would expect: greasy, heavy, not very fresh. Service is mediocre at best, probably the slowest drive thru I've been in and even when you go inside, there's a 10 minute wait and staff move very slowly."}
{"text":"If it allowed me to do negative stars, it would be a -5. This is the FOURTH time I have been here and have came home without my full order. And then this time I try to call the restaurant to get the problem resolved and 5 times the phone hangs up because no one answered for so long it times out. This is absolutely ridiculous they are basically stealing my money. I called corporate and they weren't any help either the guys just said hed send a letter and they would get back to me in a few days. Wtf kind of business is this, I cannot believe they are still open. I will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Avoid this location at all cost. It's a waste of money in comparison to other kfc branches, as the chicken sizes are random and questionable. Not sure if this is a chicken supplier issue or an internal issue at this location. It's almost like they randomly chop bigger pieces into two. One piece can have lots of breast meat and another will be all bones. Its bizarre."}
{"text":"It's been years since I've been to a KFC, and it will be awhile before my return. The restaurant was clean and the staff friendly, but I paid $7.00 for wings that just weren't that good and to top it off I was responsible for applying my own \"sauce\" to the wings."}
{"text":"The last few times I've been here, they've been out of chicken at like 7:30 pm. You're a chicken place! How the hell are you out of chicken strips, fried chicken, grilled chicken. Your night time employees are rude and lazy. We ended up leaving since they pretty much didn't want to service us."}
{"text":"Ehh made the mistake of going here. They don't have grilled chicken breasts there. Apparently only Craig and rancho does according to the cashier. They were too out of biscuits. We went at 7:30 PM. Oh and we ordered a cole slaw. The lid wasn't put on all the way so when we got home, the cole slaw had leaked all over our bag of food."}
{"text":"Decided to try a different KFC. This one too was out of chicken at 6:45 pm. It was a 12 minute wait for grilled chicken and 7 minute wait on the corn. The squirrelly looking manager doesn't know how to run a business. He rudely came up to the cashier and told him to stop taking orders. He walked past him and said something smart to him again. Will not be coming back here. Learn how to run a business and fire the night time manager. How dare he talk like that to employees. I finally got my food 17 minutes later. They gave me coleslaw instead of the wedges i asked for which took another 5 minutes."}
{"text":"I'm leaving one star because that's the minimum I can leave. KFC at this location has lost my business. I don't carry cash, like most people this day in age, and to ask me to pay $.39 to use a debit card is bad business. When asked about the policy I asked to see a manager and was confronted by 3 employees that only recited, \"It's policy\". 

You are greedy and asking me to pay the cost of operating your business with nothing in return. 

Goodbye KFC.

If for some reason you change this policy please leave a comment and I may try you again."}
{"text":"I have three things to say about KFC...1. They have the best F'ing coleslaw ever....2.Its total bs that they charge 25 cents extra for each dipping sauce for my chicken strips..TOTAL BS!...3.almost everytime i eat this i get a reaction from it but man i love it as im eating it....

KFC is a heart attacking waiting to happen but at least you will go with a greasy mouth....and a smile"}
{"text":"I don't know who it was. But the queen working tonight 4/5/18 literally killed the service! Was so genuine & was the nicest lady ever"}
{"text":"I'm craving the Chicken Little sandwich with the pickle and mayo. Went through drive-thru. Took five minutes to reach the loudspeaker menu. Placed my order: Famous Bowl and Chicken Little sandwich. Order was received. Waited another ten minutes to reach the window. \"We're out of sandwiches, so I have you down for the famous bowl, you good with that?\" So here I am looking at the guy, then looking at the exit, then looking at him, then looking at the exit .. \"Yeah, fine.\" I made payment, got the bowl, then drove all the way down to the KFC near 24th St to order just a Chicken Little.

Don't screw me over when I'm craving a thing.

Incidentally, the bowl they handed me didn't come with a spork (nor a spoon, nor a fork). They expected me to eat a bowl full of gravy and corn and potatoes with my fingers!"}
{"text":"Only giving 1 star because it makes me. Went to get kids some popcorn chicken for dinner. Drive thru told me it would take about 3 1/2 mins and asked me to pull up front.  I pulled by the front door. After 13 mins I went in to check on my order. Guy comes over and said he was \"sorry they were busy\". I said \"busy\"?? I've seen one car and one person walk in since I ordered. You aren't busy you forgot. Just apologize and say you forgot then feed me a line of BS. Can't wait for Chick-Fila to open!!!"}
{"text":"Waited at the counter for 10 minutes to get served as they cleaned up they didn't acknowledge me. Finally came to counter and I asked for the Buffet (8:29pm) and was told it was closed. I few items missing but overall a full buffet. A customer asking to buy food and you turn them away??? Maybe the trash can will get to eat it. So I left and went down the road to Bojangles and had a great experience!! The one on the other side of 521...very friendly and great food"}
{"text":"This time the service is a bit faster, but still slower than other fast food restaurants. But what irritated me is that leftover garbage on meal trays were shoved into the garbage bin and those meal trays that touched the garbage bin were brought back to the kitchen for immediate reuse without cleaning. Very disgusting and unsanitary"}
{"text":"Definitely need new management! Been waiting 20 minutes just to order and nobody is in either line. Just being ignored. Honestly it's a game of if we will ever get served at this point. 

The machine was out of soda, the tea came out of the dispenser like honey and I am in fear of food poisoning."}
{"text":"KF-what? I've been here twice and both times they didn't have chicken. The first time I get it it was like 10 minutes before they closed but the second time it was like 1.5 hours before closing time and they had no chicken tenders and they had popcorn chicken but no bowls to put them in so they still wouldn't serve it. Steer clear of this place."}
{"text":"I came craving a chicken pot pie and they were out of pot pies.  Next we ordered chicken and strawberry lemonade and they didn't have strawberry lemonade either.  This is the 2nd time ordering pot pies and they were out.  Unacceptable!!!"}
{"text":"For some reason, I've had the craving for a breast meal and Chicken Littles twice this week. (Mac and Cheese and Slaw too.)

I only really use the drive thru.   This restaurant is OLD ....seems like it may be as old as the early 1980s or so.  

Food always comes out the window pretty good...and has the standard KFC brand flavor.  Never have a bad food item there.

NOW,  the last two times i went there, i have been approached in my car by some panhandlers roaming the lot.... so LOCK YOUR DOORS.  Thank God that the KFC staff is aware of this and runs them off....however, the last time that they tried to run one off....i thought that there was gonna be a throw down or a shoot out.  The police were called....but i didnt stick around to see what happened.  It was time to jet.

I'll continue to visit simply because its close to home and i like it better than Bojangles."}
{"text":"Do NOT eat here!!  I agree with the first post.   I went two weeks ago and the inside of my cup had brown soot or dirt all over it.  When I called in to let them know, they didn't even care.  I will never eat at KFC again after that.  I'm actually sorry I ever even ate there."}
{"text":"Travis the cashier is such a sweet guy! He made the experience very nice. He's very friendly and was very helpful! Food was very hot and fresh too. Great experience! Travis deserves many praises!"}
{"text":"I rarely ever go to KFC and today I realized why! I went to this location today since it is close to the nursing home my mother lives at and she loves mashed potatoes and gravy.

I have only been to KFC twice in the last five years and both times I couldn't believe how bad this chain has gotten! When I was a kid in the 1970s and 1980s, they had really good chicken! Now, I wonder how they are still in business.

Today I ordered two fill-up boxes with three chicken tenders each for my mother and I. When I got to my mother's home and starting eating about 5 minutes after I picked up the food, I found the tenders were not warm and were hard. I bit into one and had to use both hands to try and tear a piece of meat from it. My mother is older and couldn't eat any of hers. The biscuits were not warm and were kind of hard as well. The only thing that was good in the order was the mashed potatoes and gravy.

I would advise avoiding this or any other KFC! Popeyes, Bush's, Slims Chicken and Raising Canes are all better!"}
{"text":"Not the best place to go for fried chicken, I usually go to Churches chicken but thought I should give kfc a try and this was probably the last time I ever eat kfc again. This place was dirty the customer service was bad, I couldn't even switch out my mash patatatoes for something else like I would anywhere else. They actually wanted me to buy them separate, you can tell they don't care about the customer."}
{"text":"This location is sorely lacking. 90% of the time I come here they are either out of chicken pot pies and/or they're completely out of original recipe chicken or chicken in general. Last time I went here they wasted our time and had us pull up to the window only to tell us that the cook was apparently out sick and they had no chicken and only popcorn chicken. They had nothing on the board or anywhere to signify this, nor did the person working immediately tell us while we were trying to place our order. I get really tired of coming here only for them to be consistently out of food. It's not even that I come before close. I'll come anywhere between 4-6 pm and they'll still be out of stuff! I love their food but it's just getting really old that they never seem to have enough food to meet daily demand which is ridiculous to me. Especially since I drive to this location instead of the one right by our house because the chicken is far better at this location. But what's the point if they don't even have chicken? Call ahead at this location if you want any sort of chicken like 99.9% of the people who come to KFC to get food."}
{"text":"been sitting here for 35 minutes waiting for chicken Littles. didn't have enough food to complete my 8 piece crispy bucket so I said I would take regular breasts instead but was given burnt wings. they didn't have Mac and cheese or chicken strips. the other 5 people behind me didn't get what they ordered either"}
{"text":"Is it just me, or does anyone else feel like a PoS when going thru the drive thru? It's like if I walk into the place, I get to look at the person face-2-face not just talk into some awkward box.

My new \"craving\" that seems to make sense (at least in my mind) is with the new Tennessee Heat on a chicken little (sandwich with a small white meat cut with some mayo on 2 small pieces of bread)! Woah it's greasy, my god it's tasty,  and oh lawrd it's in no way shape or form healthy!

They did have exceptional service actually. The staff as very nice to me and were quick with my order, granted I wasn't there during rush hours. 

It's a decently clean spot, interior furniture looking worn n tired. It's right next to Frys as well.

{"text":"visited this location recently- had a horrible experience- Sent an email off to head office- no one has answered me yet about it and also made a notation on the Taco bell Canada Facebook Page and no one has responded.  so bad customer service from both ends.  Don't waste your time or your money."}
{"text":"Located off the 215, you can't miss it. I do like the staff which was friendly when I walked in the door. 

Bathroom needed to be cleaned but the good was good"}
{"text":"This place is trash.  The tables are all dirty... There is 4 people inside waiting for their food for over 15 mins.  All the employees look like they are on drugs and not caring about anything.  We will never be back to this location... Pathetic."}
{"text":"Rude Manager name Brittney! The chicken we just purchased about an hour ago smelled spoiled and had a funny taste to it! We called the store to report it and she said she was the manager. Wow. If that true, I feel sorry for the Franchise Owner. We had to call corporate to get help. She kept cutting me off as I talked and basically acted as if I didn't spend my hard working money on this disgusting meal. She offered no resolution and was extremely argumentative and condescending. The most negative Manager they could have given a title to. They get zero stars from us."}
{"text":"I've been to this location dozens of time, their consistency is not there. This time both orders of chicken were dry, otherwise standard kfc."}
{"text":"Ordering the food was pretty easy and straight forward. After I ordered I waited for 15 minutes before I had to get up and ask what was going on. After that it still took 10 minutes to get my order. They got my order wrong twice. The manager did nothing about it. She was a middle aged latina woman. The food was good, both worth waiting for half an hour though."}
{"text":"We ate here last night and everything was perfect. Excellent customer service, food and spotlessly clean."}
{"text":"You're at KFC, let's not get high and mighty rating the quality of the food. 5 stars for he customer service here though. They are cheerful and friendly. Can't ask for much more!"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst managers that i have encountered. We we're charge twice for a drive thru last Sunday. Today we went back to have it corrected/ reversed but the manager he's name is Mohammed started to become agitated and raised he's voice towards us. And said it is not he's problem and we should go to the bank and let the bank take care of it. As we we're walking out another customer had the same experience with the manager and she heard the manager raising his voice towards an associate. This kind of behavior is unbecoming of a manager. Rude behavior and raising of one's voice towards customers and associates. These kinds of people gives KFC a bad name."}
{"text":"No wonder why the have a low score.  I never eat fast food so I decided to try this place today when I asked for the size of the item I was ordering meaning I told her is it enough food the cashier that had allready nasty attitude got even nastier. Good lord I walk out I don't need to give this people my biz or money for that matter."}

The manager /owner had an attitude about it with me when I notified her of this incident!  They will be reported to the health department ! Please beware!  This is serious as you can become sick ingesting such nastiness"}
{"text":"It is currently 10:17pm and the website says the restaurant closes at 11pm. It isn't open. 

The client service here needs work. They are slow and always out of something."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. I'm usually not the type to review but my last experience here is the reason why I'm so inclined to. Right off the bat, the employee forgot to give us out drinks. Our order that was given to us was not what we ordered so we went up and asked if that was our order. Reassured by the employee, we began eating. In actuality, it was someone else's order and the employee then began to take the food off of our table for THEIR mistake. Then, we STILL had to ask for the fries that they forgot to give us after making a scene in front of all the customers by taking away our food. They then took out receipt away from us and we had to ask for it back just so we could call the manager and complain for ourselves. Ruined kfc for me. That's definitely the fastest way to lose customers. Do yourselves a favor and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Not bad, they dont always have what you want for chicken kinds but they make it work with others if you arent too picky. its always hot the 5 times ive been."}
{"text":"Today was about the fourth time we went there and they didn't have chicken! We even asked the cashier before paying if they had crispy breasts ready and she assured us they did. Then while we were waiting she came and said I lied we don't have them. We gave them to a drive through customer instead. So we got a refund and left but got stuck buying a 1.79 drunk which we would not have gotten if they did not have chicken!"}
{"text":"Always good, always seem like fried with new oil.  I can't say how much I appreciated with this location when u had visit other KFC that gave u rubbish.

I only order drive thru, they are consistently have 97+ sanitation score.  Cashiers always smile and friendly.

Great location."}
{"text":"So, decided to go and get an 8pc meal for the family at the Losee location in north Las Vegas, you know its Sunday, don't feel like cooking, and was actually craving KFC. Well, I guess NOT! I went into this location at 4:45pm, the restaurant looked kind of empty with only one customer sitting down and I did not see any of the employees either. 
I thought they were busy in the back as I did not get any help until maybe a few minutes of just standing there. Finally someone came up to the counter, looks at me and says...\"Hey, we don't have any chicken\". Ahhh, what? no chicken? I was confused since its KFC!!! he says, yup no crunchy, no original, no popcorn chicken, but my manager should be coming in 30 minutes.
Ahh, ok, that does nothing for me, are they serious, no chicken at KFC? seriously un-acceptable!!! 
So its evident that im not happy, next time have some chicken to sell KFC!!! Im not a happy customer! will I be back...what do you think! ....yes I will. LOL! still not happy though!"}
{"text":"Okay - so I came back to this location after my fella insisted and since he was buying - alright sold! So let's cut to the chase - the food still was just okay. At least it was hot this time. So why the 5 stars? The amazing customer service I witnessed. Here it goes:

The place seemed very understaffed and everyone was super busy. Despite this the manager on duty (I think) was still dedicated to cross-training every employee - she had the cook take our order and was super good about how to treat someone who is still in the learning phase.

Then an elderly man came in and he walked with a cane. This employee took his order and pretty much verified everything to his exact specifications (this piece? this piece?). Then she got up from behind the counter and helped him get his sodas in order (brought the straws and tops to him) and THEN carried them to his car!! The whole time she never seemed rushed or discouraged even though she probably had 100 other things to do. I have never been so impressed with customer service in the fast food industry and this woman deserves all the credit. She went above and beyond what her job description (and most likely pay grade) entails and that is 5 stars in my book."}
{"text":"So, I am here at kfc as I write this yelp post, I am unhappy! Bc, When I came in the cashier suggested the New Nashville hot chicken fingers and for some reason I said sure. I paid and took my order to the table and proceeded to eat. My first bite on one of the chicken finger, felt of dissatisfied, the chicken is very salty. I could not eat it so I took it back to the cashier to get it replaced. She proceeded to go to the office and asked the manager or someone that is in charge. Well, it is close enough I can hear her not so happy that I gaved back her F food and I wanted to exchange it. She tell the cashier to give me 3 regular chx finger. And I said NO, I want chicken wings instead of the fingers. For some reason she is giving the cashier a hard time and I finally said out loud I wanted the chicken wings. Anyways bad over priced food and bad service. I'm not coming back, two stars is generous!!! It's too bad I used to like eating here."}
{"text":"If there was a way not to leave any stars that is what this location deserves! The staff is rude (including any manager and the owner), food is gross, and the place is always filthy. Do your self a favor and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"This is a clean, friendly fast food store to get your chicken fix.  Don't forget those fabulous biscuits that every restaurant in the south can make and none in the north have mastered...  except KFC.

Don't compare it to a dining experience - compare it to the burger options and it comes out just fine.

Clean, fresh, fast, friendly.  This location delivers."}
{"text":"I very rarely come to KFC or Taco Bell and every time I come, I remember why it's been so long since my previous trip. 

On this particular occasion the burritos were the safest bet, the popcorn chicken was mostly batter, and what chicken was in there didn't look too appealing. 

I'll give them an extra star because it came out quick and hot and everything I ordered was in the bag. I had my doubts at the speaker that it was gonna be correct in the end believe me."}
{"text":"This is the worst managed KFC. At 830 I tried to order chicken at KFC. Was told by a very rude cashier and when I ordered chicken his response was were not selling chicken only Taco Bell. This is the third time trying to order chicken and the third time I'm told they don't have chicken. KFC should really look at the store on union hills and 91st ave.   I never leave these post but three times."}
{"text":"Just there at 1:46 PM to pick up a 20 piece of Hot Wings.
Although the cashier was pleasant when taking our order- I can say that was the only thing that was good about the experience!
When we got up to the window & our food was literally being handed to us \" right after\" I paid. I knew our meal wasn't going to be fresh. Got home & there was not just wings in the box but also \"parts\" of deformed chicken wings ( 1/2 bone pieces/ parts with a little meat on them). So, we didn't really have a 20 piece when you count up the pieces & parts! 
Temp of food was less than luke warm, could tell product sat awhile under the lamps for sometime. 
Wings were extremely small for the $16 plus dollars we spent. 
Disappointing : Won't be back!!"}
{"text":"What a joke. 13 minute wait for chicken .  What does the C stand for? Chicken? No!   Convenient? No! You need to know there will be a rush every night around 6. I guess that's news to you. Be prepared! 

The manager Andrea was apologetic, but dang no excuse! Most of the staff at like they are on drugs"}
{"text":"Don't know why this store stays open.  I gave it 4 tries for chicken wings.  They never have them.  The last time (which IS the last time) Me and several walk in customers couldn't even get anyone to take our order.  They were serving the people at the drive thru, and totally ignoring all of us at the counter.  I waited 17 minutes and left before I got any madder.  It's a shame because this KFC is close to my house.  Thank God they opened a Church's a block away!  Bye Bye KFC"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 I would. It is probably the worst KFC we have ever been to. I know better than to try to come here (hence why we only try once a year). Every time it's the same shitty service and they are always out of chicken!!!!!!! Who has a KFC and runs out of chicken! Every time! This time we sat at the speaker (no joke) for 15 minutes. I would have left but there were cars I front and behind us. I get to the window and ask her is your speaker broken? She said ma'am this is not my store. I'm about to walk out of here myself! I can't take this location lmao! Then I ask... do you guys have chicken. She said we have a few left in the back! Oh my gawd WTF!!! I said I hope you enjoy your day girlfriend. It we are not ordering. Lord Jesus shut this location down! Rant over"}
{"text":"Slowest drive through EVER... still waiting for food as I write this. Hopefully the food is amazing but, I'm not holding much hope in that regard, either....
UPDATE;
Severely under staffed. Managment should fix this. Someone in the line, behind me, got out of their car to see what we were all waiting for.  There was no one to be seen..: wonder if the ONE person we did see. Later, was the only person working. Probably, overworked. 
Left line.. no food have up"}
{"text":"Andrea is such a sweetheart.  As I don't usually go to KFC, her customer service will bring me back to this location in the future. Andrea told me she was new to being a manager, and I think they made a good choice!  I went in during a busy time, but our order came out accurate and she made sure we had everything we need. I think her customer service will bring some reviews to this location around.  Keep up the good work, Andrea!"}
{"text":"If there were negative stars, I would use them! But they get one for the crew being nice! Took the family there to grab a meal. Inside was not busy, cleanliness was so, so. Couple in front of us were told 45 minutes for extra crispy chicken. We ordered 3 different meals. The bread on my Son's chicken little was hard. They did make him a new one. My chicken tenders were dry and old,  they did replace mine with an extra crispy thigh and drum that was fresh. They literally had no meat on them. My daughter in laws original chicken pieces were dry and lacked meat. Best part was the mashed potatoes. Not impressed with the food, and wish I would of spent my $20.00 elsewhere."}
{"text":"The cashier/order taker was missing in action. When he finally showed up he didn't even greet me, he didn't explain what's included with my $5 fill up box that I wanted to order. Forgot to give me a cup for my soda, didn't include any ketchup & sauce and the napkins were all wrinkled as they were just pulled out straight from a napkin dispenser... how
long does it take to at least properly fold 4 paper napkins? Just handed the bag to me not even taking time to go through to me with my order & ask if there's anything else I he can get me. Extremely POOR service...will NEVER go to there ever again!!!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?!  This was the worst KFC ever.  I was forced into eating here bc it's relatively close to CLT where I was picking someone up.  

I bought the $5 KFC meal, 3 boneless chicken meal.  First of all, you'd think how cool, it's a $5 meal, what a steal!  The chicken is much smaller, the side dish is like 8 macaroni and the biscuit was a pebble.

But the absolute worst part about it was the fact that the chicken was incredibly salty.  No, like really salty.   After the meal, the sides of my tongue still felt like they had a lot of salt on it.  It's like they dropped the chicken into a salt vat after dousing it in soysauce, and THEN marinated in the Dead Sea (for you worldly knowledgeable peepz!)

Service was incredibly slow. Sister was flying in from Cedar Rapids, I'm pretty sure I placed the order before she took off and she still arrived before my meal.  She had a layover in Chicago too because of Barry.

Terrible.

dmo out."}
{"text":"So glad they opened this KFC. The buffet is great and I'm thankful they finally have grilled chicken."}
{"text":"I have chicken once before and it was a awful place dirty, service below par, chicken dry, bathroom awful so do yourself a favor do not stop here its a bad experience.

If you want chicken walk across the lot to the other location it much better

BTW KFC DOES NOT Support any discounts for seniors, vets, and any other groups save your money and goes across the lot."}
{"text":"First they got my order wrong, they only heard half of it although they repeated it back to me as i ordered it...they didn't repeat the whole order at the end.... maybe they felt rushed as its dinner rush maybe.....

 While ordering i was told that they were out of pepsi... so i had to get mnt. dew...at the window i discovered they hadn't actually added my second 5$ meal...so i had to reorder that while i was there....as i looked at my receipt i saw that they had decided to give me ranch dip without ever asking me what i wanted...I asked if they could give me hot sauce as well and I was told they were also out of hot sauce...
. so i paid for the other half of my order and returned home.....

 To find that they had actually forgotten to give me sauce as well.......i was very frustrated by then , but just wanted to eat.    This isn't the first trouble at this restaurant..last time they also got my order wrong by forgetting my sides but he replaced the meal my following visit,

Tonight i called to tell the manager what all had gone wrong and the phone rang and rang..then disconnected the 3rd time someone finally answered...I wasn't even offered an apology.... certainly not any kind of compensation for my time and trouble. I wont be returning to say the least."}
{"text":"This is the worst location I have ever been to. I went through the drive thru around 9pm. NOBODY GREETED ME ON THE DRIVE THRU! I drove around and saw the employees run to the back as if they were hiding. I drove around AGAIN still nobody greeted me and NOBODY VISIBLY THERE AT THE WINDOW. So I drove to the front and noticed 2 employees INCLUDING The shift supervisor standing around and ANOTHER EMPLOYEE SITTING ON THE COUNTER WHERE THE FOOD IS PREPPED! Now how disgusting is that! Her butt on the same place where the food is made!! So I drive to the drive thru window knocked on the window nobody came , so I knocked in the front door window and the employees finally decided to get up. I drove around and after minutes of waiting around someone greeted me , so I drove to the window and the lead supervisor was at the window , I let him know how long I waited and that I saw them standing around and one sitting down on the counter. He NEVER APOLOGIZED, he just said he went to the back to change the battery on his headset. I didn't know it took that long to do so. And I know he was lying because I saw him standing around talking to the employees chit chatting away. I then asked what was the managers name then he said it doesn't matter anyway Because the manager is out of town and if I were to call and complain nothing would be done. I cannot believe how inconsiderate this \"Shift lead\" was his name is Luis. This place needs to be cleaned up with new management and employees. The number on google is incorrect or not working"}

I finally left when the car in front of me made it to the drive up window and sat for another 4 minutes before they took their money. Ridiculous they are that slow.  I ended up going to Arby's & got served right away. I'll never go back to this KFC!"}
{"text":"Normally I wouldnt waste my time reviewing a fast food restaurant but the service at this KFC is a joke.  I've gone twice the past few months and it has been horrible.  Today the person working the register was also having to expedite the orders which made things super slow.  What was crazy was that the guy behind me ordered a chicken pot pie and they said it would take 35 minutes...and he decided to wait for it.   This place needs to hire more staff and TRAIN them."}
{"text":"Typical KFC, this review is more of a slam on the corporate KFC for the ripoff they are doing by selling us Nashville wings.  Nashville Wings are really the same crispy chicken with hot sauce and a couple of pickle slices added for an extra $2.00 (for the 8 pack).  Pure ripoff."}

Just bad all around  and the kicker is that it wasn't even busy.."}

When I was able to order something they had, the lady put it down on the counter and walked to the backroom where every other employee was and started laughing. Stood at the counter for 3 minutes before I yelled for some service, twice, before someone heard me. Asked for honey, hot sauce and bbq sauce. It was handed to me and then I was told that I needed to watch my tone next time and that I am not allowed to holler for an employee. Stay away."}

{"text":"(REVIEW CENSORED AND OMITTED)

Oh how I wish that could've been true! This KFC has to be the worst one that I've ever been to in my life!

The service is extremely slow. The people who work there are of the younger generation who have no respect for adults not each other. How can anyone want to eat at a place where they call each other \"bitches\" and \"hoes?\" But I digress. They are very rude and put up an attitude if you correct their mistakes, which they make FREQUENTLY! I cannot tell you how many times I had to address a mistake that they made. And how dare they give me the stink eye for point that out. If you're that unhappy with the job, just leave.

Plus, they get an attitude if you decide to pay by card. By cash, they'll pocket the money. Trust me, I've seen it happen. They're too stupid to even try to conceal the fact that they're stealing.

The food quality has fallen off the rails over the years, not just this place in particular but the entire chain in general. The pieces are relatively smaller and they skimp on the side dishes, making you wonder where the hell nearly $2.00 went. The manager is also incompetent and completely oblivious of what these young punks are doing.

There's a reason why so many people are running away from this place. I overheard one patron saying while in line, \"Why didn't we go to Popeyes?\" And you know what? Why didn't the both of us? Case in point, you want good chicken, decent side dishes and wonderful customer service? Go to Popeyes and you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"First, do not believe the sign on the door about their operating hours.  It says the dinning room is open until 9:00pm.  I arrived at 8:20pm and found the front door locked.  This was a Monday night.  I should have known something was amiss because I saw 3 employees in the parking lot tossing a football around.  The next afternoon I returned around 4:00pm.  I order 5 pieces of original, a large slaw and a small box of wedges.  I requested 2 drumsticks, 2 thighs and a breast.  The drumsticks and thighs had more breading on them than chicken.  The breast coating was over cooked and the chicken was very dry.  The potato wedges tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp since lunch time.  The cole slaw turned out to be the best part of the meal.  They are so overpriced for what you get it is laughable.  KFC used to mean good quality chicken at a reasonable price.  Not anymore.  Too many good chicken places around to have to settle for this."}
{"text":"I'm just reviewing the newly added \"veggie sandwich\"

It is awesome. I have no idea what it is (my guess, some sort of soy patty) but it taste just like a chicken sandwich. It is generously coated with the signature KFC peppery coating and then smothered in mayo and lettuce. The patty itself has the same consistency of chicken. Could have been chicken for all I know!

Bottom Line: Definitely a goldmine for those who love fast food but gave it up when they switched to no meat. Also, KFC is one of the few fast food chains that still serves PEPSI and not coke."}
{"text":"I am shocked that a KFC located at Carowinds doorstep is this terrible.  If you put all 3 of my chicken strips together it would still be a lousy strip.  The biscuit was a hockey puck.  The cookie was raw.  The sweet tea and mashed potatoes were good.  There was, however, less than a tablespoon of gravy on either of our potatoes.  When I asked for more, I needed something to soften up that puck, they had the audacity to charge me 2.19...are you kidding me.  Apparently this franchise is banking on its name to make money.  I would be shocked that ANYONE would eat here twice."}
{"text":"Everytime we go to this KFC its always something. The chicken is never ready and itll be a 15-25 minute wait WTF! Youre a chicken place how do you not have chicken ready!!!??! This is the third time this has happen. Then a month ago I brought chicken for my dad a eight piece meal and when we got home it was a eaten chicken bone in the box. Sorry i never really write bad reviews but this is one of the worst KFC'S in town."}
{"text":"Decided to try KFC's new \"Nashville Hot\" chicken. Now I generally like KFC chicken but this new Nashville Hot, well that's just another swing-and-a-miss by KFC's senior management. A better idea would have been a Buffalo chicken strips with Ranch dressing."}
{"text":"no grilled chicken. Didn't want to eat greasy oily chicken guess it's El Pollo Loco right across the street"}
{"text":"Been here twice. It is near home and sometimes you want food quick and simple. First time they had just opened. Horrible flavorless too dried out chicken. Second time better flavor and fast service. Way too expensive. Too bad healthy is not on the menu."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good meal try something else. I am very disappointed with this restaurant and there delivery time!! It took them 1 1/2 hours to get it to me!!!!!"}
{"text":"So went here yesterday to order their new chicken sandwich the Zinger. So after waiting in the dining room for 10 mins the guy says hey you we don't have that sandwich right now. Um what after waiting 10 mins... Ok how long till it's made? 10 mins, I said ok I'll wait as he goes to tell them yes she will wait I see the person in the kitchen drop the tongs on the floor then pick them up and use them!! Oh hell nah give me my money back ya'll nasty!"}
{"text":"Now I love KFC in general, their original recipe & their crispy strips. Every time I go to this particular location close to my house, it's filthy, all the tables are dirty, the employees don't seem to care about anything. My biggest complaint is, now this is the second time this has happened to me at this location, I order a 12 piece crispy strip meal. I get home and there are 8 crispy strips and 4 boneless chicken with some breading that's spicy & my kids won't touch. Did they run out of crispy strips & just threw those in there knowing I wouldn't find out until I got home? If I wanted boneless chicken then  would have ordered it. From now on I will be going to the KFC on Silverado Ranch & Maryland Pkwy. The place is immaculate & the employees are efficient."}
{"text":"Management here sucks!!! Plain and simple!!! Arguing with the cashier and the customer over a coupon is dumb!!!! The GM and manager were there yelling that my coupon is only good for a certain thing, when it states clearly it's good for everything!!! What a bunch of morons!!!! And on top of the rudeness they forgot my biscuits, didn't want to waste my time going back!!! I will be calling corporate !!! Never coming back to this KFC ever again!!!"}
{"text":"The service was absolutely horrible. The guy sat there and stared at us for at least 5 minutes before coming up to the register to take our order, not even an apology for making us wait. After everyone ordered, I asked for ranch for 4 people and he only handed me 2. I asked for more and he said i had to pay for anymore. How are 4 people suppose to share 2 ranches? I can understand limiting 2 ranches per person, but only allowing us 2 ranches for the 4 of us was really frustrating. Not to mention I had to swipe my card a second one just to buy a few ranches. The only reason I am giving a 2 star is because the food still tasted okay. Was not happy with my visit,'I'm surprised they aren't out of business by now."}
{"text":"They only had dark meat and original recipe whoever orders messed up. But the customer service was fast and polite. I ordered a 3 piece meal with mashed potatoes and Cole slaw. Good food. Hot and fresh."}
{"text":"I often get the five dollar fill up. It's so cheap and I feel satisfied and full. I usually get the two piece dark meat original. It comes with mashed potatoes, a biscuit, and a chocolate chip cookie, AND and drink. The inside is the nicest kfc I've seen. Very clean and looks newly renovated. They are also very quick."}
{"text":"So I usually don't write reviews on fast food chains but this KFC has the worst customer service! My boyfriend and I were coming back from Barrett Jackson and I wanted churches but there wasn't any on the way home so we stopped by KFC.. so after ordering stuff it came out to $11 and some change and I gave the girl $12.. she looks at it counting it, then looks at me and was like \"ur short\" I was like no I'm not, count again.. she was like \"oh nevermind.\" Instead of giving my change back right away like most places do, she walks away and basically throws all my food in the plastic bag and hands it to me...I was like \"can I have my change?\" She was like \" I threw ur change in ur bag.. \" I looked and even my boyfriend looked and nothing.. she just had that irritated look like we did something wrong!! Never again will I come back.. when is it okay to just throw change in the customers bag...?? It's irritating that ppl like her are getting $10 an hour to just \"throw customers change in their bags\" or tell customers they didn't pay the right amount because they CAN'T COUNT!!"}
{"text":"Just got food here and they didn't give us biscuits with our meal!!! Gave us honey though!!!! They didn't ask us if we wanted original or extra crispy!! No napkins!! COME ON MAN!!!"}
{"text":"Not that I expect something outstanding from KFC but this location is not one to try again.  A little dirty, slow and food is just off - how does skin for extra crispy come almost soggy?"}
{"text":"When I get food here, well anywhere. I always special order things. Due to food allergies and things like that. They always get it right and have never shorted me on food. Which is a bonus. The chicken is surprising better then other KFC. If you get a famous bowl you get actual chicken strips inside of those ugly chicken balls. I would give it 5 stars but the staff isn't very social."}
{"text":"In reference to the gentleman's review on this being the zoo, he is completely accurate . However , the zoo is more tamed and worth the visit than this run down KFC . Inappropriate behavior from the staff in front of customers , horrible manager , rude in-store cashiers , cold food , incorrect orders . 

Don't waste your time ."}
{"text":"Thank you KFC, for reminding me why I hadn't visited you in many many years. Bad service, dirty place, terrible chicken and the list goes on and on. This is what happens when you ask your 8 year old what she would like for dinner."}
{"text":"Worst KFC EVER!!! The question isn't what's wrong, it's, what's right with this chicken coop. They never have extra crispy, they move slower than snails, close early, mess up your order (ALWAYS!) They charge too much for chicken that tastes like Bat Wing, not that I've tasted Bat Wing, but it must taste close to this, customer service what's customer service and the restaurant is always a greasy, filthy pit of chicken innards!!! Forget this place like grandma forgets your name. How about a corporate   
Shutdown for running a Kentucky Fried Botulism?"}
{"text":"This place is a complete disaster service-wise (can't tell you about the food since I never got to try it). I waited 20 minutes to have my order taken and I was first in line! There had been many people ahead of me, but they took off after waiting for over 15 minutes to order. Once I made the order I was told to pay at the other end. So I go to pay and there was no one at the cash! So I waited another 10 minutes and then left. While waiting I was chatting with the herd of people waiting for their order and they told me that they had been waiting for their order for over 30 minutes. 

Train your people!"}
{"text":"Omg this place is horrrrrible! Their card machine is ALWAYS down where they'll take cash only orders. The customer service is terrible, the workers are rude and short with you. They are always out of something. I just got home and found out they forgot the gravy for our mashed potatoes. Really? I mean really KFC in surprise? You SUCK!"}
{"text":"Wow! If you want really good fried chicken at a fast food restaurant, this is the place. I ordered a two breast dinner box. I wanted to try original and extra crispy. They said I could have both. Both were delicious. The meat was cooked beautifully. Hot, moist and nice fresh pieces. Unlike the Bojangles also near me. Great sides too. I had mash potatoes and coleslaw. Nice soft fresh biscuit too. Next time I am in the mood for fried chicken, this will be the place! No Bojangles for me!"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars, I would. I have been a long time fan of KFC chicken.  Tonight I showed up around 7, knowing from experience that I would have to wait awhile for my 16 piece bucket of all dark Original. I ordered at the drive through window, and was told it would be a 20 minute wait for enough dark to fill the order. The girl that took my order asked me if I \"just didn't want to have to pay the extra for the white chicken\" lol!  Seriously? Anyway, I pulled around front and waited 30 minutes and still no chicken. I went in and waited several minutes for someone to acknowledge my presence. The girl that originally took my order would not make eye contact with me. The manager comes up and tells me that there had been a problem with the fryer, and it was going to be another 10 minutes, did I want a refund or to wait the 10 minutes. I told her that if it was just going to be 10 minutes, I would wait - if the fryer was working and it would be ready. So after waiting 45 minutes for my chicken, it was finally ready. The guy that brought it to my car was nice and apologetic, and said they gave me a cake for the wait. When I got home, I found that the order was half white and half dark. Much worse than that was the fact that the dark chicken was raw!! Bloody and pink. The final straw, however, was when I called the manager, only to be treated rudely.  She wanted to argue with everything I complained about - that I couldn't have ordered all dark, that it cooked for the correct amount of minutes, yada-yada. Needless to say, I won't be back. Raw chicken pictures will be attached if I can figure out how to do that."}
{"text":"Incredibly rude staff, messed up my order the first time, and when the girl handed me my fill up box, she didn't even include the cookie and even forgot to give me a fork. She lacked satisfactory customer service and
this honestly isn't the first time I've received shitty service from this KFC.

Close this damn place down or stop hiring idiots smh"}
{"text":"This is the worst KFC ever!  I've lived near this location for 25 years and I would guess I've been there a dozen times.  Every time has been disappointing.  No chicken of the type I want available; missing items from my order; inept employees; drive thru takes forever; etc.  I understand that these things can happen anywhere but something ALWAYS happens at this restaurant.  I've been to other KFC's while traveling and they are fine. I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"If a half star was available it'd be more appropriate... They've never got an order right in the 3x's I've been there. They're offended when you ask for corn instead of coleslaw but are unapologetic when they forget half your order. Colonel Sanders would cry like a baby if he saw the current KFC."}
{"text":"Service was a bit on the slow side. One girl Ashley trying to run everything. She was working harder than she should have been. She needed help on the front end. 
Restaurant was clean. Food was excellent. Only local KFC I will go to. See you next time!"}
{"text":"The only thing I can say nice is the cashier was awesome. Food was absolutely horrible!
Chicken tasted like fish n the fish tasted like chicken. Tasted like it had been sitting under a warmer all day. Coke area was unkept. For as many employees as they had working it took really long time to get our food. 15 mins. There was only one person in front of us. Didn't understand the long wait. Food was already in warmers and made. Glad I checked order before I left. We had two orders of mashed potatoes instead of fries. This extended our wait 5 more mins. Will not return."}
{"text":"Some KFCs have greasy tables and chairs from greasy chicken. Not this location.Very clean restaurant. Area around drink machine is clean and well organised. Friendly staff. My receipt says Carline is my cashier. He greeted me with a smile and how are you. As always chicken is great! This southern girl thinks their sweet tea rocks! Recommend this location and will be back. :)"}
{"text":"Never go wrong with KFC especially if you don't want to cook and tonight is a great night for it with NBA finals on..food is always on point especially the mash potatoes and the hot wings"}
{"text":"Customer service is bad, they need a customer service trainings, they have an attitude taking orders especially the girl name Mornie, i feel bad for her it seems she's not happy working at KFC. A lot of people out there wants a job. Im not coming back at this location anymore!!! Sucks workers!!!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a MINUS STARS but that's not an option. I am sitting in the parking lot LIVID at the treatment I got. 

NEVER ask for something to be made the way you want it. I asked for a potato bowl with bbq chicken instead of popcorn - sorry I can't do that.

OK give me a potato bowl with potatoes, extra corn, NO gravy and no chicken

I'll take a side order of bbq chicken - sorry ma'am I can't do that. 

Then give me a fucking bbq chicken sandwich and I'll throw the bread away.  Never mind, I will find somewhere else to buy my dinner. By the way, what's your store number?  He wouldn't tell me. 

I had the same problem at 2 stores in California and according to their corporate offices, they ARE allowed to make what the customer wants as long as they have the ingredients."}
{"text":"After having my blood pressure soar through the roof at the 67th & Peoria Store, I drove to this store. 

Yaaaaaay Chris!!  You got it!!!  Although what I asked for is different, they did exactly as I asked instead of being jackasses like the jerk at the other store. 

BBQ Chicken bowls should be a menu item in every store. Not everyone likes gravy on their bowls. 

Thanks again, Chris!  I will be back!!"}
{"text":"This KFC was the worst in insulting you with the \"food\" they serve. They will sell you chicken that is old ... so old that the juice settles back into the breading on their \"extra crispy\" that it actually turns grey and soggy. This has made me decide to spend my money $22.00 to be exact elsewhere. .....Mr. Sanders would be ashamed. ..."}
{"text":"The customer service at this KFC is far beyond any other in the area. The employees are always extremely polite, friendly, and willing to help with anything needed. Will drive 20 minutes out of the area to come to the KFC just because it is always a positive experience."}
{"text":"If I could give this location 0 stars, I would. We went through the drive thru on Memorial day. The cashier taking out order was rude, and at the counter seemed distracted. They didn't have our order ready and asked us to pull around the front to wait. After seeing a bag sitting on the counter for about 5 minutes we went in to enquire about our order. They brought it over to us and walked away. The chicken strips were small, dry and not even warm. They put 2 cookies instead of bisquits. They also didn't include napkins spoons/forks for the mashed potatoes, or any condiments. We had to go back in and get things, the guy was rude and questioned why we need BBQ sauce for the chicken tenders. The butter they gave us was melted (says keep refrigerated on package). The soda was watered down. Never going back there."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Kept me waiting in the drive thru for 10 minutes when there were no customers, then no napkins in the bag, and an extra charge just to use a debit card. Worst KFC I've ever been to in my life.


AVOID."}
{"text":"This restaurant doesn't even rate the one star I had to give it to post! The manager at this restaurant treated me with total disrespect after they failed to give me corn, mashed potatoes and coleslaw. He was so rude and mean and didn't care I was exhausted, just off dialysis and on oxygen while arguing that I was not telling the truth and refusing to compensate me in any way. After I asked him to call his manager he refused to let me talk to him and told me he would give me the missing sides. Then I heard everyone in the kitchen laughing so I suspect they spit into the food. Or contaminated it in some way. DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION unless you want to be treated like crap for their mistake!!"}
{"text":"Ok so we had the munchies after the movies... why not KFC. Normally they aren't disappointing. We had the wings and we also ordered some potato wedges.

Wings are normal; but the potato wedges were AWFUL. What a waste of money. They should know better than to serve this to their customers. I mean; would you want to eat something so disappointing. These wedges were fried so hard it was ridiculous and not edible....!!! Smh!"}
{"text":"We waited thirty minutes for four meals and they never came. When asked for our money back the manager pretended she didn't see us and continued filling orders for the drive thru. We never got our money and we'll be filing a dispute with our card company. Avoid this dump."}
{"text":"ROTEN SERVICE

Terrible service and gets orders wrong they don't give plates or forks/ napkins and they overcharged us for something we did not order"}
{"text":"I came here and there was nobody there but myself. The cashier Bret was very unfriendly. He did not ask if it was for here or to go. It was packed to go and I was eating there. Had to ask for receipt cause he did not give me one. How can I eat corn and mashed potatoes without a fork. Had to ask for one. Now I see why they have a very low rating. The food was ok."}
{"text":"This is the WORST kfc. Every time I go there is some issue. Last time no Barbque Sauce and today no salt. I was told they would check and nobody came back to let me know. I would have eaten somewhere else except they already swiped my debit card. Since there are not many kfc's left unfortunately this is the nearest. They need to get there SHI___ together. I was not given a receipt to do their survey. I am not going back in the near future..."}
{"text":"I drive past here and live close by.  It is the only KFC on my way home from work.  Every time I have been here, about 5 or 6 times within the last couple years the service and food has been horrible.  Every time, the wait is long and the food is constantly cold.  I'd rather drive all the way to 19th ave and Union hills for KFC than this one so I get warm and fast service. 

The manager needs to make some changes......"}
{"text":"Food is always good at the KFC on Aliante Pkwy and 215 :)"}
{"text":"Never too crowded. Not sure if that us good or bad. This is the second time I have been to this location. The people are always friendly and professional every time I come. 
We love the slaw from KFC which is why we went today."}
{"text":"The chicken here is better then most KFCs. The service is ok. The people are nice and they mean well but sometimes it's just doesn't work out. They often run out of chicken so the choices are limited sometimes."}
{"text":"I am still on a fried chicken kick. I go through food phases. I'm still in this one. 

After visiting Shoppers Drug Mart, I ended up driving north on Kipling Avenue. The KFC that I normally go to is on Highway 27. I didn't feel like driving in the opposite direction from where I needed to go. 

While stopped, I did a quick search and found this KFC, which was two blocks away. Nice! 

I needed a left turn. I turned into the Pizza Pizza lot, which doesn't allow you to drive over to the KFC lot. I parked and walked over. 

This KFC has a drive-thru. I imagine that most folks either do takeout or hit the drive-thru. This location had a handful of tables and seats if you want to dine in. This location is small. 

I ordered the three-piece chicken box meal. It comes with a side, fries, and a fountain drink. I heard the woman say two sides at first. I needed her to clarify. Yes, you only get one side. I went with macaroni salad. 

The chicken pieces are small at this location. Blink and you may miss seeing them. I ended up with four small pieces. They tasted yummy. 

I was happy with my macaroni salad. It was creamy, as expected. The fries are what you'd expect from KFC. I keep forgetting to get gravy. They'd taste better with some. 

This location is fine, but I like my usual one on Albion Road, just east of Highway 27, more.

(158)"}
{"text":"There is a Petro-Canada that I frequent often. It is on my way home on the southeast corner of Highway 27 and Albion Road.

I noticed one day that there is a KFC-Taco Bell combo store around the corner from this gas station. Normally, I crave Taco Bell. These days, I am on a fried chicken kick, so I gave KFC a try.

In Markham, there used to be two KFC locations close to where I live, along Steeles Avenue East. They have since shut down. My closest KFC is either by Markville Shopping Centre or in northern Scarborough.

I gave the KFC drive-thru a try. It was my first time ever using the drive-thru to order KFC. My past experience has always been to walk into the store.

I wanted a light meal. I went with a two-piece chicken meal. It came with fries, a drink, and a cookie. My meal was $6.25, which included tax.

I had a difficult time hearing what the woman was saying over the speaker. Ah, yes, the usual with such systems! She asked me whether I wanted white meat. Normally, i would say yes. However, I lived a little and said no. Eventually, we both communicated what we wanted and I drove up to the window to pay. I used my debit card.

The chicken was tasty. It was seasoned nicely. It wasn't greasy. I loved it.

The fries are your standard KFC ones. Next time, I will need to ask for gravy. I always like the gravy at KFC, which complements the fries nicely.

I was too full to eat my chocolate chunk cookie. I was surprised that I got one. It looked like a Mrs. Fields one, as I have had plenty of experience eating them and can identify them anywhere! Yep, it was. If you have a chance to warm it up in the microwave for several seconds, it's pretty good, especially when the chocolate chunks get all gooey.

Service was pleasant. Staff are competent. My order was accurately fulfilled.

I will come back here to give the other items a shot. I have never had the popcorn chicken, so that's my next meal. I will also give dining in the restaurant a go. There were only two customers there when I pulled out of the drive-thru at around 6 pm.

{"text":"This review is my 150th of 2017. Considering that I went away to Shanghai for two weeks and I couldn't use Yelp, the number of reviews that I have done so far this year impresses me!

I did a staycation earlier in July. I felt like fetching a quick bite to eat for dinner and went through? this drive-thru. It's a combined KFC and Taco Bell. 

I ordered the soft chicken combo (two tacos)  I upgraded to nachos supreme and asked to hold the sour cream on my entire order. It was strange, but I got to the payment window and my order changed to a chillupa. What?

After getting my order fixed, including making sure that nothing had sour cream in it, all was well. I got a Diet Pepsi to wash everything down. 

I ate in my hotel room, watching TV for hours, which I normally don't do. However, it felt like a vacation to  me! I was happy with my nachos supreme. It was yummy. My chicken soft tacos hit the spot. 

Service was pretty prompt. The accuracy needs some improvement, but I'd go back here.

{"text":"This place is a typical KFC-Taco Bell combination. I crave Taco Bell now and again. I come here to get a quick bite. I like that I can place my order through the drive-thru. The other day, I decided to walk in. 

I'm not a huge KFC fan. KFC did have a lot of decent specials, but I didn't feel like having everything fried to death. 

I ordered my usual when I do visit Taco bell, which consists of two soft taco supremes and an upgrade to nachos supreme. Since I am borderline lactose-intolerant, I always ask that the sour cream be omitted. This place has always been good about holding it. 

The woman at the counter was friendly. I ate there, which was a first. The interior is decent. It's clean and comfortable. 

The woman who had placed my order came over to ask how my dinner was. It was good for Taco Bell. She helped put away my tray, which was a nice touch. 

I'd rate this place 3.5 stars. If you feel like cheap fast food with excellent customer service, this place would be a decent choice."}
{"text":"Would give 0 stars if I could. I have gone to this location multiple times. Drive through takes forever, so I went inside, which also took forever. The whole place is always dirty, even the employees. When I finally get my food, the chicken strips are dry and old. This happens every time. Going to Chic-fil-a instead."}
{"text":"I haven't ordered the hot wings before, so I decided to give them a try. I now have figured out why there seems to be a lot less pigeons and doves around.   The wings are so small that they don't appear to be chicken. Also, I don't know why they are called hot wings, because they taste like regular chicken with not even a hint of hot spice. 
Hey KFC - are you proud of the product that you serve to your customers?  For the price that you charge, I expect the best. And quit killing the pigeons!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible!!! I order 2 buckets of chicken worth 37dollars, and ask for plate. Employee said she can only give 4 plates.  But i ordered 2 buckets of chicken. So i told  them my other kids will be eating in the park without plate? I said other KFC they give you how much you want. So horrible!! After i said that i don't have plan to sell the plate..manager said you can have plate..while looking at the other staff. Manager is so stingy!! This kind of manager will give bad reputation to KFC. Calling the attention of the corporate!!!please monitor this place!! I am not coming back to this place."}

{"text":"This place is absolutely horrible they have horrible customer service and they are super slow I have came to this location several times and that is the same thing every single time I waited almost 30 minutes for my food and I waited almost 30 minutes just for them to take my order so I just left and went somewhere else they fail for service completely go somewhere else"}
{"text":"This review is based on the service and quality of food from April 2, 2018 around 4:30 pm. As you can see from the picture I took; the meal was exceptional  everything was hot, fresh and very flavorful! The chicken was moist and the skin was the perfect kind of crunchy! Nothing got soggy. This meal went straight from containers to my plate at home. My family and I were very pleased with our meal tonight. The staff working did an excellent job cooking the food and handling the food. Thank you for the great service! Something like this shouldn't go unnoticed. I would love to come back on a day when the same staff is working! BTW - we purchased the $20 fill up box , well worth it!"}
{"text":"The food here is disgusting!
I didn't buy anything but my friend bought some grilled chicken with green beans and coleslaw. He found the hairs IN the chicken YUCK! His green beans were very sour and tasted disgusting. The coleslaw was sticky and smelled like feet.
DON'T GO HERE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Who goes to a chicken restaurant, and there is NO chicken?  The worst service ever! I pulled up to the drive thru and waited almost 10 minutes before I got to the window. When I finally pulled up to order, the staff member said, \"one moment please\". Well, after I sat there for another 10 minutes, she came on the intercom and asked me for my order.  I ordered a 10 piece meal.  At this time she interrupted me and told me there would be a 30 minute wait for chicken! Who does this? She knew she didn't have chicken when she asked me to wait. I wasted over 20 minutes in this ridiculous drive thru. NEVER NEVER NEVER go there!"}
{"text":"Ridiculous! ! I called their complaint line and still a run around!  I can't stand to be called a liar
 I spoke to someone who said he was part of corporate and they act like I didn't.  I wrote all of his information down. Chicken tenders were like rocks!! I won't come to this KFC ever again."}
{"text":"No wonder KFC is dying a slow death. 

They were setting up to close an hour before posted times, so we used the drive thru.

They were 'out of chicken'. Um... What? 

$23 after tax for an 8 piece meal without drinks. Insane.

All the chicken they scraped up was 10% meat, 90% over-salted breading. 

The girl did an awful job packing... We got home and found she hadn't put the gravy lid on properly. It was all over everything and half of it was wasted. 
That was the point we became legitimately pissed and decided no more KFC. Out of your staple item + as expensive as a sit-down joint + lazy employees who can't even put a lid on = see ya!"}
{"text":"The food is not bad but the service leaves a lot to be desired. The cleanliness is non existent. Tables are sticky, food stuck to the floor and it looks like dining area hasn't been cleaned in a long while,even though the place is not busy."}
{"text":"The food was good but we had a problem . I asked her for the $5.25 box , my husband also , but when we paid it was over $16 , and I thought that was wrong , I kept telling her the $5 box , but I didn't get a cookie either , or a receipt , I knew something was not right because I told her 3 times we wanted the $5 special , and I looked for my receipt , did't have that or the cookies and paid $16? I am not happy at all!!! We was having fun until I realized I was cheated . I even took a pic with the COL. Sanders statue . But this makes me upset money for me is hard to come by and my husband and I was cheated . Got no receipt or the right meals we ordered . Won't go back"}
{"text":"Every time we go to this KFC and my husband orders hot wings we end up having to wait 10-15 minutes after we order , and the chicken strip box I got yesterday was not worth $5.25 , I got 3 strips of fried chicken skin, it was hard , and very little to no meat. Will never go there again!!"}
{"text":"That's right KFC, one star!
Teach your employees how to do a double order through the drive through, this is so rediculous! OMG! It's 2017!!!!
Lost me as a customer!"}
{"text":"So I would love to tell you how good the food is but apparently they don't accept double orders through the drive through. We asked how we get 2 seperate orders, she replied get your 1st order and then drive around and get back in line to get the second order. We responded, but there's no one behind us, that's so silly. We decided against do circles around Kfc and went to El Polo Loco where the food was Awesome!"}
{"text":"If I could not rate this place at all, I wouldn't !!
I'm sure when I say this I speak for ALOT OF PEOPLE. THEY ARE ALWAYS OUT OF SOMETHING  . The few times my boyfriend and I have been to this location we have always had to wait for food. for Example like today, we were told that we'd have to wait (30MIN) for a 12 piece chicken trip box. And then drove to another location. 

Few months ago we went got our food everything was ok. Long story short. From the time I got up too order from the time I had to sit and wait for them to bring out my order. The cashier at the window was talking real slow and her words were a slur. If you ask me I'd say she was on something  don't get me wrong she wasn't rude but just odly weird. 

(ANOTHER) time we went. THEY WERE COMPLETELY OUT OF THIER HOUSE HOT SAUCE.  Now tell me, how can you be out of KFC condiment sauce. So we were sent home to vend for our own hot sauce. 

So you ask \"Why do you continue to go there?\" Well reason is that We never think going to KFC that all this will KEEP happening time after time. Now sometimes WHEN WE DO GO THERE my boyfriend and I bet on weather they will be out of food or not. We usually both bet that they won't  that is all ! GOOD DAY"}
{"text":"If you want your order to be correct go some place else.... Not only did they  NOT process the correct order when placed, because the person was too busy to listen, yet it was repeated back. When you do finally get the food after waiting, you have to go back in because they didn't even give you ALL of your order. All point of drive-thru is not get out of your car.."}
{"text":"typical KFC, you've been to one, you've been to them all. Usually not much of a lineup if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst KFC I've ever been to. Love KFC and will always eat there but never again at this location. I ordered the 3 piece tender Nashville Hot Chicken expecting it to look similar to the advertising picture. Ha! Not only were the tenders flat but they weren't even covered in the Nashville Hot Sauce. They looked like someone had a squeeze bottle and made one pass over them. Not completely coated like the picture. Also had to wait 20 minutes for this nonsense. Paid $6.92 for this crap. I will think twice about going to lunch at KFC. From now on its only a bucket of chicken for me and the family. Save your money and your tastebuds. False advertising from Monroe KFC."}
{"text":"I'm giving one star. ..not because of service or food, but because you charge a fee of 39 cents to use a debit card. That's like charging a fee for the plates or cups. Sorry, KFC. That's a cost of doing business.  I'll be disputing the charge with my credit card company because the receipt I was given doesn't match what I paid. You should be ashamed."}
{"text":"I was super excited when they opened because the closest KFC by Mountain's Edge is the one in Durango. 

I gave them 2 stars because first impression was not that good. The cashier was very nice however, when I got my order (4 go cups) there was barely anything in there! Good thing I checked before leaving. There was literally 5 small wedges in each cup! When I requested the cashier to put more, she called the manager. The manager told me that this is how they normally fill their cups and that it has to be at a certain line. He was nice enough to put more (he added a couple of chicken n wedges in each lol wth). I said whenever we go to other KFC locations they all fill their cups. 

My advice: always check your order before leaving. 
Hopefully they'll get better in time though. I'll post an update review."}
{"text":"The Georgia Gold Honey Mustard BBQ doesn't taste like honey, mustard or barbecue...  just random spiciness.  The place is clean, and the employees are really friendly."}
{"text":"FAST FAST FAST. 

I mean before we could even get our drinks from the machine they were handing us our food. I was like, wow! They were polite and got the order correct. They were pretty busy also, people in and out quickly. 

The table was clean, but the chair wasn't. Had some food stuck on it, but it was all dried up, so I got nothing on me lol."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait until our KFC opened on State Rd and I have not been disappointed...the chicken is so flavorful and the coleslaw is very tasty.  I see where people have gotten a wrong order...this happened to me once so I drove myself back around to the order station from outside and stated my problem..they not only fixed it but gave me my dinner at no charge.  The staff is always very friendly too...my 95 year old mom thinks it is finger licking good!"}
{"text":"Uhhhhh, Ok I guess this place was good, my only complaint about it was the mac n' cheese that I got wasn't stirred up, it looked like when you make kraft mac n' cheese and just pour the cheese powder on there and not mix it together....yeah kinda gross. Everything was great about this place otherwise, fast and friendly service and was in and out within 6 mins."}
{"text":"So tired of these types of places. Poor food, poor attitudes and dirty dining rooms.  If you don't like your job find another it's not my fault you work at KFC. Douchebag. Oh yeah and it smells funny in there.  0 stars."}
{"text":"Don't come here. Didn't get the order right and there was a BUG in the bag that fell on our table. YES A BUG. still alive and everything. And no it didn't come from our apartment... It came from inside the bag. I'm saving y'all a trip."}
{"text":"Not a lot to say. Food is poorly prepared, the last time we ordered hot wings we got TWO of the little end wing pieces included as wings. Just a soggy, greasy, crazy expensive hot mess. Find another outlet if you really want KFC."}
{"text":"They can't be serious, another screw up order tonight.  I ordered 20 pieces hot wings and went to my and counted it and I only have 15 pieces.  So I went back in and they try to offer couple small pieces of original chicken wings with only cost 3 bucks and 5 pieces of hot wings cost around $5.24.  So it's a big difference, I told the manager to add another pieces of chicken in there to make it up but she won't vouch.  So I end returning everything and get my money back.  This is the last time I'm coming into this place.  They screw up many times to my orders and I've been cutting them a break.  But a 5 hotwings missing is way too much. No wonder no eats inside the restaurant when I arrived.  I also noticed that they focused on the drive thru too much and they forgot to serve the main counter.  We always have to wait before someone can take our orders.  Which is every time.  I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"Incompetent staff at this KFC location seem incapable of doing takeout orders right. On my previous visit I asked for a 15 piece bucket, dark meat only, yet half the bucket was wings and breasts!  I had to complain to get the order corrected.  I ordered the same thing today plus a medium gravy. Before I left,  I asked if the gravy was included and the young woman at the counter assured me it was.  Stupid me,  I should have checked. Got home,  no gravy in the bag. I am fed up with the staff at this KFC and I  won't be back."}
{"text":"Expected delivery time tonight 8:37 pm. Actual delivery time 9:48 pm. It isn't like pizza, 30 minutes and it's free. Nope. We had to phone TWICE to ask what had happened to our order tonight. We were STARVING. And we live only a block and a half away from the KFC location at 2000 Jane Street. There is simply no excuse for this.  So what did KFC offer us? They comped us the $5.00 delivery charge. BIG DEAL. The delivery person got annoyed at US that he was losing the $5.00. Now you have HAD it 2000 Jane Street KFC.  It will be a cold day in Hell before we order from you again."}
{"text":"The only thing on a KFC menu worth having is their still miraculously superior cole slaw. Everything else is blander than the Hallmark Channel and greasier than a metrosexual's hair. 

The wait for your order will also be excruciatingly long.

No, I did not want to come here, but forces beyond my control dictated my visit last week. Blame the Cosmic Trickster. 

Go to to Frisch's in Caste Village for better food and service. The Colonel must be stopped!!!

Why do they not call it Kentucky Fried Chicken anymore? Maybe it's not really chicken that they're selling!

Note: This location also offers Taco Bell selections, but I've never tried any of that hogswallow."}
{"text":"Horrible. Ordered the chicken pot pie. ut was Obviously old as once I broke thru the crust everything was Congealed. Never got the extra biscuits I paid for. Haven't been here in over 6 months and now remember why. Never again."}
{"text":"Can't see myself ever coming back. Went through the drive through and had to wait about 3-4 minutes before someone even took my order. Then waited another 5 minutes before I got to the window (there was only 1 car in front of me). Once I got to the window they repeated an order that wasn't mine, so I had to repeat it. They took my money and then I sat for over 10 minutes! The manager passed by the window a number of times and never made eye contact. They opened the window only to tell me that it would be another 4 minutes and I should pull around to wait. I could've made my own chicken dinner at that point."}
{"text":"Working at a fast food place is not a dream job, but it's not that complicated either. You are there to do your job correctly and get paid, the end. This is something that the employees there need to take note of. My boyfriend and I were super hungry our way home from the Fashion Show and Chinatown. Alas, there's a KFC! We ordered, got our food and left, only to find that his meal's side dishes were missing back at home. He was really ticked since the side dishes were what he was most looking forward to, and the KFC was really far and out of the way to have to drive back to get the order corrected.

My meal was fine, but I wouldn't risk going back there. The employee handling our food was too busy talking to an off duty employee to make sure she had everything right. It was a very typical food order for them and they managed to mess that up? Not coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I wish I could give the place zero stars!!!! Every time I come to this location they are extremely rude and incompetent. If you can't work at a KFC then what is your life? You guys fucking suck!"}
{"text":"Now if there was ever a review that I am qualified to conduct it would be one of KFC. I feel justified in making this claim because I) I am one fried chicken eating motha*#@^%$# 2) I first had KFC in the late 60's so I've been grubbing on it for nearly half a century 3) like any true coneissure I know burnt from over-cooked, well-done,under-cooked, etc. Ive also been educated in the natural sciences and  being an animal lover inclusive I would like to go out onto a limb and say \" the last time I checked chickens did not have ears\" Naaaawww just kidding folks seein iffin your awake. Seriously though I never really bragged on this little tidbit of anatomical know how but I can name all the parts of a chicken.....lets make that all the parts humans normally consume.Thigh, leg, breast, wing right right ok then what part of the chicken did I find in my bucket last night. It was round really spherical about 1.75 inches in diameter....ok guys get your senses of humor outta the gutter any chicken with jewels like that I DONT WANNA MESS WITH. Anyway I never did find out, was to embarrassed to ask, so I passed them to the back up review board, no not my lady.... my dog and so far she hasn't complained yet. I know this particular branch is seriously under managed cause I frequent it often and for the last 13 years, bless their hearts I gave em 2 stars because they always let you take the chicken back if you don't like it and that's at least as far as I am concerned worth something......like another free meal the next day !"}
{"text":"I hated to have to give one star!!! This is a place to STAY AWAY FROM! We decided to go to KFC because of an ad we saw on TV. When we started to order the very rude guy behind the speaker said they don't honor those prices because this is a franchise store, not a corporate store. Then when he asked what we wanted to drink we said pink lemonade for the kids, he replied, we only have regular lemonade and it is thirty cents more (what?) We went through the drive-through because at 8:30 pm the dining room is already closed??? We pulled around to the window and a very unpleasant girl took our payment. She then proceeded to hand us drinks and bags with our food.  We got our card and asked for a receipt, hoping there would be a \"How did we do\" website or number on it, there wasn't and after seeing the bad reviews here I can see why. When we got home the nightmare continued. One of the dinners looked like they intentionally shook it and everything was covered with gravy. Nothing like a good chocolate chip cookie with gravy. I can't believe that KFC would allow someone so incompetent to own and run a store and give the entire company a black eye. What a shame."}
{"text":"Wish I could give no stars, walked in trash is completely overflowing all onto the floor then told at 6:45 pm that there is over a 15 minute wait for any type of chicken! All you do is make chicken how are we messing this up? When I asked the cashier told me the wait was due to a new cook, his first night there and probably his last! Wth why would you tell your customers this?? Just bad all the way around!!"}
{"text":"They never have all their items on their menu, they are posted to close at 9 on Friday's and close earlier than posted times.   Not convenient for a fast food restaurant to run out of chicken and close early on weekends.  Better off going a few blocks down to Canes or Popeyes!!"}
{"text":"I guess I should have read the reviews before I took the family for a quick dinner meal here. 

Ordered an original chicken piece kids meal and a chicken strip kids meal for my two girls. Specifically asked if the meals had to come with the apple sauce pouch since we don't allow our children to eat from pouches after the whole larva incident. He stated no. You can get an additional side. Great. We ordered two additional sides. We then ordered myself and my husband a meal. 

Upon receipt of our order we received two chicken strip meals WITH apple sauce. Great. We didn't receive the original chicken piece meal and we got apple sauce instead of another side for which they then said you get a cookie, a HARD STALE COOKIE at that instead of the apple sauce. Fine. We took the cookie to throw away later. Aside from my girls food, mine and my husband's food wasn't too bad I guess. 

Only foul part was later I go back up to the counter, wait 3-4 minutes while the front counter cashier AND the drive thru cashier eat their meals on the line. Yes, the same line they serve our food out of. One of the guys stuffs his last bite into his mouth and walks to the counter and I ask him for ranch sauce. I guess there wasn't any under the front counter because he then walks toward the back counter to look and the original counter cashier says in Spanish, \"Dayum, is the B*tch gonna ask for anything else?!\" I guess Spanish speaking Belizean trumps him because I understood every word he said. Needless to say we won't be going back."}
{"text":"I'd eat vegetarian at KFC cuz there chickens disgusting literally got wings and every single one was bloody. All there sides good tho"}
{"text":"If i could give zero i would, went there yesterday to buy a 8 piece meal chicken for take home, me and family excited to eat because it smells so great, but when we are ready to eat , the chicken was not appealing it looks so dry and when we try to take a bite it was hard the taste is different than before, very disappointed , i will never go this place again , unless if they make it better.. i told to my family stop going to kfc for now because wasn't that tasty anymore their food  which they agree with it.."}
{"text":"Went to the drive thru ordered a bunch of chicken and a bunch of chicken strips etc. Go up and pay then afterwards she tells me oh we need to cook chicken strips it's going to be 7 minutes. I think she should have mentioned that before she ran my card, but either way I pull over and wait. 10 minutes later I go inside and ask for a refund. Then after he refund the money on my card he tells me the chickens ready do I wanna buy it. I have a teething baby screaming in the car and was so frustrated that I just said no thank you and left. I don't mind you running out of chicken strips but be honest about the time frame and at least give me the opportunity when I'm ordering it to opt out."}
{"text":"I went thru drive thru on 8-18-17 4;13pm. Eyanna was the cashier, she seem to be rushing you when ordering and not being very friendly needs some retraining in the customer service department!!! My chicken was horrible to much fat and not fresh!! The only good thing was my cold Pepsi!!"}
{"text":"I don't normally make reviews for fast food chains such as KFC unless it's exceptionally good or bad. And this one is the latter. The family bucket meal I bought here besides the sides seemed like it was at least 8 hours old. It was stale and the breading on the original recipe wasn't good at all.

This is probably the worst KFC I've been too. Just avoid this place, and KFC doesn't seem to do quality control at this location."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!! I have been in the drive thru for the past 25 minutes and I still haven't ordered! This is ridiculous, I came to a drive-thru for fast food not for a 5 course meal. Worst experience by far."}
{"text":"No receipt, received an individual Cole slaw when I ordered a large, and top top it off it was frozen!  YES, FROZEN!  So gross!  Tried to call to complain, it doesn't even ring, just dead air.  Never going back."}
{"text":"Ordered a half gallon of lemonade. Got it home nothing but colored water.  Try to call numbers been disconnect.  Found a second number nothing but busy for over 2 hours.  This is not the customer service it was 30 years ago when I worked there."}
{"text":"In the words of the late great Colonel Sanders - \"I'm to drunk... to taste this chicken.\"

I don't like fried chicken to begin with, but sometimes I'm in a hurry and KFC buffalo sliders just sound delicious. To tell you the truth, they are delicious, and that is the only reason this shit hole is getting two stars. I've often gone here and the place is closed when they should be open, the dining area is over the top messy, and the people who work there have got to be the dumbest of the dumb. I understand it is fast food, but this is like the bottom of the barrel. They would be the dumbest of the kids with down syndrome.

And they also have about 20 cats that live by the dumpster behind the restaurant. Poor kitties, having to eat KFC to stay alive."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! I ordered from this location on the JustEat website, for delivery. My order was for a bucket of thighs and wings, and popcorn chicken with plum sauce. What I received was a bunch of dry chicken breasts, and the popcorn chicken didn't come with any dipping sauce. I called the restaurant to notify them of this, and they informed me that since I'd already eaten a piece of chicken (I was starving by the time it had arrived), they couldn't do anything about it, but they would send the driver back over with dipping sauce. By the time I received my dipping sauce (90 minutes from when I placed my order), the popcorn chicken was cold. What a waste of time and money! I'll never order from them again!"}
{"text":"The service and food was great. I have not been to a KFC in years and will for sure return to this location. The food was fresh, not greasy and the mashed potatoes were just as I remembered them which is a good thing. Not sure why there are so many negative reviews. Our meal was finger licking good!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to use the bathroom and it was filthy! Inside the bathroom and out. Also the staff was too busy standing around chatting then to help me when I approached the counter to order a drink. 

I hadn't been into one of these places in years, they might have changed my mind about it, but they didn't. 

Gross."}
{"text":"5 meal
5.65 incl tax
The chickens are soggy
Bread not toasted 
Gravy very cheap
But the whole meal is cheap so
I guess its okay"}
{"text":"As far as fast food chicken joints go, this KFC is at the top of the list. The place was renovated in March of 2012 and since then, everything from service to cleanliness has been great. 

I regularly choose this KFC when I do choose any fast food place. 

9/10 I don't have any problems here. But I especially love this one for its friendly staff and managers. 

A young man name Tyler was taking my order and he was just very charismatic and social. He knew the menu well and have excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Drive Thru recommend. Don't go inside. If you had Free Time.  Lol. I pass on this location."}
{"text":"Why 1 Star? Poor customer service and unhealthy. 

1. They gave my Wife crispy chicken and not original as ordered. My wife had to open the box to see it at our table snd her hand hit the chicken when opening the bar. But she took it back up there for them to tell them that they got it wrong, they simply take the chicken out of the box to put her right back in the warmer all the other chicken to give to the next person who comes along. So unhealthy.
2. You need to speak spanish to order here their spanglish is more spanish than english. We had to ask over and over what she was saying. I worked 9 years with 60  employees from all over the world so Im pretty good at deciphering what they asked. This person at KFC is beyond understanding and she made no movement of trying to speak clear. She was also outright rude.  
3. The food was ok? But a mess in the box and they got our order wrong."}
{"text":"This has to be the worse KFC in all of the two world . Honestly I'm surprised there still in business. Out of all the times I've ever visited this location they have never had what I've ordered , either there out or it's a twenty minute wait to make it . They almost always mess up my order and the surprise sucks!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm writing about the nasty KFC at horizon ridge and Stephanie. Couldn't find it on Yelp   Probably because it's the biggest waste of your hour to try to get chicken and God forbid Cole slaw!! At 6 tonight we went there and no chicken ready!! After 20 minutes they told us we could have extra crispy because it would be done quicker. Ok. We settled on that because we have a life and don't want to spend hours at a fast food restaurant. Mind you when we ordered everything now 30 minutes prior we asked for a small Cole slaw. All said and done they ran out of cole slaw!! Really?? Might have ran out of chicken also!! Piece of crap location. The manager in all fairness to him gave us a lemon cake. My husband will take that to work. We hate lemon. Never again will I try this place. Always a problem"}
{"text":"Since when did KFC start serving game hens? I went in to get a couple pieces of chicken only and got the smallest chicken I have ever seen! GO TO POPEYES, they won't screw you. Look at the pic, no photoshop..."}
{"text":"I only been here once, and the AC happened to be busted that day.  It was getting worked on at the time but I must eat, and my lunch break was running out.  So I had to stay.  

The location was a little dirty, the floors were greasy, the loo needed to be cleaned up, and the service was slow.  The staff was friendly though, just slow.

The meal was a great deal!  The chicken itself was artery clogging greasy.  All that grease could of easily slip right through the table....  

Overall a typical fast food joint, don't really see me coming back to this location."}
{"text":"If I had to imagine the most depressing place it is here.  For one thing if you eat here you might just have been at the hospital next door.  If not you might go there for some pain meds after you experience this place. If the chickens used for this food had enough room they would be spinning in their cages at the thought of ending up in such a drab, vile hellhole. If I dropped my chicken and caught it two inches before it hit the floor I would still throw it away just because of the proximity.  The soda machine dispenses the tears of clowns along with pepsi."}
{"text":"Very small location only offering take out & delivery. They are consistent with service & quality and hardly any wait time even when there are 4-5 people waiting in line. 1 person out front and usually 2 in the back. I have never sent anything back.  Never had cold fries. If i don't like certain pieces or like to have more thighs or wings, no hesitation. Just wish it wasn't so expensive for fast food, lol. Thankfully, i only pick up from there once a month."}
{"text":"Recently had to have a quick lunch with my kids and this is what the cookies looked like. Really? KFC can you show your employees how to use the timer?"}
{"text":"I took my daughter to KFC and it was shocking how the uniforms were so dirty at 10:30 am when they just opened and no reason to be dirty.  We walked in and walked right back out because they obviously had a problem with there plumbing.  The smell of sewage was overwhelming! My daughter likes KFC so they get 2 stars for that. Based off of cleanliness it would be no stars."}
{"text":"Today was the second day in a row that this store didnt have crispy fried chicken or crispy chicken strips."}
{"text":"This place gets ZERO Stars! It's 8:30pm on a Sunday. How the hell do a Chicken Place run out of chicken??? The first time hearing this!"}
{"text":"SO SLOOWWWWWWWW. Literally the slowest \"fast food\" drive through I have ever been to."}
{"text":"For fast food I like KFC in general (grilled chicken). This location for some time now seems to hire the most inept of retards. I'm not sure why it takes twice as long to be served here and why the orders almost always seem to be missing an item. I've ventured inside a time or two and it must be the dirtiest KFC in Arizona. Dammit I want a real KFC near my house!"}
{"text":"Trash was overflowing! Literally. The dining room had one couple in it, and unless a busload full of people left moments before we walked in, I can't think of any valid excuse that the trash was overflowing, the tables weren't wiped and there was trash all over the floor. 

The only reason I'm giving two stars is - the chicken was great (we took our order home), the order was right and everything was hot. We got an extra spork in our order (bonus) so I'm not gonna hold the fact that there was no honey packet for the biscuits (its not really honey anyhow, ya know..)

Management - clean up your act."}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow,  waited for over 10 minutes to get a 3 peice meal. Mashes zero sense seeing as the chicken was sitting in the heater the entire time.  Lobby was clean,  and properly stocked."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes in the drive thru line yesterday for one meal. Once we got to the window there was no apology or explanation, they acted as if it was normal. Every time we come here it is usually pretty slow, but it seems to get worse every time. They seem to need new management."}
{"text":"Whoa... all of the negative reviews are true! I came here today to meet a client. As they patiently waited in line, you could hear what i think was the manager yelling at the cashier. The cashier looked scared and nervous. Apparently she had made a mistake on someone's order and needed to do a refund. Mind you, she was the only cashier and it was lunch time. 

The lady that i think was the manager, loudly complained when she saw a line of men getting ready to enter the restaurant. The line ended up stretching to the door. After all this, when my client finally got his food, it was totally wrong. 

Save your money and go elsewhere. You'll thank me."}
{"text":"The best thing I noticed about this location was that the staff was excellent. They were fast, courteous, and accurate.

The restaurant was clean and free from clutter. I'm sure this was no easy feat due to this being after the lunch rush. 

My only issue is the super small pieces of chicken that I received in my meal. It was almost comical. I don't blame the staff for this though. Maybe they are selling the steroid free chicken and I'm just used to the \"bad\" stuff. Although small, the taste was good. My co-workers enjoyed their meals, as well.

As far as KFC's go, this location is a winner."}
{"text":"Eric is AMAZING!!! He was there to help when we thought we were forgotten about!! This is the KFC to go to in Vegas!!! Ask for Eric!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The rudest customer service I have ever experienced!!!
Don't know how they stay in business."}
{"text":"Worst KFC I ever been to !!! asking for extra honey mustard . They just ignored me . Must be expensive ! I guess I will bring business somewhere else."}
{"text":"Good location on Chandler Blvd off the 101 freeway. Drive through moves pretty fast and chicken is made fresh. Mashed potatoes, cole slaw and biscuits are awesome. I also like that they have grilled chicken."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Sat in drive thru for over 10 minutes and nobody came to serve us three cars in line."}
{"text":"If there was an option for a 0/5 stars this place would have earned it. I ordered my food with no line and no other customers only to wait 20 minutes to find out that my
Order won't be ready for another 25 minutes, I asked to see a manager and was greeted 5 mins later with the money I had used to purchase the meal, without so much as a word from the manager. 0 stars for sure."}
{"text":"Not too sure of their menu in the drive thru, we decided on a 4 piece meal with 2 sides
for my friend and I.  $7.49 plus $1 extra for one being a breast comes out to about $10 total.  I get the stuff, get home and ready for our meal, and there is 2 pieces of chicken.  I called the store.  

They kid told me they asked the girl that packed it --- and she said she packed it right.  (Uh...no, cause we're looking at 2 pieces of chicken)...

I disputed that as did my friend next to me, and he said there was nothing they could do for me.  I asked him to credit my card so as not to drive back 6 miles for 2 pieces of chicken, he said he wouldn't.  

He would have the manager call me next day.  Manager doesn't call me and basically KFC just screws you--without remorse.  My suggestion is check your order if you go there, it's probably not right, and they won't care if it's not.

Value...BAD...I could have bought 2 roasted chickens for the price, and I didn't like being treated at 61, like I'm out to \"take\" KFC for 2 pieces of chicken that I didn't already pay for.

In my business if a customer complained they were shorted, I made it right, right away...it's not worth the bad will to turn away a customer.

So the morale....Count your chickens from KFC...they don't."}
{"text":"I don't know if they changed their popcorn chicken recipe or if someone messed with the seasoning because it had a very strong onion powder flavor and I didn't care for it. It wasn't the peppery taste I remember. The potato wedges seemed different too... I wasn't happy with this meal. Should've gone to Raising Cane's."}
{"text":"Based on past experiences with this particular KFC, I knew I was taking a chance by coming here and expected something to go wrong. I sat at the drive thru for a little while and a lady's voice came through the speaker and asked me to continue waiting. Several minutes later, she came back and said, \"Just to let you know, we got no mashed potatoes.\" I said, \"Well okay then!\" and drove away laughing. This is the worst KFC in existence. LOL"}
{"text":"Got the $5 Fill Up w/ Popcorn Nuggets, mashed potatoes, a biscuit, and a cookie. There was no iced tea at the drink station so we had to wait at the counter for awhile before someone acknowledged us to get some tea from the dispenser at the drive-thru. Then they had to search around for some of the sauces we asked for (i.e. BBQ, butter, and honey). Food was decent, about what you expect from KFC, although my b/f got one of the tiniest drumsticks I think I have ever seen. He should have taken it back, but they were getting ready to close so they probably weren't making any more. They had already locked up by the time we left. The guy working actually thanked us for wiping down the table since most people just leave a mess behind..."}
{"text":"A simple order #5--it's on their menu board outside and inside. 2-piece leg & thigh...well, they couldn't even get that right. When I got home, they gave me a leg and a dried up half-breast. No wonder the place always looks empty."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to visit the new KFC on State Road. My family has missed their fried chicken. Not only was our bucket of extra crispy simply let delicious, the staff is wonderful. Chantel took my order. What a delightful young lady with the greatest smile. I had to wait on the potatoes, and received a free small lemon n cake for my inconvenience. Wonderful food & first rate service. Thank you KFC."}
{"text":"Horrible place to eat. Don't do it. Just don't. Worst KFC I've ever visited. Boarded up broken windows, glass on remaining windows are disgustingly filthy. Tables and floors are disgusting. Entire place needs a sanitary cleaning. The food tasted horrible - I could taste it was all cooked in nasty grease that hasn't been changed or cleaned. I couldn't even eat the meal it tasted so gross. It will be a long time before I'll go to KFC again, and NEVER this one."}
{"text":"I ordered a 3 piece meal and the pieces I was given were so extremely small I actually went and asked for a refund. It was truly a joke, they are serving anorexic chicken or something. I've never had such a poor experience at KFC but they are doing some funny business practices to save $$$$."}
{"text":"So the restaurant is open until 11pm, it's currently 10pm. I was informed by the clerk that \"there are only 8 wings and 1 drumstick left\" ...which makes me think why even be open until 10pm? Irritated and hungry."}
{"text":"GROSS! I went through the drive thru but had to go in because after waiting 10 mins my food  was still not done. Don't go in. It's filthy! Grease everywhere. Thick old grease. They hadn't even started my order. ....glad I didn't keep waiting. ...and threw it all in a bucket. I ordered extra crispy and got extra greasy. I think I pissed then off because my food was all smashed when I got home. 
If you want fried chicken and you are on the area, go to fry's on Val Vista. Hot, crispy and fresh. 

What happened to kfc? Ugh not returning."}
{"text":"Food was good the female staff can act a little bossy towards customers if you can get pass that your in for a good meal well I mean it is fast food"}
{"text":"Restaurant#D212101 Ticket #1879 Cashier Christine & Mg Angie 
Christine took my order and Angie handed me the food. Angie forgot to give me the honey, butter, potato wedges and my diet Pepsi. When I walked into the Restaurant I told the man at the register about everything that was missing. Angie heard what I had said but never apologized. Instead she looked at me and began to speak in her native \"Tagalog\" language and all the Filipino employees started laughing. I am certain she insulted me in her language.It was very embarrassing and almost bully like. It even made the young man at the register uncomfortable. He apologized and brought me what was missing. I'm writing this letter because this is the 2nd time in the past 5 days that Angie has made a mistake and never apologizes. Today was unexceptionable. She has no managerial skills and the way I was treated today is a poor representation of this location and it's management staff. I live down the street and I will NEVER eat at KFC again. Today she won by embarrassing me but you lost a customer forever! You will never earn my business again. Someone should secretly shop her so you know that I'm not making this up.  She's the worst employee I have ever come across at KFC. And the fact the she's the manager makes this disturbing and ridiculous.  It's not fair for her to treat customers like this. If sales are down I would start with investigating her behavior and removing her from this position. Small minded people with authority can negatively impact the brand and overall business if this franchise/organization."}
{"text":"Sooo disappointed. 3 times through drive thru and the order is NEVER right. I ordered fries got mashed potatoes,ordered crispy got original!!! After working all week my treat is Friday night order out...i called to speak with mgmt rang over 4 minutes each time so I took to yelp. Canes opened a few miles down longer drive but at least I will get what I paid for."}
{"text":"8:50 pm on Monday and we are told \"limited items available -- NO CHICKEN\".  No offer of waiting for chicken... just no chicken.  (I would not even give this one star but it won't let me post without it)"}
{"text":"9:15 pm Drive thru service was polite, prompt and easy to order.  Food came up fast & hot.  Chicken tenders were cooked just right (hot, fresh, tender & juicy on inside, crispy on the outside)
 Pot pie was delicious.   Thank you!"}
{"text":"This KFC is fast when you need a quick bucket of chicken for some surprise guests.  They're on their toes and the prices are reasonable.

{"text":"It took one hour to get macaroni and mashed potatoes. When they finally gave it to us the order was incorrect"}
{"text":"I have a review of one star at a different KFC location (The one on 10000 block of west Charleston) but this location had the freshest tastiest chicken I have ever had. Service was timely and courteous. I would drive out of my way for this location rather than go to the one in my neighborhood (Summerlin). Kudos to the management)"}
{"text":"Grilled chicken has been discontinued, that seems to have solved their problem the last few times I went there the food was fresh and service prompt"}
{"text":"So... it's 8:15 on a Sunday in Las Vegas and you want some chicken fingers or maybe a chicken sandwich... not unless you want to wait 15 minuets for it to be made... it the middle of dinner shift, why are we waiting for FAST food?!? The fingers were so skimpy the last time I probably dodged a bad meal... no third time to disappoint"}
{"text":"My experience with this location was good.  Then Sunday 10/18/15 we called to order a 8 piece order.  We wanted to upgrade 6 pieces to breasts.  We expected to pay maybe .75 to $1.00 each piece which has been normal.  The response $2.00 each piece.  When questioned they were emphatic.  $2.00?  Yes. I will do what I can to spread the word on KFC and it is terrible in customer service.  

Eat here.  I won't"}
{"text":"This is the worst KFC and it does have completion.  As another review said.  I have tried for over 3 years to go here.  Even complained to KFC Corp., and the manager called and a couple of times it was okay.  Then got worse and even REFUSED to even upgrade if we were willing to pay.  At least the store at 19th and Union Hills wanted to charge $2.00 a piece to upgrade.

KFC used to be one of my favorite places.  In time their lousy customer service will catch up.  Sad probably some good employees will lose a job they need"}
{"text":"Some of the sweetest staff around. Laura is amazing. Treat me with utmost sincerity. I really do appreciate when I recieve excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Poor customer service, dirty, and out of chicken. This is the third time I've been to this location. Each time, the employees have either been rude or have ignored paying customers. In addition, two of the three times they have been out of chicken."}
{"text":"Hadn't ate here in years, was starving, decided to give it another try. Went through drive thru last Saturday. Ordered a chicken strip meal and the cashier repeated it back and then said oops you wanted the chicken tenders and here I am trying to give you the other chicken. Mistakes happen, I understand, I worked in fast food before. Had to mention chicken strips instead of the regular bone chicken about 3 times before the cashier repeated back chicken strips, so we thought we were rang up correctly. We got to the window and there were two ladies in the drive thru area. Paid $17 for 2 small meals and a side of mac and cheese. When I got home and opened my meal it was bone in chicken. The only thing that tasted decent was the mashed potatoes. No receipt showing what we ordered was provided, just the debit receipt for what was charged to my card. Never again. I should have stuck with Chick-fila."}
{"text":"I ordered number 1 
four ultimate chicken piece from here. All the chicken tasted old like nothing and also if you buy number 1, it comes with a free Cookie but  they didn't give me one. 
Poor customer service 
I will never go there again I don't recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch, food was good biscuit was dry but fast service"}
{"text":"I cheat one night a week on my diet, & Im so disappointed I chose KFC last night... Never Again! Check your order before driving away, the staff forgot 2 of our sides we paid for which I guess ended up for the best considering the rest of our order tasted disgusting. Such a waste of $30 & our time! We should've just went to Chili's...."}
{"text":"Would love to have a conversation with the franchise owner. It's obvious after a few visits that the employees run the show here and care little to nothing about the guests. It's rare that they have a selection of chicken in stock plus I worked at a KFC in the past a know the prep times are less than half what they've quoted. Lazy and rude.....hopefully the owner hit the lottery and just doesn't care. Otherwise, it's time to clean house.

Normally wouldn't post a review for a KFC but I'm tired of searching for the owner's email.....maybe they'll find me"}
{"text":"Worst service ever at a drive through. Female at window did not let me finish my order. Kept saying they were out of everything. Had to back up and try to finish order three times. Kept yelling \"what?\" At us.  Will definitely never go back."}
{"text":"Horrible service I don't know how they stay open? Every time we try to go there they are out of food or the customer service sucks! New management is needed bad"}
{"text":"I know KFC isn't the classiest place to go, but I would at least expect decent service 

I have visited this location a handful and times, and I have never once received the correct order. When I go inside and ask for the correct items, I am greeted with nasty looks from the woman who took my order, repeated it back to me, and still got it wrong. 

Might as well go inside instead of the drive through because you'll have to go in anyways."}
{"text":"We went Sunday Nov. 10th at around 2:30 pm.  We first arrived and waited our turn.  Then it's our turn. I tell the cashier we would like a 10 piece meal, and we have a coupon for a free cake with that.  The lady takes my coupon, looks at it, & looks some more.  Then she looks at me and says \"that's the 10 piece feast, not the meal.\" I'm struck dumb, ??? \"what?\" I say.  She says \"you can't get a free cake with the ten piece meal, it comes with the feast.\"  I say \"that coupon is for a free cake when I order the ten piece meal.\" Again she looks at me and with clear attitude this time tells me \" I don't know how you expect to get a free cake! It doesn't come with the meal only the feast.!\" I say to her \"easy, with that coupon you are holding that says I GET A FREE CAKE WITH THE PURCHASE OF A 10 PIECE MEAL!\"  I couldn't believe this lady! I then ask her to go get someone that can help me because clearly she cant! She walks off, & comes back about 3 minutes later, looks at me & says \"$20.98\" I say \"20.98 is for what?\" She says \"your meal!\" I then tell her I so hope that my receipt comes with one of those survey links on the back because I am so taking it!  Needless to say I didn't get a receipt! 
As for cleanliness, the women's restroom was NOT clean. The lobby was clean.  The service was extremely slow too.  One guy tells the front cash lady don't worry about your ten piece meal, I got it for you.  Fifteen minutes later we're still standing there.  She looks at the guy & says \"hey, where's my meal?\" He says \"Oh I got busy getting drive thru's food.\"

THE END"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a negative review, I would. The older woman with cool aid hair working in the drive through had absolutely no customer service skills. My partner even told her to smile in which she didn't. We had to pull up to the front to wait for our food which is fine but just the lack of customer service by all staff was ridiculous. We sent her back in twice for the basics, i.e. Napkins.  They definitely do not deserve that 10 dollars an hour!"}
{"text":"It's too bad you cannot give zero stars because this is how they rate. 
First of all customer service is horrible. When I walked in I was not greeted, employees standing around the restroom talking to friends. 
When I approached the counter I was look at like what the heck do you want. 
I place my order was never looked at or think. 
I ask for a receipt was told it will be in the bag like I was asking for something special. By the way it was never in the bag. 
Was handed my food employee turned around and went back to do something else never ask if I needed anything else. 

Since I never got the receipt to call them back I did call corporate and left a message on their voicemail, and I filled out a report online.

I got a callback from corporate I told him that went went on and what had happened and they took the information down and thank me for my call.

I then got a call from someone that called yourself the district manager scolded me for calling and talking to corporate. Never said she was sorry. Never offered a replacement meal. Just basically told me that I should not call corporate again.

I've been called corporate again and let them know that I got a call from someone that scolded me for calling and reporting this to them. They told me that I would not be contacted by the store or anybody again and that they were very sorry.

I then got a call from the owner who seemed very irritated that I called corporate to begin with, that I did not like what her district manager had told me, and that I was only trying to get a free meal. That she would only offer me this meal ones and that if I ever got food that wasn't satisfactory again I need to bring it back to her. Basically telling me that the only reason I was complaining was to get a free meal. I told her that I did not want the free meal that I would never be back to her store again and she could take a free meal and keep it. Basically telling me that I was a liar that her food in her service was great. From reading these complaints online I see that this is a common practice of shorting people food and delivering bad service as well as bad food. I would recommend nobody ever go to the store or this corporation as they are rude disrespectful. Do not go to this cut store at any cost there are plenty other great chicken places around that are happy to help you and give you great service"}
{"text":"After getting my wisdom teeth removed my boyfriend and I thought to get KFC mashed potatoes and mac and cheese since they are typically soft and easy to eat. The mashed potatoes were great no issues there but the mac and cheese was hard and inedible with my condition. We went through drive thru and they rushed us after we asked for a moment and once getting to the window to pay ther cashier was rude. Never once did she say thank you or ask us how we were. Pretty bad customer service."}
{"text":"Food always taste fresh,and hot.Good customers  service ,always eat there twice a week"}
{"text":"Wow!  How hard can it be to order 6 pieces of chicken and two sides.  After numerous attempts, the manager had to come over and take the order. Never again KFC."}
{"text":"5:30pn and only 3 people working!!!! Waited in the lobby over ten minutes to be served, the lady was friendly but still management needs to staff better."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Their cleanliness standards are below even the seediest of Chinese restaurants. Everything that you touch is sticky. It's always a 20+ minute wait for chicken, even during dinner rush. They couldn't plan to have food ready to save their lives. To top it all off, the staff, and especially the managers, are rude. I'm done trying to go back here. Not worth it by a long shot."}
{"text":"This place blows! Chicken tenders looked like they were microwaved! Definetly not fried!"}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say. I was here at noon they had a wait in chicken the staff was rude no manager to be found 3 of us who were all waiting in one walked out"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waited forever. They were rude as well. Work on attitude. The person before me waited a while as well and we had to keep saying hello at the order screen. Won't be back."}
{"text":"5 years ago, KFC gravy used to be the one I most like, but after this meal that I got tonight, NO THANKS, so oily! I wonder how many cups of oil did they put in there? a visible layer of oil, YUCK. Oh and, now I know what KFC categorize on dark meat and white meat, where is my drumstick that KFC used to have, is it disappear completely? dark meat is thigh, and white is breast. God, if I knew all this, I would just order my Popeyes!!!! Delivery is $5 charge, whereas Popeyes chicken is free delivery... I should listen to my guts."}
{"text":"Where to start with this horrible KRC ?

I ordered 2 of the big box combos:

Over cooked chicken
Burnt biscuits
Mashed potatoes and gravy were cold
Mac and cheese was okay
Coleslaw was old

Employees are rude and VERY slow.

If you look at the reviews you see a pattern with this location and sadly the owner(s) don't care.

Sad because the commercials make it look so good but the staff can not deliver, even a smile.

Waiting till Monday then contacting corporate and asking them to take the time to look at yelp to see that this franchise location is pathetic."}
{"text":"So today I stopped in to get my normal famous bowl, and usually when you get a famous bowl everything is suppose to be evenly proportional. Well, my bowl was mostly corn and mashed potatoes. I definitely would have loved to have actually had some chicken, cheese, and gravy in there too. So far this is the only location I've been too that doesn't make a good famous bowl. It made me sad!"}
{"text":"My order was fast and food was okay. However I wanted to leave right away because of the smell, old fish shop smell. There was no outside sitting so I ate fast as I can and left. Some sittings were tore up too."}
{"text":"Walked in smelled like formalyahide  walked right back out didn't even bother to order food ugh!"}
{"text":"Went to this KFC a couple years ago, extremely understaffed and the service was so behind. We waited because we already paid..

Now, we haven't been back there for a couple years. Thought it must be better now.. Well didn't even get to try it. Yesterday was cash only day. Definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"Too many bad experiences to ignore. By far the worst kfc I've visited and I love kfc. Too many experiences of long waiting for store order so I thought I would try delivery. After about ten minutes I called to make a small change to the order and was told order was already left. Ok. Fifty minutes later the guy arrived. My order was freezing. Driver said it should be ok. He took out the French fries, stone cold. Chicken won't be cold he said. Really. Bs. Sent it back. Tonight my friend arrived With kfc. Eight piece bucket. Four legs, two wings , one breast and one thigh. Grease soaked pathetic chicken pieces. Never thought to tell her don't go to the one at Hurontario and Steele's. Too late. She did. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We live very close to this KFC and when you need something quick, you would think this would be the perfect place to go to.  Our order has been wrong the last 2 out of 3 times.  Every time we order chicken (its in the name of the place!) we are told it will be another 6 minutes which doesn't seem like that long, but it is a fast food place!  They then tell us to pull around and park in their parking lot and they will bring it to us.  It has gotten to the point that if we still go there, we actually look at the receipt to see what time we ordered, and on average...we get the food around the 12 minute mark, which is a good ticket time at an actual sit down restaurant.  Our last visit we forgot to check the food before we got home, and it was wrong once again.  My wife took the bag back to KFC and was greeted by an unapologetic, rude manager who made it seem to be our fault.  As much as we like KFC, it is getting tougher and tougher to keep going back with a downward spiral in customer service"}
{"text":"Now I see why these reviews are so bad. I thought I'd give it a chance since we were in the area despite what I read below, and long and behold we were not pleased being only one of two in the drive threw lane and no one in the restaurant we wait quit sometime just to get home with our order that was wrong missing many items, wrong sauces and over all not happy with our experience. Cashier was kind but I would have rather her check my order and not have us wait so long. Tips. Check your order before leaving this location."}
{"text":"Showed up an hour before close and they told me they weren't dropping anymore chicken and that the only chicken they have left was what's available. So your telling me you starting cleaning the fryers an hour before close and tell the customers basically what they can order??? MAN!!?? Ridiculous. I am a paying customer and you wanna dictate what Im ordering because you want to get out exactly when they close? Shenanigans .. Also, Id rather them drop fresh chicken then eat what they had out for only god knows how long. Regardless of the time, If your asking a paying customer to pick from the leftovers, expect an unsatisfied  customer. 


Update:: Getting numerous threatening messages about my experience. Name calling ect, I'm only assuming it's from employees there. I've had multiple messages since last night from multiple people. Each person also went on and gave 4 or 5 star reviews after mine, coincidence? I think not. Disappointing to say the least. Regardless what my personal experience was, to be called numerous names and to feel threatened is just un called for. I'll be contacting corporate KFC as well as Yelp to have the profiles looked into."}
{"text":"Super high prices for chicken and non of the food has a fresh taste. Taste like it's been sitting under the heater for a while. The biscuits are hard enough to be used as baseballs.   Been here once and they were out of a few things. For as much as it cost i expect more. Do yourself a favor and go to any grocery store and get chicken and sides for half the prices."}
{"text":"8pm on a Thurs night and they're OUT OF CHICKEN! Lmao!!! What a joke. Oh well technically they have tenders available. Pfffft. Can they shut this location down and give us an El Pollo Loco please?"}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm writing this. My friend Rob wanted to take me to KFC. I was less than thrilled, but Keke, who worked the counter totally made the experience. Food was fresh, hot, and tasty. She was very friendly and attentive. She was like that with everyone. They are lucky to have her. It's been 25 years since I've been to KFC, but after today, it's bye bye Popeyes. For once, a place that cares about more than just the drive thru. Thank you Keke."}
{"text":"This place is so dirty, to be honest. Food is a hit or miss, mostly a miss. Don't order for delivery unless you prepare yourself to wait for 1h30m."}
{"text":"OMG - this place just can't get things right! My takeout order was screwed up twice! The first time I got to the car and checked - it was wrong. Went back in, what I could see of the second order of chicken looked right. I got home and emptied the bucket only to discover the wrong, seriously over cooked chicken!!! I called to discuss the issue with the manager. I was very polite to her - and she was as rude and argumentative as she could possibly be to me. I kindly asked for her name so when I go back to get my correct order, I'd know who to ask for. There was dead silence, I asked again and she hung up on me! All she had to do was say sorry about that, just come in and we'll get you taken care of!!! 

I had my reservations about stopping at this location tonight. It's been over a year since we've dined here. We quit stopping here because they never got our order right and the service was just awful!!! (Nothing different, except new low level help) Well, I was overly optimistic & gave them another shot. I will not be back!!!"}
{"text":"Nope. 

Just nope.

I came here a few weeks ago after having a fried chicken craving (please keep your jokes to yourself lool) and I decided to get a chicken tender meal which was a huge mistake. Upon ordering my food and getting to the window, the cashier leaned out and told me that he would not sell me the french fries....\"why?\" I asked. He informed me that they had been sitting under the heat lamp for a while and looked really bad. Him telling me this was nice...but it really put me off and made me just want to leave. The meal itself was not good at all and every time I come here I get disappointed...maybe it's time to give KFC up for good..."}
{"text":"i'm so angry they are always out of food and they never have anything ever I went to get a potato bowl and they told me they they were out of mashed potatoes then when I tried to substitute them for a another alternative they told me that they couldn't do that and when I asked for just chicken strips they were also out of those I will never spend my money here ever"}
{"text":"Been here a few times in the past two months and each time the service has been absolutely terrible! Each time I get an order for two for carry out and it takes 40-60 minutes, so ridiculous!! Last time I had waited for over 30 minutes before they came and told me that they didn't have the Mac n cheese that I ordered and everything they had was frozen and wouldn't be ready until tomorrow. This time I waited in line and finally ordered and they wouldn't honor my coupon I received in the mail a couple days ago. They said that one wasn't in their system and wouldn't honor it. I've had it with the slow wait times and horrible service from this location and will NEVER be back! I strongly suggest saving yourself the heartache and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Each of the previous reviews before me mention something that I considered posting in my review of this place. The staff is never happy, the food is always incorrect and you can guarantee your wait time to be at least 8 to 10 minutes on a good day, regardless of how many people are in line or waiting in the lobby. I've written this entire review since placing my order while sitting in the drive thru, and there are still two cars ahead of me, even after one car gave u and left the line. 

All right, only two problems with my order today other than the fact that it's taken this long for me to receive it. My side of sour cream that Specifically ordered was not included in the bag that was given to me, I had to remind the  young man about it when I arrived at the window. I also just pulled away to pull over and finish this review and realized I never received my receipt!  So, I can't actually check and make sure my order is correct as it was placed. 

It never fails... Which is super disappointing! It's unfortunate I love Taco Bell so much and this is the only one in the area, so regardless of how I feel and my expectations,  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Today we are craving fried chicken.  I am not a big KFC fan, but my hubby wanted to try it and they were having a bucket sale, so we stopped in.  Why this location?  We just happened to be on that side of town.

We got the bucket deal, half regular recipe and half extra crispy.  We got two sides, biscuits and drinks  The food came out quickly, was fresh and nicely cooked.  We enjoyed the meal and had left overs for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a minus star point I would.  They are the WORST.  Twice I have placed an order at the drive-in window only  to discover when I got home it was the WRONG order.  Who, after a busy day, is going to drive all the way back to get the order straight.  In addition, now KFC is serving \"honey sauce\" instead of Honey with their biscuits.  WHAT a horrible place to purchase food.  Someone needs to teach their employees the parts of a chicken so when you order a chicken breast you get one.  I paid the extra price and I deserve to have what I paid for.  Forget calling, they only have an answering machine and NO ONE ever returns your calls."}
{"text":"OMG--where is the quality control for this place? All the previous complaints are valid AND THE CHICKEN IS TERRIBLE. I am not young & have been a huge fan of KFC since I was a kid. We come here for the winter & I make the mistake every year of thinking I can take care of my KFC craving here. Nope--not gonna happen. Pieces are small, dry, overcooked and greasy. It tastes like old chicken. I bought a bucket, choked down one piece and dumped the rest. What does it take to get this place fixed?"}
{"text":"Clowns run this store. Ordered a 12pc tender combo w/ mac n cheese and mashed potatoes. First off, on a Friday afternoon, they don't have any m/c ready. So, 10 minutes and $20 later, I ask for a large ice water and they argue with me at the window while trying to hand me a child sized drink stating \"you wanted a water cup,\" then trying to charge me for a large cup. Really, are you that petty? 

Don't nickel and dime your paying customer."}
{"text":"omg.... the worst kfc ever... waited 20 mins for hotwings... i ordered 40 pieces the half asses only cooked 10 to order. and the excuses they had for thier bs on the clock... i suggest you learn how to count and read.... customer service is needed asap.... you represent your food chain poorly.... refund my money bitch..."}
{"text":"Less than impressive! Order took over 20 mins (fast food?) and had to wait for them to make biscuits during dinner hours 6pm. When I got home, my kids  where playing with all the biscuits because they were still doughy and able to stretch like play dough. I would consider another place to eat as the chicken had soggy fried skin. If they can't get the biscuits right, I can only imagine what they are doing with the chicken."}
{"text":"Clean.  Updated.  Not too busy, the people at this location actually provide customer service too.  We ordered the $5 fill up box and they had it ready within a minute for my family..   I'll be returning to this location.  Most other in the valley are sketch our way outdated."}
{"text":"I would like to add no stars, but there is not an optician here. We were there today at 11am only one other couple there they didn't get the chicken it was over cooked so when I ordered the boneless chicken the lady taking my order  wanted me to take there dried one, wow couldn't believe that . It took 20 mints to get out order, but they didn't have any bisques ready it would take 12 min to get them the place is very slow. For it being slow, and no customers all the tables were sticky and dirty my wife asked them to clean them they never did my wife got paper towels and  cleaned our table. The floor is very dirty and sticky! I will never go back there Sam Brown"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service... forgot the guy at the drive thru s name but he was great  and made us laugh. 
 Its kfc I know what I'm getting an it's always good!!! 
Its convinently located and makes the car smell good"}
{"text":"So I ordered two large family meals for a company function. 

24 pieces of chicken, and six large sides. 

Once the order was ready I asked them for some ranch and BBQ.

They handed me, two sides of ranch and two sides of BBQ. 

Are you kidding me?! All of this and you give me four sauces? 

I guess my company is just going to share the dipping sauce. Unbelievable. 

Get your ish together, there was only two people in the place and no lines in the drive through. 

SMH ?"}
{"text":"I have nothing but positivity for this location. My order always comes correct unless they added something extra by mistake such as an extra Mac and cheese. The staff at the drive thru seems to always be in a great mood and happy to serve you. That alone is the sole reason I continue to go there. The quality of the food always taste great. The zinger sandwich is my new favorite chicken sandwich. This include Chick-fil-A! They never complain when you ask for sauce or act like it's bothersome to give you sauce."}
{"text":"We stopped by KFC for a afternoon snack cup comprised of chicken tenders and wedge fries. Well the order was taken pretty quickly but the wait for the order was not!
We waited almost 10 minutes for our order which by the way was hot and fresh!  My only issue is when a fast food establishment is no longer providing \"fast food\" and the consumer is unconvinced the establishment should compensate the consumer by offering desert, a coupon or something for the thank you inconvenience... IJS!"}
{"text":"So I went through KFC today get the boys a snack cup! There was no line and the food came out very quick and believe it or not it was hot! 

The only problem was the size of the Pettit chicken tenders that came in the cup!  Judging by the size of the tenders that came it the cup, I think the chicken was on a diet but the fries were huge so the potatoes were on steroids and they made up for the scrawny little chicken tenders!"}
{"text":"KFC is a chicken restaurant, right????  Then why is it that two out of three times I have gone  there, they have NO chicken????  Seriously.....it's 8:30 pm and they only have dark meat!!  Doesn't seem to matter what time I go, they never have what I want.  Poor management to always be running out of food!!!  This location is horrible!!  Not to mention the fact that as expensive as the food is here, they still charge you for condiments.  Ridiculous!!!"}
{"text":"KFC has really gone down hill, I went here to get a $10 value meal they had on the KFC website. I asked for the meal and they said they didn't have it. I told them to give me a 3 piece meal crispy instead. They said they didn't have that in crispy chicken. So I got regular, the chicken looked like it was malnourished. It looked like I was eating a cornish  hen I don't see how corporate KFC can let this type of service and quality of food keep going this way. Maybe they should spend some of the advertising money on their restaurants."}
{"text":"It's been long a time since I order their chicken but when I did their chicken seems like are getting smaller and expensive. No more chicken only"}
{"text":"bad place to go! 15 seconds walk from my house(YES), but I DONT ever go! Just worst food ever! Bad service too, when I asked some questions about items, they were so annoyed n gave me hard time. Lst weekend when my friend came to visit me, he grabbed some quick wraps, then 20 min later he had intense stomach pain. And he was like:\"I don't feel very social right now!\" LOL. yes he went home right there. What the heck, was suppose to go coffee n walk around downtown. lol For that KFC sucks because it carries Taco Bell lol."}
{"text":"Easily the worst experience I had any fast food restaurant. I went last night at about 8:30 and I stood there for five minutes waiting for one of the three employees in there to acknowledge me. 
The store wasn't busy at all, there was one car at the drive-thru window and one person eating in the dining room. During the coarse of my time there all three employees made eye contact with me but ignored me. I even tried getting their attention but to now avail, they seemed to be more interested in talking among themselves. 
The restaurant closed at 10:30pm on Sunday nights, but when I was there they had already shut down their equipment,hosed down their floors, and even had some lights in the dining room off as if they were already closed.
After about the forth or fifth attempt to get someone to help me I ended up walking out."}
{"text":"I wish that I had read their reviews before my purchase there last evening.  I ordered at the drive thru and was told that there would be a sixteen to eighteen minute wait for extra-crispy chicken; I agreed and drove to the window.  After thirty-five minutes the \"team-member\" brought my order to the window.  I saw the sign on the window which states \"you will receive a five-dollar gift certificate if you do not receive a receipt with your order\".  Looking through the bag to make sure that I had received exactly what i had ordered, I saw that I dd not receive a receipt and knocked on the window to ask for the gift certificate.  Another team-member answered my knock and after listening to my request, called the original team-member over, who I again explained the request too.  She stated \"I am not giving you a gift card\", pulled my receipt from the register and thrust it through the window at me.  Extremely rude customer service.  Luckily there are so many food service business' in Las Vegas that I can state without a doubt that I will NEVER purchase anything from KFC again."}
{"text":"Ok KFC \"who ever that works at KFC that care\"

The food is good.

Dining room is great.

Customer service was great also.

My food came quick but a guy ahead of me that ordered 10 wings didn't get his order till I was done eating and he was ahead of me :(

Why 2 stars?

Just please read this and read it well as I'm 
addressing this to you KFC:


Lines are too long.

Lunch time is not the time to put a rookie on the register.

Why you have no napkins by the fountain machine? Why do you I have to wait for people to clear the register so I can grab a napkin?

Where is the Dole Lemonade that you advertise? Why it is not at the fountain? Do I have to stand in those long lines again to get a lemonade? Well I didn't have time so I ended up with some Sobe watery drink from the fountain :$

The jalapeño pepper I suggest you move that from customer reach, I wanted one but the lady ahead of me squeezed every single one before I could grab one. I don't want one now after she touched it and squeezed with her un sanitized hands.


The fountain machine was dirty and the drink selector was so old you can't read the drink name anymore.
Why so ran down for such a new building and a nice dining room?


What a shame, I'll come back I love KFC and will see if you guys care :)

Chicken was good thanks!

$5 fill is an ok deal,  just don't reduce your two. Hi ken piece to one breast because you will leave hungry, their breasts are small."}
{"text":"Double-down deliciousness!

Aside from that, this location is pretty good. I find the drive-thru to be a little slow but if you go inside it's generally a good experience. When you ask for lots of hot sauce, they give you LOTS of hot sauce."}
{"text":"This is a tiny KFC. It's a little confusing walking in as there are a set of doors to get you in and a set to get you out. I can't see the use of this system as there doesn't seem to be a large enough crowd to warrant this kind of crowd control.

I was picking up lunch for the office so I ordered a family meal. The person at the counter was friendly and had us quickly out the door so we could rush back to the office to devour out tasty grease fest."}
{"text":"This is an old location.  Hopefully with the recent announcements that KFC will be doing upgrades to their Canadian restaurants this will be one of them"}
{"text":"Very standard experience here. The food was quickly prepared and the service was friendly and warm. I had the original chicken sandwich combo and got exactly what I expected."}
{"text":"I went in tonight to try the Double Down for the first time. They were out of the cheese that normally comes on it so they were making them with Kraft Singles. Seriously! You could see the guy making the sandwich unwrapping each individual slice of \"cheese\". 

Despite having four people working tonight the service was extremely slow. The cashier had to go talk to the food preparer after every order for some reason. The cashier didn't get my order right, though it was to my advantage. I wanted the Double Down and a drink, but not the combo. He charged me for the sandwich but no the drink and still gave me a cup.

The worst part of the experience was that there was a guy eating a piece of chicken in the food prep area.  I'm not sure if he was on break or what was going on but that shouldn't happen. Totally disgusting."}
{"text":"Went inside to get food for carry out, Got home and ate was pretty good, a little greasy and the buns were hard, Lid had come off of gravy and made a mess. No napkins or sporks, Put left overs in the fridge, ate for lunch the next day and found a black curly hair in the breading of my chicken, WE WILL NEVER GO AGAIN  NASTY"}
{"text":"This review is for two things: My meal, and the level of service that I got from this particular address.

First let's cover the meal selection: After months of Facebook mentions from friends, popular media jokes and articles, speed eating contests and every reported media what have you, I decided to try the \"Double Down\" sandwich.  You know the one: Two pieces of chicken that have some sort of sauce, cheese and bacon between each breast like some sort of unholy abomination.  I had described it elsewhere as it being the equivalent of taking your stomach to a brothel, and ending up getting \"The Ugly One\" for your digestive tract.  It's... I'll explain more later.

The service?  I should have known what I was in for when the girl didn't turn off the drive-in microphone and started whining to her co-workers.  I should have further known in seeing the \"Love/Hate\" tattoos emblazoned on said server, because I guess while I should have found it endearing that someone had given her the apparent impression that this inkage choice was still somehow trendy and relevant in the 2010's, I couldn't help but realize that the someone who had made this opinion known was a liar.

I was told that my meal was to take 7 minutes to prepare.  Okay, fine.  I hate waiting to the side at any fast food place, but I wasn't in a hurry.  One minute turned to seven.  Seven minutes turned to twenty.

It doesn't take a meteorologist to know that sitting in Vegas' lovely 100+ degree Summers is not fun for nearly half an hour.  But I was going to be cool (pun not intended) about it, go inside, and just ask about the status of my food.

So in I go (the other pet peeve I hate about the \"pull over and wait\" tactic), and present another girl my receipt to inquire about the status of my order.  The original girl saw me and had that pissed look of \"Oh no he didn't\" at me.  \"It will be ready in a minute\", she snapped at me.  \"Fine\", I responded  \"It was just too hot for me to sit outside.\"

She slings me the bag, and is quite obviously done with me.  Bear in mind that I hadn't been rude, and my only \"crime\" was to come in to see where my food was after a now 25 minute wait.  \"I still need my drink, please\", I said.  She looked at me like somehow my words had formed themselves into a sharp object and were repeatedly stabbing her in the head.  I got my cup, and was on my way.

To credit, the food was hot and obviously freshly cooked.

But this wait confounded me.  Did it really take 20 minutes to prepare a \"Double Down\" sandwich?  At this point, is it still really considered \"fast food\"?

Braving my stomach's well-being, I went to another KFC a few days later and tried another.  While they had me pull over to wait, this time, it took less than 3 minutes.

But let me tell you: After sampling a second one of these sandwiches, I think I'm cured of my need to ever sample another one of these monstrosities again.  I think my very soul is tainted, and I may need to go to confession.  Or have an exorcism performed.

As for this original address, I've been here a few times in the past, and was never impressed by the lackluster service.  This last incredibly pained to do her job server was the final straw in me ever coming to this particular KFC again.

(Note I said \"this one\", as oh, how I do love their mashed potatoes.)"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. There was 8 popcorn chicken signs around the whole restaurant. Went through the drive thru and they told me that the popcorn chicken had been recalled for quality issues. Aka they didn't want to make them. They said that it was recalled because customers complained of the size. Load of bull. We called corporate and there was no recall and have no idea why we would have been told that."}
{"text":"No applesauce given with the kids meals. \"We don't do that anymore.\" But it's on the menu as part of the meal. Isn't this deceptive advertising? No substitution offered (even when asked for). No apology given (didn't even occur to them). And they still charge the full $4.99 for a kids meal missing one of its five items. Also, no Capri Sun as advertised; instead, just a soft drink.

Expect to go back to the counter to beg for butter, honey and dipping sauces, since none are offered or included. You'll have to wait, though, while other customers debate the accuracy of their orders and their billings. The one and a half star average Yelp rating for this establishment is clearly not just the result of one or two disgruntled reviewers. I saw no happy diners on this visit.

I suggest you visit another KFC that has more honest management and more considerate employees. My expectations for fast food are always pretty modest, but I would never expect to feel as though I had been rudely conned and cheated. I did at this KFC."}
{"text":"Dry, overcooked unrecognizable pieces of cold greasy pigeon with more batter than meat. Just drive by, don't slow down, don't look over don't even think about it."}
{"text":"Rude service. Went through the drive thru, guy asked me to repeat the order about 15 times and acted annoyed, despite the fact that I'm speaking clear English. I will never understand why they'd have the staff member who barely speaks English taking orders. Ordered the $5 fill up and last time I got home and they had forgotten the coleslaw. So this time I open the boxes to make sure it's there before I pull away and sure enough one is missing. I inform the guy I'm missing a coleslaw and he starts arguing with me, saying \"in the bag! In the bag!\" I say no, it's not, and he is yelling that it is, and rolling his eyes and clucking his tongue like I'm some stupid female who doesn't understand what \"in the bag\" means. So I proceed to take every item out of the bag, proving it is NOT, in fact, in the freaking bag and I guess he sees it to his left, says \"oh\" and shoves it at me. No apology after yelling at me or anything. He acted like it was some grand scheme of mine to rip them off of some coleslaw. I'd like to think this guy is equally rude to everyone but I think he has a particular problem with women and the fact that we drive here or something. I won't go here anymore cause this guy always seems to be working the drive thru. If I want to spend money on food while getting yelled at by a male I'll just go to lunch with my dad."}
{"text":"Waited 40 minutes for chicken. Employees were rude about it. Once I got the chicken home I found that they had put it in the box still covered in grease to the point that the skin fell off when I pull the chicken out of the box it was disgusting. I'll never go back and frankly don't know if I'll have KFC anymore. Sure would like to find a good fried chicken place here in South East Gilbert."}
{"text":"Very incompetent staff. They mistook when I said I didn't want chicken thighs in my 12 piece for I don't want sides which is understandable but I corrected at the window and said I want my sides with the bucket but we don't eat chicken thighs. No thighs.  And she said okay and then still have my thighs just didn't care to fix my order."}
{"text":"I don't usually do reviews but I think the lack of quality here rates my time. My husband and I ordered two combo meals to go, his potato wedges were rock hard and cold and they didn't even include the chocolate chip cookie. My meal came with cole slaw and a dried out biscuit. 
When I tried to call and discuss this issue someone picked up the phone and just hung it up.  I tried again and this time they just let it ring.  Not very customer service oriented. 
I will try calling management tomorrow."}
{"text":"Who runs out of all extra crispy chicken at dinner time? 
The only saving grace that gave this place  2 stars instead of 1 was the nice, apologetic drive-thru staff member."}
{"text":"Not sure how KFC runs out of chicken, but this one succeeded.    They were out of tenders which means that affects other menu items.   I have been there previously and they were out of gravy.   Obviously the ordering of supervision is horrible....."}
{"text":"I was apprehensive to begin with, but it's a newer looking restaurant so I gave it a try. I guess it was a bad idea. The food was old and lacked taste. Old chicken becomes very chewy and I just gave up without finishing my meal. I wish I could say the few bites I did have were worth the calories, but it was not the case."}
{"text":"This KFC (store #D212096) 5930 Centennial Center Blvd. is absolutely horrible, no more visits for me. First thing my order was wrong. I ordered an 8 pcs all dark and received 8 pcs mixed. Being in the drive thru line I did not check my order for correctness and freshness, and that's my bad. What really pisses me off was the quality of the chicken. I ordered extra crispy which it was maybe crispy at 10 o'clock this morning (my order was placed 5pm). There is a difference in being crispy and moist and being hard and dry because of time laying under the warming lights. The chicken was basically inedible  We removed all skin from the chicken and collected about a half bucket of hard dry skin. Underneath all of the hard dry skin was hard dry chicken. The wings were a total loss. No way could they be eaten. I was going to take this mess back to KFC. My wife convinced me writing a review on Yelp and other social media was better than pitching a fit and no more of our business for at least this location. rated 1 because I could not rate 0"}
{"text":"Love this location. Love their Nashville tenders platter .. Chicken is very fresh and perfectly cooked. I can't believe I actually drive 11 miles to this place thru all that crazy road construction. But it's worth it ..  the manager and service is great and consistent."}
{"text":"KFC is known for their chicken, not their customer service. This point is well punctuated at this location.

They are directly across the street from Concord Mills Mall, and I guess too busy to be bothered with pesky things like customer satisfaction, and getting an order correct.

They are also not very polite here. I went there yesterday and asked for dark meat, and a younger sounding man hollered in response, \"we don't have no dark meat!\"  
I asked \"not in grilled, or Crispy?\"
He yelled  \"yeah, those but not Original!\"

I always check the box before I drive away, because it is often they get the order incorrect.   It is also fairly common to see the lines six cars deep...  

Which is coincidentally why I am giving them three stars, rather than two.  It's because they are stretched thin.  The staff is probably overworked, and doing the best they can.

I would call this a management issue.  They should give customers an incentive to order and pay online and park in a slot to alleviate congestion and attitude at the drive through."}
{"text":"One of the best locations of KFC around.  The food is hot, fresh and they typically honor your request for a specific chicken part, and they always get my order right.

Additionally, I appreciate both their $20 family deal.  It's got 8 pieces of chicken, four biscuits and two sides.  Yes it's fast food, but it doesn't seem like you're feeding your loved ones slop."}
{"text":"Poor service. Food is good when they have it a available which is rare. They have grilled chicken on the menu but it's never available. Been as early as 7 and they tell me they have none and won't even give me the option to wait for them to make it. They say the grill is off. This has happened to me on more than occasions."}
{"text":"I wanted to try the new \"Nashville Hot Chicken\", so I decided to hit up the drive thru.  Ordered the 3 piece hot chicken meal and subbed out mashed potatoes for the coleslaw.  I also ordered a \"Go Cup\" with popcorn chicken.  Total was about $9.00.  Here is how it was.............

Nashville Hot Chicken Combo-  They give you 3 strips, a small mashed potatoes, and a biscuit.  The strips were pretty big, and coated extremely well with their seasoning.  The seasoning has a wet texture to it and had the heat of cayenne pepper.  They were decent.  Not crave worthy, but not bad either.  I'm glad I tried them out!  The potatoes were kind of nasty.  I much prefer Popeyes/Churchs potatoes over KFCs.  They tasted too pasty, and I let them sit for a minute while I ate all my other food, and when I came back to them, they tasted worse!  I threw most of them away.  The biscuit was alright.  Not as good as I had remembered past KFC biscuits being, but it served its purpose.  2 Star entree.

Go Cup-  I got this with popcorn chicken.  It was only $2.99 and was a great deal.  It came with maybe 10 pieces of popcorn chicken, as well as a pretty big mound of fries.  The chicken was tasty and had a good texture and flavor.  The fries were crispy and hot and pretty damn tasty.  I liked this item a lot better than the Nashville Hot Chicken.  4 star entree.

Service at the drive thru was friendly and I got my food pretty quick.  Overall, an average experience.  It filled me up, but it wasn't amazing.  Exactly as Yelp says, A-OK."}
{"text":"Not sure when it happened, but within the last year or so, KFC has improved, GREATLY!  Their chicken strips used to be small and dry, and I never craved them.  That has changed, recently.  I have been to KFC 3 or 4 times in the past month.

I stopped by this location for lunch the other day.  I had only been to this one once before, and that experience wasn't so great.  Food was meh, and the girl working the drive through had the WORST RBF (Resting Bitch Face) I have EVER seen.  You could tell that she hated her job.  Anyways...........  fast forward to this weekend.  I drove through and ordered the 3 strip combo and decided to go with the Nashville Hot version.  $4.99 and you get 3 strips, a mashed potatoes and a biscuit.  Here is how it was.......................

3 Strip Combo-  Was wanting a little heat today, so I went with the Nashville Hot.  They use a somewhat spicy oil based sauce to coat these strips with.  The strips were nice and crispy/crunchy and are way bigger than before (refer to my first line...I always remembered KFC having small, dried out strips that were always inconsistent).  The Nashville Hot is a tasty flavor.  Just enough heat/spice  without burning the inside of your mouth.  Of the 3 signature flavors, I like the Nashville Hot and the Georgia Gold the best (tied, in preference...they are both great!) and the Smokehouse BBQ is meh.  This meal also comes with a decent sized mashed potatoes, and a biscuit.  The potatoes and gravy are delicious, but the biscuits are a little disappointing (other chicken places like Popeyes and Churchs have way better biscuits).  I ate everything and was on my way.

For $4.99, this is a very good deal.  The chicken strips are fantastic and it's a perfect amount of food to fill you up, but not leave you stuffed.  3 stars only because of the service still lacking a bit.  I paid with my card, they took my card, closed the little window and then I sat there for a good 4 to 5 minutes.  They handed me my bag of food and card and did apologize to something of the account of \"Sorry, our credit card machine takes forever.\"  Still....5 minutes to run a card?  Damn, Gina!  Time for a new computer system or something.  5 minutes is a really long time to wait in a drive thru (with no other cars, just myself) for your food.  Definitely been to friendlier, faster KFC's, but this is the closest one to my house, so I'm sure I will return in due time."}
{"text":"If I'm eating chicken, it is usually from Popeye's, Church's or Bush's.  I hadn't had KFC in quite some time though, so I decided to stop by the other week to get some grub.  I went with their $5.00 fill up (It was $5.50 at this location though...they had stickers over the menu board stating $5.50.  A little odd, but whatever.) meal with the chicken strips. This box came with 3 chicken tenders, a medium sized potatoes (bigger than a small, single serving, but not quite as large as a \"family size\"), a biscuit, a drink and a chocolate chip cookie.   Here is how it was................

Chicken Strip Fill Up Box-  First thing I noticed was how large the chicken strips were.  On past KFC adventures, the chicken strips were always small and skimp (always tasted alright, but were always small).  These things were massive compared to past ones.  Moist and not dried out, and the batter has that noticeable \"secret herbs and spices\" taste.  I much prefer the strips at the other 3 chicken places I mentioned, but these were still good.  The mashed potatoes were great!  Nice rich gravy and the serving size was large for the combo.  The biscuit was just meh.  I think KFC biscuits have gone downhill in quality.  They say \"buttermilk biscuit\", but there is hardly any butter or tang flavor that is synonymous with buttermilk!  Drink was a drink.  Pepsi.  The chocolate chip cookie to end the meal wasn't bad.  Decent for a fast food joint.

Overall, it was an alright meal.  The amount of food for about $6.00 was well worth it.  Chicken strips were tasty, potatoes were great and I enjoyed my lunch.  Not sure if I am rushing to come back here, but if a KFC craving hits, this place is close to work and I'm sure I'll be back at some point."}
{"text":"Not all KFC's are created equal.

Over the past few months, I have rediscovered KFC, and genuinely enjoyed it.  Decided I would get lunch here today, and came down to this particular one (I usually go to the one on 19th and Union Hills).  I went with the $5 fill up box with 3 tenders, mashed potatoes, biscuit, drink and a cookie.  Just a tad over $6.00 and well worth it for the amount of food you get.  Went through the drive thru and then parked and grubbed down.  Here is how it was...............

Chicken Strips-  Eh.....not nearly as good as the other KFC's I have recently been to.  These strips were smaller, not coated as well, a little drier, and honestly, a bit skimp.  They were piping hot (too hot to eat right away), so I could tell they were cooked fresh, but they reminded me of the \"old KFC\" and that is not a good thing.  The breading was really light and not too crispy.  The chicken had a funky texure to it too.  Night and day from what I expected,  and what I was craving.

Biscuit-  This biscuit was actually better than other KFC's I had been to.  It was softer, and more buttery.  Probably the best KFC biscuit I have ever had.  Wish I had gotten a few more of them!

Mashed Potatoes-  Same as usual.  A huge serving completely smothered in gravy.  Tasty! 

Cookie-  Good chocolate chip cookie.  A nice bonus item added to the \"box\".  Still warm and it had a ton of chocolate chips in it.

Guy at the drive thru was nice and I got my food pretty quick.  Too bad the chicken strips were whack!  Everything else was fine (actually really good) so maybe the chicken was just a one off?  Doubt I will be back to this one since I know my other KFC serves it up the way I like it."}
{"text":"I HATE YOU ! YOU RUINED MY LIFE !   Well , i was that angry that the second time i went to this location for pot pie, they were out (second time they said machine died) so got the breast meal.. got it home and received the 2  meals both breasts were definitely sitting around for a few hours..just vile..$11 wasted on crap.

my advise LOOK ELSEWHERE"}
{"text":"If I could give less stars I would. A couple of months back I ordered a family meal with some hot wings on the side, got home made everyone their plates bit into the hot wings (that were for me) and a mouth full of blood not just pink all pieces were bloody= Undercooked chicken.. I called and expressed my dissatisfaction and They decided they would replace my order on a future order and even though I was pissed it was the least they could do. I know stuff happens so I decided to continue to give this place my business.... a couple of weeks ago I decided to go back and purchase a family meal and added hot wings that I requested were well done and was advised to pull to the front and wait for my order. I told the lady Darcy please don't forget anything because whenever I go there it never fails and sure enough we get home with only chicken and no sides! I was livid because I didn't spend 30+ dollars to go home to 1/2 an order and I am trying to feed my children and family so needless to say the meal was ruined and I refused to go back to KFC to pick up what they forgot so I called them again to express my concerns and they advised me they noted my name and would comp the meal again which I feel is only right. I don't know about anyone else but I have a family of 6 and am not interested in throwing my money away. 
I decided tonight hey they owe me a meal so ill go pick it up. Get there, guy takes my order, I explain what happened and he explains to the manager and she says who said they'd comp you. I advised it was Darcy and the manager and she says where's the receipt I advised it was weeks ago and that I didn't have it but the manager said she placed my name in some book. The manager asks me my name and go to the side to tell me nope your name is not here. Darcy comes over and tells me I'm a liar (I don't have anything nice to say about her so I'll keep my comments to myself. But I will say people who work with the public should be required to take drug tests ?) needless to say their customer service is garbage she offered to give me my sides but that was it. I also had my children with me and they saw how horrible that manager and Darcy was that night. I asked for their corporate number and she told me it's not corporate it's a franchise and gave me someone named Gabriels number. Probably the wrong number but just want everyone to know if you're ok with poor quality food and service this is your place  but if you like good chicken with great customer service just go around the corner to Rasing Cane's!! #KfcIsGarbage"}
{"text":"I want there on a Wednesday about 8:30 p.m. It wasn't too busy but there was a little bit of a wait on chicken tenders (8 min). Which was fine because, I would much rather have my food hot and fresh then cold any day.!!  Jonathan was my cashier and I believe he also took my order. He was very sweet and friendly. and apologized for the wait. When he brought the food  to car, he apologized again. No biggie man! Thanks for making sure my food was up to par! I'm always down for good customer service. And Jonathan had it!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location. Actually, I haven't been to a KFC in a while. This one I was a little skeptical about being it's not far from a not so desirable location. However, don't judge a book by its cover is a true statement when it comes to this location. The inside of the restaurant was one of the cleanest KFC's I have been inside! The staff was super friendly and the food was fresh. I can't remember the cashier name but my receipt says \"Sandra\". But again all of the team members were pleasant and nice. Also the exterior of the restaurant was not in bad shape and it appears as if they are building a Taco Bell right next door. Great first impression.  Keep up the good work team KFC!"}
{"text":"The staff seem to be average however the Manager did come by and ask was everything okay. I choice to eat in and me and my daughter was the only one in the building. The outside could use some work as far as upkeep and cleanness. The inside was okay I guess average at best the food was good or what you would expect at a fast food place."}
{"text":"Chicken is overpriced other than Sundays when you get $10 buckets. Twice now my car has been hit in the parking lot and the other driver just took off. Can they make the lot any smaller?"}
{"text":"After a busy morning, what with work, a sporty little run along the canal (good news...no floating bodies and no one jumping out of the bushes, trying to decapitate me this morning...yay!) and all the other attendant details of my life, I needed to get retoxed for a busy afternoon!

And today, with time being in short supply, I turned to my background in mathematics and science and revised the question of \"how should I retox?\" to \"what is the most toxic thing I can eat for lunch and survive?\"

The answer, my friends, is the Double Down from KFC!

Like all of you, I am a sucker for a well executed television commercial...and KFC's ad for this one has it all...large, beefy men eating a Double Down and admiring the \"no bun/all meat\" approach to sandwiching...nubile young women looking at them consuming said Double Down in a demur, yet admiring fashion...the subliminal messages that flash for a millisecond or so and implant the KFC craving so deep in our brains that it resides right next to religion and sexual preference in the subcortex...a completely \"hindbrain\" event...off I went!

The Double Down appeals to the 400 pounder living in all of us...double \"bacon\", wrapped in double \"cheese\", surrounded by double \"chicken\" (I use quotes around those words because I'm pretty sure that no actual pigs or chickens were harmed in order for me to have lunch...and the \"cheese\" was, well, let's just call it \"petroleum based cheese-like food product\").

http://tinyurl.com/67lxpl

The smiling men of the KFC lunch shift greeted me as I walked in and I had my Double Down and Diet Coke (HAHAHAHA...I know...Diet Coke) about 12 seconds after I paid for it.

It was as advertised...2 pieces of chicken (with no pesky bones to slow down your munching and gnashing), the bacon and cheese and some sort pinkish mayo in a wax paper wrapper.

The chicken part of the sandwich could have used either another minute or 2 in the fryer or a minute or 2 less in the warming trays...the breading was either under cooked or over greased (the fact that it was difficult to determine tells you pretty much everything you need to know about the quality of the \"sandwich\").

It just wasn't very good...and I didn't see any attractive young ladies gazing at me admiringly as I hoovered down this little gullet greaser.

540 calories (not that I watch that), 32 grams of fat (or lube, as I like to think of it), 1380 milligrams of sodium (I've seen salt licks back on the the cattle ranch with less than that) and 11 grams of dietary fiber (more lube).

The science behind this \"sandwich\" says I should typing this from the great beyond right now...but the sweet balance of my life...the detox/retox...the yin and the yang, all combine to keep me safe and reasonably healthy!

But don't try this at home...I am a trained professional!"}

When I told them they had no customer service skills the one girl tried to come around the counter at me all the while the manager was standing there."}
{"text":"The first person to answer the drive thru was not friendly. It seemed like I was inconveniencing them with placing an order. I had asked for tenders and informed they were out. The first person was having  having difficulty taking my order as they had \"several things going on\". I heard them ask for someone else to take my order as their headset was still on. The young lady that took over was more than accommodating and very friendly. I had to repeat my order 3 times and it was still incorrect. After paying I was asked to pull around to the front. While I was there waiting, they were locking the doors (website says the store is open until 10 and Yelp says 11, but there are no visible hours on the doors or drive thru). The young lady that took my order had forgotten to charge me for one of my sandwiches and asked me to go back through the drive thru. My order was ready shortly after I had paid for the item they missed. They had given me extra cookies for the inconvenience, which was a nice gesture. After arriving at home with my food I noticed that my drinks were 3/4 full. Food was luke warm at best (other than mashed potatoes)."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE Kentucky Fried Chicken when I was a kid in Ohio. I haven't had it since moving to Vegas, and thought I'd have some for nostalgia's sake. I knew it isn't healthy- it's salty and greasy- but I was prepared. 

But I wasn't prepared. This chicken was so salty that parts of it were barely palatable. I had someone else taste it and they said it was saltier than they remember. 

Another problem was the biscuits. They were totally smashed and misshapen, which was strange because they were just sitting in the box on top of the chicken. They must've been squished before they gave them to me. Why would you purposely give a customer an inferior product?

I don't know if it's just this particular location but I may never get KFC again. They ruined my good memories."}
{"text":"OK, I admit I still had a craving for KFC ever since my last unfavorable KFC review 3 weeks ago.  I decided to give them another chance to redeem themselves.  I called the store first just to make sure everything I wanted was available without having to wait 30 minutes.  Call made and was assured everything was available so I jumped in the car and was there in less than 10 minutes.

I walked in and placed my order... Lo and behold, everything I ordered was available and in my order just exactly how I wanted it.  The pieces were good sized and all freshly made.  Katie, our server was very helpful and provided exceptional service.  She even let us know that for an additional 28 cents we could get a drink and desert cookie!  Absolutely, 28 cents is minimal, I would pay 20 times that just for quality, and intelligent service at the counter.  She turned around my previous bad experience at KFC, thanks!!

The food tasted just how I remembered it, hot, tasty, and finger lickin good, just like they advertise on TV.  Parking was easy, the store was the cleanest I have ever seen it, and my order was ready within minutes of placing it.  Thanks, my craving was satisfied and a bad experience was replaced by a good one."}
{"text":"Chicken is raw and the crispy part is always falling off and it is very very greasy.every time I go through the drive thru I have to park and wait"}
{"text":"Every time my family and I come here to get food and take it home, they have to get something wrong. I had orders a large side of mac. I looked and it was a small side. No big deal, I'll just go in and get the right one. When I got inside, the \"manager\" told me I needed my receipt in order to get my order CORRECTED. Really? Over a side of mac? ( that you messed up on ) So I went out, got my receipt, and went back in just to find out the manager had looked up my receipt on the computer and after finding out he was in the wrong, went and sat in the office and refused to speak with me again. Bottom line, no accuracy, no customer service, no ownership for mistakes. I will NEVER return."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst drive thru place I've been to in my life.
I went there 6 times and they never got my order right.
They were always rude to me as well.
The final straw was when i went to the drive thru and no one responded for 10 min.  
I said hello to make sure the machine wasnt broken.  The lady goes WAIT(in a super rude way).
I just left...  
all the other drive thrus always responded  to me at least.
Half of the time there were no cars infront of me.
I really like chicken but now I dont.
Never going there again..."}
{"text":"NO STaRS!!!! We here last week to get the new 20$ combo, and was informed that i was not allowed to substitute my sides. Who wants to eat 2 sides of mash and coleslaw only? Not me and my family!! I was very upset, disappointed and disgusted. My son has an allergy and they didny even ask me. I asked how much the upcharge was and they said there is not one. That i had to just take what they give and buy anything additional. Never coming back to KFC!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The customer service in this place is absolutely horrible. The manager is rude to the customers and refuses to fix the issues when they accure. She was yelling at me thru the drive thru and then made me come into the dinning room when asked to correct my order. And then proceeded to yell at me in front of in house guest in the donner room. All the employees were great and it said that they have to be under this type of management."}
{"text":"No pepper no crispy chicken no Pepsi what a joke this location is I figured I'd try again all the things they didn't have was just what I heard standing in line than when I ordered chicken tender meal was told 20mins! Think it might have been the kids first day at the register and couldn't hear a word he was saying"}
{"text":"It's KFC. If you need to read a review, you haven't lived in this country very long :-P"}
{"text":"My sandwich was cold  and when asking the cashier for advice of how big the sandwich was she said \"I don't know \" then proceeded to charge me. It would have been nice to maybe guesstimate or ask someone in the back? Customer service isn't all that great."}
{"text":"I had a really good experience here last week with my kids.  We got a couple of five dollar fill up boxes.  My daughter loved the mac n cheese."}
{"text":"KFC is my all time favorite food, but this location is the worse KFC I've been to. I came here a few days ago, waited in the drive thru and was told they closed early since they ran out of chicken. It's KFC! All they sell are chicken. It was also 3 hrs before they were suppose to close. Today, I made the mistake of coming back. I waited in line in my car a total of 20 mins. I tried ordering and everything I wanted they seemed to be out of, even original style. I finally settled on what they had left and managed to communicate and re-communicate what I wanted. Once I got to the window, I was told that there's a 15 min wait on biscuits. I immediately said, \"No thanks, I'm good.\" They did give me an extra side for that inconvenience. I finally got my food and they handed me my drink with no ice. I asked for ice and I was informed they didn't have that too. I am completely dissatisfied with my experience the last few days. It's definitely worth driving to a different KFC."}
{"text":"The worst KFC i have ever been too, waiting over 30 mins  in the drive thru  the Manager being rude and unprofessional and short with the customers ,  its pretty sad that a employee comes out, and is more professional explaining why is this happen than the Manager.    I commute back and forth from Phoenix, I will NEVER get off the expressway to go to that KFC there again !!!"}
{"text":"One star only because you can't give zero. Walked in to the place and it stunk like old oil, the floor was sticky and the staff ignored me. Never again."}
{"text":"Food is always good, but then I always get chicken and specifically ask for it \"fresh out of the fryer\",  so I know that it's hot!   Nothing worse than luke warm fried food! 

Staff and managers are always fantastic and go out of their way to be nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Since I was a little kid I've always liked their come slaw, I still do.  That is one of the main reasons for coming here.  My family was in the mood for KFC so exercised to try this new location.  I went inside to order a carry out order.  Their menu board says that you get a free cake (chocolate chip or red velvet cake) with a 10 pc meal or larger.  I ordered the 16 pc meal for $36.99 and waited to get my order.  

After getting my order I headed outside and looked at my bag while walking.  I didn't see the cake included in either of the bags I received so I went back and asked where the cake was.  The guy that took my order said that you specifically have to ask for the cake otherwise you don't get it.  I said that it shows on the menu that it comes with it.  I asked shouldn't it be included automatically and can't you just give me the cake?  He said no.  I said that that's not right but eventually he gave me a chocolaty chip cake.

He says that the manager will yell at him for giving out the cake without ringing it up (I don't know if he did this after I left to correct it).  Then he said something about food costs which I really didn't pay attention to.  Actually, I don't really care what their food costs are.  But if you're going to start talking about stuff like that, bring out the invoices for how much the food costs if you even have access to it or keep your mouth shut.

Sadly I believe him about his manager yelling at him."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service. The girl taking our order kept ignoring what we asked for, and would walk away while we were talking. Then we were supposed to get a free lemonade, and the guy refused to give it to us even though we ordered a 16 piece meal and the lemonade comes with a 10 piece or larger. Never going back."}
{"text":"This kfc is the best cleanest kfc around and there general manager Michele is absolutely lovely!"}
{"text":"Very hit and miss experience.  It's sad when you crave that salty greasy addictive fix - and you only get satisfied about half the time.

It used to be better.  Once upon a time KFC had something called Hot and Spicy chicken - and didn't they also have Extra Crispy?  And I swear, the Hot and Spicy seemed to almost always be larger, plumper pieces of chicken - almost as if it came from a better selection of their \"best\" chickens.

And I kept going back and forth between KFC with their Hot and Spicy, and Popeye's (Popeye's is generally a superior product).  And for quite a while I found the KFC (only the Hot and Spicy) to be better than Popeye's.  (When Popeye's was not changing their grease often enough).

Well, stupid KFC killed off the Hot and Spicy - and you can't get the extra crispy anymore - can you?

So I kept switching back to Popeye's often after being disappointed with KFC - and that was between 40 and 60% of the time.

I truly find myself unhappy with my KFC order about 50% of the time - and I was a little shocked to discover a warning on my receipt one day (intended for KFC staff to read) to watch out for complaints from this customer !  Piss me off.  (I guess they didn't expect the customer (me) to notice this note.)

So, anyways, I ordered today - and AGAIN the call center couldn't even get a simple order correct - and I received the chicken ONE HOUR AND 7 MINUTES after I ordered it - and even worse, when I called KFC back to speak to one of their \"customer service\" people, they just passed me along to the store - when it was the call center that screwed up the order.

I'm done with these idiots.  50% satisfaction is not good enough."}
{"text":"Can you believe that they recently JACKED their delivery charge to FIVE BUCKS ! - so when you add tax on delivery, and a tip, you are adding ten bucks to an often AWFUL MEAL."}
{"text":"THEY NOW CHARGE FIVE DOLLARS - $5 FOR DELIVERY !

I'm sorry - in case you can't believe it - you are now being GOUGED five bucks (plus almost a dollar in tax) to get delivery of this poisonous food.

So about 6 bucks in delivery, and what, about a 4 buck tip - that adds TEN DOLLARS to an already expensive meal.

I'm going to go throw up now ..."}
{"text":"I've often been unhappy after eating KFC, but the pleasant surprise this time was they had Extra Crispy chicken on my most recent trip (during Toonie Tuesdays) - and it's quite nice.  (I'd given up asking for Extra Crispy - because I thought they'd eliminated it a year or two ago.

The staff at the Eaton Center KFC was pleasant and helpful and offered me a choice of salad when I said I didn't want fries in my Tuesday special.

I recommend trying the Extra Crispy.  You may enjoy it."}
{"text":"It's nice because it's close to the turnpike and the main road going into Pittsburgh. The place was really clean and the staff was nice I got the 2 pieces friend the breast was moist and not dry which is better than most places. The biscuit was really good I'm always surprised how good there mashed potatoes taste."}
{"text":"Grandma C wanted to bring KFC over for our Sunday dinner. I drove her down here and we went inside to order the food because she wanted to take her time with the menu. There were a couple of teens hanging out in front of the counter talking with a couple employees behind the counter. There was no greeting when we walked in but one of the employees moved over and stood behind one of the registers. She just stared at us.
After Grandma C and I figured out what we wanted we placed our order. The girl at the register was pleasant enough I guess. We waited about 4 minutes and the order was ready. I checked what I could without taking everything out of the bag and the order seemed correct. Which I eventually found out it was. 
We ordered the chicken extra crispy. The chicken was fine but it's interesting that the skin slides off so in my limited experience, I was eating the meat and then the skin. The sides we got were mashed potatoes and gravy, coleslaw, corn kernels and biscuits. The mashed and gravy was ok, nothing special. The coleslaw was actually decent, not too watery and fairly flavorful. I didn't have a biscuit so no comment there. All in all it really wasn't that bad.
Average service, average fried chicken, average sides. 3 Stars."}
{"text":"Five stars for a job well done customer service is great and the employees worked hard to make great KFC Chicken. 
Thank you Surprise KFC"}
{"text":"This location is pretty terrible. I've been there several times and each time I'm reminded why we don't go often. In the drive thru, they mess up our order about 90% of the time. Inside, the music is oddly loud...hard to hear the staff or anyone else. The food is fine. It's really the staff that makes it unpleasant. Not great at their jobs and generally not friendly."}
{"text":"Went here to give Kfc another try since it's been awhile. I go through drive thru at 9:30 pm 1 hour before closing and the girl tells me they have no chicken only grilled breast meat. Wtf, how do you run out of cooked chicken at KFC?"}
{"text":"I just are here and everything was fine. I had a two piece Classic Meal, all white, Extra Crispy with mashed potatoes and cole slaw. The drive thru service was quick and polite."}
{"text":"After recording my order, I immediately remembered why I haven't eaten at a KFC in literally 10+ years. Look at my photos. They take absolutely no pride in serving something that resembles the giant posters in their windows. 

-The chicken sandwich was extremely bland, and not only didn't look anything like the poster on the window, it only filled 2/3 of the bun(see my photo).

-Even the pickles had no flavor. How the hell does a pickle not taste like a pickle?! 

-The potato wedges were as good as the wedges avail in the hot food area of grocery stores.

-The chocolate chip cookie was ok.

-The Diet Pepsi tasted like they ran out of soda water and I was drinking straight syrup.. *Shout-out to Taco Bell for always having the best Diet Pepsi.* Not kidding


Really can't review the employees other than the girl at the window was nice, but not happy to be working..and the dude smoking by the drive thru order area, looked like he was pissed off that another customer showed up. He just glared at me like my mom did when I brought home a D in high school."}
{"text":"10 minute drive thru line time. Wonderful. The food was good; the service is horrible."}
{"text":"This ridiculous location does not let you do substitutions. I don't like their mashed potatoes and don't want them, yet I'm stuck with them at this location. Crazy...."}
{"text":"Decided to try KFC again after years for those $5 meal deals. The chicken was slimy and grease, the biscuit was dry and semi-hard, the mashed potatoes and gravy were almost stone cold, and the cookie was extremely small, but good. Not worth the money because now I'm sick out of my mind and it's safe to say the chicken was to blame. I think this location needs to clean up, cook their food right, and not hold chicken for the whole day."}
{"text":"This may be the worst KFC ever.
1) i made my order, they bring it out to my car missing Mac and cheese and popcorn chicken.  
2) I head inside to inquire, they take several minutes to bring it out, all the while the manager just looks at me helplessly.
3) The mac and cheese they brought was only half full but I didn't notice until I got home. It was also very pale yellow and had a strange taste so we threw it out.
4) the chicken was also poorly flavored. I could barely tell which was the extra crispy and which was original recipe.

This is the second time there have been problems with my order here and I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Need to update menus for this store.  Menu says they have corn on the cob. Nope.  Also, when giving the order total either include the tax or don't quote the price until we drive up to the window."}
{"text":"Customer service is really lacking in this KFC. They messed up my order and when I called to complain the manager told me  to bring back the old food even if I couldn't come back until tomorrow. Really bring back the old food, I have never heard of such a thing. What happened to the customer is always right!!! won't be going back there!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place is still in business. I don't eat this food, but my family likes to sometimes. The few times we've driven over and gone through the drive through to bring chicken home the wait is so long. It's always dead, like a ghost town. They never seem to have anything ready for purchase, which is understandable if they get so few customers coming through, they fry it fresh to order I guess, but still... I don't understand. Maybe they get most of their business during the lunch hour? I don't recommend going around the dinner hour for sure."}
{"text":"It's okay. The service is decent. The prices are a little high...  They are like any other KFC in terms of quality of service and the prices of the food. There is seating arrangements so you can sit down to eat too. The location is a nice location."}
{"text":"I do not understand why yelp will not allow you to put no stars!!

We got food tonight and we are sick !!! So I wanted to call and let them know and there is NO WAY TO CALL this store ! So I called the rainbow and told her we are all sick and she said \" ya um the only way to get ahold of them is going in\""}
{"text":"Food was cold, biscuits were hard as a rock and part of our order was missing. Went back to store and was told they will not cool anymore food for the night and offered extra side but they were all cold. We did not get dipping sauce with one of meals. We spent 70.00 at this location and it definitely wasn't worth it. It was a huge disappointment for the amount of money I spent for 2 family meals."}
{"text":"I don't come here often.  It is the closest to my house at a 15 minute drive.  It is clean, neat and customer service is great. I've never had a problem here and the food is excellent, considering it is fast food."}
{"text":"This KFC sucks a big one!  They charged $.50 extra to get two sides of potatoes in a meal.  The only KFC that has ever done that.    Also super slow drive thru.  Also super dumb that they charge an additional $.39 to use a card to pay.  Lame.

And to top it all off...I just got home and they screwed up my order.  Never going here again."}
{"text":"It is what it is for fast food. Four stars for the chicken pot pie which is the only thing i eat here. Can't be too critical with fast food. Lol."}
{"text":"Typical taco bell/KFC. Doesn't participate in dbacks taco promo."}
{"text":"This KFC is close to home and one of few choices in the 'close' area pretty much one of the only reasons we do visit and hope for improved experience every time we do. Today order was taken promptly and so were payment and drinks provided. I was asked to pull around front as the 'zingers will be right up'... i don't mind waiting for fresh food for a few minutes and the young man taking my order and waiting on me was very friendly and polite.  I pulled around front to park as flashbacks of multiple visits where I was told they had to check if they had the breast meat I was ordering!!  I pulled in my spot and waited about 5 min before my food was delivered, told him thank you and headed home get home to two zinger meals where it wasn't obvious anything was really fresh; hot chicken should have had good melted cheese while one was the other was still pretty cold along with the cheese came bacon one 1/2 piece of bacon...what a waste you can't taste that!the bottom bun on both sandwiches were so dry/stale that they split after taking a bite, not like well toasted more like been on the counter for a week.  I do want to say the customer service tonight was wonderful they thanked me for my wait and everything, I really just wish this place would get it's stuff together keep the pleasant staff and keep food quality high."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible drive through, not only did I order a meal , with lemonade...by the time I got home which is a few blocks away put the straw in and the lemonade is water , with ice then no silverware for my potatoes and my fries are cold, never never again, check your thins at the drive through"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. This store is constantly out of everything. They make you wait 30 min then they screw up the order. Desperately in need of a management change."}
{"text":"Yes, I am yelping KFC.

KFC gets a bad wrap. What's better than a good old fashioned bucket of original recipe chicken. Hit the spot for that hangover. Mmmmm good, grease dripping off the elbows!

BOTTOM LINE: I'm good for 10 more years"}
{"text":"I was advised there's a 30 minute wait for all chicken. How does this KFC stay in business when nothing is available on the menu???"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. They have gotten their last dollar from me. I had a coupon for 9 piece of MIXED chicken for $12.00. I got home and I had 5 legs and 4 thighs. Why don't you say legs and thighs instead of MIXED. I expected to at least get a wing or breast."}
{"text":"Long wait, rude staff, didn't get everything I paid for....that's what I get for going with fast food :(

Hahah fast food, what a joke.  20+ minutes for some tenders and fries...then I could hear the staff complaining when I went inside because I was sick of waiting outside! Again, my bad. Won't happen again."}
{"text":"This place is on my radar as they seem to be very generous with their cheese sauce. I've been to other Taco Bells and when I order a Nachos Belgrande.....what you get is \"essence of cheese sauce\"...barely enough so that your nachos have cheese on them. I've never been disappointed here.
My go-to fave at the moment is these box combos.....you get a drink, fries supreme (which I always change to nachos belgrande), usually 2 items (whatever the box promo is that month) and a churro.
It's a lot of food but I somehow manage to get through it.
I always get a side order of jalapenos (at $.075 for a small container...it's a bit of a rip off...but the price is in line with other taco bells) and thankfully, they've brought back their hot/spicy sauce (it used to be called FIRE sauce). It adds a nice bit of heat......but as they're catering to the masses, its not over the top hot.
Due to a dislike of sour cream, I order everything without it....and have never had an issue where they've gotten the order incorrect.
I find the staff here to be great and they've always been pleasant to me. The store is kept very clean.
It's not the best Tex-Mex fast food joint out there (Mucho Burrito, Burrito Boyz, Chipotle, etc) but it'll due in a pinch."}
{"text":"Holy hell.....this place is busy.
Stopped in on my way to a friends house and we decided to grab a bucket for dinner, rather than having to cook. Obviously everyone in line in front of me had the same idea, as everyone in line ordered buckets as well.
Anyways, the line moved fairly slowly and it became quite unorganized after ordering and waiting for food. By the time I received my order, there were at least six other people waiting for their orders.
On to the food. Ordered a family bucket of 12 pieces..it came with medium: gravy, 2 salads and medium fries. I ordered the macaroni and coleslaw as side salads.
Some people love their coleslaw, some don't. I'm in the latter group. Hate it, hate it, hate it. However, there was none left by the time we finished our dinner, so the other 3 ppl eating are in the category of loving it. 
Macaroni salad was basic, fries ok, gravy great. Chicken was KFC...so you know what you're getting.
Staff working cash were great.....did well considering the crowds. Staff who prepared the orders had zero personality. 
Total cost (with tax) $36. Not bad to serve 4 ppl and have chicken left over."}
{"text":"Just a quick update - this KFC shut down just a few weeks ago. 

There still might be someone in line tho..."}
{"text":"The cashier Neil was very friendly and helpful, and he had a nice booty!! Don't be afraid to mess with him, and steal his hat... He loves it!"}
{"text":"Service and out of crispy chicken at 6:00pm and grease. Will go to the othe chicken place."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the 5 dollar fill up two piece meal on Friday and we've been sick in the stomach this whole weekend. It sucks because this is not the first time we got food from here and normally it's as good as can be expected for fast food chicken. I hope no one else got sick as well, but if they did I just want them to know that they weren't the only one.  Sorry we won't be back. Just thinking about it is making me nauseous."}
{"text":"Why review a chain restaurant?  Only to point out any significant variations from the norm.

The only way this KFC deviates is that it's slower.  Consistently.  I've been here to buy a couple small dinners and been asked to wait - \"we're out of chicken\".  Yesterday we wanted 30 pcs of chicken for a picnic.  I can understand waiting a little while for 30 pcs, but we waited every bit of 30 minutes.  And they weren't insanely busy.  It's summer time; weather is good; people picnic during good weather; have more chicken ready."}
{"text":"This KFC suffers from the same types of service problems other locations do as well.  The workforce doesn't seem to have any leadership.  If there was a manager on duty, I couldn't tell who it was.  I called at 5:03pm on a Friday, because I had a family sized order and didn't want to be told it would be a 20 minute wait.  I placed my order and was told it would be ready in 20-25 minutes.  I arrived about 20 minutes later, and was told the chicken needed 12 more minutes.  I sat in the restaurant and waited.  No \"sorry\" - no free drink.  About 20 minutes go by, and they have only had perhaps 8 customers come through, so they are not especially busy considering it's a Friday evening.  I walk back to the counter.  Two customers in front of me.  Both order SMALL amounts of chicken, one ordered 6 pieces of original, the other 4 pieces.  Both customers were told there's a 20 minute wait.  Again, it's Friday evening and not that much foot traffic, why isn't chicken being made ahead of the orders?  I get to the register and pay.  It's now 5:53pm and I receive my food.  It took 50 minutes total for 9 pieces of chicken and side dishes.  No apology.  I did come home and find 10 pieces of chicken in the bucket instead of 9, but honestly with how disorganized the crew was, I am not sure if that was done intentionally or just a mistake.  Again, I'm sure the workers are OK, but I didn't see anyone taking the reins and running the operation."}
{"text":"Not only was the service slow, the food was old, stale and dry. After taking it back to the counter, the manager informed me that she had no more grilled chicken and offered a couple of other things. They forgot the sides for 2 out of 4 meals also. The popcorn chicken was made up off all batter with very little, if any chicken. As we were eating, we heard another customer go to the counter stating that she had found a big piece of plastic in her food. The manager told her that she would replace it and when we were leaving about 20 minutes later, she was still waiting!  2  of the 4 employees were outside smoking in plain sight of everyone!! Terrible service and food!"}
{"text":"This is by far the most poorly managed and employed location of fast food I've ever had the displeasure of going to. 4x now I've went with 40min before I had to pick up my son to grab my son some potato wedges and popcorn chicken in their 2 go cup, never once have I been able to do this. I am done going now, only 2x was I even able to place the order (I've waited over 10min to be greeted in store and drive through) both times I've been able to order I was asked if I could wait an additional 20-30min because they didn't have the potato wedges or popcorn chicken ready. Whoever owns this location must be losing a bunch of money and only your management team to thank for your losses."}
{"text":"The people that work here are very friendly and the place looks clean, although I did not go into the ladies room. I had a take out bucket of extra crispy. I got it home about 10 minuets later and found the chicken dry, dry, dry.  I had gotten there about 4:45 PM and thought that I would get fresh chicken, but I was wrong. I don't know if this was left over from lunch, or if it had been pre-made for the dinner rush but it was so dry that I had to dig through my fridge to find something to put on it to allow me to chew it. All in all, I ended throwing out more than half of it.  To top it off, I did the questionnaire on line telling them how bad it was and never heard back. I guess they just don't care. Won't go back there again as this isn't the first time I got a bum deal. The last time I wanted all white meat for my one bucket and mixed for the other and they said they had to save white meat chicken for the other customers. I ask them then why they didn't just make up more white meat and they said that then they would have too much dark meat left over. At that time I canceled my order and went across the street to the fish place and got my stuff. I should have known."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service went to the drive-through they got my order wrong when I got home I called it's my fault the my order was wrong that's what I was told. They told me to bring the food back to get the right order When they gave me the right order it didn't have everything I had and in their original order probly won't be back I'll get my half a star if I could terrible"}
{"text":"Went and ordered 4 crispy chicken wings meal the wing is dripping with grease. I called and asked if I could bring them back to replace the wings with original wings that they didn't have when I ordered. I received the original wings and the had very little breading and seemed under cooked. Needless to say it will be a long time before I order there again."}
{"text":"This is 2 days in a row now. I love this place. The food is freshly cooked and the staff is so friendly. They make you feel very welcome and I just had the best chicken sandwich ever."}
{"text":"I understand that this is KFC. And the food's quality is pretty much comparable to every other KFC. However, the customer service here was spot on. I was very impressed. Staff went above and beyond to accommodate me. Definitely not your typical fast food service!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge KFC fan, but I heard about their chicken pot pies and had to try them out for myself. We asked for three pies, but they only had two pies ready to sell, the next pies would have been ready 19 minutes later. When I got my pie, I could see why. I was expecting a tiny, microwaveable pie, but what I got was much better! This was definitely a hearty meal. The pie had lots of yummy crust on the outside and a wealth of chicken, carrots, peas, and potatoes inside. It was delicious. And I believe it was only $3.99, with a drink included! I will definitely be revisiting KFC for these pies, especially."}
{"text":"I'm only giving a one star rating because I can't give a half star/no star rating. This is beyond the worst service. The worker and manager on duty were messing around, yelling inside for 5 minutes before they even came to the window. The worker started yelling at the manager to help her in front of my boyfriend and I, she then asked us to pull up along with three other cars. After waiting 15 minutes for our food they didn't get it right. After all that waiting, we finally just gave up, and left. This location sucks :)"}
{"text":"Went to day and had a family meal for all five of us for $20 and had leftovers. It was clean and the workers were very helpful and service was fast."}
{"text":"Waited for my order at drive thru and found out when we got home they did not give us potatoe wedge instead got mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday around 5 pm to pick up dinner. The people in front of me wanted to order a 20 piece bucket and so did I. The cashier went in the back kitchen to check on Supply after I chimed in that I wanted a 20 piece bucket also. He came back and informed the people in front of me that they could only have a 10 piece bucket because they had no more.  They wouldn't have anymore for approximately a half hour if they wanted to wait.  They took 10 pieces. I asked the cashier if they were really out of ALL styles of KFC chicken and he said yes. I asked him why they had no chicken ready at dinner hour. His reply was \"I don't know but you can wait about a half hour for it.\" I said that if they really have no chicken ready at dinner hour their store was in real trouble and that they should get going and fill up. We walked out and picked up Chinese food. Made fresh and quick. Maybe one more chance for these guys or El Pollo Loco or Popeye's or Church's. So on 5/1/18 we call this store's phone number that was listed on Google Maps and get an obnoxious girl making sexually explicit comments.  We hang up and look up your Spring Mtn location through YELP, call that different number and after 20+ rings, no answer so we hang up. I WAS going to tell them about the incorrect listing in GOOGLE MAPS but hey, they can't even answer the phone. So guess what?  POPEYE'S it is. No more of THAT KFC location."}
{"text":"Seriously KFC? Your new ad campaign brought us in. The service and conditions will insure we never come back. I've never seen a chain restaurant this dirty (and I've dined at The Waffle House). The floors are dirty, the tables are dirty... All of them and the staff doesn't care. I love fried chicken, thank goodness Popeye's is expanding."}
{"text":"Theyre usually great but today we were rushed through the drive thru and our orders were cold :( :( 2 kfc bowls both cold,  asked for tenders with wedges recieved mashed potatoes instead no fork,  3 drinks asjed for no ice got ice anyway ... ehh thinking im gonna start using another location :("}
{"text":"Had a pretty bad experience with this KFC in particular. I ordered a toasted wrap of the menu and they literally put popcorn chicken on the wrap rather than the chicken strips they usually do! I didn't even realize until I got to work, I was pretty disappointed cause I love KFC .. But Definately not this store."}
{"text":"Had not been to KFC in a while- this location in particular seems short staffed. They had nothing on hand and I had to wait 10 mins+ for wedges, that part i don't mind because at least they made them fresh. We waited about 8 mins for spoons. 5 minutes for Honey, we didn't dare ask for ketchup. Chicken was good, nothing impressive, mashed potatoes seemed old and dry. We did get here during the dinner rush ( right before) needless to say we could have waited longer!"}
{"text":"After seeing the \"I Ate The Bone\" campaign on TV, I decided to give them another try. I was disappoint to discover that their boneless chicken is nothing more than over-priced chicken strips. The manager at the register was friendly but I felt as I got \"duped\" by the commercial."}
{"text":"Super skeptical about coming in after reading all the horrible reviews... Had the best service ever! We told them what we were wanting, and they totally made it happen. It was much less expensive then I had imagined it to be as well. The girl that took our order was Natali. She was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Change the damn hours on here, they're not open at 1145pm let alone 1.  Yelp quit wasting my fucking time"}
{"text":"Every time I come here the chicken is never ready. If you decide to wait they always say it will take about 5-10 min but in reality it takes 45-60 min. Just going to stop coming here altogether."}
{"text":"Usually it's 3 strikes your out... however, I am going with 2 strikes this time... been going here for about 5-6 years... the last 2 times were horrible... 

Wait times are ALWAYS horrible.... don't know if they are short staffed, under staffed, or just don't give a care about their customers. That is even with 1 car in the drive through. 

Asking for extra pickles on the chicken littles is like asking for God to give you a billion dollars, you won't get it. 

Potato wedges... don't expect these to be finger friendly either... they are normally so soft that they fall apart. Have to use a fork  and add seasoning just to eat them.

July 4th, we tried to order the 10 for $10 legs/thighs ORIGINAL.... the order taker claimed that they had no original and tried to get us to order crispy or grilled. Strike 1. If a customer is requesting chicken with skin on (ORIGINAL) that is SOFT... they don't want crispy and they sure don't want something without skin.

Last night (7/22) ... same location...  we ordered the 10 for $10 legs/thighs ORIGINAL with mashed potatoes and gravy. Got it home. The chicken tasted old. The skin was crunchy... not the good kind of crunch either. It was a whole bucket of OLD icky chicken. Strike 2. 

This location has gone down hill. We will be going out of our way to the 19th ave and Union Hills location from now on.  

DO NOT EAT AT THIS LOCATION. THE TIME, SERVICE, and FOOD is not worth it.. and they just don't care.
If I could give zero stars I would at this point."}
{"text":"Just got home to find my large order of mash potatoes are like a soupy water...even worse they tasted like sour cream....gross!! Threw away. Not to mention trying to order in the drive thru was a 10 min process for 3 things. Never going back, now I know why it was so dead."}
{"text":"Every time we go to this location they forget something in our order and act like we're inconveniencing  them so we stopped going for a while but it's close to home so I thought I'll give it  another chance so I went after work I got there at probably 10:30 pm and when I got to the speaker it said this location is closed on the screen they have but underneath it said open until 11 so i thought something was off with the speaker so I waited a few minutes and no one had come on to the speaker so I decided to drive to the window just in case when I got to the window I was there for a few minutes because I saw someone inside but it looked like they were ignoring me like when I scooted my car up slightly to be able to get there attention they moved over again so it was harder to see them finally someone came to the window and asked if I didn't want to order at the speaker and I said I tried but no one was there and she said well I'll guess I'll take your order here acting very annoyed and when I said what I wanted she said oh we're out of that so I said what about something else and she ended up saying we're out of that for everything I wanted so I said never mind and drove away to another nicer location but I was so irritated at how rude they were you can't just hide from customers cause you don't want to do your job"}
{"text":"Drive thru service was good but the family was all excited about the new double coated crispy chicken.  YUK!  They are using their regular coating twice not accounting for the additional SALT.  WAY TOO SALTY. Plus the \"double coating\" doesn't adhere well. What a disappointment after spending $24 bucks! Do the executives EVER taste their food????"}
{"text":"Just like any other KFC but they do have a lunch buffet. Right now they're building a gas station next door so theirs only one way in and out and the driveway is kinda narrow. The one downside is that their menu outside is not up to date. So u order one thing and their like \"we don't offer that n e more\". Well come outside and update ur menu it's not rocket science...smh"}
{"text":"Its been quite a while since I have eaten KFC. i was craving fried chicken so i ventured here today. I never knew KFC had a eat in buffet, perhaps if i had the time, I wouldve done that route. A simple 2 piece with 1 side completed my order. Quick, easy, greasy, and I regretted eating it 3 hours later sums up my visit."}
{"text":"Sorry but I have to do this I came to off on Thursday may 7th to participate in customer appreciation day (8piece mix for 7.99) sound like a great deal I was excited for my meal. First off I wasn't impress with the guy speaking over the intercom (he didn't sound welcoming at all ) with my coupon i waited 20 minutes in the drive thur for food before I even had gotten to the window to pay. I still remained humbled and waited an extra 5 minutes no one came to charge me for my order or even to say sorry and that they had difficulties expediting orders.  I would've waited longer then but I had no customer service reaction with any of employees. As I looked inside employees where talking to each other as if everyone was confused if this was my business I would start doing drug screening! There is no reason I should have waited almost a half hour for FASTFOOD! So far WORST KFC I've been too in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Will never go here again. Food was cold and overpriced for what we got. They were out of a lot of their sides and when I asked KFC to contact me via their website they never did. I'm not a person that sends back food and when I have bad service I try to assume they are busy or it's just an off day. But in this case avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"The FDA needs to check this place. Don't eat here. I ordered food to go with cold ice water. I drank the entire cup of water and was still thirsty so I opened the lid to add in more water. I had a new warm bottle of water and wanted it to be cold so I added it to the cup of ice. Half way pouring it in I noticed lots of black dots floating in the cup. Super unsanitary and unacceptable. I took off some of the ice on top n took a picture so you guys can see. Filthy dirty never eating at this location again."}
{"text":"It almost expected to have your order messed up when you get your food. Even the simplest things cannot be done correctly. How hard is it to input the right order into the computer and then give that order to the customer? The $5 fill up is a great promotion that in theory would work well but time and time again I have gotten home and discovered that I was missing a cookie, biscuit or even mashed potatoes from my meal. Disappointing. The only way I'll go now is if I eat inside the restaurant so I can at least go back up to the counter and get the food they missed."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at this location yesterday. Haven't gone to this location in a while even though it is close to my house, service had been just so so. Young man named Shay at he window was just the most pleasant ant helpfully person I have come across lately, thanks for perking up my day.  Also my boyfriend liked the Nashville spicy chicken strips alot."}
{"text":"This KFC never fails to disappoint. This is the second time in the last two months that around 8:30 pm they have run out of crispy chicken. I've actually only tried them these two times. I wasn't the only car to drive away without ordering. My girlfriend said let's try Churchs and was a good idea. The biscuits were better and the Cole slaw had the same flavor except a different cut. The chicken wasn't bad either. Don't know if the KFC has bad or indifferent owners or management or they don't know what's going on in their restaurant."}
{"text":"Horrible service and the tightest drive-thru I've been through. 
My order takes forever and if you buy the hot wings- you be lucky if they have enough. They always apologize if they are short-handed or it takes another 20 minutes to cook more. Be sure to check your order because they screw my mother's order 3 times and the employees had no sympathy. 
As for the drive-thru, my father complained to the manager that the corner was too tight and they have done nothing about it. I've seen many SUVs in front of me having trouble making the left turn...and some getting scratched up from the pole! 
Never going back here again unless they fix how they run business- for now I'll drive the extra mile to find a better KFC in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"No longer offering meals without having to get a soft drink and only 1 side. I asked if I could substitute a side instead of a drink and got a no but you can spend more to get an extra side. Of course the girl at the drive thru said this change happened today. That's my luck. I guess i should stick to Boston Market."}
{"text":"We frequent this KFC about once every two months or so as it's in our neighborhood and a nice little walk. Plus who doesn't love the Famous Bowl or pot pie? So yeah, it's a fast food restaurant and we know the quality of food we're getting before walking in the door. I want to post about the quality of service. Each time I am there the workers are so nice. On a visit today the staff working were so incredibly nice and patient as we couldn't decide on our specific orders and what we did and didn't want. People like to complain and see management if they feel slighted in some way. The service we received from two teenage girls was so friendly that it was worth a few minutes to speak with their manager. Typically I'd give 3 stars because as mentioned before the service is always good but the kindness today pushes that to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Four stars for a KFC inside a gas station?? You might be thinking, \"Has this b|tch lost her mind??\" 

Well ya'll just hear me out...

When you're a mom tryin' to make it on your own, the drive thru is your friend.  How'd you like to drag a baby out of a car when it's 112 outside just to get somethin' to eat?  Or work 60 hours a week and then have to go home and cook?  NO THANKS. 

This KFC is located on Craig right before you get on the 15 inside the Pilot travel center...which makes it sooooo convenient to stop by on my way home.  They are sooooooo FRIENDLY and FAST!!!  I order at the drive-thru and my food is always ready before I get to the window.  I don't know how they do it!  Thomas is especially friendly and I'm always glad to have him take my order.  

Also the food is always correct and hot and fresh.  And they always ask if I want extras like hot sauce, honey, butter, etc.  And this might sound weird but their soda is really good....like the carbonation to syrup ratio is perfect.  A pepsi from here will just about take your breath away.  

It might be a total dump inside...I wouldn't know...but for my purposes this place is great."}
{"text":"After waiting several minutes for an old homeless man with a shopping cart to exit the drive-thru, I placed my order and pulled up to the window.  Within two minutes, I had my three piece white meat meal with mashed potatoes and green beans ($8.19), or so I thought.  I arrived home only to discover instead of mashed potatoes, I was given coleslaw.  I detest coleslaw!!! 
I was planning on feeding the potatoes to my baby.  Thanks, KFC."}
{"text":"My order is wrong every time! Last time I had to wait 10 min just to order.  Then another 20 min for my food.  Only to find out once I got to work my food wasn't even all there. That was the last straw....never again."}
{"text":"They are slower than molasses in the winter. I am in drive thru 20 min and still waiting"}
{"text":"Don't bother coming if it's past 9:30pm. The manager will already have the lights off so you won't even be able to read the menu. Also, he'll tell you there pretty much out of everything... white meat, dark meat, biscuits etc. Take your ass to Churches chicken !"}
{"text":"This store # 86 on boulder hwy and Nellis is the WORST! I have been to that store at different times and the place is completely empty inside and no one is in the drive thru but they never have any food ready. I pull up to the side of the building so their timer doesn't keep going and it can seem like their service is quick . After waiting for a minimum of 5 minutes they bring the food out only to have an incomplete order"}
{"text":"I really don't know what I was expecting..

KFC seems to be trying to get out of the fast food category and more into a well-beloved chipotle-like aura (even with the decor, which is a blatant rip-off).

I got a Fresh Deluxe chicken burger & a Mango Salad. My meal was around $15, and I am still sitting at work, hungry as ever. 

The burger was more like a slider with the tiniest an thinnest piece of cold deep fried chicken you can imagine. It wasn't even warm enough to melt any of the cheddar.

The mango salad was slopped together with \"grilled chicken\" that looked more like it had been steaming all day, waiting to get into my regretful stomach. 

This was one of the worst lunches I've ever had in this area. Teaches me a lesson not to cheat on my usual family-owned burger joints! Yuck!

P.S. I even saw two homeless people come in, look at the menu, and leave. They had the right idea!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Every time we have come here we have nothing but issues. The staff is rude, and there is always an issue with the order. The only reason we come here is how close it is to our house but from now on we are just going to drive else where. I have never been to a KFC that is run as horrible as this one is. I wish I could give less than 1 star because this place doesn't even deserve that 1. The staff needs a real lesson in customer service from management on down. They have consistently run out of product and get an attitude when you ask how long it is going to take for new stuff to be cooked."}
{"text":"Went here with my grandma and friend. Shannon was running the cash register when we arrived and she was amazing! I'm not usually one for fast food or for giving them good reviews but Shannon's? service made it worth 5 stars.  My friend ordered something and she pointed out a meal deal that was perfect.  My grandma ordered something and didn't like it and Shannon was right there to fix it and make it right without us even asking.  Her professionalism and anticipation of customer needs makes her an awesome customer service employee and representative of the company.  Thank you so much for being so great to my grandmother. I really appreciate your display of kindness and thoughtfulness."}
{"text":"This was the worst fast food experience I have ever had. My family and I stopped her for a quick bite to eat and waited over 15 minutes for our food. When the food finally showed up it was incomplete, we had to go back up to the counter to request utensils which I stood and waited saying \"excuse me\" for over five minutes before anyone even acknowledged me standing there. While all of this was happening there was an employee standing in the back playing with their fingernails rather than doing ANYTHING! The food was mediocre, and service was awful we will not be returning to kfc anytime soon. Please stay away."}
{"text":"Really tough to understand the order taker who couldn't speak clear English. Food was tepid and dry."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been relocated into a newly constructed building.  The restaurant's decor looks very nice and modern.  The buffet is conveniently placed in the dining room,  The employees were very nice and my order came out correct.

I cannot give this place 5 stars.  This is a new building.  It should have a 100% sanitation grade.  The dining area wasn't filthy but did need some attention.  Many of the tables were dirty.  They weren't busy and a BUNCH of tables were dirty.  Somebody was falling back on their job."}
{"text":"Kfc is good and the only chicken place around if you wanna grab something quick and not the traditional fast food. But this location is horrific!! I always have to wait 10-15 minutes in the parking lot after ordering through the drive through. For whatever reason they always running out of chicken and the last time I came my order was wrong when I got home. I rather travel to a location 20 miles from home near my job than continue to patronize this poor service."}
{"text":"This is for the location off Mineral Point.
We ordered the breast with cole slaw and mashed potatoes plus 1 drumstick.
We got one breast, one corn (not ordered), no cole slaw (ordered), and a bowl full of gravy with a spoon full of potatoes.
Over priced.
The manager insisted the mashed poatoes \"comes like that\".
There was a 10 minute wait for a drum stick so we passed.
Avoid!"}
{"text":"This was the worst KFC on E Bell Road, I have driven thru!!!! Makita.. I believe her name tag read was rude, unapologetic, and got my order wrong twice. Then overcharged me. Obviously her mind and attitude were preoccupied somewhere else. I like the food there. But this drive thru lady, I have had several encounters with her and each time mistakes were made. She definitely needs a refresher course in courtesy. The colonel wouldn't like it!!!!"}
{"text":"I come here because I live in the area and it is convenient.. Noticed that the food tastes better and seems more consistent.  Seems like new management and team in this place... I will keep a tab on how things are going here.. 

Note about KFC:
KFC has a detailed process to follow when making chicken.. it starts to taste like crap when staff cut corners or try to do it their own way.   I think this new staff has been trained from the ground up.. I hope Management can keep the standards."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite and all I can say is it was horrific! The chicken must've been fried 10 time, the mashed potatoes were watery beyond believe. I might as well have been drinking gravy!"}
{"text":"This place and service is terrible. The facility itself was dirty, the tables were not wiped down people were literally standing waiting for their orders to takeout..the racks in the back were empty the staff were clueless as to what was going on...I didnt see a manager anywhere, I did wait on my order as it was already 715. The meal was horrible..I will go elsewhere and it wont be KFC~"}
{"text":"They need to lay off the ice. More than 3/4 of my drink was full to the top of ice. Two sips and you're done. Is it worth 7 bucks for a crappy meal? Nope!"}
{"text":"No wonder all the 1 star reviews.  This place is straight trash.  Workers are lazy and turn the fryers off 45 min to an hour prior to closing.  They are always out of stuff and just seem more like a place for kids to hang out vs work.  Who ever owns or runs this place better make some changes soon unless they like no business.  I suggest looking elsewhere if you are hungry because this place is very substandard."}
{"text":"If I could give this is 0 stars I would every single time we try this place and try to have faith in it again it always lets us down time and time again they always get our orders wrong"}
{"text":"I wish I could do no stars. My husband and I went twice to this place and it was terrible. Both times the order was incorrect, it was like a fight just to get it corrected. They tried to double and triple charge us. They had a horrible attitude. The chicken was so tough it was like jerky. The green beans were horribly bland and the mash potatoes were a nightmare. We will never be visiting KFC again in Vegas. I'll wait till I am traveling elsewhere."}
{"text":"3 times in a month only take cash and no chicken strips. On same 3 visits the order not just wrong. Epicly wrong. Called 800 number to just see if this was a common practice transferred 3 times to get someone who spoke English. No such luck. This KFC sets the bar for the worst service in the valley."}
{"text":"Best for take-out only. No seats for waiting. Standing room only.  Dropped by co we got promo for 12pc chicken at $19.00. It's cool! It would be great if this drop by branch was designed for drive thru."}
{"text":"Horrible service and the chicken is never cooked. Also they are always out of pot pies. Not going back."}
{"text":"We went to this location because of the Cavs All In for $20 sign in front of the business.
Drive-Thur stated that we can't get that.
So why do you have the sign that states that?
Don't have the time or money to waste at this place.
Drive-Thur sign isn't lite properly, isn't positioned properly.
I want be back."}
{"text":"Sitting in front of the store as I write this waiting on my food that I ordered through drive through. Never ever fails at this location no matter the time of day you roll into this location they never have what you want when you want it. Today I'm waiting on potato wedges. Last time is was pull up and wait for the popcorn chicken. Time before that was popcorn chicken as well.  Place is clean staff is friendly better than the next closest one on S Durango that's a dump stay away messy and always understaffed. Well my four minute wait is well pst in still sitting waiting."}
{"text":"Back again for the food which is good here but the inside as nice as it looks from the eye is a dump. Once again short staffed only two employees on duty mid day today.  Waited a bit to order. Took a while to find one small table that was clean enough to sit at. The rest were filthy dirty sticky needing wipe downs. The trash can next to side door overflowing. The beverage dispenser orange soda basically spitting out orange water the syrup was out same with the brisk iced tea. Had to settle for a drink I didn't want. I'd recommend drive through but not dining in here sadly."}
{"text":"This place can literally CLOSE and it would not be missed. We live five minutes from here, we hadn't been here in almost 2 years because their service SUCKS. No matter when we used to go there, they would NEVER get the order correct and we would end up with the wrong sides or whichever. Tonight, we sat in the drive thru line for at least 15 minutes, and I'm being very nice when I say 15 minutes because I'm sure it was more like 20-25. When we got to the window, they didn't even know what the hell we ordered! The guy at the window blamed it on the fact that they have \"a new guy\". That SHOULD NOT make any difference. When they have continually had bad service for almost five years now (that's how long we've lived near this location) they really just need to close the restaurant and call it quits! I don't know if they just get overwhelmed by the amount of people at dinner time, or if it's the lack of working employees at dinner time, either way, AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE! My only suggestion would be a complete OVERHAUL of their staff. But even then, I don't know that that would make this location any better."}
{"text":"I dont recommend this place. I mean the workers are quite friendly, but I could barely communicate with them because they were on a rush. They spoke too fast. Also, I ordered 4 pieces of chicken with fries, and the size and the flavour were quite disappointing to me."}
{"text":"I do like KFC every now and then. The food is always good at this one; when you finally get the right food. The employees don't seem to enjoy their jobs at all. And they always make you feel like they are doing me a favor.  All I ask for is to pay attention, get my order correct and smile!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has a low score, I've been here a few times over the last few months, and its been fine. Its a KFC, are you expecting cloth napkins and table service???

Thought I'd write a review today because I went through the drive thru and ordered a $5 meal with biscuit, and they actually put in my bag....wait for it......BUTTER and HONEY!!! I can't tell you how many times I've been to KFC and have NOT gotten butter and/or honey. I didn't even have to ask...wow! Bonus star for that. 

Earlier this year they ran a special...chicken pot pie for $2.99 on Tuesdays....great deal and I love their chicken pot pie. 

I can't believe I wrote a review for a fast food restaurant. I apologize in advance to the foodies."}
{"text":"Went through the drive through and first off the drive through girl who was filling in for the girl on break was very rude. I told the girl who came back from break to tell the other girl to watch her attitude. 

No reason to be rude and have an attitude over the intercom. 

Her greeting wasn't said clearly so I asked her what she said again & she huffed and then repeated what she said the first time with a snarky attitude, and I wasn't impressed. There was no reason for that behavior."}
{"text":"Worst KFC I have ever been to. Takes forever. If they have to handle at least 4 customers prepare to wait at least minimum of a half hour for your fast food. They overcharge you, they won't match the Mesa store price for my 4 piece and sometimes they don't get the order right. I go to the one in Mesa. I get charged over a dollar less for the same meal and they get the order right. Quicker too. Scottsdale (Indian School) KFC is horrible. Don't bother going."}
{"text":"Check your order before you leave! Very sad that you place a order and when you get home, it's all wrong! Ordered the $20 deal, 8 pcs. of chicken, extra order of mash potatoes and gravy, order of potato wedges and a drink. The $20 deal is 8 pieces of chicken, 2 breasts, 2 legs, 2 thighs and 2 wings with order of mash potatoes and gravy and biscuits. No potato wedges and 1 chicken breast, no chicken wings? Instead, they substituted 4 drumsticks! Didn't say: Sorry, we do not have this, can we substitute this? No condiments or napkins, just either not properly trained or lazy! Really, really disappointed! Called and spoke with manager and she apologized but it was like she was not there? So now on a list if or when I come back, I will get my potato wedges. Food was ok, outside heat was hotter than the chicken. Has everyone forgotten about customer service? Very sad!"}
{"text":"I'm going to be generous today. This KFC usually isn't the fastest and usually is busy as hell. But!!!! Yesterday I went and the cashier was glowing he was so friendly and prompt he explained options to people and actually seemed like he cared about doing his best in his roll and I was impressed with that. Also I got fried chicken the crispy kind it's better then the regular so do that."}
{"text":"If I could rate less then one star I would. This place has always been a joke. My parents asked me to get them some wings cause they had a craving so I obliged, took 15 minutes in line mostly cause the one and only person at the till disappeared for 10 minutes to get a basket of ketchup while there was 6 people in line. Twenty minutes after my order I finally got my chicken... So that's 35 minutes to simply get my food... I ordered wings only... That's it.

Over all avoid this place like the plague. Their Yelp rating is 1.5/5 so that should be a clue."}
{"text":"Incompetent idiots that work there. Asked me three times to confirm my order and then I get home and my order is still wrong! It's not that hard. So now I either go back because my kids food isn't in there and my kids go to bed late or I have to make them something else to eat after I just spent $30 for food that wasn't even my order. Not to mention the girl at the window threw the packets of honey and butter at us because she was annoyed that we asked and said \"here!\" plus she gave us enough to supply us for the rest of the month. Rude, incompetent,wasteful."}
{"text":"At kfc last time took 20 minutes.. It's 5:54 just placed my order.. Been 6 minutes still two cars ahead of me. 8 minutes paying now.. Once they open the window.. Been 10 minutes, waiting for my change - here he is. 6:07 here's the food! 
13 minutes a little better.. Considering i got more food this time I'll take it. Maybe just the night shift workers don't have there shit together."}
{"text":"ow I have an honest question, would you consider the double down a burger? A chicken burger? Or maybe it's better known as a chicken sandwich? Nonetheless, I decide to put it in the burger section of my blog. I decided that since it's a limited engagement for the double down, I better try it while I still got the chance. So I decided to get the combo and mannn was it expensive. $8.99 for the double down... *blinks twice*, that's right $8.99 + tax. It's an expensive fast food choice for something kinda small.

So I made my purchase and got my takeout. In case you're not sure what the double down is.. it's 2 deep fried boneless chicken fillets with 2 slices of bacon, 2 slices of cheese and the Colonel's special sauce. It's pretty much a heart attack waiting to happen, but the funny thing is if you look at the nutritional value (listed below):

- 1,380 mg of sodium
- 540 calories
- 32 grams of fat

Yeah that's right it's the sodium level that's crazy and surprisingly not really the calories. I mean the grams of fat is expected but the amount of sodium.. ouch. Anywho, I decided to dive in. The minute you pick it up you can feel the greasy and it makes its way down your hand quite quickly. I took a bite and I can't put my word on it.. but it doesn't taste very good. There's a certain taste to the double down and man was it salty. I had to gulp down my drink just after two bites. I wanted to take one more bite to really see if it was just me or was it really just that salty. Not only does it taste bad and salty... but the mesh of all the ingredients just doesn't go well together. I think it might be the cheesy.. heck maybe even the sauce. I'm not 100% sure to be honest. But what I do know is that I don't like it and I don't recommend it to anyone. If you really want chicken, just go for the regular stuff at KFC and get yourself a bucket. If you have extra money to spare, go to Popeye's."}
{"text":"Restaurant review
Why 4 stars for a KFC, because of good service and fast food prep. I came by here recently to grab a family meal for lunch and was expecting slow and unfriendly service. It was the exact opposite. They were quick to take my order and even gave me back the coupon to use again for next time. My food came out as I ordered hot and fresh. i took it home and again checked out my order which was filled perfectly. Yes this is KFC food, but for fast food the fried chicken was seasoned well not too salty and very moist. It almost rivals Popeye chicken, just wish KFC would have a spicy variety of the chicken

Pros: friendly staff, quick, large parking lot

Cons: it is unhealthy food and yes it is still KFC

Hidden deals:
Check out the mailer for coupons. 5 dollar meal combo"}
{"text":"Restaurant review
I'm surprised by the negative reviews for this restaurant, but you do have to keep in mind this is a KFC after all. You have these a different standard when evaluating this. I ended up coming here take lunch out. I was pleasantly surprised by how fast my order was taken and how fast my food came as well. I ordered the lunchtime combo which included chicken a biscuit a cookie and a side. The chicken itself was prepared well with oil that was fresh. Overall I really have no complaints about this restaurant except the parking lot is rather small. If I crave fried chicken I will be back. The service here was also friendly and I had no issues

Pros: Cheap lunchtime meal combos

Cons: Not healthy

{"text":"This is the second time I've been here in probably 2 years , and I remember why I've skipped this location  . Long drive -thru wait times and terrible food . As I was waiting in the line I  just had this feeling the  food was going to be bad , would have pulled off but the drive-thru's design doesn't allow you to leave once you're in :/. Pot-pie tasted liked it had been sitting under the heat lamp for a week  and my cinnamon bon bites had to have been microwaved . Do yourself a favor and don't come here :( . Here's to another 2 years of avoidance ."}
{"text":"Holy moley this KFC is a dump. That's a lot considering not too many of them are up there in the jack in the box class of american dumps to eat.  You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This place is just horrible. Lunch time went through drive through ordered 3 piece chicken tender meal. The chicken tenders were probably made this morning like 4 hours ago. Impossible to chew and runner like. Compare this to Raising Canes chicken tenders this place is a joke."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, always out of chicken. They have been rude to me every time I've been here they have been terrible at there job."}
{"text":"By far the worst KFC I've ever been to my husband and I ordered the 12 piece Bucket meal deal three large sides and what was suppose to be six biscuits which we only received four, not to mention that's not even the worst part my husband was eating the chicken and got to the middle to notice that most of the chicken in the middle was bloody and pink and tasted very slimy after a long day of work not noticing what he was eating he just figured it was a bad batch then he noticed that he had eaten raw chicken, my husband started feeling sick an hour later I did not touch the chicken or bothered to see if the whole bucket was raw I just threw it out I would not recommend eating here unless you want to get food poisoning stay away from warm springs Henderson KFC if that doesn't keep you away know that you can't call to make a complaint because they do not except calls horrible save your money $33 just ain't worth getting food poisoning!"}
{"text":"KFC. What I thought was always a dependable source of decent, quick and tasty fried chicken has lost some of its pull when they decided to offer the grilled chicken alternative. 

I can understand in a business stand-point on why they started to offer the grilled selection. I don't see how they are actually cooking the chicken itself and if it is truly grilled as they claim. 

When I bit into one of these \"grilled\" chickens, it was almost the texture of a rubber tire and as greasy as their fried counter-parts. The portion was quite small and the taste was far from anything grilled that I have tasted before. It did have some fake grill lines as to promote that they are actually grilled. I beg to differ.

I remember when they used to serve a roasted chicken selection which was a huge favorite for myself and some of my friends, however, they discontinued it a long time ago and never brought it back. I really miss it. 

So what is KFC doing exactly? I have no clue. The executive team probably thought it was a brilliant idea to bring grilled chicken to compete with El Pollo Loco or some other similar grilled chicken joint. They need to stick to what they know best and continue to make a good product. KFC also seemed to have modernized their stores a bit. I find it a little odd, but ok I will take it. 

As for a fried chicken fast food joint, KFC still takes the cake as far as taste goes. I just hope they don't make stupid blunders like this whole marketing campaign to try their rubbery, tasteless, heaping pile of crap they decided was their \"hot\" new product."}
{"text":"False Advertisement! They close at 10pm instead of at 11pm. Came out here late at night hoping to get some Fried chicken but turned out they are closed and apparently there are other customers who are fooled by this too. Other than that, this store offers some good fried chicken. I especially like the Nashville hot wings."}
{"text":"I love kfc's mashed potatoes... They are just downright glorious. However, the last two times I've gone to this location, there has been more breading than chicken, the chicken strips have been stale as all get out, and my mashed potatoes were far less than glorious; in fact, they've been down right mediocre at best. Last night, my roommate and I went to grab some dinner and I could barely eat my chicken strips they were so hard. My potatoes were cold and the service was just awful. The service was slow, they got our drinks wrong, and the employees were really rude. I'm not sure I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Dont even think of soing a drive through here!!!!! We wanted to order crispy chicken and they said there's gonna be a wait but we still said yes thinkin it was only a 10minute max wait, turned out it went on to 30-45mins!!! We waited me and my sons in our car!!!! Too rude costumer service as well!!!! Poor manager to have staff like this!!!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable wait times! Like every fast food place nowadays, they take your money, and then ask you to pull forward to avoid their counter timer. I'm sure that I'm not the only one who has noticed this trend. I really wish these businesses would figure out a better system. It seems to make the times longer instead of shorter. I'm writing this review while currently sitting for about 9 Minutes in the Drive-Thru of this location. It was at 9 minutes when I started writing this review and now as I get my food it has been 20 min. I will not be coming back to this location again."}
{"text":"Stopped by here this afternoon to pick up some lunch and I think today was the best customer service that I've had at this location. I usually avoid getting KFC since this location is the closest to me but I had a hankering for fried chicken and when you get a craving, you just need to fulfill it.

So I got the two piece smokehouse BBQ basket which comes with a small mashed potato and gravy and a biscuit, and I got a coleslaw for $1 extra. I thought the chicken skin was a little too salty and the smokehouse bbq sauce makes it even saltier, so even though the skin is the best part of fried chicken, I couldn't eat it since it was so salty. But everything was prepared super quickly and my food was hot when I got it.

The cashier was super polite and nice to me. I didn't think to get her name but she was totally awesome and super friendly and had a smile on her face the entire time and for all of the customers that came after me. And not everyone can do that, so props to her!!"}
{"text":"Good food. Ordered $15 leg & thigh family special. Got the mix with wings & breasts. Politely mentioned it to the new cashier. Not her fault, but not interested in mentioning it to the manager, as I explained what the big sign said, she said we got it. I said they packed it wrong. Still not interested.  Raised thousands of chickens. We know the difference."}
{"text":"Bad service at this location and they over charged me on my bank statement! My receipt and bank statement do not match. Do not recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Went to get dinner at 7 pm and they had no chicken. Was quoted a 25 minute wait for chicken. It's KFC they sell chicken how do you not have chicken? The staff was rude and seemed offended when I didn't want to wait 25 minutes for food!!!"}
{"text":"They had no chicken!!!! At 7:15pm on a Wednesday. No great deals or any real reason to be out chicken!!!"}
{"text":"Stay away from this dumb,it's always out of food and they'll lie to you about availability of sides and chicken. I will never go to this location again. Everyone there needs to be fired or the place needs to be shut down but somethings got to give."}
{"text":"Came in here yesterday with my husband.  Joseph was extremely helpful! I have a severe dairy allergy and I wanted to order off of the long John silvers menu. He double checked and made sure that everything I ordered was dairy free. After he took our order he went out and cleaned off all the tables in the dining room! Talk about a hard worker! The food came out fast and hot! The shrimp was fresh and tasty and the fish was excellent as well. We will definitely be coming back for more! Thanks for the great experience:)"}
{"text":"Terrible service. The chicken are old and dry. You will incur a service fee for using your Visa Debit card, they just won't let you select credit with the card. I stopped going here, better chicken and service at Popeye's on Craig a couple miles away."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here at Carl's Jr enjoying a burger even though I was set on having some chicken and gravy. Unfortunately, the workers tonight ignored us at the drive through. Yes they were still open when we showed up, in fact the drive through light was still on and you can see the employees inside. This is the second time this happened to me. The last time was a few months ago, when I pulled up the lady saw me, ran to the back and turned the lights off, with plenty of time before closing. Very disappointing :("}
{"text":"I hadn't eaten at a KFC in a long time, and never at this particular establishment.  I'm now sorry I hadn't visited here sooner.  The place was clean and well lit.  And, those who took and fulfilled my order were friendly and efficient.

There is just something about chomping down on the extra crispy coating of KFC Fried Chicken and digging into a large side of Cole Slaw that has just the right amount of liquid creaminess inside.   And, it is hard to go wrong with either Mashed Potatoes and Gravy or golden Potato Wedges.  This time I opted for the deep-fried potatoes and went with a to-go order of 10 pieces of Extra Crispy Chicken, substituting 1 breast for a thigh, and adding $!.00 to the price of the value bucket meal.  All food items were well prepared, and the included biscuits with honey and butter tasted fine, too!  Pieces were large, so Diane and I only finished 6 of 10 for dinner.  

We look forward to dispatching the remaining drumstick and thighs tomorrow for lunch!"}
{"text":"The crash from that \"extra tasty crispy\" high is pretty harsh."}
{"text":"Yes 3* solid on the drive true window.
12 minutes for my order 12 pcs of fingers i had to park on the side ok......
The kid on the window was nice but a bit slow on the pos system we only ask for one sauce and napkins But the chicken was hot and fresh. Just need  to be on the cook a bit more ... After all is fried chicken I would make sure to get napkins ask for well done and with plenty of time ill be inside the restaurant .
NOT THE DRIVE TRUE WINDOW."}
{"text":"I like all KFCs but tend to frequent this one for lunch. No matter which store you go to, the food is fairly consistent and the service always varies. Sometimes they're real nice, other times they're a-holes. A few days ago I happened to stop by at lunch, and well, low and behold; the gal at the drive through - total jerk. Can I just get a lil' hot sauce and ketchup with my order? Sheesh! 

Anywhooooo, we all know the fried chicken, popcorn chicken, mashed potatoes are pretty solid, so let's skip that for now. Do you remember all of the Oprah giveaways? I've never been to her show to get a new car or anything, but I was one of the lucky millions of people who got down with some free grilled chicken. 

Surprisingly, KFC's grilled chicken is pretty dang good. The only downside is that the chicken doesn't appear to be like hormone injected or juiced up on steroids like Ronnie from Jersey shore. They pieces are noticeably smaller than the fried chicken. Either way, yummy nonetheless."}
{"text":"Would give you 0 stars if I could. Over an hour until close and you have no chicken?
Just popcorn nuggets? Chicken Little's?
And to top it off, they handed me my drink and told me to have a goodnight without even giving me my food."}
{"text":"Brianna Gave me and my family one of the best services ever in my life....shouts out to you, kfc would be stupid to let you go."}
{"text":"The worst service. Honestly, what can you expect from a fast food place, but everyone there had no idea what they were doing. We were in the drive thru for 10 minutes with no line before someone acknowledged. Once we ordered, they told us they didn't have the ten piece meal, that we would have to wait 12 minutes. So we asked how many pieces they already had made-- and she went to go check and we waited another 6 minutes before we started calling into the box-- and she replied they only had white meat but they weren't willing to substitute the white meat in the drums and thigh ten piece meal. We were willing to wait but we were ignored. I finally pulled in to walk into the store and I asked for the manager and the drive thru girl and they both looked confused. So i asked for the store number which they didn't even know, and the girl starts yelling with an attitude because I pointed it out that she had terrible customer service skills."}
{"text":"I have been doing take away few times at this place and always been so slow. My last straw was when had to wait for 45 minutes for family menu due to they made the mistake three times. Forgetting the order made, getting the wrong chicken and forgotten the potato wedges. Including another 4 complains in the middle of the order which occupied their very very very slow attention of service. Worst part the cashier staff so disgustingly put my receipt in her mouth just because her hands full and gave it back that wet receipt with her germ to my hand. Are you serious, what kind of staff were you hiring. I didn't even touch that nasty receipt and left that horrible store and never come back.  With all the reviews and my experiences, this place need to be closed."}
{"text":"BEYOND DISSAPOINTED! The staff was rude, they were out of Dr Pepper, wedges, and tenders the only things we asked for. When we got to the window they didn't have any change so they paid us in nickels. When we got the food after 15 minutes of waiting, there was no biscuit in the refill box the mashed potatoes were dried up and old and in the mash bowl there was only chicken and mashed potatoes no cheese or corn. Don't ever go to this location!!"}
{"text":"Let's be clear, this gets 0 stars.

Went through the drive up and ordered the 12 piece tenders. We asked for BBQ sauce and Honey Mustard when we placed the order and at the window. The girl gave us 4 honey mustard cups(?) and no BBQ. No big deal. Once we get home we open the box and immediately we're disgusted. The tenders were dry and rubbery like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours. 

We tried calling twice and received no answer. After the failed calls we drove back. The girl at the window (who happened to be the one that forgot the BBQ sauce) told us to come wait inside, then corrected herself and asked us if we would like to come in. The place looked as though they hadn't cleaned it since they opened. There was trash and spills everywhere but there were only four people eating at one table inside. Not to mentioned it smelled as if someone used the restroom and left the door open.

All in all I will not be back this location."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and every time it's ridiculous how long they take to take your order, to complete the order and serve it. 
This is definitely my last time coming here. I'd rather drive further to be served faster or go to another chicken place. 
This location is not \"fast food\" it's super slow food service. 
Always 1 register operating and 5 people in back doing god knows what. 
At least the food is still decent. But not worth the 20 minute wait."}
{"text":"Love KFC.  Not bad location. Sometimes they don't count my chicken pieces and I get shorted. Or I get 1-2 bad pieces that are broken like broken drumsticks."}
{"text":"Don't ever go to this kfc , I went to the counter at 8:40pm stood at the counter while over 7 people are working on the shift all made eye contact with me never spoke a word to me just ignored me., for over 10 mins. Then I yelled out are you guys open to get some assistance and one of the employees responded with a NO . I got reau pissed and walked out. Worst experience ever at a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"Casey keeps things going here!  Friendly smile, happy tacos and burritos, and conveniently located across from Adobe golf center.  Cheap eats!"}
{"text":"The last time I went in there I observed: cross contamination, unfriendly service(no two part greeting), dirty rag BUCKETS left ON THE COUNTER where they set the tongs for serving food, no hand washing by employees, and confusion with my order although it was a simple one consisting of 12 strips.
Also, another customer came in while I was waiting and asked if they could prioritize her order because she was in a hurry. They said yes, but it resulted in a lot of confusion between employees which drastically slowed service time. The customer complained about the wait, which resulted in an indifferent response from a employee. He said \"if you wanted your order faster you should have called it in\". He said this with an attitude. Then he turned to me and asked if I thought he handled that correctly, and I said no. 
In the end, being a former employee of this establishment, I was very disappointed with the cleanliness and customer service."}
{"text":"I dislike making one star reviews.
I am disappointed at this location. 
We have been there numerous times and the quality of food as well as the service continues to decline time after time. 
Our order was incorrect again and the phone number on the receipt is a cellular phone that doesn't get answer \"this number has a voice mail that has not been set up yet\" (702) 771-0494.
The number on yelp (702) 633-4781 is busy all the time. 
The popcorn chicken is as hard as rocks. 
Save your money."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this establishment I am amazed how it manages to stay open with the employees that they staff. When I go to this Kentucky fried chicken they are out of their original recipe which is preposterous. Maybe they wouldn't be out of chicken if they didn't give away all of their product to friends of people that work there. While I was eating there tonight I paid $9.50 for a two piece meal (which they were out of breasts of original recipe) while two 16-year-old kids walked in and got $45 worth of food handed to them for free. This seems to be Desert Vista high school stomping grounds"}
{"text":"I am honestly surprised by all of the reviews that mention terrible service. The whole reason I wanted to write a review is because of the fast and friendly service that I always receive at this location. Granted, I've never gone inside. But the staff members that I have encountered at the window have always been smiley, friendly, and polite, and I wanted to give them a good review. I prefer this restaurant to others in the area simply for the customer service. 

I also think the food is pretty good, consistent with other KFC's. I work nearby, so I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The clerk didn't say a word. I just had to start ordering my food because he didn't even greet me. Then the manager was rude and loud talked most customers. The manager also came out in the lobby numerous times and sat on the table and went back cooking with washing his hands. A customer also asked for the corporate number and the manager claimed he didn't know it."}
{"text":"Service is good food was on wonderful. Bathrooms are clean. Angel was pleasant and I didn't even need to ask for a free cookie. I just wish the chicken wasn't quite so expensive"}
{"text":"When I moved to the new house I went to this KFC thinking I would have good service. When I went there for the first time I had very slow service .It took 30 minutes to get my food and they got my order wrong. I tried to call them to let them know they got my order wrong but both of the numbers were wrong. So I called the headquarters of KFC and reported to them and told them what happened to me going there.

So I left for work and came back after a month. I went back there to see if they improved there service. They were on point and got my order right the first time around. I had to see if they did improve or if it was luck. So I went back there two more times to make sure that it wasn't just luck. Yes, their service got a lot better both night and day."}
{"text":"Not sure why all the bad reviews, but I have never had any issues with this KFC. My husband and I have ordered from here multiple times over the past few months and it's always a good experience. Food is cooked properly, order is always correct, friendly staff, and the wait isn't bad. I think this is a good KFC, and we will continue to go here!"}
{"text":"Ordered at drive thru, had to wait until the food was cooked. Great, right? Hot fresh food...except it was overcooked. The potato wedges were more like fries and they were tough as ****. My dog barely ate them."}
{"text":"I previously walked out of this KFC after waiting at the counter without an acknowledgement of any kind for 10 Minutes  I said then that I would not be back.  Tonight my husband had a KFC craving and I caved thinking my previous experience was a one off.  It wasn't.  There were four people in line and I asked if any of them had been helped and they all said no.  Someone from the back told an employee to get up to the front counter and he arrived about 5 mins later.  I could see they were busy and I am okay with that and don't mind the wait but I could also see the drive thru was moving right along.  When I arrived it was empty but while waiting for my order, six orders were processed and delivered.  When placing my order I had been told there was no crispy available so I opted for original however before getting my order for 2x2 pc breast and wing, the gentleman who ordered after me got his bucket of extra crispy.  He had overheard my conversation at the counter and he actually apologized to me as he walked away with his chicken.  I arrived at 5:03pm and left at 5:33.  My receipt has a large blank space in the center so I could not report this direct to KFC as the Survey Code was missing vital numbers in the center.  Obviously I am writing this while still upset but I guarantee I will find another KFC to frequent."}
{"text":"My family went out of our way to find a KFC. That was a mistake. Our 20 piece wings were rubbery. It seemed like they were a couple hours old. The famous bowl was mediocre at best. The only thing that was edible were the potato wedges and they were cold also. One positive thing was that they were quick, but that's probably because our food was sitting around."}
{"text":"You just lost a long time customer.  I've been coming here for a few years always buying tenders. Tonight I was told I couldn't get the tender basket unless I took sauce.  So they charged me double the price for 3 tenders just because I simply wanted plain tenders, something this store has always done before. So why did they rip me off Ttonight?  Was it the store or the creepy little man who waited on me?  Either way obviously customer service and retaining customers is not important to this KFC.  Drive a few more blocks to find another KFC because the one on 37th St & E Thomas is not honest and above board."}
{"text":"Horrific! We are here right now. It's seriously 80+ degrees in here... we let the older lady behind the counter know, assuming maybe they didn't realize, and she looks at us and just says \"it's hotter back here\". We made a couple more comments before ordering, but nothing was done about it. The 2 piece meal was $5.99 for dark meat but you have to add on your $2 drink. The lobby is filthy- had to wipe down my son's highchair before I put him in it. Then our order got messed up. At least they are consistent in poor everything. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I know it is a fast food place, and that it is hard to write a review on fast food.... so here goes!

This was truly one of the most frustrating fast food experiences ever! I decided on KFC as a quick dinner option.... so much for fast food and a quick option! By the time I got my food it was 21 minutes later! My receipt showed I paid at 6:57p- I did not leave the establishment until 7:18p!

I pulled into the drive thru and ordered one famous bowl- with the gravy on the side (so that it wouldn't get to soggy by the time I got home) the girl repeated my order and it was correct, so I proceeded to the window to continue the transaction and receive my food- when I got to the window the girl took my card and then mentioned it would be about six minutes for my food, and I said ok- she then completed the monetary transaction and asked me to pull around to the front to wait and she would bring it out when it was ready- so I did- only to see her leaving for her shift to go home ten minutes later- so I wanted another 5 before going in to check on my order- I was then ignored by three different workers to then be asked by another yelling from the back of the kitchen with an attitude \"can I help you!?\"- I said that I was coming in to get my order and had my receipt- she then proceeded to get the order, and handed it to- I checked the bag, and noticed that the gravy was on the dish- so I mentioned that I had ordered it on the side- she seems a lil annoyed and they went to re-make it.... Another girl brought it back with a very dismissive attitude.

I know that it is a fast food place, but as a fellow human I have never received such bad courtesy from other people!

If you want KFC- I highly recommend another location!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would! Worst customer service at the drive through EVER! After waiting 20 minutes we finally pull up to place our order. I had 3 kids with me so we ordered 4 of the $5 fill up boxes. Not sure if she forgot her headset was on but I hear \"ugh really\"? So I asked if that was a problem then she stumbled through asking if that was all. I got to the window and handed her my card. I asked what my total was and she rolls her eyes at me and sighs like it's killing her to look at my total. The guy behind me was asking if anyone was there and she snapped back at him extremely rude that yes someone was there and that he needed to hang on. Who runs a business like this? This woman obviously hates her job and has no business working in customer service. We won't be back!!!"}
{"text":"How can a chicken facility not have drumsticks?  And then no large cups?  What moron is running this place?!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday, I gotta say my experiences at KFC are never good either the food is wrong or something not the case here. This was my first time at this location and the cashier a young man was very nice, my food was hot and correct, store itself was well maintained I'd come back."}
{"text":"Have you ever tried their BONELESS FIERY BUFFALO WINGS?

One of the self-imposed rules I feel strongly about when I travel : avoid fast food chains or nation-wide franchises unless you've REALLY exhausted all plausible options.

However, this particular KFC Express holds a special place in my heart.

I won't tell you the story of how my travel buddy gambled away most of the money we had set aside for the trip (with minimal help from me, really..... although I stand by the fact that the casino staff conspired against me and rigged the Blackjack machines specifically to watch ME fail) on our first trip to Las Vegas together.

When you're staying at the Wynn, being hungry+broke+tired occasionally leads to you going across the street to the Food Court at Fashion Show Mall.

I discovered something delicious for the first time at KFC that day... something that I later learned would be very difficult to find in California, Texas, Massachusetts, and many other states I visited later that year.... There is only one reason why I will stop at the KFC Express 1 out of 2 trips to Las Vegas:  BONELESS FIERY BUFFALO WINGS."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! Refused to serve us food because my 6 year old left his shirt at home! The main entrance doesn't have any signs posted on the door. Plus she was very rude about it! We will never visit this location again!"}
{"text":"I would've given more stars if anything good had happened on my visit to this KFC. I have to admit, it's been a long time since I've been to any KFC, but I sincerely hope they're not all like this one. 

My first clue should've been that the place was empty, not even a car in the drive-thru. The menu in the drive-thru doesn't reflect all items offered, so we had to ask several questions then finally placed our order. We were told we'd get the total at the window. We never did. We had to ask what the total was after we paid with our credit card. There's a sign on the window that they have a added fee for credit card purchases, but thankfully we didn't see any extra charge...and we did use a credit card.

The chicken was small, mashed potatoes were cold, and the biscuit seemed a little old. So, this was my first and last visit here."}
{"text":"Just went through the drive thru service very poor, to top it off took a bite of my biscuit literally the dough stretched out in the middle. Tried to call to give them notice they might want to check their biscuits before serving them, no answer."}
{"text":"Ordered two 12 piece hot wings, large mashed w/gravy and small coke slaw today at about 1830 hours today from the drive thru.

Got home and no mashed potatoes...  mac and cheese instead, which was not fresh.

About half the wings were semi-fresh.  The other half was dry, hard and stale...  As if it were kept under a heat lamp all day...

This location really needs to get its act together."}
{"text":"EVERY time something goes wrong when i come here. i always get a $5 fill up; which is $5.25 here; they always forget the cookie. the service is usually slow although today i did get out quickly......without my cookie. the chicken has no flavor. but i keep coming back because i cant quit their coleslaw. nobody else can touch that slaw."}
{"text":"Okay so this non KFC fan has been converted due to their hot wings. I just love the fact that they are crispy and juicy.

I have found they key to ensuring fresh, hot delicious ones is ordering a 20 piece. I will always have to wait but it is well worth it in in my book.
 
Even left over, these wings are still crunchy and crispy. I have got to figure out what they put in the batter."}
{"text":"This use to be terrible but they have improved drastically. Fresh chicken, always hot and good. I have not had the bad experiences others have written about."}
{"text":"Was lured by the $5 meal. As it turns out the $5 meal is overpriced by about $4.50. It's not necessary to say much else about this place other than stay away."}
{"text":"Great KFC place in Southwest, Clean and great people! Jeff is the man! We enjoyed the kfc food!"}
{"text":"came in here for lunch at taco bell, as this is a split location, been here quite a few times, the service is lacking at this location, one time when I went to \"review\" my order was correct in the bag, I was asked \"what are you doing, all the food is there\" I responded with \"just checking\" which the cashier responded with \"ok good, check away\" just really odd service/mannerisms, the food seems to be overloaded with cilantro, this location has a lot of parking, a drive thru, a great location, but with substandard service, I wish I could rate it higher, but I can't."}
{"text":"Danielle at the drive thru completely hates her job and it's very transparent when coming into contact with her.. she was very rude, She stuck my food out the window and goes \"here\" and closed the window so quick and I needed my receipt and she was texting on her phone and acted like she couldn't be bothered. Why do people work somewhere they HATE girl go find you a different job , you look miserable."}
{"text":"I don't know why we keep coming here. 

They are almost always out of something we order. Pot pies are pretty much a myth around here. 

Tonight the drive thru was closed with a sign asking folks to come in to order. There are 5 separate parties in here now all waiting for food. Yikes. Going to be a while. 

I feel bad for the employees - it seems like they are trying hard to keep this place afloat. I won't blame them. 

The parking lot is a disaster. Pot holes everywhere! Bummer to see it sinking so badly."}
{"text":"2nd worst KFC that I have been to. Ordered a bucket of Grilled chicken. Had to replace two breast with original recipe. Got two extra biscuits. All the biscuits were undercooked. Not well maintained property. Dirty floor and tables. Nasty bathroom. Will not return."}
{"text":"Horrible! Most of the employees, including some who were apparently off duty, were too busy hanging around chatting with each other to get orders packed correctly, interact with customers in a friendly manner, or clean the disgusting bathrooms and customer seating area.

Edited to add this follow-up: Complained to KFC about the lousy service, wrong food, and disgusting, dirty conditions. Got a standard apology letter with a $5 certificate usable only at the location we told them we'd never go to again. Way to go KFC! Way to listen to your customers. Not that they have to since they're so big, but it makes me question myself every time I get a thought about visiting any of their stores, and I've stopped myself from going there from time to time."}
{"text":"Pull up to the drive through, had to wait for the cashier per his request. Started the order with a #5 combo, which is only a combo. This is only problematic because the cashier seemed to want to rush me by not asking what type of drink I wanted (this will come into play later). I finish my order of a #6 w/ a Dr pepper, a side of Cole slaw(which I don't know what size I even got), and 2 extra biscuits. Next, I pull up to the window after a relatively short wait, which would have been great normally, but there's more to this story. I'm greeted by the cashier that immediately asked me if I had the order with the mt. Dew and Pepsi, although I was the only one in the drive through. I corrected him, he ran my card, gave me my drinks and told me to pull up front to wait, which isn't what frustrated me. When I waited for 5 more minutes outside, I finally got some of my order. I was missing a Cole slaw and the 2 biscuits, so I had to get out and go inside to explain what happened. The girl inside was polite and promptly gave me my missing items. The biggest issue I have is the fact that the cashier double verified with me, and I verified verbally to him the order I got, but apparently that wasn't good enough. I won't even mention the fact that my food wasn't even close to fresh, which makes me wonder why I had to wait in the beginning. Definitely won't be going back, I wouldn't recommend it. I went at ~740-750PM so definitely steer clear around that time.
Edit: When the KFC on 51st and baseline opens up, I'm sure everyone in Laveen will definitely choose it over this one."}
{"text":"KFC just opened recently and i was excited! I tried to grab a quick meal on my way home but came home with nothing. Although they seem to be pleasant, turns out that they don't do credit cards, only debit cards or cash and then they enforce a $.39 fee if you use your debit card. I don't get it! I expect something like this from a small shop but a large chain like KFC??? Very disappointed :("}
{"text":"One of the worst kfc in town. Didn't have a choice because this was close to my house so I come here. 90% of the time they will get your order wrong. Seems like their chicken is getting smaller and smaller every time. I'll just probably drive to next kfc maybe worth the extra few miles than coming to this dump."}
{"text":"The food isnt that bad i always get the 3 piece tender 5 dollar fill up that is almost 6$ now but ok whatever right? This location and i think also the one on 75th and thunderbird have been out of ranch for months. UNACCEPTABLE!!!"}
{"text":"Do not go to this KFC this is the third time we tried this place and will be the last. Every time we go there out of chicken. They are very slow and never say sorry. Last night we pick the food up the sides look like they were three day old we could not eat just tossed them  oh ya and did not again have any grilled chicken   Between bad management and a owner that has no clue it is always bad. Plus my wife was sick all night from the chicken.  If I could do zero stars I would."}
{"text":"We went to the KFC on Chandler Blvd. & the I-101 to get the 8 piece Family meal $19.99 + .99 (10 piece tender bites on special) for our visit to my 96 yr. old mother in law on Sunday.
She loves KFC! 
I was quite disappointed in the price to quantity ratio. All 8 pieces of chicken fit in the same size box as the 4 piece biscuit box. The 3 chicken legs and 2 thighs looked the same size as wing drumettes. The 2 wings would not keep a sparrow aloft. The breast, although a little larger, was dry. The 10 piece Tender bites were also dry and the crust had come off in the cooking process. The sides were ok. Cole slaw, 4 dry biscuits, potatoes and gravy. I could have consumed all the chicken myself and still have room for sides and dessert and I'm not a heavy eater. 
I have visited many KFC's and they are all the same. It's not just this location. 
Absolutely NOT worth the $21.00+tax for me but worth every penny for the smile on my mother in law's face! :-)"}
{"text":"I love the flavor of original KFC chicken!
However, the size of the chicken varies from each location. Sometimes they are huge like a turkey and sometimes like a sparrow. It's a luck of the draw. More often than not. Wish they'd change their recipe for biscuits too, they are so dry and flavorless! Church's have the best biscuits.
I sometimes get the chicken at KFC then go to Church's for the biscuits. Pain in the a$$."}
{"text":"We went to the KFC located at Hayden and Indian School about 2pm on a Sunday and boy o boy what a big time disappointment! The order taker was so anxious to take our order that she would not allow us to peruse the menu on the wall behind her even though we stood a good 15 feet from her. She kept rambling about the specials and was very distracting and annoying. After some deliberation we decided on the $5 fill up (3 piece tenders, mashed potatoes and biscuit) and  a $8 (3 piece dinner, 3 thighs original recipe) which came with a tiny mashed potatoes and gravy, small cole slaw and a dry biscuit. 
Definition of a chicken is an adult bird over 1 year old..definition of a pullet is under 1 year old and a chick is 6 months or less. The thighs were from a chick. I could put all 3 thighs in the palm of my hand and still see my fingers. After removing the bones there was 3 bites of chicken. I almost felt guilty eating a chick not to mention everything was cold! Dam what a waste of $15! I hope this is not typical of all KFC's. 
Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"For a fast food place, I feel like the people here actually care. They're one of the nicest around.

I came in towards closing and they were able to hook me up when I had a craving.

Thank you."}
{"text":"It's your standard fat food fare. Nothing great about it besides something quick to satisfy the hunger. Free chicken today courtesy of Oprah."}
{"text":"Food was stale like it had been sitting under a hot lamp all day. My Mountain Dew tasted awful. Ordered a bunch of food and asked for 1 BBQ sauce and 1 ranch was told I could only get 1 sauce and would have to pay 27 cents for another one problem was I had already paid and only had my credit card on me. So I only got one sauce, which was no where near enough for the amount of food I got. I will never in my life go back for that reason alone."}
{"text":"I hope your owner is not standing around scratching his head wondering why this business isn't busy. Here's the reality of this place...the biscuit is burnt and is as hard as a rock, the employees do not put butter or honey in the bag for the biscuit, the employees do not ask nor give you any sauce when you order chicken strips, when ordering chicken strips one tiny chicken strip and a handful of popcorn chicken is given, the chicken taste like a stale sponge, and the soda machine pours out funny flavored almost dirty tasting Sierra mist. Reality is the employees do not care just like the management and apparently the owner of this establishment. I normally do not eat fast food and just wanted something quick randomly so I didn't have to sit at a restaurant or cook dinner. Let's just say I ended up cooking dinner anyway because the food was unpalatable and edible. What a shame!"}
{"text":"This is a horrible place, after waiting 40 minutes for wings, Am not coming back ever. Costumer services sucks big time. How can you go to a chicken place and ask for chicken to be told we don't have chicken  ok.. Can I get the little chicken sandwich, it will be 10 minutes , so let's try the wings, 15 minutes.... what the hell to you have and why are you open????"}
{"text":"For some reason I guess you have to give at least one star for the review, even though they don't deserve it. I've gone to this location every Thursday since I moved to the area, and I've been able to get A biscuit substitution because I don't do biscuits, on the their combos. But I went this evening, to get the same substitution that I normally do, and they told me they never do that. I explained to her I do it every Thursday, and she said sorry they don't. I left the drive-through and called the location to talk to the manager. The manager got on the phone and I explained my situation, and she says that they don't ever do that. I explained that I do it pretty much every Thursday and she pretty much called me a liar, saying that she instructs her crew to never do that. She was very rude, short with me in, and hung up on me. I will never go to this location again and I hope this gets around. I am a business owner, and if I had an employee with that attitude, she would no longer be an employee of mine."}
{"text":"Basic KFC with a basic drive thru. Service was standard and food was standard as well. Nothing particularly notable about this location and I have no problem stopping by when I'm in the neighborhood next time I'm in the mood for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Showed up ten minutes before close, I work at a restaurant so I know how shitty that is of me but we wanted chicken! They served us properly and even gave us a free drink as we had to wait for our biscuits to cook. Food was good quality and staff was great."}
{"text":"This KFC has the worst mac and cheese I have ever had in my life, the pasta was over cooked and mushy and the cheese was all watery, it was almost like a soup... very disappointed."}
{"text":"I'd give no stars if I could. 
KFC's food will always be bomb so we already know this isn't a complaint about the food. 
Whomever is the franchise owner I hope they see this. Cashier we had was great, he was friendly, good at multitasking (he helped me get to the bathroom while my husband and kids was ordering) by the time I came back my husband was pissed off and everyone else seemed like they were walking on eggs. OKAY? Why? Found out that the manager there had lost his mind because he acted like he had no manager experience. It's upsetting to hear that a manager would speak to his employee in a demeaning way. Apparently my husband had given a 100 bill and they had no change. Upon request from the cashier to manager he had said \"WE DONT HAVE FUCKING CHANGE FOR A 100 I DONT KNOW WHY YOU FUCKING TOOK THAT FROM HIM\" 

How rude can you be? Seriously? Where did you get your managing experience from? 

I will never support a business, that has no respect for their employees. And that darn manager had no gloves! And he was working with food!!!"}
{"text":"This KFC is hands down the worst. They never have enough chicken cooked to fill an order without a substantial (25-45 minute) wait which I think is total bull. If you sell chicken you should make enough to fill say....a bucket of chicken. The drivethrough is a joke - it takes forever and you are probably going to drive off with only half your order. Case in point - last month I ordered a 16 piece bucket 'o' chicken for a party. I get home and find that my 16 piece bucket is in fact a 12 piece bucket , the pieces were teensy and there was a random bonus piece of yellow plastic included. So I check my receipt and call the manager to request his assistance on the matter. He tells me that chicken shrinks in the winter which is why my pieces are so small. Now I am no scientist and maybe this is true but it sounds pretty damn stupid to me. He offers me to give me the missing 4 pieces of chicken if I drive back there (keep in mind both Thunderbird and 75th ave are torn up with construction and this is rush hour on a Friday). I told him fine and that I would rather get a refund then the 4 pieces at this point because I was disgusted with his attitude. He states \"Ok but you will have to return MY chicken\". Seriously? Like I am trying to get one over on KFC after they shortchanged me on my $30 bucket of chicken? OK guy. You can keep your measly chicken - I will go to Fry's."}
{"text":"I am not digging on the chain but this KFC specifically is terrible. Like I am so confident I will again be served terribly, since it is the only consistent thing this place is known for, that I'm writing it ahead of time. They well screw up your order as a gimme, but the real thing they do well is have no forsight to prep popular items or unpopular items like grilled chicken, and they will do it by 11am. Not at right before closing time, not one time when the chef forgot, but constantly. They won't say for instance, if all they have is crispy, they won't tell you there is a wait for original. They just don't plan on making any anytime soon.  I think it is just laziness and poor management. I don't have another close option since the 24th one closed so I am headed there and I know it will not disappoint at being disappointing."}
{"text":"These employees are so rude. I've been a total of 3 times and I will never return again. The employees are make the customer feel like you are inconveniencing them. I was in the drive thru and I ordered my food. The employee asked if I wanted anything else and I told him the second order. He had the nerve to huff and said oh my god under his breath. This is not the first time I've been treated with disrespect here."}
{"text":"I want here waited 30 minutes. There were four or five employees are hanging out or not even on the clock nobody is doing their job. 30 minutes later ass for my food and they told me I had only been waiting three minutes and I've have to ring to get a refund never even got any food this place sucks balls"}
{"text":"They refused to make a double down even though they have chicken, cheese and bacon. What terrible service. Just go to Chick-fil-a next door."}
{"text":"Location: it is very convenient to get here. It is located right off Chandler and the 101 freeway and only 5 minutes away from the Chandler mall. However, the restaurant is relatively dirty. I literally have to use napkins to clean our booths before we could sit down on it. 

Service: cashier is friendly and patience with everyone. However, you cannot use debit card for purchases. You have to use a credit card (which is BS if you ask me). I feel bad for the cashier who delivers this message to customers. I truly hope they will consider changing this ridiculous policy soon. 

Food: I ordered 2 pieces of white meat chicken and my two size are claw slaw and mashed potatoes. The chicken is very tasty and claw slaw is delicious. Mashed potatoes were just \"OK\". 

Rating: I don't mind ordering food from here \"to go\" but will never sit in at this restaurant again. During the meantime, I will search for another KFC close by"}
{"text":"The chicken was great but we had ordered 2 meals one of which had mashed potatoes and gravy and slaw the other was supposed to have mashed potatoes but when we managed to drive all the way home we realized it had not been included.  

Nothing worse than getting home to discover part of your meal missing during one of the busiest times of the day traffic wise.

I called and they were very helpful in correcting the issue issuing a store credit for the value however a credit for next time isn't the same as the correct food on the date of service initially."}
{"text":"I just sat in this drive-thru for 15 minutes, and nobody took my order. Drove to Culver's instead. This place is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Please please please do not go to this location these people are 1 dirty 2 very very rude and 3 bad service.But most importantly they never use gloves or tongues  to grab your chicken.I ordered a bucket the lady dropped my bucket with my chicken in it  and she thought I wasn't looking so she picked it up and put it back in my bucket. last but not least she was eating a wing while putting my order that's why she dropped my food and started to argue with me saying I'm lying when I asked for a refund she said to me get out you Chinese asshole and let me quote I'm not Chinese I'm African that's how stupid they are so please don't eat here there just rude and racist. One more thing as I was ordering I noticed the same employee smoking outside and as I walked in I noticed she didn't wash her hands and was like I said not wearing gloves and was touching all the food so please lady's and gentlemen stay away from this location.
Or you will be tasting smoke or dirty floor"}
{"text":"The worst KFC in Phoenix!  They are super slow I was in the drive through for 15 minutes! And that was just to get to the window.  Another 8 minutes to get my food! Staff was nice but this place is severely understaffed!  I'll drive 2 miles farther to the next one..  I'll probably get back home faster!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I visited this KFC, or any KFC.  I saw the TV ad featuring Reba McEntire (love her) for a new smokey BBQ chicken.  Got an ad in the mail this week so thought I would give it a try.  I took the ad in and asked for the 9 piece bucket for $10.99 (It's not a meal, just chicken).  I asked for the smokey bbq and the cashier said that was not available for this price. Closest he could do was an 8 piece bucket of smokey bbq for $17.99. WHAT!!  So I thought this must be some special chicken and I ordered it. I watched hime go in the back room and put some chicken in a container and squirt bbq sauce all over it, then top it with a few paper thin pickle slices. I asked him if that was the only difference, squirting bbq sauce on it? He said \"Ya, a little deceptive, I know\".  WOW!! Came to just under $20 with tax and when I got home, there were only 7 pieces in the container. The taste was ok, a little dry.  Definitely not a Wow, I must have this again!! Lesson learned and I will not be returning. : - ("}
{"text":"Slow service. I'm also disappointed that my chicken little was not the Nashville Hot."}
{"text":"Worst KFC ever don't go here! Awful customer service. We went to the drive thru and the employee acted like she didn't know the menu. Rude we had to repeat our order 3 times we decided to leave"}
