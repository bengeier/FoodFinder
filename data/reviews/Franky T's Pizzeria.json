{"text":"Just tried Sal's for the first time and I am incredibly disappointed. First of all, they do not have a brick oven, they use a conveyor therefore it comes out quite similar to a Dominos pizza. The sauce had a decent flavor, but there was SO MUCH. Luckily I got jalape√±os on my pizza so that helped a bit with the taste. I also got pepperonis and ham, and on my entire 10\" pizza there were only 8 pepperonis (2 per slice) and to me that seems pretty skimpy. There was even less ham. So overall, decent crust, way too much sauce, and not nearly enough toppings. You can save yourself some money and get pizza from a franchise place, it will taste the same (if not a little better)."}
{"text":"Tried this place out based on reviews that indicated they served authentic NY style pizza. It was OK, but not true NY style. A \"real\" pizza joint has to have a traditional pizza oven, not a conveyor belt pizza maker like you find at Little Caesar's or Dominoes. It's probably a little better than those places. If your near Concord or Lake Norman, there are much better choices. The very best is Prosciutto's of of exit 28 on 77. Hawthorne's and Due Amici's are also very good. (Hawthorne's has the best garlic knots.)"}
{"text":"Garlic calzone was pure deliciousness! Great food friendly staff. Worth the drive and no wait!"}
{"text":"We visited Sal's Pizzeria on the way back from the mountains last weekend. What a total disappointment! This is not NY pizza and the sauce has very little flavor. We ordered their two pizza special and the garlic bread with cheese. The garlic bread was the only good thing about our dinner. The restaurant needs a good cleaning. The owner and the girl working behind the counter were very nice but that would not be cause for us to go back and spend anymore money here."}
{"text":"Came to NC from Louisiana, heard great things about this little place and REALLY enjoyed it. So much food, plenty enough to share! Sal's Favorite Pizza is fabulous! Very nice, friendly people working there and would defiantly recommend it to anyone passing through!!!"}
{"text":"Philly Cheese Steak - 5/5 - Very good. The Bread was original and awesome.  The meat and toppings were cooked to perfection.  It could of used a little more meat, but that's mainly because the sandwich was giant.  Cheese Pizza - 3/5 - The dough/crust was great and the sauce was decent, but the cheese was below par.  I think they need a better connection on mozzarella.  It had a lot of funk and not much flavor.  Perhaps it was a bad batch, but judging from their prices, they are probably using the cheap stuff.  I will be back for another sub.  I highly recommend the philly cheese steak.  The pizza is probably better with toppings, but I always like to first judge a pizza place by their cheese pizza.  The owner is friendly and seems like a genuinely good guy.  The prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the area is Sal's New York pizza. Whenever I'm in the area I have to stop in for a pizza....yes, an entire pizza.   I'm pretty sure the owner is Sal and he is always in there and will recommend the best item for what you are in the mood for. I've had most of the pizza and cheese garlic knots which are some of the best I've ever had.   What I love even more about this place is how passionate the owner is about his food. He is always trying new item so the menu is updated quite a bit.   The service is always great as well. I've never waited more than a few minutes to get a piping hot pizza.   Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"The prices are cheap and the food is wicked awesome. The Italian sausage calzones, cheesesteak subs and pizzas are amazing. We NEVER got a bad order from Sals."}
{"text":"I've lived in New York for 28 years and bounced around 6 different states looking for real New York Style pizza.  And Sal's is the only place that makes real New York pizza. Every thing on the menu is amazing and the staff and owner are very cool people. You go there once and your treated like family"}
{"text":"Haven't been to ny to eat pizza. Not sure what the differences are between locales. I do know when pizza is good and I know this pizza is good. Thin crispy crust. Cheese was properly portioned. Sauce is nice and the staff was just as nice during my lunch trip. 2 pepperoni slices for $5."}
{"text":"Hands down best subs ever especially the new Chili Claw dog and Thomas Philly on Steroids. Pizza is awesome, the pasta is great, prices are perfect and above all the people that work there are super nice and just down to earth great people. If you haven't tried it then definitely stop by and I promise you will be back....."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to grab a cheese steak sub! Really haven't had anything that wasn't good there!"}
{"text":"Went in and spoke to the owners and these guys get it. I told them about my first experience and they both apologized and went way beyond apologizing. So I am not saying you will get perfect food every time you eat here but they will definitely make it right and that is all that really matters. So if you're looking for a good guy to support in a local pizza restaurant spend your money here"}
{"text":"I don't know what \"real\" NY pizza is and I don't care! Sal's pizzas are great!  I have several friends who swear by his calzones. My all time favorite here though is the Philly Cheese Steak!  He bakes his bread fresh, and the cheese is gloriously melted and mixed with the meat and peppers & onions!  I keep meaning to try other items on the menu but it's really hard because this sandwich keeps calling my name whenever I walk in the door! There is a \"hotter\" version on the menu--I tried it once and went back to the original.  Sal goes kind of crazy with garlic sometimes. That being said, the garlic knots with dipping sauce are great.  Skip the wings; too much breading and I don't think he's making them fresh like he is with his bread products.  Please note this is NOT a sit-down type of restaurant.  It is very tine and is in a blue collar Food Lion shopping center on N. New Hope Rd in Gastonia.  Sal's has only 2 tables, that seat a total of 7, and then he has about 4-5 bar stools at a counter in the corner.  It is very much a Takeout place though I have eaten lunch there several times.  He is closed on Sundays and does not deliver though he prints the number of some delivery service on his menu. I don't know what their minimum dollar order is in order to utilize the delivery service.    As for all the noise about the type of oven who cares?!!!!!!!!  He is obviously a start-up entrepreneur and his food is good!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch after working for 12 hours since my last meal. Got the very affordable lunch special and it was by far the best pizza I have had in months. And I'm not sure if the staff were owner/operators or employees but they were incredibly friendly."}
{"text":"I visited Sal's because of what I read here: \"it's true NY style\" or \"it's nothing like a NY slice.'    Total contradiction, although both are true.  Let me explain: in form, the pie looks a lot like a domino's pizza; it's fairly small (compared to a NYC pie).  The crust was what you'd find in a pizzeria in the suburbs of NYC: tasty, chewy (though not in a bad way), and gummy (again, not in a bad way).  In visual presentation it looked like a domino's pie.  Ingredients on our cheese pie (sauce, dough, and cheese) were good.  I can't vouch for the toppings, but it's evident that Sal doesn't chintz on the quality of the aforementioned items.  Why isn't this a true NYC pie?  For one, a true NYC pie is a full 18\" in diameter.  Second, a true NYC slice has a seared, well done, crust (on the outside), while somewhat gummy on the inside, such that a ginormous slice can be easily folded for eating.  And...if you're lucky, a true NYC slice will run a little heavy on the cheese.  Sal's puts out good, solid, offerings.  But his pizza is made for this market (Gaston), not NYC."}
{"text":"Kids love there pizza wife loves the meatballs and pasta it's our go to pizza joint  There margarita pizza out of this world meatball sub can't be beat there's never any leftovers or we order from Frankie T's"}
{"text":"My favorite Pizza place here. Subs are awesome with homemade bread. Not too many NY Style Pizza places here are that good and I just moved here 2 years ago. This place taste like home to me. I tried Simonetti's but it wasn't that good. I get take out here at least once a week. Prices also seem to be the lowest which is another reason why I prefer Sal's."}
{"text":"And the once great standard for pizza has become mediocre. Ordered my usual chicken and bacon, Sal's favorite and a calzone. The topping level was down significantly, packaging for the calzone was different and the entire staff was new with no Sal to be seen. Not sure if it's his week off or it something else, but it's not the same. Crust is tougher with less toppings and a little bit steeper price.   Hoping Sal was just on vacation. I miss him."}
{"text":"I had never been before and based off the Yelp reviews wanted to try it. I had envisioned a small Italian style restaurant where we (wife, daughter & myself) could sit down and have pizza - that is definitely not the case, there is very little seating and it's an extremely cramped lobby. Plan on taking your items to go.  That small disappointment aside the pizza was very good. We ordered a small cheese and a large margherita pizza with garlic knots.  As people have said previously the crust is simply outstanding they have a good sauce for the cheese/classic pizzas and the ingredients were dispersed well on the margherita pizza. It's so good that I'm looking forward to trying other items on the menu even though it's not very close at all to my home. If you like thin crust pizza (whether or not you believe it is truly NY style) you won't be disappointed in giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Pizza was good. Had a lot of cheese so was kinda greasy but that dough was fantastic crispy and chewy. The garlic knots are amazing with and without mozzarella cheese topping - perfect amount of garlic and herbs! Definitely will come back to try some sandwiches. Sorry no pic of garlic knots ate them too fast!!!"}
{"text":"My grandmother lived in California for 40+ years and said \"This is the best pizza I've had since I've moved here\" which was 12 years ago. I definitely give it two thumbs up (if I had more thumbs, they would be up as well)! We got the House Special in medium and it was absolutely delicious. Lots of toppings and different flavors made me smile. The marinara sauce is like the hug you've needed all day! The 100 sanitation rating and all of the ServSafe certifications are just bonuses!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were wanting to try someplace new for lunch today so we headed to Sal's. We're SO glad we did! The pizza by the slice is a great deal and the garlic knots were absolutely mouth-watering! We were greeted cheerfully and the employees were so friendly and helpful. The food came out in good time and piping hot. It's difficult to find pizza that has a crispy yet perfectly chewy crust (in a really good way) and it was heaven from first bite!  The garlic knots were delicious and were gone before we knew it... ooops! It's a tiny place but that's definitely part of its charm and was very clean.  This was our first time here but we will definitely be back. It's worth the 35 minute drive from Shelby."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say these people can make some awesome pizza! I had a pepperoni slice both times I came but my friend had a calzone and I tasted it so good! My mouths watering talking about it! Best pizza place around here! It's small place to eat but big on flavor! Perfection and I'm pretty picky! :)"}
{"text":"This is not, let me repeat, NOT New York style pizza.  The dough it too think and over worked, but still pretty good dough.  It has the right chewy quality and a nice flavor. Unfortunately, some of the topings could be better.  I ordered a pie with pepperoni, sausage and beef..all off which would have been better quality. The beef is actually pretty gross..a crumbled, over-cooked and poorly seasoned mess that reminded me of dog food.   Plus, they use a conveyor oven, not a brick wood burning oven or even a deck pizza oven!  I'd say the most authentic New York aspect of Sal's is the staff. When I made a special request, I over-heard the guy (who I can only assume is the manager or owner) telling the pizza cook to ignore my request, because I'm one of those customers who \"doesn't know what he's talking about.\"   Overall, the pizza wasn't bad, but not worth the price.  I think you would be just as satisfied with a $10 Dominoes or Pizza Hut pizza."}
{"text":"First time eating from here tonite.  Sal's favorite 12\" medium.   totally awesome.  Better than Papa John's by a landslide.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I got a pizza from here during a recent visit to North Carolina and I really enjoyed it. It was better then you would get from any chain pizza restaurant. A great pizza place to stop in and get a slice or more."}
{"text":"Great food everytime wrbhave ate here. We have food delivered and delivery is excellent. Driver ( Kyle ) is excellent and VERY CURTIOUS. The owner actually delivered tonight and is the same way. Thanks for great food and service ."}
{"text":"Sal's never disappoints.  The pizza is great and made with fresh ingredients.  Sal is a great guy and always makes you feel appreciated.  Try the Stromboli it is excellent."}
{"text":"So we're new to town... well the whole state... and we were on our way home and saw the good reviews on Yelp and thought hmm were hungry and wanted pizza sooo let's stop at this Sal's place and check it out.   Good thing we did because yesssss this pizza is my new fave. We live in the middle of nowhere and this place was a blessing. Eric was so super nice and told us all about the menu and the pizza and helped us out. He made an awesome pie. I cannot wait to order from there again and try more menu items. Garlic knots are very authentic tasting. Pizza was just yummy and cheesy! They just got themselves a regular and I'll be telling everyone I know in town."}
{"text":"Great place for spaghetti, subs and of course their pizzas are wonderful. Very nice and friendly folks."}
{"text":"Very good New York style pizza.  Subs and pasta dishes are great too and the prices are nice for really good, tasty pizza."}
{"text":"I honestly miss living around the corner from Sals! hands down one of the best pizza places in Gaston County. We don't eat here much anymore because we moved out of town but it is truly missed. Go try a pie and say hi to Sal, he's a really laid back guy and was always very nice to my wife and I"}
{"text":"Ben Wyatt would love the calzones here... literally   Also the cheesy bread is awesome  But the calzones were really really good."}
{"text":"Nooooooooo. This is the old Sal's and the food has taken such a turn. The food is probably mediocre, but what is horrible is that the employees take turns sitting right outside the OPEN door smoking. I couldn't get over being choked by cigarette smoke long enough to give the food a fair chance but we will NOT be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza. That's coming from a pizza snob from NY too. Will be trying more often."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Good salad with house Italian dressing. Cheesesteak was good but Mad Italian beats it. Would have liked to try Italian sub. Very nice folks there. Worth the stop on the way from Atlanta to Durham."}
{"text":"My husband, our 4 year old son, and I visited Sal's yesterday while passing through the area.  I'm so glad we chose this place for lunch.  The food & service was perfect.  The shop itself doesn't look like much, but that's how it is with some of the best places to eat.  My husband ordered a sausage Stromboli, I got baked spaghetti, & our little guy had his eye on a slice of cheese pizza.  As with any proper NY pizza, the slices were as big as your head, so the very helpful & considered young lady at the counter offered to cut it down the middle for him.  My husband, meanwhile, was completely lost in the joy of his Stromboli.  It was large enough that he brought half home for dinner.  My spaghetti, which came with an order of garlic knots, was delicious! The sauce tasted like homemade.    You really can't beat the prices of their lunch specials.    If we are ever in Gastonia again we will definitely be stopping in."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. Hands down. Get the garlic knots \"all the way\" they are amazing as well!"}
