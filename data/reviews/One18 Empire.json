{"text":"Delicious breakfast. Pancakes and their specialty bacon, smoked thick pieces of pork drizzled with maple syryp. Like meat candy. The service was great and friendly."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Prices are great for the quality food you receive. Needing a sociable spot to grab a fancy drink and an appetizer this is the spot. Meals I would suggest the burgers hamburger or chicken, both are full of portions and flavour. Oh and grab a old fashion they do a great display with a smoked barrel."}
{"text":"A great spot for cocktails and light bites, whether as a couple or hosting an event (we've been here for both). We think they have the best Old Fashioned in the city. The small plates range from delicious fresh pretzel bread to house made charcuterie and pickles (which adorn the walls) to seared duck breast and potato tapas. Pretty much everything we've had had been a hit. I'm going to assume the main courses are of similar caliber but we'll have to try them and report back with an update.  The professionalism and genuine friendliness of the staff is also noteworthy. We've had drinks comped because they took too long to come out, and have gotten history lessons about the area on other occasions. The lighting is low and many of the seats plush, giving One18 Empire a relaxed lounge atmosphere even when it's busy such as during happy hour."}
{"text":"The service, atmosphere and food is amazing here. This restaurant is perfect for a night out, business lunch or just hanging out with friends. I had the smokes chicken sandwich with kale Cesar salad and it was delicious. The dressing is made with lemon preserve and it was spectacular. Everything is made I house so it is fresh and devine. The smoked chicken came on a pretzel bun and I wanted to take a bag of them home! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This was stop #3 for my Calgary Taco Fiesta rounds. First off, due to it's location, street parking during work hours can be a challenge.  Once I found parking, I walked in and seated myself. The few servers that I interacted with during my visit were very pleasant and went over and above to accommodate my special requests. Right after I placed my order, I got an important phone call which meant I had to leave. I asked for the order to be packed to-go and they obliged.  I had a taco - Crispy fried cod, shredded cabbage slaw, mango-papaya salsa on flour tortillas. The mango-papaya salsa was exquisite. A very perfect accompaniment to the taco. The cod was well battered but I did find it lacking in salt.   I wish my first experience with One18 Empire wasn't so rushed. I fully intend to come back and try them out for lunch because I like what I've seen so far of their food and service."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon One18 after a hockey game, and am so pleased that we did! Service was fantastic - friendly, timely, and entirely adorable. Great atmosphere. The burger was delicious. I wish I were local, because I would definitely go back.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place is just awesome and a mandatory stop whenever I find myself in Calgary. The drinks are delicious and the preparation show by the bartenders is nearly as fun as the drinks themselves!  Ever seen an Old Fashioned made with a blow torch?  You really should.   I've not tried the food other than the bar snacks but if they're any indication, you just can't go wrong."}
{"text":"We were there for pre concert meal. We chose from the 'shareabbles' and all 3  were well prepared, well presented.We had the mussels in fennel and caramelised onions and grilled focaccia; the pan seared scallops on pork jowel and polenta; and deboned short ribs in Yorkshire pud with pancetta and fresh mint. They were rich/ filling and excellent. The wine list for reds is too light but could be excused since it is a whisky bar The service was excellent since we asked for sequencing and this was well fulfilled as was wine pouring A very good downtown option"}
{"text":"Faboulous burger! And the best part? Sit at the bar over lunch hour, order + eat + pay for a burger in 30 minutes and you get it for $10. Beware - the french fries and salads cost you extra (we weren't made aware of this fact until we got our bill, otherwise it would be 5 stars)  I have also been here for happy hour on Mondays when wings + Old Fashioned's are half price - fabulous deal! Try the honey hot wings, not advertised but amazing!"}
{"text":"Went here over another place because it was open a little earlier that morning. Glad I did. Nice modern atmosphere clean as well. Wait staff were friendly and pretty fast. Coffee came in a carafe so it was always a quick top up. I ordered the Chicken and Waffles good butter on top and with a spicy surprise to me was the chili flakes. The cherry on top was after I paid the server asked if I wanted to take a coffee to go."}
{"text":"Having been here for a couple of events (mainly for drinks), I've never actually sat down and had a meal here.   Lunch was the perfect opportunity for me do just that.  The special of the day was cajun shrimp & grits and I really had my heart set on the bacon wrapped meatloaf. WHAT DO I DO?! Thankfully my coworker (who never shares food!) said he'd get the meatloaf and I could try it. (Yes, I did count my blessings that day lol)  Our server chatted with us about their happy hour specials that they have going on and we were quite intrigued. I've seen a lot of other Yelpers talk about the HH here but have never gone myself. Maybe I'll have to tag along one of these days :)  No regrets on going with my shrimp decision. Bacon crumble and shrimp on a bed of hearty grits - so yummy! And the sample of bacon wrapped meatloaf was enough to make sure I'd come back again to get an order to myself!   I'll be back and see you soon! (That's me, talking to the meatloaf lol)"}
{"text":"I like hotels, and I like bars. But somehow I don't usually get too excited by hotel bars. I like a lot of things about this particular hotel bar. Firstly, it's within the Marriott hotel and while it does have a little bit of a hotel bar feel to it, it also feels a bit like a lounge bar. They have a variety of seating, I particularly like the couch section by the windows. Secondly, while you can access it through the lobby, it has a separate entrance on Centre Street as well.   The things I really like are their food menu and their happy hour. They have a good range of food items that range from $2 (yes, they actually have a couple of items that are $2 and $3! I particularly recommend the spiced nuts) up to $35. A lot of these fall within the $8-$15 mark as well. One of my favourites is the pretzel for $8, which has a generous sized fresh pretzel, mustard and cheese. Happy hour is from 3:30pm - 6pm on weekdays and includes local pints for $5 and draft glasses of wine for $6 with other rotating drink specials (I have my eye on Mondays and Tuesdays for half priced cocktails!). Given that the local pints are around $9 (!) happy hour makes for a good deal.  One comment is that the service has been a bit hit and miss. The first time we had the most lovely server, who was so friendly and attentive (if she mentions she's from Vancouver it might be her!). The second time, the service was pretty average - or below average - and the place was almost empty. At one point we weren't seen for over 30 minutes and missed the end of happy hour by five minutes as a result which didn't go down too well.  They also have wifi and several tables set up right next to powerpoints if you need to charge your phone or work on your laptop (but you should probably just be enjoying the happy hour!)."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and overall I've liked this restaurant a lot! Aside from their great mini cocktail and whiskey workshops I've had dinner here a few times. Service has always been impeccable with really friendly and kind staff!  Food:  The scallops have always been great! Sweet and perfectly cooked.   The steak is less consistent! Sometimes amazing, sometimes just meh.   The Calamari is unconventional but super good! It's not fried but grilled and in larger sections (I posted a pic) really well prepared though!   Deseret is a also hit or miss, if you love dense cake it's really good otherwise I always recommend sharing their desserts!   Drinks: The whiskey selection is why you should go!! They have happy hour specials that change daily (look on their website!) sometime there are 50% off certain whiskeys (really great deal!)  Overall:  highly recommend going plus try their vast whiskey selection!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I have been for both lunch and dinner and both have been great. Not a fan of whiskey so their cocktail list doesn't entice me too much."}
{"text":"Order the Scallops, hands down amazing so are their fries.  Service is friendly, they are also knowledgeable in regards to their whiskey and bourbon options which is nice to see.  I am a snob and a connoisseur when it comes to bourbon, whiskey and scotch, it is nice to see that they have knowledge of the process and history when asked.  Not to mention flavor profiles."}
{"text":"If your going for drinks, this is one awesome place to create your own old fashioned... Wine is ok, but they have some on tap where you select the size of your drink. If your just going for food, it was only just ok. The salmon was so-so, but the scallops were pretty good. The rest of my group agreed it was 'just ok'. Wouldn't rush to eat here again."}
{"text":"Had our anniversary dinner here, showed up a little early for our reservation time and was seated right away. Beautiful modern/rustic setting. We tried quite a few things to share as: pretzel, Caesar salad, duck wings, short ribs and a charcuterie board; everything was so unique and outstanding! The drinks and service were wonderful and Connie our waitress was very friendly and professional. This was one of the best meals we've ever had, we can't wait to return and try more. Thank you one18 for a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"The boy suggested this place and I must say, I was quite impressed. We arrived later on a Saturday and sat at the bar for a few cocktails.   I ordered my usual French 75 and he got his (old fashioned) both were made to our liking. The staff weren't overly friendly but seemed quite busy behind the bar.   The vibe and atmosphere was cool and I enjoyed it here. Would come again for cocktails if the opportunity was there."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The duck was incredibly delicious, and the cheesecake was one of the best I've ever had. The service was outstanding, I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great location, wonderful staff, and GREAT whiskey and rye selection! The food was good and the speciality hand crafted drinks were great. Enjoyed a couple old fashions with different Ryes both very good. Had the opertunity to enjoy the express lunch, the soup was great, found that entree to lack flavor. All in all, I would be back."}
{"text":"Had Mother's Day brunch here just last week (we celebrated early on the Saturday rather than Sunday). We were there around 11am and it was surprisingly quiet, which made for a very nice experience. My hubby had been here previously for a work event and felt that the private room was very well set up for groups. Coincidentally, we were seated in the private room again for brunch, I think because of how quiet it was. No complaints here ;)!  Food was delicious and service was great. The beef cheeks won for favourite dish amongst the group. My fried chicken sandwich had a little too much breading and perhaps not enough chicken as per my liking, but overall we were impressed. We did take a look at the breakfast buffet options, but didn't find it particularly enticing (for $24).   We'll be back for dinner!"}
{"text":"We are staying at the hotel and for us, eating on site is usually just a matter of convenience. Today was no exception. We stopped in this afternoon for a light lunch before deciding on where to go for dinner.   We split the BLT and both had the tomato bisque. Having the sandwich and cup of soup served in a small wood cheese board made eating a touch awkward at least for me. That said, the sandwich was very very good. Focaccia was perfectly fresh and soft, soaked up the aioli and flavor from the bacon and salami. Just fantastic! The soup was really good as well if only just a touch toward the cool side. Would absolutely do both again.   Service was the standout here for us though. Our server was just friendly and inviting from start to finish as were all employees we had contact with.  Whomever they have running the show is doing something very right. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Really glad to finally have an opportunity to experience One18 Empire. Got to come for a quick drink as part of a Yelp Elite Event. Had no idea that their space could be divided into separate rooms for event spaces - such a great idea in a restaurant without having to be sent to a weird back room with low lighting! This would be a great space to have a party or event. It is a hotel bar but more like a lounge bar than hotel vibe.  We got to their old fashioned or a gin sour - both were delicious. Love that the glass for the old fashioned gets smoked before the drink is added, and comes with a giant round ice cube. Little details make all the difference. Really appreciated that our server took the time to explain some of the history behind the location and how they got their name, very informative and a nice touch.  Unfortunately I didn't get to try any of the food but a buch of options looked great. Know they have a week day lunch special of \"Pick two for $15\" and there are some great options there.   They have daily happy hour from 4pm to 7pm which means that you dont need to run there for 5pm to try get one drink before happy hour is up. Like cocktail time for adults! Proces at happy hour are 6oz wine on tap at $5, selection of daily Handcrafted Cocktail at $6. You can see their daily cocktail special in advance on their website to pick your favourtite day to go.  Looking forward to going back and having a meal on another occasion."}
{"text":"Very nice interior and ambience. The old fashioned serving idea is pretty cool. The service was also very good. However the food was mediocre and overpriced for the quality.  Overall, due to the food quality, I cannot score more than 3 stars for this restaurant unfortunately."}
{"text":"Knowledgeable staff, friendly, laid back atmosphere, delicious food. What's not to love?  If you're a whiskey connoisseur, a scotch aficionado, or an admitted foodie (or a closet foodie for that matter) this is the place for you.  We had the Discovery Flight, which was a tasting of five distinct whiskeys, which was absolutely lovely. Our meal consisted of the pretzel (which came with a garlic dipping sauce and mustard), the bourbon-honey wings (OH MY GOD!!!) I had the one18 burger which was fantastic, and my wife had the pickled chicken sandwich, also, you guessed it, fantastic.  We got a reservation on OpenTable before we left, and I'm glad we did, because while not uncomfortably so, there is definitely a good crowd for a Tuesday evening.  With an easy walk to the Jack Singer concert hall about a block away, this is a prime place to grab a bite to eat before or even after a show."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for the lunch burger special. Sitting at the bar gives you the option to \"express order\". Just tell them how you want it done. They are $10 with no sides (except a few pickles) but are worth the price. Excellent burger with homemade brioche bun and locally sourced ingredients. You can add fries for $4 which I actually recommend as they come topped with parmesan cheese and herbs."}
{"text":"Tasty menu and great service. This place is great for a late night bite. The bourbon barrel experience is a little much but the drinks taste great!"}
{"text":"As I walked by, I decided to checkout the menu and come to find out this place's specialty is bourbon!  I ordered a few small plates to enjoy my drinks.  Definitely a must try!  Great services, great knowledge, good food and great drinks - can't ask for much more."}
{"text":"Why One18 in a place whose address is 110? Well, before a fire in 1920 destroyed the building and claimed two lives, this was the site of the Empire hotel, located at, you guessed it, 118 9th Ave (Atlantic Ave?). There you have it  - One18 Empire.   This was one of several stories our enthusiastic server told us with an excited interest in both the heritage of the area and the prohibition era foods and drinks the menu incorporates into an old fashioned, Canadian/New Whisky/ey bar.  Located in in the Marriott Hotel, One18 Empire provides enough differentiation from the other establishments in the area and is a great enough deviation from the \"Hotel Lobby Bar/Restaurant\" that, as a local, I would definitely entertain coming here. It meets the needs of the area, as well as the often corporate needs of the hotel.   Their whisky/ey selection is very approachable and impressive to both the pallet and the wallet. Interesting whisky starting at $6/shot and going up to $130 if you are so inclined. They have a whisky menu to satisfy the high rollers, but they definitely aren't pushing you in that direction. Regardless of your price point, they seem to have put effort into building a menu that will have a scotch or bourbon for you.  The food menu is very approachable by both taste and price-point, containing modern spins on western classics - small snacks at $5 or so and many appies in the $8-$12 range. I went with their pretzel ($8, I believe), served with a grainy mustard and cheese sauce - Definitely worth your while for fresh bread to pair with you local beer, whisky, or traditional cocktail."}
{"text":"this review is just based on their service as I did not have opportunity to actually try their food.  Booked them almost 16 days ahead before new years eve for 11 people.. and asked them few times if they are gonna have any special and if so what they would be. I even checked their website and talked to them day before. so far ' nope no special '.. they call me few hours before our reservation letting me know that theres a special 5 course meal and can not order from the menu and it will be $100pp. when i asked why they have not let me know about this before or even yesterday then i could've talked to my group to see if they were still interested.  They had nothing to say .. no sorry nothing... she just said to let her know if i can make it for our reservation. This was really unacceptable and disappointing .. specially during new years even its hard to find a restaurant plus with such a big group we had to choose different restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good BLT and tomato bisque for lunch. Almost a wow.  A lot more than you would think for a classic sandwich. Outstanding service."}
{"text":"Although it's connected to the Hotel and isn't the best looking restaurant and bar, the food and service makes this a great spot in the Calgary downtown core. They have an incredible selection of bourbon and cocktails. I had an old fashions a bourbon cocktail which the best I've ever had. They make their drinks right in front of you with an old barrel and a blow torche - it's pretty impressive! We shared a delicious charcuterie board and tenderloin steaks and a burger as mains. Everyone left quite happy with their meal and experience."}
{"text":"Had a delicious omelette for lunch! Cozy but classy atmosphere. Really enjoyed watching the bartenders make a fancy whisky drink at another table."}
{"text":"A quick update is needed.  We hit One 18 before Vertigo Theatre the other night.  I had the duck breast and it was nothing short of amazing.  Highly recommend.  Decent wine list.  A gazillion bourbons and scotches.  We come here a lot after theater.  The service is friendly but not intrusive."}
{"text":"Goddamnit the food is good! Buttermilk chicken burger with maple bacon and siracha aioli.  A lot of mixology going on that involve blow torches. Attentive staff on a Friday. Food was fast.  Get it."}
{"text":"It's a lovely atmosphere although a tad snobbish. We wanted to sit in the restaurant not the bar and even though there were empty tables, our attire, faces, hair or eye color was not appropriate enough. The scattered hostess \"managed\" to accommodate us in the bar after we showed her a place we could sit. WTF? We have to do your job for you??  The bar menu features lots of great drinks and a myriad of wines and beers. Everyone was happy with the food, wine and beer. Oh yes to the bacon wrapped dates! Plus the mini burgers that went down so quickly. Even the Tri Beet Salad was delish."}
{"text":"The petite tenderloin with the chimichurri sauce was phenomenal! Our server, Meredith, and her manager did an excellent job of making us feel welcome and special. It is our last night in Calgary and we are very glad we chose One18."}
{"text":"Came here for a late brunch on a beautiful Sunday in Calgary. We had just landed and came from the airport. Starving was an understatement. We were staying at the Fairmont downtown and wanted something to eat that was walking distance. We came across One18 Empire and thought we'd give it a try.   As soon as we walked in we were greeted and seated by the friendly hostess who provided the drink and brunch menu. We got mimosas and immediately ordered our food. Our waitress was super friendly and helpful. Our food came out piping hot which is a major plus for me. I had the prime rib omelette which had cheese, mushrooms and arugula also. Their hashbrowns were these little crispy nuggets of hash, almost like a tator tot. My fiancé ordered the burger and it was pretty monstrous. Luckily we were hungry so he was able to finish it the giant burger.   We left the restaurant feeling full, satisfied, and ready to start our trip to discover Calgary!   Side note: the restaurant is part of the Marriott. Restrooms are located in the Marriott lobby."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today.  It was delicious.  Everything on the menu appeared to have a gourmet twist to it.  I had the fried chicken sandwich.  The chicken was tender.  It came with shredded lettuce, a delicious sauce, some pickles, and bacon.  The combination was fantastic.  The fries came with a homemade ketchup.  I also ordered a homemade ginger ale, which was very good with a strong, genuine ginger flavor.  Service was good.  The atmosphere was nice, but casual.  My waiter gave me a soda to go as well as a little bag of 3 light, small pastries to carry out at no extra cost.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"When we first got there it took a few minutes for the waitress to help us and we were left awkwardly standing and I thought uh oh this is going to be a bad time but I was really wrong. Highly impressed by the food quality and taste. The location was really great and the service was awesome. The prices of this place are even better! I got the breakfast in a barrel and it was amazing. Do recommend this place to anyone :)"}
{"text":"We came here for a late brunch on a quick trip to Calgary and found the ambiance to be nice - rustic chic decor and comfortable seating. Being attached to the Marriott, you can use the free lobby WiFi from the Marriott and the bathrooms are located in the hotel and they are clean.  They have a few good healthy options on the menu with the calorie counts next to them. All the unhealthy options don't include calorie counts as to not scare you off. As for healthy things, they have 2 smoothies, oatmeal, greek yogurt parfait, and an egg white omelette.  I got the kale/spinach smoothie ($7) and this was huge, I split it with my fiancé and even half of it was a lot. It's definitely enough for a meal.  We also got the Breakfast in a Barrel ($16) which had breakfast potatoes, 2 poached eggs, sausage, roasted red peppers and sour cream. The potatoes were definitely deep fried and crispy which was delicious but probably not the healthiest. The eggs were cooked perfectly but the sauce / sour cream was a little too much for the dish. I'd probably ask for the sauce or sour cream on the side or on the lighter side.   Between the breakfast in a barrel and the smoothie, this was enough food for the 2 of us. The other brunch things like the fried chicken sandwich or French toast looked delicious and I'd come back to try these. Overall, good experience, good service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and settings. Between the trout spread, the mussels and the steak, I can't decide which of the items I ordered were my favorite. Will go back again."}
{"text":"Lunch express was really living up to the time they say you will be in and out the door - so that's impressive.  Service was impeccable and friendly. The food though is average at best. I guess I was expecting more and was underwhelmed.  Nevertheless, we might give it another try next time just to see if there is improvement on the menu selections."}
{"text":"I was quite impressed with my visit at One18 Empire. I went to try out their Big Taste menu at lunch. Service was extremely prompt - I was with my coworkers, a party of 10, and were able to get in and out within an hour! Our server made sure to ask us right away what our timeline looked like to ensure we wouldn't be late in getting back to work.  For my lunch, I went with the smokey tomato soup and the grilled cheese sandwich (gruyere, tomato, fontina, dubliner, avocado mayo). Both were such great pairings (hello, tomato soup and grilled cheese, that's like a match made in heaven, duh!). I made sure to alternate each bite between sandwich and soup, while dipping the sandwich in the soup. I was also super excited to discover that their regular lunch menu is also only $15 (which includes the grilled cheese and tomato soup and many more options available).  For dessert, I opted for the vanilla bourbon cake. Honestly, it was meh.. but then again, I'm more so a savoury person, so I walked in bias to begin with. I knew I was there for the soup and grilled cheese sandwich.  It was a pretty darn good deal, $15 for a lunch that was super filling and tasty too! I'm very tempted to return outside of Big Taste to try their other lunches now.. or even just to get the grilled cheese again...."}
{"text":"Great staff!  Viktor and Robin made our short experience here so much fun. Would make this a regular spot if this was my home town."}
{"text":"One18 Empire is located at the bottom of the Marriott Hotel and a close hop, skip & jump to Stephens Avenue & the C Train.  On Fridays they have happy hour specials as well as food specials. A private room off to the side offers whiskey tastings for the public and events.  Visited for my second time and brought hubs back for his first time. We shared a few snacks with friends & enjoyed a few cocktails on a Friday afternoon. It's a great date place and we both enjoyed the ambiance and how comfortable it is to just \"be\" there.  From small bites to burgers, to a few bigger bite options it suits all hunger levels and budgets.   A place we keep coming back to."}
{"text":"You know when you visit a new town and you find a fantastic spot that makes you wish you lived there? For me, that is One18 Empire.  While visiting Calgary and looking for some late night bites Yelp pointed me to this spot through proximity and reviews.... I never wanted to leave.  The food is excellent, the drink menu is comprehensive but best of all... The service is exceptional!  The staff was friendly, out-going and made sure we were well taken care of and happy.  Being located in the Marriott is even better because the other diners/out-of-towners were fun to chat with! I hope everyone has a time as wonderful as mine.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"If you are fine food and whiskey lover, and if you can afford it, definitely One18 is the place to be. They have some of the most exquisite cheese and charcuterie selections as well as some fine bartenders. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"So was looking for a good place for lunch and came across One 18 Empire. Looks like a good restaurant in my mind. So made a reservation. To my surprise they have a pretty good lunch deal. For $18 you get a main and a side.  So I got the steak sandwich with the tomatoe bisque  I loved it. I was forewarned that the steak will be cooked medium well. I was ok with it. The steak was juicy and tasty on a garlic toast. The tomatoe bisque was tasty and you can tell that it was made from scratch.   Décor was nice. Basically a fine dining restaurant décor or what you would expect at a fine dining restaurant.  Service was good. Our server came to us and told us about how it would get really busy and that we should order soon if we are in a rush. I also like how many options they have. The server did a good job explaining each dish.   Overall, I had a good experience and I really like the food here. Price is very decent."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The nitro coffee bacon burger has a lot going on but you still taste the meat. And it's so good. Bacon wrapped dates were also excellent. Drink menu is insane. Get the smoked old fashioned - they smoke it tableside which is way cool. I was shocked to realize this was inside the Marriott as we came in the entrance directly off the street. But if I get back to Calgary, I'll be staying here for sure (In the Marriott, not the restaurant!)"}
{"text":"Love service and love the extensive scotch selection for my honey! But some food was not as good as first few times tried here!  Love that you can invent your own old fashioned, but you would have to try many different combos to figure it out!! But interesting."}
{"text":"Don't have cocktails here unless you want the Marriott to rip you off. I ordered a martini and they served me a small portion and charged me for a double. The New Yorker next to me ordered a triple Brandy and left in a huff cause the portion was so tiny. Nice smiles from behind the bar and good food, but the drinks are train robbery."}
{"text":"Beautiful place in a great location!!.. In addition the food and the wine were very very good and the service very friendly and on time!... I went with a group and we ordered appetizers to share and they were all great!... The dates with bacon was my favorite dish, but the scallops were delicious too!.. The calamari was excellent! We also had a dip that was very good and the pretzel was not bad... Regarding the wine: I had Riesling per glass and it was good... I would definitely love to go back there!!"}
{"text":"One night, I got stuck with two whiskey fans looking for whiskey. Luckily for my friends, One18 has a very extensive list and our two whiskey fans were quite impressed. We came here on a saturday evening - easy to get reservations, nice staff, large open space and good lighting. We ordered the pretzel, brussel sprouts, fries and wings. The food was your regular lounge vibe snacks (a little salty but flavourful) but it did pair well with some of our drinks. They do have a nice cocktail selection too (me = not huge whiskey served neat fan). Overall, this is not a bad place to stop by for some drinks, especially if you want to find some good scotch."}
{"text":"This place is EXCELLENT for happy hour.  I couldn't be happier.  They have rotating happy hour drink specials (I had a refreshing gin and tonic that day), along with a great happy hour menu.  They've got an excellent set of wings, which I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Visited One18 Empire for the Big Taste 2016 with a friend.  The Big Taste lunch was only $15 and we each selected the following: - ONE18 Caesar - kale, rustic croutons, preserved lemon vinaigrette, parmesan - I liked it!  The dish is a small metal dish with handles.  I find it a tad small to eat my salad.  Every time I go to pick up a forkful of salad, the cheese or the leaves either falls out of the small dish and onto the table.   - Ciopino - citrus saffron broth, mussels, clams, salmon & charred foccacia.  Seafood stew cooked with halved red olives and dip it with the most delicious toasted focaccia bread.  There were tender pieces of mussels, clams and fish.  I loved it!  I told the maître'd that they should put this dish in their main menu.  I'd come back just for the Ciopino. - Dessert - Vanilla bourbon cake, spiced apples, maple cream - not very sweet and quite delicious!  My friend had the Affogatto, baileys gelatto, lemon madaleine, espresso shot - it was also good!  I had a taste of it.  Also, we both got an extra dessert to go - they are like apple doughnuts (I think), it's great!  There are more selections from their Big Taste lunch menu here: http://calgarydowntown.com/the-big-taste/restaurant?id=45c48cce2e2d7fbdea1afc51c7c6ad26   Quite attentive wait service.  Always checking on our table.  Hurry!  Get a taste of this menu before it disappears!"}
{"text":"Came here during happy hour on a Friday.  Great drink specials on wine and certain Appetizers.  I believe around $5 for certain wines and $2 for house made chips.  Service was fast and friendly.  I ordered the steak sandwich, which was just ok.  Not as flavorful as I would like and steak was a little tough. The steak sandwich cost $24. Highly recommend this place for casual drinks and appy's during happy hour but unsure about dinner."}
{"text":"I booked this restaurant for dining on Halloween night through Open Table simply based on the location. My wife and I were attending the CPO's performance of Nightmare Before Christmas and we wanted a nice dinner before the show. ONE18 Empire is nice and close to Art Commons.  Our reservation was for 6:00pm and we arrived nearly 15 minutes early. We expected to wait but they greeted us immediately upon arrival and sat us right away. It wasn't very busy at the time so I'm sure that helped. All the staff were wearing stylish masks for Halloween. It was a nice touch and added to our Halloween experience.  We got water and menus almost immediately after sitting down and our server greeted us with the drink specials. I took her up on the Old Fashioned, it was delicious and made me feel like Don Draper!  After a short while the drinks arrived and she took our food order. We went for the calamari and hot pretzel as starters. For our mains, my wife ordered the portobello mushroom dish and I got the ribeye steak.  The food all came out as expected and we were both very impressed with our main dishes. I have to say the steak was pretty darn good! The mushroom dish was very flavourful and would be something I'd order for myself the next time. Dessert was equally awesome.  All in all, this was pretty much the perfect dining experience except for a minor mix up on our bill which was rectified quickly and easily. Our server was super friendly and efficient, giving us just the right amount of attention.  Our bill was just over $110 which was very reasonable for 2 appys, 2 mains, 2 desserts and four drinks. Very affordable and we got more than our fill for the price.  I highly recommend giving these guys a try, we'll certainly be back when looking for a nice, affordable dinner downtown."}
