{"text":"Great food for good prices. Way better than any filibertos or any of those. Meat is so tender and juicy everytime. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Have been eating their Carne Asada Burritos and Tacos since they were on 7st and Mountain View and have yet to have anything better..."}
{"text":"So far, my new favorite place for a carne asada burrito in this town. Huge. Fresh. Delicious. Also ordered rolled tacos with guac which were tasty. However, there is an additional 50 cent charge when paying with plastic which is lame."}
{"text":"Native Arizonan here: we love Mexican food!!  Mexican food is my chicken soup, my default no fail friend. Since I started driving I was eating carne asada burritos around town as my go-to sustenance.  Vaqueros is all the good things I need in a fast Mexican place: dual drive through, large menu, horchata, red or green hot sauce, crispy tacos piled with shredded cheese!!  My favorite is the carne asada burrito- served super hot!  Also the shredded beef tacos are awesome.  I've gotten a combo with an enchilada before and both times the cheese inside was not melted.  Also the chicken taco has a nice garlic flavor but not shredded chicken but diced.   The drive through girl is super nice!  She recognizes her customers which is appreciated by regulars."}
{"text":"Best place for super nachos by far not like the other fast food joints they actually do load on the toppings also get a horchata to wash it down"}
{"text":"Great California burrito and carne asada.  Reminds me of my hometown San Diego style taco shops"}
{"text":"Great food with great prices. One of the many few places that don't surcharge for using your card."}
{"text":"I was in the area so I came back and gave them another try.  Glad to see they got rid of that silly credit card fee.  The burrito didn't seem as big as they used to be but the meat was tasty and they also didn't hold back on the pico they put in it.    The cashier was friendly and they gave enough salsa for the entire burrito.  I would come back if I was in the mood for a quick carne asada burrito."}
{"text":"After reading a really good review today, I felt like saying yes. I agree. I've been eating there for years now. They have really good food, the ladies at the window are friendly and it's quick and cheap."}
{"text":"The drive through chick Carmen is always rude and treats customers like crap. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The people were semi-ok customer service. Not impressing, but I don't care as much about that. Short and to the point is find with me.  I do care about food quality, and this one was not the best."}
{"text":"This place...wow. I have some pretty high expectations of Mexican Food especially being from LA. All these fast food crap holes that end in Bertos have really given me a bad impression of how Arizona does Mexican food. In fact, if it wasn't for places like Tacos Huicho and even Tacos mich on a good day, I'd refuse to live here. Those fancy hipster tacos don't cut it either (although occasionally surprisingly fantastic, Presidio Cocina I'm looking at you). This Vaquero location makes my tummy so happy. It's not the best Mexican food in Arizona (that award goes to Tacos Huicho) but it is the epitome of LA Mexican comfort fast food. I first went there because I wanted GOOD Carne Asada fries and I'd been repeatedly dissapointed by everywhere else in Phoenix. They were DANK. Not the best I've had in my life but by far the best in Phoenix. And that real Guac....it should be a requirement for Guac to be chunky and not just green liquid. Then I, for personal reasons, have had to become kind of vegetarian for a while. The idea of a breakfast burrito without bacon or steak seems almost pointless. How the hell they managed to make me love a potato and cheese burrito is beyond me...but they did it.   My only complaint is their salsas kinda suck but I'm mexican so I make my own salsas anyway. Or I buy a container of already made homestyle salsa from Huicho."}
{"text":"Awesome Carne Asada burrito. This thing is huge! The flavors of the meat and the pico de gallo, are so good. Consistent and reliable. Love it."}
{"text":"I just tried Vaquero's for the first time today.  Since carne asada is in the name of the restaurant, I figured it only made sense to order the carne asada burrito.  I have been working on this monolithic culinary creation for the last twenty minutes.  I feel like I am completing an eating challenge on \"Man vs. Food.\"  This burrito is HUGE - and tasty.  I don't know if I'll eat again until tomorrow.  Delicious, priced right, and HUGE.  Bring an appetite; these guys don't mess around."}
{"text":"Probley one of the worst fish tacos I've ever had fish was dry,this was a to go order no fork included window server barley Congenial"}
{"text":"I get the number 6 every time and I couldn't imagine anything being better! The #6 comes with a burrito (get shredded beef) a cheese enchilada and rice and beans. Rice and beans are flavorful and not bland, and the quality is always 10/10. For 8.15 it fills me ALL THE WAY UP. Vaqueros consistent quality and large portions has me hooked 4 life."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is always delish and consistent.  They actually season the carne and you won't find rubbery bits. Love the Asada tacos and pollo Asado. Tacos de Alambre are also delicious carne Asada with grilled peppers onions and bacon. Mmmhmmmm.  The regular shredded beef taco is bomb too. Better than almost any sit down restaurant in the valley. Doesn't compare to any of the \"beto's\"."}
{"text":"Vaquero's is my go to Mexican comfort food stop when I'm near the Camelback Corridor. This place is not too far from the Biltmore area and is a lot easier on your wallet then the handful of Mexican restaurants along Camelback Road.  I can get a couple of huge tacos in the $5 to $6 dollar range. Checkout my photos of the Carnitas Tacos, for example. You can two ginormous tacos that can be easily portioned off into 4 decent size tacos. Not only is the price right, wait for it.............but come on down for some tasty tacos, the taste is right too. I have to say the chicken tacos are my favorite. I get two hard tacos with chicken and gobs of finely shredded cheese. There is no skimping on ingredients here. This place also has decent fish menu items as well. But I mostly stay with the tacos when I order my to go orders. The heat on the food varies, but they have hot sauce available for most pallets.  I stay out of the Arizona heat by going over and eating my bounty at the local fast food joint down the street since this place doesn't have indoor seating.They have a couple of covered picnic benches outside."}
{"text":"Great food, theres no taco shop in the valley thats better. Reminds me of the Vaquero's back home in San Diego, we referred to as \"the barrel\"."}
{"text":"I can't rate the carne asada because I didn't try it, but the chicken hard tacos are some of the best I've had. I love that it's seasoned grilled chopped chicken rather than stewed or shredded chicken like most places serve. The shredded beef hard tacos were great as well. The only thing is the hot sauce is inconsistent. One time it will be SO hot I can't eat it and the next time it will be weak and watery. To me the hot sauce makes the taco and I want to know its going to be consistent when I decide to eat there."}
{"text":"The food here is a lot better than a few of the other Spanish food spots around. I love that it's usually open really late as well, those spots are hard to find around this area."}
{"text":"For decently priced casual style Mexican food this is the best I've had so far. The prices are very fair for the portion size. The carne Asada burrito is one of the best I have had and it was very large. Rolled tacos are on point with how they are priced. I haven't been disappointed with any thing from here yet."}
{"text":"Food is obnioxiously, insainely, tremendously delicicious, savory, and hot! It's always what they've got! Weather it's the guac, You've got to get down to this block! Try the Carne Asada Don't even Bother To use your debit Or you'll regret it!  Best late night snack!"}
{"text":"Alright, so I have now experienced several different items on the menu (this has become Mr. Tyger's FAVORITE restaurant, so he requests it almost daily *smh*...variety is NOT a dirty word!)   While the rolled tacos were yummy, I have to take a moment to highly suggest the chicken tacos...as a valid option for hangover food. Not that I would EVER get hungover *glancing upwards to see if lightning is going to strike me again today*...but if I were to do so, the grilled yumminess of their chicken taco is enough to calm my angry innards and outards so I can buffer the tylenol/aleve/aspirin/advil cocktail before passing back out into delightful oblivion.  Mmmmm tacos.....zzzzzzzzzz...."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner last night. I ordered an horchata to drink. It had a really nice cinnamony flavor to it and the horchata flavor was strong. I really like the horchata here. I ordered the 12 rolled tacos with guacamole, lettuce, and cheese. I was a little disappointed with how little lettuce and cheese there was on top of the rolled tacos. The amount I got on top I would expect for an order of 5, but definitely not 12. I also wish there was more guacamole, but I get it avocados are expensive. The rolled tacos themselves were super crunchy but not over cooked where you think you may break a tooth eating them. They were lacking a bit on the meat department on the inside. They need to add maybe 25% more meat so you can really actually taste it and not just the tortilla. The salsa here was good. I liked it, but it wasn't exactly a salsa I would tell other people about. I also ordered a flan. I was a little sad it was a store bought flan. The flan was super thick and not very creamy. I wouldn't buy it here again.   The pricing seems reasonable for what you are getting.   They have a drive through so you can order and take it home. If you want to stay and eat, you order at the window and they have sitting outside in this covered area."}
{"text":"best carne asada in the valley. don't go here for anything else or it'll just be okay."}
{"text":"Awesome place friendly service and my carne asada burrito was super fresh and absolutely amazing. Forget about the negative reviews this place is awesome . I am glad I have chosen to eat here"}
{"text":"If it's late at night, you've had one too many drinks (you're obviously not driving at this point) and you're looking for a bomb breakfast burrito this is the spot.   I haven't tried anything else here so I can't give you a very diverse opinion, but I can dang sure assure you that the breakfast burritos here are on point!"}
{"text":"Mexican fast food.  Everything I've tried is always good and big portions.  They do have  JR menu which is actually just as much food, but a little bit cheaper.    I haven't had any issues with their food.  Everything is always tasty and warm and prepared as fresh possible.  Have tried the carne asada quesadilla/burrito/tostada, super nachos, chicken tostada, rolled tacos, breakfast burritos....I haven't had problem with service either."}
{"text":"Update:  ordered a ham and cheese breakfast burrito the cost was 5. I told them to add beans. The charged an extra 86 cents. With taxes it came out to 6.27 they're tax bracket is a little high. I wanted to pay with my card so the charge an extra 50 cents which is double of the normal fee even though because I'm spending more than 3 dollars their fee isn't as big as the normal fee. So if you do the math they should have charged me 6.77...well then they taxed me again ...so my cheap little breakfast burrito was costing me 8.00...I told them about their mistake and they didn't want to return the difference. So after the food was done. I told them to cancel the order and return my money since they had charged it before even telling me all these ridiculous fees and over charges. Went down the street to a high end restaurant got the same burrito for 4 dollars."}
{"text":"Can't expect much from these fast food joints. But really....where is the meat in these rolled tacos?!?!  The service was very friendly though"}
{"text":"Amazing place It blows Filiberto's out of the water with taste , price and customer service as well as portion sizes"}
{"text":"Only tried the super nachos and California burrito both great. I recommend the California burrito with french fries and guacamole."}
{"text":"I used to go the one on the south side,till I moved, but I get there carne Asada fries cause it's 2x the size of filibertos for a good price. Me and my BF usually share. They also got 5 dollar burritos again pretty big. Wait time may be a little long but it's fresh! FYI: The place does charge only .50 for use of card but that don't stop me from getting my food."}
