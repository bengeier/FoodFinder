{"text":"In my world, pizza is a food group.   Coming from an Italian family and raised on Toronto and Naples pizza... I am very picky.   Calgary is home to Greek pizza or what others call authentic. Boo to that... yuck. 
But..... 
Stop the bus... this is really really good.   Thin crust, excellent prosciutto and flavors are fresh.   
For Alberta... there are so few choices but it seems that this place gets it.  
Please try it... I want to see it be successful and stay \" in the hood\""}

Food wise I'd easily give them 5 stars. Both of our pizzas were delicious. My salad was great and the balsamic dressing was delicious.
However, the \"Customer Service\" was less than desirable.
We used Skip the Dishes to place an order for pick up. I prefer to order online because the cellular reception in our area is pretty bad so this helps reduce error.
Almost immediately after I placed my order I received a call from who I assume was the manager. He told me they don't have Boylan soda. No big deal I had seen that they had San Pelligrino also so I asked for one of those instead. He asked me to repeat myself and then said no they don't have that. Only coke products. So I settled for iced tea. Again not the worst, but still fairly annoying.
My husband went to pick up the order and that was a complete mess. The person who was there had to have it explained to her that Skip the Dishes offers pick up service and she gave my husband a hard time, then he gave her my information and they still made him contact me and give them the order number. I'm pretty sure some random dude isn't  coincidentally showing up on time for my order to steal my pizza. And I understand they have to do their job, but again we were met with attitude from the get go. 
I will give them a little more time to get settled in, and try them again. Hopefully they can make it because their pizza is great, but they really need to work on the customer service side and maybe they shouldn't have jumped into using skip the dishes without properly reviewing their menu and training their staff. Next time we will physically go there and oder and see if we have a better experience. I look forward to updating my review."}
{"text":"So so so sad. 
Went here right when it opened and it was awesome.  Went back three weeks later, total disaster. Waited 50 minutes for two pizza's and still ended up walking out with only one. 
Management seems completely indifferent. Or maybe it was the their sleeping baby in the car out front and the crying toddler in the back storage room that needed 90 % of their attention. But one lady taking the orders that had some semblance of a clue as to what was going was constantly running outside to check on one child then in the back to check on the other. Hey I have three kids myself I get it, but you don't have child care I don t think your fledging business is the place. 
So sad really hope they figure it out. But not holding my breath."}
