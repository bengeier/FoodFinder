{"text":"Traveling on business and Nick's was the first place we chose for lunch. What a great choice! Nick and the rest of the staff were so friendly. I got a grilled chicken salad and the soup (vegetable for the day), both were AMAZING! The chicken was some of the best chicken I've ever had and the soup was so flavorful. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! The staff is so warm and welcoming. We were able to try the chili and soup of the day (both amazing), and we were even given a sample of the gyro beforehand. The gyro special was my favorite! Everything is made same day and fresh so you can feel good about the food you are eating. I definitely recommend this place 10/10. I have no complaints whatsoever!"}
{"text":"Well priced specials, something new almost every day, they're friendly and committed to excellent customer service. I'f I've ever had a bad experience there they've more than made up for it. Nick seems to care about every customer personally. Try this place out.

Edit: I upped this review to 5 stars from 4 because the customer service is just REALLY good. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I dropped by this place which is located right across from the driving test centre in Oakville while our daughter was doing her driving test.

There is a real Nick who is super friendly who was running the place.
We had a quick light lunch of cesare salad, chicken pita and the soup of the day which was very generous sized serving of beef barley soup.

This place caters to the breakfast / lunch crowds for the area businesses and there were many take away orders while I was there.

Super friendly service and good food is a recipe for success and this place has it!

And our daughter passed her driving test which made our day!"}
{"text":"Had the banquet burger with fries. Food is standard fare but what takes it up a notch is the friendly service. Great workers, and a decent place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Great little cafe right across from the road test centre.  

Very friendly owner and has such great passion for his food.  His name is Nick.  Very generous servings too.  We had the minestrone soup and grilled deluxe cheese sandwich.  Very tasty.  

Menu has great options and is clean and has a cosy atmosphere.  

Prices are reasonable as well."}
