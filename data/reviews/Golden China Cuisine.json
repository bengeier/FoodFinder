{"text":"Horrible service, I had to wait 2 hours for my food to be delivered & was told it'd only be 45-50 minutes. I called after an hour & was told they are busy & driver left with my order & it should arrive in 20.. finally after another hour I got my food.  Upon arrival, I realized I was missing 1 wonton soup, and was sent the wrong noodles.   I was not offered any compensation for this mess..   The food was just ok, rice was bland. I did like the chilli chicken though.   I won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese restaurant in Woodbridge. Hands down the best value for your money and the food is fresh and delicious. Oil is fresh and chicken balls are out of this world. Highly recommend over the other locales in Vaughan...Been a resident for 25+ years"}
{"text":"Don't know why this place has such a high rating. The food in my opinion taste a little bit off. Tried two different combination plates n even tho it's supposed to be two different sauces in the chicken it still tasted the same. Definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"This is a newly opened restaurant. We got a flyer in the mail so decided to check it out, to satisfy that North American Chinese craving.  Due to the discount on cash-pick-up orders, the place already had a decent stream of customers on a quiet Tuesday evening.   The front clerk was friendly, speaks fluent English. The place is small but has a decent amount of seating for dine-in. Newly opened so it's a clean joint. The kitchen is openly visible from the counter, which is nice I guess if you like to see where you food comes from.   Prices are decent for the portions you get, no complaints there.   The food is spot on North American Chinese, with all your typical favourites. The textures, tastes, and looks are pretty much right on. It made me think these people are definitely not first-timers, and have probably worked at or owned other Chinese restaurants in the past.   Chicken balls had flavourful chicken breast filling, though the dough was slightly on the chewy side. Sweet and sour sauce is moderate in strength, which I prefer but my wife did not.  Cantonese Chow Mien was excellent, nice crisp vegetables, squat yet slightly crispy noodles, abundant pieces of chicken, tender beef, and nice sized prawns! Was surprised not seeing small shrimp.  Stir fried vegetables were fresh, green and crisp, well done.   We didn't feel overly thirsty afterwards, which is a good sign.   We will be going back to try out their other offerings. This is a good local fix for some quick Chinese take-out."}
{"text":"Really nice Chinese food place. I am no expert in Chinese feed, but I really like the variety here. Soups, sesame chicken, bbq pork ribs, all great. Awesome lunch specials. Really worth it. I am a regular.  Extremely friendly. Kitchen is open, very clean."}
{"text":"Mmm mmm yummy noodles! Food is tasty, no extra salt, and not oily either! I love the take out packaging as well! This place so far takes the win for Chinese noodles in Woodbridge.. no other restaurant up here has it right :)"}
{"text":"So clean and amazingly warm service.  We ordered general tao chicken special.   Was one of the best I have eaten in a while.  The healthy family special was also outstanding.  Dumplings steamed were a bit rubbery but the healthy portioned chicken balls made up for it.    Won ton soup is okay.  6 LARGE beef wonton in the soup. The portion is very generous but could have used a bit of salt.    Most of the food was low on salt which is weird for Chinese food... but reassuring.   We spent $50 on dinner and took home for lunch tomorrow.  So much left overs.  Will we be back?  Absolutely.  General Tao lunch is in the near future for me.  Great experience.  Thanks for doing a great job"}
