{"text":"I really want to like this place. I have always wanted to try Big Tuna ever since I first saw it. Today we finally got a chance to do so. Things were... not exactly how I wanted it to be, but it was not horrible. Please do better Big Tuna!!!

Location: The place was well hidden, if you are not from the area you are most likely to miss it. The inside was dark and poorly lit, not something a restaurant wants to be, better lightning attracts customers. Minimum decor, although nice but doesn't stand out or leave an impression. 

Menu: Quite simple with 4 signature dishes (or rather, bowls), and the option to customize your own. The menu isn't not over complicated and easy to navigate. 

Food: I tried the Tuna signature bowl (Hakata if my memory serves me right). Taste was alright but the tuna was not fresh, the after taste was a little fishy. I'm guessing because the display fridge or bar was not cold enough. My gf tried the salmon one which was okay. Rice is a bit dry disappointing. 

Service: It was okay, nothing fancy, our guy was nice to us and attentive. thumps up!

Please pay attention to your fish and rice, they are your main characters."}
{"text":"I had a DIY bowl over mixed greens, and really enjoyed it. This is a really healthy place to stop for lunch or for a snack, and it's pretty accomodating to meat-eaters and vegetarians alike. I do wish the bowls were a tad bigger, but for a light lunch the small bowl works just fine, and it's much better for you than a lot of other options in the area."}
{"text":"Service was great ! A bit disappointed on the tuna poke though , sauce was too salty and the extra $2 avocado was not wroth it ( very small piece of avocado and small amount as well) agreed with others as well, different from the one that I had in LA Venice beach , but if they can just adjust the recipe a bit , I would visit again"}
{"text":"I brought my friends here excited to try the Poke. The flavors were not great. We had the ninja and custom built bowl. Sorry guys the fish tasted super fishy and the shoyu was vinegary. I won't have the courage to come back not after the side of cut eye we got. I'll dream about a hefty bowl of fresh fish swimming in Hawaiian flavors that I had on the west coast."}
{"text":"Very friendly, casual, compact neighborhood restaurant in Koreatown. Delicious, fresh, healthy food. Ask for \"The Max,\" not on the menu."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened and I love the place. 

 Their poke bowls are good and the customer service is impeccable. I made a mistake the other day and ordered without specifying gluten free ponzu. By the time I realised my mistake and called them, they'd already made my bowl. They were really kind about remaking it and telling me not to worry.

Also, the spicy mayo is a great addition to the more traditional bowls, though I also like El Guapo."}
{"text":"Was very excited for this, but it ended up... Meh. 

Way too much rice, not enough toppings or fish. The rice was also mushy. The spicy mayo had no flavour.... Just tasted like plain mayo. A large bowl with a drink was almost $20....way too much for the size of the dish.

Had poke in other places (Hawaii and SF), and expected much more"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying poke and I decided to order the ninja and was not disappointed. The salmon was fresh and delicious and I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of toppings they offered. 

I was also happy to find out that they had a liquour licence and served Asahi beer. Nothing like poke and an ice cold Asahi on a hot summer day. The staff were friendly and professional which isn't always the case in Korea town...

I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Small portion and expensive ($15 for a \"large\" bowl).

My poké in particular was over-seasoned with ponzu (I think?) and I couldn't taste much of the fish."}
{"text":"Had the tuna classic. Marinade was nice! But unfortunately the portions were small and pricey. Sashimi chunks were a small too compared to the Poke I used to get in Honolulu."}
{"text":"First time trying Poke, loved Big Tuna Poke's take on it. Fish was very fresh. While the ingredients were less than other Poke offerings, I though they want well together a thoroughly enjoyed my meal. Have already been back twice!"}
{"text":"Ordered through UberEATS. What a mistake. Next time I'll read the reviews. This is by far the worst poke in Toronto. Tuna tastes like nothing. Pretty sure it's frozen. Ordered a large with extra tuna and I got a medium with regular tuna. Please don't waste your time with them."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with poke so I have nothing to compare it to, but I had a craving for some raw fish on rice but didn't feel like my usual sushi places, so I thought I'd check this place out for a late lunch. I ordered the salmon with spicy mayo in sushi rice. I think it's the Ninja bowl... I thought it was fantastic! The presentation was intricate and beautiful, the portion was huge (I really don't know what others are complaining about - I was stuffed!) and the wasabi peas added a nice crunch and spicy kick. I didn't opt for the additional avocado, so it came to about $14 with tax for the large. Considering the amount of fish that was included, I thought that was more than reasonable. 

 I will definitely be back to try their other options!"}
{"text":"Day 2 of Poké Week and this place was more on the underwhelming side.  First off, although the main server wasn't rude or anything, he was not attentive or as enthusiastic especially since we mentioned that we were passport holders.  Not expecting for him to roll out the red carpet or to kiss our asses, but he could've at least made the experience a little more exciting to try and get more votes. I mean, that is the whole point of having and being involved in Poké Week, no? 

I guess with Poké Week, each place will be serving up their signature bowls.  We asked this server what the deal is with their place and he did say that it was a customized bowl.  Period.  No explanation, no detail, nothing.  Hence my comment about the lack of enthusiasm.  

Our bowl consisted of both salmon and ahi tuna, avocado, cucumbers, fried onions, seaweed, cilantro, black & white sesame seeds, some sauce (I didn't even hear him say what kind of sauce) and of course, rice.  Presentation was beautiful, yet deceiving. The amount of salmon and tuna was not much, the rice was lacking some water so it was on the harder side (whoever cooked the rice, needs to add just a little bit more water). Cilantro kind of threw me off a little and thankfully, there wasn't much of it either.  In all honesty, if it weren't for the seaweed, the bowl would've tasted quite bland.  I'm glad the bowl just cost us $5 with the passport.  Otherwise, I would've been even more disappointed if we had paid regular price for it. 

3/5 rating for the food but 2 star for both food and experience."}
{"text":"I heard of this place online and decided to try. They made it seem like they always sell out and it's super popular. Though when I went, there were a few people there. Poke is suppose to be refreshing, light and super fresh. They say their fish is fresh, however the tuna in my bowl looked half cooked. The color wasn't bright red, it was borderline dingy, grayish and looked unappetizing. On top of that, they barely mixed anything. The guy who made my bowl loosely mixed it with a spoon and squirted some sauce. The rice was undercooked and mushy. The warm mushy rice topped with warm raw tuna was bad. The fish should of been cold paired with fluffy rice. To say I was disappointed was the least. I was planning on ordering from them for a party of 30, but after trying, I think not. If you're looking for good poke, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Not much flavour, tuna was tasteless and small portion for the price."}
{"text":"Worst experience at a poke restaurant. It's a hidden restaurant and the sign is not very obvious. I had a hard time locating this place the first time I came.

The inside looks dirty. Dirty restaurant is definitely a big no no when it comes to poke. When all the ingredients are raw. The portions are also not well justified for the price I paid.

Probably wouldn't recommend this place or come back again. 

Service was quick, it was dead inside both times I had eaten here."}
{"text":"Conclusion, the poke bowls at this place is not exactly what I had in mind or what I had in SF. The location is thousands of miles away from the west coast, so is their food. Maybe they were using the wrong cuts of fish or the wrong toppings or its something else. The experience was much different than the crisp and refreshing bowl I was expecting. 

Food one star. I'll add a star for the decor."}
{"text":"Delicious Poké bowls! I ate the Ninja bowl and it was absolutely delightful.

Great staff and awesome environment.

Highly recommended and will come back again!

Finally a poké bar in Toronto!"}
{"text":"NOPE.

I was super stoked to hear that Toronto is finally getting their own poke bar and even more excited to try. Being completely spoiled in LA (I had poke 3x that week), I definitely had expectations. Walking  in - you already feel like a pile of sweat (they do not have AC). How are you serving fresh fish and how are we supposed to eat it in that kind of environment? You can easily install a window AC unit (top left window panel of your store front would fit one nicely).

On to the food, my large poke bowl came up to $15. I got the ahi tuna with brown rice (they had no more spring mix and the brown rice was so overcooked - it was mushy) and they limit you to 6 toppings AND avocado is extra. I feel like they're pretty stingy on the ingredients as well.. such a disappointment. My boyfriend got his poke on sushi rice and the rice taste awful - way too much rice vinegar. 

Their ordering system isn't very efficient either - the cashier writes down your order plus your 6 toppings. Why can't you just have the person on bar do it? I'm sure they're capable of counting to 6 toppings. Have one person do cash, one person scoop the rice/salad and put the fish into the bowl/mix the sauce and have one person add the toppings. Definitely more efficient than cashier standing there and trying to fit our orders on a sticky note.

I do like their space (if only it wasn't like an oven in there). But overall, I would not come back. Overpriced for mediocre quality."}
{"text":"Finally got to try a poke bowl in Toronto. Loved it when I went to Hawaii. Got the Ninja bowl and it was pretty delicious, went during their happy hour as well and got a side of their nachos! 
Overall food was great and fresh!!"}
{"text":"I've had dozens and dozens and dozens of poke bowls here.   I used to have weekly Wednesday appointments in the neighbourhood which gave me a chance to have a poke bowl at Big Tuna every week.   Every experience there was a delight.

  I initially started with the fixed bowls and loved them.   Now, I just ask Ahn, or whoever is behind the creation table, to make me something marvellous.   And they do.   And it is always fresh, creative, and delicious.

Sometimes I and they have time for a chat and sometimes I and they don't.     All good. 

Now, sadly, I no longer have regular appointments in the neighbourhood, so I get there as and when I can.    I do make the effort though because the food and the people who prepare and serve it are worth me showing up.

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this new Poké place on Bloor St West because that's pretty much what I ate almost every day in Maui. The space is small as you enter, limited seating and small L shaped counter where one person takes your order & cash and the cook builds your Poké bowl. I ordered the Ninja which has tuna, veggies, taro chips topped with a spicy mayo and served on rice. I shouldn't be comparing what they serve to Hawaiian Poké but the taste wasn't very flavorful and the portion on the small side. For $10.95 (pre-tax) I was still hungry afterwards."}
{"text":"Poke was quite popular among Instagram users, and I had never really tried any until I bumped into this little bar. 
Conclusion: The Poke bowl that I got was good as the fish was fresh, toppings were nicely prepared veggies, with delicious sauce and a base of sushi rice. Worth trying :)"}
{"text":"I love it here! The food is so fresh, delicious, and well portioned. Every bite gives you a little of everything and you can finish it all feeling satisfied and not gross. The flavors are unique and the prices are better than a lot of the other Poke places I have tried in Toronto. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"As a big time chirashi don eater, I was excited to hear that poke had finally made its way to Toronto.  Finally, a bit more variety in the raw fish on rice world.  I've had a number of poke bowls all over the city, and Big Tuna is by far my favourite.  

I've had the Katuna and the El Guapo and I've enjoyed them both.  I like that the toppings and fish are all mixed together with the sauce then topped on the rice, rather than some other places in town that treat poke like a grain bowl and just dump stuff on top and squirt sauce all over it.  

They truly care about the quality of their ingredients.  The fish is clearly good quality and cut like good sushi - no gross chewy pieces here.  I went once and they didn't feel like their avocado was ripe enough, so they wouldn't serve it.  I'd much rather have them do that than have rock hard avocado in my bowl.  On the downside, I've also been there before right at lunch and their fish delivery hadn't yet arrived.  No poke for me that day.  

The large doesn't look that big, but looks can be deceiving.  I've never been hungry after I've finished it.  About $15 for the large is totally reasonable.  I mean, what do people expect?  It's fresh, raw fish.  

Honestly, all of these lukewarm reviews have me puzzled.   Big Tuna makes awesome poke.  If you don't like raw fish on rice, this place is not for you."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with my visit. Was very excited to try this place after recommendations and seeing posts on social media. However, definitely not worth the money!! 
I paid $15 for a large bowl (the size of my fist), which was not much bigger than the small bowl, and they wrote my order down but still messed it up completely. 

Firstly I wanted the tuna, but they ran out of tuna...so settled for the salmon. 
I asked for the main sauce to be ponzu and a little bit of spicy mayo but saw them prepping salmon that was smothered in mayo and I asked if that one was mine because I asked for ponzu as main. Looking down at the post-it, realized that they messed it up. They were about to offer to re-do it but they didn't even have enough salmon left for one more order. So I just said it was fine.  They continued to top my order (with the tiniest portions each...) and put it up when finished, but I noticed it's missing something. 
They completely forgot to put one topping altogether.  

Just a pretty terrible experience altogether. 

Overall portion size: really small
Toppings: very little 
Quality: okay
Staff: nice but don't really know what they're doing"}
{"text":"I'm so sorry Big Tuna but I gotta hop on the meh train. This was my first poke in the big smoke and I wasn't a fan... Looking forward to trying other interpretations around town."}
{"text":"hmm... it's not the best poke bowl I had in Toronto
We ordered the Regular size ninja. 
Although the fish was fresh, the overcooked rice ruined everything for me. However the spicy mayo salvaged the whole bowl lol 

It's on the more pricier side comparing the portion served (kind of small even for a regular) and to other poke places I've been to. Probably best to go to other poke places for the experience."}
{"text":"Since its newly opened, I assume they may be still working out some stuff. For example, when we visited it was extremely hot and stuffy inside which didn't feel like a great environment to enjoy raw fish. 

They kept some water in the fridge for dine-in customers and that helped a bit. On a hot summers day you probably wouldn't want take out either, unless you live nearby or you'd end up with tepid raw fish bowl.

I thought the size for a regular portion was okay, though it might be a tad on the small size if you're starving. I'd recommend you'd just make your own bowl because they do have a lot of good toppings (like lotus chips!) to choose from. I was jealous of my friend's custom bowl as my Big Katuna just had a lot of cucumber. I felt like the dish was missing that bold, fresh flavour I would expect, but that might have been because of how ridiculously hot it was inside."}
{"text":"3.5 stars (4 stars for food, minus .5 for price)

I had \"The Ninja\" and \"The Big Katuna\". I found both to be quite delectable, however, I did enjoy the Big Katuna  a bit more. 

Contrary to other reviews, I felt the fish to rice portion was appropriate. Any more fish, and it would be overwhelming.

Similar to what other yelpers are saying, it is slightly pricier than what I expected. However, I do like it and already came back twice. With new poke places opening up all around the city, I wonder how Big Tuna will compete.

On a side note, whenever I see poke, I always think of pokemon. I wonder if they've taken advantage of the pokemon go craze and used it for advertisement..."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this given all the hype.  I went at 8:30 on a weeknight and was able to dine-in.  The space is small so I can imagine it must be stuffy at a peak time.  I don't eat fish so I can't comment on their core dish but I had the vegan bowl with agedashi tofu.  The large was tiny (especially for $12.95 + tax)!!! It is half the size of a bowl at Freshii (just by way of example).  When I remarked at the size, they reassured me that it was filling ... not so much seeing as we had to grab dessert after.  The dish was good (could have used more sauce) but I wouldn't rush back."}
{"text":"I ordered a Regular Ninja off of UberEATS and it did not taste like a good poke. It sadly tasted like raw fish on plain rice and the temperature did not fit (This may just be because of serving time of UberEATS). I've had poke three other times and this was the most bland. My favourite part of the poke were the taro chips which helped add texture.
One bad thing about poke (in general) is it is so dense so often times it looks like you don't get enough food for your money, but the food here was filling regardless of the size.
Overall, I would not order here again because it was bland and there are better poke places in Toronto."}
{"text":"Dropped in because we saw the place from the other side of the street and the food option was compatible with our food craving of the moment.
Portions aren't huge but the quality of the food was good. Had the tuna bowl. It was spiced just right and we added a litre spicy mayo.
Would go back for sure.

Please get your AC fixed or get some fans. It was unbearable in the place."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place out, so I ordered the big katuna with what turned out to be too high expectations. There was wayyyy too much sauce on my bowl, all I tasted was salty ponzu. Apparently mine was made by a new person, since she kept asking questions to another staff about how to put the ingredients together. I took it to go which was saving grace since I was at least able to mix it with other non salty things to finish the toppings. Didn't eat the rest of the rice, too drenched in ponzu."}
{"text":"Got a build my own bowl with tuna and it was delicious! The toppings are all weighed and measured out so you don't feel shorted. It wasn't busy in there so my friend stayed to eat. One of the employees even served us complementary tea."}
{"text":"I was so excited for this place that once my coworker told me , I immediately ran out on my break and drove 30 mins to buy one. 

I wasn't that impressed. The first thing I noticed was that the avocado (paid an extra $1) had brown spots and wasn't completely ripe. They come in slices but I feel like it would work a lot better if it was cubed. There was a good variety of  toppings but they don't really put much.  The tuna and the toppings tasted good. The rice was steaming hot, which really turned me off considering the rest of the food was supposed to be served cold. The first thing my coworker said when he saw it was , \"why is it so small?\" I paid for the large and needless to say it was still \"small\".  I was still hungry after spending $15.(I have a small appetite)

Not sure I would go back."}
{"text":"I've tried many of the poke bars in Toronto.. and honestly this is still my favorite spot. It's considered pricey for most people, but the amount of protein and other toppings they give were way more than other poke bars in the city || and other poke bars' price were similar too. It looks small but it actually fills me up (with a large of course since I'm a big eater) but my friends all order regular and it's pretty filling for them too! I'd totally come MORE if it's closer to me."}
{"text":"I got the large Ninja signature bowl tonight and I have to say it was only ok. For the price, it wasn't as big as other bowls I've had.  I wasn't the biggest fan of wasabi peas on it either but that's personal preference. 

For the price/portions, I'm more likely to go to any of the Korean restaurants in the area next time."}
{"text":"Really good, I had the \"Big Katuna\" the classic and it was delicious. I've had poke many times in Hawaii so know how good it can be. I got the regular size and wish it had been bigger or that they weighed the tuna so I knew that I wasn't getting less than usual. Not enough for a full meal but still enjoyable."}
{"text":"Can't help but feel like majority of negative reviews are based on price. I bought the large bowl for 15, which I also at first thought was a pretty hefty price... But once I started eating it I realized that with the amount of fish they put in my bowl, I would 100% be ok with coming back and spending the money again. 

I ordered the classic. They were very generous with the ahi tuna. But unfortunately, were also too generous with the sauce. They need to cut back 1/2 the sauce. I wished the ponzu was lighter and less heavy and citrusy but it was too sweet and too acidic and not enough savouriness going on (soy sauce). Other than that, I would love to come back again!"}
{"text":"I ordered \"the ninja\" (regular size) and had pretty mixed feelings about it. On one hand the food itself was pretty good in my opinion, but I'm always a fan of anything spicy salmon related. Unfortunately I felt a little bit ripped off because of how small the portions were. I understand that fresh fish is expensive but for $10.95+tax I expected a bigger bowl. I was still a bit hungry after eating here and had to go to the grocery store to buy some snacks just to curve my appetite. 

Don't come here if you're starving ... unless you're ready to spend a lot of money lmao"}
{"text":"We came here to try out their poke bowls because we love poke from Hawaii. This isn't like Hawaiian poke though, it's their own take on it so don't expect the traditional Hawaiian poke. 

The fish was fresh, and we thought the portions were fine for the money. It's on par with poke in Hawaii cost wise (in USD), so it isn't a large amount of food, but fair. 

We got the big katuna and the ninja and enjoyed both. The crunch from the nuts were particularly enjoyable. 

All in all, we would come down here again for poke!"}
{"text":"Came here on a hot day, unfortunately the air conditioning was on but we couldn't feel any of it because the doors were open.  There was a fan by the door but it was on slow, barely felt anything.

I'd heard good reviews about this place and thought I'd check it out.

We got the Tuna bowl, it wasn't what I expected.  I think if I go back, I'd try the build your own just so I can customize it a bit.

The portion is small for $10.95 for a small, but I'm guessing the tuna is expensive.  Came with fresh avocado and cucumber.  My dining companion said there wasn't enough sauce, personally I felt it had too much citrus.

I'm giving it an extra star because the owner (I'm guessing it was him) seemed nice and apologized for the lack of air conditioning.  Beads of sweat were forming on my head while I waited for my food.  Yes, it was that hot!

Not alot of tables if you want to dine in."}
{"text":"I ordered the large Katuna, but with salmon instead of tuna. They measured out how much salmon they gave, which I like because it gives consistency and I pay for what I get. Though, I wonder if the regular and large size get the same amount of fish. Should ask if I go in next time. The bowl I got was plentiful, but it pretty bland. I was excited to try the ponzu sauce, but it wasn't good in my opinion. It didn't give any flavouring. I think next time I would try the ninja with spicy mayo. I was worried it would be too spicy with the wasabi peas. Maybe instead, I'll make my own next time. 

The actual bowl was made with care. The sushi chef was very meticulous in how he placed the ingredients. I liked the taro chips. The sushi rice had no flavouring so I recommend to put some sauce on the rice as well or provide some on the side. The salmon seemed fresh. The place is very clean and there is seating.

There was a bit of a wait to get my food, but the chef was apologetic. 

In terms of cost, I know other reviewers felt it was too pricey. I think it's not as bad based on other speciality shop pricing I've had. It's quite normal nowadays to pay $15 for a hot meal and salmon/tuna aren't cheap. The portion was ok for me, but I can why some people would think it's too small. To each their own!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends a few weeks back on a Saturday evening. The place was quite empty to be honest but the service was great. Me and my hubby shared a large bowl of The Ninja poké, oh my days, it was amazing, it was sort of like a deconstructed sushi roll but with super fresh ingredients and the salmon was superb. The wasabi peas added such a nice touch with a crunch. I'm definitely going to enjoy the next time I come."}
{"text":"Was super excited to try this place regardless of the reviews. Much to our disappointment, we'd have to agree with the other Yelpers. 

But first, let's give some points for the decor. Really liked the cleanliness and brightly lit space. Friendly staff too. Unfortunately, there were not enough seats for larger groups, but hey! It's a \"bar\" right? So we stood whilst eating--much more comfortable than sitting. 

Ordered the \"build your own\" option: mixed greens, half and half tuna and salmon, ponzu sauce, sweet onions, green onions, edamame, seaweed salad, tobiko, and roasted seaweed and added $1 for avocado. Ingredients were quite fresh and fitting to eat for the summer.

However, was very sad that the avocados in the bowl were tiny little cubes instead of what was advertised as reasonable sliced pieces. Nonetheless, was still tasty.

Liked this place, but unable to give more stars because $13.50 was way too steep for such small portions. It was good but not worth the value. May come back to try the Nachos? Hopefully will have a better impression by then. 

Feedback: The lights are suspended too low to the point where we were boiling. Maybe elevate them higher? Ohh! Let's not forget that we found it super great that all the bowls go into a recycling bin. Please do remember that Toronto does not recycle any black coloured plastic. Perhaps switch to clear plastic bowls to be environmentally friendlier? Good luck :)"}
{"text":"I'm amazed at how harsh people are being with Big Tuna. Have you guys actually been to Hawaii, the origin of poke? The price and portion size of the large poke bowl is comparable to those of Hawaii (on any island for that matter). It may be slightly more expensive here at Big Tuna, but definitely not as outrageous as people are proclaiming it to be. Especially since it's in Canadian dollars. 

While the idea of customizing your own bowl of poke is novel, it's also probably the reason why you hate your poke bowl. You don't know what it's SUPPOSED to taste like. Or what toppings are supposed to go on/in it. If you want a somewhat legit Hawaiian poke bowl, do your research. You will be pleasantly surprised that all the shit you're putting on it isn't what true Hawaiian poke actually has. Also, you're never going to get the true Hawaiian taste. You're going to have to go to Hawaii for that. 

I went with the tuna with spicy mayo, sweet onions x 2, green onions, and seaweed salad x 2. That's it. Just because you get up to 6 toppings does NOT mean you need to put 6 DIFFERENT toppings on. You CAN double up on the stuff that Hawaiian poke ACTUALLY has. People never blame themselves for creating bad combos. It's always the restaurant's fault. 

Regardless, you can do whatever you want, but it's just a suggestion. If you want good-tasting true authentic Hawaiian poke, instead of bitching about how it sucks, do your research on what should actually go with what. 

Cheers!

Overall: 4/5
Food: 4/5
Service: 4/5
Atmosphere: 3/5 - Tiny seating area."}
{"text":"Portions were very small for the price point. I paid $15 for a large poke bowl that was barely the size of my fist. Toppings were also small. I left the resultant $15 in the hole and still hungry. 

Also: why is avocado always extra?

All in all, I'm never going to Big Tuna again."}
{"text":"I've been here about five times and four of those times I've waited over a half hour for rice to be made or there is no fish. The food is so yummy which is why I keep coming back but pull it together. You've been open a few months now, haven't you learned to order the right amount of fish or when to turn on a rice machine? Why should anyone wait over a half hour for something that isn't even being"}
{"text":"it was a hot day when i went and i was surprised at how warm the place was. i wasn't sweating, but it could've been more comfortable. 

i had the ninja and the big katuna. the ninja tastes a bit like a deconstructed spicy salmon roll (which isn't necessarily bad). the big katuna is more traditional poke. both were fresh and tasty, imho.

the large bowl is wider but also shallower. to my eyes, the regular and the large were not significantly different in size. however, i don't think either size would be enough for an adult. as such, i'd concur with the other yelpers who've complained about a lack of value. 

the place is clean and nicely decorated. the servers are helpful. 

to be honest, the thought of a bigger/cheaper bowl of chirashi does make me reconsider coming again. however, i think poke is sufficiently different and big tuna is the only place i know that does it. i'll be trying them again."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed a bowl of poke here. Poke is one of my favourite dishes and I look forward to eating as much as possible on trips to Hawaii. The Big Tuna rendition is good although not as much variety as in Hawaii. My only complaint is serving size is small so you may want two orders. The tuna was fresh and all the flavours were there. Price was not bad and I will visit again.  Close to Bathurst station."}
{"text":"I have NO idea how this place only has three stars. My boyfriend and I are avid poke bowl eaters and have tried pretty much every bowl in the city. This is BY FAR our favourite. Always full of the best fresh ingredients. Great selections of toppings and sauces. Great ratio of rice/fish/toppings. I could go on and on. They really know what they are doing here and we have never had an \"off\" bowl (my boyfriend orders at least 3 bowls a week).  Also very prompt service for those hangry folks out there (me). So please don't listen to any of these negative Nancy's, this place is poking amazing! ;)"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and without a doubt the best poke in the city. Its family run and the staff are incredibly friendly. Highly recommend asking for the ninja but substitute tuna for the salmon. I'm addicted. They also play really laid back r and b and if you ask you can discover new up and coming artists. Bring your friends and introduce them to this amazing bloor secret. Boom."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Low quality, small portions and incompetent staff. Will not be visiting Small Tuna Poke Bar again."}
{"text":"I haven't had poke before so I was open minded to the experience. Firstly, I felt it was expensive for what I actually got. It is $10.95 for regular and $12.95 for large. The regular size is what I would consider an appetizer size and definitely nowhere close to a meal so don't think you will be satisfied after eating this. Get a large if you're going here, perhaps this portion will be better. Keeping in mind where they opened- Korea town/Annex neighbourhood, all of the restaurants offer great value so I felt this to be a little out of place.

I 'built my own' poke, you get a choice of white or brown rice, choice of fish, choice of sauce, 6 toppings. I got white rice, half ahi tuna half salmon, salsa verde sauce; my toppings were cucumber, edamame, tobiko, green onion, taro chips and lotus chips. Secondly, I asked for the chips on the side- ie. separate from the meal in like a bag or foil because this is my preference but they just stuck them on one side of the bowl (which is what they do anyway). I watched them make the poke before I ordered so this wasn't a trick question.

There was a LOT of rice and only a few pieces of fish so it was out of proportion. I would have liked a more salsa verde, the flavour was good but not enough. I ended up throwing out 1/3 of the leftover rice. 

Decor was nice, clean and simple with wood counters and bar stools. The food prep area was set up like an assembly such as Chipotle. So whether I had an authentic poke or not, I wouldn't know. However, I know that I did not enjoy it and felt ripped off for what I got."}
{"text":"Having been to Hawaii and indulging on copious amounts of poke, I was very excited to hear about this place opening up. After multiple visits and being turned away because they were sold out of poke (Plan your visit with that as a possibility), I finally managed to get a bowl. I'll get the negatives out of the way first, the size of a large bowl is pretty small considering the price and the amount of fish leaves a bit to be desired compared to the heaps of fish I can get for the same price point in Hawaii. Its a common criticism I see on here, but as long as you go in with that knowledge, at least your prepared. The tuna thankfully, is pretty good. However, if your one of those people trying to chase that borderline transcendent poke experience you had in Hawaii, your better off booking a flight back there. What you get here is a decent bowl of poke with lots of options to customize or pick a pre-set one. First time poke eaters will enjoy it but people who've had it somewhere like Hawaii will just have an acceptable experience. I would say my score reflects someone who's had excellent poke before but if this is your first time, I definitely think you'll enjoy yourself. Just don't go there if your starving, you may find yourself at a neighbouring establishment grabbing another bite."}
{"text":"The food was pretty alright, however the portion sizes were pretty miniscule given the price. Nice location, the service is friendly, however the large bowl was still pretty small."}
{"text":"Can't really comment on the food but went there twice. Once on a weekday evening and lunch on a weekend.  Both times no fish left."}
{"text":"Best poke by far!!  Me and my boyfriend are addicted !!! Way better then Kensington ! ( sorry dudes ) sizes are great and the build your own has a bunch of stuff to add cucumber noodles, ponzu sauce and taro chips are the best ! 
Also great owners for locals to make friends with and over all nice and helpful staff !!!"}
{"text":"A little pricey but nothing like it in the city. For a small bowl it's very filling and I love the wasabi peas! Everything they add compliments and creates a very flavourful experience :)"}
{"text":"While the place is a little hidden it turned out to be a real gem. Located on the south side of the street just a little west of Bathurst Street the awkwardly placed door which sits at a right angle to the street leads into a really small space. The decor is simple and straightforward with exposed brick on one wall and bead board on the other. Along both of the interior walls are bar stools and two counters to have some food. The serving area sits in the back section of the shop while a window lets in a little light from Bloor Street. While the place is small, the food was actually really delicious. They have a number of pre-made poke bowls, with marinated fish on rice or make your own options from a menu of choices. I had the Big Katuna while Mr.T had the Ninja salmon bowl. The food was the perfect combination of flavours for a warm spring-like night and will definitely become one of summer dinner options."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the hate is for because this place is pretty good! Having come from NYC, I don't know what authentic Poke is but I have tried countless of good imitation spots....and Big Tuna definitely is one of the better ones. I had a salmon based one and vegetarian based one...I am never the type to get healthy stuff but this was flavorful enough to make me think it's possible to go healthy. The workers are super friendly. Portion is a little small for the price but I believe that is the standard for good seafood. Space might be limited but it wasn't crowded when I went so I had no problem grabbing seats with my friends. Would return!"}
{"text":"Hawaiian poké bowl, never had one so this was the first time. Raw fish on top of rice, sounds simple but really difficult to make well. Being the first poké bowl place in Toronto, the expectations were high.

First impression was it looked like deconstructed sushi. Rice, raw fish, cucumber and sauce. Got to say, it wasn't that great. There's a choice of white and brown rice, which was a nice touch. The rice to topping ratio was very uneven. Lots of rice and only a few pieces of tuna and cucumber. There were many bites of just plain rice and sauce. The tuna didn't have that cool, fresh taste and texture, very disappointing.

Overall, unless there are some improvements don't think there will be a second time. They should have made it a bit more expensive and put more fish on top. Prefer eating sushi instead."}
{"text":"I rarely give one star, but after eating here (and I had a tea, and a biscuit for breakfast), I was not feeling well. The Tuna I think was off, not impressed with this place. The sushi rice, was just sticky rice without any seasoning. The Poke itself wasn't anything special. With raw fish it has to be as fresh as possible. Also the person taking cash wasn't the friendliest."}
