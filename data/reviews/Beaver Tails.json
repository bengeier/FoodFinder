{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! I was a little curious to really see what this concept was but both my Nutella beavertail and peanut butter Nutella beavertail were incredibly perfect! Craving one ever since I had it! Love!"}
{"text":"This place has 9 types, or a design your own. $4-6. I especially liked The cinnamon sugar and lemon one. This goes well with a coffee you can get on the corner."}
{"text":"I love it. Its a real Canadian taste. My fav is th banana & nutella. Whenever I see the Beaver tails truck, i go like"}
{"text":"Delicious! Ordered the skor beaver tail... the best decision I have ever made!   The tail was nice and soft but crunchy... The creamcheese sauce was sweet and the skor was chopped up into tiny bits.   It was $7, which I think is steep... So that's why its only getting 3 stars. The pop-up food craze is good, it allows you to try new things but it should be for reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The line was long but went fast. The dessert was so delish, I loved it! Def recommend it."}
{"text":"On my vocation in Toronto, one my of friend really wanted to try beaver tails. Beaver tails despite the name is a donut like pastry with a variety of sweets and topping. This is one of the few places in Toronto that sells beaver tails, coming here on the weekends you will find lots of free activities and entertainment.  I got the cookie and vanilla, the pastry itself was very delicious sweet. The toppings made it even sweeter then it was. The pastry itself is really good, would definitely recommend and come back again."}
{"text":"I've seen Beaver Tails numerous times but I decided to try it while Celebration Square had an event called \"SoundBites\" that had numerous food trucks.    I tried the Oreo and vanilla one and it was around $6.  I really enjoyed how warm and crispy the Beaver Tail actually is.  The flavour on the Oreo and vanilla one was quite good as well. It is VERY sweet and is very unhealthy, but it seems like a good once a year treat.  I would buy again.  My only slight complaint is that their prices stated don't include tax.  You kind of expect that when you see a pricing on a food truck, it includes tax.  It doesn't.  So make sure you have a couple of extra $.    Verdict: Pretty damn good."}
{"text":"Just had beaver tails from their food truck at the Toronto premium outlets.  Two guys were manning the truck, with one solely putting on toppings, while the other was stretching the dough and handling cash. Ummm ok, that's a put off, because there's so much food stretching and kneading going on there.  I was thinking of walking away, but I didn't, considering my fond memories of beaver tail at blue mountain and Quebec. I also just convinced myself that any germs will be eliminated during the baking process.  So I trooped it out and ordered the cinnamon version, which is also the cheapest version for $5.50 tax inclusive. They do not have the garlic and cheese ones, which I love.  It was great, but small and thin. I thought they were bigger?  Despite of the size, the beaver tail was awesome! So tasty! I could eat three at a time!   The ordering system is chaotic and at least three other people ordered the same as me, and for sure one girl took my order because she was behind me in the line. They should give numbers out, so you know when it's your turn.  Note that they also serve fries for about five bucks. The picture of their fries on the truck looked good, poutine for about 7 bucks and ice cream.  You can also get combo meals."}
{"text":"This is an awesome dessert.  It is a fried pastry that has different toppings on it.  On one beavertail it was cinammon  and another I had chocolate with banana flavor.  This was a food truck out side of a mall.  If I come back to Toronto I will definitely eat this again."}
{"text":"A friend was telling me that I needed to try this place when I arrive at Canada and I just thought it'd be sweet, and thick, but I was wrong! It's a thin fried dough with just the perfect amount of toppings on it! I got the Nutella with bananas and it was so good!"}
{"text":"i tried chocolate banana  it's enough to try once ;) i coudlnt feel cinnamon powder"}
{"text":"A little sad that these are not all around the city and I always have to find them at events. Please open up a store so I can get my fix!   I love how these taste. It is a fried piece of dough with various types of toppings. My personal favourite is the cinnamon, lemon and sugar one. I tried the hazelnut one and that one is great for Nutella lovers   4 stars because my purchased jumped up to about $9.50 with the addition of water. Felt a little pricey, but this is a classic!"}
{"text":"Killaloe Sunrise was GOOD, just under $5 for a flat, slightly crispier donut with sugar, cinnamon, & a fresh slice of lemon that you squeeze on top!  Not so great:  In particular for the truck that was parked outside the Toronto Premium Outlets was that there were soo many menu items that weren't available, especially the drink options.  Wait was like 10mins for order.  So not super quick!"}
{"text":"Beaver Tails Food Truck!!  I know it is just a fried dough tops with sugar and sweet.. but when it is pipping hot and smell so so good..... hmmm! Everything about diet, sugar level, junk calories, cholesterol level can all be forgotten!  Perfect carnivals and festival food.. and you can find the Truck popping in around the GTA at Ribfest, Food Truck Events and even on street in Toronto especially near the U of T's St George Campus.  Chocolate Hazelnut  ($4.42) is not overly sweet. I think mine is from a baby beaver?? I definitely can eat that all by myself in record speed!!  Carbs! Sugar! Happy Tummy!  Even my vegetarian friend can enjoy a Beaver Tail!!"}
{"text":"Beavertail tastes so good! The deep fried dough is crispy and sweet. I ordered chocolate banana flavor. The shape is so cute"}
{"text":"Something this simple shouldn't taste this good! It's essentially fried dough with toppings but it really hit the spot! Next time I'm in Canada I will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Amazing desserts...so simple...and yet smashed the taste buds right out of the park Great selection of toppings  Great combos  And great if u want a small portion"}
