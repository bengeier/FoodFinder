{"text":"PIZZA REVIEW! Delicious. Comparable to the pizza the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were so fond of.  Thin but not crispy.  Dee-licious."}
{"text":"Moved to Lakewood a little over a month ago and have ordered from here three times. It's that good! And the people working here couldn't be sweeter. Always cheerful and will help you with any questions you have about the menu.  I highly recommend the plantain slider. Yeah... seasoned pulled pork on a fried plantain. What could go wrong?"}
{"text":"Good food, just a little too pricey for a delivery place. I ordered a veggie taco, plantains, and a fruit salad and it ended up costing about $17. They were all delicious though. And delivery plantains? All about it."}
{"text":"My friend recently bootlegged a copy of the new Tarantino movie Django and invited me over for a viewing. I didn't think too much of the movie. He lives a block away from Jibaro so I decided to stop in. I recognized the name from the food truck and always heard good things. I tried the beef empanadas, rice and beans, burrito and pulled pork sliders. It was a Thursday so most appetizers are half off which is a great deal. That is why I went overboard. I had leftovers for about 3 more meals. I am happy to see another new business sprout up in Lakewood."}
