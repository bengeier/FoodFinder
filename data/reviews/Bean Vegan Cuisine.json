{"text":"Bean is AWFUL. If you want vegan crap food that resembles a sloppy southern barbecue - you've found the place. The food is fine, but has no nutritional value at all. If that appeals to you, great. But in my experience, most vegans are looking for some, I don't know, vegetables and fruit. No, jackfruit smothered in barbecue sauce doesn't count.   Honestly I can get over the food, though. It's decent if that's what you're into.   It's the POOR SERVICE that I can't stand. All three times I have been have been weeknights, generally empty, with one server milling slowly around the restaurant. All three times I have waited 5-10 minutes to be seated. All three times I have waited 15-30 minutes to receive a damn glass of water. Another 15 minutes to have our order taken. 30 minutes to an hour to get our food.  Drinks sometimes never came.  I am a server and can understand some slow service when it's busy, but this is just ridiculous and no way to run a business.   Bad service. Crappy food. Grimy facilities. Completely overrated."}
{"text":"Owner of the establishment was for a lack of better words rude, and refused to serve my group. Please do not attend nor support this establishment."}
{"text":"Hmmm....we really wanted to like this place but were pretty disappointed. Service was friendly but sloooow. Food was just not very good overall.   We started with the Queso Dip which was actually pretty tasty. I was disappointed wih the fact that the chips were obviously store bought (or vendor, as the case may be) but my wife later pointed out that the reason for that was likely to retain the \"gluten free\" claim on that dish, as the menu does have some fried items that are not gluten free, so there would be a cross contamination from the fryer. OK, I'll let them slide on that.   We then shared a salad with their \"crabby salad\", made from jack fruit, and a rice bowl with their soy pulled BBQ. Both were more sweet than savory and we didn't really care for either. We felt like we could have easily made either dish better at home, to be honest. There just wasn't much finesse in the preperation of either dish. Both seemed just sort of thrown together...not the kind of composed dishes that you hope for when you dine out.   I should mention that my wife is temporarily on a gluton and dairy free diet, which why we chose to dine here. I have tried to also adhere to that diet as much as possible, in order to support my wife, figuring it sure couldn't hurt...sounds healthy! Unfortunately, we didn't really feel like we ate all that healthy there, mostly due to the sweetness of the dishes."}
{"text":"I LOVE BEAN!! Everyone is friendly, service is great, food a fantastic! My husband and I go here often and recently brought a carnivorous friend and he loved every bite. We usually order the Queso and two Reubens. This last time I tried the BBQ Soy Curl Sandwich and Mashed Potatoes and my husband tried the Cheeseburger with Fried Yellow Squash. The sandwiches were amazing and the squash was the perfectly cooked. The mashed potatoes had a tad too much salt for my taste but my husband liked them. The vegan market they have is perfect! We have loved going vegan and have Bean to thank for making the transition easier by providing us with vegan versions of food we love the most."}
{"text":"Passing through the Charlotte area, I searched for a vegan place to have dinner. One restaurant was at the top of every search and article I read: Bean Vegan Cuisine.  I ordered the pimento cheese as an appetizer. The dish won over the two non-vegans dining with me. For dinner, I had the jalepeño burger which may have been the best vegan burger I've had in my 3+ years as a vegan."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town, loved this amazing vegan food.  Loved the cowboy burger and quesadilla and the Reuben and fried pickles.  Mac and cheese was meh but everything else more than made up for it. Truly one of the best burgers I've had in 9 years of veganism!  We got takeout and it was such a fun splurge.  Too full for dessert, but can't wait to get to it later!"}
{"text":"Want to trick your brain into thinking you're eating something healthy? Try Bean. I'm not a vegetarian, but I appreciate what vegetarian restaurants are doing with menus that don't solely offer salads. For my first time, I tried something safe, like a veggie burger, something they call a Good Burger (2 Burger Patties, special sauce, lettuce, Daiya Shreds, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun). If you are a McD's fan, then you will love it. It tastes a lot like a Big Mac. It's so good, you don't even miss the meat.   With a reasonably priced menu with nothing over $12, I'm looking forward to a return visit. The voyage there is another story. It's a dicey location off of Independence Blvd but any attempts at risking life and limb are greatly rewarded.    What else can I say about this place but Bean there, done that...and loved every minute!"}
{"text":"I didn't think this place was particularly healthy and was just trying to imitate burgers, tacos, etc. with vegetables and fruit. I was hoping for something a little more interesting and different."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to go to Bean for a while and finally made it there today.  Food was great - it is not exotic vegan food, but homestyle food - and it's really good.  I had the jalapeño cheddar burger which was great and my 3 year old had fried tofu fingers which he enjoyed.  They have crayons for kids with a picture they can color while they wait.  Their boxes for leftovers/ takeout are paper-based and not not styrofoam, which I really appreciated.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best vegan rubin sandwich in Charlotte! In fact, Bean has so many awesome menu items it often makes it hard to choose just one (or two). The mashed potatoes and kale are my favorite side items (so far). However there are many delicious side I have yet to try.  Bean is a great place for omnivores and herbivores to enjoy a delicious meal together. There is plenty of seating, a bar, and of course drinks. Though one thing they do need to improve on is their beer selection, they do offer a nice list of vegan wines."}
{"text":"I echo the review below by Jill V.  As a vegan, I'm always on the lookout for good food and vegan/vegetarian spots to fully support.  Having moved from Colorado recently, where there was an abundance of great options to choose from, I can say that I was disappointed that this restaurant represents most of the vegan offerings in Charlotte.  The restaurant was dirty -- I kid you not, there were multiple cockroaches in the bathroom the first time I went, and the food overall was pretty bland.  I've only had a few side dishes that I'd recommend -- the cauliflower \"wings\" & the collard greens.   Despite this, I've been back on a few different occasions still to give it a second and third chance (what can I say, I'm pretty optimistic), but I left with the same impression each time.   I'm sure I'll be back at some point because there's just a lack of vegan options in Charlotte, and if I ever have a better food experience there I'll be happy to update this review.  But for now... if you're looking for stellar vegan restaurants, you're better off heading up to Asheville -- they have some awesome food there!"}
{"text":"Some of the best meat loaf I've ever had and I'm not even vegetarian/vegan! Good friendly service."}
{"text":"Best place in town! I'm vegan, but I take all my omnivore friends here when they visit and they love it. Even my southern fried parents ask to go here when they visit me.   Make sure you don't skimp out on desserts either. You really can't go wrong with anything here!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE Customer Service!!  We waited for over 45 minutes for our food and it never came.  In that 45 minutes the waitress never checked on us even ONCE!  We finally got up and walked out.  Three other tables came in after us and they had already been served.  Luckily Charlotte has other Vegan options!!  Discrimination?  Maybe."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times in the past. Our recent and final visit was disgusting. Sometimes you eat at places that you know can't have an A rating. You want to support the \"small guys.\" Yet they didn't support or even respect us. Worse than finding a long dark hair in our food and having to pay for the fries that the hair was on because it was a side order included with the meal, the manager was extremely disrespectful and nasty. They thought the reason we were upset was because we didn't get a discount. We were upset due to the lack of respect and care the manager showed. She thought we were going to eat the rest of the food as if the hair didn't mess up our appetite. She said, \"Well, there wasn't hair on the other food.\" You may like dirty food but we don't. I worked in the food service industry and know that these folks don't care about their customers. It's pretty sad if you ask me. The manager is a reflection of what the owners project onto their customers in addition to the overall appearance of the place. It's all in the presentation. It's dark, dreary and did and filthy. We made a mistake going there but we have learned. We definitely won't return and hope that no one else gets treated the same way. Sadly though I know they will."}
{"text":"Disappointed with Bean. I have been eating here a long time. The food is always great and the service is good. However, my most recent visit was not pleasant and it will be a while before I come back because of it. We got there and were seated immediately. We ordered. Our appetizer came out about 10 minutes later. It tasted different from the many times we've ordered it before. Oh well. Then it took another 30 minutes for us to get our entrees. They were good. Our waitress NEVER checked on us to ask us how we were doing / if we needed anything. After we finished our food we were sitting there for at least 15 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. Our waitress was glued to the cash register. Finally another waitress came and took our finished plates. I had to ask for a box. Waited a few minutes, the check never came so we went straight to the cashier (our waitress had disappeared from the cash register). Our waitress never acknowledged us at all after she brought our food to the table. This was very poor customer service and showed a lack of team work. The food is good but the service is bad."}
{"text":"I was here and was so appalled from the customer service that I left immediately....very disappointing...and the food is great but with the attitude that I received from the male server,  Id rather eat twigs to keep up with my vegan diet....."}
{"text":"Best place around for your vegan junk food cravings.  All the delicious stuff that you're too busy to make at home can be found at Bean.  Plus they have a cool little store where you can pick up some chocolate, nooch, or whatever else you desire.  Great place to bring your carnivore friends too.  I love this place."}
{"text":"This place rocks.  Wife and I are from Ohio and rerouted our trip to Kure Beach thru Charolotte so we could eat here. We had sandwiches last night, and are having Saturday brunch before we head out.  The menu is all vegan and all good.  Can't say enough good about Bean Vegan Cuisine.  Did I mention the service is quick.  All good."}
{"text":"After we were seated a man came to our table and told us that we we're not allowed at the restaurant because I brought in a cup of coffee!!!! I dont think they can do the math. They lost 30.00+ ....over a cup of coffee!!! They should focus more on cleaning up the place, and custoner service! I will stick to  Fern restaurant for a REAL Vegan place!"}
{"text":"Just okay vegetarian/vegan joint. I was disappointed with the atmosphere and for it being a veggie place it was quite greasy overall. I'd recommend it for a casual healthy-ish lunch."}
{"text":"My grinch heart always grows three sizes when I find a place that serves tasty, affordable vegan diner food. I've been vegan for six years and for a while had limited options when I returned to my home town of Charlotte, but now I have Bean! My entire family (carnivores included) loves Bean. I had the tofu finger sandwich buffalo style, which was delicious, and we all split the fried pickles with vegan ranch on the side. We also split the blueberry cheesecake for dessert-- it was divine, and had no weird silken tofu aftertaste. Kind, helpful waitstaff, too. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Always good....Always satisfying.  Had to stop in today as I was craving my Bean favorite - the Mushroom Po'Boy.  If  you have not had one yet you are definitely missing out!"}
{"text":"My non-veg Husband and I love this place and look forward to getting dinner from Bean every time we visit Charlotte. Hubs seems unable to order anything other than the Good Burger. I've gotten several selections including - BBQ soy curls salad; crabbie salad, and the crabbie patty platter with grilled zucchini and tater tot casserole. My favorite is BBQ soy curls [right now], but the crabby dip/salad was amazing too! They now offer a small veg-friendly market or grocery area that is incredibly well stocked with unique items given the small space. Their desserts are tremendous too plus excellent selection of healthy beverages and \"healthier\" sodas. Cannot say enough kudos to accurately describe how much we love this place. A real treat and fun just deciding what to order.   Go and enjoy, or surprise non-veg friends with how yummy vegan food can be."}
{"text":"I would say they have turned this place around. The food is much better and I think they have worked out the kinks"}
{"text":"Finally went here after someone at school recommended it a few months back. I'm a new vegetarian and my boyfriend has always been a vegetarian and we both loved it. Satisfied my meat craving with the Bacon Cheddar Burger with the Kale Salad. It's a lot of \"fake\" meat I think but it's ok to have that every now and then. He got the Cheddar Jalapeño Burger with the tater tot casserole. Both side items were a little plain. Next time i'd love to try the pork sandwich that everyone raves about.  The server was very nice. We went at an off time and there were only a few people in there but was happy to see the diverse crowd (of race, gender, and age).   My only complaint is that the prices are a little high. I wish they offered a date night special like two for twenty or a Monday special along those same lines or something like that."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints, their Fried Tofu Fingers are the best. I just wish they would bring back the chocolate cheese cake"}
{"text":"I am an avowed omnivore, and I will never reconsider this nutritional decision. That said, I do eat all over the nutritional/dietary spectrum on a weekly basis, though vegan has never been on my food docket.  Until today.  I WILL be coming back here.  It was simply amazing.  The building is unassuming; the staff unpretentious and very nice; the food homey and delicious.  I opted for the eastern NC BBQ sandwich with a side of fried squash.  Being a huge BBQ fan (see my Midwood BBQ review), I have a high bar for BBQ.  I wasn't let down.  The 'Q is soy curls, and they are seasoned wonderfully.  It had that nice spicy kick that BBQ should have.  And dammit, I'm as full (or more so) after eating this great sandwich!  It came with slaw, and I added a little bit of mustard.  The fried squash was very delicate and tasty.  Very simple preparation: salt, pepper, breaded and fried.  I'm looking forward to trying something else next time I'm here.  Thanks, Bean!"}
{"text":"I had passed this restaurant a few times and decided to try it for takeout. I ordered the cheddar jalapeño burger on a whim and it was great!  From the fried jalapeño peppers on the burger to the French fries,  all was delicious!  As I change my carnivorous diet to a vegan diet,  Bean will surely help the transition."}
{"text":"A hidden vegetarian gem in Charlotte, NC. If you are in the area def stop in, I know I will next time in town."}
{"text":"My band is a very outspoken vegetarian/vegan band and were playing a show in Charlotte on Saturday, we stopped in at Bean with one of our friends from the area and were met with incredibly friendly and attentive staff who suggested a few different menu items for us to try. Everyone in our party loved out meals, appetizers, hell, even the coffee was fantastic. Being 800 miles from home and getting a meal that was by far better than the vegan restaurants at home. I had the fried tofu fingers and the pulled BBQ sandwich. Just fantastic. One of my friends had the fried pickles with his meal, being that I'm not a pickle fan, I tried one, I don't think I've ever had one that tasty. Kudos, Bean. Now if we could only franchise you up in New England!"}
{"text":"After living in Asheville for a while I was spolied by amazing vegan options. While in town waiting to fly out and visiting my family. I finally got to experience this new vegan resteraunt.  The meal was a bit greasy but AWESOME!!  I had a veggie burger with jalapenos and a great cheese substitute. I generally would skip a veggie burger since it is such a staple when you go out and are stuck deciding between a VB or salad. After the waitress suggested getting it. I gave it a try and was extremely impressed. This is Charlotte's Rosetta's Kitchen.  This place is well worth stopping in. The only complaint is the location. Not where I would look for a great vegan place and not the best looking outside but don't go by the outside."}
{"text":"Let's get one thing straight right off the bat:  vegan doesn't necessarily mean healthy.  But, if you are devout vegans, as we are, and you are willing to give \"healthy\" a holiday then this is the place to go.  You will not find this fare on the 'Please Eat\" lists of Ornish, Esselstyn, Barnard or Campbell but even a committed disciple of these plant-based-whole-food gurus will find their admonishing voices fading fast as he bites into, say, the Reuben or the Crabbie.  This is yummy stuff.  Make no mistake, nourishing choices can be made if one eschews the sandwiches and opts for sides like steamed kale and braised zucchini, but what fun is that?  Hell no, go for broke, order up some Buffalo fingers with that tasty vegan ranch or blue cheese, snarf down some decadent mac and cheese and polish the whole damn thing off with a carrot cupcake!  We started our slob-fest with an order of deep fried pickles.  These were a bit over the top.  The first few bites of hot, coated slices went down a treat but if one plans to tackle the whole order I strongly would urge that a bottle of Tums be kept close at hand.  Neither salt nor grease are spared in this dish.  A vegan market is attached but most of the offerings are available in your standard health food store or the Nature's Garden section of Wegmans.  One standout, though, was the sliced andouie sausage.  We took home a tub.  Dip one o' those pups in a jar of Mister Mustard and you got a magnificent morsel that screams for a swig of cold beer.  I'm not sure whether to fault or praise the Bean's celebration of deep-fried veganism.  I guess in the end I knocked 'em down a star but this food certainly beats the hell out of Twizzlers, another vegan empty calorie sin.  Go, have fun, eat like a real \"Murican\".  Tomorrow's steamed collards will taste that much better after the indulgence."}
{"text":"We tried out Bean with high hopes.  The service was friendly and helpful.  The food, however, wasn't very good.  We tried the fried pickles, the jackfruit tacos and the Buffalo fingers sandwich.  The tacos were awful.  They seemed to be lacking flavor.  The fried pickles were OK.  The Buffalo fingers sandwich was really greasy and did not have good spicy Buffalo flavor like it could have had.  Bean is serving so-so diner food. I hope non-vegans won't think this is standard vegan fare.  Vegan food can be fantastic and it can also be very refined.  I hope the owners will revisit their menu and make some changes before the place goes down the drain.  We definitely made our first and last visit."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian Bean hits the spot as to giving an entire menu of choices. The menu is full of a variety of \"burgers\" and I like their \"meat\" recipe.  I had my favorite dish the Bean bowl with teriyaki tofu fingers. Just the right amount of sweet and spicy. The bowl is layered with rice, pinto beans and kale. They put a \"ranch\" style dressing that I do not like so I order it without it.    The Queso Dip is great.  It is extremely creamy and full of flavor. I want this dip recipe.  Bean is a great choice if you want a vegan \"diner\" style restaurant."}
{"text":"Bean introduced me to the delicious and wonderful world of Jack fruit.  We started with the Crabbie dip appetizer, which I will now order every time I go back. As an entree, I had the reuben....incredible! My sister had the pulled Jack fruit bbq sandwich....unbelievably delicious. My friend had the ranch burger....delicious! The customer service was amazing. Our server was very helpful and answered all of our questions with enthusiasm.  My only complaint is that I don't live close enough."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good however it would be nice if they had some healthier options on the menu. The inside of the restaurant needs some major work. Location not great, would probably do better if it was not on Independence Blvd.   Overall, if you are a vegetarian interested in HEALTH, this is not the best option as a lot of the options are deep fried and I would suggest getting takeout instead of eating in the restaurant as the atmosphere is not great."}
{"text":"Like Cara C. I really want this restaurant to do well, and here's why: it's run by people who really believe in what they do, even though they may not have restaurant experience.  (One of the owners used to be a bail bondsman in a former life!)  Bean isn't much to look at from the outside, or the inside for that matter, but what they lack on the surface, they make up in heart and effort.   Note: I'm not vegan and have had very little experience with vegan food.   Food: A group of us went to Bean on a Saturday night, and tried a bunch of different dishes.    The appetizers of buffalo wings wasn't very buffalo-tasting, but came with a cool dipping sauce and celery. The sweet potato nachos were more like sweet potato fries with \"sour cream\" and \"queso\" drizzle and out of the two, we thought this was the winner.   Meatloaf: a bit spongy but the mushroom gravy made the dish hearty, and the grilled zucchini has a strong grilled/smokiness.  Big plus. The new side of the day was this tater-tot casserole, which had vegan sausage in it, and everyone around me thought it was the best thing we ate all night.   Tacos: This restaurant uses jackfruit in the tacos instead of tofu of seitan, and it's a nice alternative.  Think, the consistency of a firm mushroom, but not mushroomy.   FYI: Juicyfruit gum is jackfruit flavored!  We learned this from our server!  The desserts were excellent.  Don't get me wrong, their pumpkin cheesecake, carrot cake cupcake, chocolate pie are not like regular baked goods with butter and eggs...but given they're vegan, I found them enjoyable.  (The pumpkin cheesecake was the winner of the evening.)  Bottom line, Bean does a nice job, and very affordable.  An iced tea,  main dish and dessert cost me just under $20. If they can dial up the flavor on some items, and tweak some recipes, I see the restaurant sticking around for a long time."}
{"text":"After my girlfriend ruined my life by forcing me to watch a documentary that has turned me off of eating meat for the time being, I've been forced to explore the Charlotte restaurant scene for better vegetarian meal options.  Bean Vegan Cuisine sounded like a great place to try, since its name has \"Vegan\" in it...duh.  I was very impressed with all the options and I've never tried some of the meat alternatives they offer.  Seitan bacon??  I had no damn clue what that was, but if it tasted like bacon, I knew I had to load up!  I ordered the Jalapeño Cheddar Burger (with seitan bacon, of course) and my girlfriend ordered the Cowboy Burger.  My girlfriend and I did the typical splitsies with our meals, so I got to try both burgers.  While this wasn't my favorite non-meat burger, it was very good and I'd highly recommend giving this place a try.  The seiton bacon definitely had that familiar taste, but let's be real, bacon is bacon.    You may be asking yourself why I would only give a place 3 stars, when the options were great and the food was good - well, that's because the service stunk.  It took a while to be seated, food service was slow, our waters were never refilled, and it took FOREVER to get the check.  We were hoping to check out the little store they have in the back that sells vegan products, but we had a movie to catch and didn't end up having time after waiting so long.        At the end of the day,  I'm definitely going to give this place another shot.  If the service is improved, I'll absolutely update my rating.  I consider myself a fair guy.    On a side note - Writing this review is making me reminisce about the good ol' days when I ate meat.  I think I might have to pick a fight with my girlfriend on purpose tonight."}
{"text":"OMG, the Ruben!  I'm a veggie with a picky palette.  These guys know what's up!  Reminds me of the Laughing Seed in Asheville.  Why 4 stars?  The sides options are really really small for the price. Not worth it... Forget two sides and get another awesome sandwich!"}
{"text":"I really love that Bean is not far from my house. I love the service and the food. Its a place to go to if you want let down your hair and get out of the regular \"clean\" eating routine. I like the Bacon Cheeseburger!"}
{"text":"My mom and I tried this place and loved it. She is vegan and I am pescetarian. We had the breakfast bowl which had tofu scramble, cheesy grits, hash browns, sausage and carrot bacon... Oh and a biscuit! The carrot bacon was amazing! I have never had anything like it and it was similar to bacon. The server was very friendly and while you wait you can shop in their vegan grocery store! I must say I was skeptical at first because the location is in a not so good or transitioning area, but when we walked in and had breakfast everything changed. I would definitely go back and am going to soon!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Everything I've ever had here is flavorful and vegan. I'm especially fond of the \"burger and fries\" type combinations that will make you forget all about eating meat (if that's what you do). The Cowboy burger is one of my favorites though I've had several other burger or sandwich options that I've enjoyed in recent months. The veggie appetizers and sides are just as good, collard greens, squash, cauliflower, etc. are mainstays for me. It's my \"go to\" place in Charlotte for vegan food. It's as good or better than anything I've had across the country. Yay!"}
{"text":"Great experience at the Bean yesterday. If you go you MUST have the buffalo fingers. They are delicious! I could have eaten 2 orders of them. I had the jackfruit tacos and they were very good. Who knew that you could use jackfruit as a meat substitute? Bean does and they do it right. Wife had the bacon cheeseburger and she seemed to like it. The mock bacon on her burger tastes exactly like what I remember bacon tasting like (its been 7 years). My wife and I got the mac n cheese as a side (i know...I picked a weird side for my tacos, but hey...it's vegan mac n cheese) and we both did not really like it. It was too nutritional yeasty tasting for us.  The service was GREAT. Our server who was new (2 weeks working there...sorry we don't know his name), was very knowledgeable about the menu and very helpful with the decision process. Also, our food came out in MINUTES. So quick we were shocked and pleased.  Also, a really nice guy that we assume may be the owner came out as we were finishing to make sure we were happy. Nice touch.  Great experience, great service,and great food."}
{"text":"The food was very good, unfortunately with only 4 other tables in the entire place it still took about 30-40 minutes for the food to come out.  Our waiter was polite, but very unattentative. Never did a time check with us or explained why it was taking so long for only two entrees. Never came back to check on how our meals were.  Dropped the food off and came back when we were finished.  Will most likely come back again due to the lack of vegan restaurants, but if ticket times do not improve will not return after that."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, the food is delicious, you don't have to be vegan to agree. Anyway, my girlfriend and I have had some very sour experiences at bean. We LOVE the food and that is the only reason we come back, but the customer service is not so good, we have had to ask for the same things repeatedly and still don't get it. Sometimes when we get it to go we don't get napkins or silverware. It's disappointing because the food is good and we are paying a fair amount for it. Other than the customer service being mediocre the decor is sad. It can honestly make one depressed. We love bean, (the food) but the customer service is slacking, seriously last time we went (we are regulars) we waited over 30 minutes for our food. Don't get us wrong, the only reason for my three stars is because 1. Customer service is not the best and 2. The place is dad, other than that the food is honestly amazing and if they can apply the changes that many people have already suggested I think bean will make a great improvement and bring a lot more customers."}
{"text":"I am not a vegan, but a vegetarian.  I enjoyed the kit kat pie. I'm a chocoholic and this is a great alternative.   The barbecue tofu finger sandwich is very flavorful...must have. Staff is very friendly and food served hot and prompt."}
{"text":"If this place weren't such a dive I'd give it 5 stars! I love BVC and all of its yummy vegan food. I've been several times with vegans and non vegans and everyone loves what they had with the exception of the teriyaki cauliflower which was really salty. I'd passed this place a gazillion times and finally decided to stop in because as a new vegan (don't know how long it will last), my hubby and I were looking for dining out options. I have a family of 6; 3 vegans and 3 non vegans. Walking into this place, it's dark, older and a bit grimy but the food is great. They have a small store inside where you can buy vegan food and products to take home too. We bought some soy curls and some of their vegan ranch dressing which is delicious.  I've eaten the cowboy burger, the jalapeño crunch burger, the buffalo cauliflower(a must have), teriyaki cauliflower, deep fried tofu, fries(yum), tater tot casserole( wasn't a big fan of the corn in it), and their peanut butter crunch dessert to name a few things. If it's your first time I suggest you go with the cowboy burger, fries and the crunch pb dessert thingy, I can't remember the name. As an appetizer, get the buffalo cauliflower with ranch, awesome!  I wish they had a place like this in the Ballantyne area, it would be a huge hit but I will travel over to east independence to eat here. It's worth it. You might feel like bringing your cleaning scrub brush and some fresh, happy paint to brighten up the place but once you start eating a delicious vegan meal, you'll forget all about it.  Go to Bean! Eat the food! Vegan or not! It's delish!   That is all."}
{"text":"As an omnivore dating a vegan, I eat a LOT of vegan food with a wary eye. The food at Bean is AMAZING, and the service needs work. I hate a tofu scramble with mushrooms, peppers/onions, and \"sausage\" with a biscuit; split a plain waffle; partner had a brunch bowl. We loved the food! Biscuits were amazing, food was flavorful, and the tofu scramble was one of the best I've ever had. However, no one refilled our drinks in the 40 minutes we were there, and the staff seemed angry when we asked for waters and refills with our check. The space is pretty worn down and unimpressive, and inconvenient to get to. But if you want good vegan food, and you're okay being a little thorn-in-side with your waiter, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The Bean Vegan Cuisine in Asheville was amazing. We ate there on vacation with my kiddies. The staff are professional and attentive. The food was amazing. I had the Old Fashion Burger with chili, slaw, mustard, and onions. I could not wait to bring my hubby to the Charlotte location. We did not get the same level service or food. As others stated, the atmosphere is drab and the floor is sticky. Our food sat in the window ready for over 5 minutes. The waitress looked at it several times and walked past it to wait on other customers. I ordered the same thing again in Charlotte. The burger was good, just not like the one in Asheville, the fries and onion rings were not great. The batter on the onion rings was half on the onions and the fries tasted burnt or like burnt oil. We also tried the pimento cheese and corn chips It was good, maybe more like a vegan cheese dip or spread. If I had not been to the amazing location in Asheville, I might have given the Charlotte location 3 stars."}
{"text":"Environment/vibe:  This place gets a lot of business which is great that so many people are a fan of a vegan restaurant. I love the little sign on their table which talks about how eating plant based saves the planet & our health. As soon as you walk in you'll realize the lighting isn't pleasing & decor is super dated. But it was fun to see comic book covers on their wall & the Star Wars & marvel posters. No one is in uniform or has a name tag so it's awkward trying to tell who's a worker or not. It seemed like the hostess was in training (She was asking her coworkers a lot of questions about what to do next) she was so quiet we couldn't hear her, I'm not sure she greeted us. The staff seemed friendly, tried to smile even though they were very busy. My husband went to the restroom & advised me TO NOT GO IN THERE. He said they were super nasty. The tables seem to all be set up to seat 4, again they are dated. We sat right in front of the kitchen & where the staff is all working. I wish they offered booths or more comfortable & quiet seating/chairs.   Food:   I was a little thrown off at first because this place is known for being a vegan restaurant yet they offer regular drinks like any other restaurant as well as regular ketchup which is all made with regular sugar. Which in the US is grinned with bone char..? But okay, we can look past that & just order water. We ordered two small orange juices. They were just regular orange juice (Tropicana probably), i thought it was going to be something fresh or organic. I ordered the fingers & waffles (Fried \"chicken\" fingers & waffles with syrup) carrot bacon as my side & a extra biscuit to try. My husband ordered the brunch bowl (home fries, carrot bacon, sausage patty, tofu scramble, cheesy grits, biscuit). I was so excited to try the food! It's what's most important to me as well as service. We asked to keep a menu to look over what else they offered, we planned on coming back for lunch the following day & definitely ordering dessert! We wanted all of the desserts the offered lol. The waffle looked very underwhelming, very thin,  but it was the most delicious vegan waffle I've ever had! So buttery & soft, delicious! The fried tofu scramble was probably the most unpleasing thing I've ever tried.... I tried SO hard to like it. Chicken & waffles was one of my favorite things to eat before going vegan. I took several bites, added more syrup, tried to sandwich the bite in between the waffle.... still nasty. Had a hint of fishy taste to it which is stomach turning when trying to eat something sweet & savory like chicken & waffles. I should've stopped eating it once I took the first bite because I ended up feeling a little nauseous...  The biscuit was flavorless & dry, dry dry, not regular biscuit dry which is kinda what's nice about them. I put some jam on it & it was very tasty. It was like a guava or pineapple apple jam. I would definitely eat it like that again.  I tried a bit of everything from my husbands bowl & the scramble definitely needed more seasoning, the carrot bacon was good but more like carrot chip crumbs, the cheese grits were surprisingly very good & usually neither of us are a fan of grits, the sausage patty was very flavorful! We ate, were never checked on, & my side was never brought out. Once we were checked on I just asked for the check & told the kind lady (not our waitress) my side of carrot bacon was never brought out but I no longer wanted it & just wanted the check. She apologized. Our waitress then came out with the bacon & said \"I'm sorry about that\" & we said thank you but we no longer wanted it. She took it back. It was disappointing. We got our check... still charged for the extra biscuit $1.50 which in my opinion should've been taken off since they forgot my side. I didn't argue it because we just wanted to get out of there by that point.  We didn't order dessert because the tofu chicken made us both lose our appetite & the service was just ok.   Overall:  My husband said he liked his food but my chicken fingers were the nastiest thing. The food was okay, service was okay, the decor & setting was not good. If my husband insisted on trying them again I probably would only get take out if I did go again."}
{"text":"I'm a little bit sad with my visit to Bean last night. The flavors were not quite there. I had the Ruben sandwich with a side of Mac and cheese. The Ruben was okay but, it  tasted different since my last visit. The mac and cheese was awful. Dry, with no flavor. Just dry macaroni with some nutritional yeast maybe. They should take it off the menu if they don't  know how to make it.  The Tofu buffalo fingers also tasted different. The buffalo sauce was bland no flavor. The only thing I found good was the chocolate cake and I still have doubts it is completely VEGAN. I had cramps after eating it. Maybe they got a new cook? By the way service this time sucked. It took for ever our server for our order. They were just talking at the cash register and the table was dirty. Something was not right this time. It will take a while to return here. Oh, my the way vegan places do not use straws. They are very harmful to the environment specially to the birds, sea turtles and other marine animals. Stop giving out straws."}
{"text":"What a great hidden gem! I had the queso and chizo with chips for an appetizer. It had a little kick to it, nothing crazy and full of black beans.   I had the bean bowl with mushrooms for my entree. I really didn't know what to expect, but it was very good. Great large portion size and full of flavor. You have a choice to get it with tofu (4 sauces in can be tossed in) Or portebello mushrooms.   I got to try the Jack fruit tacos and they were amazing! I had never had Jack fruit before, so I had no idea what to expect. I love the texture of this exotic fruit. There is a great smokey-ness to this taco and a kick as well.   Service was great: filled up our drinks regularly and checked back with is often."}
{"text":"I'm so happy about Bean!   I came here for the first time yesterday and I'm totally coming back again tonight, ha! So, I have to admit I was skeptical about the location, it's on an extremely busy part of independence and the exterior is not exactly easy on the eyes.... but don't let that fool you.   First off, I was very impressed with how neat and clean Bean is inside. It could definitely use a little more decorating sense, but how sparkling clean the restaurant is (especially being an older building) was impressive.   Since bean is new, the menu is somewhat small, but you will no doubt find something you love. I ordered the Tofu Fingers Sandwich, which is the vegan version of a chicken fingers sandwich. You get the choose between 3 different flavors: bbq, buffalo, southern style. I chose the buffalo, which I loved. My boyfriend ordered the bbq style and added slaw, it was equally as yummy. The sandwich is $8.50 and includes a side. I chose the Northern Beans with Rosemary, soooo yummy. Slow cooked and full of flavor. My boyfriend ordered the grilled zucchini. Fresh, hot off the grill, and perfectly seasoned.   Bean is the perfect spot for comfort food for vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores alike!  EDIT: I can't stop coming here and ordering the BEAN BOWL with EXTRA KALE and SOY BBQ. I'm obsessed and it's the healthiest obsession I've ever had! OMG! Jasmine rice, steamed kale, red beans, soy bbq curls, and vegan ranch... perfection!"}
{"text":"Bean does vegan comfort food very well. It is an indulgence and hard to find something truly healthy on the menu, but if you're craving a veggie burger or peanut butter pie, this is your spot. The new market is something of a playground for vegans, with nearly every specialty brand you can imagine and the full line of earth balance products. If you're vegan and in Charlotte, this needs to be at the top of your restaurant list."}
{"text":"Amazing staff, amazing food, amazing store.  I highly recommend their mustard soy curls, I dream about them back in Jersey lol  They are also the only store I have ever been to that had vegan dupe candy bars. Just because I'm vegan doesn't mean I don't want milky way and Twix bars haha  Thank God for Bean Vegan Cuisine. I'm down in Charlotte a lot for business and I always make it a point to stop in!  Thanks for being awesome!"}
{"text":"Food was great! Service was pretty good a bit slow but not bad at all. Was hesitant due to review but it was totally worth it. Got the quesadilla and mac & cheese which was 10/10!! Mac and cheese had a bit of a nutty taste which I didnt mind at all and the quesadilla was so good. My s/o got the cowboy burger & fries which he loved! Would recommend if you're craving vegan comfort food"}
{"text":"I visited once before but decided to come by again, to order some of the famous bean cuisine. The cauliflower was a bit greasy, cheeseburger was amazing. However upon my leaving I was  heading to the restroom but decided to go to the store before hand. As I was walking passed the kitchen door there was a young black lady standing there blowing and digging in her nose directly on the dinning room floor. I was in awe and disgusted, all my food I just consumed wanted to come up. When I glanced back she was behind the swinging kitchen door still cleaning her nose. I don't know if she washed her hands afterwards, but I wont be back, that was completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"The employees are a little awkward... it's like they try to be a bit too friendly that it seems fake? Doesn't seem genuine and then they go to the bar side of the place and just talk and talk instead of checking up on the customers. Need better employees to be honest. The market for vegan foods is ripping you off, 5 dollars for vegan cheese when I could just go to Whole Foods and get it for cheaper!!! Would be nice if they gave it more of an uplifting look to the restaurant, looks like a Mexican restaurant that was bought out by Bean... Other than the employees and atmosphere the food is GREAT!!! The good burger is delicious. Would come back!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for quite some time. I love the kitchen.  They remember us when we come in. We have been here for Thanksgiving and ordered pies to go.   My favorite all vegan comfort food place.  Although the service today was slow and unattentive, I still love coming here."}
{"text":"Yum! That's all I could say. I had the Jackfruit carnitas tacos and the mac n cheese. It was so delicious. There is also a vegan market in the restaurant, its pretty cool. I bought some vegan snicker doodle cookie dough. The place is a little far from my house, but there were other things on the menu that I want to try; so its worth the drive in my opinion."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I LOVE the food at Bean. Despite the restaurants slightly lackluster appearance, the food is absolutely incredible. It's a vegan southern comfort food heaven, and it's such an awesome thing to go into a restaurant and not worry if what I'm eating is actually vegan. I haven't tried a menu item that I didn't love, and it is one of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte. Highly recommend any of the burgers, the BBQ jackfruit sandwich, the chips and queso, the pimento cheese, the bean bowl, and the tofu fingers! However the customer service is the reason I'm giving this restaurant a 3 star rating. There are a few regular servers who are amazing and very sweet, but bean staff need a briefing on dealing with customers ASAP.    When eating in the restaurant, expect to be there for 1.5 to 2 hours. Usually the wait for a table is excessive due to the consistent understaffing. Several times I've come in, only to wait 30-45 minutes for a table (mind, this is while there are several tables open, just not enough servers) then 45 minutes to an hour for food. Don't try to eat here on a Saturday, there are usually only one or two servers working the whole restaurant and service is unbearably slow, not through any fault of the wait staff. However its fairly common for water or drinks to be sitting empty and not refilled in a timely manner, and several staff over the past few years have been rude and inattentive.   When ordering take out, there is usually an issue. Once a staff member forgot to put our order in the system so we had to wait an additional 20 minutes for our food after called 30 minutes previously. We have also called before and the phone has been off the hook for over 30 minutes due to staff negligence. At one point we had placed a to-go order and after waiting almost an hour, my husband asked the manager who was at the counter politely how much longer it would be. He received a rude and aggressive response in turn. Our order has been put into the system wrong on several occasions and we have had to wait for it to be fixed. The \"pickup time\" is always 10-15 minutes, even on a night when they're slammed, but you'll still have to wait longer than that for your food.  None of these issues have been rectified in any way other than an apology. We have never received a discount for a long wait, never offered something in return for our food being forgotten, or never even offered a drink while we wait over 20 minutes for food. We at one point asked if we could have a discount or a complimentary dish due to the excessive wait time, but were told that staff didn't have the authority to do so, only managers (none were in the store at that time).  All of these issues don't outweigh the deliciousness of the food for us, at least not yet. We continue to eat at Bean because of the quality of the food, and the few staff members there that are friendly. However the customer service desperately need improvement. There is a large employee turnover rate, no repercussions we have seen for poor service, no emphasis on customer service, and we believe it comes down to management. We have eaten at the Bean Vegan Cuisine in Asheville several times and have never had an issue. The staff at that location have always been friendly, the service quick and efficient, and the restaurant well maintained. We would hate for such a wonderful local vegan spot to get a bad reputation and suffer for such an easily fixed issue. Management - please take this review seriously, as it comes from a loyal Bean customer who wants you to succeed but is very close to giving up completely."}
{"text":"A lot of vegan junk food with tons of processed vegan cheese shreds and vegan sour cream and such.  For a person actually looking for healthy vegan food this is not the spot.  Also the flavor of everything we tried was ok but not great.  This all would not be so bad if the cost was not on par with better more high end vegan restaurants we've been to with fresh ingredients.  Won't be going back"}
{"text":"Not good. Not one thing we had was satisfying. The buffalo cauliflower were sooooo greasy. I'll never come back. The waitress was rude  and it smelled"}
{"text":"The service has begun to be a bit faster. My husband tried Bean- he is after all the ultimate veggie-food litmus test- and... drumroll... HE LIKED IT!   Try the salt potatoes. They are incredible. So buttery and salty. They almost melt in your mouth. I dream about them."}
{"text":"Ok so the interior is a little sad and the waiters aren't the \"fake a smile\" type, but the food is good! I love the Good Burger. The mac n cheese is iffy. The sweet potato fries are excellent. It's worth a try!"}
{"text":"I'm torn on Bean. Most of what I've tried has been less than stellar (tater tot casserole was flavorless mush; cowboy burger was fine but not crave worthy).   But the jalapeño cheddar burger is one of the best vegan / vegetarian burgers I've ever had. The fried jalapeños are spicy and crispy and add a lot of great flavor. The vegan mayo and daiya cheese work perfectly (and although I'm vegetarian I'm not usually a fan of those items). And the burger patty is perfection. The total package is soooo crave worthy that I've been back 4-5 times in a month for it. This item gets 5 stars.   One time when i called for a to-go order, the girl forgot to actually place the order. So when I arrived 20 min later, i saw the handwritten order next to the register but the kitchen hadn't been given it. She told me she'd give me a discount for the inconvenience but alas - no discount given. It's ok, I'll still be back for that amazing jalapeño burger."}
{"text":"Disclaimer; I am not a vegan. I just like all kinds of cuisines, especially ones that include lots of veggies and make me feel good,  This place is really cute. If you are eating with someone who is not vegan and they want something fun (think: fried tofu fingers, fried pickle chips, queso dip, bacon cheeseburgers, etc.) this is the place to go. Raw, pretentious vegan food this is not.   i ordered the Crabbie salad, which was jackfruit mixed with Veganaise and Old Bay to make it taste like crab salad. The salad itself was great fresh greens and other veggies, and their Mega bean salad (which was probably my favorite part!). It also came with a tasty little corn muffin. Staff was super friendly, as were the other diners. I kind of wanted to try everything on the menu. Oh, they also had $4 glasses of wine!  Also, they have a small market in the back of the restaurant. You can get things like Dr. Macdougal's instant meals and vegan cheese.   The location is off a busy highway, not pedestrian friendly at all. Plenty of parking, though. Definitely a must visit for vegans, and tasty enough for those of us who are just open-minded."}
{"text":"My Go to for yummy Vegan lunch in a chill atmosphere and family friendly. I stumbled across Bean sometime ago but it took me a minute to review as I wanted to ensure consistency.  This place upon approach could come off as a \"Meh\" place but once you try the food you will be super pleased. The Bean menu is pretty entail with explanation in detail of the various forms of plant protein mentioned in various dishes.   The kids menu is cute and simple our son has had both options the cheese quesadilla and the Tofu nuggets. He enjoys both very well at the age of 2 and now 3.   My husband and I FAV burger is The Cowboy burger. My husband is more stuck on that burger than I am as I like to try other offerings (he had had that burger all 6-7 visits). I also enjoy the Jalepeno cheddar burger, the Rueben and the veggie quesadilla.  Bonus: You can shop Vegan  after eating at the attached convenience store. The store is stocked with items I order online due to the in availability of them for the most part in stores. I was so happy to see that I can purchase the items here.  Overall I enjoy Bean and the customer service which is hit or miss but when it's MISS there tends to be someone else that notices and try to assist."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try out Bean for awhile now since we've seen it driving 60 mph down Independence Blvd.  (I know what you're thinking: 60 mph down Independence?  What a joke.  It's actually more like 6 mph.  On a good day.)   Let's face it.  I'm never going to stop eating meat.  I don't overdo it, but I do like it.  Similarly, a few times a week, I do try to eat a veggie-only meal or three.  We had previously tried Fern in Charlotte and, while the food and service were good, it was quite pricey for a non-meat meal and the options seemed limited.    This past Sunday evening, we finally decided was when we'd give Bean a try.  Bean doesn't have the \"date night\" or \"night out on the town\" ambiance and decor that you'd want for a Friday or Saturday night dining experience, but it does have that weekday evening or lunch feel to it.  So, for us, Sunday evening was just as good.  We were relieved there were other people there dining besides us and were actually surprised at how much nicer the interior was than I expected (from the photos I've seen posted on Yelp).  Almost every table is a window table, and there's also a very long bar with stools where you can watch TV or enjoy looking at the posed superhero action figures on the shelf (woot woot!).    The next thing that I was pleasantly surprised to find was the number of choices on the menu!  There were apps, salads, sandwiches, and entrees.  And all of them were very affordable, even for dinner, making this a restaurant that you could come back to over and over again and it wouldn't blow your budget.    So many options sounded good, but for my first dining experience at Bean, I went with the Buffalo Tofu Finger Sandwich.  There were lots of Buffalo sauce-coated fingers and plenty of toppings.  Tastes like chicken!  The vegan Ranch dressing that came with it was very delicious, too.  It was similar to regular Ranch but possibly even better because of it's distinctly different flavor.  The sandwiches come with a side (there's a variety of side options), so I opted for the grilled zucchini, which were basically plain with limited seasoning but very flavorful.  Would I get this sandwich again?  You bet.  But not until I try a few other items on the menu that whet my appetite.   My partner ordered the Jackfruit Carnitas Tacos.  Upon seeing it on the menu, he first said, \"What's a jackfruit?\"  I replied, \"That's so weird!  If it's what I'm thinking of, I just saw and touched one down at the Super G International supermarket up the street!\"  It was about the size of a watermelon with a big green scaly skin.  We then looked it up on Wikipedia to confirm.  Sure enough, when the fruit is ripe, it's like a fruit, when it's unripe, it's like a meat.  Who knew?    We had just returned from San Antonio.  The Jackfruit Carnitas Tacos looked like the Mexican street tacos that we had just eaten on vacation.  I tried a bit of the \"meat\" and it really did seem meatlike and tasted similar to grilled chicken.    Everything seemed very fresh that they served, the restaurant was clean, and the service was friendly.  It was much better than I was prepared for.  For vegan or vegetarian food, Bean is at the top of my list for Charlotte.  It's delicious, there is a big variety of choices, and it's completely affordable.  It's not in the best part of town (and it's a little scary getting onto Independence Blvd after dining), but I highly recommend it for a healthy, flavorful alternative to a meaty meal.  It's good for small and big appetites.  (There's even brunch and kiddie menus!)"}
{"text":"I just love Bean!! Feels great to go to a restaurant that you don't have to explain anything (such as \"what a vegan eats\") to them. I really enjoy the jalapeno cheese burger...my guilty pleasure for sure! I would like to see them move to much more walkable area of town, the long drive does keep me from going as often as I would like to. But until then, I will keep going back for more delicious food....YUMMY!!"}
{"text":"Good food but bad service.We only ordered 3 items but the wait was too long. Then a rude waitress told us we couldn't eat to go food in the restaurant. I told her we almost left before getting the order it took so long. No apologies for the long wait, just a rude policy reminder."}
{"text":"Service is terribly slow, the restaurant floor is disgusting, and the kitchen is filthy. They say oh don't worry yours is up next... haha yeah right! I saw three other groups eat and leave before my order came."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Charlotte. All the food makes me feel so good after eating here. The old fashion burger and jackfruit tacos are my favorite."}
{"text":"My husband and I gave Bean a chance on Saturday, Dec 3, as a nice treat, since I am vegetarian. We ordered the queso and it was yummy. But, I ordered a tofu scramble and when it came out, I immediately saw a hair mixed up in it. YUCK! We pointed it out to the server, who explained the issue to the chef and asked for a remake. The next one arrived with a hair on the inside edge of the dish. I again pointed it out to the server and requested that she take it off my check, because I did not want it and was not ordering anything else. I told her the guys in the kitchen need to be wearing hair nets. She apologized and said it never happens, yet TWICE within a few minutes there were two separate hairs in my food. This likely happens more than she realizes. The guy with longish curly hair in the kitchen NEEDS to cover his head, because this is unsanitary! I am sure the health inspector would agree. We will never go to Bean again."}
{"text":"I can't believe how much my opinion of this place has changed. The customer service here is just bad. Every contact I've had with the owner has been unpleasant, and, in hindsight, I wish I had just walked out the first time. He seems like the type of person who would spit in your food if you look at him the wrong way. The restaurant does have a bad smell to it and the food seems to absorb it. The food here is hit or miss. I've had some great menu items and some really bad ones. I think my first review was based on the thrill of having an all-vegan restaurant in my area. I won't be back.   To anyone who did not receive something that you paid for and you paid with credit, I encourage you to dispute the charge with your credit card company. I also suggest contacting the Better Business Bureau with all complaints. It's happened to multiple customers, so it's definitely not an accident. He won't stop treating customers this way without consequences for his actions."}
{"text":"The customer service was horrible but I knew I what I was up against from looking at the reviews. I'm new here and trying to experience new things so I can be a vegan the food was ok but the cauliflower bites were awesome. But I cannot get over the lady there who was very rude."}
{"text":"Very cool menu.  I've tried the famous Cowboy burger and tonight the Roasted Portabella Bean Bowl. Both were excellent.  $4 house wine was not bad. I have to recommend this place for vegan meals.  Right across Independence Blvd from Ovens Auditorium."}
{"text":"Don't judge the surroundings: eat here, and have a fantastic vegan meal! Our group of four (not all vegans) tried multiple menu items and liked all of them."}
{"text":"When will businesses realize that no matter how good your product, if your customer service sucks it will ultimately be to no avail. Just ask Gateway computers. Their demise was NOT their computers, it was their lousy customer service! I am extremely disappointed in Bean and their LOUSY customer service. It takes a special kind of skill set to be a waiter/ waitress and the big guy at Bean has NOT been blessed with such skill set!   When my husband and I first visited Bean, we were excited. Upon first entering the establishment, we had to decide if we were willing to overlook the decor of the place in order to have a pleasant dining experience. We decided we would overlook the decor. It is much to be desired. Even though the decor is not the best, there is no excuse and no substitute for a little soap and water. The tables aren't the only things that need to be cleaned from time to time. The windows sills are dusty, and the curtains could use a quick wash in the washer.  With that said, as my husband and I have visited Bean quite a few times, we have noticed the customer service getting increasingly lax. There is nothing wrong in letting a patron know that you will be with them shortly. On one recent visit, the big guy walked back and forth about 20 minutes before he ever opened his mouth to say anything to us. He acted as if we were invisible. If you know that your weekend brunch is gaining in popularity, you need to have two waiters there at the very start!  Another thing that disappoints me with Bean is that you can ask the waiter for something and they forget, you have to constantly remind them what you asked for. My understanding is that Bean is a fairly new establishment, but if that plan to stay in business, my advise would be for them to  1.  Improve the decor 2.  PLEASE MAKE MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS TO YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE!  Unfortunately for my husband and I, last night was the tipping point. Very unsatisfied with the customer service and we will most definitely NOT be back. Very unfortunate indeed because there are so few vegan restaurants in Charlotte. If you can't respect me then you obviously don't need my money!"}
{"text":"I love Bean. My boyfriend is a devoted vegan, and I am a pescatarian (I eat fish/seafood but no other animal products). We have been here twice in the last month or so, and the food NEVER disappoints!  I will say, please be prepared to wait for a little bit for your food, as they prepare EVERYTHING fresh as it's ordered. I think the longest we have waited was around 45 minutes for our main entrees. However, our last visit was much better and a litlte bit faster.  If they have them on the special, PLEASE get the cauliflower bites. That is a meal in itself. They use giant florets of cauliflower, and batter them and fry them. I've tried making them at home and they do not compare to the ones at Bean!  The fried tofu sticks are AMAZING. They can use quite a few different sauces to tend to your desire. The fried yellow squash is always fantastic and crispy. I have tried the \"mac n cheese\" however it is very bland, I might skip on that next time. But all of the other sides seemed like they would be delicious and would compliment any sandwich.  My boyfriend always gets the Cowboy burger with the seitan bacon added to it, and he is always full and satisfied every time.  I do recommend this place to any vegetarian, new vegans, or long time vegans. It's a nice place with a huge selection of delicious food.  ALSO, they have an ALL-VEGAN market on the other side of the restaurant inside. So anything you might have a hard time finding at other places, please grab it from here! I use the egg-replacement powder in so many of my baking and cooking recipes that I used to use with eggs. They have a lot to pick from, grab a few things for sure, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I had the Vegan Bacon Cheeseburger.  Outstanding.   Seriously, I should have ordered another one to go.  Love the little vegan shop they have next to the restaurant."}
{"text":"So nice to have a diner style place to go that's completely plant-based! A little greasy, but definitely one of my brunch spot go-tos."}
{"text":"Must eat here!! Sooo good Had the quesadilla and a side of buffalo cauliflower. Too much food for one bit so good."}
{"text":"Delightful staff, both in the restaurant and in the vegan market.  I, too, am an omnivore, and have had some pretty bad experiences the couple of times I have tried to become vegan.  However, the food at Bean is incredible!  In fact, I can no longer eat cheeseburgers (vegan or otherwise) anywhere else because they are always a let-down compared to Bean's jalapeno cheddar burger.  My advice; try the jalapeno cheddar burger and definitely save room for desert (i.e. their cupcakes...yummmm!!!!!)"}
{"text":"Worst customer service Food already pre made. Fries were stale. It appeared there were just two people on staff who were reheating/refrying food and serving. Staff was slow and seemed didn't care about the water spilled on the floor. I wonder how they have got such good reviews."}
{"text":"I pretty much come here everyday. The food is incredible for both vegans and non vegans. I've tried most everything on the menu, and there is nothing that I don't like. The tofu fingers are probably my favorite. I love all the burgers! My new obsession has been the BEAN BOWL! This with buffalo tofu is magnificent! Trust me, you can not go wrong with this place! Don't let the appearance fool you, it is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Bean automatically gets 5 stars for being an all vegan restaurant that serves all the traditional non-vegan foods that I miss. They have modified versions of so many of my old favorites: buffalo fried tofu fingers, creamy ranch dressing, delicious veggie burgers, house made vegan cheeses, and amazing desserts. My husband and I stopped here for Sunday brunch and I was impressed with their brunch offerings. We started with the cheese plate and opted for the smoked cheddar, brie, and pepperjack. All were good but the brie took home the winning prize. I also had the chicken fried tofu and waffles. Wow was it tasty! They always have a long list of daily desserts and I don't recommend leaving until you've tried the kitty kat cake. Their description is it's like a kit kat bar in pie form.  Even though it's all plant-based, a lot of meals have fried components so it's not really the healthiest. I like to come here when I feel like I deserve a true American indulgent meal. We've also tested Bean out on some of our non-vegan friends and they all gave it a thumbs up. Bean currently ties for my favorite vegan place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I can't even begin to describe the pure deliciousness of this establishment! Mouth-watering, tongue salivating, tummy rumbling goodness!!! I've only tried two different options on the menu, and I already can't wait to go back and try more! Honestly, even if the menu only had those two options on it, I'd still want to go back!   My husband and I went for a Saturday lunch and ordered their Ruben Sandwich, and their Cowboy Burger. Both meals were an absolute delight. So full of flavor, so unique and delicious. They make their own vegan patties and veggie meat. They even make their own vegan cheese! Everything is so amazing! And the best part is they have their own vegan deli right next store, so you can buy the stuff, go home and make it yourself! Awesome!   Service was great, food was excellent, affordable and filling without giving you that bloated heavy feeling. Can't think of anything cons!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located on indepenindependence blvd. Not many people were there went for lumch. In need of a Jamaican Rastafarian chef. Food is bland."}
{"text":"Decent service.   Pretty unenjoyable burgers.  If you're into the veggie burger/soy fake taste you'll like it. I was looking for a fresh tasting black bean style burger. To each their own. Mash & gravy wasn't great either.   Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Wow. Can't believe that it took this long to check out Bean! Some may be a little deterred by the idea of veganism, but chef really puts an end to that debacle. The flavors here are incredible, innovative, thoughtful, and really fun.   We came in on a Saturday afternoon and pretty much every table in the main dining area was full. We sat immediately, however, and worked our way up and down the menu. The service was friendly and very helpful with some of the items I was unfamiliar with. We placed our order and had a chance to just hang out whilst waiting. It did take a while to get our food, but chef was the only person in the kitchen and seriously putting in some hustle. Fun to watch!   Our food came. DELICIOUS. I ordered the Buffalo Bean Bowl -- rice, kidney beans, kale, vegan ranch, and tofu coated in buffalo sauce. It was magic. So flavorful and all of the spices swirled around magnificently. We also ordered a side of the northern white beans, more kale, and braised cabbage. All were perfect. It's so nice when fresh veggies are flavorful in their own right and not slathered with butter or some bogus sauce. Chef really puts time into making each item flavorful. My wife ordered the seitan burger sans bun. It was wonderfully smoky and hearty.   Each of our plates came with a banana nut muffin. Holy cow! Those things are amazing! No dairy whatsoever.   We were stuffed. So much food and both of us dined for less than $30.   Where I love the food and the staff, I think the ambiance is a little droll. Think their still working on the space and trying to liven it up a bit. Some simple decor would be great. Also, the men's room is a little dingy. Not a huge deal, but think it just lends itself to being a dated building off of Independence.   Though a bit difficult to get into (hyperspeed traffic on Independence Blvd), it's totally worth it. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Oh wow, I could eat everything on the menu without first checking to make sure it was neat free, lactose free--even the cheesecake. I'm in heaven. There should be a Bean Vegan Cuisine everywhere!"}
{"text":"I don't often leave poor reviews, but I have been wanting to try this place for so long and was so disappointed. I want to say that if I were rating the staff only then I would give a 5 star review. They were all very pleasant and in my case not slow like some of the other reviews stated. The cleanliness of the restaurant wasn't great, the floor was definitely sticky and the walls could use a wash down but I wouldn't feel the need to give a poor review based on that alone.   My problem was definitely with the food. I ordered the jalapeño burger with a side of fried pickles and fresh fruit. I first tried the pickles. They were over salted big time and I suppose over breaded because it was more like I was eating a fried crisp and not so much a pickle. I usually will pick at something even if I don't like it but I couldn't make myself eat these. The portion size was very generous but I had to toss them out. I felt okay about that considering I still had my fruit and burger.  Once I bit into my burger it was a similar situation. Tasted like salt :(. The jalapeños were again over fried so I wasn't even getting a spicy taste- seriously just salt. I was still hungry so I really didn't want to toss this out but I could not eat it. And I can REALLY eat almost anything.  I wish that the portion size of the fruit had been as generous as the fried pickles because that was the only part I actually ate. It was delicious and fresh but an extremely small portion size. I am still hungry and seems I wasted 20$ on salt. But like I said the staff was nice. Maybe the kitchen was just having a terrible night?"}
{"text":"Bean is awesome, especially if you're craving vegan bar/fried food. The portions are awesome. Good luck trying to eat that many fried pickles (a perfect challenge to have). My partner absolutely loves the Rueben. The fried tofu fingers are good, but I personally prefer a meat substitute like tempeh to really soak up the wing sauce flavor throughout. The only recommendation I have is for a makeover of the actual space, which looks like an old abandoned Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Best vegan restaurant in Charlotte by far. Burgers are great, breakfast is great, and customer service is awesome. Love it. And you can find the best stuff at the vegan market that you can't really find anywhere else."}
{"text":"Forget that Bean is vegan. It's just delicious food served in a comfortable place.   My only experience with Jackfruit previously was an ex-girlfriend that was eating dried chips of it she fell in love with on a trip to Thailand. Our helpful waitress explained that Jackfruit has two different textures depending on how ripe it is. That is Jackfruit is meaty and perfect for shredding when unripe and is slightly sweet when fully ripe. When I say helpful waitress I really mean it. This visit was with a friend of mine with gluten & other food allergies. The waitress helpfully answered questions of what would be safe for my friend and what the cooks could do to change up what items. We ended up both ordering the Jackfruit Tacos, with slight modifications to my friends order.  When our food arrived and I had my first bite I was an instant convert. The jackfruit tacos were amazing just a wonderful spicing and such texture. The only clue I wasn't having carnitas was just a little hint of missing umami. Even then so many flavors were in this dish it is the number one thing you should order. I capped my my meal off with a peanut butter cupcake with chocolate icing that was also delicious.  Lest this review be one sided I went back for dinner a week later. This time I ordered the buffalo tofu finger with side orders of zucchini & kale. The sauce that came with it was almost a tzatziki but it paired well with the buffalo sauce that was spicey but not overly so and most importantly not oily. The only downside to this experience is their sweet tea isn't very sweet. However, they have have sugar in the raw & sweet n' low if you prefer your beverage equine fatal."}
{"text":"Hey! Back at Bean for their delicious tofu scramble.  It's not only good but also a great price.  I'm rating this visit at a 3 today because I'm noticing an annoying trend. Anytime I bring up or point out something undesirable about the meal I just get a bunch of excuses and then finally a sheepish I'm sorry with a hint of \"you can leave now\". It's so annoying! It's like people these days can't handle any criticism.... guess what.... that's how you get better and surpass all others.  But I guess Bean wants to stay mediocre....well help yourself.  Maybe it will take another Vegan restaurant to show them up...at this rate it won't take much.  Anywho...my rant is over.  The End."}
{"text":"Awful service. Our food came out cold, an hour after we ordered, and we never received our sides until we were ready to leave. The management and waiter didn't acknowledge our bad service, or complement the bad experience. Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Super friendly, good food, though I was expecting something different. The menu seemed like it was designed for people who don't want to eat vegan food (lots of fried stuff, \"burgers\", etc).  I ordered the Cowboy Burger.  It was delicious, but loaded with fried stuff, sauce and vegan cheese.  I'll try to go for healthier options next time."}
{"text":"The food was great BUT....  The service was awful. The girls seemed sweet but had no training what so ever. They barely checked on us, they just seemed super out of it. At one point they walked past my boyfriends food in the window 4 times. I'm a server, I get being busy, but there were 5 tables in there and 2 girls on. That's ridiculous especially considering me and my friend had our food and were half way through it. His just sat there for a good bit while we ate and didn't get to him till I went up to her and asked for it. What kind of crap is that? But they do have a BOMB vegan/gluten free market in the back that I got some great cookie dough and chocolate from that I highly recommend. I will definitely be back for the market and a to go order. I highly recommend the bean bowl with fried buffalo tofu fingers, or even the tofu fingers in any form. The vegan ranch blew me away and the flavor in all the food was awesome. I'm new to the vegan scene and so far I'm really diggin it.  -Sarah The Server"}
{"text":"I am not vegan but had a vegan friend in town who wanted to try Bean based on a good recommendation from another vegan friend. I love vegetables and don't eat meat at every meal but I'm not big on meat substitutes so I was a little skeptical.   I ordered the Buffalo Cauliflower, collard greens and fried squash. We also ordered the Crabbie dip as an appetizer. The crabbie dip surprised me. It was very good. A little chunky for me but after running a knife through my portion, I really enjoyed it. The buffalo cauliflower was very excellent and filling. I could not finish it. I loved the collard greens, I'm not sure how they did it but they had a bit of meat flavor like collards that had been cooked with pork. I didn't really like the fried squash. It was too mushy for me but that might because I didn't eat it right away. I probably should have gotten just one side because I was too full to eat the fried squash anyway. My vegan friend got the cowboy burger and really enjoyed it. Our other companion got the meatloaf, grilled zucchini and side salad and enjoyed everything. The meatloaf looked a lot more appetizing than other pictures I had seen on Yelp."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before and the food was amazing! (side note, eat it hot don't take it home if you live far.)  Anyways I took my aunt to eat here today, she's in town from Ft. Campbell Kentucky and she wanted to enjoy some vegan cuisine.  Before we got in the building, we looked for a trash can to throw away my 6 year olds Lunchable trash. All that was in the Lunchable container was cheese. But this establishment has no trash can outdoors.   We read the sign that reads, \"no outside food or drink\" . & Since nobody was eating the cheese & we were just looking for a trash can I took the container inside to look for a inside trash can.  While looking for a trash can (which there were none anywhere in sight) we walked all the way up to the counter to ask the manager where a trash can was located.  Before I could even open my mouth to ask him he looked at me and instead of saying hello he said, \"Hmph, (while shaking his head) ma'am we don't allow outside food in this establishment!\"  I kindly explained to him that I was looking for a trash can. He said it didn't matter, & that we can't bring anything in at all.  I was astonished! I explained to him that we just need a trash can! A garbage! (I said politely & didn't yell)  He said, \"so\"...it didn't matter.  I said to him, \"Sir it's only cheese!\" He said, \"We're a vegan restaurant.\" I said, \"& that's why we're throwing it out\"  He took the trash from me, but not after explaining to  me that they are a Vegan only environment  (which I understand) but it was freaking T-R-A-S-H ! LOL   Anyways, we finally ordered our to-go order ... & an hour later, after seeing people come in after us, sit down, and eat, tip & leave, we asked for our money back.  One stinking server came & asked our name for our to-go order. But she never came back with an update or anything!   The manager tried to explain to us that the people who we saw come in after us, had ordered over the phone & then just happen to see an open seat & sat down.   & that was the reason they came in after us & sat down & left before us.   But at this point, an hour later we dgaf, we wanted out money back.   & not once did they apologize, or offer a discount or a coupon.  The manager rude af! I'm NEVER eating here EVER again!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Vegan paradise! Killer Reubin sandwich with Kale side.  She had BBQ sandwich with Mega Bean salad.  EXCELLENT! AND EVERYTHING IS VEGAN! Grocery store in the back. Very Cool! This is my new favorite restaurant in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Ooooohhh you're sneaky Bean. You really are. You fooled me. Okay, you didn't because it's in the name. I know you're a Vegan joint, but you almost fooled me. I mean your cheese tasted like cheese. Your burger had a consistency that made me forget I wasn't eating meat. The fried jalapenos really threw me off. I may just have to become a Vegan.   Sike nah, that's not happening, but I'm seriously considering it, with all the shat they put in food these days.   I'm typically open to eating all types of food and I had good reason to eat at this place with my brother (who is vegan) in town.   That jalapeno burger was extremely delicious. I seriously thought I was eating real cheese. They used Daiya cheese and my brother couldn't believe it. He said he's had the cheese before after purchasing from maybe Whole Foods, and when he opened the package, he said it smelled like fart. No lie.   I don't know what Bean did but they did good.   The crunchy jalapenos was a nice touch and I'm not exactly sure what the patty was made out of but it had similar consistency to a bean burger. I wasn't too thrilled about the fries. Not my style. And the \"ranch\" was okay but was definitely better after mixing it with the ketchup. I think it just needed more salt.   My brother thoroughly enjoyed his burger. He talked about it all weekend. Like, ALL WEEKEND!   If you're vegan, you'll love this place and if you're not, like me, you'll love this place."}
{"text":"My friend and I visited Bean on a Saturday night around 6:30pm. There was a small crowd of people which seemed to get busier as the night went on. The service was great and the meal didn't take too long which I had previously heard was sometimes slow since there is only one person cooking. My friend and I shared the special, the firecracker bowl, which featured spicy tofu, rice, beans, vegan cheese, kale and fried jalapenos. It was large and we had leftovers even with the two of us eating off of it. We also shared the jackfruit tacos. They tasted similarly to fish tacos. Also a very good choice. We decided on the mashed potatoes with gravy and tator tot casserole. Both excellent sides. I most likely could eat an entire meal of the tator tot casserole although it's not offered as a meal. Next time I may just order 3 small bowls of it because it's that good! The strawberry cheesecake was a nice way to end the meal. They had lots of dessert choices and many chocolate options as well. I was very full and really didn't need dessert but clearly that didn't stop me. We will be back. Thanks Bean."}
{"text":"Long overdue review of Bean. I went here with my toddler a few months ago--wasn't sure how we would be received, but turns out this place is very kid-friendly and has excellent service. Great children's menu, and I ended up going with a plate of veggie sides for her. Despite the positive jackfruit reviews, I decided to try the Jalapeno Cheeseburger: ding ding ding!! We have a winner folks. This burger is dee-licious. So much so, that my toddler took it from me (sans jalapenos) and munched on it exclusively instead of her sides. I also ended up purchasing another cheeseburger to go to bring to my husband. I've come back to Bean a few times since then, but always get the Jalapeno Cheeseburger because it really is that good. My only nits for this place is that their kale side needs something more (like sesame oil) to give it a kick, and I wasn't a fan of the nutritional yeast flake Mac and Cheese, although my former-vegan husband claims it is delicious (acquired NYF taste, I guess). But, for the main meal, the jalapeno cheeseburger is not to be missed."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!!! My husband and I were so excited to find a vegan place to eat but before we even had a chance to get something. The owner began to lecture us for giving our baby SOY based FORMULA inside of his restaurant. Saying that outside food and drinks are not allowed in his restaurant. We tried to explain that we were just trying to feed our child while we ate and he told us \"you can't feed your child in my restaurant\"! Obviously we will never come here again. The owner was a complete ass to us and had no problem being extremely disrespectful to his guests. There are so many vegan options in Charlotte that I don't understand how a place like this could even still be open. The building looks like a shitty hole in the wall from the outside and the interior isn't much better. If we didn't look up vegan places near us we would have never found this place because it looks like a nasty restaurant building that was built in the 80s."}
{"text":"Super great!!! Food was out of this world for vegan!! Would definitely go back!! Wish they delivered."}
{"text":"Solid 3 stars for an overall A-OK experience and here's why:  My husband and I have been wanting to try this spot for a while now. As you may know, vegetarian/vegan spots are seldom found in the area and when we heard about this place it made the short list of new places to try.  If you want to come here, you really have to work for it. While it's on a popular street, getting in (and out for that matter), takes some aggressive driving. People fly down Independence!   The food is okay. Someone else compared one of their burgers to a Big Mac. Umm, I guess if that is what you are doing for, that's a compliment. If you are a vegetarian/vegan who is looking for some \"fast food\" type dishes, this will definitely foot the bill. However, if you are looking for the raw, healthy, and clean food, this is not the place. I was hoping for a vegan restaurant with culinary skills that I could not recreate at home. Rather, the ingredients were similar to products you could buy at the grocery store. Don't get me wrong, it was still good, but something I could make with the help of Morningstar. Even the grilled zucchini was good, but easily something I steam or sauté for dinner already. Perhaps they were wanting to fill a market for the vegan eaters, but not focus on specialty entrees, and if so, they did just that.   While the food did not win me over, the service did. The servers were very friendly and had such kind dispositions. The environment is clean, bright, and they took an older building and turned it into a nice diner-type of space."}
{"text":"With much anticipation a friend and I decided to try this place out. Based on the location, I should have known the experience was going to be a-ok. The restaurant was not very welcoming as far as the décor. Once seated, I noticed that only two servers were managing the entire restaurant. I guess they can't afford a big staff by the looks of the place. We ordered the Crabby Dip appetizer which wasn't all that good and wouldn't get it again. I ordered the veggie burger and my friend had tofu tacos I think. Mine tasted pretty plain, lacking flavor and spice. My friend said he thought his was just okay. Surprisingly, they also house a small grocery inside with many of the same ingredients found on the menu along with many other vegan alternatives. The food was interesting. Interestingly strange to the palette. All in all, a good experience and wouldn't mind going back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"I can't remember if I reviewed the Bean, and if not- i'll be glad to do it again :) I've been trying to find more vegan restaurants in Charlotte- something different and not too overly pricey. I saw the Bean randomly while on Independence and laughed b/c I got a kick out of the name. Weeks later I thought I'd give it a try.....So glad I did. The menu is tasty- and very different. I had seen mixed reviews on the beer and wine (or if they served it) and indeed they do serve both. I hope to see more selection of (in particular) beers, but the Shock Top hit the spot. I decided to try the Jack Fruit Tacos- DELISH! The blending of flavors was excellent. A few of my friends tried some other options- like the \"bacon\" Cheeseburger and the \"wings\"- both delish. It's definitely in an odd spot and a 'destination' spot, but don't be fooled by the location....it's a great restaurant to try! Our server was polite and attentive. A tad $$$ for the servings- I can't say it will be a regular spot for me, but will make it a special occasion spot. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Bean is the best vegan \"junk food\" restaurant. Their quesadillas and burgers are amazing. The salsa they make is a little bland and the fried squash could also use some salt but overall, I recommend it. The kit kat cake is to die for. It's one of the best chocolate desserts I've had, vegan or not."}
{"text":"As an omnivore who lives on mostly processed foods and takeout (which I am sure affects my tastebuds), I am kind of torn as to how to base my review.  I like meat and cheese.  A lot.  However, I think if I chose the vegan/vegetarian way of life, I believe this place would be a staple for me, as the dishes seem to be well thought out and prepared, I just wasn't a really big fan.     Off of Independence, we were trying to figure out what it used to be - we both thought maybe some sort of Mexican restaurant.  Early on a Saturday, there was plenty of parking and plenty of seating, though a constant ebb and flow of customers was nice.  It's either going to be a pain in the ass to get into or out of, depending on where you are coming from or going to, so be prepared for your GPS to give you a fit.  My food: Queso dip with tortilla chips:  As another reviewer stated, this is served with bag chips (and not very many at that).  The dip itself has a healthy portion of black beans and is flavored quite well, but my deadened tastebuds were missing sodium and maybe a little more spice.  It was quite tasty though and I would order it again if there.  Served with a fresh tasting salsa that I enjoyed.  I felt it would be improved with Velveeta (I am a pig, I know). The Reuben:  From some other reviews, I thought this was going to be a hit.  It was well prepared with grilled bread, just the right amount of kraut, 1000 island, and there may have been some sort of \"cheese\" in there.  The meat, while a meat texture, didn't really have the corned beef taste to me.  It was fine, but I (as a person who really likes corned beef) wouldn't order it again. Tater tot casserole:  There wasn't a description of this, so I am not exactly sure what makes it up.  I think I recognized potatoes, green peppers and onions.  There was some type of \"sausage\" (?) in it.  Under seasoned, I would not order that again.  My dining companion, who had their BBQ sandwich before said it was very good, ordered that again.  She kindly offered me a piece of the \"BBQ\" that fell off of her sammich and it was DELICIOUS.  I absolutely should have ordered it.  The sauce on it was smoky and tangy and the texture of whatever meat substitute is used with that was spot on (seriously).  I had wanted to try Bean, and if I had a buddy who wanted to go there, I would definitely go and order the BBQ sandwich (though I don't know what side?).   This is an excellent member of the Charlotte-dining scene.  As the George-generated Yelp saying goes - I ate here and I didn't die - 3 stars!"}
{"text":"I hadn't heard of jackfruit prior to dining at Bean. I still don't really know what it is, but it is an incredible meat substitute and the texture is amazing! I ordered the BBQ sandwich and I'm sure the jackfruit could have fooled a carnivore. My side of grilled zucchini was perfectly cooked and seasoned. My husband ordered the vegan reuben and wasn't as impressed with that meat substitute, he really liked my sandwich better.   I'm looking forward to trying the jackfruit tacos when I'm in the Charlotte area and I have a larger appetite. Their vegan desserts look tasty too."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this place out during a trip to Charlotte. The reviews sounded promising. However, my experience proved otherwise. The workers lack any experience on how to properly service their customers. They lack knowledge of the menu, and failed to properly put all of our orders in. The manager there was also rude and offered zero assistance in helping to rectify our order. A large percentage of vegans choose such a diet as a part of a healthy lifestyle. Regardless of the sign on the table that describes a vegan diet as a way to promote good health, the majority of the items are fried and completely lacking nutrition. I've been to steak houses that offered better tasting, healthier vegan options. I would NOT recommend this place if you're looking for a delicious, healthy vegan meal."}
{"text":"After I went vegan, naturally I had to try every vegan restaurant in town. The food was good, atmosphere good, cost good, service good.   Nothing amazing, but very thankful this is here! Definitely would return if we were in that part of town again."}
{"text":"The only major complaint I have is the location as far as access. If you're coming from Uptown, Bean is located on the other side of E. Indy so you'll have to pass it on your left and take the next exit to make a loopty loop to hit it. Food is good and fairly priced for being all vegan. I went with their fried pickles for apps. Served with their homemade ranch dressing and for my entree I went with their Crabbie Patty sandwich served with their version of A Thousand Island dressing. Their fried pickles were little on the greasy side than I'd prefer but hey, it's southern style so I guess it's expected. Crabbie Patty was great and filling. Staff is friendly, good service and knowledgeable. I will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"I'm won't hide my bias, I'm a rabid carnivore. I tried Bean and was honestly nervous and very skeptical beforehand. But my fears were unwarranted, it's not nearly as odd as I imagined, but don't go in expecting a miracle. Their BBQ sandwich with tofu curls, (whatever that is) was very good. And for about half of the sandwich I could barely tell that it wasn't actual meat; their sauce, bun, and tofu complete a remarkable illusion. Kudos on their diverse and creative menu.   I also tried their mac and \"cheese,\" which was obviously tasted a little different than authentic cheese. It wasn't bad, but when you've grown accustomed to the real thing and are used to gluttonous amounts of delicious, melted cheddar.... well then nothing could be an adequate substitute.   As I said, I've come from a pro-meat perspective, and for what Bean is, I think it's excellent. The quality is there, they have a good drink selection, and the people are friendly. But I have to grade them from my eyes, and with so many restaurants to choose from, and with my uncivilized palette, Bean is just average to me."}
{"text":"I am writing this as my husband is on his way to Bean to get takeout.  I have eaten here about 10 times.  It really is delightful.  Although I am not a vegan (I'm a vegetarian), I find that the food here really hits the spot no matter your food orientation.  My husband, an omnivore, loves the BBQ and Tofu Fingers, but his biggest obsession is the chocolate cake.  He said it is the best he's ever had, and he is a picky fellow.  Para mi, my love is the Jack Fruit Carnitas.  The texture and flavor balance are perfect, in my opinion.  Plus you get two delicious sides with it!  And to top off the great food, the staff are some of the nicest people.  They are always so accommodating and helpful.    Tips:  there are a lot of gluten free options, they serve alcohol, and make a mean Thanksgiving dinner.  Go now!"}
{"text":"This place is okay. I'm split on the food some things are great others just okay. The Mac and cheese may taste a little weird to someone who's not used to nutritional yeast. I think it's a bit over powering.  I've been here 3 or 4 times, they're easy to get to but the place I small so keep that in mind for rush hours.  I love that they have a little store where you can find great vegan products you might not be able to get anywhere else.  The reason I gave it 3 stars was because every time I've gone the service hasn't been great, they take forever to check on your table and sometimes the food takes a long time to come out."}
{"text":"Bean is probably my favorite vegan restaurant ever. We lived here for over a year before finally getting down there and the only regret I have is not going sooner. The location is terrible to get to but so worth it. The burgers are by far my favorite thing on the menu, I usually rotate between the cowboy burger and the old fashioned. I always get fries for the side and I have to be honest these are some of my favorite fries in the area, so good. We also always start our order off with the tofu fingers, a mix of the teriyaki and buffalo. We also like to order to go from here as well and it's always ready super fast. If I ever move from Charlotte bean will be a restaurant I def miss!"}
{"text":"Bean may not look the part from the outside but the food and menu selection is great if you're vegan. Even if you're not you can enjoy a ton of menu items without missing a beat. I've now visited three times and only once was there an issue. My wife had a hair in her wrap and although we understand that happens sometimes, it shouldn't. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, however unless otherwise burned again I will continue to eat here when I am in the area. The market is awesome as well for some hard to find vegan ingredients. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"It is with great disappointment that I write this review regarding Bean Vegan Cuisine.  I attempted to contact the restaurant to speak to a manager before writing this review; however, the attendant who answered the phone informed me that, \"There are no managers, only owners, and the owners are not in right now.\"  She also didn't know when they would be in.  So the only option I'm left with is to voice my dissatisfaction on social media.    I've been a vegan for over 20 years.  I moved to Charlotte from Atlanta in 2011 and always enjoyed going to Bean Vegan Cuisine for takeouts and to dine in.  I live in Albemarle now and don't always get a chance to visit as often as I used to.  So when a friend decided to meet me there for lunch on Wednesday, May 10, 2017, I was excited.  When we walked in, one of the servers (perhaps one of the owners) sat us down at a table.  He didn't take our drink orders, but no problem.  Though my friend is health conscious, he's somewhat new to veganism, so I asked our server to recommend the best or most popular veggie burger.  He told us and then walked away to give us time to decide.  When he returned, my friend had a few more questions regarding the carnitas tacos dish.  At this point, the server seemed impatient and made the comment, \"Then you're not ready to order.\"  My friend replied, \"I'm ordering now,\" and the server responded, \"No, you're reading the menu and I have other people to serve.\"  My friend looked at me in total astonishment at the blatant rudeness and said, \"Let's go?\" And I said, \"Yeah!\"  So we got up to leave.  As we're walking away, the server then says something to the effect of:  Okay, fine.  In my opinion, he could've kept that.  When we got to the front door to walk out, I was so shocked, I turned around and held my hands out with my head to the side and said, \"Really?\"  The server threw his hands up and shrugged as if to say:  I don't care.  We were BLOWN  away!    I understand that sometimes customers can take a while in deciding which dish they'd like to order; I'd imagine that's quite common at any restaurant.  But I've never seen anyone treat customers so rude when we did nothing wrong and hadn't even been there long enough to be considered troublesome.  All the server had to do was choose to be tactful by explaining that, well, it looks like you have a few more questions and I'll be glad to help once I take care of another table.  That would've sufficed.  Actually, there were a million different ways he could've handled this situation, but simply chose to be short, curt and outright rude.  My friend and I were so perturbed at his behavior, the only sense we could make of it is that he simply didn't like us from the moment we walked in.  What other reason could there have been?  We are still deeply offended by the major disrespect we received from this owner/server at Bean Vegan Cuisine and have no intention of subjecting ourselves to this type of treatment at their establishment ever again.  How unfortunate!"}
{"text":"Idk if it's necessarily the healthiest option but if you're craving just a good vegan burger this is the place. Plus there are so many different options which as a vegan or vegetarian you don't normally get. It's essentially vegan junk food but it's really good. I've even heard several non vegans say they love the place."}
{"text":"Was excited to try an all-vegan place and not have to worry about what I'm eating. My friend had raved about how good it was.  Were seated quicky but took forever to be asked if we wanted water...  Ordered fried pickles. The serving is very large, and they were good. I liked the ranch a lot.  For my meal, I had the reuben and a side of fruit. Reuben tasted weird (yes, I take into consideration that it was Seitan) and wasn't really appetizing. The fruit had background flavors that didn't taste normal.  I left feeling heavy, tired, and super thirsty - all things vegan food shouldn't leave you feeling.  In all, paid $20 for a not-so-great meal."}
{"text":"It is such a relief to go out to eat with my vegan friend and know there will be tasty food that she doesn't have to hunt for on the menu.  It is ALL good.  If you can, save room for dessert."}
{"text":"Tofu, Jackfruit, and \"cheesish\" are words you will find on the menu at this place.  Don't let that steer you away! The food here is awesome!!!  I'm not vegan, but I LOVE the food at Bean!  The chili is amazing, the grilled \"cheese\" is super flavorful, and the veggie sides are all delicious.  My current favorite is white beans.  They're creamy and perfectly seasoned.  I've had a burger here, too.  It was awesome!  Don't go here expecting great decor.  The place is clean, but as another poster said, they're a small local business trying to make it work.  The decor is a work in progress.  The staff are really awesome people, and the owner is the chef and can commonly be found in the kitchen working his magic.  Give this place a try.  I can't imagine anyone leaving disappointed."}
{"text":"The cowboy burger was wonderful! Perfectly satisfied my craving. Was a little salty towards the end, but it's to be expected. I was not a fan of the tot casserole; would recommend a different side. I plan to visit BVC again!"}
{"text":"As soon as you enter you feel like you stepped into someone's kitchen rather than a high end restaurant. The mom and pop feel is complimented by the Super friendly staff and great service. I've ordered a few things from the menu and it has always been great!  The cheeseburgers, rueben are exceptional and am always looking for an excuse to eat here!"}
{"text":"I've never written a restaurant review in my life but I will take the time to share my experience at Bean Vegan Cuisine. I'm no food critic, however I am a vegan and some places aren't fit for the vegan restaurant industry. First off, let's not ignore the sanitation rate; afterall, this is a Vegan Cuisine. During my first encounter I noticed that a lot  of the servers spent more time on their phones than checking on their tables or tidying up the place. They will literally pick your food up after toying with their cell phones. My server wasn't conscientious, she stayed on her phone majority of the time and was gossiping to the front house manager about a table of customers. I couldn't help but overhear the two ladies because they didn't bother lowering their voices to share their rude comments. I minded my business and waited until they were finished to ask for more water. By the end of my meal, I honestly think my server forgot about me so I went to the register to pay for my food and left. The food was decent but not as good as I expected and definitely not worth the wait. Sometime later I thought to give it another try but I got the same results. I won't share the entire experience but I'm convinced that the reviews on this place has to be older and I can imagine this place turnover rate or even management. There seems to be a majority of minority workers there and I do not see an issue with that being that I'm of the same however I can sense that the workers are poorly paid which could be the reason for poor service and lack of cleanliness. Being that it's a small owned business, I don't understand why it needs more attention but in some cases, owners and workers become lazy. I tried this place twice and both times I felt terrible afterwards. A bad case of itis, nausea, and sluggishness which is a very rare affect after eating vegan food. I would definitely put this restaurant in the category with fast food and recommend that they retrain their servers and raise their sanitation score before I eat there again."}
{"text":"I had the meat loaf, greens and Mac and cheese. Everything was pretty good. I also tasted my husband's cowboy burger and onion rings which were pretty good too. Will definitely eat here again when passing through."}
{"text":"Good n greasy! This place is for vegans who enjoy southern cooking, comfort food, and guilty pleasures. The fried pickles with ranch is a must get!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Charlotte progressive, who would have thought? The only thing i dislike about this place is the location. Not easy to get into and a lousy neighborhood, (scary)! Otherwise a great time and great food!"}
{"text":"I keep craving Bean's food but I can't ever have it because I live two hours away. :(  COME TO CHAPEL HILL. You have the BEST vegan food ever! I love you."}
{"text":"Had an appetizer of buffalo tofu fingers that tasted so good! I ordered the jalapeño burger and fries (delicious), and my honey had the cowboy burger with braised cabbage (delicious). This place was definitely worth the road trip. Taking dessert (him-cheesecake, me-mini carrot cupcakes) to go!"}
{"text":"Maybe we just had a bad experience...but myself and two others came to this restaurant and did not have a good experience. None of us really enjoyed our meals... all very heavy and didn't feel extremely \"home made\". None of us would be interested in coming back. The service was good."}
{"text":"I can no longer hold back any stars. I constantly want to eat at Bean. I love their jalapeno cheddar burger and buffalo tofu options. I love the fried jalapenos that come on the burger, and usually a good amount surrounding the sandwich as well. It's all the deliciousness of my old favorites without the unnecessary carcass. They now even have a cheese plate which is worth a try. My only complaint is that it's out on Independence and not right next door in Southend."}
{"text":"What to say about Bean...simply the food is good! I have only been once so far and I had a Jalapeno cheddar burger and the tofu fingers but I was very happy..and so was my tummy! I will say, I was not a fan of the décor on the inside...personally, and I probably wouldn't eat inside but I would take out any day of the week, I am excited to try different things on the menu too, especially breakfast because their breakfast menu looks amazing! If you are iffy about this place I say give it a try! I was not disappointed at all :)"}
{"text":"I drive pass this place every day never thought anything of it because I'm definitely not vegan. Decided too stop now today because of all the good reviews I had the steak hoagie sandwich and the queso dip. Both was very good will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Bean is very good for what it is. I enjoyed what I had, but admit I would have been happier with a little cheese! But then I am not vegan."}
{"text":"They forgot to put a cheesecake I ordered in my bag. Mistakes happen but I'm disappointed that a manager hasn't called me back after I left two messages in two days. The food is mostly fried unhealthy vegan cuisine, something I shouldn't eat anyway."}
{"text":"The fried cauliflower bites are amazing! These are the teriyaki flavored ones with the homemade ranch- SO good. The mashed potatoes and gravy was not quite so good, very runny and flavorless. Overall though, this restaurant is amazing and has a huge variety, a must go if you're vegan, or even if you aren't there will be options for you on the menu. Great service as well!"}
{"text":"Amazing vegan fast food. I have been coming here so often, amazing burgers, my favorite is the Jalapeño burger and the King burger. Must try the fried squash, Mac and cheese and chilly!! And be sure not to leave before trying the Kitty Cat cake!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not bias or exaggerating when I say this food is soooooooooo savory and filling ! My non vegan friends came with me and they had no complaints & they are picky !   Can't remember what burger I got but it was the first option on the burger section add mushrooms !   Very unimpressed with the Mac & cheese but that's honestly expected because I have not had any good vegan Mac yet !"}
{"text":"This place is vegan heaven. They have everything from burgers to salad; they even have vegan desserts! The staff was friendly and the place is always packed. Very clean & even had cute merchandise available for purchase.  I had the Cheesesteak; the bread was soft and everything came out hot & fresh.. pretty big size too.  It took a little long but it was worth it. I got red kidney beans and rice as my side (could use a little more seasoning but not bad.) I also ordered fried pickles as my appetizer- super salty!"}
{"text":"Loved the king burger... Going back for the Reuben  It is amazing how they an reproduce your favorite flavors in a vegan format but it really really works!!  My wife and I have had several enjoyable dinners with zero regret and will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"My fam (whose not vegan) and me (a vegan) love their collard greens, tater tot casserole, Good Burger, and Bacon Cheeseburger. Whenever we are in CLT, NC visiting we have to eat at this place. The service was also good, friendly. Thanks and bring a place near Raleigh NC soon please."}
{"text":"WOW!! I was in Charlotte for 2 days attending a concert at the PNC Pavilion and did an online search for vegan restaurants. Happy to report that this place is phenomenal! I absolutely love that they offer 100% vegan options! I ordered the \"Crabby Patty\" sandwich with macaroni and \"cheese\" on the side and was positively blown away. Additionally, my server was super friendly and attentive. I will definitely return the next time I'm in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"The stars are for the food which is the most important part. (especially when your a Vegan and your options for eating out are limited . We had fried pickles with ranch very delicious could add more flavor to there ranch however. I had the Crabbie Patty Sandwich which came with a thousand island dressing. The sandwich was the best Vegan sandwich I've had! It needed more flavor some garlic, salt and pepper would have me there daily! Didn't really get crab cake from Patty but it was great. I also had onion rings they were crispy but needed more salt as well. Servers are comfortable in there positions and must not desire tips so I won't be doing that until the service improves."}
{"text":"Tonight my best friends and I came to get dinner as it is our first time here and we are SO stoked on everything!!! Food is great, our server is this cute little blonde girl who is absolutely the sweetest thing and we could not be happier with our service and experience:)"}
{"text":"Being new to vegan diet, I looked forward to trying Bean.  The food and service were quite pleasing, and the prices are reasonable.  It was a little tricky to navigate to Bean, given its location on Independence Blvd, but this was surmountable.  I had the bean bowl with mushrooms, and it was delicious.  I am fine with the spartan simplicity of the interior, and am very encouraged by the enthusiasm of the proprietors for vegan cuisine.  I learned about seitan, a protein comparable to tofu or tempah, but derived from wheat instead of soybeans.  Plan on a tasty meal at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. And they have a store for you to eat vegan at home as well. The only reason I gave it four stars is because dine in service is not impressive. The host and waitress both times I dined in with my family were not friendly. It took almost ten minutes for someone to take our drink orders the second time. And they automatically add gratuity to your bill... For poor service??? Otherwise the food is awesome. I suggest take it to go."}
{"text":"I'm giving The Bean two stars based on cleanliness. The floor was unbelievably sticky, there was a puddle of liquid under our table and the cabinet on the wall by the sink had catchup or some other red sauce splattered on the front and side. The atmosphere and food was good though. I had the fishless sandwich, which was quite delicious. I wouldn't recommend the Cowboy burger for those who are not seasoned vegans. The Sauce was overpowering and the texture was off.  If the restaurant was given a thorough professional cleaning I would go back."}
{"text":"Loved this place. I'm a long time vegan, and I've visited a number of vegan restaurants through out the country. I'd have to say that the food was amazing. The atmosphere wasn't 5 star, but it was cozy and familiar. Actually I felt like I was eating an amazing meal in my parents basement in the late seventies.... So I give it bonus points for making me nostalgic for childhood."}
{"text":"As a new vegan, I was excited about the prospect of eating at Bean! I had won a bet with my boyfriend so he was (grudgingly) coming with me.  We arrived at 5:30 PM on a Friday evening and the restaurant was surprisingly full. The crowd was incredibly varied--not just the crunchy granola types I was subconsciously expecting. The outside of Bean is rather hideous...beige with no windows like an industrial complex. The inside was not memorable except for a colorful chalkboard advertising the specials. Bean also offers a vegan store which has several amazing vegan products that are otherwise difficult to find in the South...even at Trader Joe's or Harris Teeter.  After discussing our options with our waitress', she recommended the \"Fishless Fish Sandwich\" and the jalapeño burger. I was super disappointed by the burger...I had expressed to my waitress my raging dislike of all the vegan cheeses I had tried, but she insisted that THIS vegan cheese (Daiya cheddar) was great, and that you could barely taste it on the burger. That was not the case! The dirty-feet cheese taste overpowered the burger, which was mealy and bland.  On the positive side, my meat-eating boyfriend loved the Fishless Fish Sandwich! It was made with Gardein products, and these are now a staple of his transitioning diet. I am grateful to Bean for giving me the opportunity to introduce him to vegan cuisine.  For our sides we had French fries (good) and breaded squash (greasy but good).  I will be trying Bean again, because there are not as many vegan options in Charlotte as I would like. I will keep you updated as to how it goes in the future!"}
{"text":"We just stopped in. It's 8:34. The resturant only has about 3 tabled full. The hostess asked us if we were dining in and the sighed as though that upset her. Then she said \"well, just to let you know it woukd take about 45 mins for your food.\"  I'm pretty sure she just didn't want us to eat here since they are closing in a half hour.  Will never come here again."}
{"text":"Rolled into town with my pals and came straight here. The vegan philly was so good! I had a bite of the buffalo tofu which was equally as delicious. And the zucchini!! The mac n cheese was super bland though.  The ambiance is different but the servers were awesome. I'll definitely be back when I'm in town again!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Philly cheese hoagie and mac 'n' cheese side. Both were flavorful and hearty portions. I was able to take some home for a second meal which is a plus. Also, the buffalo cauliflower was amazing! I enjoyed everything including the customer service. I wish this restaurant will have much success in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I recently went to Bean to find out what all of the hype was about and was over joyed!!!!! The decor of the places is quite simple but the food is fantastic for those who think that since this is a vegan place that the food must be bland they are wrong!!!! Nothing can be further from the truth this is good vegan comfort food! I tried the crab patty sandwich with the tater tot casserole and it was fantastic. The sandwich was made with Jack fruit and I could not tell that it wasn't meat!  The tater-tot casserole was a nice switch from just fries as a side like most eateries. The next day I went and tried the pulled barbecue sandwich with the mega bean salad and just about lost it because it was so good. Check this place out and support it Charlotte needs more vegan/ vegetarian places.... P.S. Even if your not vegetarian or vegan you will love this place."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant so much that it's my fave in the whole world. They have the best food ever. I'm truly impressed. Thanks for serving good food u guys."}
{"text":"Friendly, amazing food--I love the batter on the fried tofu and cauliflower--so good! I wish there was a Bean in Santa Cruz, CA where we live. Crazy that we almost passed it because it seemed like a dump on the outside next to the freeway but we saw a lot of cars out front and glad we didn't pass it up."}
{"text":"This my second time here this week ...they are packed that's a good sign. OK so this is my first vegan burger and it is so good! Bean Vegan cuisine for the win!!"}
{"text":"I just stated my Vegan journey and this place was really good. I ate there for lunch. and it was poppin. I had the King Burger and Kale. it was Hittin!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times and EVERYTHING I have tried is phenomenal. When I first switched to a vegan lifestyle I had not yet rid of my connection to comfort foods, so Bean helped to fulfill my cravings. I have gone here with non-vegan friends and all of them have enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Oh, Bean. Such a special place to both my husband and myself. We discovered Bean shortly after they opened, and thank goodness we did. We quickly realized that Bean was the missing ingredient in our life, and became regulars right away. The owners of the establishment and the staff were quick to welcome us into their extended family, and made us feel at home every time we walked through the door (which sometimes was 3-4 times per week).   This is the place to go when you're craving a good, home cooking style, comforting meal. I see that other people mentioned a lack of more diverse 'healthy options', but to me, that's silly. You are eating vegan alternatives to animal products, so first of all, that makes them 'healthier' options, and secondly, there are plenty of places where you can go get a cold pressed juice and a quinoa salad. Bean has an amazing selection of delicious diner style items, and there are plenty of healthier options as well (salads, bowls, sides of veggies). In my opinion, life is too short to not enjoy the food that you are consuming.   My absolute favorite things are the Firecracker Bowl, the King Burger, and the Buffalo Tofu Fingers. The specials are always amazing as well. Bean quickly became a regular part of routine that we did not want to go without.  If they didn't exist, I'm not sure how well we would have done maintaining our veganism when eating out (we probably would just not eat out). Charlotte does not have many places that offer vegan food, and it was such a blessing to stumble upon a place we actually craved and wanted to frequent.  We recently had to move away, and not a day goes by where we do not dream about walking through those doors and sitting down for, what is still, the best damn vegan food we've ever found. Our new city has nothing that even remotely compares, and I greatly look forward to stuffing my face full of delicious Bean fare at my next opportunity."}
{"text":"Delicious vegan food. The buffalo tofu fingers were excellent. So was the burger. The wait time was typical for a Friday night dinner, nothing crazy. Service was good."}
{"text":"Wife and I had dinner there and loved it. She had the veggie burger with salted potatoes. I had jackfruit(texture and body of oyster mushrooms) tacos, the best kale ever, and rosemary beans. Well prepared and simply presented. Comfortable like only East Charlotte can be, think Lupie's Cafe or Crazy Fish. Forget an vegan hang ups. We will eat here often. This is just good food."}
{"text":"Warning... this is NOT your typical healthy vegan restaurant!  We eat here for more vegan \"junk food\" like fried pickles, pimento dip, burgers, meatloaf, mac n cheese etc.  This is an occasional splurge that is totally worth it! A couple things have come out a little on the bland side which is easily remedied with some sriracha. They also have a large breakfast/brunch menu and I really enjoyed the bbq grit bowl and the tofu scramble."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend swore up and down that we had been here before..... definitely not! I would have remembered this place for sure! We have been traveling more and more down the road of the vegetarian and vegan life and I can wholeheartedly say this place is a place that makes it miles and miles easier. We started with the \"chorizo\" queso dip and it was delicious! I love cheese! I had little faith that I could be so easily deceived but low and behold they did it with ease (I did not mean to make that rhyme but hey it worked out)  We then moved on to main courses I had a burger that I think was called the cowboy? maybe? I cant remember I am so bad about that but it was a patty with fried jalapenos and cheddar daiya cheese on it...outstanding!  I got fried onion rings with it with a side of bbq and vegan ranch which both were great compliments to my burger and rings. My guy got the brat and red beans and rice he said both were great which they must have been as I was not extended an offer to try them :/ ....... I also love the fact that they serve beer and wine! Parking is good if you can make it into this place as you have to make a life decision about how fast your going to pull into the lot as its right off independence hwy and unless your the luckiest person on earth you probably will have someone going 80 and riding your tail like theres no tomorrow. But! the food is most definitely worth the risk of careening into the lot so you can taste this vegan goodness! A must try for vegans, carnivores and everyone in the middle! Cant wait to go back!   side note! they also have a small market in the back where you can purchase many of the things they use to make their menu items which is so super awesome for the novice vegan or anyone that simply wants to incorporate more of these delicious vegan items into their meals at home! CHECK IT OUT!"}
{"text":"We finally made it here,and it was definately a great decision to stop by and check them out. The staff and proprietor were very welcoming.. The market,offers a good selection of some of the best packaged vegan products. We had a brief conversation with the owner/manager andshe brought my vision of the market to fruition. I love and share the owners enthusiasm for future plans! We grabbed a quick bite which was delish and filing. The quesadilla w/pico was flavorful and delicious with the perfect texture.! And if you have ever had the delightfully crispy(burnt) or the very chewy elastic textured experience. You know what I mean. The fried tofu fingers w/blue cheesish were yummy! So unlike, the usual greasy,soggy and gummy ones you unfortunately are served at other places. Wish we had more time to hang and try more..but definately plan on returning! They have a few dishes that include Jackfruit, that I can't wait to try. And a restaurant that builds their own vegan or veggie burgers I have to bow down to it makes such a difference. A friend says they are yummy like mine, so I really can not wait. The Bean bowl sounds so good and looks scrumptuous. I have to bring that home and eat it all day it quite a bit!  The location,for those of us who don't move without the power of pollution. I guess it is fine, still alittle round about to get to, depending the direction you make your approach from. Walking, eh, I'll get there! Right now I am 15 minutes from my side of Independence almost directly opposite the Bean. But! Have to go all the way around I am told. About an hour or so? Like I said I'll get there sooner or later .The atmosphere, a little dark, a work in progress, perhaps. The building reminds me of the Greek diner we practically lived in back home. But the vibe feels like home, sort of faux bohemian, almost like the village back in the day, a comfort zone serving up healthy cuisine with open arms! I hope they will be around for a while!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been customers over the last couple of years and I'm sad to say that the quality has slowly been going downhill recently. I don't know if they're under-staffed, or struggling with new chefs, or just experiencing some growing pains, but the last several times we have gotten food at Bean, our orders have either come out wrong, our food has tasted different than before, or we have had to deal with painfully slow and disorganized servers. I will say that, if you catch them on a good day, they serve up super tasty vegan comfort food! They introduced me to jackfruit and I'll forever be grateful to them for that. I really hope the kinks get worked out soon."}
{"text":"Since my last rating, I tried Bean again. Looks like they have updated the menu somewhat and I had a really good BBQ jackfruit sandwich with a side of collards. Service was a little lackluster, but nothing that couldn't be overlooked. The decor is extremely dated"}
{"text":"Great food! First off, the location was definitely weird. But the food was really good and I am not even a vegan"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Vegan or not, you can't hate eating here. Their food is so rich with flavor and so many options. I try to come here really often just because I crave it so much! My favorite is the cowboy burger with their Mac n \"cheese\". I always feel so full and satisfied when I come here and the staff is absolutely amazing.   They need a NoDa location!"}
{"text":"Bean is a really great place to have a good vegan meal.  Tonight I had the buffalo tofu strips with a side of braised cabbage and Northern Beans seasoned with rosemary.  Everything was good and the staff was friendly and was able to explain some items on the menu that I was unfamiliar with.  I didn't think the atmosphere was too bad, it's an individually owned and operated restaurant that's trying to make a mark and you have to appreciate that!    You can't beat the prices and the menu has quite a bit of selections.  Try this place out!"}
{"text":"I'm in Charlotte visiting a friend. I looked up vegan places to check out which surprising weren't many. This place had good reviews so I was excited to try it out. I ordered the buffalo cauliflower wings. I've had these several times before at other places. These were my least favorite, they were just okay. My friend and I both ordered the jackfruit tacos which smelled really good but very bland flavor. We doused the tacos in salt and sauces hoping it would help taste good but we couldn't bring ourselves to finish one out of the 3 tacos. Very disappointing. Tacos came with 2 sides. I got the fried pickles and collard greens by the suggestion of our waitress. Fried pickles were just okay. The collard greens were overly dressed and cold. Overall I was not impressed or even satisfied with the food here. I'm not that picky of an eater, I can make do with most, but I can't eat tasteless limp food. Perhaps these cooks are different than the ones that prepared the dishes for thegood reviews."}
{"text":"Yum! Great big vegan portions at a tiny lil reasonable price. I had the bbq jackfruit, it was real good. Definitely go hungry, cause their sides are hearty and you'll need the fried pickle chips. I said need, and I meant it.  Oh and they make a bomb brownie with black bean flour!!! Bomb black bean brownie! A delicious alliteration."}
{"text":"Holy moly! Amazing Thanksgiving meal! Olive walnut dip, acorn squash curry soup, traditional meal, amazing desserts!"}
{"text":"I just had the worst dining experience that I have had in many many years.  And the service was creepy in that the wait people/manager were smiling throughout.   I ordered vegan bratwurst (mediocre at best) and a side of fried squash.  The squash was mush and I told the waitress that I wanted to exchange it for another side.   She looked worried and mumbled that she would ask the manager.  She shortly came back smiling and  said \"No, we can't do that\".  I said ok assuming they're undercapitalized.  She later asked if I wanted to box the squash.  Very irritating.  Then the manager came over and asked if we needed anything else,smiling weirdly.  When we said no, he said \"well we need your table\", again smiling oddly.   We left stating we would not be back.  He smiled and said \"that's ok\".     Once more, the food was mediocre to bad and the management is abominable."}
{"text":"I stopped here to visit the grocery side. Got some vegan marshmallows.   Will have to come back to try the restaurant side.   The location is kind of weird. The Uber or Lyft driver I had kept going in circles trying to find it."}
{"text":"Bean has incredible options making it easy for anyone to enjoy their creations!  While they did not have iced coffee as an option, they worked to create as close of one as they could for me, which was greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"One of my friends from out of town always talked about Bean, and when I finally got the chance to go, I wasn't disappointed! The Good Burger is without a doubt the best vegetarian/vegan burger I've ever had, the sides are delicious, and the staff is super nice."}
{"text":"Pretty good for no meat, I know that isn't the most shining overview but it is Vegan. If you're into that lifestyle you will love all the choices. Now, the fishless fish tacos made with Jack Fruit is outstanding and if anyone wants to give a go I will gladly return for those bad boys. Navy Beans with rosemary is spot on also. The tatter tot casserole is a liar and in no way represents tatter tots. All and all \"Eh\" is the best I can give at this point. Not the cheapest place either but keep in mind they're making meat replacements with other foods some of which is exotic so..."}
{"text":"One of my absolutely favorite restaurants in Charlotte. Bean is always consisted and I've loved everything on the menu this far. I rave about their vegan cowboy burgers  and I tell everyone in tell if they haven't came here to stop and try this infamous burger. The flavors are to die for. Never ever disappoints."}
{"text":"I am a meat eater, but I have learned that relationships are all about compromises. I also try to keep my eyes open to all kinds of cuisines, so when my girlfriend suggested going to bean, I was all for trying something new. What I did not expect, was having the best ruben in my life! And meatless?!!! The menu here is great. Covers all aspects. The people are friendly, and the prices are good."}
{"text":"A guilty pleasure for vegan food! I love the tofu fingers. Service isn't great and the food can be hit or miss, but I come here a lot when I am really craving meat. The good burger is super tasty too!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place now.   I will be coming here almost every time I am in Charlotte.  It's that good.  This place is what vegan non-pretentious restaurants should strive to be.  We got one of the burgers and a jack-fruit taco plate.  Both were very well prepared, well seasoned and large enough to walk out absolutely stuffed.  I don't have a single thing complain about and that is rare.  I have also tried their jack-fruit crab patties and they are stunning as a sandwich.  Be sure to check out their weekend brunch menu too.  If I lived closer, I would eat there at few times a month."}
{"text":"I simply do not even know how to start this review. Perhaps some back history first. I'm a local Charlottean. I have been a vegetarian for 3 almost 4 years now. I have heard stellar things about Bean. It has been on my list of places to try. Now let me take you to where I went yesterday. It was my Mothers Birthday. She knew I had been wanting to go and suggested we try it out for her birthday meal. What a disappointment! We went at lunch time yesterday. We walk in and the hostess/maybe manager on duty tells us to pick a seat. We grab a table. The server walks to the table and begins to apologize for the lack of light in the restaurant, \"because we don't know how to turn on the lights and usually they have a veteran here, but not today.\" So we had our meal in the dark. Then another server comes to grab our orders. I ask, \"What is GREAT here?\" well the words that came out of her mouth after that was jaw dropping. She said, \"well if you like Big Macs, you should get the Good Burger, and if you like the old Rodeo burger at Burger King, you should get the Cowboy Burger.\" Ok wait a min... wth? I cannot believe the words coming out of her mouth. She, working at a Vegan Restaurant is really going to come at me with fast food substitutes? I was horrified. Especially with how vegans really want to get rid of McDonalds and thier horrible methods of food production. We decided to go with none of her options as suggested. We opted for the Rueben with mega bean salad on the side, and the pulled pork BBQ sandwich with the tater tot casserole. The sandwiches were ok. The sides were simply tasteless and gross. We even got a dessert (being my moms birthday) and we ordered the KitKat Cake. That was ok as well, extremely small. But man, what a BUST! Nothing special. I should have saved my $31 dollars and gone somewhere else, maybe even perhaps the dreaded McDonalds or Burger King because that was a waste of money and time. Simply put, this place needs some work. Maybe I need to go back when a \"veteran is working\". Nah, forget about it, I just won't go back."}
{"text":"Visited on 9/14/17:  This a GREAT VEGAN restaurant! Staff was \"ok\" no one really went out their way to greet me. When I first walked in, I was unsure where to go to pick up my order.  The food was really good!!!! I had the sweet BBQ (jackfruit) and fried squash. The fried squash could use some seasoning."}
{"text":"On a road trip and spotted this place. Very friendly staff. Great concept, but the place looks run down. Sticky floors, chipped tables, broken floor tiles, torn chairs. I ordered a cheese burger and fries, plus a buffalo sauce fried cauliflower. Burger was okay, fries fresh cut and very nice. The cauliflower was tasty, but crazy oily. All this plus one drink was $25. Overall I would not return. They could really do so much more with this place!"}
{"text":"Great selection of vegan foods. Nice to order without worrying what it has in it but the taste was bland on the Mac and cheese, queso, and tater tot casserole. I was disappointed with them. Buffalo tofu strips were ok and the fried pickles were good. Maybe next time I'll order something I like better but it's nice to have options like this."}
{"text":"Great food, nice people, the only reason I didn't give it a higher rating is that the interior could use some fine tuning.  :)"}
{"text":"Good food horrible customer service. I was greeted by this gentleman who was extremely rude, which I hate to say might have been racially motivated. I have notified the better business bureau regarding this matter"}
{"text":"As a recent convert to vegetarianism, I am constantly looking for good places to eat. I went to Bean on a Saturday afternoon and was surprised it was packed.  The interior is very basic - wide open and just some basic tables with metal chairs.  Not super comfortable, but not horrible either.    I ordered the Crabbie dip as a starter mostly because I wanted to taste the Jackfruit I had seen mentioned.  The dip arrived and it looked just like crab dip and the taste was spot on!  The jackfruit was rather flavorless on its own, but the texture was ideal.  I would get that again for sure.   My entree was the pulled pork BBQ sandwich served with cole slaw. I would bet large amounts of money that if you gave this to a meat eater he/she would swear it is actual pork.  The texture was so spot on it was incredible!  The taste was perfect eastern NC BBQ - a bit tangy, a bit of a bite. The cole slaw was a perfect compliment and I was thrilled to have a meatless substitute for something I had been craving so much.   Overall the place was cheap.  Two lunch entrees, an appetizer, tea and a water - $27.   There is a bar area and there is a bunch of beer on shelves, but unless the night life is way different, I don't think I'd go to just drink.   But overall, I am kinda in love with this place and already planning my next trip."}
{"text":"I tried this place while visiting my sister in Charlotte.  She and I (both vegan) went with a meat eating friend, and we were all impressed with the food!  I had the barbecue jackfruit sandwich, I definitely recommend that!  It was delicious.  I also tried my sister's Reuben, great!  And our friend had the special of the day, which happened to be a burger, and it was great too!!  We split the krabby dip, and we all enjoyed that.  The waitress was very nice and helpful.  The only complaint I can think of is the tater tot casserole was a little bland, but everything else made up for that.  I will definitely be going back when I visit my sister.  I wish there was a Bean where I live!!!!"}
{"text":"I went here for a birthday dinner last night and I am glad I did! The place doesn't not have the best interior or exterior design, but the food makes up for it. I had the cheesesteak hoagie--made with seiten and daiya cheese for the substitutions of meat and cheese; along with the regulars of a cheesesteak. I added a dash of the Firewalker hot sauce that was on the table and it sent my food to the next level!!! The hot sauce was just that good and with me being a hot sauce freak I asked was it available for purchase and it was!!! They have a store of their menu delicacies available inside of the restaurant in the next room. I thought that was awesome! The restaurant's atmosphere was very relaxed inside and everyone was very accommodating. I went with some true carnivores and they enjoyed their meal as well. I recommend to any vegans or anyone wanting to try. The only reason I did not give five stars because my water was disgusting."}
{"text":"Ok, so I have to admit something. I have driven past this restaurant probably 100 times and never stopped in because it totally looks sketchy!  This being said, I am SO glad that I finally did. As a vegetarian, I was thrilled by the extensive and interesting menu. They have so many options, and many of them are customizable to fit exactly what you are craving. I ended up getting the 'Bean Bowl' with BBQ tofu in it. DELISH!  The only reason that I am not giving it 5 stars is the location and ambiance. It felt a little grungy in there, but once you get past that, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"First time visiting this establishment.  As I have driven by this place a dozen times. Great flavorful healthy food at a reasonable price. Wish they had a location I the south side of Charlotte.   They also have a bar area where they serve vegan wine."}
{"text":"I am not vegan or a vegetarian, however, I have an open mind and I am willing to try new things. Bean Vegan absolutely amazed me with what they do in the vegan culinary world. My meal started with the Pimento dip, which tasted every bit like I grew up with; additionally, we had the tofu fingers in buffalo sauce, which gave my typical Sunday wing binge a run for its money.  I had the bean and blue burger which was delicious and even tasted my date's Reuben (a sandwich I never expected in a vegan restaurant).   Bean Vegan is a gem amidst Charlotte restaurants with burgers, comfort food and great service. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"For the most part, the food is decent except for a couple of items that are extremely bland, to me. The service on the other hand has gone down. When Bean first opened everyone was friendly and welcoming, even the owners. But the last time I was there, which was about a year ago even one of the owners was rude. I placed an order at 1 and was told it would be ready in 15 minutes. I clock out to go on my lunch break and get there a little after 1:30. When I get there the hostess tells me that it wasn't ready, and she was really nice and sympathetic towards me. But after waiting 10 minutes and having to get back to work, I asked about how much longer. The young lady asked one of the owners (the heavier set one), he had the biggest attitude and acted like I was a nuisance just for inquiring about my order. So, I kindly cancelled my order and haven't been back since. And it's a shame because when I was pregnant I craved their food so badly. Probably, won't return for a long time."}
{"text":"AMAZING food for vegans and non vegans alike. My nonvegan boyfriend's favorite burger is from this place. Amazing selection and great staff. Will never pass up an opportunity to go to Bean."}
{"text":"WOW. The food here is incredible. The photos on the website don't do it justice. When the waiter (who btw was really nice and super attentive), my fiance had to damn near put a napkin under my chin to keep me from drooling. I had the cowboy burger which had a juicy patty topped off with some unbelievably good bacon and fried onion rings (no, we didn't come here for the salad) and the cheese was perfectly melted on the softest bun ever. They have a pretty good beer selection too which I don't think is mentioned on the menu (and great wine bottle specials too!). My hubby has the jalapeno burger which was [obviously] spicy, but nicely complemented by the vegan mayo. Suffice to say, we were deliriously happy by the end of it all, but could barely move. We are visiting from NYC, but this place beat any burger I've in NYC - by far...Bean Vegan, won't you please come to the big apple?!  It was only about a 5 minutes drive from uptown so super convenient to get to and they have large space so you're not sitting right next to another couple or group. I would highly recommend trying the dessert here too. We had the kit kat cake thingamajig and the chocolate was velvety and decadent while the wafers were perfectly crisp. I hesitate to compliment this place on it's delicious vegan food because it's delicious FOOD. Period. Vegan or not (my hubby is not), the food here (and staff!) is awesome."}
{"text":"I love this place, when I'm looking for greasy fried vegan food! So far the jalapeño burger, and buffalo tofu sandwich are where it's at! I would give this place 5 stars but every time I have ever gone, the staff isn't very friendly, almost like they don't want to work there. Also the food toook foreveeeeeer to come out. Even with only three tables in the restaurant for lunch. Minimum be prepared to wait for about 40- an hour, unless you get a salad. Fried pickles took over 20 mins. I get it when it's busy but not when there are like 5 people total in the restaurant. Either way I still go, because I like the food!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I being (and becoming) devoted vegetarians, we definitely wanted to try this place, and it did not stay on our list long before we ended up going there.  The outside, as my girlfriend had mentioned in the past, does not look like anything special for sure (it has a dull brown color and is right on the side of a large, fast-moving road.  They do say location is everything, but at the same time, you cannot always be as lucky as you wish to be in picking a spot for your establishment.  Walking into this place, there was a little bit of a weird vibe, but nothing we could not handle (we are all weird in our own ways).  I guess the owner of this place really likes superheroes and such, because there is memorabilia everywhere, on every surface.  Needless to say, it felt pretty weird sitting there with all of the figurines next to us, without much of an explanation from the owner (they could have come around and explained it, and I would have been much more interested).  I am not a stickler for professionalism by any means, but everyone in this place was wearing whatever they wanted to, and our server had the brightest white frames on his glasses, making it hard to really take much of the experience seriously.  For the fact that there were not many tables in this establishment, I thought that the service was relatively slow (contrary to when I had called a couple of weeks before and the person on the other end of the phone had said that they turn over tables pretty quickly).  Again, there was ample time for someone to come by and explain the place, its mission, why it looked the way it looked, etc.  I am pretty sure that I saw (who I thought was) the owner talking to a bunch of other parties, but we hardly saw him.  The server seemed a little delayed when we ordered the food, like he was unsure of what we were ordering or something.  We had a priority, which was figuring out what did and did not have nuts in it, for my girlfriend is allergic to them, and that would have instantly been a deal-breaker.  First, our server did not have much to say about it, and suggested we just order and go from there (not the worst suggestion ever, as it is what I may say where I work as well).  Who we thought to be the owner also came over, but his help was even less reassuring (\"yeah guys, we do use peanuts...\" not \"how can I make sure you enjoy my business as well as everyone else?\").  The food we ended up ordering was pretty great, I wold have to say.  For being vegan, it is pretty impressive that they could pull off a flavorful cowboy burger, barbecue chicken fingers, and fried pickles (although they left a lot to be desired, and the portion was HUGE).  The food was exactly how it looked on the website, which was helpful and satisfying, and the taste really was great.  In being consistent with the rest of the reviews I have done, I have given this establishment this rating based mostly upon their food quality, but there is much to be said about the service.  It definitely made the mood difficult to explain at best.  I am also attributing at least some of the mood to the fact that we may have been in a little bit of a sour mood while we were there.  Thus, I have tried to be as objective as possible in writing this review, but I do not know if we will be going back.  Although we ordered a lot to try (exactly how I wanted it), the food definitely costs a fair amount, and I cannot say right now if it is worth it for us to return."}
{"text":"Food was meh, service was horrendous.  I doubt I'll be back. I rather spend my money at Fern."}
{"text":"Yummy vegan food (try the cowboy burger and the tofu fingers) in a casual setting decorated with comic book covers, Star Wars art, and action figures. The only downside is that service can be a little slow and it might feel like your food takes forever -- but keep in mind that the wait means your food is being prepared as ordered and will be fresh. Still, the wait is killer when you're hungry. Good place for kids -- they even tape up their artwork on a wall in the waiting area!"}
{"text":"I've passed this place countless times and hadn't been in. My boyfriend was taking care of lunch so I decided to try it. It was take out, so I didn't get the full experience, but I was pleased with what I ordered.   I had the barbecue jackfruit sandwich; I've never had jackfruit before but OMG it was really good. Succulent, a little spicy, and piled high with tomatoes and pickles (they don't normally come with it though). I also tried their queso dip with the chorizo and black beans. De.Li.Cious.   My boyfriend was skeptical about trying this place because he didn't like the sign (he thinks it looks odd-a big, brown bean...like that had anything to do with the food). He's a fan now.  I'll definitely be going back. I'm so glad more vegan restaurants are popping up in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I go to Bean Vegan often for lunch and dinner. Just wish there were more places like this restaurant.  This place makes a vegan diet easy with its great vegan comfort food options, plus salads and vegetables.  My favorite meal is the Tofu Finger sandwich with Tator Tot casserole."}
{"text":"Burgers, salads, homestyle meals, appetizers, and desserts. Mouth-watering yet? It is all vegan cuisine! Take it from a non-vegan, the food is delish. You'll forget you're eating vegan cuisine. Great food, service, and prices aren't that bad.  Overall, a great place for vegans and non-vegans alike.  Read my detailed review at www.voyagingfork.com"}
{"text":"New to this restaurant and tried the raspberry zinger, it did not taste like raspberries just lemon and coconut. Asked if I could have a different cake. It's a $6 slice I didn't get my money back or a different slice. Not a happy at all. Thought this was going to be a good experience but it wasn't."}
{"text":"4 stars because of the absolutely dreadful location for an out-of-towner and the mac & cheese was a letdown BUT everything else more than made up for it! Our waitress was very kind and attentive. Sidebar: I'm still regretting not ordering dessert and considering stopping by on my way out tomorrow. Don't make the same mistake!  We ordered the buffalo tofu tenders as an appetizer with a side of ranch - delicious. My lunch date got a burger topped with chili and a side of tater tot casserole, and I ordered the Reuben with mac & cheese. The Reuben was phenomenal, and I had half leftover to bring home. If you're vegan, this is a must-visit, and don't forget dessert! :)"}
{"text":"Love this place.  It's so hard to find diverse veg/vegan food - so to have a whole menu of safe items is great. My vegan family members and friends love the choices.   BBQ Bean Bowl, Country Fried Patties, Krabby Dip, Jalepeno Cheeseburger, Buffalo Tofu Fingers, BBQ & Grits Brunch are all that I've tried, and I can't wait to go back. :)  And of course the desserts are great!"}
{"text":"I want this restaurant to thrive. They cater to vegans and offer some great selections (not to be confused with all healthy options, mind you!). I've been here twice now. My lunch included their version of a Big Mac, which was delicious. Again, not healthy, but my side of veggies with hardly any noticeable oil or \"butter\" was most definitely healthy. I splurged on their chocolate/caramel dessert. It was good but pricey.  My second visit on a Friday night with my husband, resulted in really good food again. His salad was loaded with fruits and veggies and came with an awesome dressing. My jackfruit tacos were a nice surprise and now I'm looking to try jackfruit at home too. We shared a ginger cookie, whipped cream dessert, which was a good ending to our meal.  The drawbacks are hard to overlook... the location is completely out of place and is only accessible going into town on the crazy Highway 74. The restaurant itself is so plain inside & out. So plain it's a bit of a turnoff to those who might not be drawn in by their specific food offerings.  I understand they recently got their liquor license, but I'll be surprised if that drastically increases traffic. They were noticeably uncrowded on a Friday night, pre-alcohol sales. The location & interior isn't a place I'd go out of my way to get a drink at. I'm simply there for the food.  Move this concept (and chefs!) to a more central, appealing, convenient location and I think they would be far more successful. I, for one, would be ready & willing to dine here more often to support this local business."}
{"text":"We weren't very impressed with Bean. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, and I feel if you are going to go specialize in Vegan cooking, your Vegan items should be better than restaurants that don't serve vegan food.   The staff was very friendly and helpful, but everything else was lacking.   We got a veggie burger, and it was small and average tasting. I've had better veggie burgers at Ruby Tuesday, and I hate that place. The side dishes were just things you could make at home. They tasted fine.   We also had our order come out wrong. We were the only one's in the restaurant and ordered 1 thing, and we waited a while for it, so this was disappointing. They fixed it fast and were very nice.   But, maybe we caught them on a bad day, everyone has bad days."}
{"text":"Terrible management. The owner was awful and a bigot. Place was FILTHY. The food was a joke for a vegan restaurant . EVERYTHING is fried. I would have enjoyed eating at a Waffle House more. Good luck keeping this place open."}
{"text":"Got their Thanksgiving multi-course meal to-go. It was wonderful! It tasted fresh as well, and homemade with love."}
{"text":"A girlfriend of mine helped me do some stuff around my house so I treated her to lunch.  She picked Bean Vegan Cuisine.  Neither one of is Vegan, but she is trying to eat healthy stuff.  I was starving & I wasn't sure this was going to fill the bill.  O my yum!    She had the Bacon Cheeseburger $?, which was a soy-based mix & Saitan which was thin-sliced as the bacon.  I took a bite - just a veggie burger to me.  (I can't eat soy, so I'm ok with that anyway)  She also got the side of zucchini which was delicious.  I had the Bella Bowl $12... A huge bowl of Jasmine Rice covered (but not smothered) in some kind of reddish bean (not kidney), they blanched Kale (!!), smoky portabella 'shrooms & some kind of drizzled dressing or creme.  (looking at the photos, the creme drizzle must be a signature flavor)  I loved it and it was so fillingI took more than half home to eat for dinner - just finished it!  The also have a selection of beers & wines.  My friend had a Red Ridge (I think that was the name) It was a Sorghum Beer.  Light body, with a hint of Sorghum (think molasses) in the color & finish - very clean. I had the Crispin Cider which was good.  Expensive to have a beer though... $6/bottle. (even PBR)  The inside is more like a slightly dingy diner with two-tops up against the long wall & a couple of group dining tables elsewhere.  The music was kind of 70's early 80's but they were singing right along to it.  Whatever makes you happy.  Getting into the restaurant is only on the uptown expressway side.  You have to turn right and get on Briar Creek & go across the overpass to turn left back onto the South-Bound Expressway, but other than that it's definitely a neighborhood gem as far as the food and service go.  I'll go back again!"}
{"text":"I've had many bean burgers and wasn't that thrilled with my experience.  I had my burger to go and normally take pictures.  I frequent a place called Farmacy vegan Kitchen in Tampa so I was expecting something similar from Bean vegan and was disappointed.  The texture was tough and the zucchini fries were on the greasy side.    I was also new to the restaurant and excited about trying vegan in the Carolinas, but they were not helpful at all.  Probably will not again"}
{"text":"Really great vegan spot in Charlotte! This was actually the first strictly vegan restaurant I visited since starting my new diet so I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Upon looking over the menu though, I was excited, everything sounded so good! I ended up choosing a veggie burger that I think was called the \"cowboy\". It had veggie bacon, onion rings, bbq sauce and came with yummy fries. Pretty yummy. For appetizers, we ordered bbq cauliflower and \"crab\" dip. Let me tell you, that cauliflower was EPIC! I could eat it every day for the rest of my life it was so good. The crab dip was delicious as well. My favorite part of the meal by far though was dessert. My wife ordered some peanut butter chocolate pie thing that was EXCEPTIONAL and I ordered the cookies..LOVED them both. Delish!   What's great about BEAN is that there's a vegan grocery store attached to the restaurant so you can stock up on food items and other small vegan goodies while you're there.   I'll definitely be visiting Bean again next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Best vegan food in town! Hands down, everything here is amazing! The burgers are my favorite splurge/cheat meal!"}
{"text":"Going meatless is easy.  Preparing food without dairy and eggs and getting the same crunch, tenderness and savory flavor is hard, hard work.  The vegan food at Bean is among the best I've had.  My favorites were the teriyaki fried tofu fingers and the kitty kat cake.  I also had the meatloaf, mashed potatoes and grilled zucchini.  My entree was really good but especially the meatloaf.  Folks, if you've had vegan meatloaf before, you know all the ways it can go wrong.  The decor was pretty spare which I was expecting.  For diners that can easily order off of any menu in Charlotte, this is pretty shocking.  My dining companion and I didn't come for the ambiance.  The owners are doing the right thing by putting their resources in the menu and worrying about the decor later.  I hope Bean is around for a long time."}
{"text":"My wife had work today and I didn't so I brought the baby to meet here for lunch. Now, I am not a vegan but I do try to eat as healthy as I can. I love meat. At the same time, I love how I feel and how good the food is when I eat vegan.   That being said, I think this place may have some of the best burgers around. I am talking about real meat burgers included. My wife and I each had a different burger today. Me, the cowboy burger, and my wife the jalapeño burger. Both super delicious. I have tasted a lot of the sides and have yet to find one I don't like.   I challenge anyone who has thought about eating healthy or even eating vegan, they must try this place to realize that you can eat all the \"same\" things and not compromise your health."}
{"text":"I need more stars! I love Bean! No...really. I LOVE BEAN!! As a vegan,  this place is my second home. The culinary creativity is amazing! Flavor of the food is ORGASMIC! I ain't lying! I make loud noises when I eat.  More, if not most, importantly...the people who we work here are some of the friendliest people in Charlotte and you can tell they live what they're doing. MY FAV'S...  Weekend Brunch- Carrot Bacon changed my life and most recently, they had Tofu Benedict. Dayum!! It was good.   Bacon Cheeseburger Jackfruit BBQ Sides...macaroni and cheese, fried squash and collard greens Desserts-If I'm ever in a coma...someone get me 2 slices of raspberry zinger cake and 6 cowboy  cookies. Oh lawd!  They also serve local craft beers. Sweet! Most recently, they opened a grocery section selling all sorts of vegan deliciousness.  If you're  looking for vegan marshmallows...this is the place to get them.  I LOVE BEAN!   The end."}
{"text":"The food is great the decor is modest.  I also want to stress that stores/restaurants like Bean that are ultra specialized may not generate the revenue many mainstream restaurants have.  The place was older but clean."}
{"text":"Good food, servers were lovely, but Manager/owner seemed to yell at employees a lot.  Thought this would be a more enlightened establishment but I guess I was wrong . Disappointed."}
{"text":"Only have been vegan for a week so I was scared to try imitation stuff like burgers. To my surprise everything I ordered tasted like the real thing! I ordered the jalapeño cheese burger with tater tot casserole and they were delicious! I didn't like the mayo on it though too salty. But I will definitely be a regular!!!"}
{"text":"At the risk of sounding completely redundant, I am most definitely not Vegan (do you capitalize Vegan?). Even Meatless Monday - or whichever day you prefer - is difficult for me. Making some soup? Throw in some chicken stock. Doesn't matter if it's vegetable soup, the meat makes it taste better. Especially if it's bacon.  So why Bean? Why not? Seriously. I have no idea at all why we stopped. It seemed like a good idea at the time.  Luckily, the staff is apparently used to folks like myself, who have no clue what is going on when it comes to ordering at such a place, after being used to, well, everywhere else. They were very kind. Or maybe they just had pity on me.  Two things stood out.  First of all, the decor is not. That is, there isn't any. It's dark, and not in a romantic way. It's sad. Maybe they need more bacon, and I don't mean tofu bacon or something like that. It's dark in a sad bowling alley-during-the-day sort of way. It doesn't make it horrible, just that it isn't welcoming. Luckily, the staff is nice (see above).  Second, the food is good, considering it's vegan. It's even decent considering it among other food. But it's not great. You eat a vegan bacon cheeseburger, you know you're not eating real bacon. Or a burger. Or cheese. At least the lettuce is real. Probably. Then again, I may have just been excited to recognize something."}
{"text":"I checked out bean while visiting Charlotte one weekend and decided to satisfy my fast food side and went with the King Burger with fresh cut fries. They did not disappoint! The fries were fresh and flavorful as well as the burger.  The burger was obviously freshly assembled and the Seitan had a nice flavor and texture. Some Vegan restaurants can't get it right but they did and think their burger could rival and meat burger. I opted out of the Daiya cheeze just because I loathe the flavor and texture of Vegan cheezes. It just doesn't do it for me.  That's neither here nor there so don't mind my rambling! :-)  Go check them out, I did and was delighted."}
{"text":"I had been dying to try this place for months, and sad to say I will not be returning. Upon walking in my shoes were sticking extremely bad on the floor and I could tell it was not cleaned recently.. I finally got sat at a table and it took over 10 minutes for someone to come by and get my drinks and I made sure I emphasize that I would like lemon, and it was forgotten, multiple times the server walked past me with my cup and my spouses cup empty. We got the cauliflower appetizer and it was AMAZING. That was literally the only good think about my meal.. I got a burger and I was excited to finally eat a burger for the first time in over a year & it was DISGUSTING. My spouse also wanted me to take a bite of his philly cheese steak and the bite i took was halfway cold. Extremely disappointed to say the least i was really hoping to enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Rude tall guy that took my to go order. I ordered over the phone 20mins before arriving,the order was never placed! Instead of saying sorry we forgot to place your order the guy told me to go somewhere else and place the. order. While I was there two other customers complained about the service. These ppl are racist!!!!!!"}
{"text":"When you want comfort food, Bean steps up to give you just what you're looking for!  It was here that I had a Cowboy burger with delicious BBQ sauce and a perfect patty.  Coupled with the fries - YUM.  We also ordered the Chicken & Waffles - I'm not the biggest fan of tofu acting as chicken, but when something is fried... it's hard to go wrong!  The waffle is something I'm going to try to recreate at home :)  Loved their posted stats about positive environmental impacts from eating vegan.   This is an odd location - right off of a highway!   Team here is very homely!"}
{"text":"Woo Hoo! A sit down all vegan dinner place in the Queen City!!   Charlie and Roy couldn't be nicer owners, both came over to chat and check in on our meal. I'm rooting for these guys and hope Bean becomes a Charlotte landmark in the near future.   The Jack Fruit Tacos -um, yum. So so so tasty. Mashed potatoes and mushroom gravy, just like I make at home. I'm not a huge fan of the mac n cheeze but us vegans are kinda snobby about one's preferred mac.   The service was excellent, adequate seating and no problemo to get to even on busy Independence.   Bean just opened so menu is a bit limited, currently no liquor license and I'm sure there's a few kinks to work out (we didn't experience any) but for the first full week - things are looking great. I can't wait to update this once the full menu is up and running."}
{"text":"Let me start with the fact that I am not a vegan and have no plans to become a vegan BUT this place was great! I had their bean bowl with portobello mushrooms and substituted their vegan ranch dressing for their sesame ginger dressing. The cornbread was a little dry but overall, I loved my meal. Two others ordered the bean bowl but one ordered the teriyaki tofu fingers and they were a lot better than I expected. Another individual in my group got the crabbie pattie platter and she also loved it. In addition she ordered the collards greens and fried squash (yum!)  Wether you are vegan or not and wanting to try something new, I suggest stepping out of your comfort zone and trying Bean"}
{"text":"Still a favorite place for us when we come to Charlotte!  The tofu fingers sandwich and side of onion rings is enough for my daughter and I to share.....as we need to keep a bit of room for the large dessert selection.  We enjoy the atmosphere too.  Wait staff always attentive and friendly"}
{"text":"Bean is so so delicious!! I had the crabbie Platter with Mac n cheese and collards as my side, everything is so dang tasty it's unbelievable. And the desserts are out of this world-- the chocolate cake is my favorite! The owners and staff are so kind and friendly. I live out of town but every time I'm in Charlotte I have to come here!"}
{"text":"I REALLY thought I had already reviewed this place!!! I am not a vegetarian or vegan, but had decided that I wanted to be healthier and try new things, so Bean beckoned to me every time I drove by it.  I stopped in one day and I was the only one in the place shortly after they had opened. I got the chicken fingers (tofu) with ranch dressing and I think a hashbrown casserole of some sort? OMG, everything was DIVINE!! The textures would fake out even the most discriminating carnivore. The taste wasn't the same, so it'd be harder to trick them, but it still tasted good! I loved every part of my meal. The ranch dressing was freakin amazing and I wish I could have bought a jar of it to take home.   I really wish I could have gone a few more times before I moved away. It was such a unique experience that it has made me want to try other vegan dishes. 5 stars are well deserved for this place, and the prices are good too."}
{"text":"Sorry. Cannot recommend. Call me Yanks or whatever but Southern Food DOES NOT all have to be greasy fatty fried food! Gees, I begged my family to take me to this place for Mother's Day, not sure what I was thinking. But as the \"foodie\" and vegan that I am, I really wanted to give it a try. Especially with that awesome name!!! Unfortunately, we were all so disappointed! We ordered around 5 different dishes. They all were super greasy, they were all soaked in heavy sauces of vegan cheeses and creams, their vegan burger left much to desire and think about. Not sure what vegan cheese brand they use but the American cheese flavor in the burger had such an off taste and there was a weird sweet taste to the burger. The rice and bean dish was also disappointing, the beans tasted like they were straight poured from a can. The fried pickles were super super super soaked in grease and they were spicy hot which caught us by surprise. Now as I am super fair, one thing we loved was how nice they all were! I didn't have the heart to complaint at the moment (nor wanted to completely ruin Mother's Day), so we just let it passed and as it was my first visit on a busy holiday I give them the benefit of doubt. I am still open for maybe a second visit, yes that's the mercy in me not my mind side. I simply cannot believe they have such poor quality and still keep open and busy. Oh one last thing, the cleanness of the place in overall left much to desire. I'm all earthy, kind of granola hippie friendly, but if you're a female waiter and choose to leave your underarm hair grow (or even a male) please do NoT crop your T-shirt and expose your hairy underarm while serving and reaching plates over a table! That's just common sense... just saying. Hoping to have another type of review next time around. I am going to give them a chance!"}
{"text":"As a vegan, I want to love Bean for my unhealthy/comfort food food cravings, but I just can't.   First of all, the place just seems dirty and has a funky smell upon entering. They really need to clean it up.  They have a great selection of food on the menu and some nice specials, but much of it just doesn't have good flavor (I.e. The Mac & Cheese). Last time we were there, we had the buffalo cauliflower which was quite good. And I ordered the Reuben, which was good but had an underlying strange flavor. In retrospect, I should have sent it back. I ended up pretty sick that night. Not sure if it was the sandwich or just a coincidence.  We have been a few times and it seems that service and food have gone downhill. The waitstaff is not very friendly and there doesn't seem to be much \"heart\" in the food or service.  Like I said, I want to love Bean - and do love their little market to buy some goodies, such as Chao cheese, to take home, but they really need to put back some heart and pride in to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the slow service. Ordered our food and have waited for 30 minutes so far.... Folks that walked in after us have been served. Very sad for us as there aren't many vegan restaurants in NC.  Update: took almost 40 minutes to receive our meals. No apology, just an excuse of \"lots of take out orders were placed\" all by folks that came in after us. When the kitchen was asked about our order (table 15) we heard \"oh shit\". We watched folks come in after us that were seated be served before we were as well.   Very disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious and I'm not a vegan. I ordered the Good burger and the special sauce was amazing!!!! The fries were so good as well. Will totally go back to this place!! Perfect place for food even if your not a vegan."}
{"text":"Can we say COMFORT AMERICAN STYLE vegan food!!! I couldn't be eating here everyday but it was a phenomenal experience. I came in with 3 other friend whom had never been to a vegan restaurant and they were so happy with their meals. The tofu fingers had the exact batter and crispyness of chicken wings, and the jackfruit crab salad was to live for. The burger was for sure one of he best I've ever had and my Jon vegan friend said it was the best he has ever had. I'm not a local but the Charlotte hospitality has been the best, except that this restaurant had annoy so nice server which is why I'm giving it a 4 star. Mmmmm enjoy your cruelty free and very yummy experience."}
{"text":"Had my first bean experience a few days ago and went back today because IT IS THAT GOOD! I had the crabbie party platter both days, I tried the cabbage and squash the first day. The squash is incredible! I don't know how else to describe it other than it was the cleanest fried squash I've ever had! Tried the collard greens today which were to die for! I will most certainly be becoming a regular!!!"}
{"text":"WHAT VEGAN DREAMS ARE MADE OF. I relocated from the west coast and have not had vegan food like this out there. I first ate at the Asheville location and this one is just as amazing. I could go on and on about the menu but I shall let my photos speak for themselves. Secondly, I'm so impressed that I got to see/meet the actual owners at each location and hear how passionate they are about their business and the glorious food. Thirdly, you can order one of their whole layered cakes which is literally the best tasting cake I've ever had...it's serious stuff. (I got the chocolate one for my sisters birthday. It was a hit with all the vegans and skeptical non vegans muaha!)"}
{"text":"I love bean first vegan meal I ate was the portabella bowl and I loved it reminded me of steak. I also love the mushroom po boy and there brunch waffles they are the best."}
{"text":"I used to be amazed by this place. However now when you order a salad, the corn bread is left off and you feel awkward asking for it, or you order the cheesecake and there's no chocolate drizzle or whip topping... or there's no silverware for a take out order... I think a lot of the little things that make the food good are getting over looked, the last salad I got was really just plain gross. It tasted old... I'm really sad as I write this review because I want to love this restaurant, but I've been disappointed too many times."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times when we're in town.  A pretty good comfort-food dive joint.  I thought it was a tad overpriced this time--2 lunches and 2 drinks $48 with decent tip after a tip had already been added to our bill which I did not notice.  Don't know if that was because we had 4 in our party with 2 separate checks or what.  Anyway...  I like the foods and we're Glad there are vegan restaurants around.  You can buy some vegan groceries in the attached market.    Also, is Pepsi vegan?  I was surprised to see it being sold."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food here. Visiting from out of town and looked up vegan restaurants in the area and came across this one. The service was great."}
{"text":"Great variety, enjoyed the crabbie patties even though they didn't remind me of crab. The grilled zuichinni was"}
{"text":"This is my wife's favorite place to eat. The kitchen here is really friendly! We've come several times over the years and the chef always recognizes us and says hi. Highly recommend the jack fruit tacos and fried pickles. Oh, and if you need thanksgiving dinner, try it here."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Bean Vegan with friends last night for the first time.  We tried a little of everything, and really enjoyed it.  We are not Vegan, but love plant-based food and Vegan food.  I had the Jalapeño burger and my wife had friend tofu.  Our friends had Jackfruit Carnitas Tacos and a Ruben. We also shared some of the sides, such as Tater Tot Casserole, Collard Greens, Grilled Zucchini and French fries.  I don't eat sweets, but admittedly loved a taste of the Kitty Kat and chocolate cake.  The place is quaint and the staff was really nice.  There is also a small Vegan food shop attached to the restaurant which was nice.  Overall, we were all really pleased."}
{"text":"Bean ...is delicious. Since I'm sailing on the vegetarian side these days , I'm glad there is a spot that offers vegan meals with taste .   The decor is nothing fancy , but I'm a huge comic book fan and I admired the numerous comic book figurines in the bar area. I wasn't aware of the store before I left , I will have to go back to see what goodies I can buy .  We started off with the fried pickles, delicious but a little too salty , it however didn't stop us from devouring them . I ordered the buffalo tofu fingers with a side of Mac and cheese and braised cabbage , I was pleasantly surprised everything had flavor. The Mac and cheese didn't taste the best but it wasn't bad either , I added hot sauce and killed it    My daughter had the good burger with fries, and my love had the cowboy burger , he stated it tasted just like a beef burger . All in all I will be visiting Bean again , I'm curious on the flavors of the other vegan , home cooked dishes ."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for vegans and non vegans alike! I am a new vegan myself and I was super excited to try this restaurant! I took my sister and my best friend there for dinner last night and although neither one are vegan they loved the food! We started with the buffalo tofu fingers which were delicious! Followed by two portobello specials and a bacon burger and we were all satisfied! The food was hot, fresh, and fast and they both agreed that they would enjoy coming back to the restaurant with me (: The only reason the restaurant doesn't get five stars is because of the location /:"}
{"text":"First visit, and the food was enjoyable. I also liked the chocolate cake and was glad it was not cardboard dry. I came here after seeing my regular go-to place has gone out of business and so this is bittersweet. The other place is no more and this place was a good find. I definitely look forward to exploring the menu next visit and trying more that they have to offer.  The market/ store is a bonus."}
{"text":"Bean offers solid options. I highly recommend the Cowboy Burger, and the Jackfruit Carnitas Tacos! The market within their restaurant is a miniature mecca of vegan products."}
{"text":"The owner of this establishment was extremely rude, disrespectful, and combative. I have never been spoke to in such a way in my whole life. He has 0% customer service skills. His reaction to a dish not being up to par was out right outrageous. He treats his employees very poorly as well.  This was the most unpleasant experience. Needless to say I will Never be returning! I advised anyone that's considering dining at this restaurant to think twice."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!! We came here with friends while visiting Charlotte. Everything we ordered was great - including the meatloaf!! I had the cowboy burger and it was delicious. Shout out to Victoria and Erin!!"}
{"text":"I'd rate this a 1 or 2 to be honest, but because my vegan brother wanted to go here for his birthday (and loves it), I inflated my rating a bit.   We went in and no one greeted us / even acknowledged we were there. Eventually, the manager moving slower than I've seen any restaurant employee EVER walk, came over to ask how many we had (5 of us standing there). He walked away, served other people, took their bills, then finally came back to us saying where he was \"planning on seating us\". I went and sat down whereas the manager asked the people at our long table if it was okay.... then came back and gave us the menus.  Clearly, it was going to be a bad experience since it started off so poorly.   He eventually came back to ask what we wanted to drink, but we had more than enough time to read the menu and figure out what we all wanted.   When our food came out, my brother wasn't given his extra side that he ordered (rice & beans) and the kid who brought the food out proceeded to tell us that it was rung up as something else and kept talking about it. All he had to do was apologize or say okay let me go get it.   I got the fishless fish sandwich because other people on Yelp raved about it and I agree it was good. The fries were just okay. Both were covered in grease and I'm kind of shocked to see that at a vegan place. Sure it's \"southern comfort food\" but since when does everything have to be fried and greasy?"}
{"text":"My new favorite vegan place in Charlotte. I had the jack fruit bbq sandwich and it was every bit as good as real bbq. The sides were awesome too. Friendly staff and good dessert options. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I ordered the fried pickles and crabbie dip to go. I rarely order fried food. I was please until I saw the amount of grease that was in the bottom of the box! OMG!  I thought I would give them some feedback. Well, to my surprise, the guy who I spoke to was nonchalant and said that's what happens and there isn't anything they could do about it. WTHay! I didn't call for a refund; just feedback... Basically, he really didn't care about what I thought, so I don't care about ever going back to Bean Vegan Cuisine! As far as I am concerned, if the general attitude is that this is how they do things; take it or leave it; it's not worth me trying anything else on the menu! #poor_customer_experience #not_worth_2nd_visit #turned_off"}
{"text":"Bean gets it right every time! I am not vegan or even vegetarian but choose not to eat a lot of meat. I was curious to try this place a few months ago and am I am so happy I did. All of their sandwiches are so flavorful and filling. Today I tried the BBQ sandwich with Cole slaw and it tasted better than pulled pork BBQ. Def check this place out- even if you love your meats. You will not be disappointed. Their market carries La Croix too!"}
{"text":"This is a whole-in-the-wall kind of place but was extremely yummy! I had the BBQ pork sandwich and it was absolutely incredible. The service was also great. 10/10 would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Wife and I are, admittedly, recent converts and this was our first purely vegan restaurant. And we were very pleasantly  surprised. I had the jalapeño cheddar burger and my wife had the old fashioned. There wasn't a bite left either plate.   The service was quick and friendly. The waitress was fairly knowledgable on the ingredients and gave honest recommendations (not just \"everything is great!\"). For a couple who still craves meat occasionally, this place is a great transition restaurant.   Will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Took my daughter here last week for dinner. This was my first time at a vegan restaurant. What a fantastic experience! My daughter, a vegetarian, was so excited to look at a menu that she could choose anything from! She had the bacon cheeseburger and sweet potato fries. Me, I'm a straight up meat eater, so I tried the reuben sandwich with a side of mash potatoes. Wow, I was really impressed with the flavor and texture of the reuben. The mash potatoes were ok but I really liked the sweet potato fries. We also had a dessert. I think it was called the Kitty Kat something. Chocolate, peanut butter and wafers, yep, it was damn tasty!! So, after this, am I going vegan? No, but I am now a fan!!"}
{"text":"DIRTY DARK SMELLY & RUDE  I'm black so black folks don't hate on me being honest. I went on a Tuesday around lunch time, my first, last and only visit.   As soon as I open the door, it looks like a dive. It's so dark in there and then old building funk hits me in the face. I don't mean like an antique store, I mean like an old damp basement. Ughhh. I run to rest room. Nasty and sticky floors. Hibbee jibbees thinking about it.  I come out and I'm told I can't sit 25 ft from door,  as a short thick black female points and reads sign \"You are supposed to wait before being seated\". Ho you have 4 customers total, me included. You should be more accomodating when you barely have business.  I'm not trying to be funny but I don't know too many black folks that are vegan down south, and I'm staring at 3 other black dudes, in there 20's (at separate tables, no food in site) in the restaurant that do not look vegan, and as someone else had mentioned, there was this odd atmosphere as if I had interrupted something and I was an outsider. It just has the feeling it's a front for other activity.  Between the old damp funk, sticky nasty restroom floors, rude greeter, and strange ambiance, I decided to take my business elsewhere and drove to south end and tried Luna's Living Kitchen. Great atmosphere and decent food. I can't believe others aren't  mentioning how unsanitary Bean Cuisine is. Just yuck. The double doors to the kitchen is nasty too. See for yourself."}

{"text":"A friend of mine came into town for the weekend and she's transitioning into the vegan lifestyle.   I've seen this restaurant a few times in passing and since we were headed to Ovens Auditorium to see WICKED, it was the best spot for a meal before headed across Independence Blvd.     I ordered the tofu scramble with breakfast sausage, spinach and mozzarella with a biscuit on the side. Everything was good except my biscuit being cold..so I opted to get wheat toast instead.   This was my first time trying a vegan meal and overall I had a good enough experience to try a vegan dish again.  However, the restaurant could definitely add some more decor to lighten up the atmosphere."}
{"text":"My favorite thing on their menu is the Buffalo fingers and waffles.  This restaurant isn't a \"healthy\" vegan spot, but it's pure vegan. I would recommend calling in your order.  However, i gave them 3 stars because the service is slow & careless and the environment isn't really welcoming."}
{"text":"Ok, so this isn't the greatest looking restaurant...It's a bit shady looking and the floors are sticky, but the food's great!  My daughter had the chicken tacos and she said they were very flavorful.  I had the fish sandwich and it was delicious.  For dessert we had the Kitty Kat pie and it was very yummy!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Always an excellent choice to get a quality vegan meal.   Can't go wrong with anything on the menu.   I would have given it 5 stars but the food always comes sooo slow! Just give yourself time and don't be in a rush"}
{"text":"Very rude customer service. The guy that served me had the dirtiest nails. Not only was he rude to us but I saw him (talk big guy) was super racist to the two different black customers that ordered Togo. Please respect your customers since your job is to provide service!"}
{"text":"Buffalo tofu strips - it's very soggy. The buffalo sauce on the tofu was very good though. The ranch complimented the tofu very well but it would have been better crunchy.  Double cheese burger - mushy, falls apart, soggy bread, and a strong daiya american cheese flavor."}
{"text":"I liked this place. I'm not a vegan, but everything I had was pretty good! I had the Cowboy burger, the mac and \"cheese\" and the the fried cauliflower \"wings.\"   The burger was DELICIOUS.  The \"wings\" were DELICIOUS. The mac and \"cheese\" was okay... but, with some salt and pepper and hot sauce it was better! I personally think that mac and cheese is a hit or miss no matter where I go though."}
{"text":"We like eating vegetarian, so we were excited to check out Bean. We were hoping it'd be less expensive than Luna's.   We started with the queso, which was very good, but I would call it more like a chili dip than queso.   For dinner we had the Reuben and the cowboy burger. The Reuben definitely won, but both were very good. Tasted like the real thing!   We aren't super into the meat substitute thing bc we actually eat meat, but our dishes were great. We just kind of hoped we would have dishes with fresh veggies rather than trying to imitate other dishes. We know it's a vegan place and not a vegetarian place though."}
{"text":"Oh it's such a nice place to eat with friendly staff and wonderful food- my new favorite is the barbecue soy curls on rye - absolutely delicious.  And it's such a comfort to know that everything is vegan"}
{"text":"This restaurent is GREAT! My friend brought me here and I am not a vegan. I must say that I was so surprise how delicious and full the food made me. I even had a dessert and guilt free.  The service was great and I will be back"}
{"text":"Well, we spent $100 for 3 peeps our first trip here because we tried several things and placed an order to go as well. The biggest let down was the service or to be honest, the lack thereof, servers were completely inattentive then visibly annoyed by our requests when they finally resurfaced. Additionally, we received seething glares from other servers who were just chilling at a back table by the beverage station across from where we were seated. First, we ordered our drinks and luckily, they do serve beer, not draft but at least it was craft and bottled, not canned. I ordered Mother Earth Weeping Willow Wit, thank goodness for small favors, this is one of my favorite beers, so it was one of the better parts of the experience. Then we ordered 2 apps, pimento cheesish with corn chips, better known as tortilla chips and fried cauliflower buffalo style with ranchish dip. The pimento cheeish was not good at all and it had an odd taste. The fried cauliflower did not have any buffalo sauce on it but it was pretty good despite the pool of grease and the batter falling off. We asked to trade the pimento cheeish for fried pickles but were told they do not allow trades nor do they give refunds. Okay, fair enough...but you just walk off without waiting to see if we wanted to place an order for something else?!? Cool, we just placed the order for fried pickles when the entrees arrived and as she quickly turned to leave, I added another beer. Both kids ordered the spicy \"pulled pork\" sandwich, which is made from jackfruit and topped with slaw. One ordered with fries plus Mac & cheese, the other one ordered with mashed potatoes and gravy. I ordered 2 sides as my entree, red beans and rice plus fried squash. I tried the jackfruit and the slaw, the slaw was delicious and the jackfruit put me in the mind of tofu, not bad, just a little chewy. My daughter said it had been battered and fried as well but I couldn't taste that. The Mac & cheese was extremely bland, so sad because that's a classic and likely a side most customers would want to try. The mashed potatoes and gravy side was great, very smooth and creamy, some potato skin mixed in, very tasty! The fried squash was pretty good, cut in chunks rather than slices so it was still firm, not mushy as typical fried yellow squash often is. The red beans and rice were really good, very tasty and well seasoned. Rice was cooked perfectly as were the red beans. We ordered a burger to go with fries and it took a little longer than expected so when we asked one of the many servers we had about the status, she snidely responded, \"I have no idea, I didn't place the order\"...okay, can you check on it? It arrived shortly thereafter and we asked if we could get the Kitty Kat Pie to go, the server was not happy, demanded payment upfront of \"$6.50!\" Anywhos! While we waited on the pie order, we browsed the small grocery shop inside the restaurant. It has quite the selection of vegan items including some house made items. I'm not sure that I'll ever return, good customer service is a must for me. If I do ever decide to pay a visit, it'll likely be to pick up a to go order only. As we were leaving, we noticed a sign out front reading, \"Now Hiring\"! Yes, I think that about sums it up!"}
{"text":"As much as I want to like Bean, they wouldn't let me dine with them with a coffee mug, and requested that I leave it in my car. Excuse me? So you want me to buy your expensive coffee when I already have a mug of my own? Needless to say, I took my business to a different vegan establishment that respects the fact that they even have customers willing to buy their food in the first place. I will not eat here until they change their policy regarding outside beverages. I'm not trying to bring in a freaking happy meal, it's a coffee mug. Get over it! Fern was more than accommodating of me and my delicious personal cup of coffee, so they got my business. Sorry bean, when you start respecting customers I'll be back. Bye-bye!"}
{"text":"As many have said, the service is usually not the best. Roy is great, but they have trouble keeping a motivated staff.   That being said, I have been a regular here since the beginning and still enjoy it overall. The brunch stands out as the best in the city for vegans and non vegans in my opinion.   For dinner service, you just need to know what's good and what's not. There are a few sides to avoid and one or two entrees. Other than that, I'm consistently pleased with what I get. Southern vegan comfort food."}
{"text":"Not bad. Lots of fake meat and tofu, but the tacos are tasty...made from jackfruit but they could easily pass for chicken or even fish tacos. Creative! While I probably would not order anything else on the menu, I will say that these tacos are the most amazing meat-substitute I have found.  This is definitely COMFORT FOOD!"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan but found the food really good!   I got the Bean Bowl with Fried Buffalo Cauliflower.  It was very tasty and filling!   The chili looked good too.   They also serve drinks.  It's very casual."}
{"text":"During this visit to Bean, I was with the same friend who has become a bit of a vegetarian plus an omnivore friend.  While waiting on them, I shopped for jackfruit in their cool store.  The associate there talked up the soy curls, and even though I didn't buy any at the time, she gave me a recipe sheet. I was intrigued. So, I decided to try the salad bowl topped with spicy soy curls and a side of blue cheesish dressing.  Unbelievably good.  That salad was loaded with every vegetable possible, including tofu and blackeyed peas.  And the soy curls?  Yummy chewiness with a nice spice.  We also shared fried pickles and Southern style fried tofu with their version of Ranch dressing.  We all loved the crispy, not greasy appetizers.  The guys got the jackfruit tacos and were both impressed.  The hard core carnivore said, \"I never thought that vegan food could be so good.\" And, you know what I did?  I marched back in their store and bought some soy curls.  Let's hope that I can do them as much justice."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal! We shared the queso (it was just ok to me but my husband really liked it). My husband ordered the Reuben (very rich!) and I had the tacos. Our sides were collard greens (the best part of my meal!), tater tot casserole, and grilled zucchini. All of it came out in a very timely manner (I don't know what the problem was for the other reviewers). We had an appetizer, 2 entrees, lemonade and water and out tab was $31. Friendly staff. Comfortable dining space. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"This review is specifically for the breakfast menu they offer on the weekends. This menu is fantastic! The carrot bacon is a must-try. We always get the brunch bowl and the \"chicken\" and waffles and everything is SO GOOD. Pro tip: when you order the chicken and waffles, you can choose pecan or mixed berry waffles instead of just plain."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great place for some down home vegan cooking.  Even if you don't like ranch dressing try theirs, it is very thick and garlicy and it is hard to believe it is vegan."}
{"text":"Although the food here is AMAZING, the terrible customer service I just received here will cause me to never come back. I walked into a fairly empty restaurant in Sunday afternoon.  I proceeded to place my order with the pleasant girl behind the counter. The girl comes back moments after I placed my order to tell me they couldn't honor my request for my onion rings to be on the side of my burger. I was confused by this so I ask her is there any particular reason why? The manager/owner comes from around the corner to tell me there isn't enough space in the Togo box to put them on the side. I was even more confused. I ask the manager, can I have them in a separate container or in one of my other boxes? He said NO I'm not going to do that you can either get it on the burger or not at all. And I simply replied that I still want the onion rings to put on my burger, but I want them on the side to add myself later. He proceeded to give me more sass about ordering the burger the way it's supposed to come, told me he wasn't going to argue with me, and walked away. The sweet girl asked me if I still wanted the burger on my order. Before I could even answer her, he comes back around the corner and says have a good day. I replied I'm not getting my order now? He says you don't want the food how it comes so you can have a good day. After all of the drama of course I decide to just leave while he kept sassing me all the way out of the door. For one, I have never been to a restaurant that has flat out denied my request to have my sauces and/or condiments on the side. I've worked in restaurants for over 10 years and I expect sass from servers and bartenders from time to time, but the owner of a restaurant giving a customer such a problem for wanting to spend money in their business is insane. I hope that he was just having a bad day today and this isn't his typical response to customers. I would never say that the food here isn't amazing, because it is. But steer clear of this guy. And snaps for the sweet girl I don't know how you do it."}
{"text":"I always have a good meal here! Definitely try the bacon cheeseburger and the tater tot casserole! The best burger in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Don't let the weird location off of Independence fool you this place is probably the best Vegan restaurant in Charlotte! They describe themselves as down home vegan fare and that is exactly what they are.   This place is great for lunch or dinner one of my favorite dishes is the \"meatloaf\" which comes with corn bread and two sides. I love the tater tot casserole, green been casserole and the three bean salad but all of their sides are great.  Along with the restaurant they have a small vegan grocery story which is very handy. One of my favorite thing is that the place is decked out in comic book/ super hero decor.  If you have not checked this place out next time you are looking for some great vegan food that a lot of people would not realize is  meat and dairy free head over the Bean!"}
{"text":"This was my first time going. I got the bacon cheeseburger burger it was really good. I will def. be going back. On the other end no one explained to me how the service works.  I was sitting at the bar waiting to be served to grab a beer/wine or something.  I know the servers saw me just sitting there and no one approached me and asked me if I needed anything.  I think that I was supposed to go back to the cash register order your beverage while you wait and a server will bring it to you... but again not sure no one said anything... If someone is just sitting at a bar assume that they want a drink.  Next time I'll know."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the best vegan restaurant in Charlotte, then Bean is it!  I have been here like 20 times now during my travels through Charlotte and compared to the other restaurants in the city, Bean is the best all-around.  My to-go orders are always ready (except one time) and each item is at the proper temperature. Service is kind. The restaurant food is priced appropriately. And although there has usually been one thing I wasn't crazy about, Bean is solid! I can recommend the pulled (soy curl) bbq sandwich, the Reuben (homemade seitan), fishless fish sandwich, slaw (it is vinegar-based), cabbage, layer cakes (outstanding actually), kitty cat cake, cowboy cookies, and peanut butter pretzel cups (think Take 5 bar). The meatloaf and tater tot casserole are good items as well. The mega bean salad was okay. I can't stand the fried (oily) zucchini, but I don't like fried foods anyway and I don't know what I was thinking when I ordered it. They also have a lot of grab and go items in their market which are good.   Solid vegan food, friendly and efficient service, local organic products, and their mission statement is based on the health benefits of a plant-based diet. Love it!  Even though I think it really is 4 1/2 stars I'm going to upgrade my review to give it five. I think I can be classified as being a Beanstalker now. :)"}

{"text":"Went into this establishment for the first time today and had the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!!! As soon as we walked in we stood at the door for 10 minutes waiting to be sat as we were ignored by the man working. Finally we get sat and were handed menus 25 minutes later the server has still not came back by to even take our drink order!!!!! we patiently wait and then get up to simply ask if we could get some waters. The man working gets offended that we ask for something to drink and then ask one members of our party to leave, So our friend leaves and then he tells us that we need to leave as well because he was not going to serve us although we said nothing to him. Everyone in the restaurant was in totally shock that an employee had just acted this way towards us as we are paying customers. My friends that were with us are actually vegan (i am not) eat here regularly but now will never return after the way were treated and neither will I. Treating your customers like this will not get you very far in the restaurant business.... Not to mention the health rating was a 93.0"}
{"text":"So I was super excited to bring my Omni friend to his first vegan restaurant. He was so excited to try some vegan food from a restaurant, and I had been raving to him about Bean. We literally were sitting in the parking lot for twenty minutes waiting for them to open. I have been there before and had the Reuben and the breakfast bowl. This time, I opted for the buffalo cauliflower bites for my entree and some queso dip before. The queso dip was okay. Nothing special. It was not a cheesy dip but more like a black bean dip from a jar. My cauliflower bites come out, and I take a small bite from one of them and then put it right back down. It was DRENCHED in oil. It was so oily it was inedible. The pictures I have posted really don't do it justice. I could have poured all of the oil into a glass to drink. It was not the buffalo sauce (which the owner tried to defend later on the phone from his other location), it was STRAIGHT UP OIL. So I begin looking over the menu to see what else I can get because I could not eat these. I tell the waitress about it and show her and the first words out of her mouth were, \"We don't do exchanges or refunds.\" I told her again that I could not eat them. They were drenched in oil to the point of being inedible. She said, \"well they look fine to me. I would eat them. I eat cauliflower bites all the time and they look fine.\" At this point, I am just frustrated with this server's response because this is no way to treat a guest. I asked for a manager. She said with a nice smug grin, \"I am the manager.\" It was honestly hilarious. She was so proud to announce that. She's the manager... but yet she's also serving the tables? Interesting. And also, how in the world did any mentally sound owner decide SHE should be the manager? She was the rudest person I've ever met. Guests always come first. This is food and bev 101. You take care of your guests, no matter what the issue may be. You don't say, \"they look fine to me. I would eat them.\" The least they could have done was remake them or give me an exchange of the same value. That's just poor business practice... They must be struggling financially. Anyways, she dropped the bill off and didn't take the cauliflower bites off and never offered any compensation. I sat there for like 20 minutes trying to figure out if I should pay or walk out. I ended up paying. So I found out the owner is currently at the other location in Asheville. I gave him a call to let him know, and he immediately went defensive. He said he would not do anything because I did not like his food. I explained over and over again that it's not that I didn't like his food, it's that it was inedible. He said there's nothing wrong with his food and the cauliflower bites are saucy. I told him it was definitely not the sauce, it was oil. This went on for about ten minutes and he just said he trusted his manager and he's not going to do anything. I said well thank you for your time but this is extremely disappointing, AND THE OWNER HUNG UP ON ME. How unprofessional. I will never return to Bean because of this awful experience. I will also continue to spread the word on the experience and the unprofessional and rude response from the management and owner.   Seriously Charlie, a no exchanges or refunds policy is ABSURD for food that is improperly cooked. I know you kept trying to say your food is properly cooked (even though you weren't there) but if a guest is so upset by an experience from your management that they feel the need to call you, you do something about it. I would be happy to send you some books on management 101 to your Asheville location.   TL;DR: buffalo cauliflower bites were drenched in oil and inedible. Very rude management said too bad no exchanges or refunds. I called owner because of the awful experience with his management and he defended them and said he won't do anything... and THEN HUNG UP THE PHONE ON ME. EXPECT TO GET RUDE MANAGEMENT AND SUBPAR FOOD IF YOU VISIT BEAN."}
{"text":"This spot has a really nice ambiance. The food is really good as well. I always order the teriyaki style fried cauliflower with vegan ranch. This time though, the skin just kept falling off the cauliflower, so I couldn't enjoy it as much as I would have liked to. Next time I want to try the jackfruit."}
{"text":"We had the Buffalo strips, the crab cakes wit mac n cheese and the meatloaf with zucchini.   I don't mind the location really, the service was great! Our server's hair was amazing (Nothing to do with the restaurant but she deserves props okay!!)   I thought everything was very tasty especially my meatloaf and zucchini. I would definitely eat it several times more. I did not like the mac but then again I'm vegetarian not vegan so a girl loves her cheese! The crab cakes were also so crunchy I really liked them. Buffalo strips were Devine and that vegan blue cheese was the tits!!   I do still prefer Luna's but I might come back if they happen to be closed. I would recommend this place to anyone who is dancing around the idea of going meatless because the food tastes very good and many options are fried, so it's easier for some people to enjoy things that are fried lol."}
{"text":"I find that one of the most difficult things about turning vegan is worrying what you'll be able to eat and if it'll taste good. I've been vegan for a little more than a year and have been eating here for the same time frame. This restaurant has the BEST food. I usually always end up eating the Jalapeño Cheddar burger because it's soooooo good, their chorizo dip is delicious too. The atmosphere is comfortable and relaxing, they have music playing in the background at just the right volume. They also have an attached mini store next to the restaurant giving you access to vegan foods to take home with you. I've been there about 10 times with my friends and boyfriend, some are vegan some aren't but we can all agree the food is delicious. My absolute favorite restaurant in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Visiting as a result of Hurricane Irma. As traveling vegans it can get a little tough to find a good spot. This place was sooooo good. I had the buffalo cauliflower and the cowboy burger. Definitely come check this place out!"}
{"text":"I called and ordered my food at 8:09. Teriyaki cauliflower and a bean Bowl. I've ordered before and it has never taken me almost an hour to get my food. I just now got my food at 9:02pm. I was told by the young lady with pink hair that it was going to be 15mins. I drove from quail hollow area to independence. That drive alone is loyalty to Bean. I didn't deserve the bad service, lies, along with the bad attitudes. The chick with the braids was rude and was a  horrible hostest.  it has to be a better way to service your customers especially loyal ones.I've never experienced such sucky service before in my life and it's bad because we don't have many vegan restaurants in Charlotte. I'm very disappointed and I would like my money back the food was even bad tonight,what is going?"}
{"text":"A friend invited me to celebrate World Vegan day at Bean the other night.  It was my first visit here but I am open to trying new cuisines even though I eat meat.  I had also heard great things about this place.  Inside the restaurant looks old.  The building looks like an old Denny's and it hasn't been updated since it was built.  But don't let that fool you.  The best food often comes from holes in the wall.  That is the case here.  We started out with an order of Fried pickles.  Out came a huge basket of pickles enough for 10 people and they were so good.  The vegan ranch dressing was also very good...better than most regular ranch dressings.  For an entree I went with the rueben which cam recommended by another Yelper.  And it did not disappoint.  Good flavors, tangy dressing.  Only changes I would make is less cheese and more kraut!  For a side, I had a side salad which came with all sorts of fresh veggies and beans.  Next time, I may just opt for the salad for dinner.  I love a good salad!    For dessert, my friend and I shared a raspberry \"cheese\"cake.  Honestly, that was some of the best dessert I've had in a while.  It was creamy, the raspberry flavor was in the cheese and it really had a nice flavor.  For my carnivore friends, don't be afraid of vegan food.  Branch out a bit, it's worth a try.  And if you like it, it's worth coming back for more.  I think vegetarians and vegans will agree!"}
{"text":"It was good...I guess!  I'm new to the whole Vegan idea, so I'm not sure.  I can only compare it to what I'm used to,  so it was, just Ok!  I got the Jackfruit Carnitas Tacos with the Mac &Cheese and Collards.  The Jackfruit did NOT taste like \"Pulled Pork\" by any stretch and the Mac& \"cheese\" was my least favorite!  It was made with that Nutritional Yeast.  The Collards were really good, they were the best part.  So I'm giving a generous 3 stars!  I will go back and try something else, maybe..."}
{"text":"If I could give a 0 I would. I used to love Bean, and raved about it to vegans and non vegans alike-- but over the last year or 2 it has declined MAJORLY. I feel sick after eating there now 9/10 times, as do the friends who eat there with me as well- but I kept giving them chances. The final straw was how terribly rude the manager & the owner (I think his name is Roy?) treated me. Due to their error they forgot to include food items in my to-go order that I paid for, and when I brought this to their attention to give them a chance to correct it they were so awful to me I actually couldn't believe I was speaking to management at first. By nature I am not a combative person, and I don't enjoy conflict, so let it be known I was incredibly polite about their error and was not anticipating any push back from them since they made a simple mistake they would obviously correct if they knew(or so I thought). They would not reimburse me or offer me the food that they forgot to put in my order. I gave them my hard earned money for nothing in return, and it made me sick to my stomach. The owner told me that he didn't owe me anything since he offers take out as a 'favor' to customers, and he doesn't care about the to-go orders (which BAFFLED me because it's not like he's giving food away for free- we are still paying the same price for the food and giving him business). It is clear he has no place in owning or running a restaurant, nor does the manager who has zero customer service or people skills. I will never waste my time or money at that 'establishment' ever again. Let this be a warning to those who are still loyal to Bean, I was too at one point, but there comes a time when you can no longer support people or businesses that don't care about their service or their customers. I don't know what happened to this place, but it has gone sooo downhill. I would rather invest my money into vegan businesses in Charlotte that deserve it. It is clear to me they are not concerned with how they treat their customers, and it is not surprising they have such a big turnover rate of employees. It all stars with the owners, and managers. Anyways, I rarely leave reviews but I thought it was important to let others know about my experience and hope they never have to go through that or be spoken to the way I was spoken to."}
{"text":"My wife is vegan, and I eat vegan most of the time. We were excited to try Bean and it is now a must-stop when we are in Charlotte. The burgers are satisfying and probably the most convincing substitute for the meat versions...they have one for every taste (even the \"old fashioned\" Carolina style burger with chili and slaw). I have also tried the \"soy curls\" BBQ and it was very good. One thing that really impresses me is that they make onion rings from scratch! Almost nobody does that anymore. The service is not super fast but that is typical of vegetarian/vegan joints...guess it comes with the lifestyle. They've always been friendly. We'll definitely be back!"}
