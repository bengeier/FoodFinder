{"text":"Dinner started off well an amuse-bouche of 3 bite size quiches.  I ordered the cut of a leg of lamb with thyme sauce.  It was served with some kind of green garnish and a side of French Fries.  French Fries?  Couldn't they come up with some other way of cooking the potato?  Potatoes au gratin perhaps?  Something that requires more culinary skills than dumping fries into the fryer.  These weren't even fancy fries made with fresh potato pieces.  They were the same ones you might pull out of your freezer.  -1 star for the lack of imagination on the starch side dish."}
{"text":"I just spent a week in Paris, and this reminded me a lot of the brasseries where I had a lot of my meals.   For the reviewers that complain about this place, I think it is because they do not understand French brasserie food.  Pommes frites (\"french fries\") for example are a VERY typical accompaniment to any grilled meat dish, particularly beef, chicken, or lamb.  If I'd been served \"au gratin\" potatoes with my bavette de l'ayalou (skirt steak) I'd have been very suspicious!  By the way, the meat was cooked perfectly, with a nice char on the outside and warm and red in the center (not too rare).

I had dinner here with my family, and we were all very pleased with our meal (and we are all very big \"foodies\").  The food is unpretentious, reasonably priced, and served in a very comfortable atmosphere with attentive, friendly service.  In a word - a classic  French brasserie (but with good service).   

For those who don't understand what a \"brasserie\" is, it is like an English pub, but with a brighter lighting, better food, and an emphasis on wine and/or coffee rather than pints of warm flat beer.  :-)"}
{"text":"I came here with friends and my sister at the suggestion of a concierge at the hotel I stayed at while in Montreal. We asked for recommendations for reasonably priced, nice quality French food and this was the first idea. Glad we went! They start you off with some mini quiche and some fresh baguette slices. Most of the items on the menu reminded me of classic meals one would find in France, including chevre chaud salad and some interesting meat entrees. We ordered several french onion soups which satisfied the cravings of many, and some tasty salads. The house red wine was wonderful too! Had a lovely experience overall. The decor was quite Parisian as well, which made for a pleasant setting. The waiters are dressed quite formally, so I would definitely throw on a blazer or a nice top, just advice so that you don't look too out-of-place. The only negative aspect was that they took forever to bring the facture (bill), but it was still nice that they left time for us to chat amongst ourselves I guess. 

I would take my parents here, it's definitely a restaurant that young adults and their parents would enjoy together."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch, nice semi formal atmosphere.

Breakfast, at 12.5$ all included. Also nice. Returning soon."}
{"text":"The only time I ate here, my salad had a used bandaid in it. To make matters worse, the manager was completely uninterested. He acted like he was doing us a big favour by not charging for the salad."}
{"text":"A friend asked to meet and eat here.  He liked it because it reminded him of a Parisian bistro/cafe.  It seemed slightly like one but I wasn't particularly intrigued by the decor or slighly more upscale ambiance of the restaurant.  The service was quite good though.  The food wasn't particularly interesting to me.  I had the soup of the day ($4.50) which was cream of the in-season vegetables and a rosette de lyon sandwich ($8) which was basically salami on a baguette.  When the waiter mentioned it was a sausage, I guess I imagined more of an American or german style sausage.  Not that it was bad but it was a salami sandwich you could find in any sandwich shop.  I guess I would've perferred something a little more distinctly French.  The sandwich came with a side of fries, which were a bit soggy for my taste.  The service again is what really shone in my meal here.  There's also a nice outdoor patio to eat in if the weather cooperates."}
{"text":"I usually go there for breakfast, which is very reasonable and the decor is great. Service is very professional and there is not too much to add. Feels like having breakfast in Paris. Definitely a nice change from other brunch places."}
