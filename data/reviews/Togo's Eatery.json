{"text":"One of the best sandwich shops I've ever been to.

The sandwiches are actually as big as advertised, you can barely fit your mouth around them!  I highly recommend the Turkey and Avocado.  Friendly staff, a little pricey, but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Togo's is not the place to go if you want a veggie sub.  I can't comment on the quality of the meats but their vegetarian options are boring.  What's the point of a cheddar cheese sub if they can't toast it?!?  Oh, the humanity!"}
{"text":"Vegetarians beware! Ye are entering into a land where meat is king, veggies are flavorless and hummus is bland and overbearing.

If you eat meat, then I'm sure Togo's is fine. Perhaps great. I don't know. 

But I don't eat meat, thus making Togo's hell in a sandwich shop for me. They have only a couple options for vegetarians, one being the hummus sandwich. Never get it. It's sick. 

I guess if you don't know what good hummus tastes like, then maybe you would like this sandwich.  But I hated it.  They spread it waaay too thick and then added a few bland veggies and that was that.  I suppose you could do a make-your-own veggie sandwich, but they're not all created equal and I would have to venture that anything without meat at this place just isn't going to be tasty.

Vegetarians of the world, eat somewhere else."}
