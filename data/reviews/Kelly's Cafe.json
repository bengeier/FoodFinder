{"text":"Kelly's cafe has the best breakfast in Brunswick.  The crepes are out of this world."}
{"text":"I didn't want to drive down to Starbucks and a coworker told me about this Shop, and I  decided to give it a try. (Going out in a Snowstorm none the less). I was very surprised when I walked inside. Its very welcoming and the service was awesome. The Chai Latte was fantastic and smooth, didn't taste watered down at all unlike Starbucks. I also got one of breakfast crepes, which was fantastic as well."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast here on a Saturday morning, excellent crepes, excellent coffee and great atmosphere, definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Amazing crepes and the staff and owner are super friendly. The atmosphere is nice and relaxing and there's usually something interesting going on."}
{"text":"Shhh, don't let word get around how freaking amazing this place is. Limited seating and I always want to be able to get a crape fix. 
The food is amazing the service is spot on. Hard to find good breakfast food, because the chain restaurants sure are not the place.
If you decide to give them a try you will not be disappointed you will be satisfied."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming here!!!! Kelly the owner is amazing! I always stop up here at night for ice cream or a milkshake. The coffee is also really good if you want it. The cinnamon apple crepe is to die for! Overall the place is amazing, great atmosphere, great people, you will enjoy it and keep coming back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Another great crepe at Kelly's. Nice people, fresh food made to your liking. Oh and don't forget the Mitchel's ice cream."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here about a month ago I meant to write a review but of course life gets busy. I wanted to say yummy very good! I've never had a crepe before I was amazed by all the different creations!! I tried a savory one with vegetables and cheese very good I didn't care for the sesame Mayo it was on the side so it didn't affect the crepe. My friend ordered the French toast with bacon in it and she loved it!! Everything was very good we will definitely be back. The people were friendly that made for a comfortable atmosphere. Highly recommend this place.  Cute place"}
{"text":"Great customer service and amazing crepes! Both sweet and savory to choose from. Wonderful atmosphere and the regulars are a hoot! There is a large variety of coffee drinks available but the tea is only in tea bags. If it was loose leaf tea it would have rocked my world!"}
{"text":"Amazing crepes, cool atmosphere.

I want to give a bad review so people will stay away, and the place could be all ours. My wife is in love with this place. The sesame mayo was awesome. 

Just go, try and enjoy. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"A great selection of savory & sweet crepes and yummy Mitchell's ice cream.  The staff is super nice too!"}
{"text":"Love it!  This place is really special. Good coffee for quick carry out or relax/work at the shoppe. Good wireless for work/study. 

Now for the food - the crepes are phenomenal!  Several different kinds, likely more than a couple you would like to try. Sweet crepes made fresh and several heathy options like a turkey and spinach crepe with homemade chipotle mayo on the side.  Crepes take about 5 minutes to make but they have 2 skillets going at all times. Much faster service than a similar shop I visited in Nashville which had only one. This place is great!"}
{"text":"Pretty much look above ;) this place is rocking crepes and serves Mitchell's ice-cream.  With exquisite music and intimate atmosphere this place feels right."}
{"text":"Love this place !!! The crepes are so yummy !! I have had both sweet and savory! We have gotten it togo several times and they are just as tasty ! I love \"the stuff \"! Also you can modify or create your own! The owners seems to know everyone who comes in and she is always there! This place never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Kelly's is a staple for our household. We typically get the turkey, veggie, and goat cheese (cheddar for our son) crêpe, followed by the strawberry and Nutella for desert. And the Very Berry smoothies are a must have! You can't go wrong with Kelly's specials either - \"Just Trust Me\", Taco, Sweet Corn Bread - all fantastic. We recommend Kelly's to all of our friends, and anytime we have visitors in town we always introduce them.

You should stop into Kelly's tonight, and call out to Hayley (before she leaves for school) - \"HEY, HAYLEY! TWO VERY BERRY SMOOTHIES, PLEASE!\""}
{"text":"Kelly's is a great quaint place. The drinks, crepes, and smoothies are all amazing. Wonderful people working and free wi-if...:)"}
{"text":"Went to Kelly's for coffee ( Pumpkin spice latte year round?!) frequently when helping a friend in the area. Once for crepes, they were great. Fresh and very satisfying to say the least!"}
{"text":"Creptastic!  Good food, good prices, good service, and a jolly cup o' tea. Great for a Cafe stop and all the Crepes are delicious. I like the healthier more savory/rustic ones with mushrooms and spinach. Getting these makes me think I am eating something healthy. They do have some sweet dessert flavored crepes too, which are also great.  I would come here frequently, if lived near by."}
{"text":"Happened to find this place on yelp. showed up with seven people.  Quaint  very friendly amazing food.  Definitely a place the locals know about & I understand why. The food was wonderful.  Large portions. Only one person could finish their meal.  I will be back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"It's officially Wednesday at Kelly's for us. You can go here for dinner (savory crepes) or desert (sweet crepes) and relaxed casual atmosphere. Excellent hot cocoa and the chicory coffee is the best."}
{"text":"Kelly's Cafe serves crepes,  coffee,  and ice cream, what else can you ask for?  Service was great,  coffee was served in a real mug and the food was fantastic!  I highly recommend this wonderful cafe."}
{"text":"We just shared a delightful lunch at Kelly's Cafe! Started with the cafe salad - bibb lettuce, goat cheese, dried cranberries, mandarin oranges, pecans. Then the veggie crepe with mushrooms, spinach, onions, peppers. And then the cinnamon apple crepe with cream cheese, pecans, and whipped cream. It was all so good, the atmosphere was relaxed and pleasant, and the people - Kelly and her father - were so friendly. Wish this place was closer to home!"}
{"text":"This was interesting. Found this place on Yelp, saw 5 stars and had to give it a try. Stopped in at 8:15 on a Saturday morning only to find out they don't open until 9:00, so we came back on Sunday at 11:00. 

Never being here before, I wasn't sure what to expect. The place is small, only a dozen or so tables and a bar against the front windows. We walked in expecting to be greeted and seated, but no one seemed to notice. Walked up to the register in the middle of the store and was told it would be 30-45 minutes. I thought that was the time for a table. Asked if we could sit at the window bar and was told yes. After about 10 minutes I figured out we were supposed to order at the register, at which time the 30-45 minute clock starts. 

So let's get this part straight...this is a crepe place. Nothing more, nothing less. Didn't quit get that in reading Yelp. Never had a crepe before so I was curious as to what we were going to get. Jess ordered the Cinnamon Apple with homemade whipped cream cheese. I had the 'Man Crepe' ham, sausage, bacon, egg and cheese. I also got a coffee. 

While awaiting our crepes, I finished my coffee. Read on Yelp the coffee was dynamite. Found it to be nonoffensive, but nothing special. Also, had to walk back up to the register for a refill. Didn't expect that either. 

Then the food came. The cinnamon apple was beyond outstanding. Yumity yum yum yum. The Man Crepe was good too. Loaded with stuff and hot as blazes. I saw a pan of hash browns, but apparently you have to ask for potatoes. No toast either. 

Bottom line, food quality gets 5 stars. Service something less than 3. Suggestion to the owner:  Ask when people walk in if they have been there before. Explain the menu and the process to the noobs.   You've got a good product, but a unique way of serving it."}
{"text":"Kelly's cafe is a great place to check out for breakfast or brunch. The crepes are excellent! I have tried the little show, monte cristo, and butter me up over the few visits that I've had and they were all delicious! I am taking one star away, because it does take a long time for your order to be ready. Not a place to come if you're in a hurry. And also because they need a better ventilation system above the crepe grills. It's always smokey in there and you leave smelling like it."}
{"text":"EVERY time I eat here I am amazed at how delicious something as simple as a crêpe can be. Kelly's knack for blending complementary foods together is a delight to even the snobbiest \"Foody\" out there. I have yet to be even slightly disappointed by anything I order. To her credit, there are so many menu options available I've never ordered the same thing twice. Subsequently, I've never been disappointed either.  This is a hidden gem in Brunswick."}
{"text":"I love finding hidden little gems such as this place. My husband and I tried Kelly's cafe for brunch today and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. There were so many savory and sweet options!! We got the lemon strawberry and Katels-- both delicious! My only negative is that the wait to get our food was really really long. It took over 30 minutes for just 2 crepes and the place wasn't even that busy."}
{"text":"Read all the review and gave it a try.  It's good, but not amazing.  Probably just my tastebuds."}
{"text":"I have been to Kelly's several times and never have been disappointed. The staff is friendly. The decor is relaxing. The whole cafe is spotless. The food is exceptional. I used to go to tremont for a crepe. No more!! Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!! You have to try this place. You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"What a nice little find and the best crepes!  Cozy and charming inside with friendly staff.  So much better than the chain places we've grown so tired of.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had the bacon sausage spinach and swiss crepe with the very berry smoothie
Everything was fantastic!
Cant wait to try one of the sweet crepes- 
Servings are generous, so that will wait for my next visit 
Service was friendly and fast
Restaurant was clean and friendly
Loved the art work on the walls
Will be back often!"}
{"text":"Finally got to stop by here this morning and try it out. I got the egg, sausage, veggie, and cheddar crepe, it was as VERY good! Full of delicious veggies and it was served with this yummy sauce! I will definitely be coming back! Next time I'll have to try a sweet crepe! The service here is phenomenal, everyone is friendly and kind!"}
{"text":"I went here on Mother's Day, around 9:30.  I knew it would be crowded due to the day, however I was not expecting the disorganization I encountered. I have never been, there was no one to greet me, or explain that I had to order first. The servers were overwhelmed and saw we walked in and ignored us!!  Once we realized the process, we waited in the line.  Everything on the menu sounded delicious, we placed our order decided to have carry out.  I was disappointed I wanted a nice breakfast out, once we said carry out we were informed it was an hour wait!!! Once I showed my disappointment, the lady making the crepes (only two crepe griddles) snapped back that there were a lot of people ahead of us!! I understand that, however that should of been what was said BEFORE we ordered!!!"}
{"text":"Danielle and i stopped for crepes a couple Sunday's ago. 

I want to give them a great 5-star review but i had some issues with the fact that a bunch of teenage girls came in and were just way too loud. the owners were cool with it, i guess because they didn't stop.

the food was REALLY good. no doubt about it but jeez, things could have been so much more enjoyable if someone had told them to pipe down. it wasn't just me. there were other patrons there that, unfortunately close to the prepubescent cacophony and looked incredibly annoyed as well.

i would really like to give it another shot again sometime, though. the crepes were that good."}
{"text":"Very cozy little place hidden in a strip mall. The crepes were amazing! They make them fresh so it takes awhile."}
{"text":"This quaint little shop blew away my expectations the second I walked in the door! It's fun, quirky atmosphere was perfect. 

Enough about that though, we need to address the crepes! Yes, crepes! Kelly's specialized in crepes. 

These aren't your every day, run of the mill crepes either. These were huge, over stuffed works of crepe art!

I got the chocolate cherry cheesecake crepe and my date got the Apple pecan crepe with caramel drizzle.  They were delicious! 

Kelly's has savory crepes too, but I can't vouch for those. ... yet! We will be going back and trying the savory options. 

This was our first date and Kelly's made it a great one!  Awesome food, delicious coffee, quaint and quiet. Perfect spot for a brunch date!"}
{"text":"I have been driving by and working in the same shopping center for a year and didn't even know this place existed.  

It came highly recommended by another friend of mine, and with that I had to check this out.

It's located in the Discount Drug Mart shopping center on Pearl Rd In Brunswick. They have a nice seat in area inside that seats about 25 people inside and another 10 or so outside. 

If you have a group of 6 or more, call ahead and she will reserve a table for you, as it can be busy and at times I had to wait 15-25 minutes for a table before(well worth the wait IMO). 

Kelly is the owner and pretty much is the one that cooks all your food, she is very friendly as is her staff as well. 

They have quite a menu, from savory crepes to sweet crepes and she can customize it pretty much any you want. She has crepes for the meat lovers and the vegetarians. 

My favorite crepe is called \"The Big Show\", stuffed with turkey and sausage/egg & potatoes, very filling and it's priced right. 

I could go on, but you're only going to get more hungry and then upset that you haven't been here earlier, come check this place out. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"OMGOSH!  Was looking for a centrally located breakfast place to meet my gf. Read the excellent reviews on Yelp. Boy were they right. This place is AWESOME!  Can't wait to go back and try more. They suggested we split 2. The Bacon egg spinach and Swiss savory crepe was to die for. Fresh peach sweet crepe.....well let's just say I almost needed a cigarette after. 
Dare I say, my best savory crepe experience had been at the Bellagio. This is better. 
Bottom line....it's close......IN BRUNSWICK......and delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing crepes!!... the banana split one is my favorite with a scoop of Mitchell's ice cream.  The owner makes the crepes herself and she is awesome!...Love this place!!!.."}
{"text":"Just freaking go.  If you have to wait, and sometimes you will.  Its totally worth it.  Kelly's is the best!"}
{"text":"Love Kelly's Cafe. Great staff and food. When you go walk up to counter and place order then find table. Staff will bring your drinks and food to you."}
{"text":"Wish I could review this one. No hostess to meet us and no one payed attention to us when we walked up to the counter. It smelled good in there tho."}
{"text":"I swear, I get crazy cravings for this place all the time it's so delicious! Everything they make is pure gold, and at an affordable price! They offer delectable crepes whether you're in the mood for savory or sweet. I've had meals that range from veggies to chocolate cherry cheesecake so it really just depends on what mood you're in. Either way, I highly recommend Kelly's Cafe."}
{"text":"Crepes were so amazing...art on the wall...the owner was so nice...we will definitely be b"}
{"text":"Quaint place with Great crepes! Had a strawberry , chocolate cheesecake crepe. ... was one if the best I have ever had.  This place is so cute and colorful inside and had such a great atmoshphere. Love and will be going again! Crepe was also huge and able to share"}
{"text":"I love this place it's a very unique place to have an Brunswick in a land full of fast food restaurants. Kelly the owner is always very friendly and always creates creative and new ideas for her menu. A must visit!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp while visiting the world's friendliest people (insert sarcasm here) at Hollo's Papercraft. We had the Big Show & Strawberry/Spinach/Goat Cheese crepes which were awesome.  Friendly place with nice, cozy atmosphere. Kinda long wait for the food but worth the wait. Will be back next time we're in the area for envelopes."}
{"text":"The best coffee and crepe place in the greater Cleveland area.  If you haven't been to Kelly's, you really haven't experienced everything life has to offer yet.   Go today!!"}
{"text":"These crepes are delicious! You can choose from  a variety of options - sweet and savory. They also have beverages too. I would always stop here after going to the gym (oops). The owner is so sweet and the rest of the staff is too."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  My wife and I stopped in while visiting my family in Brunswick.
We ordered the ham, cinnamon apple and brie crepe. The apples were sprinkled with cinnamon and cooked, but still had bite to them.  Went well with the ham and brie.  Delicious!
We also had the egg, spinach, bacon and swiss crepe.  Fresh spinach and crispy bacon made for a perfect breakfast.  
Only disappointment was the place was empty on a Saturday morning.  C'mon people, put down your bagels and check this place out.  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Amazing crepes, friendly staff, love coming here whenever I'm near Brunswick. My family of four orders a different crepe for each of us, I sampled them all and they were all amazing! Price is good for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Waited 35 minutes for our crepes which I didn't expect because the place didn't look crowded. The chocolate cheesecake crepe was terribly bitter and I was expecting something sweet, seemingly obvious when you look at the name. It should be listed that the chocolate and cherries are very bitter (tasted like dark chocolate). I may return to try the Nutella crepe because the staff was nice."}
{"text":"They serve Mitchell's Ice Cream!!!

Yes this place has Mitchell's Ice Cream.  My wife and I love the stuff and living in Brunswick we don't have the access to it like we did when my wife was in Westlake.  

The service here is always great, greeted with a smile and warmth every time.  I really only go for the ice cream, but the place is super clean and cozy inside and has all the making of a good cafe, including crepes."}
{"text":"Great place for authentic crepes. My only complaint is that you need to go back to the counter to get your free refill of coffee. It would be nice to have a carafe of coffee instead of having to leave your meal to get more. My crepe got cold because I had to wait for two customers ahead of me. Otherwise, my crepe was good and I like that the atmosphere is homey and clean. Also, prices are competitive.  Check out the photos on YELP where you'll find the menus, hours, and see how delicious looking various crepes are."}
{"text":"We came upon this little cafe one Sunday when our first brunch choice was closed. We'd had our heart set on a hearty brunch so we were a little hesitant of Kelly's. Well I will say that we were very pleased our first choice wasn't open after enjoying these AMAZING crepes. It's a small space but very cozy. You order at the counter, grab a seat & they will bring your meal to your table. They have fresh brewed & crafted coffees & teas. All the staff were very friendly, as were all the customers. If fact when we arrived with our 1 and 3 year old one of the customers (a regular I could tell) jumped up & brought us a high chair.  
Now the food...ermahgerd. They offer sweet & savory crepes. Made fresh. My kids shared the banana, strawberry & Nutella crepe & I kept stealing tastes of it. I ordered a crepe with sausage gravy & egg inside. My husband had one with ham, bacon & sausage with egg & cheese. They are huge! And so so good! We are looking forward to going back to try more crepes. I'll probably bring friends so that I can try even more!"}
{"text":"It is so hard to find a good crepe anywhere! I am so surprised at all the love and care Kelly puts into these crepes! I have been here several times and I will be coming back as often as I can.

Kelly first of has a great selection of  savory and sweet crepes, plus she has single handily changed my perception about savory crepes . I always thought that there was no way a savory crepe and be better than a sweet one, however, Kelly made me one to try and convince me and she did! 

I have now tried one of every crepe she makes and I recommend the following:

Savory:
The Big Show
Egg, Pesto, Brie, + Spanish

Sweet:
Café Banana Split

Savory Yet Sweet:
Monte Cristo

All the crepes Kelly makes are awesome, these are just the ones I personally have liked the most, you must visit her and try them for yourself. Plus did I mention that the service here is awesome, friendly, speedy, and personalized; you cant ask for more. The best part of it all is that you can watch Kelly make the crepe right in front of you."}
{"text":"From the service to the food itself, my experience here was absolutely amazing. In fact, our first visit was so great that we've decided to make this place an every Sunday excursion!"}
{"text":"Had a crepe!  It was delish!  The people are cool, atmosphere is nice and it's a good local place to support!"}
{"text":"How cute is this little local place? The answer.... SO cute. It's seriously a hidden gem of Brunswick. Which I mean is pretty cool. The crepes are super tasty, and there are many different kinds. There is just about every possible combination that you could ever hope for when it comes to crepes. Feeling like you want something savory, guess what you can get a crepe that will fulfill that need. Feeling like you want a sugar coma? Yeah you can get you some of that too.  (If you are like me, and you love all things sugary I recommend the chocolate cherry cheesecake crepe or the banana split crepe)."}
{"text":"Fantastic locally owned place.  They helped me make a friend with a manager at a new clients large company!  The strawberry crepe received very positive review , and my tea was as ordered!"}
{"text":"Such a cute place!! The crepes were wonderful and I loved the environment. Kelly was cooking and her dad was helping out. Both very nice people. It was my first time here but I could tell this is definitely the type of place people come to on a regular basis...a few people came in and Kelly already knew what they wanted. After having the strawberry Nutella crepe, I can see why. I want to try the strawberry goat cheese and spinach one next time. My coworker had the French 'toast' and banana crepe and loved it as well.  Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Oh my god. This place as absolutely amazing.  The strawberry, bacon and Brie blew my mind.  This place blows the over priced la petite in Ohio city out of the water.  

He drinks were great too.  Chai latte and iced mocha.   I will definitely return

The service was a+ too.  The nice lady and her father were sooooo nice!"}
{"text":"Th crepes here are to DIE FOR! Everyone in your party will be happy since Kelly has concocted many options for sweet, savory with many ingredients. I opt for sweet everytime because the banana split is amazing with berries, bananas, nutella and THE STUFF! Unfortunately I can't give Kelly a five star review because she needs to work on her service.  Each visit the food comes out after 30 to 60 minutes so don't be in a hurry!  You may or may not get a coffee refill.  Hopefully, you are just as patient as I am and get a chance to devour these remarkable crepes!"}
{"text":"This place is INCREDIBLE. If you love crepes this is definitely the place to come. My recommendation: the spinach, egg, brie & pesto crepe. So tasty! I would give it 5 stars but it's reached the point it's so busy that you either can't find a place to sit or you're waiting an hour for some food. I think it might be time to expand! Other than that everyone is extremely friendly & the food does not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I love Kelly's! I don't live in the area so whenever I'm in town I try to make it. I took my boyfriend this time, who has never been, and while he was super boring with his order (cheese. That's it. Really? You come to Kelly's and you get cheese? It's fine. It's ok. Do you), it was still insanely delicious.

You really cannot go wrong with anything you order here. My usual is the little show, which to me is a perfect starter. 

Also, the crepes are large. I like to come and split with everyone so you can try a lot of stuff. Can't wait to come back! 

Great, now I'm thinking about it and I really want some crepes today..."}
{"text":"Gigantic crepes filled with any fruit or meat combo you could want. The food was great. The atmosphere is that of a hip coffee shop with art for sale on the walls. Breakfast for 7 with frappe's and juices all around was still under $10/ person. Wish we found it sooner."}
{"text":"I'm a first-time visitor. Six of us went here for lunch. The crepes were made with loving care. I say this because all our crepes were prepared to perfection (no overcooked edges/burnt sections).  The Monte Cristo was a delicious combination of ham, turkey and swiss cheese enveloped in a delicate crepe.  Raspberry preserves were on the side, a nice compliment to the savory meats.   No complaints from my friends says they were satisfied too. 

One table in the restaurant seats up to eight.  We called in advance & got it held for us. This place is a nice change from the franchise-type restaurants and its decor says so. If you can look past the down side of large parties not receiving their food at the same time, try Kelly's! I know of none other who serves crepes in the Cleveland area, even for brunch."}
{"text":"Awesome crepes! Savory, sweet, and savory-sweet! Nice, friendly and EXPERT crepe maker, Kelly has all the right ingredients at a great place for a meal, coffee and ice cream! Will make the trip to Brunswick (from the west side) just for her delicious food!"}
{"text":"Textbook definition of \"great local coffee shop that also makes a random food item (crêpes)\". Good coffee, friendly employees (I was offered a free refill on my coffee). Give it a shot! Places like this keep the American dream alive."}
{"text":"I have NEVER given a 5star review, until now! This was delicious!!! We ordered one sweet (Butter Me Up) and one savory (The Big Show) and they were both amazing!! 

The coffee was fantastic - and we are picky about our coffee and the people were very nice. Even the decor was nice, welcoming and cozy!! Loves the place!!

Definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"So my wife and I were on our Sunday morning brunch search when this came up on my yelp search. I was surprised as we looked at the menu, that not only had lots of great sweet crepes but a nice lineup of savory.my wife had a strawberry goat chesse and spinach that she said was very good and would surely get again. I had a savory crepe with ham bacon egg  and potatoes and maybe cheese,im not sure it was so full and a side of chipotle  spread to enjoy . A very casual place  and little wait to get your food, but they  did warn you before you even sat down. the menu has a great selection and worth coming back to for another sampling."}
{"text":"I love this place. Peaceful, good food, good coffee, and great customer service. I live for the man crepe."}
{"text":"Delicious crepes and such friendly people!  It's a quaint little restaurant serving tasty crepes.... so happy I found this little gem"}
{"text":"We travel a lot and we try to eat more on those local restaurants and this place is pretty nice. I highly recommend it to everyone and the crepes are awesome."}
{"text":"From the art on the wall to the different collection of coffee mugs to the variety of tables and chairs....this place is hands down one of our favorite spots. My kids (12 & 14) beg to go here almost every week after Sunday service. I asked them what they like about it and they said, \"Well obviously the food but also...it feels like home not a restaurant.\" I totally agree. We don't know Kelly personally but every time we visit it feels like we do. The staff is outstanding.

Let's be honest though, you read reviews on restaurants to find out about the food. The crépes are unreal! Our favorites are \"Little Show\" and \"Hayley\" because we are usually in the mood for savory and hearty. However, I also love the Nutella sweet crépe and it almost feels like it should be illegal for something to taste that good. Every single crépe I've seen delivered to the table looks like a work of art. 

Crépes are not fast food so it does take a while to get your food so don't visit when you are in a hurry. My advice: Don't always be in a hurry. Stop in. Enjoy the environment. Relax for a little while and then...enjoy!!

Kelly, thank you for creating such a cool place for my family to hang out together and...oh yeah...thanks for sharing your amazing crépes with us."}
{"text":"Fantastic crepes, from sweet to savory.  The owner is fabulous and will make you what ever you prefer!!"}
{"text":"What a hidden find!  Did a Yelp search on Saturday morning and wasn't disappointed.  So unassuming, yet so local/genuine.  A very cozy and welcoming environment indeed.  Came with my dad and had the Big Show and Ms P's savory crepes.  Outstanding!!  Enjoyed meeting Kelly and her father.  Watched the whole show unfold, chatted, and met a new friend.  Will definitely be back with family etc next time I am in town.  Keep up the great work, commitment to the community, and sunny outlook.  Refreshing to see quality and service still being warmly offered.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Brunswick establishments. The crepes are absolutely killer, and the different beverages are great too. If you want savory/breakfast, you can't beat the Big Show; if you want sweet, the strawberry and banana with Nutella and \"the stuff\" is my go-to. People always complain about the service being slow, but made-to-order crepes take time, and they are definitely worth it.

You can't beat the atmosphere; eclectic decor and local artwork. This is quite literally my favorite place to relax with a cup of coffee and a sweet treat. Can't wait to visit again soon!"}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this place so my Wife and I went there for breakfast this past Sunday.  We both love crepes and this place did not disappoint.  My wife had the apple, ham and brie crepe and mine had sausage, potato, onion, cheese and sausage gravy.  These crepes are not small..they are about the size of the tortilla Chipotle uses to make burritos.  The place is small and quaint with friendly service."}
{"text":"Have you tried \"the Stuff\"? So delicious! I have tried several crepes, but just a plain crepe with stuff and raspberry jam is my favorite. Takes a little while, but it's worth the wait! Bacon apple Brie is great, and the Monte Cristo is fantastic as well. But so yourself a favor and order a plain crepe.... Simply amazing! Great place, great food, and friendly service. Love it!"}
{"text":"Kelly's cafe is always amazing! The food, the drinks and staff! Kelly is always upbeat and friendly. I have never had a crepe that couldn't say \"this is my new favorite\" .. it's a hidden gem and you can't pick wrong."}
{"text":"Have I been hiding under a rock all these years? How I have not noticed this gem before?! To think I grew up in Brunswick...psh! Well, all that changed this past Sunday when my mom asked me \"Where would you like to go to breakfast this morning?\" I pulled out my phone, opened up my trusty yelp app and searched for breakfast joints in the B-wick.

The minute we walked in here, I knew we struck gold. It was so quaint and full of people you know are regulars. A friendly gentleman having his breakfast told us where to order. I suppose we looked a little lost. There were so many crepes to choose from! Savory, sweet and everything in between. They have an excellent tea selection as well. My mom had a sausage, egg, and cheese crepe which was to die for. I wanted to steal it from her! I had the strawberry, spinach, and goat cheese. It was good but it was a little more like a salad then a breakfast crepe. I wished the spinach was cooked and mixed in with the other ingredients.

I can't wait to go back and try more! Do I smell a new tradition? No....no that's just something wonderful from the kitchen."}
{"text":"Amazing Crepes! I have only had the sweet crepes but they are by far the best! 

I enjoy the mocha however wish it had less chocolate.

The only negative I would say is I wish the hours were longer or more consistent. I never really know when they are open I always have to check google.

Other than that if you like crepes I would definitely give them a try!"}
{"text":"Love the crepes and love the omlettes. Service can take a while being so small and stuff, but the environment is welcoming so an extended wait is no big deal. 

Quality food, tasty with healthy options."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  Excellent food and service in a warm atmosphere.  Everything I've eaten here has been amazing!"}
{"text":"Kelly rocks! She is a super sweet person and remembers me when I go in to get some crepes. It's quiet and cute inside. She sells local artwork on the walls and I think that is super cool. My boyfriend and I go there sometimes for crepes and smoothies which are always made perfectly! If you are a meat eater you have to try the pulled pork crepe! I have never had anything that I didn't totally love! I love all flavors of her smoothies! The dessert crepes are so amazing but are very sweet and best to share. Highly recommend Kelly's!"}
{"text":"It's a very cozy place to eat...Kelly is a very nice person. I Love Crepes and I found a good place to go to when I crave for one. I had t he Tiki Tam Crepe.. try it. It's mouth watering...:)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! We got very lucky at the time we went because it wasn't crowded. The girls working were personable and helpful and even joked around with us while we made our decisions. Awesome customer service here!!! There are many crepe selections between savory, sweet, and savory and sweet combos. I went with the Hailey van gogh (formerly known as the man crepe) and it was filled with meat and cheese and was delicious. The food does take a while but it is so worth it for a hot and fresh crepe! So many more options there to try so we will definitely be back. The crepes are large so bring your appetite!!! I really liked this cute and quaint little spot!!!"}
{"text":"Hot drinks are better than Starbucks and the crepes are as good as you will find anywhere.  If you have kids the PB&J crepes will have them asking to go back here all the time.  The smoothies are also delish.  Brunswick's best hidden secret."}
{"text":"Holy lucky find, Batman!

I didn't even know this place existed, and when I went in, it basically boasted all of my favorite details about coffee shops in one place.  Great coffee and desserts, spacious with lots of different places to sit (including comfy couches, YES), WiFi, scheduled events like open mics and other entertainment, a community bulletin board, a bunch of board games and stuff to read... I kinda just want to move in.

My cafe mocha was delicious, my barista was lovely, and I really enjoyed relaxing and reading in their well-lit shop.  On one of their comfy couches.

And the mural in the back is gorgeous.

So check out Insights if you find yourself down here in Brunswick, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I didn't know about this place for so long even though I live nearby. The crepes are amazing! The only negative is that they aren't open all day!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Brunswick. Kelly and her staff are so nice and inviting. The smoothies are amazing as well as the delish crepes. I only wish it was bigger and served mimosas for brunch :) - 

Kelly you should look into Lakewood/Ohio City real estate I think this would take off immediately there!!"}
{"text":"We are new to the area and were looking for a good place to have breakfast, based on the reviews we decided to try Kelly's Cafe.  We drove over 22 miles one way to get there, stood in line to order for about 5 minutes (couple in front of us were indecisive), when we approached the register to order, before we could say a word, we were told that it would take at least 45 minutes to be served (food to be ready).  We were baffled as the cafe was not full, there were places to sit, no line going out the door.  We've dined at many restaurants in the US and outside and this was a first for us.  Needless to say we walked out, and don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"Kellys is the best local cafe in the area. The crepes are fantastic, it's a great place to hang out and work or meet up with friends, and did I mention how yummy the crepes are?!? I've tried quite a few different ones, and am never disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Brunswick. We decided to check it out based on some of the other yelp reviews and we couldn't be happier!

First off the people working there are beyond nice and make the cafe such an inviting place to eat. Before we ordered our meals we were joking around and talking to the owner for a good 2 or 3 minutes, which was ok as it wasn't so busy at the time. 

I had the Monte Cristo crepe which was really good. I really wanted to try everything on the menu, but I guess I'll save those for another visit. I highly recommend Kelly's to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Kelly's is really good, which makes it really bad that it's located within walking distance from my gym. 

The cafe itself is small, with a few stools by the window, a handful of smaller tables, and one or two larger tables. I love looking at the local artwork that covers the walls while I'm waiting for my order. The crepes do take a little bit of time to arrive, but you can literally watch them being made right before your eyes.

I've been to Kelly's several times and can say that the service has been consistently excellent. I know some reviewers have complained about the wait time and slow service, but I've never had that experience. I tend to go to popular places at off-peak hours, though, so my experiences may not reflect the norm. Still, Kelly and all of her employees have been very accommodating and positive during all of my visits. I just get the vibe from this place that the people really love what they do.

The crepes themselves are delicious. I've tried both the sweet and savory crepes, and I was actually surprised that I've enjoyed the savory crepes the most. The sweet crepes are delicious, too, but sometimes the sweetness overwhelms me. They would be excellent for a dessert! My go-to crepe features eggs, spinach, brie, and pesto...a combination I would have never thought to put together before, but it's oh-so-delicious. I love the bright and tangy flavors of the pesto and melty brie nestled inside the soft yet crisp crepe. I know I should be more adventurous and order something new...maybe next time? Because there will definitely be a next time!"}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times. I love the atmosphere! Very welcoming and polite staff! And kelly the owner really knows how to cook! Thanks for all the great hospitality and amazing food! See you soon!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I frequent this cafe and, while some days they're busy and there's a little bit of a wait, it's totally worth it! The staff, especially Kelly, are very outgoing and kind. The menu has many options along with a special crepe of the day, and you can always create your own. With that being said, you won't go home hungry, the crepes are huge! They play great music and have awesome artwork to look at as well. It's a unique place and a great experience."}
{"text":"Kellys has the best crepes and coffee drinks you'll ever have! This place is a category of its own and my whole family has been going since it opened.. Kelly is wonderful and will blow anyone who walks into the door away!"}
{"text":"Great food... very tasty......seems very  loud inside, hard to carry on a conversation, long wait for food"}
