{"text":"A great find. Beer and food are excellent but what makes it different is the staff: motivated, knowledgeable and friendly. We'll definitely be back with friends and family"}
{"text":"A less expensive, unique, and modern version of hofbrauhaus house. The atmosphere was very cool, sitting among wood barrels and brewery equipment. The ginger beer was delicious, and you can bring your own beer growler to fill up and go. Our waiter was excellent, and so prompt. The food came out so quickly and was amazing. Beer, cheese, and cured meats, how can you wrong! So different, so worth a visit."}
{"text":"Great beer and food . Hidden gem. All food made from scratch they say. Ale house wings and specials are worth it"}
{"text":"Firstly, I live across the street in the muzzy's II business park and I am always very thirsty. Poured beer is the only liquid that can quench this never ending thirst. The beer poured at this fine pourary has made me, a boy that is pour, a rich man. No longer is Heidelberg a draft beer dessert. This is important to me because the trek is relatively short and these fine pours are long and complete. Right out my back door, I can get a brewed pour! Bottled beer everywhere around me, but only pours to drink at this pourary. Four score and seven pours ago muzzys II was the only pour, not anymore! Poured true and complete with depth and color. Pours that will leave you wanting more and more. A place for friends to relax and enjoy. A half, a full, or more they pour. Bring your growler and really get 64oz pour! No longer is a half pour half empty, but it has become half full! Through a pour, a pour boy has become a rich man. I was once that very pour boy, but I am now a rich full bodied draft drinking man!!!! No longer is a pour trapped in a glass bottle or can, beer runs though this place like water only usually can! The pour has been freed from bottles and cans!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a sunny Sunday and sat in the cover porch area.   Great place to grab a drink and pizza.    Started with the Hot Sausage Mac N Cheese followed by the Prosciutto Pizza. Both were good and expected.   Staff was helpful with pairing beers to our taste."}
{"text":"Visited on a Friday night with a group of six and was seated quickly. The guys in our group tasted a variety of beers and were pleased. The girls had Smooth Sailing- a white rum and ginger beer concoction which was very tasty and hard cider which was also very good - not too sweet.  As for the food - OUTSTANDING!  Started with goat cheese and ginger on warm toasted ciabatta. King pearl salad with lemon vinaigrette and cashews was unique and super fresh. Margherita Pizza was delicious. Had three kind of wings - butter garlic, buffalo and Aleworks which was sweet and spicy. All three were great!  Will definitely be back and will try the charcuterie!"}
{"text":"Unique beer selection, food menu is small but what we ordered was amazing. The service was prompt. Seating is first come, first serve and fairly limited. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife and some friends and I can easily say it is one of my favorite restaurants in the area not to mention the beer is really good. (If you like craft beers) All the food was delicious from the meat and cheese dishes, wings, to the sandwiches. The staff was very friendly as well. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came with a group of four for their grand opening. The beers ranged in style from a cider to a stout and everything in between. The cider was decent, not sweet but a bit tart and sour. I really enjoyed the dark star beer, I would have to say it was my favorite one of the night. They have some unique beers available and I'm excited to see what else they will have available in the future. Since this was their first day of service being open to the public-I felt that service was okay. Our server wasn't super knowledgeable about the beers and even though she wrote our orders down-she kept forgetting what we ordered. The food menu looks good-my friends ordered wings and they looked tasty-they even have a ghost pepper sauce for their wings that I can't wait to try! I will come back and give Insurrection another try as I always love to support local breweries-but it will probably not be for awhile in order to give them time to work on their execution and service."}
{"text":"This is a great local craft brewery. The beer selection always has some variety in styles. Beers are available in different half and full pours too which is always appreciated. Last time I was here I had \" pink yoga pants\". It was a 5/5. I've never eaten here though."}
{"text":"I came here 1 week after it opened.  The beers were good, adventurous, over all well done.  I'm an IPA fan and they did those well.  I loved the half pours because they gave me the option to try a large amount of the beer list without having too much.  They do 1/2 pours instead of flights.  So don't be disappointed if there are no flights, because the 1/2 pours are perfect....you can try so much more!  It wasn't overly crowded and the service was on point.  The cheese and meat board was a nice size and you can choose your own.  The wings were also pretty good.  The place is the start to something wonderful.    There is street parking only, so take it when you can get it!  Also, although the street sign says East Railroad Street, those of us from the South Hills know this road as Washington Pike coming from Bridgeville and Washington Ave coming from Carnegie.  I'm not really sure why the township renamed this road East Railroad Street because it parallels West Railroad Street.  As a person in the map making field....this is really odd.  You don't usually have east & west road names parallel to each other.   So just be aware, this is on the main drag."}
{"text":"Insurrection does it right!  With so many craft breweries popping up in Pittsburgh this should be on your 'to do' list.   They make small batch craft beers and are always making something new.  They had a nice double IPA, a Gosé a Farmhouse ale and American wild ale to name a few.  I've been to most of the breweries in the area (about a dozen) and this is one of the best!  Definitely some of the best quality beers around.  The place is new and very nice and clean inside.  Nice layout with a kitchen and bar on one side, tables in the middle and the Beer kettles on the end.  They also have a nice open out door shaded patio.  Also I like that they are open at noon on a Friday as most others don't open till 4 PM.  I didn't have the food but they had a nice selection on the menu is constantly updated and changing."}
{"text":"My new favorite brewery.  Beers and service are outstanding.  I tried the sampler of four beers then a full pour of the double IPA. Honestly, I would come back just for the cheese curds appetizer. Lots of vegetarian options.  Beer kicked my ass with flavor and ABV.  I will return..."}
{"text":"Get the halushki!!! We found this little brewery on Yelp, and we went to an early dinner there after a great day of shopping. My husband ordered a beer and said it was great. We ordered 5 wings with ale sauce, a side of halushki, and a margarita pizza. All were great and unique but the halushki could win contests...it was WONDERFUL. The only negative was parking and inside was actually very cold. They had some heaters where the garage doors were, but where we were sitting we could not feel them."}
{"text":"Simply the best wings in Pittsburgh, maybe even planet earth. Tastes like fried chicken but none of the guilt or carbs. Go with the AleWorks or one of the special hot sauces (ask as they are off menu) and pair with an Invisible Swordsman if it's on the menu. Enjoy, you won't regret it and you'll find it hard to get wings anywhere else afterwards. Sorcery is real and it's mastered in this kitchen!"}
{"text":"Great beer! Fantastic wings! The invisible swordsman is my favorite beer. The wings are super crispy and meaty. The Ale works sauce is my go to . Relaxed atmosphere and great service. Nice menu with some twists. This is our new go to bar."}
{"text":"Fabu!  Bartenders were on point, beer was delicious, and prices were fair.  We didn't get to try the food, but I hear its wonderful!  We've been wanting to try this joint forever.  I'm glad we were able to finally go (we live in the East End, therein lies the issue).  Dug the ambience.  Indoor and outdoor seating, kind of combined together.  The place is modern and rustic at the same time.  No doubt we'll be back for more!    And did I mention the bartenders are awesome!??!"}
{"text":"It's ok. The white pizza was good, and a lot of the other food looked good too. But I came here to try the beer, and it wasn't very great. The wheat was meh, one IPA was unremarkable at best, another was not good, and one tasted like kitchen degreaser."}
{"text":"Overtime, this place has improved a lot.  Nice workers, great food, and beers are ok.  A little pricey.  Would like to see more variety in the beers.  Most use the same yeast and oat blend and taste very similar."}
{"text":"Spent most of my Saturday evening here with friends this past weekend and we had a fantastic time! The weather was beautiful; they had their garage doors open in the back and the laid back atmosphere was exactly what we needed. Since we had a large group, we all met fairly early to make sure we had a table. It's a small place with only a few tables and a bar. By the time we left it was extremely crowded, so arrive early if you want a table.   With a large group, we were able to try a lot of what they had on the menu both in terms of beer and food. I understand they change their beer selection often, but I sampled The Invisible Swordsman which was a wheat American Ale and it was excellent. Everyone else in the party enjoyed Mosaic and Pretty Hop Machine. We were also thrilled to find out they have several wines from Pittsburgh Winery on the menu.   Aside from the great beer, their charcuterie menu is reason enough to stop here. They have an impressive list of various meats (many of them Parma) and cheeses to sample. Our party of 8 went through two large platters without shame. We also shared some snacks from the menu - the arancini, the pork meatballs and the short rib mac and cheese. The arancini (2 in a serving) was pretty good, although the marinara sauce served with it left a lot to be desired. The pork meatballs (2) were served with a tangy bbq sauce and also were quite good. I highly recommend the short rib mac and cheese. I wish there would've been a bit more short rib, but it was still a great dish to share. They also have salads, wings and several sandwich options - many of them using the meats and cheeses from the charcuterie menu.   Everyone in our party agreed this was a solid local spot to spend our Saturday evening. We hogged the table for quite some time, but our server was extremely friendly and accommodating for our group the entire time. As previous reviews mentioned, it is next door to the police station, but we all took Uber or Lyft so no need to worry! We'll certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I honestly cannot wait to come back! I loved everything about my experience here and let me explain why.  I came here on a Friday night and while there were many patrons, the space was reasonably sized so my large group didn't have to wait around for open seats. We ordered the AleWorks wings and the cheese curds as snacks. The food was the bomb and I would even consider coming back just for the food. The Aleworks wing sauce was a combination of sweet and spicy and it was such a wonderful complement to the wings. The cheese curds were crispy on the outside and melty on the inside. My favorite part of the cheese curds was the light flavoring in the batter that made them perfect without any dipping sauce. However, dipped in ranch elevated them to another level! I also very much enjoyed my drinks and love that they serve other local beverages (cider/mead/cocktails) and not just the beers they brew.   With such a great experience, I definitely will be back to try more items from their menu!"}
{"text":"They always have an excellent selection of IPA's on tap, but really every beer I've had is top notch.  I'd say they're in my top group of local breweries along with Roundabout, Hitchhiker and Voodoo.  The staff is really friendly.  It's small and can get crowded and it's kind of out of the way if you don't live in the South Hills, but definitely worth it.  Good food too."}
{"text":"Went to Insurrection right after they opened and had a wonderful time.  Great beer and great wings."}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere with great beer and hipster type bar food. Really awesome Wings, hot cheese bites, and haluski! Not a ton of seating but kid friendly. Staff is super chill!"}
{"text":"Awesome little spot hidden away in Heidelberg. The creativity of craft beer is abundant here. I've visited Insurrection a few times and there is always 3-4 new beers on the menu, ten total taps. Lots of hops and hop combinations being used. They also have a growing food menu and I think I saw a wood fire oven being installed."}
{"text":"Always different, interesting beers. Interesting, high quality, tasty food. Cool, friendly staff. Excellent music & inviting atmosphere.  Great place."}
{"text":"Since we always make it a point to try new breweries when we come home, we wanted to stop at Insurrection as we heard good things. We stopped in around 4-5pm and they were super busy. As a result, seating was sparse and it took a little while to reach the bartender for our drink orders.   Once we grabbed our beers, we sat near the entrance in the leather sofas (which actually worked out well as we avoided the noise/crowd and had comfier places to sit). We ordered the Phantom Limb and Dark Star Crashes. Both were pretty good!  We also decided we wanted to order some appetizers from their food menu. I waited for a bit at the bar until a gentleman came over to ask if I had been helped. I said no and that I wanted to place a food order. I ordered a set of buffalo wings and inquired about the BBQ sliders as it did not indicate how many it came with. He said there were three and I asked how much it would cost to add another one (since we had four people). He said he would give it to me for free since I had stood there waiting so long and because we had to sit at the entrance. That was really awesome and the food was actually pretty tasty!   Definitely a place to check out if you're in Heidelberg. Just beware they may be busy at peak hours and parking can be a bit of a struggle."}
{"text":"Have not had a full meal yet, but really enjoyed the charcuterie and beers. The Maggie's Farm cocktail on tap was delicious as well. Cool atmosphere and friendly staff; nice place!"}
{"text":"Went here last Friday night with the fiancé. It was a mixed crowd of mid 30s hipsters and professionals. We sat at the bar, the place was hopping! Very crowded, but it was still fun. I like how you can choose to have a half pour rather than a full. The food menu is concise and specific. We tried two different types of meat and cheeses which were presented on a butcher block cutting board with fresh bread and mustard. I had the cranberry mead which was very tasty! Didn't even taste like beer to me, which I like since I'm not a huge beer person. My fiancé loved all the beers he tried, and he is a beer guy! Matt, the owner, is very hands on and friendly. The other staff is also friendly and helpful. You can tell they're happy working there.   Main course... I had the mac n cheese with chorizo, it was very good! The fiancé had the dolphin steak sandwich with fresh chips which I stole of course!   Overall, a nice place for apps and beer in an area I would not normally go to. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Found an app for breweries, and I was surprised this was so close to work. Cool!  It's an old garage that has been converted to a brewpub. I walked in and I could smell they just brewed that day, I LOVE THAT AROMA!! I sat at the bar and waited a minute or two and the bartender asked me what I will have. I asked for a food menu and she obliged. I saw they had an extensive cheese menu, cool I thought.  I got a beer and it was average, I ordered a cheese platter and another beer that would fit the profile.  I must say, this is the first experience that a brewpub had such a cheese list, I was happy. However the beer is just average, I got to pale ales, hopped differently. They need some brown ales and some lighter beers to fit the cheese menu.  All in all, I will definitely be back. I hope they can improve the beer.  Edited Review: I have stopped in here since then & unfortunately their beers haven't changed much. Same malt base, different hops. I dropped it one star for that fact."}
{"text":"Perfect tap beers and perfectly chilled. There's nothing like a fresh beer straight from the tap out of a wall. The food and service was perfect and there was a very nice atmosphere in the place. Watch out for the wings as they don't tell you how HOT some of the flavors,are, as my mouth was on fire for 10 minutes. It was a scorpion something flavor if I recall."}
{"text":"Amazing selection of beer and scrumptious foods! Nice, quaint, cozy atmosphere with good service and a outside seating area. Definitely returning to try some of their wide variety of fine ales and food."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Finally made my way out to Heidelberg to support this new great local brewery.  We went on a Saturday early afternoon, so parking wasn't an issue.  The inside is very lovely, all very modern and clean.  Even though parking wasn't an issue, the place was packed.  There wasn't a table or barstool open.  There was a small bar that is further down the hall from the main bar that you can sit at, but it is isolated from the rest of the patrons.  After securing our drinks we made our way down to the only open spots, the bar in the hallway.  Lucky for us, a couple was leaving just about 5 minutes into our stay.  Matt the one owner, quickly flagged us to have a seat.    Once at the bar we procured a menu.  They have quite a Cheese & Charcuterie selection.  That alone took an entire page of options.  The rest of their menu is small but in a good way, the way you know they sell what's good and what works.  Lucky for us they were offering a Lenten special.  You have your choice of a grilled salmon or grouper and it came with housemade chips and mac n cheese.  I ordered the grouper and made a special request to swap the chips and pasta for a side salad.  Have to save my calories for the important things like several more drinks.  When it came out they were on buns, but the menu didn't state they were sandwiches. I wish it did because I wasted their bun as the fish was perfect without it.  Nice thick portion, grilled perfectly.  The salad was an array of mixed greens and veg with a housemade balsamic.  Food was great, as was the beer, and the price was on point.    After a couple more rounds, Brad the other owner made his way in and we had a chance to talk and see how everything was going.  From my personal perspective it all seemed very successful to me.  He confirmed they have been doing well and even had to close one week because they ran out of beer.  I am super happy this place is doing well and is so awesome.  I hope at some point they are able to add on, specifically an outside area, which would be great in the summer.  Either way, I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Awesome wings - crispy just the way I like them! Aleworks sauce was AMAZING! My husband and I tried a flight of the beers on tap - nice variety, solid beers. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very good hipster food. Palatable but pricey. Beer was excellent. Comfortable atmosphere, although small. Open air patio. Street parking could be a problem. Stuffed dates were fantastic."}
{"text":"Would get 5 but (and I know it's a small brewery) felt as though there could've been more selection/a variety in the styles of beer they had.   But the wings I got (aleworks sauce) we honestly the best wings I've ever had. The crisp that the wings had where second to none.   Go."}
{"text":"Insurrection is probably most known for their beers but I'm here to tell you, the food is where it's at!! Their menu is amazing, EVERYTHING is expertly delicious. They have an entire charcuterie menu where you can select your own cheeses and meats to make an incredible appetizer board. Their weekend specials are always perfect, the chipotle chicken tacos might be the best tacos I've ever had. Soups are also really tasty. Sandwiches, a hearty yes. Homemade chips, thumbs up. It's all so. good. The service is great as well. Insurrection's beers are really tasty too, don't get me wrong (pink lemonade pants and blueberry merph are my faves), but my husband and I go here for the food. You should too, and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Really cool atmosphere. Beers are very good, many of them IPA's and Stouts. Food menu is small but also very good."}
{"text":"If this wasn't RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO THE POLICE STATION, I'd give it the extra star. But with street parking and the police right there, it sort of discourages anyone who didn't walk there to go slow. Sometimes I don't want to go slow, if you know what I mean. But it is what it is. Just be warned. The space itself is nice! Small, cozy in fact. You walk down the stairs from street level and along a hallway to the bar. Nice clean and modern bathrooms too. I liked the feel of the place and even though it was packed, I felt like I could have stayed for a while (except I was driving - note the warning above!). The beer menu was enticing on all fronts and included about 6-7 beers and even some Apis Mead. I was able to order half pours (NICE!) and get a decent sample that way. The Stealing Hoppy Hours IPA was very tasty indeed.   We saw a lot of food come out while we sat there and man, those wings looked good and smelled heavenly. If we hadn't had that pizza at Spoonwood and that Jerky at Hitchhiker, I would have indulged! Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Wings and beer are still awesome.  I tried the Cuban sandwich and it was very tasty as well."}
{"text":"I adore this place, and not just because it's only a 5 minute drive away. Their beers are always great, the service is excellent - very attentive staff who are genuinely happy to see you and help you, and the food is delicious. I usually get a margherita pizza, but everything I've had is great. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Nice decor, tried 2 beers, they tasted exactly the same and were just ok. I'll give it another try someday."}
{"text":"Great rotating beer, tasty food, friendly service in a small Burgh suburban town. Beers rotate weekly so jump on it fast. Wings and pizza are good but the charcuterie board selection is A- wait for it....MAZING! Love this place"}
{"text":"Seriously great IPA selection -  they had a solid IPA called Heavy along with 3 more double/imperial IPAs.  Good pizza, nice people and SERIOUSLY great IPAs."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for some time as I drive by everyday on my way home, and I finally got the chance! We got there just in time before the crowd arrived on a Friday night and I'm so glad we did. The beers were good, I tried 4 (I think?) and there was only 1 that I wasn't a fan of and it wasn't even that bad. The food was also very good. We had wings, a pizza, and some sliders. Definitely too much food, but everything had alot of flavor and came fairly quickly. I will say that the service here was on top of it, they managed the increasingly busy dining room like champs and never let their tables sit for too long without checking on them. Seating is kind of limited, so I'd recommend going earlier in the evening if you don't want to wait. (I'm hoping their new addition includes more seating!)"}
{"text":"This is a small brewery located in a pretty quiet suburb. Their beer is quite delicious with a selection of different styles from double IPA to sour.   Their food is definitely on the awesome end of the spectrum when it comes to brewpubs. They have the usual pizza and wings, but everything has a twist toward the higher, healthier end.  The fried cheese curds, though maybe not healthier, are hand breaded and flash fried for a very melty and flacky basket of breaded amazingness. That paired well with my \"Aufstand w/ Blueberries\" which was a very bright, fruity Berliner Weiss.  This place has a lot of potential to expand their style into the city. They're doing a great job, and I'd highly recommend taking the drive out to have a beer."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer and some food one night after I didn't eat my meal at a previous dinner stop.  Service was very quick and friendly, the beers were good and the pulled chicken sandwich was delicious!"}
{"text":"After reading all the 5 star reviews, I could not wait to try Insurrection AleWorks. Majority rules! This place is FANTASTIC! 10 rotating beers on tap, and by checking out the previous reviews it looks like they rotate often.  We ordered a margarita pizza and buffalo wings, and omg were they delicious.... so delicious, we had to place another order of wings!  We sat at a table that was close to the kitchen, so we got to see all of the food that was coming out; everything looked incredible! I must try a sandwich next time!  The staff was nice and the place was clean and trendy looking. Lots of outside seating for warm weather. I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Food & beer  rocks!!!   Service even better!    .............................................................................just to make the review longer"}
{"text":"Possibly the best wings I've ever had. Ever changing beer list and they carry Soregels' Arsenal cider, plus I think they have one of their own liquors on the list as well. Definitely a semi dive bar vibe, perfect for a casual night or watching sports at the bar. Great homemade chips too!!"}
{"text":"Nice lil place tucked on the main road in Heidelberg/Carnegie. Had an excellent cheese plate and a pizza. The beer selection was good, according to my beer connoisseur friend. Find it to be a bit pricey for what is offered but enjoyed the atmosphere"}
{"text":"I stopped by here 2 Sundays ago with my wife and her parents for lunch.  We headed to Insurrection Ale works because we were looking for a brewery with food and I have had it bookmarked in Yelp for a long time.  It's located right on the Main Street in Heidelberg and so it was easy to find.  We headed in through the main door and went down a few steps to get into the brewery.  While walking down a hall to the dining room we could see some of their brewing equipment off to right.  The dining room itself consisted of a bar and an area which I am going to say used to be a patio but is now enclosed with plastic.  They have heat lamps for whenever it's cold and I imagine they can open some of it up whenever it's warm in the summer.  As I often do whenever I visit a new brewery, I decided to have a flight here.  The only problem with that is that they didn't necessarily have flights although they do have 5 oz tasters that you can order.  So I ended up making my own flight by ordering 4 of the 5 oz tasters.  The beers I chose were the panama red (hoppy red ale), total stealth (IPA), double secret (DIPA) and Springs in the floor (APA).  Out of the bunch I liked the Panama Red the most due to the brightness the hops brought the red ale and then liked the Springs in the floor the least.  For my entree I ordered one of their specials for the day which was the short rib confit taco.  The menu said it was short rib braised in rendered duck fat and their pale ale topped with fire roasted pineapple slaw, hot pepper relish, Romano and Parmesan cheese.  Our food here took quite awhile to get to us.  Our server actually came back and confirmed our order about 10 minutes after we had put in it to begin with and then after a somewhat long wait my wife's food was about 5 minutes behind the rest of the tables.  It didn't bother us as we were busy sharing vacation pictures but they still took care of us without us saying anything about it.  In any case I thought that my tacos were delicious.  The meat was moist and tender while the pineapple added some sweetness and the relish gave it a nice and spicy kick.  For someone like myself it was quite the well conceived dish as it ticked off the savory, sweet and spicy boxes.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Even though the food took quite awhile to get to us I found it to be really good and their beers decent as well."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've consistently had good beers here and it's always a good time. They post their weekend food specials on instagram (think wild boar, smoked brisket, etc), which I'm always excited to see. Sometimes they run out, so get there early! The people working here are super friendly and fun.  Oh, and you pretty much sit right next to all the brewing equipment. This is my local go-to spot. Definitely recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went here because i saw the good reviews. Everything is amazing! From the beer to the meat and cheeses. My boyfriends italian so he knows legit meat and cheeses and was thoroughly impressed as was i! Not to mention their drinks and food were incredibly cheap. Atmosphere is nice as well we will be back for many pens game!"}
{"text":"Beer, food, and atmosphere were all great! Live music was a nice addition to the lovely patio."}
{"text":"This place is alright  I was recommended to come to this place. They have 7 beers. I took a recommendation from the server. It was a dark stout that was alright. Not my cup of tea. However, they have a lot of IPA's on the menu. The place was packed when we were there.  We had the margarita pizza. The pizza was just ok. Not one of our favorites."}
{"text":"Wonderful beers and great food.  Interesting ambience, comfy & homey."}
{"text":"I went there for their opening night.  Their beers were generally good and very interesting, with some unique varieties such as sours that you don't see too often.  I was disappointed they didn't offer a flight option but they did let me taste a few so I could decide what I wanted.  The food was also decent, but not amazing.  I was really excited about the meatballs stuffed with cheese, but sadly they must have forgotten to stuff it with cheese :(  The service was the part that was most lacking. I called the meatball issue to the attention of the waitress but she didn't seem concerned and just walked off, not to return again.   I would've been ok if they would have just brought some cheese to put on top at least.  She also forgot one of our drink orders we had to remind her of, then she still brought the wrong thing even though she had written down the original order.We had to get her attention many times before she could finally bring the check. It took about 30 min from when we first asked her to finally get it.  She seemed to have trouble using the machine to check us out and there was only one machine that could be used at a time.  She didn't apologize at all (not about the meatballs lacking cheese or about the delays or forgotten drink orders) until the very end when she finally produced the check and she took the meatballs off of it.  I know it was their opening day though so they are probably still working out some kinks, so I still hope to go back and see how they do."}
{"text":"I really like this little local brewery located unexpectedly in the middle of Heidelberg. The beers are always delicious, and the charcuterie experience is super fun. They have a few pages of the menu dedicated to charcuterie options (complete with flavor descriptions) and you can mix and match to create your own charcuterie board. The food is decent; I wasn't too impressed with the pizza, but the sandwiches have not disappointed. I have yet to try any of the weekend specials but I've seen some mouthwatering descriptions on the specials menu and on their social media pages. This place is pretty tiny, so best bet is to get there early or during an off-peak time to get a seat."}
{"text":"First visit to this microbrewery was great! Great food, great service, everyone was friendly. Very cool, you can see where the beer is fermenting through glass windows. Appetizers of fried cheese curds, which were delicious!!!!! Light crunchy batter, top quality stringy cheese, dipped in Ranch dressing, again, delicious!!!! An order of Garlic butter wings, again the coating was crunchy, plenty of Garlic and butter, really good!!! An order of Scorpion BBQ wings, sauce was decent, about a 6-7 out of 10 on the heat scale, good crunchy wings. A spicy Italian hoagie for dinner, a generous portion of Italian meats, fresh cut mozzarella on a fresh Italian roll, what you expect of a good Italian hoagie!!!! A side of decent Mac and Cheese rounded out a great meal. Two local microbrews to wash it down, definitely will go back!!! Great little place in Heidelberg!!!! I'm not a big connoisseur of beer, that's why I included a picture of their beers. Stop in and enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Cool little brewery! Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the service. The waitress barely checked on us however it was busy and looked like she was the only one waiting tables so not a huge deal but could of been better. Now let's talk food...they have wood fired pizzas! My boyfriend and I shared the Margherita pizza, Amazing! I loved it and it was a great size to share. Our friends got buffalo wings which smelled really good so we had to get some to go before we left. I'm so glad we did because they were also delicious, prob the best buffalo sauce I've had in a while. We also got the dry rub wings and they were seasoned really well. I don't usually love dry rub wings but I was surprised at how good they were. I'm a cheese lover so I was really excited that they offer a big selection of cheeses and meats to make your own cheese and charcuterie board however the list was overwhelming. I was unsure of what to choose so I didn't get any but I saw one come out of the kitchen and it looked great so I will be back to try. They have about 7 different beers so you will def be able to find one you like. 2 weeks was my favorite."}
{"text":"Really interesting & very busy new brewery in Heidelberg. It was our 3rd stop on a Saturday South Hills brewery adventure so we were pretty excited to see they offered half pours of all their beers. Since it's literally next door to the Heidelberg Police Station, half pours seemed prudent.   Loved the Suppression #3 Double IPA (I wasn't driving!). My husband had the Stealing Hoppy Hours American IPA. Both were really delicious.   We'd already eaten but the food coming out of the kitchen, especially the wings, looked and smelled delicious. Don't be surprised if you see several policemen in there sampling those wings!!! I know we'll be saving room for them next time."}
{"text":"Insurrection is a great brewery in the middle of Carnegie and Bridgeville. It's definitely worth checking out. The bartenders and wait staff are super nice and let you try tastes of beers on tap. They always have a good selection of beers for all different tastes. Their food is very good too! It can get a bit crowded in the winter but I believe they solved that challenge by adding an outside area that is covered/sealed and heated for the winter, thus offering more seating."}
{"text":"I'm surprised I haven't heard more buzz about Insurrection Aleworks. We stopped here for lunch during the holidays and I'm glad this place is near my house. We ordered a few tasters each and I was impressed by the flavors of the beer. My favorite was the mujer del espacio, a juicy tasting pale ale and my friend loved her pastiche, lemongrass flavored ale.  The best part of our visit was definitely the Italian pizza...  I will definitely be back to try some of the other food. The toppings, crust, and sauce were all perfect."}
{"text":"Really like this place.  Stopped in for a quick lunch.  We sat at the bar and service was great.  They were doing some work to some of the tanks behind us.  The place is small and the outside area is completely closed with some overhead heaters.  The menu is a little different than my last visit.  Ordered the Sausage pizza that has posted jalapeño, banana and green peppers with Parma Mild Italian Sausage that is cooked in a wood fired pizza oven.  The pizza was very good with a spiciness from the peppers.  The crust is a little thicker, not paper thin and very tasty.  Great with one of their beers."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Cool place we stumbled upon! We had the margherita pizza, wings, and pork sliders. All were fantastic!"}
{"text":"What a local gem!!!  If you enjoy legit micros combined with pride and a cool, laid back venue - definitely worth your time and \"investment\"."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here on a beautiful Saturday afternoon for a few beers and a snack.  He had a coffee stout and I had their imperial IPA.  Both were very good - the coffee stout was rich and full-bodied with a great coffee flavor and my IPA was just the right balance of hoppy and fruity to be refreshing.  We ordered some cheese curds and wings to munch on which were also very good.  They had the outside patio open, so there were a lot of seating options and availability.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"This is the second time that we came here to get some good beer and food and all I can say is I wish they were closer to home for us.     We were hungry and on our way home back from a night at Wheeling so we knew we had to stop by.  The last time we were here we didn't order off of their main menu.  It was around Lent and we got their special that was a grilled Salmon.  It was great.  This time we studied the menu on our way here and had some ideas on what we were going to order.         When we got here they went over their specials for the day and they were really intriguing.  I ended up ordering their brisket tacos off of their specials for the day menu. Oh my they were mouthwatering.  I could have eaten 4 of those and axed the chips.  I ordered a good wheat beer here and my wife got a IPA.  The beer is very good and it just keeps getting better.  Matt and Brad know what they are doing here and I know they will be setting the bar even higher the next time we visit.  Too bad they aren't closer for us or we would be here weekly.  If you haven't tried out Insurrection yet or if you haven't been there in a while make sure to stop by soon.  Great beer and great food!"}
{"text":"First time here and not disappointed at all. Decor is rustic and well put together. Eager and friendly staff. Prices are so reasonable. Pours from 6 ounces and up. Dark Star Rises is a porter with roasted coffee from Allegheny Tea and Coffee Exchange. So good! They also carry the Pina Colada mead from Apis; sweet and refreshing. Brain Bucket and Gunga Galunga are also delish. No food this visit but definitely next time around."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly staff, good food, oh yeah, and incredulously imaginative and tasty brews; what is not to love?  Enjoy IPA's?  Try:  Gunga Gulunga, Bob Ross, El Stoopido, Happy Little Trees... Yeah so they don't do these brews anymore.  Lost my interest.  Still a cool place."}
{"text":"Stopped in to sample the beer and the food today. The beer was all amazingly drinkable and at an awesome price. The food was amazing. Tried the arincini,prosciutto sandwich, smoked brisket mac and cheese and the wings. Each one was better than the last. Had better food here than at most classy higher priced restaurants. The choices for the charcuterie trays was phenominal, completely blew my mind. I would venture back here just to eat the food honestly even if there was no beer! I will be going back for sure. These guys hit a home run. Server was excellent as well."}
{"text":"This is one of my husbands favorite places.  The beer is always unique and flavorful, with a great chill atmosphere.  We both love the wings especially the ghost pepper. The service was great and the feel of the restaurant is so chill. I just wish the menu was a little bit bigger."}
{"text":"A nice variety of craft brews that are not your average beers.  I had the full flight of today's options - the Gose and the Mead were remarkably good!  The stout was complex and fresh.  Their hopper options were still nicely balanced with a great nose.   They had an impressive selection of cheeses and charcuterie - We didn't get to sample many, but the ones we had were delicious.  Service was a little slow, but well crafted brews are worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The Cuban sandwich was delicious and the beer selection was great.  It was nice but not over-the-top trendy."}
