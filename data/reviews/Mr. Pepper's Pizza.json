{"text":"Reviewing because I didn't have an issue with the food quality as other reviewers have noted. The pizza I ordered tasted fresh and tasty. The toppings however were spinach and chicken which are both considered premium there. I was a bit disappointed with the quantity of spinach considering we paid double for it and it's not an expensive ingredient. The lady behind the counter was very friendly and allowed my preschooler to get an up close look at the oven which made the wait more enjoyable. They should consider a park bench or picnic table out front as the unit was extremely hot inside. I would give them another try if we are in the area and the kids need a bite."}
{"text":"Went today. It's been a while. Now I know why. No cheese on old pizza. Owner keeps tax on cash purchases. Will not be back."}
{"text":"We had a pizza, and cabbage rolls from here tonight. The pizza was actually really good, especially for it's price! The toppings all had good flavour, and it was just an overall nice pizza! My bf and I agreed it was surprisingly good! 
I'm Hungarian, so I know cabbage rolls. These ones were tomato based, the filling was mildly spiced (meat and rice), and the sauce was a bit too acidic, but really, for what I paid... They were pretty darn good. I'd go back just to have those when I'm craving cabbage rolls.

We will definitely be back. I'm curious about those pierogies!"}
{"text":"This place used to be our go to spot for pizza. Since they've changed owners the quality is terrible- undercooked, toppings scarce and scattered haphazardly. Won't be back. Shame because we live close."}
