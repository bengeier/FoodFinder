{"text":"Let me start off by saying that this is the first review I've ever written. This place is so bad that it makes me want to sit at home on a Friday night and write a bad review about it so I can warn the rest of the world about its horrendous-ness. The waitresses are bitchy and awkward, they stand over you while you're eating and make you feel uncomfortable. The buffet is actually TINY, the trays are arranged in 3 rows and  3 columns so that when you reach the very back tray you end up spilling half the food into other trays...which probably explains why the place was dead empty when we came in (which was, by the way, during regular dinner time)... usually when a place is dead, that's the first warning sign. Also, the food isn't very good. I dont mind spicy food, but not when it all tastes the same regardless of the colour... Aside from the same tasting but different color sauces, you have a choice of rice, potatoes or veggies... really limited for a buffet. It made my stomach hurt the entire day and I didnt even eat that much... its poison! And why do they call themselves \"gagan SWEETS\"?? Did you know that their dessert consists of oreo cookies? ( I kid you not). The website is really deceiving b/c they have beautiful pics of various desserts, but that's not part of the restaurant at all.... that's a separate bakery but in the same space.  Bottom line, the only time you should ever go here is if you want to experience a truly terrible 'restaurant', or play a practical joke on someone. otherwise, STAY AWAY!!"}
{"text":"The best Indian food in Vaughan. Simply fingerlicking. Cheap yet amazingly delicious. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I went with my boyfriend, we found this place on Yelp and so glad we did.  The food was delicious and there was so much selection and that's saying a lot considering we are both vegetarians.   The service was so fast and friendly and she gave us a tour of the buffet telling us what everything is.   When the bill came we assumed they made a mistake. It was $25 so my boyfriend asked her if she forgot to charge for two people. Nope, it's $10 per person for a huge feast we didn't even get try everything!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My Go-To indian joint ... to the reviewer that was complaining about the   \"racist\" lady owner, maybe you caught her on a bad day?-- I am not punjabi - indian at all ... but I find her so nice and friendly whenever I go in, I'm a regular visitor, so she knows me, and like I said, she's so nice/friendly, always greeting me with a smile.  Anyways.. this is my go - to place, because first off it's a BUFFET under 12 bucks for lunch, everything is vegetarian and they have a good variety selection of desserts.  My favourite, malai kofta is here, and they serve great fresh naan, ( - THE BEST COMBO for a main dish)  and as I said ***DESSERT*** table: rasmalai, GULAB JAMUNmmmmmmmmm, jalebi, carrot/ apple halwa, rice pudding are the highlights  The interior is nice, clean, modern, washrooms clean  Food is Always Fresh, tasty, flavourful, wonderful   Front counter , has more take out desserts and special drinks to order like mango lassi etc.  I am always satisfied coming here, this is just my Go-To joint in general for some Bombastic food."}
{"text":"Went here with 2 friends and had a great time.  The staff were amazing and they made fresh naan and it was delicious."}
{"text":"By far the BEST Vegetarian Indian in Toronto.  Not only is the buffet filled with distinct and delicious dishes, the food is never over cooked, which is amazing for a buffet style restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice indian place. I took takeout from here. They have this nice box where you can choose your curries, posted picture. No major likes or dislikes. Ambience is decent, their faloda is really good but one of the ladies who work there seems preoccupied and just wants you out of the place as soon as possible.  ==============================PRIYA======="}
{"text":"Despite the name this place offers more than just sweets. A rare find in terms of all vegetarian curry. It may look like meat pieces in the curry but they are cheese! All very delicious and great price. Very authentic flavours too."}
{"text":"Gagan is a very good restaurant to visit.  Owner and other members are professional and curtious. Delicious food and nice ambience."}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled upon this place randomly and were so impressed. The staff were so nice. There was a large variety of fresh, delicious vegetarian dishes; everything was so good and flavourful! I'm always looking for good vegetarian options in the city and wish I knew about this place sooner! Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This was my second time to the Gagan Sweets location in Vaughan.  Decided to not go for the buffet and order a la carte.  BIG mistake.  I am allergic to coriander (cilantro) and I never have problems customizing my order so that there is no cilantro in my food at other Indian restaurants.  At Gagan, this seemed to be a HUGE ordeal.  When placing my order I made it clear to the waitress that I was allergic and she seemed to understand.  When the food came, big surprise it was full of cilantro.  When I informed the wait staff, they seemed unapologetic but took the meal away.  The waitress returned a minute later and said \"I tried the best I could, but I can't get it all out\".  Clearly they have no regard for their customers and don't care if you have an allergic reaction in their restaurant.  They simply take the food item you order a la carte from the buffet and slop it in a bowl for you.  I asked if the chef could make a fresh meal without cilantro, but the waitress said it wasn't possible.  What's the point of ordering from the menu then?? On top of that they didn't seem to care that I would be unable to eat the meal or had an allergy.   Worst customer service I have experienced, and mediocre tasting food at best (whatever I could manage to eat of the other dishes that don't come with cilantro as per recipe).  Lots of other Indian restaurants (including all vegetarian) to choose from in the GTA, so save yourself and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Maybe it just isn't to my sweet tooth but after going up the 400 to try a restaurant I'd heard good things about my friend and I came in here for some dessert.  We stood in front of that big glass case & the super helpful lady took us through the various options, describing what each one was. Honestly, to me, most things that were decent tasted the same & after a few bites I didn't want to eat them either. Maybe that's the key to staying trim? Have sweets that you don't want to eat anymore after a few bites? I dunno.  Honestly, I'm only giving this place 3 stars because of how amazing and helpful the staff was and how beautifully kept the store itself is. Beyond that? I've literally no reason to ever walk in here again because not one thing I ate from there made my face light up with delight and drive me to want more. At least I tried it though, right?  Note: I did notice people sitting down at the tables for what I assume were full on meals but didn't go do so myself. Maybe it's better if you're not doing take-out? I don't know how it would be but can't discount the concept either."}
{"text":"Decent prices and alright selection of vegetarian food. AYCE is $13 (update they raised the prices to 14), or you can get a big plate for around $8 (update, it's now 10). Both come with a big serving of naan (plain or garlic). They also have other take-out containers for $3-10. I liked the paneer korma and the eggplant stew. The sweets were good too.  It's by no means the best indian food I've had, not even close, however I prefer this option over the food court inside the mall."}
{"text":"Wow, for an all veg restaurant this place was great!! Loved the food, only thing is I couldn't tell you what half the food was, because nothing is labeled.  People with allergies would have to be very careful or ask.  There samosas are amazing and a reasonable price!  We go there often just to lick up samosas for family events."}
{"text":"Dropped by at 8pm for dinner was excited so see the variety on the buffet. However after tasting several dishes I was disappointed as the food was out on the buffet to long and the taste was off. The potatoe fritters and aloo dishes has started turning sour and others some dishes has to much pepper for kid consumption. Also the salad was wilted and soggy.   This was not our first visit so expected the same quality but as I disappointed.   Also the service was slow with only 3 tables to manage.  Water did not come until 10 minutes into the meal and it was not refilled until the end.  Left with an upset stomach and kids still hungry!"}
{"text":"Soooo good! I once bought an Indian vegetarian buffet voucher through Groupon but never actually ended up using it. I didn't think I could eat a whole meal without meat and enjoy it. But that was because I never had Gagan Sweets! For the value and flavors, and friendly and warm service, Gagan Sweets gets a perfect 5! Food was hot, there was garlic naan!!! and a decent fruit selection. I tried a little bit of all the hot food last night so I had no room for the salad or sweets. There are spciy and non-spicy options... Next time I go I will read the labels and stick with the non-spicy options more. :) I will definitely be back. I wouldn't have known of this establishment if it weren't for my friend's birthday yesterday. It's located at a small plaza near Vaughan Mills, so next time you're in the area, don't forget to stop by Gagan Sweets!"}
{"text":"Delicious food...Despite being a vegetarian restaurant it has a lot of variety..I especially liked their Shahi Paneer very very creamy..loved their dal makhani reminded me of my mom's home cooked food...the food did not have a restaurant taste which made it amazing! Also, they serve hot, fresh naan to your table and they even prepared the plate for the kids which I thought was really sweet!   As far as the venue is concerned it looked like a traditional sweet shop with different sweets behind the counter and reminded me of India LOL...amazing customer service! she was pretty much the only person on the floor (server, host, cashier, everythingg) but despite that she was able to attend to everyone and was a sweetheart! Very nice atmosphere...its a small cozy place :)   The only thing that I personally did not like was the Masala chai...it was very watery and I like it with more milk..maybe next time i will specify that but other than that loved it  GREAT PRICE!! $11 for the dinner buffet...ohhh and really good gulab jamun!"}
{"text":"Delicious indian food. The samosas are so delicious and are only 2 for 1$! The buffet is nice too if you want a variety. The eggplant dish is the best! Great vegetarian option! I love the desserts here too. The service is good too. They are nice and make you feel welcomed."}
{"text":"I recommended this place so highly that close friends of mine fell in love with their somosas and began buying them. Until they got one that was bad and it made them all sick with food poisoning....sorry gagan, you were sweet but my tummy is sweeter."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is extremely horrible!!!! I will warn you the waitress touches your food with her hands. Would only recommend buying your own sweets that all nothing more ..."}
{"text":"Gagan Sweets 100% Pure Vegetarian resides in one of the exterior plazas of Vaughan Mills.  The closest competition would be Bollywood Bistro but it can't really be in direct comparison as Bollywood does Meats while having a smaller dining/buffet area as well as one important factor.  3.5 *Star*  SWEETS, Indian sweets to be exact where if you've familiar to Bhojan Bhandaar Sweets & Restaurant this has a similar concept however the decor here is simply fab and the young/new waitresses are friendly and full English speaking.  Even the women behind the Buffet counter was super friendly to get me rice items and introduce me to a small scale Mongolian Grill type Grill featuring 3 items.  The Buffet area isn't the most spacious but features your usual Thali style items of Paneers, Spinach, Dough, Naan, Rice, a few warm Sweets, a good selection of cold Salad items, Cakes, etc...  I didn't find the spices in the dishes overly spicy but there's definitely hints of it.  I had the Lunch Buffet($7.99) which seems to be just a dollar more than Bhojan Bhandaar while BB isn't a AYCE Buffet, but still filling Thali portions.  Gagan Sweets is probably my go-to for Indian Vegetarian within the Vaughan/Maple area.  You can also get take-out as you receive a plastic container and go to the Buffet to dish up some food.  Sweets, yes the Indian style Desserts are in a large Cake Display case and if you don't pay attention. You would of thought you went to Dessert Trends instead with that scale of fridge selection.

{"text":"Good indian vegetarian resturant. Food is good and they make tawa rotis as well! If you are veggie and like indian food this is best place in vaughan for you. Palak paneer and kadi are my favourite dishes."}
{"text":"Went for lunch service was ok no napkins, or paper towels in bathrooms, was clean, about food not to say much bland ate chana bhatura very oily, no taste in chana. Low quantity. No salt no spice will not be going again. Thumbs down."}
{"text":"I went to this place... looked nice and clean.. tempting buffet menu but didnt try.. ordered cholay bhaturay instead which the owner recomended.. first of all it was not bhatura instead it was puri.. and the cholay tasted really bad too sweet and few channas were soft and tender and few of them hard as rock. I specifically asked for salad and achar which shud come with it complimentary. I was told its inside in cholay, there was literally one piece of onion and 3 pickle carrots that too drowned in chollas. Did not like it. I had high hopes and thought will try other things from the restaurant but now i dont think i will go back."}
{"text":"Food was alright though very oily, even the roti was covered in oil. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Atmosphere and restaurant was clean but I felt uncomfortable for the staff to touch the food with their hands. For $13 for all you can eat, I walked out the restaurant very full."}
{"text":"Yes! I wish I had known this place existed earlier!  Gagan Sweets is an AYCE 100% vegetarian Indian buffet. They have a hot table of maybe 5-6 sauces, two types of rice, fresh & crispy samosas, spring rolls (I think!), garlic/regular naan, and a complete cold table of desserts and fruit.  I really, really liked their palak paneer, matar paneer, chana and samosas. The paneer chunks are huge and the samosas are sooo good. They are crispy and hot and full of love. My coworkers brought in a few trays for a potluck which is where I learned about Gagan Sweets. The sauces that accompany them are out heavenly. I have to admit, after three plates I was feeling pretty bogged down but my wallet screamed the opposite. $13 for AYCE dinner is hard to complain about.  You may ask why I'm holding back a star. It's because their naan bread that day wasn't my favourite. I'm going back on Friday so we'll see if it was a one-off situation. It was more like a crispy, thick-ish pita/flat bread than a doughy, hot naan bread.   I'll report back!  UPDATE: the naan is the same as before. Still a 4/4.5 star from me only because I've had better naan elsewhere. But don't let this update stop you from visiting; it's still delicious. You'll see me frequent here regardless."}
{"text":"Very good vegetarian Indian buffet place. Good service and lots of options. That is all.  Now I have to add more words in order for Yelp to post this review!!!"}
{"text":"Not that great food but with limited Indian food choices in area, this becomes the default option for many specially vegetarians."}
{"text":"3 check-ins in 4 days. Granted I am traveling to Toronto from US but I can't seem to get enough of it. I swear I have not have such great Indian food and especially desserts in a long long time. And at that price it's a steal. I can't wait to be in Toronto next time and be eating to my hearts content at this place. It's as awesome as it can get. Go for it."}
{"text":"Really my meat lover Yelp friend taking me to a vegetarian restaurant for lunch buffet ($9.99)! And we both having a great time at Gagan Sweets!  I usually not into eating buffet or food that are under a heated lamp but what they serves here are fresh and tasty. We have   Shaahi Paneer Palak Paneer  Malai Kofta  Dall Makhni Matar Paneer Aloo Gobhi Channa Masala and more... and of course freshly made naan bread.. (the nice lady even got me some spicy garlic version!)  Usually I am not into Indian dessert but Gagan Sweets here are just so good.. not overwhelming sweet as I can really taste the ingredients they used  Gulab jamun Chikki Payas and more....  Really warm and family vibe here! I feel like I am eating at someone home as our waitress (thought not the young/new one) treated like we are one of the family guests and make sure we are happy and well fed!  I definitely would be back when I am in the area, I would even go out of my way if my Yelp friend need some lunch companion to chill out and stuff our face with food!"}
