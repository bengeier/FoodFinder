{"text":"Sunnie and Le Chateau (looking at the other side of New Kennedy Square) are both actually owned by the same owner. However, Sunnie seems to have better variety of buns.

Price is higher for this place, but you get what you pay for. The quality easily surpasses Chateau, Hung Tao, and the third one inside the mall. It's easily my favourite bakery place in the surrounding area, let alone the mall itself."}
{"text":"The customer service is so nice at this location! They have competition of other bakeries nearby and is located close to the supermarket. Best bargain for bubble tea here and it is definitely delicious."}
{"text":"First time at this bakery and i had gotten a custard bun. It tasted sweet and custardy, i would defiantly go back and try their coconut buns! 
Only downside is that its in a really busy plaza
Also i had to ask for my correct change back as i got short $1. They were pretty apologetic for it so it was ok. Honest mistake."}
{"text":"Sunnie has the same owners as Le Chateau but I love coming here much more!

I always get their little cakes, my favourite is the egg white one SO. GOOD. It's super soft and moist and when you microwave it asdfghjkl basically heaven.

They have good deals for buns, buy 6 and it's tax free or if you go before closing its only $2.50 for 3 buns! Super good deal!! :D

They also have handmade fish balls and meatballs! Super Yum~ I don't know what it is about them but they just taste really good XD

Service is also vey nice and friendly! Overall a nice place to get buns for a good price!!"}
{"text":"Sunnie Bakery is one of those more modern Chinese bakery.

Selections here are pretty good with a mix of Chinese traditional pastries or Chinese Western pastries.

Everything is 20% off but their price point is a higher than the no frills traditional bakeries as my Chinese version of a Portuguese tart is around $ 1.16 even with 20% off.

If you want variety give Sunnie Bakery a try... but if you want to stuff yourself with cheap $1 for 3 buns, go somewhere else!"}
