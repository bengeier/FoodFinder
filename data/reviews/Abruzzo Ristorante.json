{"text":"Food was good. Went during lunch time.  However it was too pricey for the quality and service in my opinion. Went during lunch and the waiter made it sound like he was doing us a huge favour by agreeing to split the bill which was a bit annoying."}
{"text":"Amazing food, the veal tortellini was a perfect dish. The restaurant and staff are great. A little pricey but you leave satisfied and full. Recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is good and good portion too! But the hostess was rude; must be having a bad day! The service was okay only!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious, the wine list is extensive, the service is fantastic.  The only downside is that it is a little cramped inside, not the place for intimate conversation. The owners also appear to change their hours and days open on a regular basis. Just a few weeks ago I called to make a reservation and the automated message said \"we are on summer holidays and are closed..\""}
{"text":"This will always be one of my favorite Italian places. Cozy, friendly staff, delicious wine, and the portions for the pasta are generous, so you have great leftovers for another day."}
{"text":"our waiter was rude, ignored us, and replied with sarcastic undertones to everything. He wrecked our date night and left us feeling unsatisfied.... Which sucks because THE FOOD WAS AMAZING. if the atmosphere wasn't ruined by the snooty service the night would have been perfect."}
{"text":"Went with my wife looking for a fine Italian restaurant but could not be so mistaken. The waiter went to the limits of trying to embarrass me in front of my wife because I did not want to have wine with my dinner. This low sales tactic might work for first dates but being married for 20 year both my wife and I noticed the ridiculous situation the waiter put himself into. If this was not enough, I got sick the next day. Never will go back to that restaurant again, and would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"The food was exquisite and we had amazing service tonight. I can't believe this was my first time at Abruzzo in the 20+ years they have been in business. You have to try the veal tortellini, it was one of my favourite dishes."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now-its a favourite lunch spot of my more senior coworkers (senior in career, not senior like old folks).  This is one of those places that was probably super awesome 25-30 years ago. Now, it is just \"meh\".  Maybe its because we've come to expect more from restaurants-I'm not sure. I want to like this place as it is kind of charming and rustic in its decor. But after several visits, the food and its bland, uninteresting style just makes me feel indifferent. The best thing I've had there is the soup and it was part of the daily special. I like soup but I would never choose a restaurant, especially a more \"fine dining\" restaurant, on its soup.  The entrees are all okay. The food has always been warm, not hot and the flavours mild and somewhat forgettable. I ordered chicken something one time and it arrived with those fake grill marks on them-not expected and not overly tasty. The pasta is always a little over cooked too. Everything has been edible but nothing has been remarkable.  The service is decent but again, nothing to write home about. Considering the prices (on the higher end of moderate) I would expect excellence in at least one category but have yet to experience it."}
{"text":"Honestly, Abruzzo is one of the best Italian restaurants in Calgary and I can honestly say this because I have been to them all!  Located on the corner of 4th Street and 8th Avenue SW in downtown Calgary's west end, this little house turned restaurant is simply amazing and delivers an exquisite Italian dining experience to say the least!  Abruzzo is a little piece of Italy. Their absolutely gourmet Italian food is to die for!  What should you get? Anything we did!  Cannelloni - if you like melt in your mouth veal topped with just the perfect amount of melted cheese and sweet tomato sauce, then this dish is for you!  Friday Bass Fish Special - Cooked to perfection, this Bass fish had everyone in our group oooing and awwwing for more. Served with a side of tomato penne and steamed vegetables, this is definitely one of the healthiest options, a must try!  Squid Appetizer - delicate squid slices covered in a fine tomato sauce, a great way to start off an authentic Italian dining experience!  I was completely surprised Abruzzo was not busy as it was a Friday night at around 7pm when we arrived.   You have to try Abruzzo, its that good! Check it out!!!"}
{"text":"One of the only places I take my clients for dinner. The chef is gracious and the food always tastes fresh, not to mention delicious and authentic. From the hostess to the servers we always feel taken care of. Truly, a pride of ownership that resonates in the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to check this place out for lunch today!  Just a tiny little restaurant on the corner of 8th street and 4th ave it is not hard to miss however the first thing that was a downer about this place is the parking lot. It is really tiny and if the parking lot is full you have to some how figure out how to reverse onto traffic lol.  We had a huge group of about 24-30 people (it was a celebration for a complete project at work). This is the best time to see how well a service can be when a group is this large.  They did a fantastic job in making sure everyone had beverages and although the food took a little longer to get out (with so many of us there together) they did as best of a job as they could and I cannot fault them for that.  Bruschetta to start followed by a nice hand made bun pre-cut and ready for the butter. Delicious!  I ordered the Pollo Parmiagano (spelling fail) which came covered in a nice rich tomato sauce. I thought the overall dish was good but I think I have had better at many other restaurants but please note it didn't suck it just wasn't as great as I have had before.  I finished off my meal with a Tiramisu which I thought was tasty and satisfying!"}
{"text":"Came here for a special occasion. Had always wanted to check this cozy looking place out. Started the meal with staciatella, and caprese salad. Both were a good forecast of what was to come. My husband ordered the veal napolitana as his main, and I got the chkn parmigiana. The serving sizes were quite generous in portion, leaving leftovers for me to take home. Concluded a perfect meal with Tiramisu and felt so content with the overall experience that I wanted to go around high-fiving everyone that worked there afterwards. Of course I did not because it was a relatively classy establishment, but the thought did cross my mind. Service was superb and this is the kind of place you definitely want to go to for a special occasion, and not to mention, the real Italian deal."}
{"text":"I've been going for 26 years and the recent changes to the menu are very good. Try the risotto dishes or the new seafood ravioli dish superb. I think that the price rating should be $$$ not $$"}
{"text":"Abruzzo Ristorante has been in Calgary for a long, long time and it's still going strong.  It's still in that same location, a little tiny house with white stuccoed walls and arched doorways.  There is a patio on the side of the restaurant and it's shady during the afternoon.    The food is still phenomenal after all this time.  I went with a group of people and we had the following:  Appys - Scampi, Shrimp and Cold cuts with mozarella and olives (Very, very good!)  Starter - Clam Chowder Soup (interesting take on the soup - they add minced carrots and there were lots of clam meat - soup's not too fishy and it was warm for a cold rainy day.)  Entree - Veal Saltibucco - veal topped with sage and prosciutto ham - a little salty but tastes really good, comes with penne in tomato sauce with parmesan cheese  Dessert - Pear - it's not a pear, really, but halzenut chocolate icecream shaped as a pear and dipped in chocolate, served with whipped cream - Yummers!!    Would I come back?  Defiinitely!!"}
{"text":"On the corner of 8th St and 4th Ave stands a little white house with a sign out front that says \"Abruzzo Ristorante.\" I've passed it many a time heading down to the river, but hadn't had occasion to stop in until recently.  The interior is small, right down to the front foyer. There's a coat closet to the left, the washrooms directly in front of you and the rest of the restaurant to the right. I hadn't looked at the menu online before going, but I didn't think this was the kind of place you'd find a cheap Tuesday pasta night. I like it when I'm right.  The menu has a variety of appys, pastas, veal and chicken entrees (you can see the full menu on their website). I decided on the minestrone soup and spaghetti matriciana. Before any soups and salads arrived at the table, we were presented with some complimentary bruschetta. Every guest is given a complimentary piece, made fresh and by hand right before it is served. Bruschetta is one of my most favourite appys when done right. This was done right. We were also given a basket of warm buns and butter to snack on.  The minestrone soup was vibrant with colour and veggies. The veggies themselves weren't overcooked and maintained a bit of crunch to them. What I enjoyed most about the spaghetti was that it came with smoked bacon on top and the portion was plentiful. I managed to eat about half of it.   They've got a decent selection on their wine list and a variety of choices available to make some of your basics from the bar.   Service was wonderful. Our server was pleasant, conversational and attentive. The restaurant maintained an intimate atmosphere, with tables set up throughout a couple of different rooms, soft lighting and candles on each, and Italian-esque music playing softly in the background. If atmosphere is what you're after, Abruzzo's definitely got that down.  The restaurant was also mostly an older crowd, I'd say more in the 40-60 range.   A must eat is the white chocolate gelato. It came encased in a hard white chocolate shell with a little raspberry coulee (or something similar) filling. I had declined dessert at first, but one of my dinner mates ordered the gelato, and the server brought extra spoons. One little bite of it simply wasn't enough. It gets five stars.  After all of this, why have I given Abruzzo three stars? It goes back to the food. I don't think the quality of the food matches the rest of the restaurant. Don't get me wrong, the food is good, it's just not as good as one would expect after walking through the front door. In particular, my noodles were too soft. There's a fine mark to getting al dente just right. Abruzzo missed it."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and was apprehensive. Glad I got past that. Food was very good and the service was great. Mario did a great job of taking cues of when to approach the table and move us to the next stage (or bottle). One thing I agree with, the music is so bad it is almost funny. Go enjoy some great Italian food, wine and some bad 80s music."}
{"text":"We dropped-in to Abruzzo just passing by, first time in Calgary, looking for some Latin flavor (even with Roman accent :-)) and were very happy with our decision.  The place is unmistakably Latin, even the paper napkins' holders were the same stainless steel boxes we've got so accustomed to back home in Argentina!  And those squeaky tables, intimate (not to use the word \"crumpled\") ambient where you are inevitably touching elbows with your neighbour... Totally non-American, I know, but not bad at all - at least to my taste.  Food was good. Pricey, yes - and the size of portions was just a tad bit less than I would have expected. But it was cooked right and served with great deal of personal attention.  Abruzzo adds to the positive memories about Calgary and I can only encourage both local people and visitors to check this place out. Just be prepared to pay a bit more for a bit less in quantity - but expect a very decent quality in return."}
{"text":"The food and ambiance is perfect for any occasion. The seafood and pasta were highlights of our dinner service and the risotto balls are a must try! Best tiramisu ever!"}
{"text":"So, a fourth time, being a sucker for punishment, decided to try again for take out. Excuse this time \"we have a party and won't do it\". Abruzzo, if you want to stay a dine in restaurant that is great, but stop misrepresenting that you do takeout on Just Eat. You can't advertise and then pick and choose at a whim when you do feel like doing it.q"}
{"text":"This restaurant was very good!!.. The service was super friendly and the wine was delicious!!.. All the pastas we ordered were great and the portions were huge!!.. No one in my table could eat their whole dish!... I definitely recommend this place!!.. There was absolutely nothing to complain!!"}
{"text":"So my co-worker and I had to take a trip to Calgary.  We asked the hotel we were staying at to reccomend a good Italian restaraunt.  This little hidden gem was very very good.  From the fresh bruchetta to the amazing veal that I had it was all very good.  We even had to ask for the chef just to thank him on the amazing meal.  This is one of Calgarys best hidden gems.  I was quite suprised there was not a review on this place.  You will not be disappointed."}
