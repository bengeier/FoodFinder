{"text":"Love the setting - intimate and cozy but casual and elegant at the same time. They really put a lot of love into their food!  I wish they changed their dishes more often because after going there more than 10 times, the menu is getting too familiar!"}
{"text":"Brunch:  If you don't get the side potatoe, you'll have food regret.   Dinner:  The Toro Sashi is unbeatable."}
{"text":"Love love love this little cafe/restaurant!!! We went to OEB one morning for breakfast and didn't want to wait for 3 hours for a table so we drove up the road and found this gem!   The eggs benedict (pork belly) was fantastic and had picture perfect presentation. I had the vegetarian curry with egg and it was most delightful because the curry flavor didnt overpower the whole dish and the baked cheese gave a good wholesome bite. The food is very clean and not greasy like most breakfast places in Calgary. The ambiance is calm and we sat by a window overlooking the garden while we enjoyed our food. The Guatemalan coffee theyre serving now is tasty (much better than the overrated Phil & Sebastian). Everything about the experience was delightful. This is our new go-to breakfast place!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee shop in Calgary.  The new owners are kind and happy to help.  Great coffee and baked goods and the lunch (panini's) are awesome!  The atmosphere is relaxing easy to work in."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in a stand-alone house with very nice ambience. I visited the restaurant by chance as another place my wife and I were planning on going on the same street had lines out the door but if it's not for that I would not have discovered this little gem! My wife had been here a couple times for lunch but this was my first. I ordered the lunch special- Foie Gras Don- first time I've seen the this 'fusion' and I was very impressed. My wife had the pork doria and it was also excellent. We will definitely return in the near future to try their dinner menus."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place one morning while taking a walk up the stairs. Was pleasantly surprised by the quality and variety of options available for brunch. The concept of typical brunch dishes like a egss benny combined with japanese tapas like pork belly was unique. Mimosas were up to the mark as well with fresh orange juice! The atmosphere deserves a special mention as well - nice retro house with a small cosy backyard which also serves as the outdoor patio seating.  All of this at extremely reasonable prices! Great stuff!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place I love. Intimate, casual, and run by owners with an obvious passion for food. The service is warm and attentive and the food is creative and delicious.   I came here for brunch and had the smoked salmon Benny with a home made bun and a citrus yuzu hollandaise. It was topped off by fried capers and some fish roe.  The flavors were spot on, egg was perfectly cooked... Wow.   The restaurant is in an old house and filled with eclectic furniture and cute decorations. Great spot for a date or an afternoon of casual studying.   The desserts are also all hand made with interesting Japanese twists."}
{"text":"Fabulous coffee and food for reasonable prices. The carrot cake is to die for! They have beer on tap - Pilsner Urquell, and serve various other drinks too. There is a variety of seating both inside and either on the front or back patios. Free wifi."}
{"text":"Tried this place for brunch for the first time today. Ordered the Sukiyaki Beef eggs Benedict and then got to try my friend's pork belly eggs Benedict. Both were delicious and not too heavy with a hint of sweetness to complement the eggs and meat. There's also free parking in the back and service was good."}
{"text":"We only had a coffee and a carrot cake so not much of their menu to be able to give a full 5 stars but what we had was great! My husband is the biggest carrot cake fan and said it was the best he ever had so it must've awesome!!  Will be back! Yum!"}
{"text":"I had a late lunch and wanted something light for dinner. They didn't bat an eye lid when I told them I wanted just a single tapa. It was beef shanks and it was delicious and reasonably priced. The staff there are enthisuastic and damn cute."}
{"text":"It was my first time to the cafe. I was hoping to sample their izikaya, but I was too early. I settled for their brunch menu. I ordered their eggs Benny with pork belly.  It was delicious. Their special hollandaise sauce was great. I can hardly wait to sample their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Great breakfast!!! Eggs Benedict...so delicious. No problem with getting in as it's a hidden gem. Way better food then the busy diner a few blocks down. Their coffees are great!"}
{"text":"I went here on a date over a year ago. I was a big fan of it's former incarnation - Garden's Grace. Cerezo Cafe and Bar was fine. We had cake, coffee and tea - all fine, no complaints, but not outstanding - easily forgotten. The service was fine, the ambience - okay. This location and building has great character that they could better make use of. Living in the shadow of a great cafe like Garden's Grace can not be easy. I wish them well."}
{"text":"The food always amazes me and the service is top notch. Offers brunch like eggs benny and banana bread French toast. Pictures speak for themselves. Everything's made in house and the prices are very reasonable (I would say they're underpriced but shhh). When you're driving on Edmonton trail you might miss it, as it's just a house at the corner of 9ave ne. It's definitely a gem in Calgary. I'll be coming here more often to try out everything on the menu."}
{"text":"I went back again!  My buddy and I tried to hit up OEBs down the road. It's still a place on my list, but I'm going to need a lot of luck to squeeze in a table.   We decided to walk a block to enjoy our bunch at Cerezo. I secretly want this place to stay hidden, but this cafe deserves attention. They honestly serve the most unique and delicious bunch/lunch I've had in Calgary.   The ladies make solid lattes too. I love their Spanish and Chai Lattes.   Last time I had their Pork Miso Cutlet Doria, which is nice combination of savoury and sweet. I went with their Bolognese Sirloin Burger (I know, the combo caught me off guard too), and the cook wowed my palette again.  Domo Arigato!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Cerezo. The atmosphere is quite relaxing and the food was delicious. I highly recommend the Doria - creamy goodness of rice baked with cheese on top with a refreshing miso sesame salad. We finished the day with a blueberry parfait which was delightful and light tasting."}
{"text":"I would give Cerezo 3.5 if I could but it's not a 4. Service was great; dessert was beyond amazing. We had the black sesame and green tea mouse cake, it was so good. However, I find most of the food items here are way way too salty. The toro sashi was good if you only have 2 pieces but it will start to get really salty after the second piece because of the sea salt they aged it with. The short ribs was ridiculously salty, I had one bite and could not eat anymore. Chicken karage was good but again, it gets salty after the 2nd piece. Only two things I like here is the dessert and the wagyu beef shank, that was deliciously tender. We also had the grilled squid stuffed with rice, again all I pretty much taste is the salt. I must say I was pretty disappointed. I would only come back here for dessert only, no food thank you."}
{"text":"Love having brunch at this unique house and follow with a beautiful plated dessert!!!   Yum"}
{"text":"Their sign says \"Best Egg Benny\" and they may be right.  The dishes taste as good as they look!  The kitchen took a bit longer than average but certainly worth the wait (and the service was attentive).  Definitely worth coming back again and again.  Eggs Benedict with braised pork belly...5 stars.  Simply perfect. Just a beautifully arranged dish.  The eggs are poached to perfection...as you cut through the white, the yolk just slowly oozes out.  The pork belly is nice and tender and kicks the dish up a notch.  The side of tomato and vegetable soup is tiny but loaded with flavor...the broth coats your spoon like a sauce!  Vegetable Frittata...4 stars.  Very good! Loved the cherry tomatoes.  Not as much seasoning as I'd like but that only means you can taste all the different vegetables.  The accompanying buttered toast were huge but tasty.  The strawberry preserve was also a delight."}
{"text":"I love this place. I almost don't want to write this review because I want to keep this place all to myself if I can help it but they truly deserve the praise.  Amazing food, prompt and super friendly service, and the place is nicely set up so noise isn't an issue. A place where you can actually have a good conversation while you dine!  My boyfriend had the braised pork belly Benedict and it was amazing. I had the gyu-suji beef curry rice don and it was very good. I don't know what they do differently to their scrambled eggs but I honestly have never had anything like it. How can scrambled eggs be surreal?!   I can't wait to go back; the happy hour looks great and the staff certainly make you feel appreciated. Something you don't normally experience on the hipster strip"}
{"text":"Tried the sukiyaki beef and pork belly Benny.  Both were phenomenal. The potatoes that come with it are very tasty as well. I know toast is toast but seriously best toast I ever had. The bread was fantastic and the jam they served with it was very good. Please check this place out . Very cute restraunt in an old house. They also make a very good london fog as well."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, interesting fusion of Japanese flavours and North American breakfast-style foods. Portion sizes are smaller than your typical North American fare, but perfect for sharing or for smaller appetites."}
{"text":"The Pork Belly Eggs Benedict are the best. I need not say more."}
{"text":"It was a wonderful experience dining here on a Tuesday night. It was really quiet, the food was pretty good. The squid with rice was really the highlight of all the dishes. The warm sake was also pretty good.  Expect to be here all night! It took a long time to have all the dishes ready."}
{"text":"I love finding new places to eat especially ones that I've never heard of. After a late night out Stampeding, our group of five wanted brunch. Someone picked OEB, which would have been great, minus the fact that it was a 3 hour wait time. Yes, you read that correctly. Three freaking hours. Pass! Even Diner Deluxe a few steps down was packed with an hour wait to boot. Too many brunchers. Luckily, someone suggested Cerezo which was just back up the street and ta da - no line!  Cerezo looks like someone's house from the outside. When you walk in, it oozes of comfort, family and relaxation. Apparently, they have a patio which I plan on taking full advantage of next time. Japanese tapas for dinner sounds quite appealing.   Brunch menu has some interesting options. What else would expect from a Japanese restaurant?  - Wholewheat & quinoa waffle ($10.95) - blueberry compote, maple syrup and vanilla whipped cream. Decadent would be the perfect way to describe these waffles. And \"healthy\", if you ignore the whipped cream added on top. The fresh fruit (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and cherries) were incredibly fresh while the waffles were light and fluffy. I also ordered a side of bacon ($3.00) but the waffles surprisingly satisfied my appetite. If you like sweet over savoury, get these! - Miso pork cutlet doria with salad ($16.95) - breaded pork cutlet with miso sauce, scrambled egg and brown rice with mornay sauce. The doria was absolutely enormous. I kid you not, this picture doesn't even do it justice. It easily could have been a meal for dinner and more - my buddy had to pack half of it for home. A Japanese style lasagna but filled instead with cheese, rice, egg, and fried pork cutlet, it's essentially a mini heart attack. All before it's even noon time. Again, I don't know how these flavours managed to work but it just did. The only criticsm we had was that the dish was a bit on the salty side - personally, I wouldn't have wanted to eat this all by myself. - Vegetable frittata with toast ($11.95) - our other friend ordered the frittata which came with a side salad and a couple pieces of toast. A nice oozy portion of cheese on top. It looked pretty good from my end. - Eggs sunny side ($12.00) - two sunny side eggs, bacon, toast and choice of salad, soup or caramelized potatoes. Apparently, Cerezo's potatoes are bomb so our friend with that. He was a bit disappointed with his order as it didn't have the glitz and glamour that the rest of our dishes had. His was simple but still well executed. - Housemade granola & Greek yogurt ($6.00) - look how gorgeous that granola and yogurt parfait looks. Beautifully presented and such attention to detail. Oh yeah, she devoured all of it too.  Overall, cozy spot to grab brunch with a Japanese twist. I'll have to come back to try their tapas menu for dinner. If it's anything like our first trip, we will be happy campers. Forget about waiting in line at other places nearby - Cerezo is worth it with their great food and care that they take in the little things that matter."}
{"text":"All right folks, here's my update, as promised. Last Friday, I went with nine other friends from my Japanese class. We ordered a bunch of tapas and just relaxed.  The food was absolutely fabulous! We shared the following: Miso Cheese Tofu Puff: Not squishy, nor too firm. Just right. Delicate flavours dance on your taste buds. Chicken Karaage: A different presentation from what I'm used to. Tender, sweet, but not overly so. Thin Sliced Soy Sauce Braised Pork: Like bacon but with a little twist. Oishii!  Miso-Katsu: Light cheese that complemented the tangy sauce underneath. So good, we ordered a second dish!  Salmon Gravlax: Nice. Very nice. The cream cheese had herbs but nothing like what you get at the supermarket. Delish! Negi Miso Beef: Very tender and flavourful. The daikon radish garnish was refreshing. Nasu: The grilled eggplant was lovely.  There was one more dish, but my memory escapes me. The portions were just right for sharing.  We all left room for dessert, which was comprised of: Strawberry Shortcake: Japanese strawberry shortcake is like a well balanced string quartet.  Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake: Light, fluffy and with some added surprises. This prompted the Oishii Oishii dance by yours truly. Yogurt Cheesecake: Also light and fluffy. Not too sweet. Chocolate Cake: Dark, rich but again, not too sweet. Sakura Parfait: Sakura ice cream is very delicious.  The staff were extremely courteous. They had warned us beforehand that they would be busy (Translation: do not be in a rush because your food won't get there any faster).   Having said that, this is where Cerezo loses one star. It was indeed busy on Friday night. It didn't help that they had several larger groups, between 6 - 10 people. One server. It didn't help that the server would run down to the kitchen after taking one person's order (as opposed to taking down each person's order in the party and then taking it all down to the kitchen).  In short, Cerezo shines most brightly with smaller groups. It is definitely more fun to go in a group. Just be prepared to sit and relax. Have a great visit. The food will be worth the wait.

{"text":"I've been to this place a few times when it was Gardens' Grace Boutique and Coffee Bar.  Really liked it back then as it was very quaint, they sold gift items as well as food, coffee and tea.  I loved browsing around...there was so much character in the place.  I had not stopped in for coffee in awhile and while driving by about a month ago I noticed the name had changed to Cerezo Cafe & Bar.  I tried googling and couldn't find much on it or what happened to Garden's Grace.  Today I was finally able to stop in and check the place out.  While Garden's Grace had so much character inside Cerezo's sadly does not.  It's very plain and I did not get the warm fuzzy friendly feeling I had before.  The lady working there was lovely and she made me a good coffee but in the end there was nothing else there to entice me back.   I couldn't help but wander around while I was waiting for the coffee hoping I would find something interesting to look at (but no).  They do offer some food items as well as a nice offering of coffee/tea selections and I suspect they might have WIFI as there was one person inside sitting at a table with a laptop.  Sadly however I do not feel the urge to go running back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Cerezo for a long time.  The restaurant is in an older house on Edmonton Trail so it gives it this laid back vibe. They make really great coffees (spanish latte is my favourite) and the food and desserts are always very good. They have really delicious brunch as well; I tried the curry dish with rice. It is a small restaurant so it does tend to take a bit longer to get the food. If you have the time; this place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I've noticed in Calgary there is a very distinct line in available dining options. On one side there's the bigger box/chain restaurants where the crowd goes to see or be seen and on the other side is the small mom and pop shops which cater to everyone else. Cerezo is part of the latter, providing a refreshing alternative to run of the mill Calgary restaurants.  Whether it's brunch, lunch, dinner or dessert, Cerezo offers an innovative menu unlike anything else in Calgary. For example, brunch staples like eggs benny are reimagined with a Japanese touch by infusing the hollandaise with yuzu. Tuna tataki is served with a  soy/truffle mixture and presented like a painting. And the desserts?  They look like fairyland anime landscapes almost too pretty to eat. For me, I enjoy the change from the typical that Cerezo offers. It reminds me of the creative food scene typical of Montreal,  Vancouver, Toronto,  Hong Kong and worldwide. I can see its not for everyone - especially not those looking for hip cocktails, normal food and what's 'cool' but if you're interested in charm, creative delicious food creations and friendly service, go here now.   Take it from me as I sit here drinking a mimosa and nibbling on my matcha green tea creme brulee."}
{"text":"Came here for an impromptu lunch as the restaurant we had originally planned to go to was closed. The environment was casual and intimate with many cute decorations. I ordered their baked egg with vegetables, curry and cheese which came with a side of bread and soup of the day. The entrée was well balanced and not too spicy. Their carrot soup was smooth and seasoned perfectly; one of the best I've had in the city.     It was a wonderful experience dining here for brunch. Their décor and unique take on brunch will bring me back time and time again. In the coming days, I look forward to giving their tapas and desserts a try as well."}
{"text":"Suprising good japanese tapas restaurant.   We went there for both breakfast and dinner."}
{"text":"Well isn't this just the cat's meow, or the mouse's squeak? Cerezo used to be another coffee/tea house kind of a thing that I always kept meaning to stop at but never did. And then it became Cerezo... a place I've been meaning to stop at and finally did!  It's an old house turned cafe with tables and chairs that are different from one another, a variety of cakes and goodies to eat, coffees, teas and drink and a fiendishly good lemon pistachio biscotti to dunk. What makes it different from other cute coffee spaces? It also serves Japanese tapas. Go figure! We didn't stop in for any of those, but the strawberry short cake my friend ordered was all dressed up on the spot, with little syrup hearts on the side and everything.  Free wifi too! Just ask for the password at the counter.  Tip: The table under the window on the north wall is a little rickety.. Cerezo knows this and put my Americano on the window sill instead when they brought it over to me."}
{"text":"My eldest sister was visiting from Winnipeg and of course I dragged her to my gym to meet my crew and get a workout in.  We had a semi plan...after the gym we'll head out somewhere to eat but we had no idea where.  \"I don't care, just surprise me!!\" Nat says.  I really had no idea where to take her, until I remembered that I have tons of places bookmarked on my handy dandy yelp app! So there I go and scan through my bookmarked restaurants.  CEREZO.  Yup, that's where we're going, I've been wanting to try this place out for a while AND it's even on the way!! Even better.  I quickly punched in the address in google maps and we were on the way.  I turn the corner and park...google maps says we're here but I can't spot Cerezo!!  Turns out, it was RIGHT THERE but I just missed it.    Cerezo is located on Edmonton Trail, just a few blocks from Boogie burger.  It's a cute little house on the corner so if you're not aware, you'll miss it like I did.  Street parking is available.  When we entered, you can tell that the living area has been turned into a dining area, quite small but super cozy.  We were seated at a two person table and immediately greeted and handed the menus.  Natalie went with a glass of beer and I went with the mango float.  Most of the menu items are tapa style but of course entrees are entrees.  We decided share and ordered two specials that night - Duck breast which came with linguine and japanese yuzu sauce, Nasu-sticks which was eggplant fritters with mascarpone dashi dip and homemade spicy mayo as well as the soy sauce braised pork belly.  My sister and I had a lot to talk about but we noticed that the food did take a while to come, but once it came..boy was it worth the wait.  The presentation for all the dishes is just impeccable - almost too pretty to eat!   The eggplant fritters were amazing, they were piled on one another, topped with parmesan cheese slivers, arugula and a side of stacked celery and carrot sticks. The eggplant was lightly battered and deep fried, they had a wonderful crisp and then when you bite into them the water from the eggplant soaked in your mouth. Delicious.  The dips were house made and super tasty. Mascarpone dip was tangy and slightly sweet and the spicy mayo was also tangy with a hint of spice.  The soy sauce braised pork belly was phenomenal.  They were very thinly sliced and literally MELT IN YOUR MOUTH just as pork belly should be.  Similar to bacon but 10x better, you've got to taste for yourself to believe me..melt. in. your. mouth.  Lastly, the duck breast was beautifully sliced with a tasty side of linguine.  The Japanese yuzu sauce made everything come together, it was soaked in the linguine and over the duck breast.  The duck breast was smooth and tender while the linguine was perfectly al dente with some assorted vegetables mixed in.  Everything was absolutely wonderful, we didn't want our taste buds to rest so we decided to share a lemon tart :)  Of course when the lemon tart arrived, it's just a work of art.  The crust was soft yet crispy, lemon was nice and sweet and the meringue was airy and delicious..a perfect combination.  I got so excited about the food, I didn't really talk about the service.  Our cute waitresses explained the dishes as they came, checked on us to ensure everything was good but didn't come by often enough to top up our water.  Also, I had wished that there was more lighting, the area we got seated was quite dark which made for OK photos ;)  The food at Cerezo is made carefully and clearly with love.  I think Cerezo is a perfect place to bring your significant other on any special occasion or just because OR if you wanted to impress your date, Cerezo is the place to impress them at!  The atmosphere is very imitate!  Please visit Cerezo for an unreal dining experience!  Your taste buds will thank you."}
{"text":"Who knew that waffles made with whole wheat and quinoa could be so light, fluffy, yummy, good! This out of the way, kinda middle of nowhere spot is an absolute treasure! It's a cafe by day with odd but comfy seating (definitely a great spot to bang on the laptop for an hour or two), it has a limited menu but I am assured by Wendy P, it is all excellent. Oh and apparently in the evening it turns into a Japanese Tapas restaurant?! I'm not sure how Spanish tapas mesh with Japanese food... but I've seen odder culinary mash ups and fusions; I think?!   So if you are bored of you usual coffee shop give this place a whirl. I think you'll love it! Oh, and back to those waffles, delicious! The blueberry compote, maple syrup drizzle, decadent whipped cream... It was this waffle-lover's shocking breakfast surprise of the month!"}
{"text":"It seems to be a very unique Japanese cafe.   The pork belly eggs Benny was one of the best I had tried! Love the yuzu hollandaise sauce. Also the caramelized potato was amazing!!!   The wholewheat and quinoa waffle was much better than expected too.. I always thought wholewheat means dry and bland but it's not like this here!  Dessert was good too! We had the double chocolate with framboise mouse! Looked and tasted very good.  I would love to come back again and again!!"}
{"text":"We have found a new breakfast spot.  For some strange reason Edmonton Trail has become something of a breakfast/brunch zone.  Cerezo, although on the northern end of this hotspot is one of the bright ones keeping this area hot like fire.  Cerezo is an old house converted into a restaurant.  It's quaint and surprisingly spacious for the period.  In the summer they have a sizable backyard area where you can eat outside.  The food was an interesting blend of Japanese ingredients and western styles.  The potatoes are the best and rival any breakfast place on the planet that I've tried.  The eggs benedict was excellent.  Also, their selections of coffees and teas were vast.  I can't remember the last time I've had a London Fog that good.  The only thing I'd suggest is to get a bit of a better ventilation system in there.  Being an older structure the air gets a bit thick."}
{"text":"This is not a sushi place.. I went there on a Sunday and I  had a few drinks which were ok... The salad was not bad... But definitely not a place I would go back.. I was a little disappointed as the place looks like those little restaurants that are not fancy, but normally are pretty good on food... This is not the case..."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place isn't more popular because it is a lot better than some of the japanese places in calgary. The location is not far from downtown and the house restaurant vibe is great. I would say the dinner has better options than the lunch but both meals I've had were very satisfying. For dinner, try going with some friends so you can share their tapas. There are a lot of good choices and you don't want to miss out on them. I recommend the pork belly, their sashimi (one of the places with fresher good fish - this is hard to find in calgary sometimes), and basa. If you are ever craving japanese desserts (which is almost daily for me), then cerezo is the place to go. They have black sesame, matcha and hojicha inspired desserts and our group ordered every dessert on the menu. I would come back here to have desserts! Definitely give this place a try because you don't often find places like this in the city's core."}
{"text":"Great little place. The atmosphere here is a bit different. You can stand at the till to order as many customers seem to like to take food out. As well you can sit in their quaint, very clean, spacious and nicely put together. The restaurant is an old house that has been turned into a dining place. The meals are great and the desserts are amazing as well. The staff is very friendly and the owners are very much involved in the operation. I would like to see organic offered as few places do offer it and then I would be more likely to give up a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Tapas style Japanese cuisine. Variety to choose from the menu from tofu with miso cheese to fois gras with rice and nori. Food is flavorful and comes in good portions so ideal to share with a group.  Service is very attentive."}
{"text":"Awesome little place.  The food is delicious and surprising.  I've certainly never been anywhere else that had a bolognese burger with miso or a foiegras Don.  Coffee is pretty good too,  I'd highly recommend trying it out."}
