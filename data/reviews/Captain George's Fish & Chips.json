Regardless of how much we loved our lunch, your employee and how he treats people is where you'll find the restaurant's real treasure."}
{"text":"Fish portions where way to small and fish was not very fresh. Would not visit this place again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Extremely clean and nice environment. The food was delicious fluffy and fresh. House tartar sauce was incredible. I can't wait come back. Strongly recommended to all."}
{"text":"I've been hearing from several local friends in the Richmond Hill (Oak Ridges) and Aurora area that this place recently changed owners and it was simply a divine spot for some \"Ish and Chips\" (no spelling error).

Working in the Aurora area on Friday I decided I would pay them a visit to see what all the noise was about. Located in the plaza behind the TD Canada Trust at the corner of Yonge and Wellington, it's a deceivingly large spot inside given its tiny store front. 

Inside the spot is cute, a typical little chippy with lots of sea inspired colours and decor. Upon walking in I was warmly greeted by the family that runs the place (I'm always a sucker for a spot when families are working together to make a life for themselves).

To summarize the food I would describe it as: Quick, cheap, and cooked well.
The fries were fantastic! Fresh cut and thick, you know the kind that can absorb an crap load of malt vinegar and salt and still find a way to be crispy? Ya those kind. Meanwhile the Halibut filet was lightly battered (different from most other Halibut filets I'd encountered) but tasted great. My main complaint was that the filets size was very small However, for $7.10 for the single piece Fish& Chips special I guess I can't really complain. 

This was going to be a 3 star as in my opinion it was an A-OK mean, nothing fancy but nothing bad. That was until I was paying and the owners told me how they use a healthier, simpler batter which is less heavy and I appreciate that they're attempting to make fish and chips a little healthier for you and me. 3.5 star for me (rounded up).

Hot tip: AYCE haddock fish and chips every Monday Tuesday Wednesday and Saturday for $9.99!
Seniors get 10% off on Tuesdays.

{"text":"Very nice couple runs this place. It is clean and the food is reasonable and priced fairly. I think this is the best place in town for fish and chips. I personally enjoy the shrimp and chips."}
{"text":"Great service and great food!

As a young veteran when it comes to fish and chips, Ive developed a tried-and-true strategy when it comes to evaluating fish and chip locales. That is, simply stated, not having the fish and chips! Based on experience, I can say with confidence that most fish and chips end up tasting unmemorable and simply much like the next one down the street. So, by trying out the other items offered on the menu other than the fish, one can come to the decision as to which restaurant is better than the other. The banquet burger is delectable and quite memorable, with thick cut bacon, tangy cheese and a generous portion of thick cut fries. Though the establishment is small, it never feels cramped, even when many of the tables are taken up. I remember I came in on quiet afternoon and had no intention of eating at the location. However,   the friendliness of the staff and charm of the restaurant persuaded me to stay, without which I may have never of gotten the chance to enjoy its great service! If your looking for a good time AND a good meal, this restaurant is the one for you!"}
{"text":"passing by along Dundas St from the Oshawa Civic Stadium, we wanted to try something local, hence we stumbled upon this fish and chips joint.
The decor, bright, and fresh look of the restaurant was the first noticable thing.
The server was extrememly polite, and helpful since we were asking for some recommendations.
The food was a 4.5/5.
I was happy to see that my fish and chips were not DRENCHED in oil like im used to seeing. lol.
Their Fish and Batter was perfectly prepared.  Especially the batter! which was not too thick.

Overall the place is great, the prices are very reasonable.  My special which included one fish (Haddock or Cod) with fries, pop, and coleslaw was $10."}
{"text":"I've been going here for a few years (usually Friday lunch treat).  I hadn't the opportunity to visit in a year so I was surprised that the business had been sold.

Under the old management this place was a 5 STAR.  The fish so flaky and tender, the batter delicious, the fries fresh and the service great.  You could choose between halibut and cod (I usually chose the halibut).   It's a takeout place as well as a sit down restaurant.  Nothing fancy, but it does the job.

Under the new management, sorry I'm just not feeling it.  The fish was too oily.  Wasn't impressed.  Also, the new takeout containers are so tiny and flimsy that by the time you get home everything is soggy and to be honest not worth eating.  Tres disappointing.

The only 2 STAR redeeming quality is the price - lots of options for meals under $10"}
{"text":"Recently tried this place. I found the halibut and chips cooked to my liking.
I've tried all fish and chip places in Aurora and this one comes out on top.
A couple of their competitors now either don't serve small portions for dinner, or the other one serves whitefish for their special, does not compare to halibut."}
{"text":"This Fish and Chips place right by Port Perry Marina is a total treat! After kayaking, my friend and I worked up quite an appetite and this was definitely the way to go.

It's got an overt nautical theme with its decked out blue decor and anchors. Bonus points for the clean interior and wide array of seating available. You can head to the counter and order what you will - I got the fried halibut. For all the healthier folk out there, you can get your fish grilled, so just let them know when you order.

Needless to say the food was fresh, clean, and delicious. Sometimes fish and chips can be a little on the heavier side which makes my stomach do the bad kind of backflips. However, this was perfect as it wasn't too oily. The chips are thicker than average and quite tasty. Slaw was also good with a crisp finish. Definitely get the House Tartar sauce on the side because that ish was incredible!"}
{"text":"This establishment just opened at 1910 Dundas Street East, Whiby, Ontario.

The fish is likely the best deep fried fish you can find in Ontario, Canada and the chips are fairly good at most locations.

Ordered the daily special with clam chowder and a Captain George's Fish & Chips Special entree.

The daily special was very good -- fish fingers; chips; and soup for approximately $9.  There was a choice between two soups of the day (clam chowder & cream of potato), and the wrong soup was served (no fault of the waitress).  They compensated for serving the wrong soup by providing the correct soup for free.

The Captain George's Fish & Chips Special entree came with fish; chips; shrimps; scallops; and, salad.  The salad was clean, as there was some water remaining on it and there was far too much salad dressing.  After finishing the salad there as a pool of water and dressing.  The scallops were not so great, nor were the shrimp.

This location just opened and perhaps the glitches with my meal can be attributed to inexperience.

The waitress was wonderful and definitely provided the best service she could possibly provide.  They asked me how the food was, so they sincerely care.  However, I don't like to be negative so I did not bother mentioning the minor issues that I encountered (after all, they knew they got the soup wrong).

As for the food ... the fish & chips were wonderful, but cannot say the same of their garden salad, shrimp, and scallops.

If you like fish & chips, this is the place to go... just avoid the fancier dishes, because they have not perfected them just yet (in my opinion)."}
