{"text":"They catered a company picnic for us and all the food was great. Lovely salad with lots of toppings, roasted veggies and chicken were delicious."}
{"text":"I have used Waterfall for both at home parties and work events.  In every case the food was incredible.  Start with home made potato chips that are a true art.  We have ordered chocolate covered strawberries, I have yet to taste one since they are gone within minutes.  And each entr√©e is flavorful and cooked to perfection.  The owners are hands on and work with you to meet the needs of your event.  I will only use Waterfall for my catering needs."}
{"text":"We used Waterfall Catering for a 70th birthday party for my dad yesterday.  We had about 75 people in attendance and I'm pretty certain that 90% of them asked for the name of the caterer because everyone really enjoyed the food!  A few guests raved about how delicious the London broil was, noting they have never had it cooked so perfectly.  The caprese skewers were also a big hit with several guests taking multiples.  There wasn't a single roasted seasonal vegetable left in the pan as that too left everyone very pleased!  The soft pretzels were a great add on.  Delivery and working with Renee was spot on, professional and friendly.  I highly recommend Waterfall Catering!  You won't be disappointed!"}
