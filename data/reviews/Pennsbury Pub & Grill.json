{"text":"This is our go-to place for good food and great sports viewing.  Not sure who previous reviewer is talking about but the owner is a man and he seems to be a decent guy.  Families are welcome, especially in the large dining room which also has a number of tv's including one at every booth ( kids watch cartoons while adults watch the game).   Bar area is great for watching multiple games with nice new hd tvs."}
{"text":"My mother in law rants and raves about this place, so during one of my trips to the Burgh, she took us there.    She was not kidding, those wings, oh my.  They were really crispy yet juicy and the fried pickles...some of the best fried pickles i've ever had.    the server was really nice and asked us if we wanted to be in the dining area or near the bar instead of assuming...nice job!  I am thinking about those wings right now, dang I wish i had some."}
{"text":"Service seemed quite good but the meatball sandwich I ordered seemed to be lacking enough meatballs at least one-forth of the bun was empty lengthwise and the meatballs were small. They should either put on more meatballs of adequate size or serve it on a bun half the size."}
{"text":"Always great food! Never had a bad meal! Can't go wrong with their wings. Excellent place to watch games and hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, solid cheeseburgers and chicken sandwiches. Great kettle chips served with mostly everything. Only problem is the service isn't always amazing. I've had a lot of big group dinners and the staff is very tolerant."}
{"text":"This a great little place to watch a game or catch up with a few friends without being drowned out by music or cigarette smoke. The drink specials are good but fairly typical of any neighborhood bar.  Standard bar food, but still good.  I'll continue to go until my friends move out of the surrounding complex."}
{"text":"We used to frequent the Pennsbury Pub back when it was Scores.  They have great beer specials  When we went there they had Molson drafts for 2.00 all day every day.  They also had pitcher specials.  Lots of flat screens.  There is a bar area and a dining room.  Wings are pretty good as are the fries or homemade chips.  Sandwiches are also pretty good.  Service has always been good as well.    This is just a nice laid back venue with friendly wait staff to make sure you have a good time.  Great place for a low key happy hour.  We will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh atmosphere, great prices, great appetizers, and solid pizza selections. Bring friends or a happy hour crew here. If you live in the Pennsbury Village community, it is an easy walk up the hill."}
{"text":"Went here for a late night drink. Prices are pretty cheap. Has a hole in the wall atmosphere. It was conveniently located in the neighborhood I was staying at. I went around 11 or 12 at night and the kitchen was closed at that time."}
{"text":"Wings are made to order! Crispy & juicy.  Small town bar feel! Very friendly staff & patrons.  Gray place to watch a game and throw back some drafts!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out one night for date night. Nice little hidden location within Pennsbury apartments. The parking can be really rough if you don't get there early. The food could have been a lot better, I got pasta and the sauce kinda ruined the dish. I will give them another try for sure though."}
{"text":"Good neighborhood bar. Have only been here for late night drinks, unfortunately never food [look for updates]. Good large space, ideal for groups of friends. Friendly bartenders who diligently shake their heads at you as you order another round of fireapple shots. Patio out will be ideal for afternoon lounging."}
{"text":"We've checked out this place three times because we really wanted to make it our neighborhood spot because we live really close, but it fell short all three times. The first time we went we waited 45 minutes to get a server's attention. It was during a Pens game so we made allowances but the food really wasn't very good.  Second time, the service was better but they don't have Bud Light on tap and we really don't like Coors or Miller and especially not Labatt. The bottles we ordered were warmish.  Third time we went we gave up and agreed on the way out that we gave it a good shot but the convenience is just not worth the food. If we go back it will only be to drink."}
{"text":"Came here on my first visit to Pittsburgh. Food was good, beer was cold, service was fast, people were nice. What more can you ask for? Tried gnocchi with pesto sauce and Italian wedding soup. Delicious! I'd definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Pennsbury pub and grille is a great spot for good drinks, excellent service, and awesome food. Friendly people and overall nice atmosphere. Grilled cheese is to die for and basically everything else on the menu! A+"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for dinner. Their grilled cheese is amazing and definitely worth a try. I love that you can choose chips, fries, or tater tots depending on your mood. I have never had anything here that I didn't like. Food is fresh and very delicious. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I ordered the \"build your own\" burger, fried pickles and wings. I ordered the burger medium rare but i think whoever cooked it, cooked it about 2 minutes too long then when they ran it under the broiler to melt the cheese it cooked the patty even more. So by the time I got it, it was medium well almost well done. It still had moisture though. As far as the rest of it goes, i thought it was perfect. The chips were perfectly cooked.       The fried pickles and wings were delicious. However, when they packed my order, they forgot to put blue cheese in. I ordered blue cheese and that shows on my receipt. So those minor details is why they got a 4 instead of a 5. I would order from here again though."}
{"text":"Nice place to grab a quick meal or watch a sporting event.  About 10 TV's in the bar area.  Had the soft taco special, that was good pub grub.  Service was very good and very friendly."}
{"text":"Living in Thornberry, we really wanted to make this our \"go to\" yet time and time again we are left disappointed. Most recently we ordered on GrubHub, they screwed the order up, told my husband I didn't order the right thing, then when I called told me to take it up with GrubHub.  I'm left asking myself why I continue to set myself up for disappointment. Food is alright -would probably taste better if it was what I ordered!"}
