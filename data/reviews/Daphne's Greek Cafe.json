{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, since it's close to where I live.  Really, I did.  Unfortunately, it's just  not good.  My hubby ordered the Gyros Plate, and I ordered a Gyro sandwich.  Because we were extra hungry, we also ordered calamari appetizer and feta fries.  Nothing was good.  I mean, how can feta fries not be good?  I think they must use very cheap ingredients.  The lamb flavor was not good, and the calamari was rubbery.  Tzatziki sauce not good either.  I've had way better Greek food in crummy indoor malls.  So disappointing.  I don't know if I'd go back if you gave me a free meal there.  It would have to be a long time from now, when my memory has faded of the un-tasty meal we had.  Blech.
Just told my hubby I was writing a review of Daphne's, and he said it wasn't worth it, \"it's nasty!\"  LOL."}
{"text":"As mainstream-americanized as this place comes off as, the Veggie platter and Gyro platter weren't bad.  I'll admit, I'm no real connoisseur of Mediterranean food, but Daphne's hit the spot and wasn't too harsh on the wallet."}
{"text":"This place looks like a typical American franchise and I was not expecting the food and service to be very good.  However, what I found was the exact opposite.  I went for lunch on a Sunday afternoon.  The place was mostly dead with only 3 or 4 other diners.  We were met at the counter by a very friendly hostess/cashier/server.  She gave us a rundown of the menu and a few specials they were offering.  We ordered the red pepper hummus, a Gyro salad, a spicy grilled chicken with fire feta salad, and a piece of baklava.  The prices were reasonable at everything cost about $20.  You can't beat their $1 specials which cover their soups, hummus and baklava selections.  We sat down and our hummus arrived almost immediately.  It was excellent.  Especially the pitas which were fluffy, hot and fresh.  Five minutes later our salads arrived and they were equally good.  The spicy chicken salad with fire feta was a bit weird (which is why I ordered it) but in a good way.  It was a very decent size and all the ingredients seemed to be fresh.  The salad had a kick to it so they weren't lying about the \"spicy\" or \"fire\" part.  The gyro salad was excellent.  I wish I had ordered that but wanted to try something different from my dining partner.  Next time I will definitely order it.  Anyway, the gyro was very fresh and had been cut just seconds before serving.  The salad was a decent size and very tasty.  For desert we shared a piece of baklava.  It was delicious and just a few bites cured my sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Just had to mention the pita burger I had the other day.  So good!  Really juicy beef with lettuce, tomato, your choice of fire feta/roasted pepper feta/regular all stuffed between two cute little mini pitas.  YUM!  The meal is a good deal, with fries for 5.99.  I had a coupon, 3.99.  You can subtitute salad for the fries... which I should have done.  

Here's the coupon, it expires tomorrow though... sorry!

{"text":"I enjoy falafels and my boyfriend really likes Gyros.  So, when we received a coupon for Daphne's Greek Caf√© we were jazzed to go check it out.

What I noticed right away is it has kind of a fast-food sort of feel to it and I thought, OK, its catering to people on their lunch breaks.  However, the food itself is like Greek fast food for people who have never had anywhere near really Greek food before and so they wouldn't know any better.

The plates are astatically pleasing with everything arranged nice and neat.  This amounted to zilch to me.  When I got to eat, I want plenty of food and I want quality as appropriately expected from the type of establishment I am eating at.  

At Daphne's you get a few little thin slices of what may or may not be real gyro meat.  The falafel meat is little over fried disks.  That's right disks.  Not balls of falafel meat where the outside is slightly crunchy and the inside is meaty and moist.  The pita bread is not.  It's just some flat bread cut into little triangles.  The tzatziki sauce is ... what the heck is this stuff in this little 1 inch paper cup?  The vegetables were fresh.

There is more to complain about with this place, but you get the picture.  I'm thinking that anyone who likes it here just doesn't know what real Greek food is like."}
{"text":"Went to eat at Daphnes last night with my girlfreind. The food was awesome and the employee's were very helpful. The manager recomended a dinner special. The special was a ton of food for cheap! Got eat!"}
{"text":"These far-reaching Gods of Cafetopolis you see, 

Whose minions such as Paneracles and Chipotle have erected from sea to sea,

Desired like the vendors beyond the Acropolis offerings,

Cafeteria dining serving Gyro and many such things,



The fare was befitting of above mentioned ilk,

Two stars at best though service was silk,

The dolomades came hard the hummus was tasty,

Spanakopita came fried as the cooks may be hasty,

Falafel were shaped as tater-tots would,

Pasty inside the two were not good,



Salad lacked olives but for a dollop all ground,

Feta was sparse with no pungency found,

Drachmas went quickly when food was just ordered,

Higher quality Greek food the price could have afforded


(English majors...was that iambic pentameter?)"}
{"text":"Daphne's isn't bad. If you're hungry, it's edible, decent, and maybe even good. But it's not a magical land of unicorns, rainbows, and perfect Mediterranean food.

The baklava hits the spot but tends to be over-syruped. If you can grab it while it's still fresh out of the oven, it's much better.

The gyros are decent, but alas, they ain't traditional lamb. They are instead the well-known \"log o' ground meat.\" Delicious pitas, but the best pita in the world doesn't replace proper sliced lamb.

The roast chicken, on the other hand, is delicious and I can find no faults with it.

And the olive tapenade is as disgusting as it is at \"real\" Greek joints, so they're at least doing that much right. Die, kalamata olives, die!"}
{"text":"We came here recently for lunch, and it just took too damn long. We didn't order anything wild, and the food was just ok. The appetizers came after the food, but the waitress tried to make up for it with a smile."}
