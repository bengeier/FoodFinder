{"text":"This hopping little gem on Avenue Road just north of Lawrence is the perfect spot to fill your hunger for wings and fun!  It's a wood tavern adorned with classic stained glass lamps, 2 tvs, 80's rock in the backround, and the perfect bartender. She has long blond hair, a raspy voice and knows how to treat her patrons both regulars and newbies.  This lady is awesome! She is filled with both good humor and wit. She was laughing and joking around even though she has been working here for 19 years! And I know why.... I have been going to this place for 10 years. Everytime it is perfectly \"Bistro on Avenue.\" We ordered the wings, of course! And a burger that was steamed as it's preparation. We were so curious as to what that meant. We sat back, enjoyed our pints of Keith's and the ambiance and waited. Despite the booming patio and full house inside our food arrived in perfect time. Everything was incredible. Truly the best wings in town! Dry rubbed wings served w/ perfectly cooked chunky fries and of course the famous creamy dill dipping sauce. The burger waaaas steamed! This was mind-blowing! A juicy, tender burger inlaced with spices that when cooked became gently aromatic. Luckily I managed to get in two quick bites before my friend inhaled this savory treat.   I highly recommend this place to any wing and burger lover around the globe! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"What can I say...  Staff are liars.    Three of us went in, ordered food and the fellas ordered a pitcher of beer.  Later, the server asked if they'd like a second pitcher, and the guys said, \"Yes.\"   We were enjoying ourselves, and the food was tasty enough.  The second pitcher to arrive was clearly not the kind they'd ordered (the colour was dramatically different), so the server took it back and brought the correct one.  The bill came, and we were charged - not even for three but - for FOUR pitchers.  We reminded the server that we'd only consumed two, but that one was brought in error.  Server went away, but came back insisting we pay for at least three (like they were doing us a favour by removing one of the two erroneously-charged pitchers).  When we tried to explain the server's error, we were directed to (the manager?).  He was acting as though he was too busy to even listen to us.  He abruptly told us to pay for just the two pitchers, but to never come back.    What can I say?  Gladly.  ...Just unprofessional liars.  I have never, ever, ever, had a SINGLE problem at a restaurant before or since.  Goodness.  I've never even sent a dish back.  We were respectful and earnestly tried to explain THE SERVER'S error...to no avail.  There were no raised voices on our part...just complete bewilderment.  We left embarrassed and dumbfounded.  What a shoddy way to do business.    This happened a little while ago, but I'm still so offended, I'm finally getting around to telling what happened to me.    This may never happen to you...if you're lucky.  (To be fair, in 50 years of eating at restaurants in a dozen countries, this restaurant is the only one to treat me so badly and unfairly.)  Every dime you spend there supports staff who will try to lie and cheat customers out of their money, and then slander them, publicly, when they don't acquiesce.    I'm thrilled to have never been back.  There are literally thousands of restaurants in Toronto from which to choose."}
{"text":"Your wings will come dry, and hard, and burned.  I love well done wings, but is the person in the kitchen playing a joke? Will NEVER go back.  GARBAGE"}
{"text":"My first visit to the new location was like losing an old friend. After being at the south Avenue road location for more than two decades, I really had no idea what to expect. Sadly, although the wings are as good as ever, the new location has no atmosphere, decorating out of the 70's that has no bearing on this being a neighbourhood pub. It's just horrible. It's also way to big. That the place was empty...I was the only one in the left hand section of the old Italian restaurant...is an indication that things may not work here."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. Back in the day these were the best wings in town. Went a week ago on a Saturday night. The place was empty. Went to order wings to go in the back. Let's just say the kitchen looked pretty sketchy. The wings were ready in like two minutes...so not fresh at all. The wings were ok not bad. No desire to go back."}
{"text":"They changed the fries. They use to be rippled. Maybe that's a St. Louis thing.   Fries are always amazing. The garlic, dill dip is my fav. :)"}
{"text":"Walked in asked for a high chair was told theres \"no high chairs or coloring books\" Food was good but took almost an hour to arrive. We have been going to the original location for 22 years and loved the cozy feel. The new location doesn't have the same vibe. Overall food is always good but disappointed that the take out counter was more important than us customers seated for dinner."}
{"text":"having heard that this was the original st.louis, and i love st. louis, i thought this place was going to be amazing.  i got the weekend special which came with wings, fries, jalepeno poppers and chicken strips.   I really like their wings, i tried cajun dust or something like that!  Everything else was cold, i'll probably get just wings if i'm ever in the neighbourhood. they had an heated patio (in the winter) which was cool for additional seating.  Ameretto sour tasted funky, nice wings, nice service but not worth the trip from west town just to try them. Personally, st. louis is 5x better"}
{"text":"Came to Bistro on Avenue for a late night snack. Our server was very nice. We ordered the BBQ wings and ribs. The wings were not saucy but dry and the ribs were normal, nothing special. I really enjoyed the fries tough.  Overall: Decent atmosphere and service but nothing special about the food."}
{"text":"Bistro is always on top! They have the best wings in the city hands down! Portions are great, the prices are great and although it's a very small location, it has an old pub feel that is very inviting. This place is always my first choice when I'm craving a pint and some wings."}
{"text":"--- SUMMARY ---  Plus's - unintrusive servers who know when you need them (ours was, anyway) and really good chicken wings (even the left overs)  Minus's - ribs   --- MORE DETAILS ---  Came here for a beer and chicken wings after some rock climbing. Inside looks like a tavern (apparently the interior has pretty much stayed the same for the past 10 years) - furniture made of wood. Very cozy and comfy.  ordered their Wednesday special - 1/3 rack of ribs and chicken wings for $14.  fries were good - you can actually taste the potato :P chicken wings were absolutely amazing. highly recommend chicken wings! I ordered honey garlic - the wings were tender and the taste semi-exploded in my mouth ^___^ definitely get the wings!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best place for chicken wings and beer. Not very big inside but that's one of the things that lends this place it's cozy atmosphere. This is one of the few places that requires no arm twisting for our kids when we offer to go there."}
{"text":"The chicken wings are awesome! The best, in my opinion. The dry hot with the regular hot sauce on the side is mouth watering!  Delicious fries and the dill dip is super yummy!  I also love how you can ask for no fries and you get extra wings! The atmosphere of this new location is a bit heart breaking, doesn't have the character of a little local pub like the old location did. The servers I have had are always nice and friendly too.  If you just want delicious wings and fries, with nice service and don't care about the less then perfect atmosphere, then this is your place!"}
{"text":"I'm in LOVE with their wings and the dipping sauce! It's a very simple place but the wings always keep me coming back! I've never had better! The building has been sold and they will be closing down, such a shame!"}
{"text":"Ok so I have lived close by this place for the better part of 32 years and I had never gone here once.  Now I see why.  The woman at the bar said either my friend and I can sit at the bar or wait in line.  We saw 2 chairs in the heated patio area so we took them.    It was wing night so my friend and I decided to get large wings.  Man was it a lot of wings for a large but I was disappointed nevertheless.  One person talked about the dry wings.  That's still true.  I had asked for suicide.  I laughed.  I think mine was medium at best.  My friend ordered the hot and honey and even those weren't hot.  I guess it's what you call white person hot.  LOL  I can only lay blame with the fact that it was wing night and didn't want to deal with the BS. I'm like if you can't get it done the first time, then you'll mess up again.    Nothing changes I guess.  So I won't be making the same mistake again."}
{"text":"I dream about these wings each day of my life...  Around 28 years ago, I believe I visited this location for the first time. I may be wrong but I think it was that long ago.  Their wings haven't changed much. A little. But not much.   Can't say that I am in love with the franchise version, and was sad to see the generic packaging on their dipping sauce but man do I love their food...  If I could have a last meal on earth, it might just be these wings..."}
{"text":"I just love this place. andI have been going since it opened,  Its is consistently great. the food is the same each and every time. I always order the wings plain with the sauce on the side, I get the hot or suicide. I have had the honey garlic they are good but just not my taste. The wings are served with potato wedges, order well done and a wing or fry dipping sauce dipping sauce there secret recipe.   The place is full of regulars, its great to catch a game, with a beer and wings. Get there early they always seem packed.   The staff have been there since for years the service is good they do their very best to make sure that you have a good experience, since its so busy you may have to grab the servers attention.   The best wings in the city. They have take out as well.   (St Louie  bar and grill  is owned by the same family so you can get the same wings there)"}
{"text":"They have the best wings in toronto. No doubt. I ised to live here in canada about 3 years ago. I now live in california. To this day, i have not found a single resteraunt with better wings than bistro."}
{"text":"A wing joint with a bit of history, this location was one of the owners original wing restaurants before opening the popular St. Louis bar and grill chain. The food is served similar style with dill sauce and wings that are nice and crisp. The feel is more pub/ bar feeling than a restaurant or bistro. The crowd is blue collar but it has a homely intimate feel with tons of regulars. The walls are covered in memorabilia and there are tvs up on the walls for watching sports so lots to see/read while you're there. The wings are some of the best in the city in my opinion. Some of the staff are a little quirky, had a waitress that called my fiancé and I by just boy and girl the whole service. 3.5/5 Go try the wings, great for a sporting event. Better for take away."}
{"text":"Lets cut to the chase here, Bistro is one of the two original iterations of what has now become the Ontario franchise giant, St. Louis Wings and Ribs. The product is almost identical but what sets \"The Bistro\" apart is it's personality, which it has in spades. It's unpolished and it is beautiful. The staff there are all friendly and have been there for years. This is a great wing joint whether you are out for a family dinner or are \"POUNDING BEERS WITH THE BOYS!\".  A quick anecdote: I've easily been coming to The Bistro for twenty years. Some of my favourite childhood memories are sitting with my father eating wings before we drove down to Leafs games at the Gardens. Needless to say the memories have grown a little less cherry as I've grown older. Want to know the world's most depressing feeling? Calling up for a single takeout order and having the guy on the other line not ask you the name on the order because he recognizes your voice! But don't worry, silver lining...I brought this up to my father and he had experienced the same situation; So we wallowed in our collective crapulence together, which was nice.  Despite this horrid trans-generation revelation The Bistro still has the best wings in the city and I will love it forever."}
{"text":"This place is owned by the guy who started the first St Louis. He makes sure he lets everybody know about it. Newspaper clippings and other pictures posted all over the wall.  Looking at the menu, it looked very familiar to St Louis. However when the food came, i was wrong. It shows why this establishment is so popular. Everything had a home made taste compared to the franchise. The sauce on the wing was magical in a sense. The wings looked dry but full of flavor. I dont know what sorcery was used to pull this off.  Crunchy wings that explode with flavor-YUM!!! ...must try for wing enthusiasts."}
{"text":"Love the wings. They are undeniably good. But it is other things have put me of the Bistro.  The Bistro is a great small pub brimming with energy, and a good regular group of customers.  I wont go again until my kids are of age. Reason: they were just rude to us when we came in with kids. For this they get knocked down 2 stars. Frankly the wings have never disappointed in the many many times have have gone.  The owners were clearly out of touch with the community with their active support of a \"laughing stock\" mayor in a community that never showed any support for that mayor.  Too bad really because I used to use the Bistro as a neighbourhood meeting place."}
{"text":"The Bistro On Avenue Road is one of those Classic Wing joints.  Originally it was the Bistro on Avenue along with St.. Louis Bar & Grill.  They both had the exact same recipe for their wings.  St. Louis Bar & Grill took off and expanded across Ontario.  The Bistro on Avenue kept to its roots and made wings better than ever!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A pub with only \"industrial\" beer no craft beer. Nothing on menu but wings & ribs. Wings served with \"coleslaw\" which tasted like sauerkraut with mayo added YUCK.  Server seemed to want to hurry us out...turns out she did it was end of her shift. Go across street to Firkin. A chain but way better than this poor excuse for a pub...a bistro--are you kidding!"}
{"text":"I once loved this place. Thought they were the best but I have to say that I find the wings subpar. A little over cooked and under flavoured. The wait staff is passive only catering to regulars.  We haven't been back since we lived in the neigbhourhood (8 years ago) and I don't think I will go back. even though they gave us a coupon for a free meal. Why would I go back and have bad wings...again?"}
{"text":"So good! My boyfriend and I went on a Monday and got their Wings & beer combo for $25, you can't go wrong. There was exactly the right amount of food for the both of us and we really enjoyed it. The wings aren't super saucey, and I prefer a sauceier wing, but still great. The dipping sauce was excellent and they weren't skimpy on giving us more as my boyfriend loves a good dip. The fries are more like British chips which was awesome too. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The original St Louis has become probably the worst wings you can eat.  Your wings will come cremated.  Burned to a crisp. I couldn't make out if they were serving me wings or chunks of coal.  Do you guys even care anymore?  This used to be the best wings and you turned it into a disaster. I thought maybe you guys had an off day and ordered them again months later.  Nope.  The second time around they looked like they were in the  Chernobyl nuclear power plant.  I actually like my wings well done which is the Ironic thing.  What a shame.  Just make room for condos rather than this disaster."}
{"text":"It's still as good as ever, but that was never more than 4 stars anyway. I didn't really think the 70s dive bar atmosphere of the old location was any good anyway, so I don't really see any change there.   For those coming from St. Louis restaurants - the wings are identical in taste but bigger rather than the pigeon-sized wings you get at St. Louis, and you get plenty more fries and better specials. Basically - this is 1 step up from St. Louis Wings."}
{"text":"You are either going to love them or hate them...and I have loved these wings for 30 years - straight.  The restaurant is perhaps...not as good as it once was. A little manufactured and less old school as before, but the wings are still the best in Toronto - bar none. The fact that some people don't like them is fine - but they are the most flavorful chicken wings I've had on this great green earth...  God Bless Louis Nemes!"}
{"text":"Bistro has been cooking up the best wings in Toronto for a long time now. Crowned as the \"original\" St. Louis Bar & Grill, Bistro takes its wings seriously. The \"hot\" and \"suicide\" sauces are mouth watering. Tuesdays have become a weekly gathering for a group of us, as the restaurant offers half-price wings every week (along with most other wing places on this same day). The new location is a bit odd, but the food has stayed exactly the same, so suck it up and go get your chicken wing fix."}
{"text":"This place is still good, the chicken wings are still scrumptious and the fries with the creamy fill dip are delicious! The onion rings were a little disappointing, but mostly because they didn't taste like fresh onion rings, more panko-esk with really thick outside (which I did not love).   Service was average at best, our waitress was not particularly attentive (which was surprising considering we were eating a geriatric dinner and the place was empty).   The ambiance is not as cute or \"bar/tavern-y\" as the old place was, but there is a lot more seating now"}
{"text":"If you love tiny dry burnt wings, cold undercooked frozen fries, terrible domestic beer, and dozens of Rob Ford articles on every wall, then you will absolutely LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"The Bistro on Avenue used to be a few blocks south of where they are now.  It was an intimate little place - a pub like atmosphere with probably the best wings in GTA at the time...  Now, it has gone a bit high end, much brighter and obviously a newer decor.  It lacks the \"atmosphere\" that used to exist at the old place.  Small TV's to watch sports, not very strategically placed.  On to the Service (I'll mention the food last).  Service was decent.  Sitting in the bar area, the bartender was the server.  She was quite busy, but still managed to pay attention to everyone around her.  I would give her a 4 out of 5.  Food...biggest disappointment.  Perhaps I have HUGE expectations having been a former regular customer of the old location in the 80's...  Ordered standard Honey Garlic wings.  Fries used to have more flavor - they tasted so plain now.  Even the Dill Dip - which was one of the main reasons anyone would order fries there - seemed somewhat tasteless compared to how it used to be and compared to the same dip found at St. Louis which the owner founded.  Onto the wings...the first order of wings came out tasting burnt and didn't have any sauce on them.  After telling the bartender, they were replaced - honestly, they looked like someone just poured sauce over them - still tasted burnt, they weren't as meaty as they used to be at the old place and the sauce??? really didn't taste much like honey garlic.  Did I eat them? sure.  I kept hoping they would get better with each one - but they didn't.  The only plus was the Pint was the right temp and drowned out the burnt taste.  Would I go back? Of course - I would never right off a place with such history and reputation simply because of ONE bad experience.  But, I would go with friends to confirm that my thoughts are feelings were either confirmed or refuted.  Not sure what the rest of the place has to offer since I stopped in to catch the end of the hockey game and have a pint."}
{"text":"I had been going here since the mid-late 90's with my best friend ... time change, and I ended up going to the St. Louis Franchises (which is owned by the daughter) around the city until recently where I came back for a meal right after landing in Toronto from London, UK a couple of weeks ago.  The wings were not overdone. They were perfect (unfortunately, the consistency varies from location to location). Slightly saucy and the fries are great. The dill sauce is amazing! I have a tough time deciding \"do I dip the fries in the dill sauce, or use ketchup\" ...   Whether it be a St. Louis or Bistro on Avenue, the food is always a hit if you want wings and fries. You can't go wrong.   Tip: Large Hot + Fries if you're really hungry!"}
{"text":"Good luck finding better wings anywhere on the planet. I tried!"}
{"text":"You know what..this place is so good and bad at the same time in my opinion. The wings are just alright..I would enjoy Duffs or Buffalo Wild Wings chicken more to be honest, but this place is still alright."}
{"text":"The owner also created a chicken restaurant as well as St Louis that he gave to his kids which they turned into a franchise and named it after him.   The wings are cheap on Tuesdays and boy were they good. Taste better than St Louis if you ask me (but similar) staff is relaxed and helpful. Feels like a pub that wants to be open because they enjoy it, not because they want profit."}
{"text":"This is another one of our favourite take-out joints. Haven't had a sit down meal there in years so can't really comment on that aspect.   The wings have become the gold standard for me. The wings are marinated so are moist and flavourful. Somehow they end up darker than wings from other places so you don't get distracted with the look of the chicken skin.  The hot and honey flavour is the ideal combo of sweet and heat without the sweat.  Fries are the wedge style (I like the skinnier, deeper fried ones, again, why am I not 300lbs) and of course the creamy dill dip is a great complement to the wings.    Maybe I need to get out more and do a wing-off.  I seem to remember great wings from Wheat Sheaf but it's been so long.  But then again, as my recent experience with Duff's proved, why depart from a tried and true favourite?"}
{"text":"Great spot. This is a neighborhood hole in the wall. I've had the \"steamed burger\", pretty good but nothing special. The real winner is the wings.  Other reviews seem to be trying to cut them up, but I'll tell you they are good, fresh, and well made. Dry Cajun is top class, as is the in house dill dip. On Mondays, you can get two and a bit pounds of wings with beer for $25. You shan't regret it."}
{"text":"Nice cozy bar, great food, service with a smile. Had a beer watched the game, ate some wings - ideal quiet evening with the boys. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"In one word - Disappointing..  I've checked out this place earlier this week after reading the good reviews they posted on their Window.  I went there with a few friends and we all seemed to agree that the place is not the greatest.. First of all the service was slow, Second of all the wings were over-cooked and cold..  We ordered 5 dished of wings, all of them were pretty cold. The wing tasted OK but not more then that.. My advice is, if you are a real wing lover go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I might return for the free meal (only).  Would you?  A few observations from my visit:  - Wings were dry, typical St. Louis-style.  Flats were skimpy meat-wise. - Waitress correctly advised me on wing style... I agree the \"hot\" were not very hot. - Dill sauce great with anything as usual - Waitress didn't do the \"how are things\" check-in. - Found a bit of white glop at the bottom of our pitcher (covered area of two loonies maybe?).  Waitress says \"that's not good\" and leaves.  Comes back with two free wings and fries coupons. - The lunch \"specials\" include large wings and fries for $13.95.  Note the special is part of the menu, hence is really the lunch price.  They charged me the regular $18.95 (they corrected it).  Why isn't this programmed into the cash?"}
