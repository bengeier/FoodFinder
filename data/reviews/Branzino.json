{"text":"Upon walking in at Branzino I feel mesmerized by the beauty of the place and greeted warmly by Pierre their manager. We start the evening the most amazing Caesar salad which has just the right amount of garlic and the greens are super crunchy. My friend opts for the soup a cream less wonder that as I taste it I am embellished in a world of exotic aromas. Branzino is obviously a fish place and the sea bass was as fresh as if we were sitting in a Taverna in Santorini. Simply made and beautifully presented I am impressed with the whole dish. The bread served at the table is all homemade and the focaccia is my favorite, trying to cut on carbs I was failing miserably because it was just that good. I am there to try their short rib since I've been hearing rave reviews from so many since it's opened. One of the most amazing dishes that I have tasted a piece of meat so tender that I forget to use my knife and quickly finish it off before my friend can ask to try it. I wish we had gone with more friends so that we could have tried more dishes. Sitting close to the kitchen I could see and smell wonderful plates coming out and being served to the patrons. Surprising to say considering it's a Hotel restaurant situated in the Meridian the prices were more than reasonable and the service up to par with some of the best places in the city. It always seems that I try to keep my favorite places a secret but Montrealers will thank me for revealing this gem located just west of Guy on Sherbrooke street."}

{"text":"came here based on recommendation from the front desk staff at chateau versailles, which is right across the street (you can put food/drinks on your room tab). when we arrived around 8pm on a sunday night the place was empty but had a cozy, warm feel, decor was romantic. service was friendly, helpful and i ordered the duck breast with scallops ($26). other folks ordered the salmon, risotto, beef ribs, burger and we were all happy. presentation was gorgeous, the duck and scallops were tender and cooked perfectly, came with root vegetables, mashed potatoes, and port reduction - delicious."}
{"text":"Branzino is a great restaurant. Don't be deceived by the fact it is associated with a hotel. The chef knows his business and after consuming three yummy lunches I can say quality of the food is top notch. Salads were inventive, extremely fresh, well balanced in terms of ingredients or in one word delicious. My companions loved their soups. The main courses I had were more simple combinations, but very well executed. 

The restaurant itself is cosy, the dark wood interior is superb and makes you feel comfortable. Our group of ten was well taken care of, food was served orderly and on time. I would definitely come back to try the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Food good. Customer service sux. Sitting at the bar 15 min with an empty beer while the bartender just disappears and the waitress rather talking to her friend than serving is unacceptable"}
{"text":"I've tried this restaurant for the 'Montreal a Table' event that offers menus at $21, $31 and $41. At Branzino, you have the choice between 3 appetizers, 3 main dishes, and 3 desserts. 

The place is well decorated, good if you're looking for a romantic place.

I had the beef cheek as my main dishes, the meat was tender and veggies delicious. The chef comes from France and made something from his region of origin.

For my dessert, I had a Half Baked Chocolate Dessert, that also comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a shot of salted caramel. This is also really good.

I'll try this place outside of the event, even if it's a bit pricey."}
{"text":"We came to Branzino for our friend's 35th birthday. We were pleasantly surprised with what we got. The decor is intimate and romantic yet casual-chic. Does it make any sense? We were a group of 30 and had a table d'hôte menu that offered us a few choices of entrées, main and dessert for 35$/pers. The wine list is quite funny as they categorize it by \"moods\" like adventurous, romantic, relax... lol. The prices were really good. We got the Francis Coppola Merlot 2015 for 53$. It cost 23,60$ at the SAQ. Our food came out really good except my entrée. Hubby and I got:

- Smoked salmon and poches egg with asparagus (this is the one i didn't like. The egg wasn't good...)

- Mushroom \"tart\". It was more like mushrooms on a puff pastry band. We enjoyed that.

- Filet mignon (main)

- Magret de canard (main)

Both protein dishes were cooked to perfection and had a celery root/mashed potato purée and broiled veggies. Bravo to the kitchen team that managed to give out well executed food to 30 hungry humans! Service was very good! Nothing bad to say about it. The only\"funny\" thing is the billing. We were charged for the tips (gratuity) which is common for groups. But here's where it gets weird. Our friend that was by himself got 10% charge on his bill. Hubby and I got 20%!?! It doesn't make sense. Shouldn't it be the same for everyone regardless of how many people is on that particular bill? The waitress couldn't really answer that for us :(

All in all, it was a fun night at a hotel's restaurant!"}
