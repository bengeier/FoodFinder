{"text":"Walk past this twice a day and am rarely tempted to stop.  Big vats of food sit all day. Long lines at lunch.  If you get there for noodles early, they are passable, but most dishes are oily and unappetizing.  Better options exist off campus just a short walk away."}
{"text":"Typical cafeteria-style greasy chinese. Small portions, cold egg rolls, dry meat.  I ordered the pepper steak (which was all bell peppers and no meat) when I asked for more meat, she poured on some sauce. I said, no meat and she said that's enough (lol). I responded, well this is enough $ for you nothing - see ya!  Also, a server wiped their nose over the food - gross!"}
{"text":"nice and chip Chinese food. my favorite is noodle with salmon and some other seafood. if the restaurant can change list more often, I will give it 5 star"}
