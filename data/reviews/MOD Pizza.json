{"text":"I didn't apparently get the entire \"MOD Experience\" (that I've seen people on here complain of) as, I had to leave. I called ahead to ensure that this location had gluten-free pizza. We entered MOD & were not even greeted. We had to engage the employees in a greeting, etc. We then attempted to order 1 regular pizza & 1 gluten-free pizza. The girl who was reluctantly assisting us asked if the g-free pizza was a preference or an allergy. We stated (allergy) at which point she reached in the cooler/freezer to pull out a pre-made g-free crust (she did not change her gloves, & actually took a regular crust off an aluminum pan & put the g-free crust directly on the contaminated aluminum pan). I will NEVER eat @ this establishment & I would recommend that anyone who has to eat g-free to avoid this place."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times now and service has always been good. My bf and I both love pizza and, due to my many food sensitivities, this concept is great... We get to both have our own pizzas exactly how we want them.   My main wish for MOD is that they come out with a vegan friendly red sauce. I have to be very careful with dairy consumption and while I'm very thankful for their dairy free cheese.. Their only red sauce is not dairy free... I understand they have bbq sauce and garlic rub... But to me pizza isn't pizza without red sauce :("}
{"text":"it's decent pizza. for $10 it's a good size, but the pizza is still so small that it seems like they're a bit stingy with toppings. also not enough cheese! i wish they had put more on, because that would have made a difference. however, i didn't want to ask for more- not sure if they charge that as an \"extra topping\" & i did not want to pay extra for what would be considered average cheese. the customer service was great and everyone was friendly and polite. the store itself was clean and nicely decorated. not sure if i will be back yet. the double mod is very good too, but a bit expensive considering it's not that much bigger of a pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza here is delicious.  Mod could stand for modern cause they have vegan cheese too!  Big pluses:  *they have crushed ice  *their trash has three areas for recycle, trash, and compost. It's a lot of fun to sit by the trash receptacles and see whether or not people are throwing their trash in the right container. A heads up- they usually don't. COME ON PEOPLE.  But food is good, service is great."}
{"text":"GREAT PIZZA! EVEN GREATER PRICES! The food was definitely worth the wait and every penny"}
{"text":"I had my first experience at here and it was amazing. The staff manager made us feel very welcomed and explained the menu since it was our first time there. The pizza was amazing! It had great flavor, wasn't expensive and was low in calories!"}
{"text":"Overall pizza was decent. Would have rated it hunter of the crust wasn't burnt on the bottom. Will give it a second try to see if it comes out less over done. Price was good and it was a great size."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Everyone can get EXACTLY what they want w/o a bunch of extra charges. They have great GF pizza and amazing salad ingredients.  Fresh food, great price, great quality! Friendly and helpful staff too!"}
{"text":"We went in late and we were still greeted with smiles and fantastic serves. Great pizza and salad. Thank you"}
{"text":"MOD Pizza is absolutely incredible!! I am now boycotting all other pizza establishments until they step up their game. I have visited MOD at least ten times since they opened near Metrocenter!! Where else can you get unlimited toppings with your choice of sauces for the same price every time? No coupons needed!! The thin crust cooked inside their magical oven is always right..the toppings are fresh and their sauce options keep me trying something new. The best part about MOD so far is the staff!! It is a good feeling to be served by happy people! They are attentive to their customers and make you feel welcome!! Keep up the great work MOD!! Until we meet again..probably tomorrow  Tim P"}
{"text":"Best pizza and salad we have had in a long time. Great space, chefs are gracious and helpful. Did I mention the marion berry lemonade or the caramel honey iced tea. They prepare your salad and pizza with fresh and flavor filled meats, veggies and cheese. Put some of the money you save in the tip jar. You're going to love the prices most of all - until you get your meal!"}
{"text":"NOT GLUTEN FREE FRIENDLY Great place on all other counts, but the offering of a GF crust is misleading. I have been to other, similar chains, and the employees have been trained and take care to keep from cross contaminating. Not the case here - and employee was irritated when I asked about it.  I wouldn't recommend the salad either if GF as it is also highly contaminated.  If you DO NOT have an allergy, you will love this place!"}
{"text":"Got takeout from here.  The service was lackluster at best.  Being ignored is maybe a fun gimmick in Mew York or Paris but not Tempe.  The pizza reflected the lackluster vibe.  We won't bother again.  Couldn't even spread the topping close to evenly."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here quite a few times.  All the topping choices you could want, EXTREMELY affordable for lunch or dinner and the most helpful and friendly service you could ask for!  They have multiple sizes for the pizzas to fit everyone.  Even the mini is very filling.  We'll keep coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I went here twice for work. The first time I had a thin crust pizza with goat cheese artichoke and balsamic dressing on it. My coworker had a pizza salad. The pizza dough did not have any flavor but the rest of the pizza tasted well. The line was long and the food came out quickly. My coworkers salad was fresh and crisp."}
{"text":"Bomb! I love mod so I finally checked this one out and it was bomb a guy from the metro location was there so off the rip I was excited! They were my peoples but anyway the pizza was delicious as always and the ingredients were crisp and fresh as could be ! Will def be back for more !"}
{"text":"Bomb! I love mod so I finally checked this one out and off the rip I was excited! anyway the pizza was delicious as always,i got the calexico, with some slight (mod)ifcations lol i crack myself up, anyway the ingredients were crisp and fresh as could be ! Will def be back for more !"}
{"text":"Everyone thinks they are a critic. MOD has an awesome atmosphere with friendly and helpful staff. They have great house lemonade and ice tea. Being that it is a build your own pizza place the pizza is only going to be as good as the toppings that you chose for it. Just as with a Chipotle Burrito or a Subway sandwich. If it tastes bad it's because you chose bad toppings. I am a big fan of MOD even only being there four times. I recently went to another place close to Mill that was similar but it just didn't execute like MOD."}
{"text":"This is a new place that was recommended to me by a co worker. I must say this is the BEST deal in town. The thin crust pizza is really good and is made to order which I like. The fact you get to choose your toppings is the best. The restaurant is clean and a relaxed environment. Plus for 2 people with 2 drinks out less than 15 bucks. Will definitely recommend to anyone. 5 starts plus"}
{"text":"Great place. I like to pay by the size not the topping. Thin crust, good sauce, anything I want on it for no extra. Quick service. I will certainly stop back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. The pizza is great. I don't have a favorite pizza just yet because I'm trying every pizza that is on the menu. I would take friends and family there because they can choose their own toppings. The people that work there are polite, and energetic even when they are rushed."}
{"text":"I love this place.  They have great pizza and reasonable prices.  I just wish you could order online in quarter-hour increments.   When you go in, it only takes like 10 minutes to make your pizza if they are not busy, but if you order online and you are like 1 minute after the hour or half-hour mark, you have to wait an entire hour to pick up your pizza!  That's super inefficient."}
{"text":"Keishah and Jenny hooked it up. Get the seasonal pizzas... OMFG! Fast delicious friendly and very high quality."}
{"text":"Walked in and was greeted kindly. Didn't know what to expect. Never been to mods but was amazed on how great the pizza was. Subway/Chipotle style pizza where you build your own pizza the way you like it, the idea is brilliant. Highly recommend this place !!!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite pizza place!  I love that I can build my own veggie pizza just how I like it!  The service is fast and employees are nice."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Last time the mega was cut into sixes. This time I got it cut in fours and asked for it to be fixed. Was told to wait while she finished cutting and boxing other pizzas. I finally walked away. They seem disorganized. I got two super large slices and two small slices. Tasted good though."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and terrific customer service.  Kai, the manager seem genuinely invested in making sure everyone in our party was happy and satisfied.  Dont miss this one!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! This pizza joint totally fills a food void in this neighborhood. So happy to be picking up my pizza and salads for the third time, tonight!!!"}
{"text":"Currently my favorite build-your-own pizza place. The crust is delicious and better than the others. I really like the different suggested pizzas; very creative. Their atmosphere is nice and plenty of room to sit. They go the extra effort by serving your pizza on an actual plate and they have several extra plates already positioned at each table for the convenience of sharing. Their beverage station is nice and has more than just soft drinks; especially great for the non-soda drinkers.   Is this the best pizza I have ever had? No. But for the category of price and fast-food; I don't see how they could do better. For that reason I am giving them a 5 Star Rating."}
{"text":"Great selection of toppings for a build your own MOD, in addition to a handful of recommended pizzas on their menu. The staff is always very welcoming here. I haven't tried their salad yet, but it looks delicious too!"}
{"text":"Awesome addition for Madison. On my way to the Dells and caught their grand opening!  Great stuff MOD and another location for me and my family!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and even better people! Staff is always friendly!! We are frequents, visiting at least 1x per week and they even remember our names and order."}
{"text":"Great place!  As I was driving by there was a guy giving out free samples. I was not hungry but took one to be nice. As I was driving away I ate my free slice, turned around, went back and bought a pizza. This place is delicious!!! Fantastic toppings. Super friendly and killer pricing. Eat here! You will be hooked!!!  Add roasted figs and goat cheese as topping choices! Please!!!"}
{"text":"With over 100 pizza parlors and Italian restaurants in the area, the pizza has to be really good for me to take notice. Mod Pizza on Bell and 75th next to Zupa's is worth 5 stars. Fast, quality ingredients, friendly service, and most importantly: great taste.  I ordered my own creation. Anchovies, mozzarella and Parmesan cheese, mushroom, red pepper, jalapeños on crispy thin crust wood fired to perfection. You walk through a cafeteria style line and choose your own ingredients. A few minutes later I was enjoying a flavorful 11\" pizza with a fresh side salad for $13 and some change. When I was done I didn't feel like I had eaten a heavy meal, this is due to fresh quality ingredients and the thin crust. Cool comfortable dining room with very cool music. I sure hope this place makes it."}
{"text":"Love this place! Being able to create you own pizza fresh as you go through line is ideal. I love thin crust, so it certainly works for me, and the toppings are not extra!!! This is our new pizza spot...it's delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Friendly  and  clean.  The pizza is delicious, and the amount of toppings available are amazing.  Highly recommended  $"}
{"text":"My friends raved about how great this place was, and my fiancé and I had a bad experience. It was Saturday night, so the place was packed. We were waiting in line that wrapped all the way out the door. The guy who I assumed to be a busser (short, brown hair, light gray shirt, no hat, white converse, and jeans) tried to squeeze past us to clear a table and said \"heads up\". I thought that was entirely rude, but I brushed it off, it was busy. Then he proceeds to come back towards me and throws trash into the trash can right in front of my face, and didn't say a single thing. The trash could have hit my face had I moved up an inch more. It was disgusting and the guy couldn't have cared less. He proceeded to act like this the remaining time we were there and while we were trying to get drinks. I don't give bad reviews unless they're bad. I will absolutely not be returning."}
{"text":"Been here several times, and love it! Very friendly staff and the pies are soooo good. Seem to be very interested in connecting to the community, which is also awesome!  Favorite custom pie: MOD Sized, with red sauce, pepperoni, mushrooms, roasted garlic, and black olives."}
{"text":"5 stars for value and taste.  Fresh ingredients Priced right for budget minded As many toppings as you decide 11 inch pizza was just right for hungry man time  Will visit again, Thanks"}
{"text":"always the best place to go when you want fast great service and especially great food at great prices. Love MOD all over Phoenix."}
{"text":"Ok...so we went to have pizza tonight....wasnt really in the mood for it....walked in saw the food on people table...eyebrows raised....ordered what i would consider my ultimate pizza...if i had a pizza bucket list of things to put on it....this would have been number one...loaded pizza with almost everything...for 7.50....going for it...less than 10min later...here it was...first bite ...taste buds in over drive. Pizza was amazing.....brian and his staff were very friendly....my only complaint is that the pizza has an addiction quality that makes me want to go back again and tell everyone about the place...goodluck mod pizza"}
{"text":"Good pizza, but we must have gone in on an off night for the staff.. they made no effort to acknowledge us. When we walked in, there was no one else in line, and being our first time there we weren't sure where to order..so we walked up to the first counter, & were ignored..\"humm perhaps we went to the wrong counter?\" So we walked to the other one..still nothing (but about 6 people working or standing around behind the counter area) But, our question on which counter to order at, was soon answered, as a woman walked in and went right up to the first place we stood, and proceeded to place her order.. uh okay, whatever.. we walked over & stood behind her & right back at the 1st place we started . Now mind you there were no other customers waiting in line, just the two of us.. and the guy taking our order rushed us to the point you'd think there was a fire & he had to evacuate asap.. but, after he got our pizza sizes & sauce order, it was on to queen grumpy pants.. zero personality, & asking her a question was like asking for the world.. just crappy attitude and disinterested. Then the wait was a bit excessive, & a quick side note **if you have the curiosity to try the carmeled pear iced tea DON'T it's hands down the nastiest tasting liquid I've ever tried.  The pizza was good once we got it, but the vibe killed the mood and I was eager to leave."}
{"text":"Today was a good day!!! I stopped my MOD pizza for lunch after seeing pictures from friends on fb and social media was blowing up with MOD reviews, so of course I had to try it out! The atmosphere is fun and the staff if very informative. Everyone smiled and was very patient to those who were possibly overwhelmed after all they did have over 30 toppings to choose and you  put as many toppings as you want to on top all for alittle under 8.00! I will be back! Even the management staff was all out there meeting and greeting and assisting their staff. Brandy  (I believe is her name) she was very informative chatting with every guest informing them of different choices and alittle history about MOD. She had everyone laughing... great job on this place!! Great managers,great staff this will be a popular spot I promise!!"}
{"text":"Love. This place reminds me of subway , but in away better pizza form! The pizza is delicious and you can put as many toppings as you want with no additional charge . The seating is cool and place is very modern. The sodas in a bottle were really good as well.Recommended for family/people who are picky eaters or like different things."}
{"text":"This is a nice concept.  Build you own pizza and salad.  A little confusing at first but they explained it well.  The food is great and it was kind of a fun experience."}
{"text":"So far the execution is poor. Ingredients not fresh. Would you like some SALT with your pizza? Don't know what kind of mozzarella they serve but it's not fresh and it's VERY salty with a rubbery texture. Crust is off too. Long wait. Warm, foamy beer on tap and not a fan of plastic utensils for a sit down restaurant. Save those for takeout. Last $ they will ever get from us. Probably one of the worst pizza concepts ever conceived. Marketing hype galore, but it means nothing if true food isn't good. Oh, well, guess we're driving back out to Scottsdale, where the only decent restaurants outside of Central Phoenix."}
{"text":"My pizza dreams have some true... friendly staff, obviously clean kitchen, very reasonable prices, and fresh ingredients for some seriously tasty pizza!    It's so refreshing to have a simple menu where your wallet isn't choked out just for adding an extra topping.  Unlimited toppings make this place truly unique.  Great business model, staff and addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Finally found a pizza place that is awesome!   I can load my extra cheese , meats, veggies etc and still get the same price.   Not to mention the people working there are so friendly.   You can have it your way; half white sauce, half red and it always turns out yummy!   We order large and it is still not enough lol.   I will be going back many times. because of the great staff, delicious pizza . I am very observant and noticed it's a great hang out for kids playing cards, feeling safe from high school,  just being kids in a safe environment. Great place to eat, hang out and know your kids are safe."}
{"text":"MOD pizza has always been a favorite place to go with my friends! It's delicious and the staff is always welcoming. This was my first time coming to the Scottsdale location and I was pleasantly surprised by the amazing service of Chris, who was helping us. He delivered the pizza right to our table and took our trash when we were finished. It was incredibly nice of him. He has amazing customer service skills and made this experience amazing for me and my good friend(: will definitely be back because of Chris."}
{"text":"Terrific place! Design your pizza: all the fresh toppings you could want, super friendly and nice staff, good OMB craft beer on tap. Good music selection. An oasis in the midst of suburbia. My new pizza joint for sure!"}
{"text":"I gotta love this place, custom pizza cost by size, not toppings. They even have a decent gluten free crust (not easy to find). The toppings are fresh, the pizza takes minutes in their super hot pizza oven. You can eat in, take out, or even order online and pick up. It can get pretty busy at times. But quite frankly, it's worth it."}
{"text":"I love this place.    So fast and quality  pizza.   Price is great you can go with friends and everyone can get what they want.    Great concept."}
{"text":"This place ROCKS!!! My daughter and I stopped in last week for lunch and were pleasantly surprised that we could order a salad on top the Asiago pizza crust, perfect!!!  The salad comes with whatever meat/veggies you want. For me, all the veggies & spring mix lettuce with extra roasted garlic, pesto, kalamata olives & a bit of Italian dressing. So Awesome! This combination was so yummy and the portion so large, I took the rest home for later.  Today I took my honey Phillip to try it & he was as pleased as we were/are. Great place!  The GM, Conrad, has got a good thing going here and has earned our future business and we will tell our friends & family to check them out. Thanks for having a classy establishment with great food!"}
{"text":"Great place! The quality of the ingredients seem pretty top notch. I have been to a few other make it your own way pizza joints and this place blows them all away."}
{"text":"Fast service, good pizza and quality toppings. You can also make a salad with their toppings selection. We like to take our dog with us and eat outside on the patio."}
{"text":"Tried it today for lunch. You get what you pay for, I suppose. Yes, the pizza is cheaper than what you'd pay for a good burger (think Dotty Dumplings Dowery), but with limp crust and toppings applied VERY sparingly, you'll wind up wishing you'd paid more and had a much more satisfying meal. It's an attractive concept, but to really make a substantial, flavorful pizza you'd have to charge more to make a profit. Too bad. Good pizza is really hard to find in Madison."}
{"text":"Love the thin crust friendly staff.  You get to choose your toppings and in 10 minutes you have your personalized pizza.   They also have the best Caramelized pear iced tea."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the Pesto Chicken pizza with mozzarella!! I can eat one daily! All my picky kids love the pizza too and the fact that you can choose the style of you want and the toppings! Salads look great too although I've never had one. Fresh!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this 3 stars because my daughter liked her pizza. Hubby & I didn't like ours. Crust is more like a chewy bread than a pizza crust. I like the idea of putting whatever toppings I want, but I feel like the pizza was very bland."}
{"text":"Been in quite a few times and I've gotta say most of the time it's not worth it. The things I've witnessed as a customer have certainly scared me away. Whether it's managers outside the store arguing or inside the store arguing it's unprofessional and not what I want when getting food. Nearly no one there has any idea what customer service is and it seems very hit and miss. The food is good especially for the price but that's only if they don't mess up your pizza. If there's a sauce at the end you want you'll probably have to remind them even though you've already asked once. My only good experiences in the store have been with a young man whose name I believe is Kyle, however from my experience he's the only employee there that understands customer service and has never messed up my pizza. Unfortunately 1 good employee isn't enough to keep customers, if I really get a craving I'll make sure he's working or try another location as for now I'm done with MOD."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, build your own thin crust pizza!  Salads are fine too. Lots of toppings to choose from. A winner for the Steele Creek area!"}
{"text":"A fast favorite but learn to love your neighbors...they'll practically be sitting in your lap due to tight line space and even tighter seating accommodations.  The one ingredient they need but dont have....honey.  Honey is the perfect drizzle on a spicey pie. BUT, nevertheless, this place rocks; despite the hipster domination, lol."}
{"text":"Was hoping for better. Not the worst. Nowhere near the best. I don't like that the pizza bases are sitting out on the trays, in stacks. That doesn't say \"fresh\". The music near the ordering area is too loud to hear the server explain everything, because the board isn't doing that. When I went to collect our pizzas the manager sprinkled something on them. Am guessing it was garlic powder because that's all I could taste after eating the pizza. Too much competition in this town for mediocre."}
{"text":"I'm so glad a co-worker suggested Mod Pizza for our lunch break today, because this place is awesome! Though I initially went in with the intent to get a BBQ Chicken or Hawaiian pizza, once I was on-the-spot with a million choices, all hell broke loose and I ended up selecting a strange combination of toppings. I believe it was along the lines of red sauce, mozzarella, parmesan, bacon, chicken, pineapple, jalapeños, and kalamata olives. WHAT EVEN. Baahahaha. Don't get me wrong, I love all of those things so I very much enjoyed my pizza, it's just that if you're an indecisive person, perhaps go in with a game plan so you're not overloaded with options. Or add ALLL the stuff and things because it's the same price anyways! I absolutely loved how thin the crust was! Service was super fast and friendly and the restaurant was plenty clean. The lemonade is on the tart side, but definitely good. As I was eating my pizza at Mod, I was already looking forward to coming back to create lots of new custom pizzas in the future! Well done!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great concept... Build your own pizza and the toppings are fresh. The staff was super friendly and efficient. I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Love that they make pizza in front of you! Pizza is so good. Sauce is on sweeter side, which I prefer. Thin crust. Really yummy. And it only takes them about 5 minutes to cook your pizza in the wood fire oven. Friendly service, great selection, excellent food."}
{"text":"I love it! Put whatever you want on the pizza, great crust fantastic, great toppings, delicious food & good price! And the lemonade is the best lemonade ever tasted! I don't know how I could recommend this place more!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch the other day with some friends and was pleasantly surprised!  I like pizza well enough but it's not usually my first choice.  What I really liked about Mod Pizza is that I can create my own pizza and there is a very small version so that I don't waste any or have leftovers. I love the concept of the smaller portions and putting what I want on the pizza.  I also loved the iced tea - I had the caramelized pear tea and it was delicious. Service was fast and efficient.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing!!! They have salad pizzas too and everything is fresh. The customer service was amazing. They went over and beyond just to make sure that my family's experience was great. Try the ham and bacon salad pizza with cheese and peppers. Any mixture of fresh ingredients will be delish. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good quality pizza that never fails in terms of quality.  Have had an issue with a phone order being botched with one pizza being omitted.  Overall, good pizza but has been out priced by nearby fired pizza across Dysart.  Surprised that they didn't counter being out priced by fired pizza?  Nice staff but have they grown complacent?  Time will tell."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza over the phone to pick up but the only lady working in the entire store didn't bother to make it to make things even worse she didn't apologize. I recommend not wasting your time ordering from this establishment"}
{"text":"Great pizza great service very friendly staff. Enjoy every time we go. Oven fire pizza."}
{"text":"Wanted to try out a new pizza place and OMG this pizza was amazing. Everyone who helped us were super nice and explained the whole proses to us!! The prices are great too! Best part is that you can get as many toppings as you want and it's all just one price. I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Insanely delicious! This place has the best pizza in town. The food is fresh and you can get whatever toppings your heart desires."}
{"text":"Have to work out the kinks on the online ordering. Set a time for 6:20. As I'm typing this it's 6:33 and no pizza. Looked promising when I walked in at 6:20 as there was a long line. Turns out all the people in line got their pizza before I did. Testament to the long line efficiency tonight, but not sure why I'm still waiting."}
{"text":"This place opened earlier this month and it's already become one of our regulars. The pizza is delicious and the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. Super impressed and excited to go back and try the lemonade another reviewer raved about!"}
{"text":"Very tasty food.  This is our 2nd visit and both times we found our meals to be deliscious and well priced.  The dillion james pie is very good, with a great crust.  My wifes salad was large and filling.  We also ordered the garlic strips which tasted good, but not worth the $2.97 price.  Two slight negatives.  The day we went was chilly and there was constant air blowing out of the vents onto us.  The other was that 4 to 5 employees sitting at tables by themselves as the dinner rush was on.  One employee actually laid her head on the table as if to be asleep, hair and all.  Just where I want to sit with my food."}
{"text":"Love! Love! Love MOD! Great pizza, awesome service and the guy at the register was very friendly! Will be regulars!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever. I crave it DAILY! I love the barbecue and the crust! The employees are so energetic and fun! Loves the atmosphere and food! Such a fun place to go with family and friends. Best date night space ever and the homemade lemonade is to die for!"}
{"text":"Visited once. I like the concept of personal pizzas.  Do not be fooled however by the \"as many toppings as you want\" marketing tool.  Clearly they are trained to keep the food cost down, so example if you order all pepperoni say you get 15 on the pizza, however if your order say sauasage, ham, onions, then they are trained to quarter each topping meaning you will now have about 6 pepperoni and each topping will be cut down by the same percentage. In the end you will have the same amount on your pizza weather it's one type or several. I believe the trick would be to say you want all of a topping then when they fill it and pass it, then change your mind and say you want 3 more toppings. Then I would be surprised if they portioned and removed the pepperoni in front of your eyes."}
{"text":"I live for pizza and this place has amazing pizza. You get to create your own and they have any topping you could ever want"}
{"text":"I liken this place to the subway of pizza, more for the construction of the pizza than the quality of taste and quality.  It's a fun experience to create your pizza without fear of driving up the cost.  I mixed the red sauce, white sauce, and pesto for my sauce and it was an awesome unique taste.  The pizza came out crispy and delicious for a fair price.. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I don't have a waffle love near me, so I make sure to come here when I'm in town. Hands down the best dessert waffle I've ever had. The grilled cheese is divine as well!"}
{"text":"Definitely good pizza, you walk in, the environment is lovable and very sizable, but the staff is very unorganized and not sure of their next move. The pizza is fair priced, and it's definitely a cool place to take the kids. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff! Great toppings..all fresh!...I must of had 7 or 8??  The thin crust was superb...cooked in 4-5 minutes..best pizza for the $ for sure!"}
{"text":"Went to MOD for the first time tonight and was extremely satisfied by the service. The food was amazing and all the employees were so nice!! Definitely coming back again :)"}
{"text":"Love the crust. Nice and thin.  You can get as many toppings as you want for no extra charge. Only $4.77 for a personal size. Was made quickly and cooked perfectly. Restaurant was very clean. Can't wait to go back and try different toppings"}
{"text":"First time going to Mod Pizza. I was little concerned before going because I thought the wait time for the pizza was going to be 15 to 20 minutes like at a traditional pizza place. I was wrong, it only took about 3 to 4 minutes to cook.  The pizza was great! Very fresh toppings and lots of flavor. They also have nice selection of beverages like fresh teas and lemonade.  The staff were very friendly and helpful too. The restaurant was very clean. Real plates instead of paper is nice touch too.  I highly recommend Mod and I will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Mr. B. and I stopped here Sunday for pizza to watch the Basketball game at home. Immediately upon walking in, we were greeted with friendly faces and courteous service. I'm a fan of 'Build Your Own Pie'; this is the only BYOP restaurant that I know of that offers 2 sizes. I was exceptionally pleased with the level of service at this location. The shift manager (young girl) was extremely engaged with her staff (something you don't see to often). The staff as also friendly and courteous. No matter what they were doing, every time someone walked in or out of the building, they were spoken to accordingly. The prep station was clean and inviting; the staff wiped up after each of order.  I LOVE greens but, I have yet to try their salads. But how can you go wrong? You control the outcome.  OASN (on a side note): The Marion Berry Lemonade is to die for! (One of these days I'm going to bring some home and mix with some vodka. LOL)"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. They don't skimp on your toppings and they have very friendly customer service. Wish the drink cups were bigger or cheaper but otherwise love everything!"}
{"text":"Make my own pizza... the chipotle of pizza. Much like Fired Pie or Pieology this place is the same concept except with better dough. Price is a great value as well."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here!  Great food and better customer service!  I ordered the Calexico pizza and modified it by adding sun-dried tomatoes, pineapple and mushrooms.  Great family place or a joint to hang-out.  Quick service and reasonably priced.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"I am giving this a one star for one major reason, portion size to price!  Horrible!  I ordered a small salad and a gluten free pizza, it was $20!!! The amount of lettuce in the salad was no lie, the size of my palm.  (TINY) It had 2 slices of tomato and like 5 tiny shreds of cheese.  Just incredibly skimpy for the price.  I wanted a small salad, but this was worth no more than $2!  I could have bought 2 entire bags of lettuce for $5 Overall, the quality is just OK, nothing fabulous or special.  I would say avoid and go to Sauce or Pie5 up the street.  Much more generous on portion sizes."}
{"text":"My wife and I go to this place and location so many times it's unbelievable! There's no better \"build your own\" pizza place in the entire valley (In my opinion)! We absolutely love when Lauren is working, she always greets us with a smile and makes sure to let us know how excited she is that we came in, she is seriously so amazing!   The food, each ingredient, tastes soo great! And also we really enjoy getting the original and strawberry lemonade and doing a half and half with them :)    All in all, this place is a great choice EVERY TIME and ya'll should definitely eat here!"}
{"text":"You absolutely cannot get a better pizza for the price! They use fresh ingredients and have a damn good oven. Very friendly customer service, and a decent beer selection. The fact that you can add as many toppings as you want without any additional charge is great!"}
{"text":"This place has a great concept & good for the whole family. The pizza is always fresh and you can never get bored with all the options! The staff, service, and food never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Had a coupon mailed to me, so I decided to try it. Buy one, get one 11\" pizza! I called and placed a to go order. Very quick and polite service! The pizza's really hit the spot! I ordered ham and pineapple on one and pepperoni and green pepper on the other! Great amount of toppings on each pizza! Will order again!"}
{"text":"Great place, great service! It's nice to have a local joint that still served the customers."}
{"text":"Had my first experience at MOD today and I am very pleased! It was around 5pm on a Saturday but it wasn't busy at all, in fact, we walked right up to order. The staff was super friendly and helpful. They must have been able to tell we were first timers so they explained the menu to us. I ordered a small (6in.) pizza and small salad. Both were great!!! My husband ordered a regular (11in.) pizza. His came out a little charred. I told him not to make a fuss about it on a count that everyone was so friendly and I didn't want to be a bother but he said he wouldn't eat it so he decided to take it back. The staff were quick to apologize and remake the pizza right away! After our meal, one of the employees walked up to our table and apologized again for the burnt pizza and handed us a card for a free pizza next time we come in. I highly recommend MOD, it's tasty, fast, and inexpensive. We paid just under $20 for the small salad, small pizza, regular pizza and a drink."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time last night. We were VERY impressed! The whole concept is awesome. We all like our pizzas a different way and MOD Pizza makes it easy for each of us to get our pizza just how we like it. They give you all the choices of ingredients anyone would eat on their pizza and the ingredients were fresh. The atmosphere is casual and very laid back. The employees looked like they were having a good time. We fed a family of three, including drinks and an appetizer for $33. It is our new favorite pizza place!"}
{"text":"The Chipotle method of pizza. Pick a size ($4.47 mini or $7.47 regular) then head down the line for unlimited toppings included. Fired up in the oven for you in just a few minutes. They also do two salad sizes down the line the same way. Unlimited fountain sodas, iced tea and some really sweet lemonade."}
{"text":"This pizza is delicious! Fresh toppings for a great price! Also the staff is very friendly and will definitely come back soon!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time and we will be back! We have passed this place many times and looked at the reviews on Yelp and decided to try it. It was good, quick, everyone was friendly and helpful. For 1 price you get exactly what you want on your pizza; no way not to love it. Also tried the salad bowl and it was GREAT! Mod Pizza will be one of our new go to places, as our kids love, love, love pizza!~"}
{"text":"We love coming to Mod Pizza.  The food and ingredients are always fresh and generous-portioned, with all the toppings you could ever want.  I really appreciate the very polite customer service as well.  The employees are always friendly and welcome us as we enter inside.  I'm a regular now and highly recommend over other \"fast\" pizza places due to the high quality and good people."}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza and a fresh salad.  Really fast but really good!  Staff is friendly and having a good time while they work...makes for a great vibe !  We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Fresh, friendly, and delicious! Three words to describe our favorite local pizza place. You can't beat this place. The choices are never ending and it's a fun way to enjoy pizza with the family! Check it out!"}
{"text":"I went to Chipotle for dinner one night. Decided to check out Mod Pizza next store. Got a menu from them for next time. Came back and had a women named Monica, I ordered from. Paul made Pizzas. Got my pizza, decided to dine in, instead of doing carry out. The pizza was great, decided to order another pizza and take it to go. I talked to Conrad and Tyler-General Manager. Very helpful answering questions. Everyone was nice, great customer service. I will be back again real soon. Mod Pizza came from originally Seattle, Washington. Many chains opened up in the last few years. Glad they came to Arizona.   Michael Katz Chandler, AZ"}
{"text":"Service was good. The food was great! Everything looked fresh, and I like the pesto sauce. I can order a customized pizza, fresh for cheap!  I am not usually a fan of anything except iced tea or water to drink, but I love the berry lemonade! We will be back! Please open one near Arrowhead!"}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good. But they are pretty stingy about extra toppings. Don't bother asking for extra cheese because they don't put it on your pizza unless you stare them down and ask for more a second time. They try to shove you down the line so that you don't watch them make your pizza. Sleezy. It happened on different occasions so I think they are trained to do that."}
{"text":"We thought the pizza was great and so thrilled I could get gluten free crust with all the toppings I want. Also the decaf carmelized pear tea was wonderful!!!"}
{"text":"Good pizza. Way affordable. Staff is a little uninformed and item chaotic and get behind on their orders. Got a free pizza bc of it! Lol"}
{"text":"So the service was fair once I received it. I went in to mod pizza and there was nobody in line it was just me. Guy looks at me welcomes me and then a bus driver (Commercial bus driver , not a city bus driver or school bus driver) comes in behind me and states that she's a bus driver and in a hurry and the guy doesn't even acknowledge me, doesn't say do you mind if I help this person?  or doesn't say give me just a minute this person's in a hurry! He just takes the person from behind me who came in about 30 seconds after me does her order and then comes back and helps me.   Now I'm not complaining that he help somebody else before he helps me, so much as I'm complaining about the fact that he didn't ask me since I was there first if it was OK, if he helped her because she was in a hurry. He just did so. No apologies nothing to me.    It's too bad that that's the service that I received because I really do enjoy eating at that mod pizza but there are other locations I can visit and hopefully they'll treat me better than that in the future.   By the way I still left before the bus was even full."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in town. I love that you can customize your own pizza here and they make it in front of you! The staff is always friendly and their food is always delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing Pizza, so fresh and flavorful.  Tons of items to choose from, but I like my Pizza simple.  Just some red sauce, pepperoni and pineapple.  Time it right and you're in and out in 10 mins."}
{"text":"Loveeeeeee this place and I'm so glad I found out about it! The workers are so sweet, enthusiastic, and welcoming - it's kind of contagious! There's a variety of toppings so that you can make the pizza of your dreams (Did I mention unlimited toppings?). I thought the size of the MOD pizza would be too small, but it was actually very filling. I will definitely be coming back as many times as I can to explore all the pizza options available!"}
{"text":"Pizza is hard to mess up but it's equally as difficult to stand out among every good pizza corner joint out there. MOD Pizza found that perfect mix to get it just right to Stand Out like World Trade one on the NY Skyline.  You can get just about anything you want anyway you want on the best soft flatbread. Brick oven fired and cooked in no time.  If you haven't had MOD yet then you're missing out. We love that this restaurant is so close we can ride our bikes. We'll be back soon. Del"}
{"text":"I've been unimpressed the last 2 times we've eaten here. All the pizza varieties we have tried were mediocre and took far longer than other personal pizza joints."}
{"text":"pass by here all the time. decided to see what it was about. was clean, ingredients looked fresh. service was quick. loved that they had more than just soda, beer, floats, lemonades and teas. will definitely return."}
{"text":"The concept of fast and gourmet pizza is genius!  Friendly (not fake) staff, good prices, and great thin-crust pizza. No charge for extra toppings!!"}
{"text":"Love MOD pizza and that every family member can build there own pie!!"}
{"text":"What an amazing idea. Love the idea that you can go get Pizza with friends or family and you can get exactly what you want and you don't have to decide as a group what kind of pizza to get. It's a thin crust pizza, I get the mini which is the perfect size and for less then $5 I can get as many toppings as I want. It is delicious!  The atmosphere is great and you can sit outside in a cute little patio area. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Gave them a 4, only because the place was hard to find via internet. Problem was fixed. So I'm changing it to a well earned 5. Gonna eat there today, so pumped."}
{"text":"This place was very good. Delicious pizza, very good service and relaxing environment."}
{"text":"Awesome.  This place is like chipotle for pizza at an extremely reasonable price.  This is our new go-to place for sitting down to have pizza.  We got 4 different pizzas and all were amazing (the Tristan was my favorite)  The staff were very friendly and made this place a great family-friendly spot. They gave the kids free milkshake samples, stickers, etc.  One of the team members played with my two year old a little bit while she was clearing tables.  A mistake was made with one of our pizzas - I originally said \"Number 3...oh wait, no number 2\" and it was accidentally read on the paper to make the number 3.  The final person in the line noticed the mistake and remade the pizza and gave us the mistake pizza for free.  Very impressed with our entire experience.  I can see no real reason to spend the time waiting for a place like Grimaldi's or Oreganos anymore if I'm primarily looking for pizza."}
{"text":"I have been here around 5 or 6 times now and this place is consistently very good and has amazing customer service. Everyone there has been extremely friendly every time I have gone and the food is always fresh, quick and delicious. Great price for all the toppings you desire on a pizza, definitely \"have it your way\"!   I hosted a girl's night out there last night and the workers were so friendly letting us stay past closing time (we were sitting outside) and making us feel welcomed. It was excellent! I'm a fan of Mod Pizza and this location."}
{"text":"Great pizza and salad!!  Great staff as well. A must try for a casual night out!  We had our kids with us and one of the employees came out with 3 frisbees!!  The kids loved it. Great place!"}
{"text":"Great place for those following a healthy, plant-based (vegan) lifestyle. I usually get a plain Mod crust with a garlic rub, then spinach, romaine, mushrooms, fresh tomato slices cauliflower or asparagus, chickpeas and a little rosemary. They cook it at a high temperature so quickly that the veggies don't make the crust soggy. We visit about once a week. Good stuff."}
{"text":"They did it again! This specific location always goes above and beyond to service the customer. As someone who has a gluten intolerance this location always asks if I would like the oven cleaner before they put my pizza in to cook. I feel 100% in being able to eat at this location. Thank you again!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Fired pizza with whatever topping I want not to mention a reasonable price.  Love the garlic pie with a dipping sauce.  And did I mention the house lemonade? The staff is always so friendly and I think they love hearing peoples own creations.  I had a worker say he was going to have to try my creation.  Yummers all around!"}
{"text":"First time here with husband and two year old son. To feed a normal family of 4 with drinks get ready to send about 60.00. The mod is the biggest size pizza and its 11 inches. Good favor good choice of topping to pick from. We had to clean off our own table and so did other guests. Not a bad pizza joint just alittle $$$ for my family"}
{"text":"OMG!!!! This place is so cool. We came in here by chance and we are so glad we did. The staff is super friendly. We didn't know how to order and they helped us through the process. SO easy; you just pick any of the toppings you want (too many to list; all excellent) for your pizza and salad. One price per size for all the toppings you want!! We will definitely be back and tell our friends. Do yourself a favor and stop in here. SO DELICIOUS!!!!"}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan.  I went to this location of Mod Pizza last night because I received a coupon in the mail for buy one, get one free.  I've only been to one other choose all the toppings you want pizza joint before, and compared to that place, this pizza was much better.  I would not want to eat the pizza on location, as it is sparse and not very inviting.  The pizza I took home, however was not sparse.  It was inviting and I ate the whole thing.  My girlfriend had Brussels sprouts on her pizza:  Is that legal?  Thanks, Mod.  Could you send me another coupon?"}
{"text":"Ordered a Jasper with 3 additional toppings.  Got home to find no additional toppings even though they had them explicitly marked on the order sheet.  Not happy."}
{"text":"My family and I came here and loved it! The staff was extremely nice and helpful. The pizza was yummy, and we also had some garlic strips and cinnamon strips. We really enjoyed it all! I got a salad with Caesar dressing, which I'm very picky about. And I was not disappointed! To top it all off, they came around and gave us vanilla milkshakes. Talk about great customer service!"}
{"text":"MOD pizza... I don't even know where to start! For starters, the place is awesome, and I always feel so welcome, when I walk in MOD, the people there always say \"Welcome to MOD!!!\" It's just so pleasant to be welcomed; it feels like home! Also, the people there are nice. The prices are cheap, and when you ask them to change a salad that looks old, they will do it happily for you! In case you didn't know how MOD works, you have a pizza and you can put anything on it. It's really like DIY pizza. I highly recommend this place for you."}
{"text":"A very interesting take on making a pizza. Great customer service when I went. There's a variety of toppings to put on the pizza. They even offer salads that you can create with the different toppings."}
{"text":"After stumbling into the original location on a recent trip to Seattle, we were anxious to see if the location closer to home provided the same great experience and quality. We were fortunately not disappointed!!    If you haven't been yet, MOD specializes in pies that can feed 1-2 and come in a ton of suggested combinations or can be made however you desire....all for one low price and available in 5 minutes.  Our family of 5 typically sticks with 3 or 4 pies and a salad.   The Matthews location has a nice corner spot providing tons of natural light and a large patio area. The staff was friendly and helpful and the quality and taste were off the charts.    We finished with a few 'no-name cakes' and everyone left full and extremely happy. Look forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"SO YUMMY. I LOVE this place. It's so wonderful to have a pizza option with high quality ingredients and great prices. You actually leave feeling not just full, but nourished. Tons of meat options, different sauces, roasted cauliflower, asparagus, broccoli, along with fancy cheeses, spices, and finish glazes. Amazing. Great staff and atmosphere too. THIS IS THE BEST PIZZA I HAVE EVER INGESTED. THANK YOU MOD PIZZA!"}
{"text":"Great food, lots of different choices for pizza. They even have some seasonal or limited time toppings, which are great.  Staff is very friendly and pickups are always right on time. Check out the local brews which is a plus if you are dining in."}
{"text":"Mod is great and cheap I love it here.  The new blonde girl isn't good at making pizzas.  They weren't crispy at all and they were soft... I don't come to mod for soft crust, I come for crispy thin crust, also she kept lifting her tshirt to show off her butt and was walking around pushing her butt out... ok....... why? I don't need a side of ass with my pizza. I want crispy thin crust....    ?? I'll be back but can you guys get someone else to make the pizzas"}
{"text":"I went on opening day and again the following week. I love the fired pizza and the fact that you can have them build the pizza just the way you like! When I'm craving pizza, I'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, I love pizza and having this Down The street from me is perfect. Super friendly staff; have lots of interesting types of pies, all which sounds tasty! You can make you own and add on toppings at no extra cost! Teas are refreshing and not to over sweet. They also have local beer on draft. No wings but they do have milkshakes and floats. So you can get something sweet during or after :)."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Very friendly atmosphere and great food options.  You gotta try it."}
{"text":"I love mod pizza. Sometimes the lines are long but its totally worth it. It is some of the best pizza known to man. They let you put as much toppings on the pizza as you want. There lemanade is also super baller."}
{"text":"love this place. subway but for pizza! wish their drink cups were larger! the tiny little cups make us get it to go and hit sonic for our drinks!"}
{"text":"Absolute rudeness and disregard for customers from all employees. My husband had to ask them to do their job since they were just standing around and were being unproductive. The cashier had an attitude on him and was very rude. Won't be going there again or recommending it to anyone else."}
{"text":"Amazing, fast, fresh, delicious. Mods pizza has a nice atmosphere and offers an array of options, will come back for more."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza!  The dessert pizza was to die for!!!  The service was great, one employee in particular Anthony K. has the BEST customer service skills.  He was very attentive to us along with the other guests.  Thank you all!  We will definitely recommend Mod pizza to others and will be back ourselves"}
{"text":"Let's start by saying I tried on 3 different occasions to order from here, and Everytime I called they answer \"Hello\" I have no idea if I've dialed wrong or a business. Not only that they put me on hold and never came back, well guess what I was determined to see what they had to offer, so I showed up 2 months later. Guess what I got what I should have known, not very good pizza...save yourself the aggravation and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Thin crust and any ingredient combination for a fair price...great staff and good vibe from this business."}
{"text":"Went last week for the first time to MOD.  Love how you can see them make your pizza and all the toppings.  Taking the kids soon for them to enjoy the great pizza and fun atmosphere.  Great staff working and a very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Very impressed! Great atmosphere and very good pizza. Surprisingly fast turn around after ordering. I got the Calexico pizza with a few modifications because I'm a big baby with spicy food. The girls at the front of the line were friendly and enthusiastic in helping me get what I wanted. The place is very clean and well put together. The dining room a bit on the small side but there is outdoor patio seating that will be nice when the temperature drops below 139 degrees.  Above all and most impressive to me was the staff. They seemed genuinely happy to be there and in making sure you enjoyed the experience.  Get there. Get some. Do it.  I will be back soon.   P. S. Try out the lemonade selection. Outstanding."}
{"text":"Great Service. Fresh Toppings. Great Pizza! Highly recommend for quality pizza Lovers!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad we tried this pizza. The service was excellent and very friendly. The crust is crispy and can hold the toppings. Such a great variety to pick from or order one of the speacalty pizzas. You must try the No Name Cake. Its an adult version of a Ding Dong. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Love MOD Pizza. Finally a pizza place where they allow you healthy choices to build your own personal sized pizza. I loved everything about MOD Pizza and would recommend it, if you don't like it, it's BC of the toppings YOU chose"}
{"text":"AWESOME PLACE!! Great quality pizza and customer service!! They're super friendly and welcoming every time you walk in! Stop by! You won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite pizza place!! We just happened to be driving by and saw it, so we decided to stop in. The staff was friendly and spoke to us as we entered. They explained our options. We got the mega pizza, which is two pizzas stacked on top of each other. It cost about $12. We picked our toppings and it took only FIVE minutes for our pizza to cook. They have stone ovens to cook the pizza quickly. The pizza was delicious!! We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Their pizza and salads are very delicious. The staff is always smiling and friendly, and their lemonade is tasty."}
{"text":"This was the 2nd time I'd eaten at MOD. The first was a couple weeks ago while travelling for work in Austin, TX. It was awesome there and just as awesome here. The fact that you can put anything you want on for one price is incredible.  I started with the Mad Dog and added garlic rub, pineapples, artichoke, ham, bacon, rosemary, Italians seasonings and salt and pepper. It then goes into a brick oven and only takes about 5 minutes to cook. After it was done, I had them add the pesto finish. Yum. Something I haven't seen mentioned in this locations review but have in the others is that if you go overboard on toppings, the crust can become a bit soggy, at least in the middle.. I tend to go overboard, but I knew the risk going in. And I'm sure that once the oven gets properly seasoned, it will get even better. I'm pretty sure they've only been open a short time. I got a fountain drink, but they also offer a couple beers on tap and some craft beers and even a few craft sodas. Next time, it'll be Birch Beer for me."}
{"text":"Stopped after game at Panda Express.  Line was out the door so kids stayed there and we decided to try MOD.  The line was long but not near as long as Panda.  Waited and waited and finally ordered a #4 Mod Dominic pizza.  Took forever-only 2 young teens working.  The manager walked out and left them alone.  Kids had gotten their food at Panda and finished eating while we were still waiting for pizza.  Pizzas came out burnt and people had to wait for them to make another one.  When ours came out burnt I asked for refund and will not return to this location.  Shame on the manager for leaving those boys alone when they needed assistance."}
{"text":"THE CHIPOTLE OF PIZZA! Love this place. Originally all over Seattle Washington and now in the desert!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I love building my own pizza and having a set price. Even bigger plus- Papago's Orange Blossom is on tap!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, reasonable price and so far most friendly staff Ive ever encounter since I got here in Arizona. Keep it up.."}
{"text":"Pizza here is ok. They barely put any sauce on my pizza. I asked for extra jalapeños and got extra pineapples that tasted funny. Pizza is average and second time I've gone there and the pizza seems to need to be cooked longer. Compared to other places like this by my old work it doesn't compare."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and the service is top notch! It nice to come to a restaurant were the people actually serve you with a smile!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, really fresh ingredients. Make it the way I wanted it. The side salad was fresh and mixed very well. I had a little ranch on every bite."}
{"text":"How can you not get this place five stars? The staff are awesome. We've eaten there a bunch since it opened. And the guys there are always smiling happy and keep their cool. That's not to say that your meal isn't made quickly and with quality. We've had excellent meals every time we've been there. And the pizzas come out hot, fresh and fast! The last two times we've gone it has been slammed for late-night dinners. But these guys kept focused and got everyone in and out in such a fast way it was crazy --we took our order out and ate it at home and it was still hot, fresh, delicious--- unlimited toppings what could be more amazing @ a pizza place!?!"}
{"text":"This is good pizza.  I can't honestly say that it stands out from the other build-your-own pizza joints springing up on every corner.  But if you like any of the other similar franchises, you'll like this one.  It's not a bad thing to have more quality pizza available from more sources.   I scanned the suggested pizzas on their menu board, but I ultimately decided to fashion my own.  I chose pepperoni, bacon, Italian sausage, black olives, garlic, red onion, tomato, rosemary, and oregano.  All of the toppings were generously apportioned and of good quality."}
{"text":"Just had a gluten free, cheese-less pizza and it was perfect!! Delicious crust, ingredients were bursting (tomatoes, mushroom, olives, spinach) with flavor and the added spices were a great suggestion. Plus, they weren't annoyed with my order rather super friendly and helpful!!"}
{"text":"Sorry MOD, your management is poor, your lines don't move. I've stopped by twice in the last few weeks and BOTH times, the line JUST DOESN'T MOVE...and under your MOD pizza sign it reads super fast...I call bull. SLOW SLOW SLOW. Your pizza makers appear to have no clue what they are doing...reading the ingrediants from from the board.  You are not ready for Arcadia. Clean up your act. Get a manager who knows how to run a fast food restaurant.  Too many excellent pizza places to even bother stopping here."}
{"text":"Pizza is fantastic and has to have one of the most fun group of employees I've ever been to. Price is very reasonable for the great quality and it doesn't get any fresher than this."}
{"text":"Three words: gluten free pizza!! I've frequented mod over the past year, and it's the perfect choice if you're looking for a quick meal that offers extremely consistent quality. I make my own pie combo and often switch up ingredients, and I've never been disappointed. Great value for 2 people to share, with a slice or two for leftovers. This is my go-to spot in a pinch."}
{"text":"MOD serves delicious pizza at an affordable price. My husband and I each order their personal-sized pizzas and they are great portions! Plus, the staff here is always friendly!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, clean place,happy employees.  I like their pizza and customer service.  I will definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great food and the entire staff is outstanding and super friendly.  I highly recommend the #9 bbq chicken pizza...so yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  Flat Amazing.  This stuff was sooooooo good.  Introduced by friends when discussing the facts of finding a good pizza place.  Really, a \"Subway\" style pizza bar that doesn't charge extra for every little thing you want.  \"This must be too good to be true.\"  Absolutely not!  It was exactly as explained.  High quality ingredients, great service, great food, at one low cost.  Anyone giving less than 5 stars must not enjoy, quality, service and good food.  We are now regulars ;) YUMMMY!"}
{"text":"Ahhhhmazing pizza!! We had the Maddy, and a pizza with garlic, pepperoni, mushrooms, and black olives, and garlic sticks. Everything came out quickly and the pizza and garlic sticks were so good! The marionberry lemonade was fantastic as well. Place was busy, but that's expected for a Friday night. Staff was friendly and efficient. We will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"First time eating here today and was not disappointed, the pizza was delish! The staff was friendly and helpful along with cheerful. Will be going back again! The lemonade was also a delish!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I go here all the time and it's great! You get to choose youre size of pizza and any toppings you want and they make it right in front of you. Every time I've been in everyone has been nice. They only down side is that they close at 9 but other than that they're great!:)"}
{"text":"Excellent service, competitive price! MOD Pizza, the best pizza which got the praise from me and my friends.  Considering the attire and ambience, it is good for families with kids and groups."}
{"text":"This place is really good. It isn't super cheap but you get to choose your own adventure as you navigate this culinary challenge.   My first time in should serve as a cautionary tale... I got too bold, but I learned my lesson on the second time around and build an awesome pizza."}
{"text":"Great crust and super friendly employees delivering an outstanding customer experience."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Very reasonable prices.  Came during lunch and they were very good at getting order out fast."}
{"text":"Our new favorite place! The pizza is so good and the staff is friendly and efficient.  Great food,  great service  -  we will be eating there a lot!  :)"}
{"text":"I went into mod and worked with a fantastic young man on the line. He was very courteous and professional. However there was a lady named Heather who was extremely unprofessional. She was cussing in front of customers and was ignoring employees. He was fantastic however because of her I had to give a bad review."}
{"text":"Good peppy environment, Pizza is okay. Seems like they skimp on quality of the ingreadents, especially noticeable with the sasuage. Location is convenient prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is great! They have a two options for sizes and prices are just right. They selections of ingredients tasted fresh, the sauce was tasty, and I even had the option for how long I wanted to cook my pizza. After the pie comes out they have finishers that you can add on.  The customer service was great, we came in Friday night about 10:30 and we were the first ones in before a late night rush hit. Very friendly staff.  They have some tasty craft beers on tap and wine if you desire. Also, shakes and root beer floats are available. I will try out the salads next time too. Definitely a great option to choose from of the three pizza on demand restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Good food but I can count at least 6 ants on the wall at the moment. Some are on our table."}
{"text":"I am fan and I will be back. This pizza joint exceeded expectations. I ordered an 11\" build your own pizza and created a Hawaiian pizza with extra pineapple. It was delicious! I like the fact that they sell beer and shakes as well. The place was packed with the line practically out the door. The one thing that disappointed was the lack of friendliness from the employees, wasn't met by a single smile. They seemed overwhelmed and grumpy. Other than that, they offer quality ingredients and great tasting food at a fair price that's for sure."}
{"text":"Great concept, but woefully understaffed for lunch. Pizzas needed to be remade as they were allowed to burn, prepped pizzas weren't put in the oven in a timely fashion, etc.... Furthermore, most of the tables weren't bused, leaving the customer to clean up after prior patrons. This place will soon be out of business if this continues..."}
{"text":"Emily and Conrad made a great pizza for me. They where very friendly. They helped me make the perfect pizza. They have two beers on tap and $2 pbrs and an assortment of bottled beer."}
{"text":"Very good pizza combined with fresh ingredients. Fast and good service. Recommend if you want a cheap but good quality pizza and salad with fresh ingredients"}
{"text":"Placed order through Yelp, but yelp never picked up my order. So called store and Cody was person to help me with problem. He was very professional and took care of it for me. Just from this call alone I will be giving them my business and praise. Can not Thank Cody enough for helping me out. Thank you again."}
{"text":"Best service I've ever had at any fast food joint I've been to... the manager and crew are sooo nice"}
{"text":"After eating my pizza I had to come back and give an actual review. I highly recommend MOD Pizza. They r kind quick and efficient. The Pizza crust was cooked perfectly and the red sauce is amazing. I love that I can add as many toppings as I want and be creative. I am going to tell everyone about this place and be back myself!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great pizza. Friendly staff. Always generous with their toppings. No too bad on price. Milk shakes good/"}
{"text":"Love! Love! Love!!! From there support of veterans to the friendly service!!! Truly the chic fil a and chipotle for PIZZA!!!!  Lots of fresh toppings to choose from! The lemonade is awesome sauce!!!! Did I mention the friendly service!!!!! ..... try it! And try it again and again and then one more time just to be sure!!!!"}
{"text":"I love walking into this place! I mean seriously anyone who gives this place less than 5 stars is a fool! Every one here is super friendly and the pizza is always cooked to perfection. If you don't like your pizza you picked the ingredients so it is your fault LOL!! Anyways this place is my favorite spot for my weekly cheat meals and will forever continue to be!!"}
{"text":"Awesome friendly service .... Pizza was good, and I happen to be a huge fan of Devils Ale which they have on tap! I'm really hoping they plan on putting some flat screens on the walls. I'd love to go there and tip a few back while watching a game."}
{"text":"I think it only fair to lay out some background information before writing this review:  First, I don't get the concept of \"thin crust\" pizzas and I never will.  I wasn't impressed with them when Dominoes came up with the concept some 30 years ago and I'm still not.  Back in New York, a thin-crust pizza wasn't firm like a cracker and, thus, didn't hold up firmly when you put things on it.  It was doughy.  I admit to being a carboholic and the thicker the crust, the better (Go Sicilian!).  I call thin crust pizza \"Jewish Pizza\", because it reminds me of putting toppings on top of a piece of matzoh (except matzoh's a bit thicker and doesn't fall apart like ashes if you grab it too hard).  MOD Pizza's concept is simple:  come in and pick one of their pre-selected topping pizzas or make your own.  In that respect, not too different from Papa Murphy's.  The resemblance ends there.  Whereas my partner's white sauce pizza had lots of sauce on it; the guy making mine decided to \"spread\" the sauce around with the ladle, thus making it thin (i.e., non existent).  My fault:  I could have said something.  Likewise, the woman making my friend's pizza was generous with toppings; my guy acted like they were making him pay for every topping he sprinkled on my pizza.  The pizza is good; especially if you're a fan of the as-solid-as-air crust of thin pizzas.  Ambiance is another matter.  There's both indoor and outdoor seating in this strip mall.  Like many such outdoor locales in Phoenix, this one adjoins a parking lot with a busy street across the way.  Since the weather was beautiful today, we decided to sit outdoors; especially as music was playing loudly inside.  Unfortunately, whether they can't or don't want to, the music cannot be shut off outside and it's not played softly.  To me, music is very subjective, just like art; and if you're listening to something you don't like, it doesn't enhance the meal, it ruins it.  Take a guess by my tone which category I fall into!  Finally, I have to say, that I'm NOT a cheap person; I'm frugal.  A cheap person won't part with his/her money unless upon pain of death; a frugal person isn't loose with his/her money either, but has no problem paying for something when it's worth it.  I'm not arrogant or idiotic enough to believe that labor costs and convenience shouldn't be built into a price.  $7.49 + tax for a personal pizza on crispy loose leaf paper is not a bad deal.  But for $2.99, I can go to Safeway, get a thicker pizza, spend money on toppings and come out paying less and actually enjoy it ... as a snack.  There is nothing unreasonable about this place's prices or the concept.  I just don't see anything to brag or be excited about.  Add to that the occasional verbal assault by the homeless asking for money while you dine outside and the experience is more than forgettable ... I hope."}
{"text":"I was very excited to finally see a decent pizza place in this area!  The \"design your own\" pizza craze is hot in Phoenix and this chain, although being the third entry in the field, are gonna make a race of it.  You get an 11 inch pizza for only $7.47 with as many or few toppings of your choice for one low price!  Or, if you prefer just a cheese pizza, ask for the \"maddy\" for only $5.97.  They even have a \"mini\" size for those with smaller appetites.  After selecting the size of your crust (and yes, they do have gluten-free available), you have your option of several toppings, including a rich tomato sauce, BBQ, and others.  As much as I wanted to stay traditional, the pesto sauce was calling my name (and I highly recommend it).  Your choice of toppings are extensive, and of high quality from the fresh meat to the colorful and vibrant vegetables.  Even the fresh herbs appeared to be freshly chopped.  In addition to the normal toppings, this place has a few I have not see elsewhere, like Asiago cheese, pepperoncini, fresh chopped rosemary and even a balsamic fig glaze to top it off.  The pizzas are cooked in a brick oven (not a conveyor belt like one of the other places) and come out fresh, hot and crisp in just a couple of minutes.  I made short work of the my Pesto and Veggie pizza, and will be back to expand my creativity and satisfy my hunger very soon....  They also have \"design your own\" salads, garlic strips, and for desserts, cinnamon strips and sweet tarts.  Although you may have to skip the dessert if you decide to indulge yourself with one of their very tasty milkshakes.  One more thing before I go.  I have to mention the to-go boxes that are actually two separate pieces, which I found a bit odd at first, until I realized it was a clever and convenient way to share (if you can).  P.S. Extra kudos for having Angry Orchard Cider!"}
{"text":"Terrible pizza, terrible salad. This has to be one of the worst pizza places around. The crust was flavorless cardboard, sauce was a dull tomato paste, salad was something I could have bought in a bag at Harris Teeter.  I've had frozen pizza that was better. There is more attention paid to saying hello and goodbye to the patrons than the food prep. Friendly staff but lousy food."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and atmosphere.  Love the customer focus!"}
{"text":"I like the variety that you can create here, but I feel like they are always a little skimpy on the toppings. We also had two out of three pizzas made incorrectly at the Metrocenter location. I feel like the staff is just rushing the pizzas through so it gives it too much of a \"fast food\" feeling. I'd take the wait for a \"build your own\" at the Parlor any day, or the Fired Pie by my office. I do credit Mod for being super affordable."}
{"text":"The pizza was just ok.  It's all prepped ahead of time, who knows how long and the crust looks like something you buy in the italian aisle of the grocery story to let your kids have fun making their own pizza.  But the service and unorganized assembly line was unacceptable.  I ordered a pizza listed on the wall.  They are supposed to know what goes on their pizzas not me.  So I say I want an XYZ, whatever it was.  And the first person has to look at the wall and see what goes on it.  Then I get passed to person number 2, the paper says what I want, he asks me what it is, ME.  I don't know you work here.  So then we both look at the wall and see what goes on it.  Repeat again for assembly line person number 3.  By person number 4 I decide, ok I'm tired of this crap, I'm just gonna tell them what I want on it.  Person 4 goes by fine.  Now I get to person 5.  Same thing starts to happen so I just say, sun dried tomatoes and I think we're done because I don't want anything else on my pizza.  He says \"What?\"  I say sun dried tomatoes, they are literally right in front of him and right in front of me.  He says what again.  So I say sun dried tomatoes and point.  And this sets off an uproar, \"DON'T PUT YOUR HAND OVER THE GLASS SIR\"  I swear someone was going to take me down for pointing.  If I didn't have my kids with me...  Anyhow, ok pizza, 3 stars, dumb process with kids that can't remember what they sell executing it -1."}
{"text":"This place rocks!! Think of a barista for your pizza! You can make it however you want and if you screw it up by being too adventurous with toppings they'll remake it for free!! The general manager is excellent.  He's involved with his crew and his guests and was so personable and sincere that we loved our pizzas!! And we did! Deeeelish and excellent service. Can't ask for more. Only criticism which is for corporate: please bring back ricotta !!!"}
{"text":"This pizza is AMAZING and glad its in the Steele Creek area! So glad to have a place that offers very fresh topping for a great price. The staff was great and will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"We come here for lunch and it's always very good.  They have a gazillion toppings to choose and you can get it as a salad.   I would give a 5th star if the regular iced tea were better- apparently it's organic and it seems to get rancid.  They always offer to make more.  I love the music there!"}
{"text":"MOD is my new go to place for Pizza. I am originally from up north so the Pizza places here in Charlotte can't compare, but MOD's is now my Fav! It is a very artsy warehouse environment. The staff is very friendly as well. There are numerous items on the menu to choose from and you get to build your own pizza without paying all the extra $$$ for toppings....Love the concept, and the pizza is Delish as well!!! I usually get the Lucy Sunshine (Mozzarella, Parmesan, Artichokes, Garlic, dollops of MOD red sauce)  and then I build on from there by adding (Onion, Black Olives, Feta, Tomatoes, Roasted red peppers, and Drizzled pesto).....YUM!!!! P.S. They have a pretty good beer selection as well."}
{"text":"Really good pizza for a cheap price!!! Super friendly staff and they also play some cool jams love this place!"}
{"text":"I give mod pizza 5 stars!the atmosphere when you walk in is pleasant and welcoming.the workers there are very nice and have great customer service!there fast and live up to  the name MOD(made on demand). They have so many varieties to choose from for toppings for your \" pizza! and the pizza always comes out Hot and fresh! It's really cool how the pizza is made in an earth stove and its visible so you can see your pizza go in and come right out! anyways  MOD pizza is the best pizza spot there is in chandler and Ahwatukee area!"}
{"text":"Love there pizza, hate the oven taste though on the bottom of the crust. Atmosphere is cool."}
{"text":"MOD is a good choice for decent quality food prepared quickly. The staff was friendly & happy to explain all options for building your pie which takes only a few minutes to bake. Overall, MOD is worthy of a regular spot in your fast food rotation."}
{"text":"Great food and great people at this location. If you are daring ask for a Mel special, this girl can make a pizza!!!!!"}
{"text":"My first time here. Pizza was quick and delicious! I had Sophie and it was great. I can't wait to come back and try others."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and I really like the service, the atmosphere and the whole concept.  My only warning to people who are going that like sauce on your pizza, ask for extra sauce and don't be shy about asking for two extra ladles full, otherwise they spread it so thin that they might as well not put any on.  But that's a small criticism that is easily fixed by just asking for more.  The price is terrific as well. Good place."}
{"text":"Was there a few weeks back, I ordered the bbq chicken pizza, I went to great pains to explain that I didn't want the gorgonzola cheese, I don't like it.  I was assured it wouldn't be there.  Cashier was new, made some mistakes, forgot to get the beer I had ordered, forgot to charge for the wine, but he was nice enough.   Anyway, I get my pizza, and it is loaded with gorgonzola cheese.  You had one thing requested of you and you screwed it up.  I tried it, as I figured it was what I ordered and it was awful, because I don't like that cheese.  Plenty of other similar franchises or places that make real pizza around.  Not coming back."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have had in years! Everyone working is friendly and always having a smiling face when I come in. Just tried the new mega and it has the best crust! Kind of reminds me of a Chicago style! Thanks Gary Keri and Abi!"}
{"text":"I get the mini and load it up with grilled chicken, mushrooms, olives, artichoke hearts, sun dried tomatoes, mozzarella and feta cheese and top it all off with pesto sauce. It's DELICIOUS. For less than $5.  Great deal."}
{"text":"Totally enjoy this place every time I come. My personal favorite is the Jasper and the cream soda is always great. Staff is is 5 star. Always upbeat and friendly."}
{"text":"Brought the family in for a quick bite after a performance by 6 year old son. He was super excited customizing his own Pizza, but thanks to a young blonde employee, who couldn't get past the fact that a 6 year old child can change his mind about what he wants, ruined the experience for us. Instead of following and buying into the MoDpizza philosophy of fast custom Pizza,  she had the audacity of bringing attitude and rudeness to the table rather than a smile and understanding.    Coming from a bussiness  background,  I can't imagine this is something the owners of the establishment  are encoyraging. Children are allowed to cry, throw tantrums and  change their minds, employees that can't accommodate the above have no bussiness  working the front line of MoDpizza   I did bring this to the attention of the manager, but the owner of the establishment  has the right to know , how the customers feel.   I do enjoy dining at Modpizza and wanted to make recommendations to my fellow colleagues in the neighborhood but I have my reservations now."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now and I am always satisfied. Great pizza and friendly staff! The last time I came in it was very busy and I had to wait awhile for my pizza, but the staff gave me a free drink while I waited! Recently I called in an order for pick up, which was unfortunately forgotten. I didn't mind waiting but the staff gave me my pie on the house anyways. I will always recommend this place not only for the great pizza but also the amazing way they treat their customers. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I'm madly in love with this place. I make my own version of a margarita and I'm in heaven. Their tea is fantastic. It has easily become my favorite place to grab a bite. You get so much food and it is soooo good. Please try it out. You get to pick out and tell the employee EXACTLY how you want your pizza. And yes, I am that picky."}
{"text":"Forget what you know about ordering pizza, because you won't need any of that. Traditional pizza pricing has been thrown out the window, with any combination of toppings will cost you the same. Although approaching the counter can seem a daunting experience, the staff (especially at this location) will be happy to help guide you. You can be certain that no matter what, your toppings will be correct and they will be on your pizza exactly the way you want them. The service is exceptionally quick as well.  Mod is a refreshing take on pizza places. I got a Mod with: red sauce, mozzarella, spinach, sundried tomato, arugula, bacon, mushrooms, artichokes, and a pesto drizzle. All for the same price as the base Mod-sized pizza.   The decor is post-naughties, very modern. The music is good.   The only concern that I have about Mod Pizza is that there won't be one when I go back home to Tampa.   I am glad that I decided to stop in for some dinner."}
{"text":"Here we are, my mom and I, having an adventure in Scottsdale Arizona. Can't even begin to write everything, but it all started with listing my drivers license and not being able to board our plane to go home. Unless.............. Anyway, beings that we're somewhat \"stranded\" here, we're making the most of it. One bright and shining light was finding  MOD PIZZA! The young man behind the counter was VERY courteous even though it was obvious that they were getting ready to start cleaning up so that they could close on time. He was very gracious, did not make me feel rushed, instead was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Now, the Pizza? Oh please, it was the epitome of awesomeness!  I ate almost the whole pizza! Must hit the gym when I get home because I KNOW,  I will be up, eating whatever's left about 1:00 in the morning! Take my word for it! You will most definitely become an instant fan of this pizzeria! Thanks to those that work behind the scenes!"}
{"text":"MOD is a pretty good pizza joint from what I can tell from my visit. The place was nice, I had no problems ordering, and the wait wasn't bad. I appreciate the selection of toppings along with the prices for the pizzas. I feel good for what I had paid to get mine. The pizza itself was good. It wasn't the best I had, but for the price?"}
{"text":"Ate here a few days ago and wasn't all that impressed. One of the staff got an attitude with me when I asked about their gluten free crust which is odd because that's one of their advertising points. If you're looking for good pizza in the area, there are better options."}
{"text":"The service at this MOD was amazing and I'll definitely be back! They were super friendly and nice! Gary was so patient with helping me and my boyfriend with what we want on our pizza. The pizza itself was great as well!"}
{"text":"Grand opening they gave away 50 free pizzas and served them all within an hour! Incredible! Amazing pizza, salads & salad pizza!! Every vegetable you can think of on top am asiago cheese crust. Delicious. Highly recommend. Definite repeat customer :)"}
{"text":"I fell in pizza heaven when I came here. The vegan/dairy free cheese is so tasty. I had to cut cheese out my diet and thought I would never get to eat pizza with cheese again. I love all the options from the different sauces and toppings. The balsamic fig glaze is so good I want to buy some for at home.  They have really good lemonade and tea. It's cool that they have beer and wine. Very clean. Very friendly. Always amazing. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Good pizza for anyone and everyone. My vegan mom can get salad and dairy free pizza. Everything on the menu is pretty Gucci. You get to choose your type of pizza with toppings and cheese. They also have good cinnamon sticks. I recommend eating here for pizza because it's really fast and easy. It's basically like subway but with pizza!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I'd rather have a thick crust but still amazing considering you get your pizza exactly as you want it. Skip the garlic strips - no flavor and just dough with some garlic on it. Go super hungry and you can eat a whole MOD, otherwise you can expect to take some home for leftovers! Try the Pesto sauce on the side!"}
{"text":"This is the ultimate pizza place. All employees are personable and helpful. I come here on break for my work all the time and I've never been disappointed. If anybody has a problem with the service here they're probably in the wrong themselves."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza and very quick too! First visit and we will be back for sure...love the local beer touch!"}
{"text":"MOD is located right near Pie 5. They essentially have the same concept, but Pie 5 wins it in my view.   MOD has plentiful and creative toppings. The staff is also plentiful and nice (albeit disquietingly loud -- they shout hello and goodbye to patrons in unison). There's lots s of seating in a good looking restaurant.   Where MOD falls to Pie 5 is in the crust., which is more of a traditional pizza crust whereas The MOD crust is more like a giant tasteless cracker. The pizza is fast because the crust is thinner. Or it's supposed to be. My experience with Pie 5 is that they're as fast, if not faster. But they do theirs on a conveyor through an oven as opposed to the more traditional oven at MOD."}
{"text":"Wonderful pizza and great concept! The fairly priced flat-rate price for a decent sized personal pizza (I believe 11 inch) where you can add as many toppings as you want from a large variety is fantastic. The staff were all friendly, the pizza is fired pretty fast and the ingredients are fresh. There were adults and kids of all ages that seemed to be enjoying the smaller sizes too. We'll definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Great new location at Elliot and the 101 in Tempe! Mod pizza is awesome. Make your pizza or salad off the menu or create your own. Unlimited toppings at one low price. Love this place, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. They Rushed to order over the phone. They Rushed to pay and get out. Decided to look through my carry out order. Missing salad dressing and salads looked horrible. They added toppings that were supposed to be included. No utensils. Salad terrible. Pizza ok. Never again."}
{"text":"First time experience was not good.  Understanding that it's wood fired pizza but I'm pretty sure ours was burnt. Sauces seemed tasteless and toppings were used sparingly.  We ordered two different Mods and and both were a disappointment.  Kinda reminded me of cheese on a saltine cracker."}
{"text":"Great pizza and good prices. We usually order out but the restaurant atmosphere looks fun even if we decide to dine in. Love the fresh toppings."}
{"text":"Caters to people with Dairy allergies but the only option is gluten free crust with BBQ sauce as all other sauces have cheese in them? TO MELLOW MUSHROOM!"}
{"text":"What a great find!  I was looking for a new place to grab a quick pizza and found MOD.  I had seen the storefront yet did not understand what the letters referred to until reading a bit more on YELP. Order placing was simple and quick.  I ordered a salad first and it was great.  By the time I ordered my 11 inch pizza and paid for my items, the pizza was coming out of the oven.  Perfect timing and friendly, knowledgeable staff as well.  I will be returning!  Thank you for being in Chandler."}
{"text":"Great service, greeted on the way in and said goodbye on the way out. Food was great. My 12 year said it was the best pizza he has ever had. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"Was in there yesterday evening and it was extremely busy. The service was awesome April one of the managers was very nice and attentive. Ask for a specialty pizza and she popped it out right away. It was delicious. Glad we have a location closer to us. Will be coming back more often. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great service!  All the stuff is always smiling, and helpful. Their toppings are very fresh and plentiful Absolutely love their thin crust. This is a fun and quick place to go with the family."}
{"text":"This place is great! You basically pay for a small, medium, or large pizza/salad and then all the toppings are included. It's set up like a Subway or Chipotle where your food is built as you go down the line then put into a fire oven. There is only one type of crust which is a hand tossed (not thick).  I highly recommend the Dillon James pizza adding black olives and onions."}
{"text":"Had to leave before I could order. Waited in line for 30 minutes and didn't move.  Had I stayed, guarantee it would have been 30 minutes longer.  Maybe if they served drinks while in line, it would help the wait time. Not sure how the food is. Hesitant to go back."}
{"text":"Great little place.  Plenty of seating and this location seems relatively new as it's very clean.  Service was very friendly and the group of employees say goodbye as you leave which is a nice touch for a chain.    It's an assembly line type place and it moved quickly.  Choose whether you want pizza, salad or both then add toppings as you go.  Takes about 5 minutes for the pizza to cook in the open 'brick style' oven.  Pizza is very thin crust.  I've lived in the NY/NJ area before and this is the type of pizza they'd typically serve at a restaurant as a lunch or as an app for the table. I only say this b/c many people up there are very strict and proud of their pizza and as chains go, this place stacks up very well.  Chain speeds, consistency, and expectations but you can also get a local beer on tap - pretty good stuff in my book."}
{"text":"Words cannot express how happy I am this place finally made its way to Arizona. I am originally from WA and would go here all the time! Garlic knots, salads and pizza are all amazing!! Favorite is the BBQ chicken"}
{"text":"Normally come here every now and again usually good kinda got or miss bit today I walk in place my order and proceed to get my drink. Dispense my root beer usually fairly carbonated there was none then try the coke same ask the bus boy if they are supposed to have carbonation  trying to hint at changing it if there isn't a problem with the machine. Takes his sweet time doing it then complains under his breath about it and called me stupid to another employee as I was behind him and heard him. Wow great service used to be u would get fired for that stuff weird how times have changed."}
{"text":"Great pizza. I've been to a few other make-your-own pizza places, but they were much more restrictive, had a higher cost, and it's hard to compare anything to the great service there.   I've only been once so I can't speak just now to the consistency. I'll update after a few more visits.   Our food came out very quickly. Ordering was a little difficult with so many choices. For first timers I would suggest choosing one of their pizza options then add toppings that you enjoy."}
{"text":"The quality of the pizza is good, and the concept is great, but the employees are awful. Manager was yelling at one of the employees in front of customers, the girl making our pizza walked away for a few minutes to do something else mid way through making it, forgot to put cheese on the pizza, and then I had to ask them to put it in the oven after it sat there a few more minutes. It took about 15 minutes to get in and out of there in total due to their incompetence"}
{"text":"MOD is my go-to for all things pizza! As a low-CARB guy, they bend over backwards to meet my challenging requests. Tim and Chris always remember my order and make a BOMB low-carb pizza! I call it the BUCKET PIZZA! Just be sure they know how to cook it...for sure it takes more time than a regular pizza.   If you LCHF, this place is for you!"}
{"text":"Love MOD. Great Pizza, Great staff, Great management.  Love that it's unlimited toppings. The lemonaids are soooo good. Especially the berry one. So is the specialty tea.   My wish is that you'd offer a larger to go cup.  Like 32oz!!!!!"}
{"text":"I sent an online order in for pickup and 20 min later I arrived to find that my order hadn't been started. If the place was busy, I would have understood, but no customers  were there. I had to wait 10 min for them to finish. And the restaurant motto is \"fast\". I had their monthly special pizza.... One of the worst pizza's I've ever had. And the shake had \"crunchies\" in it that took up 25% of the shake making it hard to consume the shake. This place should close in 2-3 months"}
{"text":"I had been going here for the gluten free pizza for a month or so now...one of the only places that my family and I can actually go out and enjoy since I have a sensitivity to dairy and gluten. However, unfortunately, I was very upset when traveling all the way from Tempe with family in tow, only to find a simple note posted on the door explaining they were out of gluten free pizza. You would  of thought after making it a staple in their menu, that they wouldn't run out.... Very disappointed. I wish I could give more stars because their pizza tastes wonderful, but I now feel that making the trip without calling first is a bit of a hassle."}
{"text":"The pizza is out of this world and the service is too. A huge thank you to Dillon for coming in clutch with the sauce recommendations"}
{"text":"Ate here last night. Loved that you can do as many toppings as you want for one price. The mini size pizzas were perfect for the kids. Kids had super thick shakes that must have been delicious because they were devoured enthusiastically. Went with a large group and everyone seemed happy with their pizza. Super fast too.  I reserve a star because for the fast, thin crust pizza, Pizza Brutta will always have my heart. That said, it's not always convenient to where I live so Mod will be a nice alternative."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time today.  We ordered an 11\" pizza and they put about 1/2 oz of sausage and a tablespoon or so of cheese.  While the flavors were ok it with the skimp it was mostly crust.  Also the salad greens were wilted and unappealing so a pass on the salad.  Follow up:   Great response from MOD Pizza and we will give them another try."}
{"text":"Love their pizzas! The Olivia pizza with pesto is amazing. The Balsalmic Fig glaze on top is to die for! Atmosphere is fun but sometimes the employees can be a little short while trying to rush you thru the line. I've also had the bottom of my pizza a little too well done a couple of times. Still loved it though and didn't make me hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"Delicious and a great price. $7 for an 11 inch pizza with unlimited toppings. Bread was great and toppings were fresh. Loved it"}
{"text":"Always wanted to try the location in Phoenix so I was stoked when they opened one closer to home! Such a great place. The pizzas are awesome and so is the staff. Highly suggest coming."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times (and another one somewhere else, (can't remember location)), and they're always satisfying each time. I've also been to other create your own shops as well, and most are generally the same, but for some reason MOD is still my favorite. I've read reviews on create your own pizza restaurants and how people are complaining about the crust. I mean, you pay a base price (ok price, not the cheapest route) and get to literally put whatever the heck you want on them, not everything is gonna be 5 star, people. The size of the pizza is perfect for one (well, me anyways) person. Every time I go, I end up putting on all the meats, including that forbidden anchovies, which they have to pull out the container and blow the dust off since I seem to be the only one who gets it. You can't get that at non create your own shops (also basil pesto and white sauce is better than red by itself). Usually with places like this, I'm not expecting THE BEST tasting food, but it's creative and you get to make it like the way you want. I don't care if its thin \"cracker crust\", it has everything I want for a dream pizza and that's all that matters. Really don't see how people can hate these places because it doesn't cater to all their perfect pizza needs. There's better pizza shops out there, no doubt, but unlimited toppings rule"}
{"text":"Wow, had an amazing lunch here with the hubs.  The pizza is/was spectacular, loved the crust and made it as a build your own, rather than one of their many combinations that they offer.  The service was above and beyond.  The employees each were helpful and very nice.  We'd go back in a flash even though it's a bit of a drive."}
{"text":"Great family  restaurant.  Priced well, food is great.  Small pizzas and you pick what goes on it. Staff is well trained.  Great plaza, they sit beside Athleticuts. We got hair cuts then cup cakes from bunt.  Fun outing."}
{"text":"My son and I love coming here. I get the pizza with vegan cheese and my son loads up on meat. Cindy is very helpful."}
{"text":"This was my first time to MOD pizza.  Got the make your own and I was very surprised on how good the pizza was!   I have been to fresh made pizza restaurants like this and this was fairly cheap, easy to order and fast.   Will absolutely return!"}
{"text":"Best place . Good price. Clean. Nice staff. Pizza is yummy. Better than pie-ology. Highly recommended. Price is worth it."}
{"text":"Food was good value for the price -- would give that a 4.5. But we were there Sunday afternoon and heavy metal was being blasted over the sound system. Music more appropriate for a Saturday night dive. We asked that it be changed. If it was, it wasn't an improvement.   Why should we go back?"}
{"text":"You really can't beat it for the price and fast service - and the pizza is pretty tasty. The price is the same no matter how many toppings you want (the selection of toppings is great) and the different sizes they offer are just right. I have to admit I was a little leery when I saw the prefab crusts, but it was actually pretty good - especially if you like thin crust. I really hope it sticks around because it's the kind of place that has so much variety, you really will never get bored.  If you're a beer drinker, they offer pitchers and are currently running a happy hour special. The staff is friendly and very patient as people try to decide what toppings they want.  Give it a try, I think you'll like it."}
{"text":"Grand opening was yesterday!  Made on demand pizzas is the concept here. Same price for one topping or unlimited toppings. They make it up fresh in front of you and pop the za in their ovens for a quick baking.   Pizza not your thing??  Well, MOD does build-your-own salads, but customers can also order salads off a menu, like the pizzas. The restaurant sells garlic strips and cinnamon strips. There are shakes too if you have a sweet tooth.   First time I have seen wine on tap and it tasted just fine!  Couple of New Glarus beers on tap, couple local bottles beers.  Fountain or bottled sofas plus 2 teas and 2 lemonades.   Super friendly and smiley workers. I think they are going to do fine in this location"}
{"text":"We ordered online and both got salads. I was not impressed with the salads for the price or the service. My friend didn't get what she ordered at all. The person working there was flippant and didn't offer us a bag, napkins, utensils, or dressing. I wouldn't go back there for the salads or the service."}
{"text":"We had a good time here! We stopped in for dinner not really knowing what to expect. All the toppings you want are included in the price. They have a variety of sauces and toppings, plus a selection of suggested pizzas if you are indecisive like me. We ordered 4 pizzas (2 individual for adults, two mini for the kids) which was enough for the 4 of us. If you're not super hungry, two people may be able to share one, but I'd get a pizza per person for a meal. They made a mistake on the kids pizzas and left off a topping, so they ended up offering to make two new ones and let us keep the wrong ones. They were very apologetic and quick to correct a mistake. They also had a couple local beers on tap which was nice since we are new to the area and got to try something new. Overall, it was an excellent experience and we will return again soon!"}
{"text":"Pizza heaven.  It's like Chipotle, but for pizza, and you can add all the extras you want with no extra charge.  The only downside is they only have one type of crust, and it isn't the best.  But for a quick flavorful pizza fix, this is the place.  They have my all time fav pizza topping - artichokes- which can be hard to find otherwise.  LOVE!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and I would say compared to Fired Pie, this place is simply average.  All the times I have been here the place is empty-perhaps its busier at lunch or maybe everyone is at Fired or Pielogy, which are both located 5 to 10 minutes away.  The problem I have with the pizzas I have ordered is that the middle tends to get a bit soggy and the cheese there does not get completely cooked.  The toppings were fine.  Again, not a bad pizza, but for my taste, Fired and Pielogy pies taste better."}
{"text":"The pizzas are always perfect!!! No matter what you want on it or in my case how much extra you want on it, they always do it with a smile and then it is baked to perfection. A special thanks to new manager Mel, for being so cheerful, remembering my name and even helping me out to the car with my pizza. Great job guys."}
{"text":"I came in a was just about to order when I noticed something pretty disgusting that I think needs to be changed. I am a vegan, but I still think if I wasn't I'd be grossed out. The person used the same gloves and picked up the sausage put it on a person's pizza, then used the same hand to pick up the corn. That person now has contaminated the corn, that I was planning to put on my pizza. I think for anyone with allergies or different lifestyles (Kosher, Vegetarian, Vegan etc. )will find this disturbing. If you aren't going to use tongs, then at least use one hand for the meat, and one hand for the veggies. Really disappointed!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Being able to put whatever toppings we wanted on our individual pizzas was great! Especially enjoyed the roasted garlic :)"}
{"text":"One personal sized pizza, given that it's paper thin, is about the equivalent of one piece of Papa John's pizza. Seriously, I could've easily eaten three of their personal size pizzas. So the personal pizza is fine for a kid, perhaps, but certainly not an adult. But beyond that, their pizza just wasn't very good. I wouldn't even put their pizza on par with store-bought pizza, seriously."}
{"text":"The Pros: Very tasty pizza for a great price. Nice crispy, thin crust. They also had a small but quality beer selection. The staff was very friendly.  The Cons: There were about 6 people in front of us and we waited in line for almost 20 minutes to order our pizza.  Just as we got to the front of the line, a couple additional employees came out and things seemed to speed up after that.   I wanted to give MOD a higher rating and if it weren't for the wait and the slow staff, I would. The food and the price were both good enough that we'll give MOD another try. I hope the super-slow guy making pizza when we got there was the exception and not the rule!"}
{"text":"Super quick! The place is really clean and the staff is friendly. We got out pizza in about 7 minutes (at most.) the lady manager was so nice when we were checking out she asked if we would want to try their dessert \" on the house.\" For sure recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is great! We were greeted instantly when we walked in, the service/staff were amazing! The pizza was so good! Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing! Staff yelled \"Yellow, that's right just like the color!\" as a greeting and I couldn't stop smiling after a greeting like that! Great pizza and awesome atmosphere!"}
{"text":"It's a pizza lovers dream! The staff here is extremely helpful and nice. The pizza is delicious depending on the topping you choose, because you get to create your master pizza from scratch! Love this place and definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Favorite pizza place in the valley. I love to get two different types of pizza on each half of a Mod. The beer is also local and their caramelized pear iced tea is out of this world. Fresh and delicious ingredients paired with excellent customer service = me eating here at least once a week."}
{"text":"I was out in Gilbert and decided to give MOD Pizza a try.  Unfortunately,  I came away with a negative view of the place.  I was very  disappointed with the pizza here.  The concept is the same as Fired Pie but the execution fell short.    First, I am shocked that no other reviewer mentioned the saltiness of the cheese.   Not only was the cheese far too salty in my opinion but the sausage was below average in the taste department.  Toward the end of my eating experience here,  I picked the cheese and sausage off because they tasted so bad.  I doubt I will be back.  I can go to Fired Pie and get a superior tasting pizza that is around the same price and that is a lot closer to my home."}
{"text":"One price for an 11\" pizza with whatever you want on it. You can't beat this! The toppings are fresh, delicious, and expansive. I also love that it's a thinner crust- my favorite. The last time I went in, it took awhile to get my order in (due to re-stocking ingredients and a complicated previous order), but they were incredibly nice about it and offered a comped drink for my trouble. Anytime I'm in the mood for pizza, I'm going to go here before any other pizza chain."}
{"text":"Pizza was fantastically delicious. Gluten free is also super good and the service was great"}
{"text":"Its a great place for families. Their pizza is very reasonably priced, the atmosphere is perfect. I love that the open the large garage door to the patio. My husband prefers this pizza to any other place."}
{"text":"MOD Pizza is cool as hell!  I love the idea of personally creating my own pizza exactly how I wanted.  There's soooo many ingredients to choose from.  My favorite pizza includes:  Double Crust - any crust because otherwise it's gonna taste like a flatbread pizza, which I don't mind but I want flatbread when I want it.  When I want regular pizza I want regular pizza so I make sure to get double crust.  Red Sauce  Red onions  Roasted garlic  Spinach Spicy sausage Pepperoni  Mushrooms  Green peppers  Roasted red peppers  A little balsamic and pesto drizzle on top and I'm in LOVE!"}
{"text":"This was our first trip to Mod Pizza. Everyone in our family of four liked it. Pizza was delicious, staff was very friendly, price was right, and food options were good. We liked the atmosphere better than Fired Pie. Our one suggestion is to simply turn down the music JUST a tad. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch today, finally getting to try it for the first time!  I pass this place daily so I was anticipating the day we would finally try MOD Pizza!  We both ordered our own pizza, both got the mini, which was the perfect size for us!  With two pizzas and one drink it was around $12.  Very reasonable for lunch!  I couldn't tell you what Kevin ordered, but I ordered pizza with white sauce, garlic rub, 3 different cheeses, chicken, spinach, mushrooms, onions, peppers, and sundried tomatoes.  It was very delicious!  MOD has it down great.  You get all the toppings you could want to create the pizza you want at the same price, brings it out to you very quickly, and creates a pizza with great flavor with plenty of topping choices!    We sat put on the patio area with our dog, so we can see us coming back here with warm weather!  Can't wait to try more pizzas and floats/shakes!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Good, fast service. MOD Pizza is a family favorite as everyone can get what they please on their pizza for a low price.  Everyone at this location was super friendly. The manager was awesome, always making sure we had the best service and food that we can. You could tell he is a good leader and passionate about his job."}
{"text":"Jessica thought that it was ok to scratch her face and not change her gloves, prior to going back to handling our food. I asked if she wouldn't mind changing her gloves before preparing my salad, but she became rude and defensive. Whoa!! I shouldn't have to ask, it's disgusting and unsanitary. We left not doing business with them, and she seemed to find humor in the situation. Typical young minded girl!  Trashy first time experience at MOD."}
{"text":"Just tried this new pizza place that opened. An Applebee's was demolished to make room it and a very popular Starbucks. Not that impressed.   I used the mobile app to order. Told me my pizza and salad would be ready in 25 minutes. I worked at a pizza joint as a teen and could make, bake and box a pie in less than 15 minutes. Perhaps it takes an extra 10 minutes because of their volume.   I show up 20 minutes after ordering and inquire about the status. They just started making the pizza. Say what? 20 minutes to process an order? There were maybe 10 people in the place and only 1 person waiting for an order.   10 minutes later, my pizza and salad are ready. The counter guy even brought it to my table. A nice touch. But 30 minutes for something that at Z Pizza takes about 10?   Then I pick up the pizza box and salad bowl and am a bit underwhelmed by the weight. My Z Pizza--another build-your-own pie place-- is usually about twice as heavy.   My wife and I split the white sauce thin crust pizza and build-your-own salad. Despite my misgivings about the pizza, the crust was superb and the pizza overall tasted sublime. Never had whole garlic cloves on a pizza before, but the roasted chunks were pretty innocent.  The salad--a mix of romaine and mixed greens with lots of toppings was uninspiring. We had the balsamic dressing. Pretty bland. I'm sure a bagged salad mix from a grocery store tastes better.  The good news...I got free Starbucks internet while I waited. Sweet!  I know it just opened, but I would have ordered and gotten my bland food faster if the Applebee's was still there. The pizza was good, but I'm not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"We tried this place bc we kept seeing cop cars in front of it. Cops know good restaurants! Had the double layered pizza and it was pretty good but not amazing, there are tons of toppings to choose from. The atmosphere was cool and the staff were very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Finally got some MOD pizza and it was pretty awesome. I love how you can customize your pizza and there is just one fixed price, regardless of which and how many toppings you get.  The topping selection was a bit overwhelming so I went with one of their pre-designed pizzas - the Dillon James - and then added bacon to it.  The pizza tasted great!  It's a thin crust style dough - a bit thinner and crispier than a New York style - and the pizzas are individual sized at 11\".  One minor annoyance was that they cut the pizza into quarters instead of sixths.  Picking up and eating a quarter slice of an 11\" thin crust can be challenging, especially if you get too many toppings. Anyways, for those in Charlotte, I would recommend MOD Pizza over Brixx if your looking for individual-sized pizza."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying out MOD Pizza last week and my experience went well. The prices our fair and you can customize your pizza however you like. The employees there are friendly and provide quick and excellent service. I will most likely be coming back to MOD Pizza if I am in the area again."}
{"text":"I love MOD. Second time at this location. Everyone is super friendly. The pizza is quick and awesome. I like the different sizes for someone like me who can get by on a kids meal. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"We first tried Mod Pizza in Steele Creek and thought it was wonderful. Fresh and  tasty. We eagerly waited for the Matthews location to open but have been disappointed with the result. The pizza isn't food. I'm not sure why but they need a troubleshooter in to fix it. The staff is friendly and energetic but still green. The pizza should be as good as it is at Rivergate.  Think it will be, but it isn't tonight."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza!! They make it easy and fun! Everyone was having fun and super friendly!! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. The pizzas are excellent--our new go-to for weekend cheat night or office lunches!"}
{"text":"A fixed rate for pizza prices no matter what toppings you put on! And they have milkshakes and floats and sodas ! And wine and beer! Check it out"}
{"text":"New place and we LOVE it!. The flavor of the pizza and toppings are great. They are quick, priced great and friendly staff. First time we chose one of their suggested pizzas. It was good but we were still a little hungry so we purchased a small personal size one. That combination filled us up. We went again and both hubby and I got a personal size. He put more ingredients on his and was filled up. I put less and could have eaten another slice or two. The third time we went we tried the double crust and were stuffed! My only complaint about this restaurant is the indoor seating is very limited. There is lots of outdoor seating and come cooler weather I am sure it will be adequate for diners. I love the crisp thin crusts and their staff is the BEST!"}
{"text":"Finally gave this place a try. The process was easy the pizza came out fast and it was really good!  The crust was in my opinion the best. I like how crispy it was and the pizza was not overwhelmed with ingredients.  So far my favorite pizza place!"}
{"text":"Wow excellent pizza, fresh ingredients displayed, great salad excellent prices.  I think this place is new and will slowly get more and more crowded once word gets out."}
{"text":"We just love MOD Pizza. The staff is so friendly with fantastic customer service.  The delicious thin crust is topped with whatever toppings your heart desires. Try the Marionberry Lemonade - it's out of this world!  We've become regulars at this location which only happens for us when there is the perfect combination of great service and great food."}
{"text":"So I just left this location, absolutely the best customer service I have ever received point blank. The GM Brian (general manager) could see I was having a rough day and even gave me a hug. And the pizza is probably the best I have ever had and I'm from NY so I have high pizza standards. Thanks for being AWESOME!"}
{"text":"We ordered a personal pizza and a salad with garlic strips. The food was really good, fair priced and the place was fairly busy when we arrived. The wait was short."}
{"text":"I went here once, the other day, and am very happy that i did. So much so that this might be my favorite pizza place nearby now.   You go in and pick your size crust. They then ask you to choose every ingredient you want, from the sauce to the seasoning. They also have various pre-made guides for those that want to try their specialized recipes and you can add or omit from them as you please. Basically, it's whatever you want.  Personally, I like that I can create my own from scratch, but since I plan to come here often, I may just GO CRAZY and try one of their already made recipes that require no thought on my part.   Also, their prices are pleasantly reasonable considering that you can get a filling pizza that you designed yourself. Despite what at least one reviewer has said, Mod's medium size is not the same as a small/personal size everywhere else. It is more in line with a fancy thin crust pizza from the frozen food section at a grocery store.  Anyway, I'm speaking in terms of size only here, not taste or freshness or anything like that. The food here definitely tastes fresh to me.  You may just want to review other reviewer's pictures, and note that they have a large size that I'm sure one extra hungry person can stuff themselves on.   So you finish your pizza design and then go pay. You can get your drink, sit down, chat for a few minutes, and then when they call your name (and likely look at you directly), you go get it. They even offer to put some extra sauce or seasoning on top of it if you want.   I got my pizza back and was immediately surprised at how much it transformed. I admit, when they were making it, I was thinking to myself, \"man, they should put a little more love and care into it. Gosh, it's just heaped into a pile.\" You ever eat a burrito at Taco Bell and it's like all the cheese is on one end and the sour cream or whatever is at the other (which sucks by the way)? Yeah, that's what I was thinking when they were putting my pizza together, except that everything was just in the middle. In a pile. I thought I would have just a bunch of burnt toppings on top of melted cheese.    HOWEVER. When I got it back, cooked, I was very pleased with myself for designing the best pizza ever.  It was good too. I mean, really good.  I guess maybe the person cooking evened it out... or something, I don't know, but it was just marvelous. It tasted great.  The atmosphere was standard. Not cozy, not crowded, not bare and clinical (like a hospital). Just a normal place. Similar to.... let's see... Firehouse Subs kind of, but bigger, I would say. I found it funny that one reviewer mentioned employee break room because when I was there not only were a few employees eating or hanging out, but employees from nearby businesses where there eating as well. It's like it was Rivergate's lunch break. I couldn't care less about that though.    All in all, I was just impressed with how the pizza turned out and tasted and I loved the concept."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite pizza place!  Why, you ask?  The staff are super friendly and helpful.  The dining room is clean. But most of all they offer a reasonably priced gluten-free pizza!!!  I can add as many toppings as I like at no extra cost, which I love since I already have to pay extra for a gluten-free crust.  Dine-In or take-out, MOD pizza is a terrific deal!"}
{"text":"I like this place.  You have to pay per person since the only make personal pizzas, but you don't have to pay for toppings, so it winds up being relatively inexpensive compared to other pizza places in area.  Lots of toppings options, and you can get whatever you want.  Isn't the best pizza i've ever had, but certainly is good, and worth the price."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza. Truly a great value. If you like oven baked pizza this is the place to go. They will make the pizza right in front of you. Just be prepared to wait around 10 to 15 minutes depending on the crowd."}
{"text":"These guys/ gals are seriously the best! Not only is the food great but the service is even better! It's a fun way to have made to order pizza in a wood fire oven. And always friendly staff with great attitudes. We continue to drive to this location specifically because of the staff! Oh and they have local craft beer on tap! Bonus! Thanks for being so great!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to give five stars but I think based on its genre and quality of ingredients I had to tip my hat. My wife and I came here for a late night dinner and we're happy to discover their delicious specials including a local favorite called the \"Tyler\".   I also have to mention the house made lemonade which was delicious. Especially the marionberry version which I had never tried previously. I hope more people recognize this awesome new place so we can keep it here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"OMG, the food is amazing. The selection available means I can have something new almost every time we go. The customer service is also phenomenal, so nice and willing to help answer any question. Will be recommending this place to all of my friends and family."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite pizza place! I love being able to customize my pizza to a tee and get exactly what I want every single time. I love the sizes they offer and the reasonable prices as well. They also have delicious caramelized pear herbal tea and Marion berry lemonade."}
{"text":"This place was very interesting. The pizzas are made very quickly and I love the fact that it's made right in front of you. I also love that you can choose as many toppings as you like without extra cost. Taste is amazing. Very clean inside. Kind of small restaurant so it's great for a small group of friends. The staff is always very friendly. Definitely enjoy coming here. They always have smiles on their faces and that makes me leave feeling good."}
{"text":"The staff is rude, and they're stingy with their pepperonis.   Go to Fired Pie instead."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing customer service, and the pizza is just as good! I'd highly recommend this super modern pizza place! I now have an obsession with thin crust! The employee Yasmeer was super friendly and welcoming at the cash register. MOD pizza is where it's at!"}
{"text":"My kids are huge Fired Pie fans, so we thought being the same concept, it would be as good. Nope. They are very skimpy with toppings; we had to ask for extra cheese just to cover their pizzas. Pizzas were very bland. When the kids give thumbs down on a pizza....well, you know it's not that great. Also worth mentioning, it was 9pm on a Saturday, and only a few other patrons were there besides us, but every table was dirty. Back to Fired Pie we go next time!"}
{"text":"Absolute great employees. The customer service was amaaazzing. My pizza bubbled so the employee took the initiative to make me a new pizza and gave me the barely ruined one. The pizza is great as well. Fun to make. The crust has the perfect crisp. Just great."}
{"text":"Great concept, good food, friendly staff.  I ate at a direct competitor on a recent trip to Portland (pieology), which just didn't match the ingredients available at MOD (no roasted red peppers?  WTF?)  I give it 4 stars because, as a native New Yorker, I'm a bit of a pizza snob and this just isn't NY pizza...still really good though.  Based on some other reviews, I tried the lemonade...and that $h!t was damn good!  If you have a slightly bigger appetite, try the Mega, it's a double crust pizza with a layer of sauce and cheese between the 2 crusts...like a stuffed crust pizza, I dig it."}
{"text":"We have been to MOD pizza 4 time now for a quick pizza and beer. We love friendly staff and the fact you can get any toppings on one pizza for less than $8. The pizza is tasty thin crust and is done by the time you find a place to sit, great for the price. San Tan beer was great but the wine need some more aging. Things Brian the manager could improve maybe change the seating inside very limited, floor needs a good mopping and outside metal patio furniture needs work to keep table from wobbling."}
{"text":"Great pizza, easy process, quick! Fantastic chocolate shake, which I don't normally equate with pizza but get it anyway"}
{"text":"My friend and I were excited to try it, but from the minute we walked in i had a sinking feeling we should head out. Service was SLOOOOOW and the dough maker wasn't wearing gloves.  Ordered the seasonal Mod and it was salty. Needless to say we won't be back. We'll stick with fired pie...."}
{"text":"Best pizza! Not heavy and greasy like typical pizza. Great pizza and salads for amazing prices! It's now a regular stop!"}
{"text":"Great food, ordered online and when we arrived at the restaurant for pick up they hadn't even stared the order. Not a big deal but we did go to a few other places before actually stopping in. We will be back though!"}
{"text":"Really tasty pizza! They have many options and you can also customize your pizza! The dough is light and you eat without feeling guilty. Super friendly staff! Really recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great place awesome staff. Made me feel like a kid in a candy shop! Amazing how you can add anything you want for one price!! I almost felt like I was stealing all the toppings!! Also they have great gluten free crust!"}
{"text":"We tried this and loved it!  Fresh, clean and fantastic food.  Simple and delicious!  Management and staff friendly and helpful.  New favorite go to for pizza and salad!  Can't beat the price!"}
{"text":"There are many of these order your pizza at the counter and they put it in a brick oven places popping up around. I have tried a few and this one is by far my favorite. You can pick your own toppings or get a combination on the wall. It is quick, easy and affordable. We also live down the street. The lemonade is made in house and is very good and the pear iced tea is also good. They also have \"no name cake\" for dessert which is like a homemade version of a little Debbie's snack cake. The service is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The outside seating was shaded and great for our dog to join us. The pizzas are ordered in a line up like Subway. We had a caspian, a cooper and a Dominic with pesto drizzle. These pizzas were all amazing! They are on a crust that reminds me of fry bread. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This place makes me kinda sad.. Although it's the pizza of Subway, the flavor is nonexistent. The sauce is the most important part of a pizza and theirs is bland. I wish there were more choices with the crust, but it's either thin or nada."}
{"text":"I have to praise this place. We came in late on the Sunday after a trip. My friend paid for us due to my early birthday. I guess the employee heard of it& gave us a free dessert- cinnamon strips. We were amazed both our pizzas and cinnamon strips tasted really good with different textures of dough.  The environment is cozy and employees are super nice with great customer service. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"This place has seriously good pizza, awesome atmosphere and great customer service. Thoroughly impressed for a gourmet fast pizza experience. Also, balsamic. Fig. Glaze...sooooooo good! :)"}
{"text":"Good food and nice staff. I will go back and every out of town visitor I have come to visit me, I will bring them here because it is different from most pizza places."}
{"text":"Toppings are very good, however, have trouble with some of the guys only putting a small amount of \"whatever\" in one small area. Will give you more if you ask, but you have to ask them to please spread it evenly around pizza. An important part of pizza for me is the crust. I would rate theirs a one minus. It's often too soft, not at all bready.  Wish they would cut the pieces a little smaller, too, for easier handling.   Do love their floats, and they give you free refills."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to this place. The vibe was really cool when I first walked in, but then I was really intimidated by the menu. The cool thing here is that you pay like $8 for whatever medium sized pizza you want. The toppings are all included. You want to try a bit of everything, but the menu does not lay out what they have well. You basically get a list of things that they may or may not have and then everything they do have isn't even on the menu. They have a lot of starter pizzas, but they're all over the place and it's hard to find a solid starter and add onto it. Eventually it turned into a subway experience with me pointing through the glass at what I wanted, which made the menu feel useless. Other than the intimidating first ordering process, everything else was great. The pizza was like an 8 out of 10 and the service was nice. The place is very trendy. It's not a place that I would take a date, but it's a perfect spot for hanging out with friends. When I went, it wasn't really busy, so not too many customers were talking, but it sounded like the staff was really loud. It's kind of understandable because the kitchen is not separate from the dining area, but I'd hate to here the place on a really busy day. Overall I loved the place and I'm probably going back with more friends."}
{"text":"Went tonight with my wife and we both really enjoyed it. I built my own and my wife got their #4 (Dominic). I loaded mine up but the #4 my wife got looked empty and in need of a bunch more toppings. She said it was very good though.  The Caramelized Pear Iced Tea was outstanding (not real sweet) and both Lemonades were really good (regular and blackberry).  Only complaint I had was that no one was cleaning tables or emptying trash the entire time we were in there and they were full.  We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Pizza fast how you want it! Don't be scared by a long line.....it's worth the wait! Everyone can get what they want at a reasonable pride a must try!!!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza. They have several options or you can create your own. All pizzas are the same price no matter what toppings depending on size. I love that they have a mini so I am not stuck eating plain cheese with my 3 year old. We will be back for sure"}
{"text":"This build your own pizza place works just like the rest. They have a few more ingredients which is nice- namely ricotta. I have always been greeted the same way...with zero eye contact and a \"what's your name?\" Does it change the way my pizza tastes? Nope."}
{"text":"I love MOD! Have never heard of it before and now that I work across the road at Lydian Dental I'm hooked! It's at least a weekly stop! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The whole staff was very friendly. The line always seems to be very long but it moves very quickly. The only problem I did have was the cashier charging me for a MOD pizza ($7.77) when I ordered the mini ($4.77) with just cheese, pepperoni and pineapple.  I asked her if they were any charges for the toppings but she told me the taxes were $5.... Um okay sure. I looked back at my receipt and then realize she did over charge me. The store manager took care of it with out any hesitation. The prices are reasonable considering the fact there is no extra charge for toppings. The crust is thin so you might not want to pile on to much! They also have a good beverage selection as well.  I do consider coming back next time :)"}
{"text":"I love mod salads and my hubby loves the pizza. Best of all-GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! The employees appear to love their job. Mod must be a fun place to work. It is certainly a great place to eat. I love that I can customize my salads."}
{"text":"I went in late because I thought they were open later but they are only open till 9pm. But they were very friendly and made a great pizza! The interior is filled with concrete and hard surfaces so if you want a quiet dinner, this is not the place. But the employees were very helpful and my food was great!"}
{"text":"It's a good option near my area because it's the only one like it close to me but i prefer Fired Pie anyway.  Staff is very very nice, that is a good point.  Flavor is really pretty good if you know what you like, which i do. I've ordered the same combination between FP and this Mod and consistently find the flavor and quantity is better at FP. Here's my combo: pesto base, chicken, bacon, mozzarella, red onions/sauteed onions, sun dried tomato, finished with basil...i always ask for extra pesto and they are in the stingy side at those location.. I know it's a little more expensive but it's not ordered regularly so they should be able to offset the cost (I'm assuming.. Me with my zero food industry related experience :))..i say not ordered regularly because it's only on the build your own and you kind of have to look for it, it's not that obvious an option.  I still come because like i said, if I'm at home, this is the closest option... But if I'm out, I'll pick FP over Mod at this point.  Great concept and they have a nice staff so that means a lot, too."}
{"text":"On 11/12/15 about 6:15 pm service from staff was GREAT . New young man on the line was new and had great 'people' skills. We always look to see how patient and courteous the staff is wherever we go to eat . Well done and thank you ! Yes our pizza & salad was also great ! We'll be back."}
{"text":"The possibilities are endless....You tell them the size of pizza you want (MOD size is perfect) and then you tell them what toppings you want.  Add as many toppings as you want and the price is the same!  That's the nice part.    Service has always been good and quick.  The lemonade is awesome!!    We never eat in because the sitting is horrible.  We have 2 children, one in a carseat and there are only 2 booths, one if which people in line are right up in your business.  They have high top tables and big family style tables.  Not very family friendly seating."}
{"text":"This place is DIRTY!!!  Not a clean table to be had.  Busy place.  I get trying to get the line down and getting people fed but can't you spare 1 employee to sweep the food off the floor and wipe down the tables?  I, the customer, had to get the food crumbs off the our seats, wipe the table by pouring my water in a napkin, and use my shoe to kick the food into the isle so hopeful one of those busy employees could see it."}
{"text":"i can not believe the amount of choices you have when coming to MOD pizza. They will give you as many toppings as you want. It is more pricey but for what you get it is worth it."}
{"text":"When my family and I stopped in we weren't really sure what this place was all we knew was one thing. PIZZA. We went in and it was pretty busy ( always a good sign ) the staff was extremely friendly and the manga men of expediting the pizzas to reduce the wait time was great . My kids live it because they get to order their own personal pizza with whatever they want on it. Did I mention it's yummy? It is! There was a slight hiccup w my order but that is to be expected when it is super busy and the manager fixed it right away and gave me a brand new pizza to take home w me . Now that is customer service and that along w the great food is what is going to keep customers like myself coming back!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza deal around. Price is very affordable and unique  first time got it to go. Pulled the menu online. Got the mad dog. When I picked it up and went to pay it was just over 7$. And it was loaded. Thin crispy crust  very good."}
{"text":"I love the pizza. They got part of my order wrong one time and went above and beyond to make it right. Excellent customer service! Thanks to the manager."}
{"text":"Quoth my 11 year old, \"I love so much that it doesn't make my hands feel greasy!\"  It's crisp tasty fresh tasting build a pizza for-a-flat-price goodness. What's not to like? I accidentally got one without red sauce (the #3, add black olive and spinach and rosemary) and it was amazing!    !"}
{"text":"Nice little quick place to eat. Only thing I disliked was the music was to loud to hear your name called. But overall super cool workers great food."}
{"text":"One of the only times I've been let down by yelpers. I have no idea how this pizza joint has 4 stars. We got take out. There pizza was doubled thin crust pizza which I am not a fan of and the garlic strips were like wood. I like Chicago style pizza."}
{"text":"It's not that I didn't like MOD...I just like Blaze better.   So I'd had this place bookmarked for a while and finally had the opportunity to give them a try. Same concept as Blaze (promise this is the last time I'll bring up the competition, lol) you order your pizza...however you want with as many toppings as you can for one standard price.   Easy enough and I still love the idea of getting whatever I want for the same price!   A HUGE win for them, though is that they offer a mini version. In my opinion it's the perfect size and portion for lunch...and just like the regular size you can get as many toppings as you want.  Since it was my first time I created my own. They have a wall full of already customized pizzas that you can chose from or just need a bit of a head start. I decided to try the white sauce, with the sausages, chicken and bacon and veggies.  I didn't love the white sauce or the crust. It's a thin crust that flaky but I think it's a little too thin and that made it hard to cut and hold the slices. But the toppings were fresh and the service from start to finish was great.   For now...MOD is just ok in my book. But I'm going to give their original sauce a try and see what I think...stay tuned."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place after driving by it 100s of times! Very glad I stopped.  Excellent ingredients, nice employees, fair prices, and top notch pies.  They kick the food out in a timely manner, so I'm glad I stopped and will definitely be back.  My mini pizza was so good that I ordered another one after I finished the initial order!  Great place, very refreshing!  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"After living in Bellevue, Washington where Mod pizza is known for being one of the bests pizza places! I have happy to see that there was one it my area, so I immediately thought that I must go! After visiting Mod I was pleased to find out that the food is just as good as any other Mod I will become a regular!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm...I do love me some MOD pizza. It's quick, ingredients are fresh, and the staff is always friendly. Three size choice, each with their own price for as many toppings as you want. They also have a pizza salad (salad on top of a garlicky pizza bottom), bread sticks, and cinnamon sticks with dipping sauce.   Choose from their menu or make your own (I have one child who loves the Tyler, and one that loves the Mad Dog)...all set up Chipotle style. Choose your sauce (red, pesto, alfredo, all three :)), meats, veggies (there is a roasted selection that changes frequently), and cheeses. When it comes out of the oven you have your choice of finishing sauces, if that's what you are into.  Local beers on tap (I think there might be wine too) but I usually get the lemonade. It's delicious.  Take a MOD sticker, write a message, and slap it on the wall. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza! Delicious, affordable, perfect for the whole family. My family and I first tried this pizza a couple months ago, and now we go every week. Totally addicted! They have quick and easy order and pay online, I just stop and pick it up on my way home from work. I need to ask if they have a frequent flyer card! :) good job guys, thanks for the delicious pizza"}
{"text":"MOD = Made On Drugs?  We usually like visiting MOD with the family but were turned off by the juvenile feeling Friday, January 5, 2018.  Our pizza cook was wearing a \"Kush Life\" beanie therefore openly promoting marijuana.  I hope she isn't the manager.  Let's wear Family appropriate clothing, shall we?"}
{"text":"Better than Fired Pie & Blaze, and a little bit cheaper, too!   We've been looking for the best make-your-own pizza chain in Phoenix for a while, and I think we've finally found it. We came here recently and both ordered the regular customizable pie. While the ingredients and process are very similar to Fired Pie and Blaze, it's a bit cheaper, and the employees are always a LOT nicer. Everyone made us feel very welcome, and continually asked if there was anything else we wanted on our pizzas. While we can technically get the same things at Blaze and Fired Pie, sometimes the employees act irritated when we ask for additional vegetables, meats, etc. We also love the drizzles at the pizza pick-up station! I recommend the balsamic fig.  In addition, they have really good in-house drinks, like their iced herbal tea and lemonade, which are a welcome departure from the standard soda fountain fare.  We'll be back, and can't wait for our next Mod experience!"}
{"text":"This is a make it your way pizzeria with a decent beverage choice. They need a bigger lobby because it's always packed. But that's a good problem to have. Right?"}
{"text":"Finally heard back from manager and was sent a gift card in the mail. Didn't use it for many months. But once I did, I had a much more pleasant experience. I guess 3rd time IS a charm! Thanks Mod pizza for caring about your customers. Even when delayed."}
{"text":"Dissapointed. We love the pizza but they are not generous with their toppings or fixings.  When they put toppings on, every time we've gone we have had to ask them to double what they put on because it doesnt even cover a large enough area of pizza.  Tonight we Got our salads home and it only filled less then half the small to go container and it was saturated with dressing (see pictures).  Also realized they dont have a pizza salad combo which i thought we were ordering. It is not a combo and their marketing how it is presented is misleading.   It says pizza or salad but if you read it fast with how the menu is set up looks like it is a pizza/salad combo. For that money i can get a pizza and salad for less $ at other pizza places."}
{"text":"Pizza was tasty, perfectly cooked and crispy on the edges. The person working had a great personality and helped us pick our toppings. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've never ate a pizza place like this before, but it was quick, delicious, and reasonably priced! Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Good pizza if you are looking for a personal size pizza. I loved the fact I could build my own pizza and it was cooked right in front of me. and the price for the pizza is amazing. Good pizza for a good price."}
{"text":"My 2 year old and I loved this place! The pizza was amazing!  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Omg what a ripoff. Their large pizza is the size of a small anywhere else. Maybe a medium if you lucky. Quality is horribly cheap as well. Almost would rate this same as Little Caesars or maybe a step above but I think you get more with them for half the cost. Don't waste you time here. Go to a real pizza shop and steer clear."}
{"text":"The people are very friendly and the service is great. The pizza was just so-so. A lot of grease, stale sausage, not a lot of taste not enough sauce."}
{"text":"If you miss the Pie Five in Matthews this is another option until Pieology (IMO better tasting) opens in epicenter. Over all tasted good and I liked their double crust better than their thin crust."}
{"text":"This was our first time going to MOD, have heard lots of great things about it.. But to say the least I was thoroughly disappointed with the customer service at this location. We even told the staff it was our first time, and we felt like we were in their way. It felt like the entire staff hated being there.. Overall we left feeling bummed out. The pizza was pretty good but nothing to write home about. Not sure I will be going back here but definitely not to this location."}
{"text":"If you like subway, then you'll like this place. You can customize your own pizza and watch them build it in front of you. The pizza is good, the price is good, and so is the service. Definitely going back there again."}
{"text":"Great customer service, really good thin crust pie, but by no means a cracker crust. Properly cooked in the very expensive fire oven. Vast ingredient selection, infinite options. Hope the franchise spreads to my town."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!! I wish there was one out in East Mesa closer to where I actually live. I also wish the parking lot wasn't always so stinking packed. I bet they'd have a lot more customers if it wasn't such a crazy house trying to get in and out of a parking spot.   With that being said, imagine subway but for pizza! As many toppings as you want for one low price. I got the \"mod\" (medium) size the first time, but have gotten the small version ever since. It's a thin crust but very filling! And so fresh! The customer service is outstanding. You always are greeted with a smile and said goodbye to as you leave.   The absolute best thing about MOD? The lemonade... OMG! I think I would stop in here JUST for the lemonade. It's that good.  All in all, you need to try this place. Highly recommended. Fun place to take out of staters too. Unique concept anyone can be happy with. Gluten free options too!"}
{"text":"I love the pizza here! Unlimited toppings for less than $9!!!! The workers here are friendly and I love their milkshakes. I've been here 3 times in one month.  that says something."}
{"text":"I loved it! Not only did I have the opportunity to create my own pizza, I also had a choice of sizes! Unlike the other places that only have one size, I was able to choose between a personal pan or bigger or even one with a thicker crust! Oh no they didn't! Then there is a big variety of choices that are not typically available at other places. I decided to create something that I never have done before, veggies on my pizza........who does that? Then I topped off the pie delight with Mike's Hot Honey! Sweet like honey with a, wait for it..........little spicy kick! The staff were great too! I loved it and am looking forward to going again!"}
{"text":"MOD Pizza on Peoria Avenue is always a fun place to go. It is build your own pizza and they are very generous when you ask them for extra ingredients. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about what their products are. They're always happy to add an extra sprinkle of this or a squirt of that before baking the pizza in the fiery open oven. If you are on a tight schedule for lunch hour or half-hour this is your place! The quickest service for a good meal that's inexpensive. You can even call in your order for even faster service. I like that they honor the military with a special discount also. It's like going to Subway and picking your own ingredients but it's pizza toppings instead, and boy is it good! I highly recommend going to this location if you are on a budget and in a hurry. It's a decent clean place to sit and eat also."}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good. The uniqueness comes from being able create whatever you want from fresh ingredients. We had a couple of their creations and couple of our own. They also serve gluten free crusts."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great service, nice atmosphere and friendly staff! Convenient locations, works perfectly when I need my lunch. I definitely recommend you to try this place."}
{"text":"My newest favorite pizza spot. Like the idea on personal pizza being made with unlimited topping all for the same price."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, nice patio!  Fun concept where you select as many toppings as you want at one flat price.  We went during the opening week, and the line was long...took about 20 minutes to get thru the line to place the order, and then another 15 minutes to order and pick it up at the counter after baking.  We'll try again on a night when it's not so crowded.  This place is right across the street from Hamilton High School and will be a haven for the teen crowd after school and ballgames."}
{"text":"Great service!!!! Delicious pizza!!! A must if you are shopping at Tempe Marketplace. I had two of the house favorites and the taste combinations were wonderful. I highly recommend. Pricing is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Do not understand the buzz about this place.  The crust is way to soft and thin. Just not very good.  Very expensive too for what you get.  Frozen store pizza is better.  One thing they do have however is gluten free, soy free options which is nice   It's just too bad its not very good."}
{"text":"As a pizza lover I was excited to try this new spin on pizza. I was not disappointed with MOD pizza. Great value, solid flavors, staff was helpful, cool atmosphere, and quick. We went on saturday during prime time lunch rush. Restaurant was fairly busy, but not full. Within 5 mins we had ordered are specialty pizza's ( tristan add bacon and BYO with bacon, pepperoni, mushroom, pineapple, and bbq drizzle), paid and were waiting patiently for our names to be called. Less than 5 mins passed before they were ready. I would suggest not loading your pizza with too many ingredients though, because the integrity of the slice becomes comprised due to thin crust. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"First time here...late dinner (after 7) and on a weekday. There was a line of about 6 people in front of me, line was moving pretty quick. I ordered a white sauce pizza with chicken, bacon, pineapple, olives, grilled corn and gorgonzola! Cool idea like salad bar where you can pick and choose your toppings. Sat at a high table while waiting for it to be cooked (plenty of seating inside and outside). Guy calls your name loud enough to actually hear it, which is great. Next time I'm asking for my pizza to be cut in to 6 pieces..."}
{"text":"Great concept  You pick your toppings. You pick the type of dough used. Fresh vegetables plus more. Very cool place. Just cool place to hang. Hip Place with super friendly people who work there. I would be come back again. Keep up the great work guys and gals."}
{"text":"We usually love MOD but not this location.  We recently moved & are missing \"our\" MOD.  First time we were here we thought maybe they were having a tough day, employees looking a bit worn, dirty tables & chairs...today, even worse! Employees making our pizza was coughing & looked as if he hadn't showered in a few days. The rest of the staff wasnt in any better shape.  Like last time, every single table, inside & out was dirty, sadly dirty floors too.  We will have to take MOD off our list of places we frequent, well st least until we move!"}
{"text":"Hey Mod Pizza has a new NO Carb Pizza!!! Stopped in to pick up some pizza on our way home.  When we went to order the server told us that they had no dough.... Seriously how do you run out of dough at a pizza place."}
{"text":"Love the choice of options... Plus ending result are amazing! But employees could do a little better placing the toppings"}
{"text":"This is exactly what we've been waiting for on this side of town. Quick, easy, cheap, and freaking delicious. I love that I can easily get a vegan pizza without having to make a bunch of special requests, and the staff is always super friendly. They yell hello and goodbye as you go through the door which is cute, and the line always moves very quickly. In fact, I was just there to pick up an order I placed online and I showed up a bit early. The guy apologized for my pizzas not being ready and gave me a drink on the house while I waited. Love coming here."}
{"text":"The pizza place I've been waiting for! My wife and I have very different taste in pizza, and Mod lets us both have what we want. And the pizza itself is great.  I only recently discovered Mod, so for the similarly uninitiated, here's how it works: You pick a pizza size (6\", 11\", or double-crust 11\"), each of which comes with a fixed cost; then you tell them the toppings you want (of course, they have several options from which to start). They assemble it in front of you and bake it quickly--the quickness makes this a great place for workday lunches."}
{"text":"I just kept walking by this place because this may be the third pizza place in this spot. When my wife told me that a new pizza place had opened there I had to laugh and quip, \"I wonder how long this one will last\".  The last one wasn't even there long for me to even try.  It took me awhile but I walking in today.  You can can select a pie from the menu or create your own.  They charge one price for the pie regardless of toppings. I mixed the garlic olive oil and pesto for the base sauce. I topped it with a sun dried tomatoes, olives, mushrooms, artichoke hearts. Sprinkled feta, asiago, parmesan  and mozzarella. I had them put on some fresh basil and some crumbled bacon. The thin crust pizza goes into a 730 degree wood fired oven. I pored my drink, and sat down. Just a few minutes later the pizza was brought to the table. The crust had a perfect crisp char and was very good The larger size pie and a drink was $10.50. That's the same price for a burger fries and drink at Burger McCappy's. I will return soon. I really hope this one sticks around. Heck, if I had friends I would even bring them too."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place because everyone told me it was as good as Blaze pizza in Tempe. They were so confused and got my orders wrong and mixed up. After acknowledging my order was wrong, it took an additional 15 minutes to get it. By then my family was already finished eating...so much for eating a Sunday lunch with my family.   Customer service is not up to par as they did not seem apologetic for messing up my order.   Compared to Blaze, their pizza size is smaller. The taste of the pizza was average. Cleanliness, it was hard to find a clean table for my family of 5 to sit.  First impressions go along way and I was not impressed during this visit.   ******UPDATE***** 1/25/17  MOD Squad reached out to me after my first review and sent me a gift card to give them another try. My family and I went back on a Wednesday evening for dinner. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with a smile and all employees were courteous and helpful. We each ordered our own pizzas. All of them came out quickly and were delicious!   The restaurant appeared to be clean and it was half full with customers.   After this second try, my family and I will now add MOD as one of the places to consider when we eat out."}
{"text":"The whole 'build your own pie' is a pretty cool concept, but it's a liiiiitle bit pricey for what it is."}
{"text":"Anna was extremely helpful, friendly, and treated everyone that way. Absolutely stellar service, and the pizzas are very well made and succulently tasty."}
{"text":"I've come here quite a few times because I really like the pizza style and their fresh choices of various toppings - except for today. Came here with 5 other colleagues for lunch and immediately noticed that the salads, especially the arugula was wilted and no longer fresh. I, as well as my colleague mentioned this to the associate who didn't even acknowledge this fact, yet sought guidance from another associate. Eventually the salad tray was exchanged with another, same scenario: the arugula was old, wilted and was not suitable to be served. My colleague then overheard the associate asking if they should throw it out, while the other one signaled \"no\".  We were disgusted that this even happened.  #1: why do customers need to bring it to the associate's attention that the salad they're serving is bad?  #2 what kind of associate requires guidance regarding the quality of wilted salad?  #3 where was the manager and inventory of their food?  Not sure I or my colleagues want to come here again as this may only be the surface of poor quality control."}
{"text":"So many choices, where does one even begin? I've been here before and got carried away with trying to get a little of everything, but ended up with a pizza that had way too much going on. This I stayed smart and stuck with one from the menu, the squad favorite, the 'ava jane. I didn't alert it at all, except for a BBQ swirl on half, and it was awesome!!! On it is a great combo of red sauce, mozzarella, bacon, pineapple, red onion, jalapenos, and parmesan. I am really happy I didn't alter it, but Mod Pizza had no bounds. Take away or add anything your heart desires. Just know one thing, when you had anchovies, like I did the first time I was here, expect a pizza that tastes like anchovies and nothing else, regardless of what else you do. The staff are all great and great you as you walk in. Very friendly! I look forward to my next visit. Especially during happy hour!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite build your own pizza places to go to. Especially since I don't eat meat. I am able to add all the veggies I want from spinach, broccoli, jalapeños, carrots, green peppers, mushrooms, corn, etc. They also have garbanzos beans to add the protein you need but on the day I went they didn't have any. Other favorite thing is the sauces you can add at the end. I love the balsamic fig and pesto drizzle. You can also select Daiya cheese and gluten free crust. As you can tell this place is great for anybody  Also can't forget the delicious refreshing blackberry lemonade with the sonic style ice that I love so much. Give this place a try for yourself."}
{"text":"I tried out MOD last week hoping it would be as good as Fired Pie who uses the same make your own pizza concept. Unfortunately, it is not. The sauce, crust and cheese all fall short of the quality of Fired Pie.  I appreciate all the choices of toppings and finishing sauces. They also had a larger selection of desserts, but one regular size pie is plenty of food.  The service totally rocks, but not enough to make me forget the food. I'll be sticking with Fired Pie in the future."}
{"text":"It doesn't get much better than this place! Great customer service and awesome pizza! I had a MEGA and it was the bomb! Shannon took care of me and my family, made sure our experience was excellent, which it was. Clean environment and great friendly staff. Can't wait to come back soon."}
{"text":"Great bomb pizza like always best service ever! Best team ever Steven, Julio, Jordan, and Brett!!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch with a good friend here today.  We both like trying new places around the Matthews-Mint Hill area. Neither of us had ever eaten at as Mod Pizza restaurant. It was a a a novel experience though a little confusing at first glance. We asked a lot of questions and got lots of good answers from the staff. Lucky for us it was mid afternoon and they were not very busy. We both decided to build our own pizzas. The only choice we didn't have to make the pizza crust! Everything else from the type of pizza sauce up was an option: white sauce or red sauce, cheeses, meat choices or veggies. The restaurant was bright and open. There were bar tables and dining tables, indoor and outdoor seating. The  restaurant was clean and neat as was the self-serve beverage area. A variety of beers and handmade milkshakes were offered. I saw couples and families dining in and several people coming in for carry out.  Our pizzas were done in less than 10 minutes. The crust was thin and crisp and the toppings were hot and juicy. A very good pizza for a very reasonable price. I can't wait to go back for one of their milkshakes!"}
{"text":"I saw that MOD opened by my office recently and thought I'd give it a shot for lunch! To start, I had pizza for dinner last night, so I decided to try a salad...   If you're running into Panera next door for your lunch-time salad, stop.  The salad I got from MOD was SO good.  Fresh, crunchy, not too much or too little of anything.  AND completely customizable without any extra cost.  Plus the portion was great for the price!  I also grabbed a blackberry lemonade as well, which was delicious.   Lastly, the employees there were totally helpful in walking me through my first time there and were so nice throughout entrance to exit.    I'll be back, often!"}
{"text":"As someone who loves thin crust pizzas, this is my new place! I went with 3 co-workers for lunch to check it out and it was well worth going too. Not only do they offer amazing pizza with all the toppings you want for the same price, they also have 2 crafted beers on tap, SanTan Devil's Ale and an Orange blossom. I know the Devil's Ale is good as I have had it, as I had to go back to work after lunch, I refrained from washing my pizza down with a cold beer... I know sadface at having to be a responsible adult. So I got a drink which was 1.95, it looks like they only have one size. However, their drink choices are excellent, I made an Arnold Palmer with their Black Tea and Raspberry lemonade, it was darn good.  I had the Jasper Mod sized with pepperoni, olives, and sun dried tomatos added on it was around 11 dollars for the pizza. It was flavorful, filling, and cooked to perfection. One co-worker got the Seasonal \"The Winston\" some weird concoction of something with cauliflower and other items and she said it was great, it didn't look appealing to me, but she wolfed it down, it was a small. Another got the Tristan which not only looked good, but tasted good as well. And finally another had the Jasper as well with pepperoni and banana peppers/Pepperoncis added to it. Everyone enjoyed their food and had a nice time.   All in all a nice addition to the area surrounding it! So many great places to choose from all in one spot! Parking is gawdawful during lunch time, but I won't dock a star for that, now if only they delivered. Maybe they could team up with the Jimmy Johns across the parking lot for delivery...mmmm!  The staff was friendly, funny, and got along well with each other. I will definitely give this pizza another whirl! You could sit inside or outside and the outside had some nicely shaded tables. Another plus was that they served your pizza to you on an actual plate!"}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good, but the quality has been falling since our first visit back in November, primarily that the crust isn't being cooked for as long. The crust on our last few pizzas have been very soft. Multiple times the online orders haven't been totally correct. My most recent visit I ordered online and the pickup time was for 6:47 pm. I arrived at 6:45 and the pizzas were still being prepared, they weren't even in the oven. It seems like the staff is simply there for get a paycheck and could care less."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and had high expectations when I walked in and then it all just went downhill from there.  Long line to stand in as you have a way overcrowded pizza bar area where 3 times as many employees as should be standing there make your pizza.    No one asks if you have been here or know what to do.  Once through the line it isn't clear if you stand and wait, someone brings it out or how long it might take.  After watching realize they scream your name and you retrieve your za. After about 15 minutes 2 of my 3 pizzas were done.  10 minutes later, or more, I finally go and ask about the 3rd pizza.  It is randomly produced 2 minutes later with burnt edges and barely cut through.   After sitting idle this whole time watching the scene behind the counter you have one employee running around like crazy cutting pizza and yelling names and then the other 12 employees are standing behind the counter chatting with each other and obviously getting all of the pizzas out of line order to go in the oven.    Looks like some additional employee training is needed.  Hopefully that happens as the pizza isn't terrible, or probably wouldn't be if it wasn't burnt."}
{"text":"Wow this pizza was awesome! I love that they have 3 sizes. A mini (think a kids size), a regular (what you can expect from the other pizza chains like this one), and a mega size. Price is based on size only, get as many toppings as you want! Build your own, go with one of their creations, or half and half. I highly recommend their seasonal creation right now, the \"kasey\". It had Gorgonzola, red onion, bacon, Brussels sprouts, and balsamic fig glaze. Soooo delicious! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I was able to call in and have my pizza ready for pickup.  However, the pizza itself was just OK -- I wouldn't eat here again because there are better places for pizza.    They do have a lot of choices for toppings and you create your own pizza every time -- order like a yogurt bar -- view toppings through a window and they cook it up just the way you want.    It was expensive for the size, though."}
{"text":"Mod is open really late so that is an amazing opportunity to come get your pizza on and load on all the toppings. They're open till 11 PM which is later than most places. I come here and I get the vegetarian pizza which includes a combination of white sauce, pesto sauce, most of all the vegetables. And then I add in the garlic butter on the top with a side of fig reduced sauce.  Satisfying every time!"}
{"text":"Always great pizza! Was and fresh and you get anything on it, no additional fees for adding on toppings. Wonderful place and always great service!"}
{"text":"We found our new pizza place. Loved especially all the toppings you can put on your pizza and make it your own way  Oh and carmalized pear tea was so good."}
{"text":"A bunch of us ordered some 11 \" pizzas and they were all really good! Among them were a few Mad dogs and a few Lucy Sunshines. Everyone enjoyed them, great crispy crust. The Lucy Sunshines felt a little light on cheese. The garlic strips were the biggest disappointment, very flat and unappetizing, to be honest---like a flat pizza crust with some garlic and cheese thrown on top . We went to Little Caesar's after that and ordered some garlic cheese bread to make up for it. We would definitely order the pizzas again, just make sure to ask for cheese on the Lucys!"}
{"text":"Such great service!!! They made sure our order was right and the pizza came out fast and delicious.  People checked on us to make sure we were doing good, and then as we were finishing up our pizza they brought us a DELISH cinnamon sugar pizza on the house  amazing, delicious place. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Mike Aerosmith and is Pizza Crew make some great pies.    Go get your pizza the way you want it.   Quick and taste!"}
{"text":"Talk about doing it your way! If you are picky about what you want in your salad or on your pizza, this is the place for you. Pick your veggies and meats, as many as you want for the SAME price. Thank you whoever came up with this great idea! The staff behind the counter were all very helpful. More importantly they seemed very happy working here and with each other. Great salad!! I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a visit from out of town; was really impressed! The process of making your own pizza is easy, the toppings are fresh and delicious, and the price is reasonable. Definitely wish we had one back home."}
{"text":"I love the awesome selection of toppings! I can't remember the last time I saw fresh cilantro as a topping option at a pizza place. I was so excited to load my pizza up with nearly every fresh vegetable and herb that they had, plus red sauce, pesto, and two kinds of cheese. I got the regular sized pizza, and I'd typically try to save a few slices of this size for a separate meal -- but this time I devoured the whole thing in one sitting. No shame; totally worth it. I also got the caramelized pear iced tea (free with check-in) which was so delicious! Next time (and there WILL BE a next time), I'd love to try their local wine which they have on tap for only $5 a glass! Steal!"}
{"text":"This location just opened up. It is in a convenient area by the freeway and is very close to our home. The staff are always welcoming with big smiles on their faces ready to take your order. Food is fresh, it's clean and you get what you pay for. I was surprised that they don't charge you for adding any additional toppings or sauces to your pizza so when you order definitely take advantage and ask for double or triple toppings to make your pizza even more delicious. The lemonade they have is amazing."}
{"text":"The pizza is really good! It's overpriced and takes a while, but I can't complain about the food!"}
{"text":"I brought my parents here. They are the type of parents who are super foodie snobs, my mom used to have her own catering business. Nothing, usually satisfies them unless it is full of flavor and it MUST BE HOT when served or my Dad will walk out.   So, understandably, I was nervous to say the least. We walked in and there was hardly a line luckily because my parents were starving. My Dad immediately told me to order for him. Yikes! Luckily, I am just as picky as him and knew what he would like. My Mom, however, stuck around and did her own ordering. I ordered the works, piled on the meats and veggies and cheese. The pizzas came out piping hot! Already Mod was going to have happy customers. I got some cheese to sprinkle on top and some crushed red pepper because that's the way they like their food. While I grabbed the water, I told them to go ahead and start eating. When I returned, they were consumed with eating the pizza. Seee, I told you! I don't go to eat at sub par places, I told him. We had so much pizza left over we ended up taking it home and they had it for lunch the next day. Great prices and fresh ingredients and most of all, hot food! Thank you Mod for making me look amazing!"}
{"text":"I came by right after they finished making pizzas for training and they let me try a few slices and I must admit it was very tasty! Especially one slice that had double the crust because the crust itself was very good! The ingredients were all fresh and tasty! The Manager there and employees were very nice and I plan to come back once they finally open Friday!  *honestly really awesome pizza!"}
{"text":"Always great pizza and customer service restaurant is clean. Great choices and the ability to customize your pie is awesome."}
{"text":"I was very surprised at how good this place is. People were nice, clean facility and pretty good pizza."}
{"text":"Staff r very friendly at this one, at least the guy that helped me was. I love the texture of their crust! I created my own typical red sauce roasted garlic spicy sausage bacon and veggies. I'd like to try something different next time. Maybe barbeque sauce cilantro and whatever else sounds good. Place was clean. I was there around 10:45."}
{"text":"They weren't on their game today. Lots of bubbles and burnt crust. I love their crust and the pizza is usually really good. Today's is good but there are voids of toppings because of the bubbles."}
{"text":"Their pizza is pretty good but the service is just ok. They always treat me  like I'm annoying them when I take a moment to choose my toppings. The regular crust is good, the gluten free is terrible -- especially if you reheat it (soft like a pita and doesn't crisp up). I don't think I'm going there again."}
{"text":"Lizzie and Philippe are the by far the best!!!! So welcoming, even at closing!!!!! Great upbeat environment!!!! Great prices too!!!"}
{"text":"I love their pizza! Great quality and you can add as much ingredients as you want (oh and I do). Always fresh and tasty. The crust is thin and crisp how I like it!! Price is a little more than it should be so I don't go as often as other places.   They seem to give me a bad look when I ask for extra veggies...... they have to it's their job so get over it lol"}
{"text":"Great food with fresh ingredients. Super friendly staff and great service!"}
{"text":"Went to MOD pizza for my very first time on Sunday afternoon around 1pm. The place was clean. The set up reminds me of Chipotle. You tell them what you want on your pizza and they build it for you.   They have so many options that it is overwhelming. Haha the ingredients were pretty fresh except for the arugula. It was a little wilted and brown.  I asked the lady if they had a certain seasoning and she said no and looked at me as if I was insane. Okay, thanks lady. The dough boy and the cashier were really nice, though :) They had interesting beverage options that I will have to try next time. (Pear tea I'm coming for you.)  The pizza was good. The crust was nice and crunchy and thin. The Caesar salad had a little bit too much dressing for my personal tastes. A mini pizza and a mini Caesar cost me $10.  I would return to MOD :)"}
{"text":"To start we ordered are pizza online at 4:15 and had a 5 pick up time. When I showed up at 5 my ticket was still in the printer. My order was never even started. Worst of all there was not a person in the place. Waited another 20 min for the pizza to be done. Got the pizza home and can not understand all the 5 stars this place has horrible pizza. Crust was not even cooked all the way and cheese was funky. Had people in town and they all had one piece and stated the pizza is terrible. Had to throw it out no one at it.This place is the McDonald's of take out pizza. Head to fired pie for a better fast food pizza."}
{"text":"Clean and neat place. I would say it is average, not special pizza. I liked that they have an option for a mini pizza."}
{"text":"Excellent variety of toppings for you pizza and a deal it is! I can easily share a pizza with my coworkers and get a salad for lunch to tie me over until a late dinner. The flavored tea beverages are not the norm and excellent."}
{"text":"Great pizza! I've been to this location several times and the pizza is always good. The staff is friendly and the place is clean. I tend to eat the same pizza every time but it's always good so no need to change things up!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Becky was so awesome and helped us create the best pizzas ever. (The honey chipotle sauce was sooo good). Everyone there is super nice and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Love it. It's a Subway but for pizza and its 100x better than Subway. You can choose a mini, mod or mega size pizza (for family sharing) and unlimited toppings. Seriously, it's unlimited. Want some extra chicken? You got it. It's free. Need extra pepperoni? It isn't an extra $3 so get it.  It is made to order, too which makes it as fresh as it can get. The fire oven is really neat and their drink selection is awesome. They have a few local brews, excellent milk shakes, an awesome selection of soft drinks and lemonades, too.  And what about the price? It won't break the bank. For an entire pizza, it cost me about $8. Not bad at all.  Friendly and fast service, very clean, very very happy. Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"I decided to try MOD Pizza after seeing the excellent reviews on YELP.    The place was everything my fellow YELPERS said it was.   - Clean  - Very friendly staff - when I entered I was greeted right away. When I walked up to towards the counter and stood looking at the menu on the wall, I was asked if it was my first time, and then the ordering process was briefly explained to me. I found the staff to be friendly, efficient and helpful.   - Good value - I had the standard size pizza (they also have a mini version) as well as the \"strips\" with four dipping sauces to sample. Along with a fountain drink my total was just over $13. Much less without the strips, but I wanted to try the sauces.  - Delicious food! - I loved the \"made on order\" pizza, and the ability to pick each and every ingredient I wanted (and even how much of each I wanted!). In that way, it's rather like Subway.    The way it works, there is one flat price for the pizza based on size, regardless of which and how many ingredients you add. You can literally ask for every single ingredient they have, all the meats, all the cheeses, the veggies, the spices, and it's still the same price as if you just had a plain cheese pizza.  Anyway, this is now my go-to pizza place when I'm in Goodyear (which is cool, because that's where I work!).  Try it, I am sure you won't be sorry you did."}
{"text":"I tried Mod Pizza for the first yesterday and was pleasantly surprised. I walked in about 7:30 in the evening and was promptly greeted with a warm hello. The staff were very friendly and upbeat.  I ordered my pizza and 3 minutes later was eating a very delicious perfectly prepared pizza. The pricing is good and service top notch. I will be a frequent diner here. Good job Mod Pizza"}
{"text":"I have never written a review but I am amazed by the customer service!! It was exceptional and heartfelt!!! Everything was great food and service! So kind I hope they're ok with us coming in all the time!!!  Judy Rosenow"}
{"text":"My son and I go here about twice a month. Always tastes great and haven't had a single complaint."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. Staff was very friendly and service was quick. :)  Top your pizza up for a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Was wanting to try this place because it was new. I called to order a \"medium\" pizza and I wanted half meat and half veggies but the person was incompetent when taking my order. When I got the pizza it was a small ad when I asked if it was a medium I was told yes. The pizza was ok. Probably won't go back again."}
{"text":"Went in last night about 8pm, place was pretty empty but I just dont think many know this place has opened yet.  Staff was very friendly and helpful being our first time.  Everything looked fresh and it was hard to decide what toppings to get, since you can have them all if you want at no additional charge!! We decided on pepperoni, mushrooms and olives and red sauce. It was actually very good.  We also got the cinnamon sticks which is the same dough used for the pizza but smaller and has cinnamon and sugar on top, with your choice of chocolate, strawberry and cinnamon dipping sauce. We didnt have a drink but did look at the homemade lemonade and the Marion Blackberry Lemonade along with regular iced tea and a carmelized pear tea that I wish to try next time.  They do offer salad.....but why ;)"}
{"text":"This was my first visit. The staff is friendly, they were very proactive to inform me of the menu choices. The pizza was good, you get a 10 inch, thin crust pizza for about 8 bucks. But to be honest, For just a couple of bucks more, I can get more bang for my buck at any other pizza place."}
{"text":"Just opened yesterday figured we try it.  Kind of like Fired pie.  Crust is thin, had good flavor. You get to pick any toppings you want. My husband ordered meat and they were not stingy. There was allot of meat on his pie.  I like cheese and I had roasted garlic.  They have pesto that might never my next try. Nice casual atmosphere. They have beer , soda. Salads."}
{"text":"There pizza was very good but the garlic sticks were burnt so I wasn't able to eat them. But I would definitely go back for the pizza."}
{"text":"Love this place! I was so excited to try your place because it's right around the corner from my house. I've been waiting for it to open and I was not disappointed. Normally I'm a fan of Blaze but I love the this crust pizza and the toppings they have. They even have vegan cheese and brussel sprouts! When you come in they say hello and when you leave they say bye. The energy is magnetic and the staff seem happy to there!"}
{"text":"A few 100 feet from Pie Five. Almost identical biz models aside from a few minor differences.  MOD restaurant is clean & nice, the employees are also nice, polite & helpful.  This was my 1st visit. I remember my 1st visit with pie5, I wasnt too thrilled w/for 2 reasons. You slap 10 toppings on your pizza but you only get a smidgen of each. Sort of defeats the purpose. If I want olives...id like more then 5 small olives scattered about...for the most part, every bite should have a portion of all your toppings or close...If you take a 2nd and third bite, but still havent seen an olive, again, it defeats the purpose of this biz model. and after eating, I was not even slightly filled up.Nowadays, almost every pizza place is offering an xtra large, with any toppings for $9.99 and the others all offer a 3 topping large for around $7.99' & others a lrg is $5/ $6.00.  With that said, after my 1st visit to pie 5, I gave them another shot & am now a regular. Use ur mouth...tell the person, 'LOAD IT UP'..or say 'normal olive....heavy peppers...etc'....Big difference .Every pie 5 pizza since has been gr8. This biz model is gr8 if ur by urself or maybe with a co-worker, one kid, a friend etc.....But with both pie 5/MOD being priced as they are me, another adult and 3 kids is like $60-$90 depending.   Thats a bit pricey, imo.  Mod pizza does serve beer and wine, but 4 glasses of beer for 3 adults, just waitin 12 min was close to $30 after tip....  I liked mods's pizza. I do wish they had other crust options, but their thin crust is just fine. A previous reviewer called it a 'stale cracker'. I wouldnt say that...it was thin...as all 'thin crusts' are going to be thin..I also didnt think it tasted like a stale cracker...tasted fresh to me.  My gripe with mod vs pie5= when I went in for my 1st visit to MOD I literally said 'OK, me, my kids, family friends & etc all like pie 5.Im the guinea pig...convince me with this order that your as good or better then pie 5 & I will be giving my opinion to a bunch of others'...  The polite young lady replied 'No disrespect to pie 5, they have a good product...but ours is better'....  OK....with all that I was thinking they will make sure this order is as good as it can be.  And it was good...My only gripe is even after saying the above, It felt like my 1st visit at pie5 where they would go very very light on the toppings....But I learned...all visits to pie5 since, I say 'lite this, regular that, heavy on this'....and all is perfect.  Watching the girl at MOD put such minimal toppings on I said 'look, if I say heavy, please go heavy...5 slices of mushroom scattered is not going to get it'....She said 'yes sir, we have to go light cause we only use a thin crust that can only hold so much, but when we are done you will have the opportunity to add more of any item you would like more of'....  OK, that sounded fine/reasonable...  Yet when I was done, & while I do like alot of toppings, im not expecting lbs of mushrooms, olives etc...just enough so each bite has some goodies & I can actually taste the toppings, rather then a few small pieces of olives or mushroom scattered throughout the whole pizza, which is lost & you'd never know they were on there....(this is essentially the exact pizza I order at pie 5 on most occasions), I said 'ok, is this the time I say please add more mushrooms, olives etc..?'..  The young lady (very nice & polite) said \"we cant put on much more of anything....the thin crust wont handle it & we will not serve you a product we deem unfit\"......  Okaaay then..Very nice & appreciate the honesty. But your running a biz whose main model/marketing is '1 price, any & all toppings you want'...But then your told they cant do more? Honestly the pizza was not loaded or close to it....pie 5, can get 2 or 3x's more stuff in theirs, including their thin crust....  All in all, I thought the pizza was good. Service was excellent.Nice looking place..Well worth a try.  Food Etc : All veggies, meat & etc..were fresh, all looked fresh, all were presented nicely & tasted fresh. They had alot of employees. Bins were kept full..Crust...Its thin, but good. Sauces- cant speak for others....But the regular marinara, which they will give you some in a side container as well in the final steps, was actually quite good-one of the best 'chain sauces' in this area & good sauces...Good marinara's go a long way in determining peoples analysis of whether 'was it good? real good? not good?'.  It will be interesting to watch things play out between Pie5 & MOD....Pretty normal to see a Mcd's, Next to a Burger King, Next to Wendys. Hardees etc...But I dont know w/these 2.   Gonna be hard for both to succeed so close together..I can see both chains doing well, but not like this, side by side in a market thats big, but is still a pimple on an elephants azz in the grande scheme.  Both have good points, all mostly good.. I rec u check out both & go w/the one u prefer.You wont be sorry for either."}
{"text":"Fitchburg's own MOD pizza! It is hard to see from the main road but it next to Panera bread.  I just had to come in after my wonderful experience in Seattle.   I walked in the door and HI's were everywhere. Makes you feel so welcome. Most ingredients look fresh. A couple of vege looks wilted but still good, I.e wrinkled but not brown or black.   I built my own pizza but they have many to choose from.   Wifi is available but needs a password so just ask one of the staff. I'm not sharing that here so you need to come in and say hi to the friendly team.   Place is clean. Decor looks hip. Music is so fun, I just wanna stay there for the whole day. I really don't know what else to say of this place. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Like other have said, it's the chipolte of pizza.  Awesome concept and the pizza is made really quick"}
{"text":"This brick oven pizza is great. Fast, cheap and delicious. Everyone can pick their own toppings which are fresh. 1 price  for everything."}
{"text":"Decent pizza. Not as crisp as I would of liked. Super super slow pizza toppers. Waited 15 minutes in line with only one couple ahead of us. Not ideal for lunch in a hurry"}
{"text":"Wow!   Coming back to Phoenix and having Mod and it's even better than before! This is the best pizza i have ever had. Love it!  Cheers to the owners of this awesomeness!!!"}
{"text":"Easy, good anytime pie! They also sell Mexican Coke! I love this place. Very simple, clean, friendly and very tasty for a quick meal. Their crust is really good over other competitors.   Also, my son has Celiac and he loves their GF pizza. You just need to make sure they handle it correctly."}
{"text":"I love this place! My husband and I share a pizza and it's totally fulfilling at a completely reasonable price. It's always busy but yet you never have to wait very long for your food and it's always clean"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. This location has several women that seem to be higher than a kite and another female to just doesn't seem to understand that I can add whatever I want on my salad. We eat at mod in Queen Creek 2x a week and there service is amazing however I've tried here at Recker 3x and all 3 have been a shit show experience. My entire office will not be back."}
{"text":"CUSTOM PIZZA! No extra charge for unlimited toppings, people! Do you like to have 10 different meats on your pizza? Is broccoli pizza your jam? Are you lactose and looking for a dairy free cheese? Then MOD Pizza is the place for you. This place is really phenomenal for take out or dine in pizza. The fact that you can get as many toppings you want for the same price is totally awesome. They offer dairy-free cheese, gluten free crust, 16 different vegi toppings, huge selection of different meats and cheeses, and offer great sauces like pesto, alfredo, bbq, marinara, etc. It's so fun to customize your pizza with the help of their super nice staff. I got chatting with one of the staff members, he told us the hottest part of the oven gets to be 800(F) degrees! Now that is pretty amazing. Their service is always fast and friendly, and they do a great job of keeping both their inside and outside seating clean. Totally recommend this place if you have dietary restrictions, want something very specific, or just simply LOVE PIZZA!"}
{"text":"We love the pizza but the service is really bad. Get our order wrong or forget to make it altogether. No one seems concerned when they mess up. Recommend the location at San Tan."}
{"text":"The gluten free pizza is so delicious! I Have been her 2 times in less than a week! So yummy! It's the \"subway\" of pizza! How can you go wrong? Great job MOD PIZZA!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza,  excellent service, and fast!!!!! Staff is very courteous and greet you when you walk in. MOD pizza and a soft drink just over $11 and they offer a public service discount ( military, police,  fire fighter)"}
{"text":"Pretty yummy \"build your own\" pizza and salad at flat rate prices. Service was great, ingredients are fresh, they have sweet treats, beer and wine. Can't ask for anything more. Prices are very reasonable.   I'm so happy that they opened this place right around the corner from my house. The hubby and I decided to give this a try for dinner. This is now on my family's \"places to eat\" spot.   I've read some peoples' negative reviews about the long wait or something - you want cooked pizza, right? Personally, the waiting time was not bad at all. Had a to go order and was in and out of there within 25 mins. There were plenty of customers in there."}
{"text":"Never heard of this place, but very glad I was introduced to MOD.  I picture MOD as someone saying... I know lets combine the good parts from Sauce/Mellow Mushroom and the few good parts from Chipotle and create a new franchise.    So basically order any pizza you want with as many toppings as you want, you are only charged one price for the base type and size.   GF and Dairy Free friendly (but not a GF or DF environment).   Line up, choose your base/toppings from featured flavors or just choose adhoc as you progress down the line.  Great concept.  So many sauce options, cheese/meat/veggie options to choose from.  Ordering is done quickly and the MOD team work really well together.    Busy busy place!     The only draw back is that MOD needs a bigger (or another oven).  Takes about 10-15 minutes to cook once you've paid and taken a seat.   This is taking in consideration that your pizza will go into a queue as I don't believe it takes more than 3-5 minutes to cook.. so a little bottleneck there.  Hopefully not too much of a deterrent for people this isn't fast food, it is GOOD food delivered well.      Don't feel you can eat everything in one go?  They place togo boxes right where they drinks center is.    Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Great pizza, at a great price!  The managers are very nice as were the rest of the employees. pizza is delicious, freshly made, good crust...multiple toppings at the same price is a major plus! (They don't skimp on the toppings) I'm a huge fan of Venezia just down the road, but this place has become my new favorite!"}
{"text":"Dined in twice and got take out once, it was very good. You order your food at a counter and wait for it there as well. Create your own salads or pizzas or menu items. Good for a quick lunch or take out. Not fancy but food is fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, sometimes really bad service though. They can be stingy with toppings and if you ask them to load it up you get one or two guys that do but with the rest of the 'can you add more?...a little more... Really?? come on' over all we really like the place but wish the service was consistent and that employees weren't stoned and off in a daze."}
{"text":"This location is located near an office park - sorta hard to see from the road. The service is stellar, the food is delicious and the establishment is clean. I highly recommend MOD pizza - best thin crust pizza around!"}
{"text":"The first time that I went, it was delicious flavorful and a delight to have based on what you want on your pizza.   Unfortunately, the second time around was not appealing.  What makes matters worse is that the order was made online.  I can understand if this was a phone order but it wasn't.  When I received the order and brought it home,  all five of my orders were shuffled.  A topping here a topping there similar to someone playing find the shell in a cup.    To put the nail on the coffin, I called to speak to the manager and he stated what do you want me to do about it?  Um how about reinbursement for a product that didn't satisfied me at all.  All he did was take my name and said his manager will get back which is a long gone in the garbage.    I will never do business with this place again.  I could understand a pizza that was off but the service to resolve this did not meet my expectations at all."}
{"text":"My husband and I along with our two toddlers tried this place today and we were not disappointed. It was our first time ever eating at a MOD and the workers were really friendly about explaining how it all works which is important with a place where you build your own. The pizza was delicious and the ingredients tasted fresh. I also had a salad that was great. The food came out really quick which is always a plus. The price is good, the service is good and the food is good. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I loved my pizza. What I wasn't a fan of was the employee that didn't change her gloves at all in the 30 some odd pizzas she made while we were there. I don't eat meat and I watched her single handedly pick up every single piece of meat and explain it to some children in front of me (which was adorable, don't get me wrong) but that was after we had been in line for 25 minutes for delicious pizza. I didn't order any toppings so that she wouldn't touch them because I hate being that person who has to mention that, that is seriously gross."}
{"text":"Here in Phoenix for the weekend and excited that there is a Modd Pizza next to our hotel!  Love the pizza!  1st tried it in Seattle!"}
{"text":"Feeling Peckish? Try MOD Pizza for around $10. We got a medium pizza or standard  for $7.50 and a drink. At MOD, they start with an awesome thin crust. It reminds me of the pizza I had with my mother when we were in Carbonara. Then choose from delicious and unusual fresh ingredients for toppings like caramelized Brussels Sprouts, sun-dried tomatoes, and roasted peppers. My daughter wanted a \"regular\" pizza, so we stuck to tomato sauce, cheeses, ground beef, bacon and mild sausage. They put they pizza into the oven. In a flash, voila! Delicious pizza that has that slight oven char. Their blackberry lemonade is zippy and fruity. They old-fashion lemonade is tangy. I also liked their vintage tea. Use your imagination and mix your own tea lemonade. We had a great time. Service is friendly, too."}
{"text":"Tried MOD Pizza on a whim. Line was long (good sign) but moved very quickly. We were waited on in less than 5 mins from getting in line. Loved the choices, unlimited toppings, salads were fantastic. Overall- very happy with our first visit. We will be back."}
{"text":"I come here a lot. So much that they already know what I want when I walk in. Food is amazing every single time! Staff is very nice and friendly. Plenty of places to sit and you never have to worry about a table being dirty, they are on top of there game here. Every aspect of this place knocks it outta the park. Come see for yourself!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Great fresh tasting salads and pizza! We got 4 mod size pizza and 2 large salads, $40.00. We were 2 couples and we shared and sampled each other's pizza and shared our large salads with our spouses. And we each took home a pizza! You can pick as little or as many toppings you want, as well as the salad. You go down the line and let them know what you want. Trust me you won't have time enough to eat your salad before the pizza done!! Brick oven too!!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times and always with great experiences.  Today we went for lunch, it wasn't busy, so we decided to grab a pizza and a salad. My pizza was on its way in to the oven before I had an opportunity to ask for them to hold the mushrooms or ask for any toppings. I did ask for sun dried tomatoes, and the \"nice\" girl with short dark hair and black nose ring sighed heavily and put a few tomatoes on my pizza.  Again, there was NO LINE, it was not busy.....we've been there when it had been crazy busy and we've ALWAYS had great service with friendly people.  When our pizza was ready, we asked for the fig, balsamic glaze.....to be met with the deep sigh \"both of them!?\"  We will go back to MOD but I truly hope the girl who was having such a bad day can figure out how to not make her customers feel like they are intruding on her day."}
{"text":"Would I recommend: Yes! I do recommend. What I got: I get a Margarita pizza with extra basil.  What I like about the place: I love how nice the staff are, they're always so kind and they will greet you when you enter and say bye when you leave. I never had a bad experience here. The hours: 10:30-10PM"}
{"text":"Personal sized pizzas with whatever you want on it! I had a mozza, basil and no sauce. It was great. My husband had the sausage and kids had pepperoni. It was busy, but service was quick & atmosphere upbeat. Bathrooms were also super clean, which is always a plus. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love that you can request vegan options! Check out the Indian School location to meet Anna behind the counter. She is so friendly and just seems like an awesome person. Makes the visit even better."}
{"text":"If you want a personal pizza with a style come to Mod. It's affordable and tasty. Milkshakes are great and they serve alcohol too. Their lemonade and tea is good too. Outdoor seating and bike parking. Forget the other restaurants near by, come here!"}
{"text":"I love this concept of pizza meets Chipotle.  The price point is what has me in awe.  A single pizza cheaper than a happy meal from McDonald's and so so good.    You have any and every kind of pizza you want. It is quick and fast and the customer service is amazing.  Great job.     Remember no matter what you can not leave without a No Name Cake!"}
{"text":"this place is awesome! ! they have the best pizza, best service. employees are super friendly.  If you get a chance you should ask for Josh, he makes the most creative pizza !"}
{"text":"If you're a picky eater, have dietary restrictions, and like your pizza a certain way, mod pizza is for you! Mod allows you to choose whatever type of pizza you want, from the crust, to the sauce, to the cheese, to the toppings!   Great selection of toppings and they offer gluten free crust and dairy free cheese for those with food allergies. They even offer customizable salads if pizza is not what you're looking for   The only downside was the crust was pretty burnt on the bottom of the pizza."}
{"text":"We all have experience poor customer service and I myself have been in management for 4 years. The prime objective to being a leader is to lead by example. This was not the case at MOD pizza I have frequently visited this restaurant. Almost every time I have been there i see the same young lady on her cellphone while others are working. I have watched her poorly handle customer request and just look like she didn't want to be at work. I asked one of the employees on a recent visit who she was. To my surprise they told me she was the manager. This is why I opened with the comment I made. To the owner I would like to say I love your restaurant but I will not go when she is there. I know I am but only one loss for you but I feel the more people that see this the more that will point her out. You will continue to get my business just on the days and times she is not present. I find her rude and a very poor choice for management which I'm sure you had no idea of at the time of hiring. I do urge you to either have a talk with her or replace her before she gets you bad reviews. This is not a review on MOD as a restaurant but a review on the manager and her ability to manage.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Visiting a college nearby & stopped for a quick lunch before flying back home to California. We were greeted as soon as we walked in and all the employees were so friendly & helped us with what to order and what their favorites were. Latoya, especially, was so welcoming & kind. Super nice staff!!! On top of that, the food was DELICIOUS! We ordered a caesar salad, pizza, garlic strips, & cinnamon strips. All of the food was cooked perfectly & with just enough toppings. If you are in the area & looking for lunch or dinner, you must stop by!"}
{"text":"First time eating here was 3/12/16. The 5 of us all ordered a bunch of different toppings on our pizzas and devoured them! Burrrp, DELICIOUS!!!  The staff was polite and didn't make us leave even though we sat there for about an hour after we finished eating. I am definitely going back to this place. It's in a good location and you can't beat the price.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Very good in a pinch...fast, fresh, and made to order.  Excellent side salads and high quality ingredients.  Very affordable!  Pregnant wife was very happy!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. We come here often. My only complaint is trying to get them to give me enough ingredients. I like extra cheese and after the second time telling then I just give up. When people want extra PUT EXTRA! The last time we went the cheese wasn't out to the edges ( I will tell them if it happens again) and crust was burnt. An off night for sure, but we will go back."}
{"text":"We were so excited when we found out MOD was coming to our area! It did not disappoint! They have been open a month now , but still seem a little disorganized. They might have been short staffed, who knows, but it took awhile to get through the line-for everyone. Our pizzas were a little more than charred- practically black underneath. However, being fairly new I can forgive these things and the pizza was pretty good. I know we will be regulars and within a month or two they will get it dialed in and get their 5th star."}
{"text":"Had awesome service last night! Super helpful and upbeat employee and delicious pizza! It's a great deal and has unlimited toppings!"}
{"text":"I've really had great experiences at MOD so far. Is it Pomo quality pizza? Of course not but sometimes you just need a tasty, quick pie. Maybe a salad. And a milkshake for good measure.  The menu options are yummy but it's fun to go rogue and build your own too. Huge fan of the Lucy Sunshine and a Caesar salad. This place is family friendly, casual, and has very helpful staff members. Good little addition to our area."}
{"text":"OMG by far one of my favorite pizza and salad places. The service is great, friendly staff, customer service is excellent! Staff greets you as you walk in the door, and if you've never been there the staff will walk you through the line and explain each section to you. Given today was super busy and line was long but that didn't stop the staff along with the manger helping out n getting all customers through the line rather fast. The staff n manager were apologizing to each customer for the wait but it didn't seem like a long wait. Granted it seem there was an event going on and the number of people there I felt all staff did a great job getting customers down the line pretty fast. It's a very family oriented place. It's very clean and neat, I've never seen it messy or trashy, I've been in at all different times of the day. I've recommended friends, family and even coworkers to eat here and they all have loved it!! I'd say you must check it out if you've never been here, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I wasn't a fan of this pizza. There wasn't much flavor, and the crust was too thin.  There are only 2 size options, 6\" and 11\". I felt the pizza was overpriced for the size. The toppings weren't plentiful either but I did like the pesto sauce. They also don't offer slices.   I can't see myself going back."}
{"text":"Best gluten free pizza crust I have had! I love it and that I can add whatever variety of toppings I want!  4 stars because I wish there were more than one size of gluten free crust. But the service is excellent!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite Personalized pizza place! Okay I may be biased because MOD started in my hometown of Seattle but still it's the best!   The service is so nice and friendly and treat you like a friend. They are quick and efficient!   I love that MOD allows you to add unlimited toppings for one standard price! You can either follow their suggested menu pizzas or make one that exactly fits your taste! The pizza is always cooked to perfection. Not too doughy and not burnt!   They also have beer on tap and a selection of bottled beers, wines, and other juices/soda.   I'm sad there won't be a MOD where I'm moving in Dallas, TX"}
{"text":"This place is sooooo good. I love the concept of being able to build my pizza and salad however I want! Today, I got red sauce, mozzarella, Canadian bacon, bacon, chicken, pineapple, jalapeños and olive on one half. It was the best pizza I ate. We also go a salad. I thought the size of the salad in comparison to the pizza was small for the same price but I would probably still get a salad from here again. Tonight they had blackberry lemonade and it was delicious. I would definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try out MOD after receiving a coupon for a free pizza in the mail. Like another reviewer, I really wanted to like it. The restaurant itself looks very charming and I really liked the idea that you could get as many toppings as you wanted for a flat charge. However, MOD Pizza failed to meet expectations in almost every regard.  The food - While I anticipated that the pizza would be small (we ordered two), a regular sized pizza would be considered a personal pizza almost anywhere else. The dough was extremely thin and chewy. To their credit, the toppings themselves tasted very fresh and were plentiful. They were however extremely light handed with them. We also ordered cinnamon strips with cinnamon sauce. They were in a word, flavorless. They were made from the same thin dough as the pizza, and they were lacking in any type of moisture.  Not even the dipping sauce (which was very good) could save them. It was like eating cardboard.  The atmosphere - The moment you (or any other customer for that matter) walk in the door, you hear a chorus of \"hello\" and the moment you or any other customer leave, you hear a chorus of \"thank you\". After one of two people, it became extremely annoying. The ordering process is also rather cumbersome. As a first time guest, there is no direction or signage indicating that your pizza would be made assembly style. We instinctively walked up to the register to order. What's more, there were far too many people in the kitchen area than what was necessary. There had to be at least 5 people on the assembly line alone. One person put on the sauce, who then passed it to another person to put on the cheese. You also had to order all of your items in this line, even if it was a side that required no assembly. I mistakenly didn't order the cinnamon strips while in line and instead ordered them at the register. The cashier very rudely asked me if I had already ordered them, and if not I needed to get back in line to do so. As I found out, ordering them simply entailed writing my name on a piece of paper under some dough. Service was otherwise OK. Not great.   I can safely say we probably would never go back. Not even order online. That would require having to go in to pay, and to hear that chorus of hello and goodbye again. That alone makes me not want to go back. The cinnamon strips however were the clincher. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I had a friend that was ranting and raving about this place so I decided to give it a try. I've seen a few of these pizza places popping up and after trying Pieology I wasn't about to try another place like this. She bribed me with a giftcard he had and so we went. Walking in you could instantly tell this was an upbeat fast paced vibe. I had no idea what I wanted but they were so kind and patient with me!  I went ahead with the BBQ chicken pizza and their MOD size was perfect! I did have leftovers and who doesn't love leftover cold pizza?!?  The cleanliness of the restaurant was very clean. I was impressed by that since it was during their evening rush. The service was fast and friendly.  Last but not least, the food was GOOD! Very tasteful and flavorful. I will most definitely refer others and go back again."}
{"text":"30 minutes from entering until I got my pizza. It actually tasted pretty good but I would't come by again if I was in a rush."}
{"text":"I couldn't finish my food- it was not good. I like the concept of these places, but maybe their menu is poorly curated? I'm not sure. The flavor combos were not great on my salad."}
{"text":"My second visit at MOD but first visit at this location. I love how the pizzas and salads are made fresh. I love their Caesar Salad with roasted garlic! So good!!   The staff is friendly and the prices are fair. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I am a regular MOD costumer. I travel for a living and can always count on MOD for a good dinner and a great pizza salad. But this MOD wanted to charge me separate for the pizza and the salad because I requested no cheese and red sauce.  And not nicely. Never coming back to this MOD."}
{"text":"It was late, right before close, me and my son had to pick up food before everything closed. They still took the time to be nice, talk with us, make great suggestions, and prepaid great food!"}
{"text":"Outstanding. Thin crust pizza with unlimited great choice of toppings. Excellent value. This is our third visit.  Will be coming back regularly."}
{"text":"It's like the subway of pizza. Build your own pizza how ever many toppings you want no additional price. It's thin pizza and one of my new favorite places. It's close, the price is low and it tastes great. Try it !!!"}
{"text":"There are tons of make your own personalized pizza places in the valley....  However Mod Pizza has a TON more of choices to add on your pizza that others don't. They also know how to cook their pizzas - no burnt and not under cooked pizzas here!  All the staff is always super friendly and does an awesome job!  Can I mention if you're an Ice cube lover --- they have the BEST ice!!!!   The pizzas are reasonably priced and soooooo good!  I've had their salads and desserts as well - they were delicious too, but my stomach votes for the pizza!  Come make your own pizza - pre-order it online even and pick up!"}
{"text":"The Pizza is extremely tasty and the service has been better than 100% on all three of the occasions I stopped in for lunch."}
{"text":"Great food for cheap.   Only thing is not a fan of how they make you feel obligated to tip due to having the tip section on your receipts."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Yelp and knew we had to check it out. The best part about this place is that they don't charge for toppings. You just choose your size of pizza and just go to town! They have some topping combos that can help you decide because they do have a lot of toppings.   The inside of the restaurant is spacious with lots of seating indoors and a few tables outside. Their decor is nice and soothing. It wasn't very load inside either. You can carry on a normal conversation without yelling (like other places).  Tons of parking in the parking lot. You can always park really close to the place.  The staff was great. This was our first time and they walked us though the process. They had enough staff available to make sure customers got the attention they need, which I am very grateful for.   I highly recommend this place. Come and check it out!"}
{"text":"Best variety of pizza I have ever had. Freshest ingredients and always made to my liking. I always have the best experience at Mod Pizza because the staff provide incredible customer service. On my second visit, I walked in and was greeted by my first name and asked if I wanted what I had last time. The staff remembered my name and my previous pizza order. Who does that?! I highly recommend them to everyone. For the price, I can't believe how great it tastes, and for the customer service, I am a Mod Pizza lover for life!"}
{"text":"MOD is our new favorite pizza place! We are always greeted with a smile and a \"welcome in\". Staff is friendly and efficient. The price is right and the options are endless. Anywhere we can get anything we want on our pizza for a set price, we are in! You can even get Brussel sprouts on your pizza! It's always quick and delicious. And they have ice cold local beer on tap! It's a win all the way around!"}
{"text":"Our family loves MOD! There is something for everyone there! Gluten free pizza (with a legit yummy dough), vegan cheese (doesn't taste that great, but really, how could it??), and salads. I love that each of my kids can customize what they want. The white sauce is a family favorite. I love to get a big salad just loaded with all the goods and their balsamic dressing is delish. The vibe here is always friendly and upbeat too! Great patio for dining in. We also do online ordering for pick up and it's super easy and convenient."}
{"text":"Wife and I decided to try it out. Her pizza was perfect but mine accidently came out burnt. Even burnt it still tasted good lol. They promptly replaced it though for me. Fast and friendly, can't ask for more. Ty"}
{"text":"New addition to my favorite pizzas! The reviews don't lie, this place is great. The service is wonderful and the pizza is fantastic. We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We loved the pizza very much! But the staff kept goofing off and messed our order up twice, and over charged us by $5."}
{"text":"After receiving a free pizza post card my husband and I decided to give mod a try. The restaurant itself has a modern and clean setup. Being our first time we opted for both a pizza and salad served on the thin pizza crust. The pizza was called Dominic it sounded like it was going to be very flavorful unfortunately it ended up bland and quite plain. A few pieces of sausage tomato and onion, the sauce tastes like canned Alfredo ragu with no seasoning. The salad was not much better it had no dressing so just tastes dry. The chicken and bacon were cold and also lacked flavor. We also ordered some garlic toast which was made 15 minutes after the rest of our food. Very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Always quick wait time, incredible pizza! Length of line may scare you, but know it moves pretty quick! And you get UNLIMITED toppings! So Fresh, so good! Best pizza joint in the Tukee in our opinion!"}
{"text":"Ok so I'm such a fan of Fired Pie so I had to try this place and I'm sold! Love the crust, all the ingredients are super fresh, no extra charge for extra toppings so that's awesome, mini, regular and large size, defiantly more food for your money.  Staff is super friendly, I have to say I prefer this place way more"}
{"text":"Cute place.  It's kind of like the Chipotle of pizza joints.  You go in, order a pizza, and they decorate it per your instructions using toppings that are right in front of you.  They bake it quick, and you are out of there in about 10 minutes.  You pay one price regardless of toppings.  Is it a gourmet experience?  Of course not.  But it's perfectly acceptable pizza.  There's much worse out there, believe me.  I'll take MOD over the \"big 3\" pizza franchises any day.  And it's much better than playing Russian roulette with delivery.  I've been here 3 times and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great pizza!! My husband and I shared the \"Mod\" sized pizza and we were able to pick what we wanted on our sides.  I had the marinara base with pesto and had the following toppings: pepperoni, spicy sausage, salami, olives, artichoke hearts,banana peppers, parmesan, and asiago cheese!! I did go a little overboard on the toppings but you get a little greedy when it's UNLIMITED TOPPINGS!!!!  With that said  the crust remained nice and crispy! We will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"First time to this location. The people working were friendly and helpful. Seemed like they were enjoying themselves. Clean tables and lots of seating.  I custom ordered mine with chicken, BBQ sauce, pineapple, artichokes and garlic. The cook them fresh with any typing you want. The pizza is thin crust and cooks pretty fast.   This is my new favorite pizza place. I will be back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I was lured in by the dairy/free cheese. So I passed up on a Nektar smoothie bowl only to go in place my order and her tell me the red sauce has Parmesan cheese in it then proceeded to asked if that was ok. Ummm I'll let her answer her own question. I walked out sadly to be let down after being excited for no reason. Couldn't go to Nektar anymore because they were closed. Just went back home. Wasted my time!"}
{"text":"Think Chipotle for Pizza! You order the size of pizza that you want and can add anything that you want to it, but the price remains the same. I LOVE that because if I had my way, I would have 10 toppings on my pizza every time! I loved that they had crumbled meatballs as a topping. They also have wine and beer on tap and a large, open patio that is perfect for this time of year! The pizza dough was cooked to bubbly perfection in a pizza oven. Since it is right around the corner from my house, i'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Good Made on Demand pizza. We all got what we wanted and it was great. They went a little light on the cheese (just shy of a measured scoop),  but it was still good. Pretty quick and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good. Pretty light on the cheese, they didn't even fill up their measuring spoon. Tables needed cleaning  and that's really annoying when you have to clean your own spot. ."}
{"text":"New location! Great idea. Great deal for being able to create your own pizza with whatever toppings you want.   My child loves it. He gets to add whatever topping is available and he can see it go in the brick oven. Pizzas are delicious ."}
{"text":"Location: Loop 202 & San Tan Village Pkwy. Excellent food, very friendly staff, and always a fun experience.  Never been disappointed and always deliver a 5 star experience.  Can't say enough good things about this place and its people. It can get very busy and very crowded but it's worth the wait.  I highly recommend this place.  Give yourself a little extra time, try to avoid the dinner rush if you are very hungry  and you will be rewarded with good service and great food.  Leave the crew a little extra cheddar, you'll see that they deserve it 100%  Definitely try the Caspian w/sweet hot peppers!  You'll thank me for it."}
{"text":"When you take the time and spend money to enjoy food from a restaurant or fast food, there are some expectation that you will be satisfied.  Especially from a great chain like MOD.  But for some reason, this Ocotillo and Arizona Ave location never fails to put a damper on my experience.  I've only been to two different location so I could not say how it is on the other locations.  100% perfect on one location but a total fail for this location. I just don't understand why for some reason, you have to beg to add more than five pieces of pepperoni on a MOD size, or get a pinch of sausage when you ask for more because they initially give you very little, or repeat every single ingredients of one of the menu items every time you order,  or have to grab a wad of napkins to wet so that I can clean a table and chairs to use. I know they have enough employees because of the amount of employees standing around chit chatting behind the counter with no active task at hand.   Don't get me wrong, the pizza is always good for the prize but I think this location can do a little more in regards to meeting the high expectations that the other MOD location set for their loyal customers.  I posted a picture so you'll see that it wasn't an unreasonable request. MOD size Caspian with sweet hot peppers.  To get to this finish product, had to asked for extra sausage twice (+2 pinch ), asked for extra sweet hot peppers (+3 pcs ), had to remind about the gargonzola cheese , had to ask for the BBQ swirl when I picked it up . The pepperoni pizza that is in the background, I had to answer my sons question on why they only gave him 5 pcs of pepperoni on a MOD size pizza (+3 pcs . Anyways. This is way too long than I intended to."}
{"text":"When entering the staff are friendly shouting out \"hello\" & \"welcome\". The line moves fast & there is a huge menu on the wall so you can decide what pizza & sides you want. The price is moderate and the food comes out really quick. They also have amazing chocolate shakes! If you're in the mood for a cocktail they have a small supply of beer/wine. Cute little spot!"}
{"text":"So, just a little story. My parents are older, mom loves the book store I'm in charge of dad in the wheel chair. Dad is thirsty, now I see MODs. Dad and I go in....it's two days before they open they aren't open for regular business, everyone busy. This nice young lady let's me know, now comes Mike. What do you want? Well just wanted like a ice tea and lemonade. \"Give me a moment\" not a minute later, there they were. I said what do I owe you? You can catch me later and drops down his card, so I thought. It was a card to try the pizza. Well, maybe a month and a half later, we go back to the book store and you guessed it I order the pizza, from Mike. I introduced myself, and he remembered myself and father. We got home, presentation fantastic, pizza was deliciousoo. I had trouble deciding, they looked so good, went with the \"Dominic\". It seems the most popular are\"Caspian\" & \"Mad Dog\". Whatever you pick it will be better than good.    P.S. They have many, many toppings to make your own  deliciousoo!"}
{"text":"Thanks to the team today for providing a free meal to introduce themselves to the neighborhood.  Welcome to South Tempe! For the review: The salad pizza was very good.  I tried it with pesto...very tasty, I would suggest putting the meat you want on the pizza part of the salad/pizza to get a nice roast on it before you add it back to the salad. I like the flavored tea also...caramel somthing"}
{"text":"I love this location so much! Not only is the food delicious (made to order pizza is a beautiful thing for picky eaters like me!), but the service is top notch. Ricky is one of the best, most down-to-earth managers I have ever met at any restaurant. He knew both mine and my boyfriend's names by the end of our first visit and truly makes an effort to get to know every single one of his customers. I've never waited in line for longer than eight minutes (even one that almost goes out the door) and I've never been disappointed by the food quality or store cleanliness. I'd continue to go back to MOD simply for the pizza and cinnamon sticks alone, but Ricky has made it impossible for me to go to any other location but this one!"}
{"text":"Freaking great.  Had a guy I was waiting in line with at Sonora Quest talk about MOD pizza.  He raved so much, had to give it a try.  I was impressed.  It was very good with lots of toppings at a good price.  When the \"pizza maker\" first put the red sauce on, it was less than I like.  I asked if I could have any more sauce?  He said I sure could.  He said if you want more of anything as we go, just ask.  Wife wants to make it a regular place.  Much much better than Fired Pie.  Follow up note 9/4/2016 - been here 5 times, always great!  Just ask for what you want!"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous! I have been a few times and the staff is always friendly.  You can pick any sauce and any topping to go on your pizza.  It is the same price no matter how many toppings. Gluten free crust is also available."}
{"text":"Seriously best gluten free pizza ever and amazingly friendly, courteous, and patient waitstaff. Cant say enough about this place. In fact my husband is pretty picky about gluten free crust because he usually gets regular but this gf one was so big we had to share, even though it's only the MOD (med) size, and he enjoyed it too! I can't believe how little they can charge for such an amazing pizza. Any & all the toppings you want for one super low price and the choices are plentiful, unique, and really good quality. You can even do half one thing & half another so i did that since there were so many options. Lots of sauce and finishing sauces to choose from too. Also surprised at how fast they cook in that amazing brick fire oven. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Co workers and I come here for lunch. Thin crust any toppings you want. About $10 lunch but plenty of food and quick service."}
{"text":"Delicious, only wish they made them bigger. The true test of good pizza is the leftovers the next day. These get even better hot or cold after a night in the fridge."}
{"text":"Friday night service was awesome!  Even being busy we were still greeted right away and got our 3 pizzas quick.  Beer was good too"}
{"text":"Meh it was ok. The place is dirty and under staffed. We came on a Friday night at 9 pm. The staff doesn't talk or smile while making your food, which is awkward. The tables needed to be wiped, lemonade was out, limited toppings, and the floor in the kitchen was dirty. Honestly I think fire pie is the best. I wouldn't recommend this place, just not worth $30 for 2 pizzas and a small salad."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time here, just go down the street to fired pie. I'm glad they charge the same no matter what you want on your pizza, but there is no need to be cheap on the sauce and cheese. I had half a Dominic and half red sauce with cheese and pepperoni. Both sides were awful, barely any sauce, only the slightest layer of cheese, and they made it so crispy the entire bottom was black. Had I not been watching my 2yr old and assuming they would make a good pizza I would have told them to add more sauce and cheese, unfortunately I didn't know any of this until I already got home. While the employees were extremely friendly(only reason I'm giving 2 stars) I will not be going back purely because the food was not up to par."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Tried 3 different build your own pizzas and all of them were great. Really liked the one we made with white sauce, pesto, mushrooms and gorgonzola. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"I'm not sure who is going to win in the Civil War of the amazing flavor that just came from that pizza I loved it every minute of it"}
{"text":"It's not often that I walk out of a restaurant saying \"WOW\", but that's exactly what happened today when my wife and I tried MOD Pizza for the first time.  It took some convincing to get me to go since the concept of as-many-toppings-as-you-want seemed impossible and how good a pizza be that cooks in about five minutes?   I can now unequivocally say it's EXCELLENT!      Honestly, I liked everything about MOD Pizza--you can design your own pizza or salad at a very reasonable price, the people were friendly, they had some unusually good drink choices, the music was very enjoyable, and your meal is ready by the time you can collect your Parmesan cheese shaker and silverware!       We will return soon--and frequently."}
{"text":"Good pizza with good flavor and a great idea.   The time it took was excessive but it's a new location and new staff, I will wait to go back until they have a more seasoned staff.   The issue I had:   I went back up to the register to order an additional soda and noticed that one of the staff making pizzas was just dripping in sweat...not a pleasant sight to see when someone is making food.   I understand they have the oven in the work area and I'm sure it's a warm environment. Please get the employees some fans or better ways to cool themselves.      When I do go back, I hope this issue is resolved or I will walk out and take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Staff is fun and friendly.  Pizzas are just the bomb!  The one with buffalo sauce is delish, but have gotten very good at creating my own.  I haven't found a person that doesn't love this place"}
{"text":"We love this place, they have endless options and a delicious gluten free crust for my son and I. It is a special place for us, we go any chance we get."}
{"text":"Awesome place, we ordered a couple of the 11\" inch pizzas, I must say this will be my new pizza spot.....so damn good!"}
{"text":"I can't even take my wife here, as she suffers from Celiac disease. They offer \"gluten-free\" pizza but then say \"due to the risk of cross-contamination with wheat-based products, we do NOT recommend this crust for those with celiac disease or other gluten allergies.\" In my opinion there isn't a gluten-free option if you can't even recommend the gluten free item on YOUR menu! Though, I appreciate telling me not to try it, but why have it on there if you can't recommend it?"}
{"text":"We love this place!  When it's pizza night in our house, Mod Pizza is our go to spot.  Great pizza, personalized, affordable, and delicious.  Huge fans!"}
{"text":"Stop by for a pizza and salad to take home, pizza maker was very nice, She only got one thing wrong and that was the Pesto topping I had requested at the end. Instead I got FIG. whatever that was which was ok, just a disappointment. The noise level was unacceptable.The MUSIC was very loud. Classic Rock and a little rap. It was to loud and not considered background music. I couldn't wait to get out of the place, but it was also blasting on the patio. I hope you fix this or I will go elsewhere.   I did notice they are dog friend on the patio. But no misting system and no waterbowls were provided."}
{"text":"We went to Mod Pizza for the first time this week. They have a \"Top 10\" menu of pre-selected combinations or a Create Your Own option as well! On thin crust, the 11-inch size is perfect if you're hungry ... Or if you want to get two meals out of it.  We also ordered a side of Garlic Strips. Nothing too exciting there, but they weren't bad. I will probably skip them on our next visit.  The fact that you can select as many toppings as you want, at no additional cost, really makes the possibilities endless. Plus, you can add a \"finishing sauce\" to step it up a notch!  I would recommend Mod Pizza to anyone who wants a unique, fast, & fun dining experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting health practices... everyone I know has gotten horribly ill from eating here never coming back.... I tried it after hearing it was reasonably priced... what price do you put on throwing up the next morning? Horrendous I wouldn't feed my dog that garbage...."}
{"text":"Mod pizza is a build your own pizza place. Upon arrival he whole staff says hello loudly which is cool. Then you go through the line to like subway. To make your pizza choices. They also have salad. So it doesn't matter how many toppings you choose the pizza is the same price. The ingredients Taste fresh. The restaurant is fun there are pictures everywhere an music playing. There is also outside seating which is nice for warm days like today. The only reason I gave them a four star instead of five is the pricing. So for my pizza (pictured) it was $8.00 if you come with a family you can easily spend $50 on pizza which is is way to much in my opinion when you can go to an Italian place and get a whole big pie, drinks, and a salad at that price."}
{"text":"Super Friendly Staff, fastest fresh pizza in the East Valley. But fast isn't all, it's also the best pricing for a custom 11\" pie I've ever seen.  Probably should mention that it is also wildly delicious. There are several \"kit\" pizza's but all are customizable with a huge selection of delicious toppings.  Our son had a ball ordering his very own custom pizza made just for him, and since Mods are single sized, Mom & Dad didn't have to compromise. Definitely going to be our new pizza spot."}
{"text":"Looking for a place for a quick bite to eat while driving through Phoenix. We were not overly hungry so this looked like a perfect place. A couple of small pizzas would hit the spot.  The good: attractive, modern decor; restaurant was well-laid out and had plenty of room for large or small parties. Staff was very friendly and answered questions (even when it was the same question) fully and completely. Nice layout of ingredients, lots of variety for just about anything you would want on your pizza. Wife ordered a salad which she said was good. The bad: sorry to say this, but the pizza. Even with a nice mix of toppings, it was bland and lacked flavor. Even though I picked up the pizzas as soon as they came out of the oven, by the time I got to the table they looked like they had been sitting out under a heat lamp for several hours. Maybe they did 't cook it enough, maybe the oven was off....I don't know.  Given the reviews on here, I would be willing to give it another shot if I am in the area. I would hope for better food."}
{"text":"Bomb pizza. Unlimited toppings, great drinks, friendly staff and a cool restaurant design. All around 5 star experience. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite create your own pizza place. Their toppings are vast, food is delicious, and atmosphere is energetic. Only bummer is that they're not on Uber Eats and have no delivery services."}
{"text":"BEST MOD pizza I've been too! They are friendly, quick, and very observant to their customers. I would drive out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"The pizzas in this place have no flavor, and the place is dirty and a zoo. It's like a bad pizza salad bar."}
{"text":"First time here and I was very impressed!  The workers are great and friendly and the pizza is awesome.  Love that you can just pick what you want.  Great price!!"}
{"text":"So me being the dummy I am I accidentally ordered for a to go in Portland Or. I came and they said for me to not even worry about it, made me a salad and a pizza and no additional charge and said they would call the Portland store for me, these guys are too awesome! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Mod Pizza, and I have to say, it was fantastic! I have heard nothing but good things about Mod, so I had very high expectations when coming in. I expected to be a little disappointed because my expectations were so high, but I wasn't disappointed in the slightest! First, the employees were very friendly and informative. They helped me through the entire process and didn't rush me at all. All of the toppings I chose were very fresh and delicious. The pizzas didn't take long to cook at all and I really liked the crunchiness of the crust. I really liked their fresh blackberry lemonade and their sodas tasted very freshly carbonated and clean; they didn't taste watered down or like they had dirty spouts. I really like how they don't have a giant list of menu prices; they only have a few sizes of pizzas and only one size of drink, with other extras you can get as well. The decor is also very modern and the place was virtually spotless. I can 100% see why MOD is so successful! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I first have to day that I love Mod Pizza. I love the flexibility of pizza modification, love the toppings and the price.   But I don't think you can call it fast food anymore unless you get there at the right time.    We tried to get a pizza a few weeks ago on our way to a concert and had to leave when we only allowed 45 minutes.  The line to order was going to take 30 minutes.    Last night we tried using their online ordering -  we went into an infinite loop and finally gave up after wasting 20 minutes registering, ordering, and providing credit card information.    I called the shop to see if our order had been received - it hadn't - so they took my order over the phone and said it would be ready in 30 minutes. Thirty minutes later, my order was not yet started.    I'll have to be content with Mod Pizza for lunch.  It just doesn't work for pizza night."}
{"text":"I work close to this place and am never disappointed. Paul, Rudy, and Nick are friendly, polite and efficient. The food is always consistently delicious!"}
{"text":"Good food, great prices, BUT their garlic bread strips totally suck. It's basically a pizza with butter, garlic, and way too much rosemary. Don't order them. Everything else was great!"}
{"text":"Best gluten free pizza I've ever had! So good that I've been here two days in a row. I just wish they would make the mini gf. I highly recommend MOD - yum!"}
{"text":"What more can you ask then a personalized pizza for lunch.  Lots of toppings ranging from the dough to the sauces.  The staff is friendly, the food is good and the place is clean. What more can you ask for?  Before you ask they even have beer.   The pizza doesn't take that look to cook but if you are in a pinch for time you can order ahead and schedule a take out order. I've been to MOD pizza a few times now and I have not been disappointed.  If you don't like it then you probably made a mistake in your ingredients."}
{"text":"Today I took 25 of my students to MOD pizza in Chandler for a celebratory lunch. The staff was unbelievable. They took all of our orders and we got our pizzas within 20 minutes. The staff was friendly and very helpful with any of our questions. I ordered the Dominic pizza with white sauce and it was unbelievable. They added mushrooms and it complemented the white sauce very well. I highly recommend this place for anyone that wants a quick lunch, or just a great place to hang out with family and friends. Tony took care of our group and even gave us a hand written receipt for our records. Great atmosphere and amazing food!"}
{"text":"Walked in, and they greeted us at the door. The person at the counter was trying to explain how it worked, not very well but we can read, so it wasn't hard to figure out. Putting the pizza together was slow and disorganized. We got there right before the lunch crowd and I'm glad because I wouldn't want to wait in that line as they fumbled around trying to put the pizzas together. That being said, the food was great and priced well. I put the slow line/assembly as they have only been open a week and it should be better. You can tell they were all new people. It would have been 5 stars if that was fixed. Seating was also not that great, but ohh well.   Had a chicken, ham, mushroom, olive, tomato pizza and my lady had mushroom and ham. Crust was thin and crispy. Cheese was good, toppings were good. Next time I will do something a bit weird like a siracha chicken or something like that."}
{"text":"First time to Mod in Chandler and it did not disappoint one bit.  Some of us had pizza and some had salad it was all terrific.  Most definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"The food is great but that's not at all why I'm leaving this review. I've been to this location 3 times now so I've seen a wide range of different employees working. They are AWESOME. Seriously wanted to just give a huge props to the management here behind it all as well as the amazing team. I am a manager in the food business & this place actually inspires me to seek out & train employees as good as the ones here. Keep it up guys."}
{"text":"I didn't know why it took so long for me to come it..   Concept: 5/5 to be able to pick all your toppings with no extra charge. Whether you want a mini (6in) personal pizza or the MOD (11in) or the Mega (double crusted 11inches) pizza. And bake in brick oven.. very awesome.. and yes that include built your own salad too.   Pizza: 4/5 I order the MOD., with grilled chicken, their signature sauce, roasted corn, pineapples, grilled broccoli and typical mozzarella cheese! My only complaint is, their crust in the middle can be on the thin side. Making it all fall apart.. it's hard to pick up. I ended up using fork and knife to eat!   Customer service: 5/5 they are more than willing to explain the concept if it's your first time there. With patience and consistency, I don't feel so overwhelmed! So I would defiantly come back, next time I'll try the salad!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent fir a pizza joint. The kids live it because they get to pick out exactly what the want on their pizzas."}
{"text":"Went today as they were having a grand opening special. The pizza was delicious and fresh, and I liked that you can really customize it and it comes out fast. The garlic bread was just a thin pizza crust with seasoning so I wouldn't get that again. The shakes were okay but nothing special. The staff was really nice and efficient. I really appreciate that they are making donations to charity this week. The pizza is a little expensive for the size, but I'll certainly go back. Coupons wouldn't hurt"}
{"text":"Since I saw MOD Pizza I planned to visit one day and finally I was there a couple of times a couple of weks ago.  Actually their pizzas can have lots of toppings and very generous size.  Although the taste is not the best but still a way over average, also  regarding the price, their pizzas are well worth to try.  I also had the draft beer there.  No varieties but still good.  I will definitely go back there many times."}
{"text":"While I am not typically a fan of chain eateries, I was curious and had to check this one out. I'm really glad I did. I think I may have just found my new favorite pizza place! There is a huge variety of standard and non-standard toppings, including but not limited to asiago cheese, roasted red peppers, artichokes and fresh garlic. You can select from a dozen or so pre-selected topping combo pizzas, then add or delete toppings as desired. The best part, NO EXTRA CHARGE for add'l toppings! They're not stingy about it either. The crust is thin, and comes in 3 sizes:  6\" lunch portion for less than $5, 11\" standard for $7.49 and MEGA sized for families $11.79. Bottom line, I think this place has found the perfect balance between quality and value. Glad they opened one up in our town. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"I think MOD pizza might be one of the best things that's happened to Ahwatukee in a long time... (well, right next to the remodeled AMC with the bar and $5 dollar Tuesday movies with reclining leather seats... amazing!) Seriously, it's delicious, fast, has a friendly staff, cool atmosphere, super reasonable for a good size pizza with unlimited toppings. And at happy hour I definitely recommend getting a $5 dollar pitcher!   This will be a regular stop for us!"}
{"text":"Definitely a good place to go if you don't mind spending an extra Buck or two. I personally love flatbread pizza and I got to pick my ingredients and have a beer to go with it. They have a good thing going. ( they could lower the price by $1.00 or more to make it a 5)"}
{"text":"We see this everywhere.  It's really sad when a great place gets popular and employees think ok to slack on quality and service when someone puts heart and soul into opening a business.  I let it slide last time when the gal just threw my toppings in the center and didn't even spread them out. This is a fav pizza spot of mine being a regular cust on average once a week with an online account for lunch pick ups.  Then dissapointed to see the dilapidated crust which are pre-cut/sized for the pizza box that didn't even fill the box. Quarter of the pizza was missing.   Product outcomes speaks volumes of the employees... Just dissapointed"}
{"text":"Good price for what you're getting if you like a lot of toppings. The pizza is awesome but there is almost always a wait and it's hard to find seating for a group larger than four people. I'm also really disappointed that they have unfinished wood paneling on the walls! I understand it's for decoration but if you sit near it like I did, be prepared to get multiple splinters. Not a great idea in a place like Gilbert with so many kids running around..."}
{"text":"Love it, one of my favorite pizza in my area, especially their gluten free, I wish they can add more flavors some of NY or Chicago flavors"}
{"text":"I would love to give this a 5 because when it is good, it is awesome. Unfortunately, it has been a hit and miss experience for us.  One time it is close to perfect (been there about 9 times). The next time it is not. The cooking seems to be inconsistent. The crust has been all over the place. One time it will be under cooked, another time it will be almost burnt.  When it is right, it is amazing! Just wish it was not a roll of the dice."}
{"text":"This place is excellent ! More personal sized pizza which is really good for me and my husband. The toppings are included and  service is super friendlya"}
{"text":"Want to hear a joke about pizza?  Never mind....it's too cheesy!  But seriously, MOD Pizza is fast, fresh and oh so yummy.  I mean, whats better than a pizza you can completely customize from top to bottom for one price.  Nothing.    BONUS for the super friendly staff working there and the Papago Orange Blossom on tap.  Mmmmmm.   Overall, it's absolute pizza nirvana.    NOM NOM NOM"}
{"text":"I did carry out here, pre-paid online, the website was simple and worked well without error. We was very pleased with our two pizzas, and the salad was great, the grilled chicken was very good, and the spicy Italian sausage was great. I got the gluten free crust it was one of the best I've had out and wasn't sweet like other gluten free crust. I will be back here!"}
{"text":"The pizza was a fail for me. They over-cooked it from what my friends said. Had a slice of his and I agree. But since, I  opted for the salad. The salad is fantastic. Great price for the large and enough to share.. actually kind have to share. Second day salads are No Bueno.   Cool atmosphere. Like the fresh food. But still, not a fan of their pizzas. And since its kinda in their name and should be their staple I got to take them down a notch. Order the salad if you do try them out."}
{"text":"I went here today for the first time and your pizza is very good! I love the build your one pizza aspect, and the prices are decent priced as well. My husband and I will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"The biggest problem here is the staff.  If I owned this place i would clean house! They make the customer feel like an annoyance...They have a bad culture going on in this place.  We've all seen it before.  Unhappy employees or they don't like there job.. whatever it is.  Need supervision...  Mainly the tall female worker there. She is rude and never smiles.  Bad attitudes and they dont have a clue what good customer service is.. Not a welcoming place at all.  A restaurant won't last with this going on.  The low sales numbers will show for this poor service I'm sure.. So I certainly hope the owner reads this.    So now on to the food.  The pizza is decent.  Price is good at $7.47 for an 11 inch Cracker crust pizza which is good.  Although they are skimpy on the toppings even though I asked for extra cheese, they barely put any on to cover the sauce then said we will add extra at the end of the line on top.  So if you like a lot of toppings this isn't your place.  We wanted to try this place being a similar concept to Fired Pie and Pizza Studio.    Bottomline... Fired Pie is levels above this place.  Customer service and the quality of pizza."}
{"text":"This is a good spot for lunch as it is very quick and cost effective. Building your own 11\" pizza cost around $8 for unlimited toppings. There is also a smaller cheaper size if you aren't very hungry. The build your own option makes this a good spot for vegetarians and picky eaters. The restaurant is clean and the staff is interactive and friendly. I ended up only eating half my 11\" pizza because I got full but they supply to-go boxes that even come with with reheating instructions."}
{"text":"Best service! Best pizza! Del is always awesome with exceptional customer service. The food is so good I eat here 4 times a week"}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place. The pizza is flavorless, with seemingly cheap ingredients and very little sauce. The concept is not unique, either. Try Fired Pie for the same idea with better food."}
{"text":"What a great experience MOD was. I had never been to one and from the moment we walked in I knew I would like it. We were greeted by the staff and walked through what we were supposed to do. My son created his pizza with all meats except 2, which he LOVED. I was able to add \"grown up\" things like olives and green peppers to mine, without him complaining about it...LOL. And I LOVED that I could mix my black tea with lemonade for a delicious drink. We will definitely go back...for sure!!"}
{"text":"Great personal pizza place!!! Staff was happy and cheerful. The guy who helped me said \"have a beautiful day\"...um (!!!!!!) so happy and cute! Love it."}
{"text":"The pizza and milkshakes here are amazing and the staff is the best! They are so fun, friendly and personable. Prices are great too. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Shout out to the Saturday night crew! Life got busy and before we knew it, it was 10:40 (they close at 11) and we had nothing prepared to eat and didn't want any greasy fast food.   I called in my order and the pizzas were just being pulled out of the oven.  It was also a pleasant surprise to walk in that close to closing time and find a group off happy employees.  We have been here on multiple visits and they always get my order right and make sure the pizza is cooked crispy (make sure you ask for crispy FYI!!)"}
{"text":"Fantastic choices for a delicious thin crust pizza and or a delicious pizza.  Customer service is awesome too"}
{"text":"Now offering PBR in BOTTLES!! oh, yeah, and the best pizza around! Love this place...highlight of our work week...EVERY FRIDAY!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.   Felipe and his team are the BEST!   Looking forward to my next trip."}
{"text":"Ty, scoobie, and kofer were all super amazing with customer service and handled my order amazingly! I'm vegan and didn't even think of changing the pizza cutter (rookie mistake) but Ty thankfully told me he was going to do that for me because of my restrictions. Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"Ate many times at the #NewburyPark & #ThousandOaks #California #SoCal #LosAngeles area MOD Pizza. Scottsdale MOD is a great location. Easy-to-Order pizza is ready in a snap, great toppings to choose, friendly , clean, they are keen  On school fundraisers which is nice, and the pizza is filling, cooked perfectly, tasty crust, and many choices for prime seating. Had the Greek olive & mushroom."}
{"text":"This place is the best. You walk in, tell them what you want, the ingredients are all fresh and delicious, and the pie is very reasonably priced. The \"MOD\" size is just right for a hungry one person, or as a snack for two people. The beers on tap are very good and local, and the fresh ice teas are delicious. I can't imagine not having MOD around our neighborhood -- we're regulars and I hope you'll support this business. There are few places that can make a fast meal that tastes as fresh and delicious as one of these wood fired pizzas."}
{"text":"We stopped by one evening for dinner and I enjoyed the Jasper pizza with mozzarella, meatballs, and mushroom - so tasty!  The food comes out quickly, the staff is really friendly and the atmosphere is nice too."}
{"text":"Online ordered from this place and it was pretty good.  I dont expect much from pizza places here in town as I was spoiled as a kid eating Brooklyn and NYC pizza growing up.  This place was close and was almost as good as Grimaldi's.  We ordered three pies and a small salad.  I liked the crust and they were big slices so can you fold them easily.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Pizza meets subway! A great quick lunch meeting place with a cool vibe. I love the ability to build my own pizza. Another cool factor is the fact they have a gluten free option."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have vegan cheese so it's easy to eat a vegan pizza which is why I like eating here. The staff is always kind and caring as well!"}
{"text":"Close to home and a quick place to grab lots of veggies! Woo hoo!   This is. Great spot if you're picky. The service was fast, the place was clean and the veggies we're fresh. I love that you can customize your pizza or salad at a decent price. Makes me so happy to have all the veggies I want.   Good thing is that you can go shopping afterwards. I tend to drink water with meals but really like the teas and lemonade here."}
{"text":"June 18 2018 6 pm today's crew was amazing The food was also amazing  this is not the same crew that I have seen in the past they all must be new"}
{"text":"Love the variety of toppings and sauces! We never get tired of MOD pizza! The lemonades are also SO Good!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is amazing, the price, the staff, the decoration and quality of food. They have the best crust that I've ever eaten and the fact that doesn't matter how many toppings I choose the price will remains the same is awesome! The place is always clean and the stuff is always polite and happy. They are also pretty fast on get your food done. I highly recommend this place if you are a pizza lover!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times before with groups and stopped in today for a BBQ chicken pizza fix.  I love the thin, crispy, but still chewy crust.   Employees were friendly and helpful, but the dining area was a little grungier than one would expect.  I was told the place had just been slammed.  It was hard to find a clean table despite the fact that the place was now pretty empty.  The motion light in the bathroom went off for me mid-pee, which scared the crud out of me and left me waving my arms like a choir director."}
{"text":"We went to MOD Pizza to take advantage of the Teacher Appreciation event this evening.  We arrived around 7:00 and the place was packed. The line was out the door and we thought our order would take forever.  We were pleasantly surprised at the efficiency and speed in which our order was placed and finished. No one seemed to be bothered by the long lines, the staff was friendly, calm, and patient with all the customers and orders being taken.  My first time to MOD and we were impressed."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious! Employees are very friendly and it's not expensive.  I got the Dillon James. I thought the white (Alfredo) sauce looked disappointing. I substituted the white sauce for garlic and olive oil..... Mmmmm yum!"}
{"text":"Everything about my most recent trip to Mod exceeded or met my expectations. I'm not rating it 5 stars because it was the most exceptional pizza I've ever tasted, but rather, I'm giving it 5 stars because everything about the experience was great. We were served quickly and politely. The lady helping us out answered our questions and had plenty of patience while my wife and I took forever to make up our minds. The selection of toppings were good and the price was actually a little lower than we expected. The pizzas came out tasting great and were paired with a great selection of drinks. Overall, my wife and I had no complaints."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time this weekend. Pizza was good but amazing like other reviews. I will try it again but with more toppings next time. Pep and cheese was ok. The girl taking our order was speaking to low and me and my wife couldn't understand her which was a little frustrating. There were also a few flys bothering us at our table. Then they messed up one of our pizzas but had it out fairly quick."}
{"text":"I did the red and vodka white sauce, and it was delicious, put minced garlic on it,mozz , pepperoni, mild sausage , salami, and asiago cheese on top and when it came out I got Buffalo sauce on the side, folded it every dip and it was like eating a calzone , so delicious, the next time I added red peppers and garlic cloves, and it was even better, the staff is super friendly and just overall had a great experience!!!"}
{"text":"I always have a great dining experience here. The service of the staff is great, expected as they cater to the stuck up and difficult Arcadia crowd. The speed is spectacular, I would say from the time you're ordering to sitting down and eating is 10-12 minutes. The selection of crusts, toppings, sauces, and finishing drizzles is amazing. FRESH. The indoor layout is cool, outdoor patio is abundant and shady. Music can be a lil loud sometimes especially during their live music nights. Overall, I love it, and the location is prime."}
{"text":"Okay so the only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars was because it took forever for us to get our pizzas!  Really that's the only complaint and it probably should have been expected because everyone knows pizza isn't quick to cook. The crust was somehow crunchy and chewy at the same time. And I had a blackberry lemonade that was incredible!"}
{"text":"High quality topping for the price.  Unique drinks available like pear iced tea. My favorite place for pizza these days."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great price for an 11 inch personal pizza. I had the Caspian and it was really good!  This is our new favorite pizza place.   Great vibe here too. Kind of industrial. Love the music here. It's like the old ska/punk I used to listen to back in the 90's.   Management is awesome. Good job Brian!"}
{"text":"Service was prompt and friendly. Pizza was good but not amazing. I think we would need to try various combinations of toppings to come up with a pizza/salad we really like. I liked the options for lemonades and tea."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh!!!!  My husband and I split the salad and a pizza.  I love that you can create your own pizza AND salad. Lots to choose from!!!  Delicious and fresh ingredients and a fantastic crust...I should know-I\"m from New York!!!!!"}
{"text":"When I want my mod pizza this is one of my favorite locations because of Becky! And April! They even remember that I wanted to have real vanilla syrup in my orange blossom craft beer you guys rock!"}
{"text":"I don't believe in love at first sight but I do believe in love at first bite  MOD continues to be one of my go to spots for lunch with my co workers. The staff is always friendly, the price is reasonable and the pizza is absolutely amazing!! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best pizzas I've eaten since 1992 when I ate the best pizza ever in South France!!  Wow! This place is awesome! They have toppings I've always wanted to try and I felt guilty asking them to put so much on my pizza!  I will definitely be bringing dates here!!!  NOTE: they offer a veteran discount! Salute!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying MOD pizza, and it was such a cool experience! It's basically like a design-your-own pizza line. What made me really happy was that they had gluten free options too! However, it's not a 100% gluten free kitchen so if you're severely gluten intolerant than this might not be the place for you. It was super fast and pretty good service. They had a bunch of options to choose from too! One MOD sized pizza (personal sized) is about 6 slices but on super thin crust, so it fills you up perfectly!"}
{"text":"This is an update for my previous review about MOD asking us to pay for a cup with a lid to be able to give water to our 3 year old without worrying about him spilling. Well Mike, the district manager for MOD, reached out to me the very next day after my review posted and genuinely apologized for the incident. He ensured me that all cashiers would be properly trained and that this wouldn't happen again and even sent me a gift card so that I would give MOD another chance. My mom and I took my two boys last week and when we asked for a cup with lid for my son the cashier handed it right over. I could tell that Mike followed through and made sure that everyone was properly trained. We had a great and stress-free dining experience and the food was great as always! I love companies that use Yelp feedback to improve guest experiences and will definitely continue to eat at MOD!"}
{"text":"It looked a little trendy, so I thought it was going to be expensive, to my surprise it was actually a great value. Me and my wife were able to share an $8 pizza!  The crust could have a little more sustanance, the employees a little more enthusiastic but in the end we had a pretty good pizza.  A star was lost because the outdoor seating area was crawling with spiders! Please spray the area. Parking also is a premium here, park  behind the building next to the side of Costco, always plenty of spots and you won't have to walk."}
{"text":"Great salads and pizza. Nice selection of pizza toppings. Fairly prompt service. Just a bit complicated, a little pricey and they could use more family friendly tables. Worth trying and I suspect we'll be back."}
{"text":"I like the fact that it's add whatever toppings you want and pay the same price. I think it's great spot for a family pizza night. Everyone get the personal pizzas and enjoy. The crust is pre made, thin crust. I prefer a thicker crust, but that didn't stop me from eating it. It's about a 15 minute drive from me. Realistically I probably wouldn't return, I'm more of a NY style pizza girl. A lot of my neighbors have given this place great reviews. If my son ever request pizza I'd take him here and let him enjoy \"making\" his own pizza."}
{"text":"This is becoming a regular stop for our family on the way to Chandler BMX. If you've not been here, stop denying yourself! The pizza is really good, not the best pizza in town, but really good! What you get here is the ability to bury a pizza crust with whatever your heart desires and you don't even have to pay extra for mounds of your favorite topping!! Pick the size, pile on the goods, pay a fixed price! It's brilliant!"}
{"text":"Fun place. We each created our own pizza. I love kalamata olives and anchovies on pizza and they had them both!!  Really liked the thin crust. Place wasn't too busy - got our pizzas very quickly. Great price too!  Told our new Phoenix area college student that this would be a great place to come with roommate - great deal to split a pizza (completely loaded of course) at a great price."}
{"text":"My first review of this place was super short - Why? Because I was writing it while waiting for my pizza and it's done so quick that I had to stop! I love this place! \"Made On Demand\" (MOD) pizza - why haven't I encountered this before? First off the staff here is great! Always very nice. They show pride in their product an are ready to explain, sample, etc to show you how good things are. And it is good. Yummy thin crispy pizza with a fantastic fire oven taste. Pizzas are all one price and you can build your own with one topping or many - same price. A TON of options- different sauces, cheeses, toppings, gluten free - plus everything is peanut/treenut free which is important in our house! Other food options too - garlic strips, salads, even some dessert options. All have been amazing. If you live in the area and you haven't tried - you are missing out."}
{"text":"Wow... it's like subway for pizza but even better! Choose your toppings at the counter... slide on thru...get your kingdong  style dessert or garlic slices or both and the lemonade is awesome.. quick hot and fast... if you use to many ingredients it may be hard to get everything cooked up without burning the crust... but hey pile it on!!!  I like the thicker double crust 11\". Salads are great too..  And pull the paper out from underneath it ASAP.. or it'll get soggy and a papery mess."}
{"text":"Yes this is one of my favorite pizza joints here in the valley customer service is always on point! My boy Ty and his crew always comes through for me especially with my orange blossom brew with a little twist of the Nella added in it."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great value. Very nice staff who remembers our family each time. The patio could use misters but the inside has ample seating."}
{"text":"This is another solid \"build your own\" pizza joint, so many seem to be popping up lately. Today was the second time Scott picked up a pie, which we shared for lunch. There's three sizes/choices in crust: mini, regular, and double crust - four if you add the gluten free option - we get the regular thin crust. You can create your own pie with their plethora of ingredients, or go with their menu suggestions.   Both times we have thoroughly enjoyed the Za, the first was a Margerita, the second was white with garlic drizzle, asiago, mozzarella, ricotta, and Parmesan; it was delicious and the perfect size for us to share for lunch. The crust was thin, crispy, and well done as ordered.   We are fans, and will be back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love MOD pizza. We discovered it when we lived in Southern California and it's one of the places we missed about living there. When they opened one here in Mesa we were so excited. It's still delicious- just the wait is insane. Not really their fault, but it seemed much faster back in SoCal. Still worth it."}
{"text":"I can't think of anything I don't like. So good, I actually had lunch here two days in a row! Great tasting and fresh ingredients. Excellent service. Clean and modern decor. Fantastic price for what you get. I'll certainly be a regular."}
{"text":"Great customer service and there pizza is delicious. Both me and my fiancé loved this place and will be coming back. Also there lemonade is so good! And the timing was good as well."}
{"text":"I haven't gotten my food yet but I will never come back. The staff is so rude because they want to close. I get that it's the end of the day if you don't want to be open at 8:45 then close at 8."}
{"text":"From the moment I walked in, their set-up looked a lot like Subway subs (adding toppings down the line as you please). So for that reason, I wasn't expecting high hopes on quality, taste, or both.   After my first order today, pizza is really delicious. You can either order custom pizzas that are already pre-made with Mod suggestions listed on the side wall with ingredients, or you can make yours custom right there on the spot. All the decisions and the wait time for the pizza to cook, took about 10min. They also have glass bottles of Fanta & Coca-Cola (real Mexican style) which I loved! All pizzas are thin crust, and I really wish I would have ordered a mini size. The next level up is the Mod size, and I could barely eat 3 out of the 4 slices. Keep in mind I'm a 30yr old 200 lbs 6 foot tall guy. I had my pizza with extra red sauce, mozzarella cheese, gorgonzola cheese, chicken, pepperoni, and salami. The price including the glass coca-cola bottle was $10.89. I know with fluctuations, prices are increasing, although I still feel it's a bit much, but again perhaps the Mod size was too big. I almost want to give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"This location was different from others that we visited. They were very stingy on toppings, and definitely not as friendly as the other restaurants. We visited twice, and had a similar experience each time. The customer service is not as strong as the other locations. Of course, The pizza is always good."}
{"text":"So here is my issue with MOD pizza:  Apparently I eat too much in one sitting. The way this was determined - I could easily eat two \"Mod\" size pizzas.   So how can I correct this? I can't.   The next size option is just making the crust twice as thick, not my idea of a good thin crust pizza. So either I leave hungry from eating one pizza, or pay a crazy amount for two (at least for a lunch that would be a bit crazy).  The pizza was great, the staff was very nice, I just wish they had an additional size pizza for people who are actually hungry...   This is America... SUPER SIZE ME!"}
{"text":"I first tried a MOD Pizza in Jacksonville FL a few weeks ago and loved it. I tried this MOD Pizza and love it too!  It's every bit as welcoming and upbeat, the service is excellent and the food arrives quickly. My daughter and I had MOD pizzas and were very pleased with both. The pizza is put together right in front of you and then cooked. The crust is thin. Very thin. It's very good too!  They also have a gluten free crust, but as always cross contamination is a possibility, so keep that in mind if you need to be absolutely gluten free.  Since the crust is so thin, it only took about 8 min for two pizzas to cook. Mine had sauce and cheese plus 3 other things on it. Not a bad oven to table time at all.  Beverages are self serve and there is the usual assorted soft drinks offered as well as sweet and unsweetened tea and two kinds of lemonade. AND THE HAVE CRUNCHY ICE!!!!!  Try this place! Experiment with toppings! Above all you will enjoy the high level of customer service, eating quickly and tasty food."}
{"text":"I came to MOD with an appetite and an expectation. The marquee reads \"FAST\", unfortunately, the service was anything but. There were six customers in the restaurant and it took MOD employees (at least 5 of them that I could see / could see me)  12 minutes to tell me that someone would be with me soon. As the only person in the queue, this is unacceptable."}
{"text":"I was in last Friday (12/2/16) for my first time.  The pizza was great BUT I had an awful experience that is still upsetting me.  So I went through the line and a guy named (Ricky) was running around and snaps at another male employee (not positive of his name he was at the ovens...he is bald with a beard and earrings) this Ricky person was calling him names and referring to him by \"sugarplum and sweetie\" you could see the oven guy was uncomfortable but he took it anyway. I was horrified that the man was put into a position like that. I would hate to work with someone like Ricky who's so disrespectful. I hope someone will look into it. My pie was great the experience not so much."}
{"text":"Keto friendly! Choose a salad and put as many low carb, high fat toppings on it for one price."}
{"text":"I've been in here a few times on my lunch break. It's a nice change from the normal every day think I usually have time to get on my breaks. It was yummy, quick and the staff was super friendly and fun. I've even taken my husband back one weekend because I like it so much."}
{"text":"I love the pizza and the staff is friendly.  Prices are reasonable.  You don't have to wait long for the pizza."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place!!  Its great for a family with kids.  Theres enough back ground noise so you don't have to worry about disturbing people with you loud kids.  They have GF pizza and dairy free cheese! The prices are super cheap for the quality.  We felt satisfied and nourished after we ate.  I like that everyone gets their own personal pizza..so, you can junk it up or be as boring as you want.  They also serve beer and wine on tap.........after we ate our last meal there, my whole family got the stomach flu.."}
{"text":"Always good, always fresh, and always amazing service! Tyler gave us exceptional service recently. We absolutely love the staff. The food comes out quick, and there's plenty of seating! One of our favorite places!"}
{"text":"Great food unlimited toppings great if lunch for you is what your looking for.  Mike is the man."}
{"text":"2pm lunch, long wait,  rude food prep people...didn't like that i asked for dressing on my salad.  1st and last time coming here."}
{"text":"First time here. Came with two young children and atmosphere was perfect.  Pizzas were perfectly portioned and ingredients were generous. I prefer a cracker crust with tons of ingredients so it was perfect.  The mini size is good for kids and MOD size was more than enough for an adult.  Great concept!  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"My family and I love MOD!  This location does a great job just like their other locations."}
{"text":"The pizza was excellent and the prices were amazing.  We had two 6\" pizzas, made to order, and two sodas for under $14.  We will come here again, and bring friends with us."}
{"text":"You know how Subway has a big selection of things to put onto your sandwich... this place does that... with pizza toppings! Choose a size personal, \"MOD\" (medium) or large. The 6\" personal was less than $5. The medium was just under $8 and the large was just under $10. You can completely customize your pizza with as many different toppings as you choose... and the price does not change! It is quick and the crust is thin and crispy (not everyone likes thin crust... but personally it's my favorite). Good selection of fountain drinks, iced tea, lemonade (regular or blackberry) and beers. This is my new favorite pizza place... hands down!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good and you'll never beat being able to get as many toppings as you want for the same price. But what really got me was the service. The girl who helped me was attentive, courteous, polite and just plain nice.   That earns 5 stars in my book."}
{"text":"This place was so fabulous! And it is so close to my work. I got the seasonal special pizza \"kasey\" and it was amazing. The service is so friendly and the pizza took three minutes to make! I will be back.  Also....they have papago brewery on tap and caramelized pear iced tea. Whats not to like?"}
{"text":"Fresh, flavorful & fast - the trifecta of a working mom's new favorite dinner spot!  Super thin crust which means Not greasy. Nice selection of recommended pizzas OR build your own Pizza or Salad with really fresh tasting ingredients.  The entire meal is assembled in full view by friendly efficient staff.  Nice beverage selection for adults & kiddos, I appreciate them supporting local breweries (san tan devil's ale yummm)  No matter which salad you get TRY the caesar dressing it was really really good and I am really really picky!    VAMPIRES BEWARE the fresh garlic ain't no joke!  It lingered!  Glad Mod Pizza has come to Ahwatukee, look forward to sitting in the little patio area once the temps drop below Inferno."}
{"text":"This is the 4th time I've been here and every time the food, the customer service, and the vibe are superb. You make your own pizza (like the Subway of pizza) which sounds like a recipe for disaster but it has yet to disappoint. Constantly great food. The employees are all super friendly, always giving service with a smile. The blackberry lemonade is to die for and the overall vibe is fantastic. Recommended no doubt"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!!! The ability to put whatever you want on your pizza is refreshing. First time eating here....great experience!"}
{"text":"First time, ordered an 11 inch pizza. Very good, fresh ingredients and fast service. The Manager suggested a local beer that I really liked."}
{"text":"Great place to build your own personal pizza. It's quick and always tasty. They can do gluten free crusts and are good about it. If you're a lemonade fan, don't miss the marionberry lemonade!"}
{"text":"Good pizza at a fair price. I would recommend and return. Staff was nice and the place was very clean. The pizza cook very quickly. I would not order my pizza ahead of time. If I was late it would be cold."}
{"text":"I went w/ a friend to the San Tan location in SE Gilbert. We had salad and several 11-in pizzas (some went home w/ us). The Deluxe Salad was really beautiful w/ plenty of the freshest greens, i.e., mesclun, romaine, chicken, salami, bell pepper, tomato, olives, & shaved parmesan. We loved the blue cheese & balsamic dressings, but the real winner was the amazing, thick Caesar, which would even impress Chef Cardini! My first bite of pizza was a revelation, with the super crispy, thin crust! And the fresh toppings were generously applied over our choices of sauces, etc. The sausage was a standout & I included anchovies! With the \"build-your-own\" concept, the best ingredients, outstanding crust, and excellent service, you can't go wrong. Their price point ensures top value! Wine on tap is a nice option, too. My only complaint is the entirely sad selection of just two tap beers, neither of which goes w/ pizza. PLEASE, get rid of the way-too-bitter Devil's Ale & sweet-vanilla Orange Blossom soda pop! Put in a good lager & a pale ale - even PBR or Coors Light would be better pairings! Then MOD will be be the perfect model!"}
{"text":"I loved it pizzas were tasty & not greasy & you can put as many toppings as you want!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing - great prices and fabulous staff. You can build your own pizza with your fav toppings."}
{"text":"The girl at the counter was very pleasant and helpful.  That is the upside.  The pizza was tasteless. We had pepperoni and sausage.  The sausage had no flavor.  The pizza was not cut all the way through and hard to separate.  After looking at the pictures of finished pizzas, ours sure could have cooked at least another 2 minutes. Every table was filthy as well as the floor. The top of the napkin dispenser at our table was extremely dusty and had food particles on it.   My clothes kept catching on the unfinished wood around the edge of the table and the edge of the bench seating. Dishes are placed on empty tables.  That is just nasty to have dishes sitting out like that.   The price is right with endless toppings, but the flavor just isn't there."}
{"text":"I agree with the people who also gave this place 1 star. Is this what eating out is coming to. we arrived at 9pm. First mistake! Apparently this is when the employees are suppose to check their phones.(We wanted that big Hello greeting) but didn't get it. After telling employee about Gluten Allergy she was careless with handling of product. I travel for a living just a Bad vibe at these new concept Restaurants. We left never to return. Rather pay more at Fuel. P.S. I have free coupon at MOD'S all yours!"}
{"text":"Great options and price for a pizza joint. Lots of flavor. Crunchy crust. Modern take on a classic and quick too boot. First time here and looking forward to repeat visits."}
{"text":"Stopped by on the opening day and then today again.  Love this concept of the one price, unlimited toppings pizza model.  The pizza is light and delicious.  I had the Tristan pizza today and it was great with the addition of some sweet/hot peppers.  Staff are really friendly.  You can tell they take the time to focus on customer service as much as the pizza.  Great addition to the Ahwatukee community."}
{"text":"I'll be going back for my third time in 3 weeks tonight. I live close by and decided to take my 5 year old to it for a \"date\" night. The plaza, like others have said, is busy and parking can kind of be tricky. They honestly could use some more space because it has been packed every time I have been there (Friday and Saturday nights). The line moves relatively quickly, about the same as a Chipotle.  The food itself is pretty dang good. With your own choice of unlimited toppings, the type of pizza is truly up to you. The crust is thin and they don't go overboard on the sauce. I have a 2 and 5 year old who both loved it, maybe it was the promise of free milkshakes if they behaved (which yes they got thanks to \"magic\"). While I know the free milkshakes are most likely limited and just trying to promote families to come back, it worked!"}
{"text":"Friendliest staff! Very clean location, prompt service even though they were packed. The food was fresh tasting and delicious."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant after just one visit! The pizza is fast and great pizza! Unlimited toppings. Lots of flavor. The Gm (Brian) was there and really friendly. Got to talk to him for a while. Salads, cheese bread, cinni-bread! It's all good. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I really like the concept of MOD Pizza: Fresh, light pizza in a fast-casual environment.  I would give this MOD Pizza five stars if the workers were more friendly.  I've now eaten at this MOD Pizza twice since it opened. Each time, I've been really impressed with the pizza, but the people who take the order and make the pizza seem grumpy. The man who serves as the cashier and who calls out your name when your pizza is ready is friendly, though.  I really like this place and would recommend it. I'm sure I will visit again for lunch. I just wish the people who greet you and who make your pizza would attempt to smile."}
{"text":"I've only ever done pickup for this location because it's right near my job and in the 2 times I've tried it, it's been less than average. People seem to really love this place. I've only had a plain 6 inch from here which I believe is called the Maddy? In my opinion, both times the pizza was incredibly chewy and undercooked. I even asked for it to be made well done. The 2nd time I ordered it tasted spicy which was weird to me. I don't think I'll be back..Other than that..the staff was friendly and the place was really clean!"}
{"text":"Finally broke down to check out MOD pizza, I've past by it 100 times.  LEGIT!!!  This is a kick ass pizza place. Me and my 11 year old stopped in for dinner on a Thursday, staff was super friendly in helping out us first timers. My son was so overwhelmed with all the toppings he froze under pressure, I had to help him out. Actually i was too, trying to figure out what exactly would be my perfect pizza. I'm glad to say that I didn't make it my first time, so I WILL have to come back several more times to try again.  Super fun for my kid to put what ever he wanted on his pizza, I loved it too.  I wish I would of seen the gluten free option before I ordered!!! WE\"LL BE BACK!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I frequently visit this location. They make us feel like rockstars when we enter and exit - making sure to welcome everyone and wish them a great rest of their day when you leave. The food is amazing - allowing you to pick any and all the toppings you want without additional fees. Their service is super quick - and the place always looks clean. I would highly recommend this location of MOD Pizza!"}
{"text":"Oh My Lord. Please go try. Staff is the best!!! I was about to head over to Zappa's, but I'm so happy I ran into this place. Seriously, thanks MOD team for making this the best experience:)."}
{"text":"OK, OK, but just that. My husband and I stopped at MOD the other day since we were shopping in the Steele Creek area. We were excited to try MOD as it was one of the first fast pizza joints we saw pop up in the Charlotte area (since then Blaze and Zblong have joined the party).    I ordered the mini pizza (6\" $4.95) for myself as a BYO. I got the white sauce with a handful of veggies topped with pesto. My husband got a mini as well and we split the garlic strips. The minis were the perfect size and were less than $5. Great to get lunch somewhere cheap! I also liked that they had 3 different pizza sizes to pick from!   The only thing I didn't like was the crust. It tasted like Nann- not pizza dough. It was thin, but too thin for my liking. Also a little burnt on the edges.   The service was great though and the staff greeted everyone as they came in and said goodbye/thank you to everyone who walked out the door- you don't see that much!"}
{"text":"Good Pizza. Thin crust. The Calexico is nice and spicy. The Olivia is nice and pesto-y... (lol). Great and quick for a quick lunch. Was early (11am) and average priced like most single pizza places around."}
{"text":"Fast Casual. This is it. Fresh ingredients, and you customize it for one price! That's impressive. That's why this place is amazing. Deciding and comprising on toppings with your party? Forget about it!  It's all good. Get what you want. One price to rule them all! It's not New York, Chicago or Pizza Hut pizza. It's different, fresh, fast, cheap. Open your mind and accept a new concept in pizza. Drinks are NIIIIIIIICE, I finally tried a peach tea. Anyway; for all you low carb waist watching pizza fans, it's not too much bread. That's a GOOD thing. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place was wonderful. I felt and said this before I even tasted the food, all because of the wonderful service. The employees at this location were super friendly and helpful. And of course the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Nice, quick, inexpensive, non-greasy wood fired pizza. You pick all your own toppings and sauce for no additional price, and they have $2 draft beers all day on Tuesdays! The manager, Conrad West, and the entire staff were so helpful. Thank you!"}
{"text":"We ventured in hungry for some great pizza with the choices provided. Okay, so ordering for a family of six with a variety of tastes should be easier with a good selection of toppings but no! I think you have to grab a menu first decide then order otherwise you get overwhelmed. We had a variety and tried the mega, mod and the mini. I loved the mod and it was more than enough for one. I added the toppings I enjoy.... With the extensive toppings I forgot to add spinach!Overall pizza was cooked to my liking and it was delicious. I would definitely try again this time with white sauce and grilled chicken!"}
{"text":"I work at Tempe Marketplace and am always looking for new places to eat. I saw on Yelp that MOD was finally open and stopped by to pick up a pizza on my lunch break. Kai and Hector were both super friendly and helpful! My pizza was delicious and I had plenty for leftovers to eat later. Their lemonades and teas are super good, I made an Arnold Palmer with the berry lemonade and pear tea. Yum.  Pro tip: Tempe Marketplace employees get 15% off, so a huge pizza ends up only being $7. Woot!"}
{"text":"Ok first off we love this place!!! We love the marionberry lemonade.(we love anything from Portland ) one of our Littles is a super picky eater and won't eat anything with sauce ( she's on a lube free diet) or if one food touches another food so in pizza ' s case it was a double no go it has lube, and everything touches....however here because she feels a little more in control with saying light sauce and watching them fill her pizza layer by layer it allowed her to want to try it....well now thanks to MOD she will eat pizza her diet has expanded!  HOWEVER the ladies room (I can't speak for the men's I haven't visited there, although now legally I think I can thanks Obama!) -ok yah the ladies room is NASTY the toilet has this weird orange ish ring around the inner bowl it's kinda grosser then a truck stop bathroom! It's just gross in there, it's super busy but that kind of thing in the porcelain throne doesn't happen in a day so that tells me it's been a while since ol Johnnie has had a good inner scrubbing, which more then likely goes the same for the outters, and the sink and the floor. If the employees don't want to do it they have commercial cleaning companies that will! CLEAN YO NASTY RESTROOMS!! PRETTY PLEASE!!!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! What more can you ask for-- customizable pizza  food is great but service is much better. Mike the GM was a gem and exemplifies customer service! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Make your own pizza, they don't charge for the amount of toppings you want. $8 for 11\" pie with whatever you want on it. It's is a great deal. I got gluten free crust (add'l cost), and it tasted amazing. My girls loved their pizza as well. We'll definitely return for more. My only issue, is their chairs didn't fit my big behind. My daughters were slightly uncomfortable in the seats too. They do offer stools at the high tables and a bar along the window."}
{"text":"i thought this was jiffy lube it was a pizza place but i lowkey loved it mamma mia pappa pia"}
{"text":"Pizza is really good.  You pick your size and add all the toppings you want!  No nickeling and diming you for each topping!  They slide it in the oven and is ready in u dear 10 minutes.  I recommend this type of pizza place for lunch.  I don't recommend this place if you have infants or a couple of small children .  Not a lot of low table that can accommodate high chairs and booster seats.  Just a lot of bar tables.   Every single high chair that we picked had all the screws loose or missing.  Not safe for babies at all.  If you take the risk please double check the high chairs!"}
{"text":"HUGE shout out to Katrice for going above and beyond for her customers-we would come back here just for her! Luckily, the food is outstanding as well, we enjoyed both the pizza and the salads. I'm picky so the very customizable nature of the place was perfect for me. The price was more than reasonable too. I wish it was local, but my understanding is that they treat their employees well and give people a second chance who might not get hired at other places, which is great too. Highly recommend for a casual but awesome dinner!"}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times and it's always consistent. The staff is friendly and I like the seating options (booth, high top communal tables and a nice small outdoor patio). I'm on a \"get ready for summer diet\" so Mod is a great choice for our family as the kids can have their own personal pizza and me and the hubby can have a salad and share a thin crust Mod sized pie. Price is average. I would recommend getting the fountain drinks versus the bottles sodas. And it's always a good idea to order a cold cup of Old Meck Copper!"}
{"text":"The service was wonderful and the pizza is even better. 10/10 would come back!!! Everyone is so nice. The location was not too busy at all, but the employees made us feel like the only people in there. The pizza and ingredients were fresh. The beer is good. Come to Mod at Tempe market place! Brand new location!"}
{"text":"The great people who work here really make this place. Yeah the pizza and salad are da bomb too ;)"}
{"text":"9 different combos for pizza and 3 different salads... If that's not enough then you can pick and choose... Choices of sauce cheese meats vegetables... I saw someone ping up a pyramid of meats before moving to next station... Brick oven and comes out in couple of minutes since the dough is already pre baked... All less than $8 each...wonder how they make money... Very professional staff"}
{"text":"So I'm torn on this one between 3 and 4 stars but don't feel warm and fuzzy throwing a 4 out for the world to see. Like someone here will totally second guess my 4 if they choose a bad pizza.    So first the pizza.  Their gluten free crust isn't very good. It's average at best from the crust my wife has had. My pizza, I got the Calexico which is a blend of chicken, Gorgonzola and buffalo sauce. Overall it was pretty good. One issue though is they didn't let the pizza cook all the way through so the crust wasn't cooked all the way through. That would have helped on that other half star.    Salads, seriously. They have some awesome salads and the Italian dressing is awesome. I basically took their simple salad and turned it into a Mediterranean salad with ham and salami SCORE! They let you add on to them and they are fantastically priced. Serious score guys. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"\m/ MOD PIZZA RULES. \m/  When you ask for balsamic glaze to go for your pizza, MAKE SURE ITS NOT CHOCOLATE SAUCE!!! FOR CHRIST SAKE LABEL THE DAMN THING WILL YOU!!!    2nd time this has happened at this location.  I still have Mod love for this place. Next time, it gets ugly, capeesh?"}
{"text":"My husband and I love MOD Pizza! We probably go there every couple of weeks when we need a break from our usual paleo-type diet. They have delicious and affordable gluten-free and dairy free options (~$10/gluten free pizza). They are generous with the unlimited toppings and rotate different ingredients now and then (all are included in the price of build-your own style). The pizza tastes great, but the best part about MOD, at least at this location in particular, is their customer service. They are always super friendly, pretty fast in the mid-late evenings when we go, and occasionally offer us a drink if it takes a while or even a free pizza on occasion if they accidentally mixed up our order or made a mistake. We once had a credit card issue with an online order getting a double charge and the cashier/manager gave us his name and number just in case it didn't get resolved on their end so that he could clear the charge the next day. They are the kind of business that make you wish all businesses were like this. Everybody makes mistakes now and then, but the way they are handled is what counts. We love MOD!"}
{"text":"I have tried this location a few times... I get to be gluten free.. And theirs is pretty darn good!  And generous.  Probably double the usual gluten free sizes out there.   Between the very welcoming peeps who work here... The very generous and yummy pizza for a great price. Makes me say hoo-ya!   Worth the price of admission for sure"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. The staff is extremely kind and the pizza is always cooked to perfection and made in a quick, efficient amount of time. I usually call ahead to order and my order is always ready and done perfectly when I get there. I would recommend this place to anyone who likes pizza and or salad because you can get an almost unlimited amount of toppings and it's always the same reasonable price."}
{"text":"The pizza here is so good and never disappoints. But lately the customer service here is HORRIBLE. The workers are so rude and literally roll their eyes as you order. One employee specifically with pink and blue and her hair is so rude . She was rolling her eyes and making comments to the people ahead of me and my husband."}
{"text":"They are always so friendly in here! The food is delicious and I go every week. No matter the combination, I've always left extremely satisfied."}
{"text":"Good, fast, friendly! What else can you ask for. Awesome happy hour deals and reasonable pricing at any hour. They don't do the per topping price thing so wether you want it with just sauce or loaded with everything they've got, it's all the same. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is clean and modern. Of course the pizza, they use one of those high temp hot ovens that bakes your selection super fast, only then do you get that thin crust char and crunch. If you're sharing for two, the MOD pizza and MOD salad go great, won't leave you stuffed, if you're really hungry, you may need to go with the \"mega\" which I believe is a thicker version... Either way you're in for a treat! Finally a good \"neopolitan\" style pizza place in arrowhead! No need to drive MILES to find one. Good eating!"}
{"text":"I am updating my review and increasing my rating.  MOD Pizza contacted me and offered me a free meal to compensate for my less than perfect experience.  They stated that they were taking my feedback into consideration.  I did not respond because I did not write my review to get free food, but I do appreciate that those who make the decisions care enough to take customer reviews into consideration.  I hope that the information I gave was helpful to them and that they can use it to benefit their business.  ***  The pizza was fine - nothing terribly special.    I did not like the way that the restaurant was set up.  Given, the space is limited but you should not have your guests arriving, standing in line, eating, cleaning up and leaving all in the same area of your facility.  We sat at a table where the line wrapped around us.  We tried to clean up, but the garbage station was blocked by the line.  It was very frustrating and allowed for no privacy when eating and chatting.  My main issue was that when I paid for my meal with a debit card, the cashier stared me down for not leaving a tip.  If I have to stand in line to order my food, stand at a counter waiting for someone to yell out my name, carry my food to the table that I have to find, refill my own drink and clean up my mess, I am not leaving a tip.  I paid for the pizza itself, but I received no service beyond my product.  Tips are for service.  Do not look at me like I am an alien because I did not pay you for something you did not do.  If you eat at any other restaurant, you do not tip the chef, you tip the waiter/busser.  Since there is no waiter at MOD pizza, there will be no tip, either."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I thought it was delicious, fast, and a great concept. I had put in an online order and when i showed up, they were standing around and hadn't even started it yet. Granted, it didn't take long to cook and it was nice to be there ordering in person but it would've been nice to see them at least working or beginning on my order. They were super nice and helpful though, my guess is they prepare orders minutes before a person picks up to prevent pizza sitting too long. I had no idea you could put a gazillion toppings for the same price. I will definitely go again. The only other thing I'd mention is I got terrible gastrointestinal issues later that evening so I had to ask myself if maybe the temperatures in which the food is stored is appropriate? As a consumer, it is certainly a thought that comes across my head when I'm visiting the bathroom back to back. I still loved the food, no doubt. I wouldn't lower the stars based on bathroom trips because it could've been anything technically!"}
{"text":"Hello my name is Bo, and I am loyal Modder for life.  Mod Pizza is my go-to pizza joint. They have the BEST crew who always knows when i come in. They have the BEST toppings. Over 9000 combinations you can customize. Did i Mention you can make the sauce white, pesto, and buffalo? This place is heaven on earth.   I recommend getting your favorite pizza and pairing it with some delicious house made Teas and Lemonades.   In the mood to dip your pizza? They have tons of options like ranch and buffalo sauce for the perfect dipping experience.   Highly recommend coating your crust with garlic butter and parm! You won't regret going to Mod Pizza!  Did I mention this place is super cheap? Unlimitted topping large pizza for like $8. Or get the mini pizza (my favorite) for like $5. Where can you get a pizza with literally unlimitted toppings for $5?   It doesn't stop there. The crew makes to die for desserts. And if you ask i'm sure they'll be more than happy to add extra love to yours.   Don't believe me? Try it yourself. Add your review to this one if you think i'm wrong. :)"}
{"text":"Mod pizza is amazing. First time here and the food is fantastic but the staff is even better. from the greeting at the do or, making of our pizza and the  follow up while we were eating. for a place for a quick bite the service is better than some high end restaurants in town.  The pizza is a perfect thin crust. No extra charge for toppings so load it up. Great service, food and pricing."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time ordering form this location and I must say I am surprised with the quality of the ingredients and the red sauce for the price they charge! Also Free unlimited toppings so  I will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"ALWAYS amazing service!! I love how there isnt an upcharge for the toppings and you can create your own yummy pizza. It tastes soooooo good!!"}
{"text":"We have been here 3 times now, and they just opened last week!!  The staff is great, cool industrial feel, nice being able to watch them assemble your pizza. I like that you can get as many, or as much, toppings as you like-all for the same reasonable price. Great!!  The gluten-free crust is delicious!!! My husband and daughter are GF. We have searched high and low for good GF pizza in Gilbert-and have finally found it!! It's so good we ALL get the GF crust now!!  The salad is also customizable-add whatever you like-all the same price.  They give free samples of milkshakes, have generous portions, good service-friendly and attentive.   Love, love, love MOD!! Try it and see for yourself-you'll love it too!"}
{"text":"I cannot imagine how at noon in uptown Scottsdale this place still has no line and reasonable prices. How is this still an undiscovered treasure?"}
{"text":"MOD Pizza is wonderful. My husband and I tried it for the first time Monday night, and it was great. You can add as many toppings as you want for no additional cost, and, by golly, we did. One of our pizzas had ham, pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, and Asiago cheese. They actually managed to cook it long enough even though there were tons of toppings. The crust was a nice balance between crispy and soft--it had a crunch, but it was still foldable. The other pizza we bought was just pepperoni, and that was awesome as well."}
{"text":"I really love this place but my only complaint is that some of the makers will put way too much sauce on the pie."}
{"text":"Mod pizza is very good. They offer 2 sizes so you dont have to order something that is too big. You pick the toppings and it fresh and fast. Ice tea is very good as well."}
{"text":"This is my second time going to a mod pizza. I liked the experience much more than my first time at the Tanger Outletslocation; the only issue at Tanger was with the young employees on their phones or with an attitude (Dec 2014). My second visit, first time this locatuon, was great, pizza tasted awesome and fresh. I love the thin crust and will continue to come back here especially for the same price on any pizza with any topping. The best feature!"}
{"text":"Crispy crust with yummy toppings make this a go to pizza place. The customer service was awesome, they were very patient as I had a hard time making up my mind and gave me ideas to make just the right pizza pie. The prices were very good, the place was crowded, but they kept the tables bussed and cleaned quickly. The all meat pizza my hubby had was the bob diggity, I know because I had to steal a bite. You will not be disappointed, give it a try."}
{"text":"Had it today for the first time. I had the mod sized cheese pizza to see what that was like alone. It was amazing. One of the best pizzas I've ever had in Arizona. For such a quick baked pizza, they do more well than these other franchised places you see. That says a lot about a pizza. You know what else says a lot about a pizza? When that cheese is so frikkn stretchy and it just keeps going and going while you're biting at it. Unlike other places the cheese frikkn comes off. I was pretty impressed, and I grew up in New Jersey and New York, where we had the most amazing frikkn pizza. MOD pizza was hands down one of the best pizza places I've had here."}
{"text":"Perfect place to be selfish when you don't want to compromise on pizza toppings! They have plenty of meat, fresh veggies, cheese and sauce options to make anyone happy. The line always moves quickly and it takes less than five minutes to cook. The service is always super friendly and they don't mind you asking for more of your favorite topping either! The crust is on the thinner side, but still tastes great. I love to mix their regular and raspberry lemonades for the perfect drink to compliment!"}
{"text":"What's better than pizza? Getting to design your own pizza! MOD sells three different sizes of pizza for all ages and appetites; I normally go for the middle one. They have tons of options to choose from pesto to red sauce, ricotta to mozzarella cheese, pepperoni to spicy chicken sausage, and veggies to your hearts content. If you're feeling extra adventurous, feel free to top the pizza with any of the 6+ dipping sauces. The line moves fairly quickly and the pizza is cooked in 8 min or less. There's ample parking and service is always friendly (and patient) while you get creative. My only gripe is that they don't serve goat cheese as an option- I'd love that!"}
{"text":"We have been going to this Mod Pizza for several months. I can't say enough good things about it. Always friendly (which is nice) but the true star is the pizza. It is always superb and delicious and looks awesome when you open the box! I love that you can put whatever you want on the pizza without any up charges - extra pepperoni?  Gorgonzola cheese? Sun dried tomatoes? Asparagus? Peppers? Etc, etc, etc? Yes, yes, yes and no - no extra charge! Even my super picky mother-in-law LOVES this pizza, enough said!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints and has risen to the top of my list of choices in dining out for a meal that is quick, quality, and inexpensive.  Pizza is unbelievable, the employees are very friendly, no bad reviews on multiple visits to this establishment. The ingredients are fresh, plentiful, the dough is great - I give this place 10 stars if you could rate higher  Again greatest pizza and prices in town"}
{"text":"When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's ...uh... (can I have some) more, eh?  Excellent pizza. Crispy thin crust. Unique toppings and sauces. Fast service and good atmosphere. I haven't tried it yet, but they have a gluten free crust too."}
{"text":"Customer service was fantastic! Chris was very helpful in choosing toppings for my pizza and was baked to perfection! Would definitely recommend to friends!!!"}
{"text":"Small custom pizza.  The good: fast and same price no matter how many toppings you get. Staff is friendly: The bad: crust is average topping quality is average.  I would say this is a glorified flatiza (from Subway) ."}
{"text":"Really confused about this place. They told me they cater to vegans but every time I go its something new. First they said red sauce was ok, then next time they said no it has cheese do bbq. The next time I went they told me the crust has egg. Last time there was a piece of meat in my food. The funny part is EACH time I have come in, the worker has told me they are also vegan when I mentioned that I was. 3 different people yet they all still gave me non- vegan things. I guess I will be going to POMO, NYPD, or Mellow Mushroom since this has occured on multiple occasions. I know they opened recently, but still thats a shame."}
{"text":"Excellent! We seek out MOD Pizza when we travel because we don't have one near our home town. If you aren't happy with your food, it is your own fault because you choose what goes on it and how much."}
{"text":"Definitely worth going to.  I love the fact that they have gluten free crust option.  And the amount of toppings you can put on is awesome. I've been there a couple times and there was a simple error or confusion, which is understandable since they just opened, however, every time they are offering a free beverage and the last time they made a mistake with the pizza and instead of throwing it out, they gave it to me anyhow and redid the pizza.  Pure awesomeness."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would!!!!  I work down the street and tried to run in on my lunch break.  This should not have been an issue as there were only 3 people ahead of me in line.  All I ordered was a small cheese pizza.  They have one person cashing you out and cooking the pizza and 2 that help create them.  I asked if he could put my pizza in as I had to go back to work.  He did not.  He was backed up in every direction.  Then he put about 10 pizzas in.  When he finally took them out, the one that should have been mine he tried to give to another person.  I waited.  He then passed out several other pizzas - to people who had not even paid yet.  I still waited.  Finally I asked if he could put the one that was mine in a box so I could go.  He could not find the paper, therefore he would not give it to me.  I finally just asked for a refund... Which he did give me (just for the pizza...).  20 minutes for nothing... For a pizza that should have taken 5 minutes!  I will NEVER go to a MOD pizza again!  This was horrible!"}
{"text":"Good lord this was bad. Dry, doughy, light on ingredients. Caesar salad was fine. Service was good. I'm probably not going to be back though. Too many other options out there."}
{"text":"My kids love this place. Staff is super friendly. Wish they had more adventurous toppings.  Loved the Brussels sprouts and ricotta when they first opened.  A fig and prosciutto would be yummy too."}
{"text":"Mod is always a staple for us. Reliably good food. Friendly staff. Quick and easy! The local beer on tap just adds to the awesomeness. We'll keep coming back most definitely!"}
{"text":"Usually great service here - except tonight. The guy building my pizza seemed to be irritated and rude. I asked for extra mozzarella cheese and he tells me he will add it at the end of the line. He said they add it after all the toppings so it cooks evenly. Fair enough. I asked for onions on the pizza - so he puts 5 slices. I asked if he can add some more - he did but not without the bad attitude ( like adding a few more slices was too much damn work).  5 more slices. Wow.  It wasn't like I was asking him to build a tower. We get to the end of the line and I ask if one tub was the mozzarella and he says \"The makes of the cheeses are down there\". OK. No mozzarella. So I pick the Asiago and with the same attitude and irritated look, puts the cheese on.  This place is suppose to put whatever you want on your pizza. Not give you some sort of attitude when you want this or that or an extra few slices of something.  Again, I usually get great service at this place. Not this time. Night out with my kid was ruined because of this one employee. The others were great as always.  Maybe I'll try again. Maybe not. Dining out is suppose to be fun."}
{"text":"It is only fair to update when a restaurant proves they have listened to a bad reciew. MOD listened. My wife had wonderful service her pizza was cooked perfectly and we are really happy they are in our neighborhood ."}
{"text":"MOD is a go-to for great, inexpensive pizza that doesn't taste like something you pulled from the back of your freezer on a lonely Friday night. Their crust is thinner, with the perfect combination of chewy/crispy, and you can get unlimited toppings, mix and match sauces, and do different drizzles letting you be your own pizza connoisseur. For someone who can never decide, this is both a blessing and a curse. You can also do the same thing with their salads, mixing and matching to your heart's content (but sometimes they go a little over board on the blue cheese dressing, which is literally my only complaint.) Dessert pizzas and shakes are also a must, especially the lemonades. Whatever you get here, you won't be disappointed and with how cost-friendly everything is, you can kiss Little Caesars goodbye.   Oh, and the staff are always very extra friendly. It makes for a fun environment."}
{"text":"Nice local alternative to Fired Pie, but more focused and organized! Big fan! (PLUS, Devil's Ale on tap!!!)"}
{"text":"Perhaps I'm easily impressed. Or, perhaps the pizza and options at MOD Pizza are simply exceptional. Considering that my girlfriend and I ate at MOD Pizza before we left town for Vegas, AND after we returned, I'm starting to think MOD is more than exceptional.  Like most of the places that we choose to dine at, our first meal at MOD Pizza was selected due to proximity and intuition. This was a very fortunate, uneducated decision.  The staff at MOD Pizza have been very friendly on both our visits. They take the time to explain the options and make sure you have everything you want for your meal. Of course you can chose whatever toppings you want, or select one of their pre-determined combinations. The toppings are amazing, very fresh and creative.  And it's a great value! Your pizza options include an 11 inch personal pizza or a smaller version. Add a very unique salad and you're set. Oh, and don't forget their tempting selection of bottled sodas, juices, or beer and wine on draft!  The fact that the crust is amazing is a good place to start. My girlfriend has a new favorite pizza, the Crosby, and she selected it on her first visit. It sounds unusual, but the fig glaze complements it well. I've tried the Calexico and the Dillon James and both were very enjoyable. And the Boylan (real sugar cane) sodas are a trip back to memory lane.  I've reviewed other quick pizza joints. And they were decent. I also referred to the concept as a fad. MOD Pizza is by far, my favorite. I hope they weather the competition and stick around a while."}
{"text":"The idea isn't new, but the type of food is! Build your own pizza - fast, quick, fresh, and delicious, what more could you ask of a lunch or dinner?  Pizzas come in 3 sizes which is great if you want to make MOD a new lunch destination!  Combine that with an atmosphere with friendly staff who appear truly happy to see you walk in the door and I can guarantee MOD is going to be a food stop we continue to frequent regularly!"}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed with this place after going to other similar places. Tons of different things on the menu and at the bar it was a little overwhelming. We ate here because we had people with dietary restrictions (gluten free and vegan) which everyone was able to get a good pizza regardless."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time and I have to say I was impressed. The MOD size pizza is pretty much your standard size personal pizza and seemed like the more popular choice.  You can choose your sauce and you only get mozzarella cheese on your pizza (I don't mind but if you're one of those picky people, then you're SOL). They have a ton of options for meat including chorizo! You can have chorizo on your pizza. Then a wise variety of veggies and other fun toppings.  It didn't take too long for my pizza to be baked. I did go during a dinner rush on a Friday night so I knew it was going to be a bit busy.  They have this lemonade (and I wish I could remember what it was called but it was sort of reddish) and I know you only die for your country and family, but if you had to did for a beverage, this lemonade would be the one.  The place is pretty hip and cool and the pizza is really good. I will definitely be back to test out new toppings."}
{"text":"Thin crust and fresh salad. Everything is customized, build your own like the sandwich shops.  The service is friendly and fast and they have beer and wine on tap. What more do you need?  No wait staff and I didn't see anyone cleaning tables but over all the place was new and clean."}
{"text":"This young man randy vanmeter the manager is the hardest give it your all guy. This man runs this,store like it is his very own bussiness.He treats his workers with dignity n respect.He works almost 6 days aweek for mod.hes works morning noon n night. His work ethics are outstanding.please show him hes,worth it.hes a power house. I really pray this company mod pizza appreciates him.outstanding young man."}
{"text":"SO YUMMY! I have been to a similar place in California so I was excited to drive past this place yesterday and even more excited that my hubby wanted to try it for dinner! It's a great concept for a great price. The staff seemed tired and there definitely weren't enough people there to cover the needs of the customers. We got 2 pizzas, a drink and a beer for under $30. Oh, they have Papago Orange Blossom on tap which is the best beer ever! Their ice teas were super delish but my favorite was the Caramelized Pear... I could drink a gallon of that! And to top it off they have the best ice too! Overall a good experience and we would go back but do a few things differently. I would ask for mine to be cooked longer, the crust was a little soggy and my hubby would not spring for the mega pizza as it was a let down but he would have been happy with just the mod style."}
{"text":"Love this concept but the service and quality is inconsistent.   I love that we can custom create our pizza but sometimes the crust is not so awesome. I was told to ask for it cooked longer but it has come out burnt too.   There are quite a few \"copies\" of this chain so I'll keep coming back unless I find something consistently better.   Oh, the carmelized pear ice tea is SOOOO good, best ice ever and they serve Papago orange blossom. Can't go wrong there."}
{"text":"This place is our new favorite.   You pick all the toppings you want and pay one price.  We will be back a lot."}
{"text":"They have crushed ice, so there is that. Always staffed great so you are waited on super fast. Pizza is thin crust and yum. Always friendly there and welcoming"}
{"text":"Wanted to try and compare to Fired Pie, this place doesn't come close.  Just had no flavor, red sauce very bland and topping choices are less and also just like Subway. At fired pie, they roast mushrooms, carmelize onions and more better \"proteins\".  These pizzas seem a little smaller as well.  Worth a try but won't go back.   Just a note: I saw a salad being made, it's small!!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible, how can a company serve such a raw pizza? Worst part of all I asked for it to be crispy!!! Everyone save yourself the time and go to fired pie I don't live near one so I tried out this mod place and I think I'm gonna be sick for a couple days!"}
{"text":"This location used to be our go to Mod due to how conveniently located it was to our home. Unfortunately the past two visits my husband and I both got sick. First time just I did so I figured maybe  I was just sensitive to the food but the second time my husband and I both were sick into the next day. I am writing this review in hopes that it will bring attention to the store manager on proper food handling. Still enjoy the company very much but unlikely to visit this location."}
{"text":"Always our go to place where everyone can get what they want. This location is by far the best compared to others. It is always clean and the food is always fresh."}
{"text":"I was impressed by this pizza place. I just moved nearby and was craving pizza and I this was within  walking distance. It wasn't busy and we got our pizza within a reasonable time. The only hang-up was that when we tried calling the number that was listed didn't work."}
{"text":"Visit the area and came with the family. Great price, amazing service, delicious pizza. They even gave us some free shakes for the kids. Will come back again."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in here one afternoon for lunch for our first MOD Pizza experience.  Certainly a different way of ordering a pizza - step up to a counter let them know what you want as they make it right there in front of you (almost Subway like) and one price for all the topping you would like.  I went for a simple MOD sized pizza with tomatoes and basil.  The crust is thin and is cooked in a brick oven - the oven is gas fired so do not expect any extra flavor on your pizza.  The pizza I had was very good.  My wife had one of the pizzas where they put a your salad on top once the crust is cooked.  She was a little surprised by the concept was pleasantly pleased with it.    Overall a good place to eat, with friendly employees and clean restrooms."}
{"text":"Tasty personal pizza for a reasonable price. No extra charge for more toppings. Big enough to fill you up, but you don't leave feeling about to burst. Have them mix the red and white sauce. Don't forget to have them sprinkle some rosemary on your pizza too!"}
{"text":"I went here with my best friend one night when we were hungry. You can either get a small pizza or a medium/big one. You make it how you like or you choose one on the menu and you can alter it to your liking. This place was pretty cool. I think there is another place where you can do this. It's called humble pie. But I haven't been yet. But I really enjoyed this. I got my own personal pizza with like 4 slices. I think I got like a ham one or something. It's also thin crust. It's a decent sized place too right near zupas. And as soon as you walk in you can feel the hipster vibe. And personally I love places like that.  if you like pizza and you like a personalized one with thin crust and a size just for you, then check it out! I'll probably be back when I crave pizza."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE MOD!  Had my first experience in Seattle a few years ago and has become a staple everytime I travel there...now to have one 5 minutes from my home OMG!    Great fired, thin crust Pizza...combinations are endless, you can choose to build your own, or why mess with perfection order straight from the menu.  Get here now, once people realize what they have in their neighborhood, this place will be standing room only!"}
{"text":"What a shame. Came to get some pizza after a hard days work only to find that they were having a \"yelp\" event for their regular customers... whatever that means. Been eating here once a week.  \"Oh you can eat on the patio\" um it's 106 and 90% humidity. Thanks no.  Nice way to treat customers hope your \"yelp\" event goes well.  Yep didn't help us find you. But it will stop us from coming back. Good luck."}
{"text":"Pizza is good.  Super fast. Better than fast food pizza.  Here you can get what you want on your pizza more of a personal style pizza.  The mega feeds about 2 people.  Like the atmosphere nice music kick back place.  The make a pizza called Mod, that's 2 of there pizza staked on top of each other with cheese and sauce.  Crazy right  there like a Mexican pizza from Taco Bell, trust me much better. Give it a try"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza we've found in the area. Order what ever you want on your pizza, regardless of the size and it's the same price. Delicious thin, crisp crust... oodles of fresh ingredients. Even the \"gourmet\" ingredients that most places charge extra for are all included here. Love this place!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible and the food was mediocre at best.   When the preparer passed us our salad and we said we requested it to go she grabbed it and slammed it down so that food came out of the bowl. Not sure why she was irritated at us.  The manager was in the way of the food pick up talking sports the whole time we were waiting.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"Quick and easy. Salad option allows to you add as much of your favorite toppings. They are generous with the toppings and try to make it just like you want. The fig basalmic glaze is delicious!"}
{"text":"Awesome quick pizza place..  Nice crisp thin crust as many toppings as you want at no extra cost. It's kind of like a fast food pizza place but nicer. They do serve a couple of beers."}
{"text":"Love,love,love mod pizza!!!! Put as many toppings as you want at no extra cost... it's fast and yummy...outside seating... with a very fare pricing ohhh yeah $2 craft beer on Tuesday's."}
{"text":"This place is so good! I love how they have different sizes of pizza you can choose from and the topping selection looks very fresh. The employees are very friendly. I will most definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try something new. We've seen the MOD in Gilbert but happened to be on the other side of town so we tried this location. Pretty cute inside, decent menu. We had the BBQ pizza. Eh... What made this trip memorable was our server, Tamara. Even though the food was good, she made our visit stand out. She was attentive, made food suggestions and even joked around with us. We will go back to this location!"}
{"text":"I loved the concept of this place! The red sauce was not my favorite, but the white sauce was delicious! You can get a mini pizza for around $5 with as many toppings as you want! The food would get 5 stars, but they lost a star for customer service. As soon as I walked in, the lady behind the counter was not friendly. I had never been here before and she did not seem willing to waste her time answering questions. The first thing she says to me is \"red sauce and cheese?\" I did not know what I wanted at that point, so I asked her if I could look first. She said \"okay, but you need to pick a sauce.\" Yes, I know. She seemed to be in a hurry and there was nobody even behind me. Rude! They guy at the register was more patient and friendly. Overall, food was great and cheap and they have beer on tap, so I will be back. Just make sure you look over the menu before you arrive."}
{"text":"First time here place is clean simple.. Smells Delish. Pepperoni pizza/ \"Mad Dog\" was awesome. The ambiance is calm. Staff was extremely friendly and welcoming. Tons of fresh veggies and sauces to put on your pizza. They even had Pesto gotta try it next time."}
{"text":"I needed to grab a fast lunch and, after doing a quick Yelp scan, selected MOD pizza. I'm so happy i discovered this place!!   I went in, was immediately greeted, and was pleased to see they had a personal/mini 6-inch size pizza, which was perfect for me.   The price is the same whether you select one ingredient or many. And there are MANY to choose from.  I let the pizza guy know what I wanted on my pie and he assembled while I watched. In no time flat my little pizza was done.   Delish!! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Let me say this place is fire. Me and my roomamte stoped in right as they opened and got greeted right away. The service was on point let me tell you. And the pizza is good the crust is perfect and the you get to pick all the amazing toppings you want. Shout out to the team over here the are killing it"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Mod Pizza! Fresh ingredients and you see it made right in front of you! customer service is amazing and Keishah is so cute and and friendly!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza at a pretty good price.  We would come back here again.  I really liked the balsamic drizzled pizza I had. The Olivia, I think it was? I removed the tomatoes but other than that, it was great. Unique pizza that I haven't seen or had anywhere else.    Overall, the service was friendly and the price was very good."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Loved the staff super friendly and took my girlfriend here for lunch and she was super satisfied!"}
{"text":"This place opened up near my house awhile ago and has become a STAPLE in my house! A unique concept, you can pick the size (the mini is the perfect size for one person!) and customize each pizza with exactly what you want. The best part is you pay for the size you choose, NOT each topping you pick! The dough is fresh, the sauce is delicious and the topping selection is abundant. Baked in a brick oven, the pizza's are crispy, and you can top it off with a drizzle of your favorite sauce after it's done. A ranch drizzle over a veggie pizza... try it, you won't be disappointed!   Highly recommend this place, the staff is super friendly, very affordable, and DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"MOD Pizza is fantastic for make-your-own pie.  I have been to multiple locations, and Arcadia is my favorite during this time of year.  They have a great outdoor space to enjoy the weather and great food.    Also, they have $2 draft beer on Tuesday.  That's a deal that can't be beat."}
{"text":"This is a great new location for MOD Pizza!!!  The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.  I can't wait to go back and try this location again."}
{"text":"I'm updating this because my boyfriend and I came in again probably 15 minutes before close (sorry, we know!) but the girl who was working, Ashley, was SO kind - it definitely made up for the horrific service last time.  We never felt like burdens for coming in so close to closing time. Definitely come in here. :)"}
{"text":"These 3 minute make your own pizza for $8 places are springing up all over town.  For the most part they are indistinguishable from one another.   This one is from the Northwest so it has a more hipster bearded feel about it. A solid weeknight option when the family wants a quick neighborhood pizza.   A half step below in quality and variety from Sauce."}
{"text":"This place has been great. I stopped by on a whim when it wasn't busy and the staff were really friendly. I like that its one price and you add whatever toppings you want - and they have a great selection of toppings."}
{"text":"Great little pizza joint!  All pizzas are one price regardless of toppings. ..fabulous.  The pizza was very well cooked with a nice thin crust with just the right amount of char. We had a red and a white pizza and both were excellent. The sauce was flavorful and the toppings were plentiful and fresh.  We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Seriously the best pizza place around hands down.  So many different choices with the best crust a pizza can have.  All of the pizza is cooked in a brick oven within minutes.  Really fast even if there is a line to order.  I will be going again with the whole family real soon."}
{"text":"I am impressed with MOD pizza.  I want to say that the only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is for the seating and comfort of the restaurant, but more about that later.  MOD is a design your own pizza restaurant with just a few other offerings such as salads and milk shakes.  Think of it as a subway or Chipotle of pizza.  The menu is limited so if you don't want pizza, go elsewhere.  When we were there, the line was long and out the door so come at off times if you don't want to wait.  There is pretty much every type of topping you can think of.  The only topping they didn't have was green olives, which I would love if they added.  There are suggested pizzas but you are free to pick your own as well; just pick a sauce, a cheese, veggies, meats and finishes.  You are free to pick as much or little as you want and you pay the same price depending on what size you choose.  The prices are very affordable.  The pizza moves downy he line with you and then gets fired in a (coal, I believe) oven.  It takes about 5-7 minutes to complete and then voila, your pizza is ready.  The crust is a little bit like a lavosh crust, not a typical pizza crust, but still tasty.  I really enjoyed the pizza I made; red sauce with mozzarella, artichokes, mushrooms, black olives, basil and spinach with a pesto drizzle.  It was delicious.  We also shared a caesar salad which was good too.  As far as seating, this is where I would love an improvement.  The seating areas are small with some high top tables and a few booths.  The problem is the boots are smack where the line is so you have people on either side of you watching you eat while they are standing on line.  It is pretty uncomfortable.  There is a patio outside with misters and wire patio furniture as well.  Not exactly comfortable, especially in the summer.  I just wish this restaurant was bigger with better seating.  This is not the kind of place I will bring my parents or grandmother for that matter as they won't find it comfortable.  I can't wait to come back and try all the different combinations of pizza I can think of."}
{"text":"Stopped for late lunch.  They make your pizza right in front of you. Nice suggested pizzas or make what you want. Nice thin crispy crust and pretty good value. Nice selection of toppings and good taste.  Have some beer on tap too."}
{"text":"It's fast and the pizza is good at an affordable price. If I could I would give their employees and customer service 100 stars! They are the friendliest group of people I have ever experienced at any restaurant. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very tasty. Good price great food. Friendly service. Love the ability to customize. Very good tea and lemonade options on tap!"}
{"text":"the restaurant was a cookie cutter Style strip mall venue. this created a very loud atmosphere no sound dampening in the ceiling or walls. the pizza was a flatbread thin crust Style with choices of many different toppings. relatively quickly they were able to load up the pizza with you you're different choices and throw it into a oven. flat thin crust pizza it's not my usual choice and there was not a second choice or any other choice in crust."}
{"text":"What took me so long   I went to MOD for dinner last night with my sister and nephew and I have to admit we really enjoyed our meals.  MOD has the same concept which is similar to Chipotle.  You create your very own pizza masterpiece.  MOD, has an assembly line concept for Pizza or salad if you  prefer.  You walk up to the counter and walk down the line.  As you walk down the line you tell the Pizza cooks what to add to your pizza.  The price remains the same reguardless of what or how many topping  you add to your pizza.  I ordered a pie with tomato sauce, ricotta, mozzarella, roasted peppers, pepperoni and spicy sausage.  My sister and nephew  ordered similar but with a couple of topping changes.   The line moved very quickly so we built or pizza creations, paid, and filled our drinks.  The pizzas came about seven minutes after that.  MOD offers a good selection of fresh meats, cheeses, and vegetables and the  prices are modest. In addition, to great pizza MOD has amazing milkshakes and beer for the adults.  The staff is friendly, accomadating,  the food is good, and at a reasonable price.   If your in the area give it a try."}
{"text":"The staff are 5 stars very thorough on explanations and give you good substitutions. Very personable I feel like I'm at home more than a restaurant which I is perfect for me. Foods great drink selection good enough to please anyone. Will be back for sure. The 3 staff members work perfect together as well just a Really good positive vibe!"}
{"text":"I looked forward to trying the new Mod Pizza near my home.  Went Friday evening about 5:30PM.  It was relatively quiet with just a hand-full of diners, lots of empty tables to choose from.  I noted a some what spartan environment, a lot of wood and metal and a high ceiling and large windows with a long counter with 4 or 5 servers standing behind many stainless trays containing dozens and dozens of toppings to choose from (all for one price). Everything was clean and the staff extra friendly.  A beverage machine served the usual sodas and iced tea for 1.97  The pizza was extra thin (11 inch), creating an \"eating problem\".  It was difficult to pick up having no self support and with the available flimsy plastic knives and forks it was very difficult to cut and get on your fork.  They would put on as many toppings as you request and as much as you would like.  All appeared to be fresh and of good quality but some how had little flavor.  I thought it was because the red sauce was too thin.  We ordered a second pizza, with more sauce and more cheese but it didn't help.  I really wanted it to be good but it failed IMO.  We won't return, too bad, it's a nice concept."}
{"text":"I love the idea of making your own pizza and the best part- the toppings don't cost extra! They have amazing lemonade, great staff, and I really don't have much negative to say! Great for a casual, quick dinner!"}
{"text":"I had the worst customer service ever at this place. I wanted to try the salad there, because I was told they were better than Fired Pie, yeah right!!!!!!! The lettuce was old and yellow, GROSS!! Maybe they got offended cause I asked if they had fresh greens. I mean who wants their salad old,brown and yellow. Never again I will stick with my usual spot where they have friendly employees who love their job!!! -100 on their salad and customer service!"}
{"text":"Awesome!   Fresh, fast, and friendly. Great tasting crust. Flavorful ingredients including Mamas Sweet Hot Peppers!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I love fired pie until I came to Mod. My new favorite. Fresh ingredients, great pizza, outstanding staff and a patio! Ok, so 8 months a year it is a plus. Great concept, great family environment. How could I forget the $5 happy hour pitchers until 6:00 pm."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a new pizza place open near home. I wanted to like it. Seriously, I wanted to like it. It's a new chain. Feels like a Moe's serving pizza. You know, the \"hello\" as EVERYBODY walks in the front door. Place is new and there are a few kinks to still work out. Understandable. I am sure they will get there. Service was pretty good. You walk-in, order and then pay. They write your name on the paper that goes under the pizza. Lots of toppings to choose from. I ordered a Caesar salad and Dillion James. Salad was ready in minutes. Pizza was ready in about 5-6 minutes. Salad was good.  The pizza-eh, it was not good at all. The crust is formed out of a dough ball that is pressed flat by a machine, topped and then put in the oven. The dough was overly chewy, cheese just melted but not cooked long enough for my liking.  The dining environment-nice but seriously felt as if I was sitting in an employee break room. Manager or owner sitting in the left corner on laptop, crew on break eating and sitting, working staff constantly coming over to chat with those in the corner. Oh, and those folks yelling \"hello\" was even more annoying. Just didn't make for a nice dining space.  This place is probably nice for a family of four with young kids.  Would I go back, no. Would I recommend, no. There are other similarly branded concepts that are legit and better. Maybe the pizza I had was just off, but the environment was less than desirable."}
{"text":"I really love the concept and ended up with a good product. Only one less star because half the emplyees have very low energy and are somehow unable to keep their assigned condiments well stocked. Why would you put thus employees at the front of the line?!?! It just seems like insanity to me but whatever. For now, it hasn't become such a big problem to stop me from going."}
{"text":"I can't complain. MOD is a good affordable quick filler for lazy nights when you don't have the energy to make your own food. I haven't had a bad experience with the staff in 5 times of coming to MOD. The dude that helped me this time was Anthony. He was super friendly and as usual suggested good toppings that I can't seem to make a decision on. We'll be back again for sure."}
{"text":"I loved that you can put choose from one of the classics on the menu or make it the way you want.  I also enjoyed the ceasar salad.  I added red onion on the ceasar, which made it that much better."}
{"text":"Pay one price, depending on size, and decide what toppings you want. The combination is unlimited. Their lemonade is equally awesome! The food tastes great and priced reasonable. I have a great time trying new topping creations. This is a busy place and for a good reason. Seating can be a challenge and due to the busy factor can have you waiting for a seat at times. Regadrless, I highly recommend this as a must visit."}
{"text":"This is my first try at MOD Pizza. Stands way ahead in game with Pizza Hut/Dominos.  Ordered -  Dillon James Pizza (thick crust): tasted very delicious and very filling. Had a pesto drizzle on the pizza and it was heaven. Definitely would come back for their pizzas.  Ambience is good. Needs little attention to hygiene though."}
{"text":"We arrived almost at closing time and the staff was still happy to see us, even though they were  almost closed. The staff did not rush us and took the time to make a great product."}
{"text":"MOD is one of my favorite places for a quick bite. Everything is made the way you want and the wait time is next to nothing. The employees are super nice and friendly. Amazing prices and is nice just to go and eat and have fun!"}
{"text":"The food was great but the customer service was awful. Alyssa was incredibly rude and put hardly any food on the pizza. We had to ask for more cheese four times. She also made a salty comment about us asking for more. She wasn't personable at all."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Love the build your own! I love all the veggie options i can pile on my Pizza, grilled broccoli-asparagus tips-greek olives- grilled garlic cloves, etc.....the different sauces and cheeses you can choosev are just great, thin crust really makes it, always consistent. The staff is really welcoming and nice. My once a week go to place."}
{"text":"Not sure why the company even comments back on reviews saying mgmt will get in touch...they don't really care. Better pizza places to visit."}
{"text":"I've gone to MOD Pizza several times, and each visit was increasingly better than the last! Along with friendly employees that guide you on your magical journey of pizza bliss, MOD has a wide variety of veggies, fruits, and more that are cooked to perfection in a big wood fire stove. (Plus, their signature lemonade is too hard to resist.)  I encourage any pizza-lover, or any person that eats food to eat at MOD Pizza!"}
{"text":"Food was very good we will be going back.  I like that everyone can get the pizza they want and feel the prices are fair."}
{"text":"MOD pizza never disappoints. The staff is always friendly, helpful, and courteous. The pizza is always cooked to perfection, and their salads are delicious. We love their Gluten free pizza stacked with toppings. Thanks MOD!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday evening about 6:15. The place has a nice vibe, the employees are friendly, and the prices are wonderful.  I ordered The Jasper and one of the strawberry desserts. The ingredients tasted fresh and everything had a good flavor.  I'm giving the place two stars because the crust was terrible. It was extremely \"chewy.\" It was like putting a tortilla in the microwave for 5 minutes. The crusty just ruined it for me. I always like thin crust pizza...but they usually are a bit crispy. This one tasted cheap (which it was!).  I am glad I tried the place, but I have no desire to go back...and won't."}
{"text":"Great pizza and a reasonable price. They are also a part of the Tempe marketplace lunch deal where if you have the card it's BOGO pizza or salad. Must have the card for this deal. \"The Phoenix\" seasonal is amazing. Sausage, red peppers, mushrooms, arugula, asiago and balsamic glaze"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for something new and MOD was across the street from the hotel I was staying at. The food was delicious, and the staff were the nicest, friendliest people I 've ever met, anywhere."}
{"text":"Coke when they have it. I love mod pizza but this one is poorly managed (I say that as someone who managed pizza parlors for years). Slower service than other mod pizzas I have been too - Diet Coke out of order. Pineapple? \" what's in there is all there is\" 4 little pieces. Sure you have a dinner rush but you know what a typical night is but do your food prep (open the can?) and have it under the counter. Felt like the dude just didn't want to take the time. Mod Pizza has a solid product and delivery system that normally runs like a top - that means the manager isn't paying attention to detail and holding his employees accountable for specific timely performance... just saying... sorry guys."}
{"text":"I used to manage pizza parlours so I am picky...  It's worthy! Might upgrade this to 5 stars next time I come. Thinner and healthier than what we used to make.  But that is a good thing I guess.  This place is definitely worth trying,"}
{"text":"My first time here, the guy at the counter was friendly and explained my options and how to order. Very helpful for a newcomer. I got the Dillon James and added artichokes. It is nice how there is one price no matter what you get. Will be back to try more combinations!"}
{"text":"This place has great pizza. Full stop. We were eating within 10-15 minutes. Everybody in my family was happy with their food. I'll be back when I'm craving pizza again. My only wish would be if they added clams as a topping."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff, quick pizza, and fresh toppings. Back to the pizza... its just... ok. Not bad, not great. Had it been phenomenal pizza, it would've garnered 4 stars I'd recommend it, though, for someone looking for a decent, quick pizza."}
{"text":"This was our 1st time coming to this place and wanted to try their pizza.  My husband and I were very impressed with the pizza we ordered and it was delicious!!!! The inside seating area is small but they also have the outside area too.   Definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"Pizza was good. The restaurant was a disaster. Trash all over the floors, almost every table was dirty and/or had left dishes/trash. Went to the bathroom to wash my hands and it smelled like a sewer. I nearly threw up.   This used to be a nice place. WTF MOD?? Get your sh!t together.   Oh yeah, almost forgot. When did ranch swirl at the end become throw a plastic container of ranch on the plate?"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, friendly staff, and I like how reasonable the price is for a pizza. Will definitely be returning to this location."}
{"text":"So happy to have someplace new to eat. I work near and have been waiting for it to open. Concept is pretty great pick your topping and they fire it right there. Pizza was solid, thin with some brown crispy edges. I got a mini with pesto, mozzarella and asparagus. The mini is enough for a lunch and someone watching his figure. :-). I will be back and can't wait to try other combinations."}
{"text":"We came here and my dad's and husband's pizzas were free for Veteran's Day!  But that's not why I'm in love with this place. The pizza crust is light and not heavy at all. I love the unlimited toppings and there is so much to choose from. It's kind of like a Chipotle or Subway in the respect of how you build your food, only it's pizza.  The price is right too.  So thankful they built one here (within my 3 mile radius)!"}
{"text":"This pizza is delicious!!! Love the make it yourself style pizza places. Tried the gluten free crust with white sauce, chicken, mushrooms, and a variety of other toppings. The MOD size was enough to provide leftovers for the next day! The only negative thing was that the pizza didn't feel completely hot in the center...like it should have been baked a little longer. It still tasted great though. Friendly staff and busy atmosphere call for a good rating overall."}
{"text":"not all mods are created equal... but this one is extra special!  service: 5 food: 5  dessert: 5 drinks: 5 price: 5  (scale 1 to 5, 5 being best)"}
{"text":"Good variety of toppings. They have vegan cheese. Staff is friendly. Has outdoor seating and is clean inside."}
{"text":"Great food, great location, and amazing customer service! I've been multiple times always super enjoyable and welcoming. I would definitely recommend it and I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Good pizza with a fair price. They will make the pie just the way you ask them to. I add balsamic fig sauce on top. Good for lunch or dinner. I might have been to Mod Pizza over 20 times already. Really good value and yes they have beer."}
{"text":"Got 3 pizzas for under $23 all with tons of hand picked toppings...heck yes! Sausage, mushrooms, green pepper, red peppers, Asiago, basil Canadian bacon and more on the first. Pepperoni and olive with lots of cheese on the second. and my favorite, the white sauce with bacon chicken tomatoes and red onion!  The staff was super friendly and cooked one of the pizzas lightly as requested, all 3 pizzas were delicious. The staff was helpful and knew about the company's history which was refreshing. I'm stoked they're are close by because we will definitely be regulars!"}
{"text":"We love MOD Pizza! It is super neat to make your own pizza and they have some toppings that you normally wouldn't think of for pizza. I normally get red sauce, mozzarella, salami, blue cheese, red peppers, ham, and the balsamic fig swirl (this stuff is GREAT). So good!"}
{"text":"From my original review I have to a poor review because of the \"bitchy\" attitude I got from the woman getting my order wrong, not asking me if I want drizzle on my pizza and when choosing a drizzle I was given the rolled eye..look it's not hard to satisfy the customer but cut that bitch attitude if you're on your period please leave your shit attitude at the door and if you personally don't like your job find a better place maybe a different area of work. I asked for double balsamic fig drizzle and was given an eye roll, please hold your bitchiness for the next customer. Next time I will avoid MOD on a weekend, since the topping nazi wanted to hold all the drizzles hostage."}
{"text":"Went for a fast lunch with family. Pizza was ok but the workers behind the counter didn't seem to have it together at least the day we were there They have a good selection of different topping pizzas or you can pick the toppings you want. The salad looked good.  Looks like we are getting one in Denver. I would try it again"}
{"text":"It has always been so good!! I've always eaten in but today I got it to go. My pizza and garlic strips were black. I'll definitely go back just make sure you check if you get it too go. Mine was too black to eat :( otherwise the staff is awesome and its always been amazing when I get it for there"}
{"text":"Omg. This place is amazing. Great value and even better tasting. This will forever be my new pizza place. So happy we found this spot."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. Not as good as punch pizza in mn but similar style. Pretty fresh ingredients, but I might like to see more options- prosciutto, fresh arugala...."}
{"text":"Made to order artisan style pizzas. Great atmosphere and fun experience. New favorite pizza joint!"}
{"text":"I was here on 10/29/17 around 2pm and received the worst  treatment I've ever experienced. I'm vegan and was very excited to learn there were vegan options available such as vegan crust, Daiya cheese and vegan red sauce. Unfortunately my excitement was quickly replaced by frustration when we began ordering. The girl behind the counter acted as though I was speaking a different language when I asked for a small vegan crust. She told me they didn't have that and the only crust that was vegan was the one for the larger sizes. I told her she was mistaken and she continued to argue with me. Her equally rude co-worker finally turned to her and said \"i think they're all vegan\" then he grabbed a nutritional info booklet and slid it in my general direction and said \"if you're that worried about it then look it up\". I did and then gave it back to him. I tried to be polite and thank him, I told him it was useful and he just snapped at me \"yep that's what it's for\". The girl then asked me what kind of cheese and I told her I wanted the vegan Daiya, which she should have already gathered from my vegan crust request but whatever. Again she looked at me like I was crazy and said with a sigh *do you mean our dairy free cheese?\" Umm shouldn't you know the name of your own product? At this point I was really starting to get irritated. It was then that the guy behind the counter used the same gloves he had touched someone else's cheese with to put my friend's spinach on his pizza. My friend is also vegan.  This is a HUGE deal to vegans and if you're going to have vegan options you need to be prepared to handle the food correctly to insure there is no cross contamination. My friend asked the guy if he could start over and explained to him the issue with touching cheese and then touching his pizza. The guy just shrugged and said \"what toppings do you want?\" As if he didn't care at all about the concern my friend was having. My friend once again told him he wanted him to start over and yet again the guy shrugged and then began arguing that he never touched the cheese even though we both saw him do it. My friend finally told him to cancel the order. The guy working then had the nerve to yell over the counter \"hey man next time speak up if you want something\".  Well that was it for me and I went off on him. I don't think anyone would blame me.  First of all, the cross contamination and mishandling of a vegan order aside, you NEVER argue with a customer or tell them it's their fault or to speak up. I could not believe he had the attitude that he did, just shrugging his shoulders and being a huge a**hole. I will NEVER eat here again and will be spreading the word throughout my vegan community."}
{"text":"Where do I start?  Grand Opening. First visit. If you know Pie five then this is the same concept. $9 for a pie that can serve 2 if you're not big eaters with way more then enough for most. Great selection of toppings and you can get real creative. Cracker style crust. I was hoping for some kind G.O. specials or something. Just reg prices.  My humble opinion: it's ok. Better then it's competition. But $9 seems a bit much for what you get. It is convenient. But $10 @pizza hut gives you the same options but a much better pie. I don't care for the hut very much. I can't see going out to get one."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place more than I do. The food is good but I've been here two times and both times mine came out burnt and they had to redo (with trying to guess what was on my pizza without asking me what I had ordered). Doesn't make for a speedy or convenient experience which is what I think they're trying to do right?"}
{"text":"Nice place for pizza in Goodyear. Hubby and I shared a Mad Dog pizza and a salad made  to order. The ingredients were fresh and tasty. With drinks the tab came to $20.  The employees were friendly and the restaurant was as clean as a pin. We will come back again."}
{"text":"We have been back here 3 more times since our initial visit and we've yet to order and eat anything that wasn't great! Each pizza is different each time depending on the what flavor you are in the mood for. And no matter what toppings or how many, the price is always the same.  Wood fired, so it has that tasty, crispy, slightly burnt crust. It's ready in about 5 minutes...to go right in your belly."}
{"text":"Very good but just noticed we could have put more toppings at no additional costs.  Will make my own supreme pizza next time, lol."}
{"text":"MOD pizza is the best place to get the pizza just you the way you want! I love the Caspian pizza and the pear tea. The staff is the most friendly around. I went during their secret opening and everything turned out perfectly even with new staff. Kudos."}
{"text":"What can I say about MOD... Mod you are amazing! You make me happy on a budget  your staff is always on point with my order and always willing to walk it out for me when I'm sitting out side. Best beer on tab! Again I love you!"}
{"text":"I believe MOD is run by a group of racist lesbians. Both MOD pizzas I have been to one in arrowhead the other Chandler, I had identical experiences. I come in to get a pizza, and I have some white lesbian staring at me in disbelief,  that she is actually speaking to and looking at an African woman. It's creepy and weird. I feel aggression and a reluctance to serve me. It's like it is a painful experience for them. I just told myself this last time when I left, \"White people will be white people\". I find myself having to Hey that a lot recently. Pizza is very mediocre, lemonade is good."}
{"text":"One price. Unlimited topping options. Super awesome pizza makers. Quick. Tasty. What a fabulous idea!  Like the fancy subway version pizza joint.  I went a little crazy. Mixed red and white sauce, added ricotta, mozzarella, tomato, spicy sausage, roasted red pepper, artichoke hearts, feta, roasted garlic, and fresh basil and oregano. It was ridiculous.  Fluffy ice. Lemonade, fresh iced tea and even draft beer."}
{"text":"Went here today with a friend. Really DIG the concept and the food. Great price and with unlimited toppings and the master of your creation, you KNOW it's going to be awesome!! Very recommended and the workers were friendly & super cool!"}
{"text":"MOD Pizza just opened in Indian Trail & we LOVE it!! The pizzas are great! We have had several different pizzas there, the breadsticks, and the big salad. Everything was amazing and I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"We came here after my daughters concert. We have been here a few times. Normally we have great food and service this time was a little off. My daughter wanted extra olives and the girl seemed to get very annoyed at her. They say all the toppings you want and as much as you want. I think this employee didn't get the memo?? I am paying for the food why should I feel bad that my daughter wants more olives?? Dump all of them on there if she wants them. Sounds stupid but it ruined the mood and atmosphere for me this visit. The pizzas were delicious and we always go home with some for a mid night snack. To that employee- get a different job or change your attitude."}
{"text":"So fast, so delicious!  Think \"subway\" pizza style!!  Love building our own pizzas - everyone is happy, and prices are pretty good too!!"}
{"text":"Quick, fresh, and hot! There's no way to complain about too little toppings because you can always ask for more. Friendly employees and just a good vibe. At first I thought it was pricey but then realized that I get quite a bit of food for the money, usually I take half my pizza home. Best part, no 20 to 25% tip!"}
{"text":"Great concept.  Select all your ingredients as you watch your pizza made before your eyes.  Tastes good.  They also make teas, the last time I had an iced decaf that was delicious."}
{"text":"We love it here. The individual pizzas are perfect for one. I suggest getting your pizza well done so the crust is crispy. The ingredients are always fresh. Great pizza place, great service. Never a disappointment."}
{"text":"Pizza was amazing but the service sucked! 3 people behind us got there pizza first because they were friends and worked next door to mod pizza. If your friends with them you'll get ur pizza fast! If not then you might have to watch the people behind you get there food and leave while your still waiting. That's the last time I go there."}
{"text":"Just an update:  MOD continues to impress!  I just tried the Gluten Free crust.  It was delicious.  You better find time to fit MOD into your culinary schedule."}
{"text":"My first MOD experience= awesome, delicious and good service!!! The staff is friendly and help you choose your taste!!!"}
{"text":"First the pizza is five stars and the restaurant and the people there are five stars... the time it took to get our lunch last Friday was a -5 stars.  We got there around 11:40 and were the only people in line. We ordered and waited for 25 minutes for the pizza to be done and boxed. After we came in an influx of online and walk-in orders came, but the biggest problem seemed to be not enough staff. I know that someone might've called off, but one of my co-workers got their pizza 10 minutes before my pizza and another co-workers pizza was boxed.   So, her pizza was cold and we were late for lunch. I have ordered online and just a walk-in order and never had this problem. It seemed like they didn't have enough to-go boxes made and nobody could keep up. Also, there was a big back-up of pizzas on the counter, which had a big sauce splatter on it. Not the cleanest looking place to put a pizza.   I even had to move the napkin dispenser so the guy working the oven could place a pizza.  This place is amazing, but I hope they don't try to skimp by not having enough staff. This experience has me questioning whether to go back. I was 6th in line on opening day too and love what they do. Sad day on Friday."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, awesome team and FANTASTIC pizza!  I can't understand for the life of me why the Chick-Fill-A is always more crowded.  Who would want greasy hormone chicken when you can have your own pie ready to go in a shorter time and with awesome fresh ingredients?!  I'm one loyal customer!"}
{"text":"This seems to be a new trend in pizza restaurants. It works like a Subway restaurant where you tell them what you want on your pizza as you watch them add each ingredient, similar to how Subway makes sandwiches. But at the end, you pay and your pizza goes into an oven. There are three competing restaurants within a couple of miles of each other that are offering this style of pizza. At Westgate, there is Fired Pie. At 99th Ave and McDowell, there is Pieology and, at Litchfield Rd and I-10, there is MOD (short for Made On Demand. And, coincidentally, next door to MOD is a Subway sandwich shop.) Pieology was started by one of MODs original founders. There are also a few more restaurants using this same concept, though not located here. They are called Blaze Fast-Fired Pizza, PizzaRev, Pie Five, Pizza Studio, Your Pie, Project Pie, and Uncle Maddio's.  Having already been to Fired Pie, I had an idea of what to expect. MOD has the 800 degree stone ovens, so a pizza only takes about 3 minutes to cook.  While I enjoyed Fired Pie at first, I couldn't get the taste out of my mouth for two days afterwards, so I haven't been back since, but decided to try MOD to see how it compared.  The staff are all very friendly and the prices are mostly reasonable. Drinks only come in one size, which is fairly small. Think of a typical red Solo plastic cup. That's pretty much it. They offer Coke products (serve yourself) and have lemonade and tea as well. If you order a beer, its served in the same, small plastic cup, and at $4.97, its a bit over-priced.  But I didn't come here for a beer or milkshakes. Oh yeah, did I mention they have milkshakes? Well, there you go.  The pizza crust they use is similar in size and texture as a flour tortilla (burrito size - 10\") but, unlike a standard flour tortilla, it does have a raised crust on the edge. I had them make me a pizza with pepperoni, mushroom, basil, red sauce and mozzarella cheese. It was okay. Not great, not terrible. I do wish these places would stop with the generic toppings and start offering a little more creativity. For example, I would like to see a 'tangy' or spicy red sauce offering. I'd like to see smoked mozzarella, and where is the provolone? For the most part, all of the toppings are the same you'd find on practically any pizza menu, but here you can witness them making your pizza and can ask them to add more or less of each item to your personal preference.  The pizza (regardless of toppings) is $7.47. A drink is $1.97 and a 'mini' salad is $4.47 (and its a fairly large salad to be called mini.)  I'm glad to say that I do not have the lingering after-taste in my mouth that I experienced at Fired Pie. Still, the pizza offered me nothing truly unique or different from any other pizza place other than how its made. That's not enough reason to eat there. I still prefer Grimaldi's for the best pizza in town. But I can see how places like MOD, Pieology and Fired Pie COULD potentially steal the show. It's clever to give the customer more control over how their pizza is being made, but it could be a runaway hit if they gave customers more options for sauces, cheeses and toppings than an every other pizza place."}
{"text":"Great pizza but loud and intolerably slow. It took me twenty minutes just to order. The pizza is different and good but having to wait so long in line is unacceptable."}
{"text":"They have great quick custom pizza! I enjoyed the build your own! They serve a thin crust with lots of choices for toppings and sauce! The staff was very pleasant! Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for a coupon, so after we got one in the mail for a free MOD pizza, the fella and I ventured in on a Friday evening. It definitely has a Chipotle/Chopt feel in that you queue up and order at the counter - either a set pizza (they have 9) or a build your own as you walk down the counter and tell different staff what toppings you want. I opted to make a Hawaiian pizza, and the fella went for the Mad Dog (their version of a meatza) with a few extra toppings since toppings are free.  The fella got a canned beer (they also have a few drafts), and we grabbed a seat to wait for our name to be called. The place itself is pretty stark with concrete floors and aluminum seats/tables, but the massive photo mural on the wall made it feel more cozy.  I missed hearing our name, so our pizza sat on the counter a few extra minutes, but it was still pretty tasty. The crust is thin, and I'm more of a thick crust person, but it was still good. The sauce was on the sweeter side, which I like, and they weren't stingy with the toppings.  Our bill was cheaper than usual because of the coupon, but a four-slice, MOD size pizza is only $7.77, which I think is a good deal. They also have a mini option and a mega option.  I also love that the staff yells \"Hello!\" to every person who walks in. Definite \"Welcome to Moe's\" vibe, but they kept it fun and fresh every time they yelled it."}
{"text":"Fast casual pizza and salads at its best. I've never had a bad experience at Mod Pizza. Service is always great and staff actually look happy to be there.  One thing I love is customization. When you first order, you can choose one of the pizzas from the wall or start there and add more toppings or you can just say everything you want. Same goes for the salads. All the toppings are fresh and there's a large variety. And you can get as many toppings as you want even proteins at no extra cost. Pizzas go into  brick oven. And the salads are tossed in a huge bowl in front of you.   I'm trying to make better decisions and honestly I love the salads at Mod. Having to choose between pizza and salad is actually hard here. I went with a salad. I got mixed greens, grilled chicken, salami, sliced tomatoes, Greek olives, sweet and spicy peppers, roasted broccoli, parmesan and croutons tossed in Italian dressing. It was light, but full of flavor. The lil' sweet and spicy peppers are my favorite.   Definitely love coming here for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"When I'm craving pizza this is one of my go to spots! I love that you can build your own pizza and you can put any topping you want without paying extra :) they also have pre made pizza selections if you don't know what to get. You can choose from 3 different pizza sizes ( I usually get a mod which is equivalent to a mini medium pizza) The staff is always friendly and the service is fast!"}
{"text":"2nd time here, ordered salads to go online. The salads were completely wrong. Basically I blame the system. On the print outs it only says \"Caesar\"  + corn, garlic, onions -tomatoes. But they only gave me what I wanted to add which was lettuce and the above (nothing that normally comes w/ Caesar). So if I wanted that I would have just built my own. Same thing happened to the deluxe salad we ordered... such a mess. Luckily Alan was super accommodating and polite (only reason I rated this 3 v 2 stars). Cant say that about everyone there- both my bf and I were greeted with a lot of attitude by a woman working the register, super uncomfortable. Just a heads up if order similar things online, may be worth double checking before you leave, in addition to the staff being hit or miss."}
{"text":"What great pizza. One of the best I've had love the items they offer to put on it.  Very clean and upbeat place.  Don't miss trying out this one"}
{"text":"Great pizza place that is one of the many \"make your own pizza\" franchises fighting for a foothold lately.  I hope MOD is one of the chains that is successful, they have decent pizza and good locations.  Just do yourself a favor and order online before you go if you are going during the dinner/weekend rush.  The one major downsides to all these new pizza places are tons of people new to the process who don't know what they want and ask a million questions and make the line moves SO SLOWLY.  They should really have a \"I need a little hand-holding\" line and a \"get out of my way I know what I want\" line."}
{"text":"I am usually not a fan of chains but I love this place. The salads and the pizzas are both excellent. Once you pick a size, the price is fixed! Unlimited ingredients! And the quality of the ingredients is excellent.  Bonus: they have both beer and wine on tap!"}
{"text":"Cool place.  Pizza is really good i chose some nice thin crust cause that is whst I like. Good for kids as well."}
{"text":"The pizza is tasty but the services was horrible. The employees was being so rude. Honestly I would rather go to Fired Pie, where people greet you with a smile. This was such a bad experience, definitely won't be a second time. If I could give this place no stars, I would. Please save yourself sometime and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"My two children and I visited MOD pizza for the first time on a Wednesday evening. I really liked the concept, the variety of toppings, and the specialty pies they offered. But... The toppings bar was a mess. There was a lot of cross contamination of toppings falling into different containers and two of our three pizzas had random pieces of toppings on them. I would think this could be an issue if people have food allergies or do not eat meat, etc. They were also quite busy and it seemed like they could have used a few extra staff behind the counter. After we ordered our food we had to stand around a wait a while for someone to accept my payment."}
{"text":"What a fun, new addition to Fitchburg! Delicious, handcrafted pizzas with fresh ingredients! The salads are also delicious! We can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here every Sunday for a few weeks now and we've been very happy with every visit. The food is fantastic and the service is top shelf. Jacinda has helped us just about every time we have come in and we have nothing but good things to say about her and the rest of the staff. There is something good for everyone in our family to choose from and with my big family that's saying a lot. We will continue to eat here often. Thank you Mod."}
{"text":"Great fresh food with lots of choices. The staff is fantastic and the place is always clean......"}
{"text":"Best pizza. Best staff. The manager really made my sisters birthday party fun.  I would suggest the bbq pizza. Delish"}
{"text":"Avacado is extra Food sickness is always free , than we will tell you sorry , we will refund you your 25$ purchase and than GHOST you. Massively unprofessional , vile ethic and terrible buisness practice , will not recommend and will verbally burn MOD pizza at any chance ,"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. I can make pita bread with toppings myself at home. I have expected way more. Especially for the price that you pay. Please don't call yourself pizza place - you are no better than subway pizza."}
{"text":"Our first time here. I heard it from a few of my clients. The setting wasn't bad except it was extremely cold in there that it was hard for me to eat the pizza and got cool before we made it to the table.   As for the service, they were great. We told them it was our first time so they were really helpful to us. Very polite & courteous as well.   Now for the pizza itself. You have 3 sizes to choose from, Mini, Mod or Mega. I got the mod and hubby got the mega (mod over cheese pizza). So it's pretty interesting because it's a buffet of toppings that you choose from to \"modify\" your pizza with. They also have classics you can choose from if you don't want to create your own. The great thing is, the toppings are unlimited. The pizzas are Artisan style so it goes into a wood burning like fire grill.   Overall the taste was not bad at all. The service was great. The restaurant is very clean. Oh and they have homemade lemonades and teas. Only 2 of each to choose from but pretty good."}
{"text":"Pizza was good, fast  service. We a little hot, spicy sauce on my pizza even though it was there tomato sauce.  Busy, had to wait for a table."}
{"text":"The service was fine. Nothing spectacular. The pizza was average, pretty good, but the crust was hard like a tortilla chip. I liked the drinks and there were quite a few options but I didn't see the amazing MOD everyone was talking about."}
{"text":"So here's what's up: for a gluten free pizza, the price and size were fantastic! Typically places charge for every little topping and a ten inch gluten free pizza will end up costing close to $30. At MOD it costs in the neighborhood of $10 and you get leftovers with the size of the pizza. YUM!!!   My one recommendation, which is why I gave it a 4 star, is that the workers should be required to wear hats or hairnets. I was very bothered and afraid I'd find a hair in my food because. Please consider this as part of the uniform.    Thank you for delicious food!"}
{"text":"My favorite of the create-your-own-pie concept restaurants to pop up in recent times. Not only do I think Mod's topping selection is slightly better than it's competitors such as Fired Pie and Pizza Studio, so is the service. For whatever reason, the employees seem happier to be there and you don't get the feeling you're being bothersome the more toppings you request. The finished pizza is also noticeably better, closer in quality to notoriously delicious neopolitan pizza restaurants such as Pomo and Cibo. On top of all of this, the company shows it's love for military and veterans with every visit, offering discounts to those who served. And lastly, their caramelized pear tea is fantastic. I've decided I'll be a regular here."}
{"text":"I enjoy every MOD I've been to. This new-er one in Tempe Marketplace is no exception. Good pizza, very reasonable prices, and like most MODS, very courteous staff. The man who appeared to be the manager on duty had a very noticeably friendly and outgoing personality. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Friendly service: the guys who build your pie are very talkative & seem to love what they do.  Good food: Consistentancy in taste throughout the various MODs I've eaten at. Some offer a few different ingredients you can add to your pie. Always delish artisan style pizzas.  Reasonable prices: No matter how many toppings you add to your pizza, the price will not change. You can expect to pay within the $8-$9 range after tax.   Cool atmosphere: Always a hip/modern interior, very clean and with just the right lighting.  Military discounts: Another reason I always choose MOD over Fired Pie is that they offer this to military and vets; a smart & generous move.  My experience at this north Scottsdale location was as pleasant as it's been in their other locations. Thumbs up MOD."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere.  It's always clean.  The staff is friendly.  The toppings are decent.  But the crust is not my favorite.  However I'd highly recommend the balsamic fig glaze.  This is a decent place for a quick lunch and it's always good, but it isn't life changing."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried MOD Pizza for the first time today and we have put this place on our \"Weekly Eat Out List\". We shared the Mad Dog pizza and it was perfection. The thin crust is awesome, tasted excellent and was ready within a couple of minutes. YOU MUST TRY THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix, from Anaheim CA, with spouse, to see mother in a care facility that was less than a block from this establishment.  It was the first time that I have ever seen a build-your-own pizza place.  This unit used to house a Papa Murphy's bake your own, and we went inside to see what it was now. It was about 9:53 pm when we entered. First question: when do you close?  Answer: in six minutes.   They explained the concept, and we opted for all vegetable items. Could only be more healthy if they had a whole wheat crust option. Employees did not rush us, even at closing time.  We were pleased with the variety of options, and would return to this establishment on our next visit."}
{"text":"Great Pizza! Great service! The staff at MOD's are friendly and accommodating. And the food is really good. Great addition to the Rivergate community."}
{"text":"Went here for the 1st time and was impressed with the setup and the flow of the restaurant.  The food was fresh and the flavor of the pizza was really good. I was surprised that they stop at an 11 inch crust and not go to the 12 inch size that most places use. This will definitely be a regular stop of mine."}
{"text":"A coworker of mine said I had to try MOD pizza after she found out I had never been, so we went for lunch today. I am very glad she motivated me to give this place a try. The 11'' pizza was the perfect size, tasted amazing, and the service was beyond what I am accustomed to from a quick place to grab lunch. I will definitely be returning. Shout out to the GM (Mike, I think), who made sure our experience was 5 star worthy."}
{"text":"MOD is good... Would not do the double as its just more dough.  Toppings were all pretty good and they have beer on tap which is cool.  Prices were really good and its definitely kid friendly."}
{"text":"Good pizza for the price (7.50). I find it funny that people bash the pizza for being an ordinary pie. What is one expecting for $7.50? The process is quick, affordable, decent taste, and the staff is friendly. For what your paying for, I would have given the place a five star rating if they had not forgotten to cut my pizza. How you forget that :) Either way, a good lunch stop and/or place to give your kids freedom to pick their own food out."}
{"text":"I'm actually amazed at how disappointed I was when eating here. I heard such great things but the pizza was lackluster. There wasn't really much flavor to the sauce and the meat could have been better. Maybe they just had an off day but I was disappointed."}
{"text":"O bom deste lugar é que você pode montar sua própria pizza, e eles têm muita opções boas. Eu amei!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent pizza especially when you're in a hurry. One thing is for sure, they cook and serve your pizza very fast without compromising the crispyness of the crust."}
{"text":"I went in assuming it was going to be like Fired Pie. It was, except lesser quality in pretty much every way. My biggest gripe is that the crust is already fully cooked, so when the cook the pizza as a whole the crust will be overlooked and way too hard, as opposed to Fired Pie where they put your toppings on dough and not pre-made crust. I also asked if they could put a thin layer of butter on the crust topped with marinara to make a butter crust pizza(butter crust pizza is very good) but they said no. I didn't fully understand their reasoning because butter was one of their options, but regardless, I was very underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Wow. What a difference a month makes. AWFUL experience,  unprofessional kids running the place, mixed my order up and when my new pizza came out it was burned. Didn't want to waste even more time having a new pizza made, but most of mine ended up in the garbage. Don't waste your time, stick with Wendy's or Carl's Jr"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy!! I tried this place based on the excellent reviews and I can say the pizza is great! Super fresh ingredients and the perfect sizes too. I got a mod I think and a mini and even though they may look small they are honestly filling. $8 for a pizza that good is a place I will be visiting a lot more from now on. Unlimited toppings all included?? Where have they been in the months I was looking for great pizza. The crust was great too flaky and fresh and just great! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"When wanting to have pizza Mod Pizza is where to go in Gilbert Arizona! True Italian! Like nothing I've tasted. Cheese it to die for!"}
{"text":"HAIR IN MY FOOD  The first couple times I went here, my experience was awesome! Everyone was really nice, and helpful with suggestions for pizza toppings. This last time, not so much. The first thing that happened was when I asked for  a specific kind of cheese, but they added blue cheese (Gorgonzola) instead. I normally would just let it go since I figured that they'd start over after covering my pizza in it, but they just picked off the big pieces and proceeded to ask me for the rest of my toppings. Again, not a big deal, but then when I got my pizza, a good 1cm of the crust was burnt black. I also didn't mention anything about this, I figured there were some new people and I was trying to be kind, as I also work in customer service and understand it can be stressful. The last straw, however, was when I got home. There was a piece of hair STUCK in my CRUST. And when I say STUCK, I mean I literally tried to pull it out and it was stuck too deep inside to just pull out. You can even see it in this picture. I don't think I'll be returning to this location :("}
{"text":"Cool place with very fast service and an incredibly friendly staff. We loved the pizza and will be making this a usual family dining spot!"}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza and outstanding service!  Reasonably priced and great quality.  My husband and I loved the specialty BBQ pizza with Gorgonzola cheese it was one of the better pizzas we've ever had.  My two year old devoured the Oreo milkshake.  Caesar salad was also very good.  Server Lou was outstanding!  She was very friendly, knowledgeable and had great suggestions.  We will definitely be coming back on a regular basis and suggesting this restaurant to friends, much better than some of the other build your own pizza places we've been to.  Also very kid friendly. Definitely 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I always get amazing service here. The employees are quick, friendly, and REALLY good at helping customers customize their orders. This is one of my all-time favorite places to grab pizza."}
{"text":"Well I am just tickled that MOD pizza is right in my neighborhood. I went last night for the first time and was very impressed. My choice of toppings for my pizza were excellent but I have to say the roasted broccoli was like eating a good piece chocolate yum o. The people who work there are friendly and helpful.  I actually look forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"The beginning crew member did not roll the crust with the spike like she was supposed to. I watched her miss this step repeatedly. We were the only ones in line and when we finished there was a longer line behind us.   The crew in the front line were not in any hurry and they had no hustle at all. They have plenty of staff juts not interested in helping the front line.  Ordered shakes and they were slow to come out. My husband's pizza came out first and mine was slow to come. Came to get the shakes and my pizza was just sitting.   All in all from our first few visits here till this visit somethings has changed. Manager was here but not helping her team and seemed busy with other things. They don't yell out hello and goodbye anymore. 7 crew members working but yet they seem very slow and unorganized."}
{"text":"Great place and moves very fast even when they have a long line. I love the fact you can make your own pizza and put the toppings on that you want. This is pizza meets fast food at its best.  They have a great outside eating area that had a fire pit in it. Very great place for atmosphere"}
{"text":"I found this place as I searched Yelp for a restaurant in the area. I read the reviews and gave it a go with my Sister In-law. This location has been many restaurants in the 12 years I've lived in Goodyear and I can honestly say I hope this place is the place that STAYS!!   MOD (Made on Demand) is an excellent concept and I've heard there are some others out there that are similar but when I walked in the staff was super friendly and welcoming. I wasn't sure how to order so they walked me through it all. I loved that I could actually get a pizza with every ingredient they had and it would still be the same price! I got the MOD size and my Sis in-law got a Mini size. We both LOVED that they had good sized mushrooms and not tiny little slivers! I got tons of garlic because my motto is you can never have too much! The toppings were so fresh and delicious!   The homemade and fresh lemonade they make (in 4 flavors) was not only amazing but it was the same price as all drinks $1.97 with FREE refills! Most places charge more than $3 for fresh lemonade with no refills!   We learned that MOD started as a company during our 2008 Recession and their slogan is \"Simple Food for Complex Times\" and that in itself impressed me. Totally affordable and I will be back!!!   Thanks for a great dinner MOD...can't wait to have my leftovers for lunch today!"}
{"text":"I love having the gluten free and dairy free options. Great pizza and really friendly staff."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza!  Always helpful and friendly staff.  I've been there plenty of times.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was my first time into MOD- went in at the lunch rush. There were about 10 people in front of me in line but the line moved quickly. I really liked how friendly the employees were and how they explained everything. It's awesome you can add whatever toppings you want for the same price. I went with the Dillion James pizza but added chicken, mushrooms and green peppers. The menu is really inclusive with lots of options, even gluten free crust and dairy free cheese. For the pizza and drink, I paid a little over $10. I tried a sample of the blackberry lemonade and it was a little too sweet for me but I saw a lot of people drinking it. From waiting in line to ordering to receiving my pizza, I waited 15 min. Not bad at all! Pizza was a good size with 4 slices and tasted really good! I didn't finish everything but they conveniently have to go boxes by the drink station to take your leftovers home. Tables were being cleaned when I was there so it was very clean.   I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is my first time trying out the Mod Pizza Chain.  I was pretty impressed.  The model is - one price for an 11\" pizza with unlimited toppings.  I like the smaller size because it appeals to sharing but also personalized options.  The toppings were fresh.  Little things I would change....chop the onions.    The I had the deluxe salad, it was ok.  This was a pre-designed salad.  I do not think that $7.87 for a salad is worth it as compared to the pizza.    They also have shakes, bevvies, beer.  Overall this place is open, airy, good food.  One stop shop for dinner or a quick mall stop."}
{"text":"I've just been here once but it was pretty good!  I really like that you can \"make your own\" and add as many toppings as you want for a flat price.  I had the Dillon James and added mushrooms and roasted garlic - it was delicious.  I would definitely eat here again. also got a salad and it was really good too for the price!  Service was fast and polite."}
{"text":"I am a new MOD fan. The ingredients are fresh and the customer service is friendly and welcoming. I always build my own pizza and then add spinach and pesto after it comes out of the oven. Delicious and great for take-out. The dining space is clean and comfortable. I highly recommend MOD if you enjoy affordable and personalized pizzas. I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I wasn't too thrilled about another pizza place opening up in our area but I'm glad we checked it out because its not your typical pie joint.  You can customize your pizza with whatever base sauce, meats, veggies, spices, garnishes, cheeses and seasonings.  As fresh as it gets!  Plus I love the light thin crust that doesn't give you that \"fat pants\" type of feeling. Prices are reasonable too!  This Italian Momma gives two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This pizza place is amazing! There are so many options. The people who work here are so helpful and nice. You can add anything extra to a pizza and it won't cost extra. The 11' pizza is the perfect size for one person as well as affordable. The pizza is amazing!"}
{"text":"First time here. Very impressed. I see what all the hype is about. Will be back more often. Unlimited toppings. Pizza fresh and made when ordered. 100% custom."}
{"text":"Chipotle style pizza joint works. Pizza came out faster than we thought. You can add as many toppings as you like. Great price. Gradients are fresh. Not a bad concept."}
{"text":"The have a gluten-free crust.  It's not celiac-safe since it's cooked in the same oven as the other dough, but if you avoid gluten for other reasons then add MOD to the list of places you can eat.  It's a perfect sized individual pizza, a large amount of glorious toppings to choose from, comes out fast and their beverage selection ain't too shabby either (blood orange San Pellegrino - YUM!)"}
{"text":"Quick and tasty! Very friendly staff as well! This girl with dark hair and a banana is awesome! I always see her when I come in and she's got the greatest personality and customer service!   I sat there and people watched while I ate one day, and they legitimately have regulars that they know by name and genuinely ask how they're doing, remembering details. And let me mention again... pizzas are out quickly, fired just right, and ingredients so fresh. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great food for one price. Friendly staff. Darrin is our favorite pizza artist! This is our second visit in 2 days and it won't be the last!!"}
{"text":"Great value! This is one of those places that's like a subway or Chipotle, but for pizza. You can add as many toppings as you'd like.  We got a Tristan mod: pesto, mushrooms, cheese, red peppers, and we added chicken, spinach, and artichoke. It was so good and filling! Two people can share the mod size $8. We also got garlic dipping sticks: a 6 inch thin crust pizza crust with garlic and two dipping sauces $3. Super friendly staff. Manager actually cares about you as a customer. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"So my experiences with Mod have all been amazing fully customizable pizza fast! It doesn't get better than that! Jk it does the people who work at mod are friendly, helpful, and just brighten up your day. I love coming to this location by far my favorite! Marion blackberry lemonade is unbelievable, I'm a lemonade person and this location does it right! One day I hope to have my own pizza on the wall, wait on it! The Kimbo pizza will be up there one day :)"}
{"text":"We love it here!  Something for everyone!  I like to get a mini pizza and small salad, perfect meal. I love all the toppings you can get and the honey lime dressing is so good!"}
{"text":"I visited Mod one night when I couldn't decide what to eat. The staff friendly and patient. Yes I'm the lady that asked you to cut my pizza into squares. The menu and fresh ingredients super fantastic. If you visit me in Arizona ask me to take you there Hawaiian this place gets 4 shakas and 4 pats of the opu. Yum. Kanak attack."}
{"text":"Very good pizza and the garlic strips with pesto sauce might be even better. The staff is well trained and ridiculously nice and combined with the good food makes for a really nice, yet quick meal."}
{"text":"What I love about MOD Pizza: One can make their own custom pizza! And, they donate a percentage of their proceeds to charity. After having a previous unpleasant experience at another MOD Pizza, I decided to give this one a try. The employees were very nice and helpful. The pizza was made to perfection. Very happy with my experience!"}
{"text":"Ownership cares what customers thinks, much respect. Believe they fixed the hours on Yelp as well.   Here now, and they are super fast and FRIENDLY.   Love this place. Greet you when you walk in, even when theirs 20 people in line.   Pizzas are spot on each time.   Best part, AFFORDABLE! we each get our own PERSONAL pizzas and drinks for $13!! Can't beat that."}
{"text":"As good as it gets for fast gluten-free pizza. Excellent and fun customer service. Stephen is legit and makes a great pizza! I eat here 2-3 times per week. Don't know what the heck I would do without Mod Pizza! I'd starve, or have to settle for some bad and overpriced gluten free pizza somewhere else.  Thanks Mod!"}
{"text":"Staff is stupid when you ask about their pizzas. Pizza was not made like I ordered and when I asked the staff had an attitude about it. I will NEVER be back to this place again. The staff need to learn how to run a business or shut the doors, that simple!"}
{"text":"I first saw the concept for this type of pizza place in San Diego called project pie. Mod pizza is pretty close but if they really worked hard and used really high quality ingredients and better soda selection, they'd be 5 stars just like project pie (see my review from earlier this year). Still, mod pizza is pretty good, and I'll probably be a regular."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place! The employees are very helpful and are always willing to help with questions and most of all give me as many toppings as I want!! Love the fresh topping and love their pizza. The prize is a the best deal you can get for how much you eat! I love this place and hope they build one in queen creek!"}
{"text":"first time we decided to try this place, we drove up around 6pm.. didn't see a single customer inside the place so we decided to move on and go elsewhere. almost did the same thing again tonight but decided to go inside anyhow. very glad we did! this place makes a damn good pizza and salad. PBR in bottles too! this is a great little place and we will definitely come back. thank you!   **btw, the dining room is off to the right of the main entrance so it looks very empty.. its not!"}
{"text":"Pizza was really good.  Tiny and thin crust, but packed a lot of flavor!  My only complaint was the online ordering.  It was not as smooth as it could have been and we received a call from the restaurant since our order didn't show correctly on their side.  Also, the online order says that your pizza will be ready in 45 minutes and we showed up early and it was already done and waiting for us.  Seems like the online aspect needs a little fine tuning, but I am sure that has nothing to do with the location, but the company overall!  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"My fav pizza place in the usa. Always been so disappointed with other known places. With pizza taste and the ridiculous extra charge per ingredient..and when I would rarely find a good pizza place it be about $17 per pizza. So, brings me to mod pizza. Love the concept, the taste, the choice of ingredients and the price is fair.  I have been going to this location since I moved to gilbert and always happy with the customer service as well."}
{"text":"We really like this pizza! We got the biggest size and they double crust it, you can get any toppings you want at no extra charge! They bake it in a brick oven and the crust comes out crusty and delicious!! I share with my 2 & 4 year olds and my niece, we each got one piece."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant!!! The food is amazing and the staff is so friendly!  Great place to go if your family has a hard time agreeing on what kind of pizza you should order.  Everyone can choose their pizza with their favorite toppings.  Definitely worth trying if you haven't been there!!!"}
{"text":"Staff is so friendly and helpful on my first visit here ! Pizza was amazing, I absolutely love the idea of this place. They made it exactly how I wanted it. They also have a yummy lemonade that has a great flavor; not too sweet, nor bitter. Defense one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a fast pizza to go, late, our last night in Phoenix. The crust is thin the pizza is built right in front of you. They charge one price per size and you can add whatever toppings you want for that price. There's inside or outside seating. This is not authentic New York style pizza. But as a late night snack it hit the spot. The staff on duty that night were terrific."}
{"text":"Just tied this place for the first time. I have seen it on my way to Costco several times. Well, it is fantastic. It's like subway for pizza. Pick your size, and pick you toppings. Nothing to pay extra on for more toppings. Very friendly staff and warm inviting culture. Make plans to stop by this place next time you in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the gluten-free crust. Employees did not change their gloves when completing my order even after telling them I had a food allergy. It took the employee five different gluten-free pizzas to find one in the box that wasn't completely destroyed to make my order. Used to be my favorite place to eat until I develop this food allergy and probably will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is open and friendly. They use frozen pizza dough and yell your name once the pizza is done which is about 5 minutes. Besides that the pizza is tasty. The crust is cracker like but the toppings were full of flavor. Food is ordered Very similar to a chipotle but the food is not naturally raised meats and organic locally grown produce. Good not great..."}
{"text":"i was not impressed at all. My pizza must have been done earlier than quoted, because it was pretty much cold, and i ordered while i was in the Target parking lot. I was there exactly on time. The salad was awful, even though i ordered with the toppings i wanted, it barely had any of the toppings, and it was all crammed in this little plastic container. Not appealing at all, and  was really hoping i would like it."}
{"text":"Thanks MOD Pizza for a fantastic GF pizza on teacher appreciation day. I had never been in before but I will definitely be back. The pizza was great, the environment was fun and the service was super fast. This would be a great place to bring my family."}
{"text":"Mod pizza is awesome!!! You can put however many toppings you want on your pizza for the same price. Also, unlike a similar pizza place, they have more than 1 size. The mini is the perfect size for the kids. The mod size is perfect for adults. I heard there was an even bigger size but I have never seen it. There caramel pear iced tea is wonderful. Everyone can order what they want on their pizza (or salad) and be happy."}
{"text":"Good pizza plus good prices and good tasting, it is a little confusing if it's your first time..it's like a subway for pizza..don't recommend  the garlic strips (pizza dough with a crap ton of garlic on top)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Convenient located at Tempe Marketplace away from the crowded food Court area.  I've been to other Mod Pizza's before where sometimes the personnel and portions are subpar. The Tempe Marketplace location is outstanding! Kai, Topher and Joel are the absolute best!! Always greeted with a smile and speedy service.  Portions are always plentiful and fresh. I like to mix it up between the Mod pizza and salad.  Fresh lemonades and ice teas are also a good go-to.   They also other an ASU discount! Go Devils!"}
{"text":"Great value. The pizza and salads taste really good and are made with quality ingredients. Normally don't get drinks when we eat out but the marion berry lemonade is a must have.  Great place to go for a quick dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"Chiplote-style serving meets Pizza - AWESOME! I had the valencia that has sir...racha sauce and man it sounds weird but so delicious. Better than red sauce pizza!"}
{"text":"Great pizza at a great price! Create your own pizza can't get any better than this. My first time trying this place and I'm satisfied. Toppings are endless and the crust is right on! I'll definitely be back. If you haven't tried it, you should."}
{"text":"Always great pizza!' Great to build your own.. I love how Crispy and crunchy it gets and it's done in like under 5 minutes"}
{"text":"Awesome experience on a Friday night. After walking out of another restaurant for being ignored, we found this place to be a total lifesaver! From the moment we arrived, everyone was super friendly and the food was fresh and delicious. We were able to sit outside with our dogs, a huge bonus! I can't wait to come back and try something new!"}
{"text":"Ok guys I have a confession, I adore Mod Pizza, I know it shocks me too because I am not a huge fan of pizza, but Mod has won me over!  It's all about the crust; it's the best part of the pizza, well besides to the toppings but the crust is amazing. Cooked perfect every time!  My favorite is the Caspian, mozzarella, gorgonzola, bbq chicken, bbq sauce, red onions and to that I add pineapple and jalapenos and this pizza tastes amazing! Pineapple and chicken on pizza go perfectly together, if you don't believe me, try it and you will see! Soo dang good!  At Mod Pizza, you can design your pizza any way you want it and it's all just one great price! Yep I am a fan of Mod!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've eaten here and the pizzas came out it very different times .  the people at my table got the pizzas several minutes ahead of me. Also the pizzas were very inconsistently cooked.  My cheese was not even melted in the middle very disappointing. I decided not to send my pizza back because by the time I got it cooked everyone else would've been"}
{"text":"Been here a few times all great experiences, you get more bang for your buck eating here. $7 and some change you can put whatever you want on your pie. Fresh good ingredients, great pizza. It doesn't fill my hubby up but he can eat a large NYPD pizza alone lol so it's more of a lunch spot for us than dinner."}
{"text":"I got to say they have super friendly staff. The place is always kept clean, ingredients fresh, and all the toppings you can think of.  The pizza is pretty good tasting.  The stuff over here is saying that it was a birthday and they made us a desert pizza, that was really cool and unnecessary. They have a few selection on ice tea and lemonade. I love it so I can make my own version of Arnold Palmer."}
{"text":"First time here and I made up a salad pizza which I had not eaten since I moved to the valley in the 90's.  So good I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I wish I could have given this place 10 stars! Amazing pizza and great prices! I love the upbeat and friendly atmosphere, the staff was awesome Jenny was so nice from the time I walked through the doors to the time I left, she made my first experience at MOD AWESOME! I would definitely recommend to all my friends, I'll be back soon! And anyone wanting a great tasting pizza with a twist try the Calexico! Three words... Oh. My. Gawd! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch places you get a personal customized pizza and drink for about $10 bucks ! You can put all the toppings you want on your pizza , it's really tasty friendly staff . Also they have handcrafted lemonades which are delicious and classic drink machine , will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"What a great concept!! We were greeted right away and felt welcomed as soon as we walked in the door.  Staff is great!! Pizzas were good too. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I really can't say anything about the food, as I never got through the line to order.  The first time the line was out to the door, and I stood there for several minutes, not even getting close enough to look at the menu to decide if I wanted to eat there.  The second time, my companion wanted pizza, so we stood in the line, and it was not as long, so we got up to the menus and began thinking about what to order.  For each person in line, the workers would start the orders and very slowly move them down the assembly line to make your pizza or salad.  But they also had about what looked like at least 2 door-dash or other delivery orders per person on top of being amazingly slow in their work.  We were third in line and watched this with some concern, as it took forever to get up to the counter.  Finally we got up to the counter and the line person, without a word started making another door-dash order and her co-worker wandered off, bored as he waited for her.  I thought after she made the door dash she might at least speak to us, but instead she picked up the next door dash order, so we walked over to Chipotle.  The sign outside says \"super fast\" but it appears to be false advertising, based on my experience."}
{"text":"My son loooooves pizza so when good grades come home every quarter this is my go to place. Although a bit high on price for a small tiny pizza, I still fork over the money for well earned grades. My son loves that he can choose his own toppings! I have had the pizza myself twice and I think it tastes pretty darn good. Only reason I gave 4 stars is because sometimes customer service isn't that great. Hit or miss on who is working and how that person's day is going I guess..."}
{"text":"I got a free pizza coupon in the mail a week ago and decided, why not.  Let me back up, I wasn't too thrilled about another pizza place coming to the area.  I think we have five, now six within a 1 mile radius.  Anyway I digress.  I came into MOD pizza with my teenage guy for lunch.  As soon as I stepped in the place, I got a shower of greetings!  I approached the counter and the guy was very helpful explaining everything.  Think of Subway for pizza.  I got to choose what I wanted to put on it.  I went generic (my family doesn't like to take risks in life) cheese, pepperoni, black olives, mushrooms.  The sauce, oh my goodness, where have you been all my life?  Simply the best sauce so far!!!  The crust is okay, not the cat's meow, but okay.  Let me give you a tip.  Remember when Hostess made delicious Ding Dongs?  This  MOD pizza has a stack of Ding Dong-esk cakes in silver wrappers.  Not only are they worthy of the size, they are soooooo good!!!  How good?  Cat's meow good!"}
{"text":"Good place to make your own pizza! The staff is very helpful and friendly.  Great atmosphere to enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"Came here after a movie, great pizza, staff was super helpful explaining what to order.  I'll definitely come again next time I see a movie."}
{"text":"We go to MOD once a week as they have great pizza toppings and friendly employees. Unfortunately, I was in the men's bathroom and an employee used the restroom and changed his clothes, and then flushed the toilet. He walked out of the bathroom w/o washing his hands. I brought it to the managers attention and said he would take care of it as the employee proceeded to make pizzas for the rest of my 30 min visit. Never pulled him from the line making pizzas. Even with gloves... I want to know employees are washing their hands after their touch or use anything in a bathroom. I was ignored and the issue was not addressed. I would have pulled him and said go wash your hands- he would have learned a life lesson. No more MOD for us! NOTE: Owner contacted me to inquire upon employee and was very nice to offer another experience. I don't like to disclose my personal info. I believe owner will address this issue ASAP and he Offered great customer service."}
{"text":"We've been waiting for MOD to open near our house, and were not disappointed. We've hit nearly all the create-your-own pizza joints, so I'll sum up what I liked about MOD.  *I LOVE that they offer three sizes of pizzas: the mini, the original 11\" and the mega. (Mega is 11\" but thick crust.) *Their regular dough is crispy, with a cracker-like consistency. *Service is fast and friendly. *My son liked the garlic spread you can put on your pizza. *The inside of the restaurant is spacious and airy. *They have a wide variety of beverage options.  All in all, it seems like a place we will definitely be returning to."}
{"text":"Honestly it's MOD if you don't know you're late. This location in particular is amazing! The food was delicious as always but the atmosphere is everything. The General Manager Mike is the man. Definitely a perfect quick bite."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time with my family 2 days ago. I was excited to see that you can put however many toppings you want on your pizza at no extra charge. I love how customizable it is. The ingredients were fresh, my pizza and side salad were great. The caramelized pear tea was delicious and it was decaf which is a plus for me since I'm pregnant and staying away from caffeine. Some people on here are complaining about the price but I thought it wasn't bad. Especially for the amount of toppings you can get. Other pizza places put a limit on that. The girl that helped us was friendly and patient. The restaurant was very clean. Oh and the best part: they have dairy free cheese as an option for those of you that love animals."}
{"text":"I really need to come here more. The food is outstanding and they are always extremely friendly. My favorite is the Caspian but I've never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at how much food you get for cheap. The unlimited toppings are unbeatable at the price of $8.00, allowing you to perfectly customize your pizza. On top of that, the pizza is cooked in a fire oven and came out absolutely delicious! Becky was a lot of fun to talk to and gave excellent customer service the entire visit. I will be back many more times in the future as this is now my go-to pizza place. Excellent, fantastic, superb! Try it out, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"So I had been reading all the hype about this place and my daughter and I needed some place to stop and have a bite to eat so we ended up here. Now I can understand all of the high reviews and four and five stars. I love the concept and being able to choose what all you want on your pizza without having to pay outrageous prices for every extra topping. They have so many different items that the combinations would be endless. My masterpiece consisted of red sauce with grilled chicken, roasted red peppers, broccoli, roasted brussels sprouts, and both mozzarella and ricotta cheese. Then it was drizzled with a balsamic fig reduction when it came out of the oven. I didn't get to try the salad although I'm sure that will happen in the near future!"}
{"text":"I think this is my new favorite pizza place! I love the fact that you can make it however you want with as little or as many toppings as you wish. And all at the same price! Same with the salads! You would think with choices like these you would be paying an arm and a leg.  However it's just the opposite. Less than $8.00 and you get a pretty good size pizza that will fill you up. I love the fact that their crust is thin and crispy as well. And the balsamic fig drizzle that you can have added onto it after it is baked is to die for! Definitely a place I recommend and can see myself coming back to many times!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times...and love it! Staff is friendly, food is great and the place is always clean. Brian ( the GM) always makes a point to stop by. Great customer service. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Do not go to this location ! They literally just charged me 1.47$ for some damn ice. I'm fighting a cold so I didn't even have the energy to argue. But I did question the girl that gave me the cup & I said you charged me 1.47 for this? She literally walked away she was so damn rude. This is my second time going to this location& my last. the first time I came & they rise I just figured oh no they just opened so it's okay. No this is what they do!! Get some new workers with respect! This shxx is ridiculous! I will be calling tomorrow to speak with the manager hopefully my damn voice is back by then ! I will happily go to the Steele Creek location with no problem as I've never had any issues...shxx is ridiculous"}
{"text":"I've heard such great things about this place and they don't have a gluten free option for a small pizza :("}
{"text":"AMAZING PIZZA.   Forget the big pizza chains. The price here and amount of toppings (amazing flavors) make this the best pizza place     I don't like tomato sauce on pizza. I get pesto and garlic here.   This place also has vegan cheese.   So win for the vegans.   I have yet to try the salads, but I'm sure they are amazing."}
{"text":"Great people. Pizza is crazy good. Thin crust. Interesting flavors and flourish. Great space in the restaurant too. Music. Tables. Lots to offer. My kids were happy. I got the Valencia and loved it (as if anything with chorizo wouldn't be the best)."}
{"text":"Crazy good pizza and salads! Very attentive staff, cool decor, and great air-conditioning. Try the Canon club salad - it's the best of both worlds, combining a warm pizza crust with a delicious salad."}
{"text":"Just tried Mod Pizza for the first time. Loved it! Pizza was great. Fast turnaround time for the food. Great for a lunch break. The thing that really stood out (apart from the food being great) was the service. Everyone was really friendly. The manager saw that my toddler was  fussy and crying so he brought out milkshakes for the kids to help cheat him up. He didn't charge us either which was just great. This was a great 1st experience and I'll be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I love the concept of this place. It's a make your own pizza where (similar to chipotle) you go through a line at the counter to choose what you'd like on your pizza.   Unlike other similar restaurants, you get as many toppings you'd like for the same price. I got spinach, basil, tomatoes, sauce, cheese and a pesto finish. They also have recommendations for what to pick together (pizza list) that you can choose.   The pizza turned out okay. It tasted good, but it wasn't anything special even with my toppings. Crust was fine but nothing special. I'll be trying different toppings next time.   I got the regular size (11\") and was full after eating half of it, so I got to take part of it home."}
{"text":"I had the \"Calexico\" pizza, it was delicious. This is wood fired pizza done right. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that it's slightly confusing to order. You can get custom pizzas much the same way you would order at Subway or Chipotle. I picked the number I wanted but they still ask you if you want each ingredient on it. Simple enough, I just told them I want whatever comes with that number, I didn't see all of the toppings listed in the number available at the counter, but then I realized that the rest are \"finishers\" which are applied after cooking and are available around the other side of the counter. Not really a big deal but now I know so I can try other finishers in the future. Staff was happy and friendly. They had a very small section of beer and wine on tap but I couldn't try them on my lunch break. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Freakin phenomenal! This place was fast fresh delicious thin crust crispy pizza with amazing good toppings and a super easy menu! Personal pizzas and salads! It tastes so good I can't think of a better thin crispy crust off top of my head! Staff was very nice! And fast! They have shakes too! Awesome! Mmmmmm...I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Great food!! The pizza is so good and different from what I've had before. They are thin crust pizza's and you can get an individual or larger size. Love that you can choose a pizza off of the menu or pick your own toppings. The Lucy Sunshine with chicken was delicious. Very friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"It's what you expect when a bunch of 17 year olds are running the place. Rude, disrespectful, and rushed. The area behind the counter was filthy with trash all over the floor. Trash bins were over flowing. The ladies room was disgusting and smelly.  My veg pizza was good but they burned the GF pizza my friend ordered. Hint: you can't cook a GF pizza Long !!  I go to pieology in San Diego where I live ( same concept as this place ) and I've never been disappointed.  My friend and I will never be back here even though she lives down the street.  The filth was too much for us. Gave 2 stars because pizza was good."}
{"text":"Big big fan of MOD pizza. I had them originally on a trip to Seattle a few years back. The concept is simple and delicious. Pick all the toppings you want and they fire it in their oven. They also have beer and wine on tap.   Prices are very reasonable. Pizza is under $8. Glass of wine $5. Quality is great and they are quick. What a time to be alive."}
{"text":"Ordered online scheduled to be picked up at 5:45 PM WALKED IN AT 5:40 PM EMPLOYEE at register says oh it will be a while we have not even started your order. First last time for MOD Missed Order Dude.  BTW after 6pm no pizzas."}
{"text":"Made to order pizza...Fast.  I love this concept, and they pull it off well.  You build your pizza from the ground up.  You get to choose the type of sauce, cheese, and all the toppings.  They do have some pizza ideas already ready if you want to order off that, but I like to choose my own stuff each time.  They have a lot of topping choices, and the toppings a fresh.  Everyone is always in a good mood, and smiling.  This really adds to the experience."}
{"text":"I love this place; Their black raspberry lemonade is delicious, and the pizza is awesome! Its quick, really cheap, and absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I keep getting brought here by friends that swear by this place.  I love the concept but I just can't love their crust.  I am a crust girl and theirs is nothing more than a glorified tortilla.  I am sure I will return when friends drag me back but I won't go on my own volition."}
{"text":"Man they are cheap when it comes to extra cheese, they barley put any in the first place. BLAH!"}
{"text":"First time in today and it was great! Friendly and helpful staff right when we walked in. Cool concept with making your own pizza or you can choose from their creations. Can add all the fresh ingredients that you'd like for the base price of the pizza size; don't have to worry about up charges after everything you put on. Pizza was delicious out of the pizza oven and took no time at all! Definitely will revisit the next time it's a pizza night."}
{"text":"Never going to this mod location again!!!! Rude workers. Bad vibe. I couldn't believe how mel (the general manager) treated me, the customers in front of me and the other workers!!! Who in their right mind put this God awful person in charge?? I asked for a new cup after she knocked it off the counter when she handed me my receipt to sign. She rolled her eyes, huffed and puffed, and when I said thanks she gave me some snide remark. After that I heard her call me an a**hole when she turned around! I couldn't believe it. No there seemed happy, but who blames them, having that nut job in charge. I'm definitely going back to the gilbert or chandler location next time."}
{"text":"Ok so I made a review about mod pizza near the santan mall a while ago, I had stated that the place was clean and the employee's are cool, but the one employee that was drunk made me uncomfortable.. Anyways I went in Saturday around like 6 and I was really impressed about the entire staff! The drunk guy wasn't there(which is a plus) but seriously everyone was energetic and helpful even though it was a bit busy. Everyone was moving fast and seemed happy to be there. Honestly mod is so much better than blaze just because of the employees. A few people stood out to me. I don't know their names, but one was a girl with red hair and a guy wearing a goofy ranger hat and a pony tail. They were so helpful and even helped me with what kind of toppings I should put on my pizza because I was bored with what I normally do. They suggested I get the Calexico with bacon and some siracha-ranch and it was amazing!! When the guy with the hat called my name it made me crack up with how he said it and how funny he was in general. Everyone there seems to love their job and that makes me happy and want to come back!! I'm definitely getting that same pizza next time I go in!!!!!"}
{"text":"Well they say you make your own pizza, however, I would not have done this to my own pizza. I got two pizzas. One mod, and one mini, they were both put in a bag flat. However, when I got home and open the bag and box to my pizza, this is what it looked like. One of the pizzas was fine, the other one had clearly been miss handled, and the cheese and all the toppings had slid to one side. There is no way that this could've happened without any employee knowing. Somebody had to of seen and known that they did this. Yet they still put it in my bag. I am highly disappointed. I am a loyal customer to mod pizza. And this, is simply ridiculous."}
{"text":"I'm originally from the East Coast and I've been in the valley almost a year.  I keep searching for good pizza and haven't had much luck finding it.  Friends here also from back East told me that there really is not good pizza here.    My friends lied to me.  MOD is amazingly good.  If you like thin crust made to order pizza, hit this place up now.    The best part of MOD?  I tried the gluten free crust and it was awesome.  Crispy and chewy at the same time."}
{"text":"Really good lunch.  Similar concept to pie ology but much better.  Flatbread style pizza and salads of your own construction. We really liked the make your own tossed salads.  Also getting a 6in pizza for lunch allowed us both to have it our way.  Nice to have another good west side lunch spot.  We will be back for sure"}
{"text":"On par with all the walk in pizza places where your order your pie just the way you like it.  Kept ours simple and enjoyed the quick service.  There was a trainee at the register who seemed befuddled but other than that, it was a good experience. The pie was great with raw garlic, roasted garlic cloves, sun dried tomatoes, roasted kale, a few fresh tomatoes, mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.  We'd go back if in the area."}
{"text":"This was our first time, after hearing about it locally. Went this last Sunday around 11:30am, wasn't busy and found a table once we ordered.  We each ordered our own mini size. The mini size (6\"?) was perfect for my wife, however I felt slightly hungry afterwards. I went w/ the James Dillon and added mushrooms. My wife had the Calexico and she liked it a lot.  Price on the mini is very reasonable. The next size up is about $7 and is 11\" which would be slightly more than some people can handle.  Good selection of toppings. Had some good beers (bottled) and some on tap.  I think some wine by the glass but not sure where/what it was. I think a beer/wine glass was $4-5. Sodas are almost $2 but includes refills and they have nice looking iced tea and lemonade.  Staff was friendly and says hello and goodbye as a group, to all patrons entering and exiting. You can order online too.  FYI - these are thin crust pizzas, not thick or regular.   Gluten Free Options Available!"}
{"text":"First off, I love MOD pizza!  Delicious, and very reasonably priced.  This location however, is absolutely disgusting!!!  Almost everyone who works there was filthy and frankly very unpresentable.   Every female and even a long haired male had their hair down and was flopping all over the place (not one hat or hair net).  I watched a worker pick two boxes up off of the filthy ground and place them on the pizza (tray line) surface.  Then, with the same gloves opened up the supplies, and refilled the the veggies.  Another worker who was supposed to make our salad touched her face multiple times with her gloves on, picked something up off the ground and threw it in the trash, then went into the fridge and stuck her hands into a bucket of artichokes to refill her bin.  Finally, the worker who mixed the salad did it with her hands after she was working the cash register!!! Yes, she had gloves on but did not change them, after touching money.  While waiting for our pizza's to cook, my wife and I decided we were too grossed out to eat here.  I explained to the manager(s) he and she really didn't seem to care about what happened.  They did kindly refund our money and we left.  Like I mentioned  earlier we have been to many MOD locations, and their food is great!  However, this was one of the grossest experiences I can recall.  If anyone from the health department reads these comments, Please pay this location a visit!!!!!"}
{"text":"We love to take the kids here. They have so many choices, and the wood-fired pizza tastes great. They do a good salad as well."}
{"text":"Delicious! Price is right and pick your own pizza toppings...what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"If you are thinking about visiting mod read this review!!!!!!!!!  I recently discovered Mod pizza and i do have to say that I am in love with this place!! If you are on lunch order online and pick it up, but if you forget to order online don't worry your STONE FIRED pizza will be ready before you know it!! Pizzas come in a 6inch, 11 inch or a double crust 11 inch, you can choose from one of their pizzas or customize a pizza with any toppings you want!!! No seriously, any toppings for the same price!!! (Kinda like building a sub at subway but 1000% better ingredients here) The mini is 6 inches and $4.47, the mod size is 11 inches and it is $7.47!! I think the double is around $10.  This pizza is one of the best pizzas I have ever had.  When you next want pizza forget dominos, forget Pizza Hut or any other pizza chain and do yourself a favor and head over to Mod pizza at metro center in Phoenix, trust me, you won't be sorry.  Also be prepared for your pizza love to start. Don't be surprised if you eat here all the time, You are welcome in advance ;) oh and P.S they sell beer on tap!!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh - I am DEFINITELY coming back to this place!  The service was excellent - very friendly and swift!   The pizza was so delicious and I loved the selection of sauces and toppings. Pesto is amazing!   This place is like the pizza version of subway, but more delicious! Try it out at least once! You can get a mini pizza for $5!"}
{"text":"I'm not usually a pizza fan but lately I've been craving it. MOD could be an indicator for my unusual craving all of a sudden. After my first visit I was hooked and came back for more within a week!   My first time visiting, everyone was friendly and nice. I chose the MOD size pizza which is a medium sized pizza. About 4 slices. It's perfect for 1-2 people or 1 hungry person  I like that you can choose unlimited toppings for no extra charge. The option is up to you on how you want to create your pizza from the sauce base to the toppings. They also have custom made pizzas for you to chose from if you aren't sure what to get. Salads are available here, also.   Happy hour is the best! Beers on tap, need I say more? My favorite is the Orange Blossom!"}
{"text":"Super fun!  Build your own pizza! Get it how you want it! Tons of ingredients. I am so thrilled I can't even describe how awesome this place is!  Prices are great too."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed MOD Pizza. When we went in we did not realize it was a build your own pizza or salad. My husband and I split a personal size pizza. Each putting the ingredients that we liked on our half. The pizza was perfectly prepared. The young man that waited on us when we first went in had great personality. He was very helpful as was everyone else that was working there. We definitely want to go back both for the taste of the pizza and for the price. Next time I think I will also have a small dinner salad to go with it."}
{"text":"Great pizza!!! Really cool vibes and nice set up. Rolling glass garage doors open up and let you enjoy the Arizona spring. I like that you can literally put anything you want. Pizza is slightly thinner than I would love but that's just how these places are. My kids like it and I'm able to customize it so that they each get half a pizza rather than them only eating half and never finishing the rest. Cool little beer selection on tap and bottles. Will definitely be coming back.  You can customize or they have some pretty cool set ups already. My wife enjoyed their salad and was glad she is able to customize that as well. They had some really good teas as well. Will probably become one of our regular spots!!!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time dining at MOD pizza. Wow, what a great concept. Finally an affordable gourmet type pizza  The crust is a thin crispy crust that is topped with a flavorful sauce with any number of toppings and combinations. No deluxe pie here and no \"no substitutions\" signs. You are encouraged to make your pizza your own.  My son had the cheese  of course. I had several toppings and have to say, and I worked in the pizza restaurant business for approx 8 years, that this is probably The best pizza I have tried. I will be back again this week and will be a regular stop. I like Grimaldis but the price keeps me away. No such problem here.  Way to go guys!"}
{"text":"MOD pizza is my new favorite place to eat. We eat there at least twice a week now. Fresh ingredients, friendly staff, and great pizza. You get unlimited toppings for one price!  They also carry local craft beer. Our family LOVES MOD. It is definitely a great addition to our area."}
{"text":"First time try it oh was delicious pizza any topping you want and the Garlic dipping oh love it and service was nice and great definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Went into this spot about 30 mins before close with the misses last night to order some grub after a hard day of moving. A young guy was outside closing down shop by putting up some chairs on the patio, but he greeted us warmly. When we get inside, I advise the cashier that I was there to pick up a call in order and five minutes later, we had pizza! The only issue that arose was whoever took my order took it down wrong. The guy who was outside was now in the kitchen and sensing that something was wrong he asked was my order ok. When I told him that I wanted to add olives and Canadian bacon to my Del Monico, and take off the tomatoes, he immediately sprung into action by making me another pizza, and I had it and was out of the door in seven minutes. Nearly half the staff, including the young guy was seeming working all over the store apologized for the mix up. The pizza was great, but the customer experience was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I enjoy going to MOD lots of great toppings and really good pizza. The Happy Hour special I attended was worth it too. One downside the wait time in line can be a bit long however when it your turn the topping and salad selections are unlimited. A huge plus is the gluten free crust!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my MOD!!  F R E S H, F A S T, all the toppings you can pile on.  Love that I can make my own custom pizza.  Very friendly staff.  We eat here a couple times a month!!!"}
{"text":"1st time at Mod Pizza and we loved it.  Great atmosphere and the kiddos loved ordering their own pizzas.  Will definitely return  We had the Caesar Salad and the Dominic pizza (white sauce).  Should have upsized the pizza. It was that good"}
{"text":"Found this place a few weeks ago and been back about 4 times. All the toppings you want for $7.50!!! Can't beat that, it's like little Caesars pricing. It's not the best I've ever had but it's pretty damn awesome. Staff is always friendly and working there buts off. If you haven't been give it a try.   p.s. I wouldn't bother with the shakes...."}
{"text":"I am updating my review based on our experience tonight.  We had 2 great mini pizzas with great service.  It was not as crazy busy, the music level was just right, and the front patio was open for a nice indoor/outdoor kind of vibe.  Also, we could people watch as randomness walked by.  Pizzas and drinks were very good, and being that it was not opening night, we really enjoyed the custom pizzas with less noise.  I think we will be back for the week day affordable food, quality beverages, friendly service, and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with all the options available here. At least 9 different pizza options, a few salad options, and also the opportunity to build your own pizza or salad. The pizzas come in different sizes, and  the small 6\" size is a perfect lunch portion, and not too bad calorie-wise either.   I have eaten here twice and each time the pizza has been really good. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful in recommending ingredients and dining options. Definitely a place I will be back to multiple times."}
{"text":"This is a cool, modern place; I liked the decor and ambiance. I love how you can build your own pizza (like Chipotle or Subway) or just order a classic one for the same price, no matter the number of toppings. The 11\" Mod pizza was the perfect size for one adult. It tasted great! These pizzas have a thin crust, which I'm not usually a fan of. But I was really satisfied with this one. They even have a gluten free crust!! Great for those trying to lose weight or gluten intolerant. My husband ordered one and it was amazingly tasty!! There will be cross contamination however, for people with Celiac's disease.  So we are definitely going back to Mod Pizza. Super pleased with this place."}
{"text":"Employees are super friendly! And the pizza is so yummy!we come here often and they always are great!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Mod Pizza. I discovered it a few months ago and have gone at least once a week since then. The staff is always pretty friendly and upbeat. The prices are reasonable and they don't charge extra for additional toppings."}
{"text":"I worked at a pizza place while in college and I loved making my own pizza for my meal breaks, I made it exactly how I liked it. This is the feel I had at MOD Pizza. The flavor of the pizza was great, it was made quickly and to my specs, and good pricing. All of the kids loved it too. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome it's just like Blaze and pieology.. Same concept build ur own pick one of ours...it feels like \"the chipotle of pizza\" we love the build ur own pie just bc we are a family of 4 and myself and our youngest son aren't fans of red sauce so we usually do olive oil instead and cheese along with the usually meats and veggies.  My fiancé and oldest son are more traditional red sauce pepperoni they keep it simple. We also got the garlic strips... They are ok it's like peta bread with garlic and tons of rosemary .. Nothing fancy.. We will be back to MOD we love pizza and this place our family can get what they want and not throw a fit.."}
{"text":"Not wanting to cook and wanting to try something new, I opted for MOD Pizza, which had recently been opened in the old Ray's spot at Signal Butte.  The online ordering on my phone was not the most user-friendly nor organized, but it eventually got the job done. I ordered a MOD mad dog pizza, garlic strips with ranch and a salted toffee milkshake.  The shop was bright, open and clean. I liked the open atmosphere and the pizza creation counter, where you can see you items being prepared. My items were ready and waiting for me, with no issues. The staff was super friendly and customer service oriented. Anyone who has read me previous reviews know that I'm a hard-ass when it comes to customer service! These ladies were awesome.  From the east coast, I see myself as a pizza connoisseur.  I was not impressed.  First, let's talk size. The MOD size pizza was essentially a small. 4 large slices for a 10-12\" pie. The crust was crispy. Not cooked crispy. Like inflated then cooked crispy. The pizza was thin. This pepperoni and sausage pizza had good flavor, and would have folded nicely had it not been for the crumbly, inflated crust. The garlic strips blew me away. I opened the box and burst out laughing. This was a small round of crispy dough with garlic, butter and parmesan. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty. But this thing was, at most, 6\" in diameter and super thin. I felt like I should have hummus instead of ranch, and the two cups of ranch that came with it could have been enough for a good dozen of those little suckers.  The milkshake was.the.jam. Salted toffee for days and the base was super creamy and delicious. It filled me up where my pizza failed to. (Let me clarify that I halved this order with my husband.)   I would probably try other options here, especially with the lack of options in this area. But this far, I am not impressed."}
{"text":"MOD is the best!!  Great service.  Great pizza!!  Great prices!!  Definitely 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"All time favorite mod location!! I came in with my bf and was immediately greeted by the whole crew! Becky took care of our orders, she was a sweetheart and super friendly not mention makes a perfect pie! Great energy in this place I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"A make your own pizza concept ala Subway! Love the idea but it's not just the idea that makes it so great.   Decor : Industrial hip and chill!!  Food : Ingredients were a LOT fresher than what I'm used to from the usual chains (Pizza Hut, Dominos...). The Variety on offer was surprisingly awesome (Roasted Garlic, Ricotta!!!).... Their dough and further the pizza base is made fresh and your customization is limitless!! (Okay a hint of exaggeration there but really impressive). I love the fact that they have sauces OTHER than a Red and White as well (Including a Pesto one!).                  I love their version of Bread-sticks. They were carved out of a thin pizza itself and were very flavorful! Pair them with one of their nicer dips (Hello again Pesto!!) and it elevates what you know of a bread-stick!  Service : Fast and Friendly! Every pizza is cared for and the server works with you on ingredients no matter how crazy or many they are.  Price/Value : For less than $5 for a 6inch pizza, it's an incredible value if you look at the fact that you can choose as many ingredients as you want on it. No questions asked.  I'll be sure to make many more trips to satiate my mix n match desires. Here's hoping they continue dong well!!"}
{"text":"I really love this place ! You build your own pizzas here and it's cooked in a brick oven ... Only taking 7 min ! Pizza is fresh and delicious! You create it and they bake it I love this place !"}
{"text":"I love MOD Pizza. You can get a pizza or salad with any of their fabulous toppings, even meat, for one low price. The pizzas come out pretty quickly and the staff is always friendly, what's not to love? This has become my new favorite pizza place for lunch near Fort Mill."}
{"text":"Love this place... awesome flat breads with lots of fresh veggies to choose from. ( I'm not your basic pepperoni pizza chick) . Friendly, fast, serves beet and wine and the balsamic glaze is the shit ... if i feel like being bad and having a pizza this is a top pick."}
{"text":"Good customer service , I had small problem (because I am very picky ) and I got a message making it right will be back , thanks"}
{"text":"The food quality and service were on point. We were greeted immediately and offered some of the house specialties when making our selections. Food was made quickly and presented well. I also was able to witness the store manager handle a cranky customer with an issue with their order and she handled it like a champ and remedied the situation immediately, exactly what you want to see as a fellow customer. Will be back."}
{"text":"Great concept of one set price, but it sucks they go skimpy on the sauce and cheese. Sad part is I even asked for extra sauce and cheese trying to correct it. This was my 2nd visit since moving back to ahwatukee and unfortunately my last visit."}
{"text":"This location has such nice, helpful people along with great food. I highly recommend you try it. You'll be back forsure. Friendly service and the build your own pizza is the best. Yummy"}
{"text":"It's the best!  I love the thinner crust and the wood fire taste.  Best of all....you can pile anything and everything that you want on the pizza and it's still only $7.49!  Staff if friendly, helpful and there if you need anything! Plus the General Manager is awesome!  He remembers us every time we come in (at least once a week)!  A must try for pizza lovers."}
{"text":"Double dough pizza is good. Good place to go when you want a quick pizza.  Many of these places popping up around town, they are all very similar. Fired, Fired pie, they are all the same concept."}
{"text":"Ok, so I'm seriously obsessed with mod pizza, so much that I've eaten here three times this week. Yes judge me if you wish lol, but the pizza is amazing, and I can select all my tops and have a beer for $10.00! Nope can't beat that at all.   I recommend this place for lunch or dinner, families, and quick friend gatherings. I've experienced all the above here and it's been a hit every time, especially with the kids because they can pick whatever that would like to eat. Thank GOD the don't offer cookies and sprinkles because my niece and nephew would really have a field day!   Thank you MOD for expanding my pizza palette, and allowing great options and loaves of yummy goodness!   Keep up the fantastic job!"}
{"text":"Pizzas here are a great deal and yummy, many choices on toppings on your Pizza. Point at the toppings you want. There are about 20 choices, including Canadian bacaon, roasted garlic and kale. But we must give huge kudos to Ricky and employees. It was my daughter's Bday party and not only did Ricky and employees welcome us, they provided upscale balloons, props, etc. Daughter and friends had an awesome time. My wife's great BDay party idea .... Take kids to Harkins Shea movies and then walk to MOD Pizza!!"}
{"text":"Dinner time on a Saturday and the place is packed. \"Subway\" style pizza shop where you call the shots on your pie. Tons of options to choose from for about $8 per 11\" inch pizza.  Staff is always friendly when we come here and they work hard!  Internet ordering is too easy and almost fun if you rather takeout."}
{"text":"This is one of our new favorite places.  We had never been and had such a good experience it made our night thanks to Becky and the staff!  The food was delicious and we left with smiles on our faces."}
{"text":"My family eats here 2-3 times a week and everyone is always so friendly and take such good care of us on those days we are too busy to make dinner. It is great to have such good food at a nice place where they know their customers. Five star service every time. (Bill and family)"}
{"text":"I'm a fan, like the subway of pizza places. You can customize your pizza however you like or choose premade varieties. Their portion sizes are also not too big (unlike many restaurants which gets you fat) or small. I thought the ingredients were fresh and lots of friendly staff. Nice bathrooms and soda fountain varieties. Outdoor seating is a plus."}
{"text":"I want to clarify that I am not an employee or acquaintance of any owner when writing this review. I went on opening day and I was very satisfied when leaving. Yes there is music playing but it is an upbeat place full of employees who are enjoying themselves. The employees were very friendly and helped communicate with you when designing your pizza. The ingredients are fresh, the gluten free crust was delicious, and the place was clean. I will continue to tell people good things about MOD and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is Nothing special, pizza is like plastic with no taste! And its like eating at the DMV! Will pass!!"}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend this pizza place to anyone who is a fan of pizza. It is cool to make your own pizza as you go and it is decently priced. Probably what you would expect to spend on a lunch. Really fresh food and low wait times with a cool original atmosphere."}
{"text":"I recently came here as it's a new business that opened up in a newer business development site next to a sprouts. I will break this down in different sections for what I believe to be highlights!  Décor: As soon as you walk into the door, you feel like the space is grand and open. You see the hot oven, and it's CLEAN. OMG I love when a restaurant is clean. They have a breakdown on how to order the MOD way, and a list of different creations that they recommend. Btw, they also have a local beer selection, I only saw 2. BUT STILL!!!  Food: Now for the most common size, it was big enough for my daughter and I to share. You get unlimited toppings, but obviously they can't add a ton or the pizza won't come off the peel. You get more with less! We also ordered the garlic strips. The pizza itself is thin crust, and has a beautiful crust to it. Snaps, and slight char. Can't ask for a better crust! The sauce and everything works great together. You also can finish off your pie with a couple different options, E.G. Ranch, Hot Sauce, Pesto. The garlic strips were surprisingly good as well, the fresh rosemary really made a difference.   Service: The staff there was a real treat. They were all willing to explain how to order the best pie, which creations they believe were the best. They were patient, and incredibly nice. Once your pie is done, they make sure everything looks correct, and make sure you're completely taken care of.   Overall: This place is a very welcome gem in Mesa. I can't wait to come back for more, and try out the different pies, beer, and amazingly fresh lemonade they have there!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and check them out. We've come several times and order something different each time. We've been pleased EVERY time. My husband and I usually get a salad (mini) and a custom pizza (mini) and share with each other. Great dinner at a great price!!"}
{"text":"Pizza tasted wonderful!   So many options.  Definitely coming back.  Staff is friendly and efficient.  Recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Cool vibe, friendly staff and great food. Winner! I've been a couple times and both visits have been consistent. A salad and small pizza are the perfect amount for a filling lunch. Create your own pizza from a few base selections...even your own salad. Feeling welcomed while eating fab food. Perfect!"}
{"text":"Convenient and tasty, but there were only two people working during the lunch rush today. One on the assembly line and one on the register/oven/expediting. Not efficient at all. We waited in line for over 15 minutes before we even started building, then had to wait again to pay at the register."}
{"text":"We love this place! My husband and I have been 2 days in a row. We love that you can add as many toppings as you want for one set price. And the lemonade is seriously to die for!! Everyone was so friendly and awesome. We have found our new favorite pizza joint!!"}
{"text":"My bf and I got 2 pizzas and a large drink for $18. Ordering a large pizza from Pizza Hut is $22 and up. I don't even see the reason to get Pizza Hut anymore. This place is much fresher and delicious. I love all the toppings and options to be creative with. I am so impressed with this place! Will be back!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place out! Our cousin loves it! & it's right next to Zero Degrees! Ate out at their outside dining area.   The pizza tasted great and fresh. I think it's made on a flatbread or something thin and although it tasted great I had to give it a 4 star because I didn't like that my toppings slid right off the pizza as I was trying to slice/eat it, also didn't like the crust because it was hard like a cracker and kind of burnt.   I do like the idea of being able to choose & create what makes your pizza. It's cool. The prices are pretty cheap and serving was big. We shared two pizzas between 5 people."}
{"text":"Great for non traditional pizza . Great value , you can get as many topping as you like for the same price. Cool concept and place is always packed. A great idea is to order on their app and than pick up to go ."}
{"text":"I know, I know, another pizza place in Indian Trail. I'm into it, though, because they have a gluten free crust and the option to build your own.   The assembly line is good. If you have more than one pizza in your order, they number your pies accordingly so they don't get lost in the shuffle. There are lots of ingredients to choose from, including a few I haven't seen at other BYO spots, like roasted asparagus and hot honey. I did feel that they were a little stingy with some of the toppings -- the mozzarella cheese on my pizza was far from full-coverage.   The employees working the line were a delight. The young woman coordinating orders asked if my gluten free crust was for an allergy, and if I'd prefer that the folks building my lunch to change their gloves. The next man down the line was happy, helpful, and pleasant, and took ownership of my pizza in an effort to minimize cross-contamination. The gentleman at the end of the line cutting and boxing the pizzas was also enjoyable -- just the right amount of chatty to come off friendly rather than overbearing.   The woman working the oven, though, was awful. I assume she's some level of management, based on the way she continuously inserted herself into other stations on the line and barked at the other workers if they weren't standing in the right spot. When she heard that one of the employees was changing his gloves to build my pizza, she started yelling (at no one in particular) that MOD is not a gluten free environment and that there's \"flour all over this place.\" She spoke about me like I wasn't standing feet away from her as though I was stupid and entitled for ordering a GF crust. She then told the woman coordinating that \"we'll talk about this later.\" I hated the way she spoke to the workers on the line. It was far worse than typical kitchen chatter. She was loud, condescending, and disrespectful.   The pizza, though, came out very well.   I'll give this MOD location another shot, and I hope the folks on the line are treated better on my next visit."}
{"text":"I like the fact that the toppings are unlimited. This is the gimmick.  I usually like thin crust,  but this crust had virtually no flavor and was a bit tough ! Not terrible,  not great. Glad I tried it. Not really in that much in a hurry to go back .....unless it's open late and every  other restaurant is closed.  Update !!  The crust was better during the 2nd visit."}
{"text":"Fast and quality service. Guys working are very cool and down to earth. The manager has worked at a lot of mods and is a great guy. Highly suggest going here or to most mods."}
{"text":"Went there with my brothers in laws wife and sister. Loved that I could put as much of whatever I wanted on it make a truly customizable from the dozens of choices and millions of combinations. The lemonade was also delicious. Everything was fresh and could tell just my by looking at it. Can be really healthy depending what is put on it. Crispy crust good cheese.  I'll be going back there."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time the other day and I just have to say  that it has taken the #1 spot of my favorite pizza place! I love how crispy the crust is and of course the unlimited amount of toppings you can put on it it's A+! The lobby was very clean and the music playing was great! I took a whole bunch of stickers to hand out to my friends. I think the best part of the whole place was the friendly staff. One of the employees saw that I was slowing down a and offered to get me a box to put it in.The manager saw that I was boxing up my pizza and stopped what he was doing to asked about how my food was! 10/10! I will be back, and I will bring all my friends."}
{"text":"Unimpressed....ordered their version of a margarita pizza (Dillon James) the girl makes it and scrapes the bottom of the basil bin, there's maybe 4 teeny-tiny morsels of chopped basil on my pizza, I ask for more and she gives me this huge, whiny ordeal about how she'd have to go chop it, I say 'ok that's fine' all the while wondering, why the other girl who was standing behind the counter texting wasn't actually working and possibly preventing ingredients from being empty....my pizza crust came out BLACK!!! The girl was shocked that my expression was less than thrilled. But by this time I was no longer interested in talking to a hot air ballon. I took my pizza and ate what was edible...."}
{"text":"Thanks MOD for a great night and delicious food. We brought our So Cal Show Baseball team Saturday night for a team dinner. We had great food, great service, and an awesome night making memories. Thanks for treating us right!"}
{"text":"I've been twice in less than a week now.  I love it!  Basically it's like Chipotle, but pizzas instead of burritos.  They offer more than just typical pizza toppings.  I particularly like the whole garlic cloves, the garbanzo beans, and the sauces you can add to the top after your pizza is done cooking (I've tried buffalo, balsamic fig, and red sauce dollops - all excellent!) and my husband really enjoyed the chicken sausage.  The quality seems decent and portions are great too!  Also, any place that has Papago Orange Blossom beer on tap is a friend of mine!  The temperature of my pizza is the only thing I noticed wasn't consistent.  Some of the toppings (maybe the chicken breast) could've been heated a little more, but they're all pre-cooked, so it's just a preference thing not a health thing.  They have calories posted for  the mini maddie (basic - just cheese pizza), but I wish they posted them for the other menu items as well.  Don't forget to try the sweet tarts - they taste like Toaster Strudels.  The strawberry is by far the best, but the blueberry wasn't bad (just intense blueberry)."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and you choose your own toppings. Service was good. It didn't take long for the pizza to come out."}
{"text":"This place is rockin' yummy place? I meant to take half my pizza home? it was too good to stop halfway  The amazingly reasonable price aside ...this is just damn fine pizza."}
{"text":"Love that they offer vegan pizza! We ordered takeout the other night and the service was good and the pizza was delicious. We look forward to eating here again soon."}
{"text":"Crust that is somewhere between a tortilla and pita bread. Soggy. Tasteless. Just plain not good."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great for kids.  Service was quick, helpful, energetic.   The outside deck is a disaster!  Large holes in boards, screws sticking up.  Lawsuit waiting to happen."}
{"text":"First time visiting a MOD Pizza (very disappointed) My pizza hasn't even came out of the oven yet and really felt the need to write a review! This pizza better be amazing with how awful there customer service was. First I walk in there was only 1 person ahead of me and 6 staff members. Not 1 of them welcomed me. (But were happy to say \"have a great night\" to the people leaving. The customer ahead of me seemed to be a 1st time customer as well she, wanted to check everything out and asking lots of questions. (Which was no prob with me) the gal helping her was very attentive. My issue was that there were still 5 more staff members that could have helped me, greeted me, something!!! But no one did. It wasn't until the customer was about to pay someone steps up to take my order. I didn't feel welcomed at all!! I work right by this location and thought I'd give it a try. (should have just stuck with Fired Pie) I hope management takes Customer Care seriously and doesn't let this happen to others."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place for the first time. Wow! One of the best pizzas I've ever had. It's kinda set up like Subway, where you walk through and build your own pizza. I was blown away by the multiple topping selections! Also you can add as many toppings as you like, at no additional charge! I had minced garlic rubbed into my red sauce, mozzarella, spicy Italian sausage, pepperoni red onion, and then added whole roasted garlic cloves and asiago cheese. Then they fire cook it old school style! Also I thought the price was great. $7.47 for an 11\". They also sell 6\" personal size and pizza salads. A salad atop an Asiago pizza crust. Clean place, friendly staff. I will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I've heard of Mod Pizza but today was my first time actually giving it a try at lunch. I walked in and was greeted with a lovely hello from the staff and tons of toppings to choose from. Peter was nice enough to explain the process of building my pizza and helped me down the line with care and no rush. My pizza came out of the oven and he brought it to me with a side sample of their balsamic fig that he suggested. It was delicious! Thank you for a great first experience, I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD!  First time here, and it is so good! The best way to describe MOD Pizza is a fancy Subway, but pizza. You make your own pizza to your liking. Personal size pizza with any toppings you want?! Who wouldn't want that! Even though it is so packed the staff was still very nice.  The only downer is that the seating is horrible. The seating inside was \"family style\" seating, or you were on a stool looking out a window, not too bad, but is was so busy you couldn't hear anything. The outside seating is really large, but the tables are all ready falling apart. The table we sat at needs to be in the trash it was wobbling all over the place.  We can't wait to go back... for carryout! Maybe we will try their fancy salads next time!"}
{"text":"Another great experience at MOD. Once again, the food is great! I love the pizza and salads here! We got a Mod pizza, mini pizza, salad, and drink for 23 dollars. Also, my pizza got given to the wrong person on accident and the GM took care of me right away! Very impressed with how they handled themselves! Also, the rest of the staff is great! We will be back!"}
{"text":"We just came with the whole family (2 adults and 4 preteen/teens) and we had a great experience. We were very impressed by the service and the food and wine/beer quality was great! Our pizza was slightly crispy on the edges and they made us a new one for free! Super nice staff here, we are definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Decided to see what hype is.  Not bad, a wood fired thin crust \"Mad Dog\" with Mushrooms, Onion and Asiago.  I got it to go, so it was only warm by the time I got home, but still tasty.  Customer service is pretty good, just know it's a turnkey environment, so it can take some time; however they still moved product quickly."}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled upon MOD pizza while visiting a strip mall. We went to the shopping complex with the intentions of going to a bookstore, which we found out went out of business. Anyways, that's how we found MOD. This is a cute pizza shop, the decor was modern, with a collage of pictures of staff and customers adorned the walls.  They have the menu plastered on the wall. There are 3 sizes to choose from. There is the 'mini' which is 6\", the MOD which is 11\" and the Mega which is a double 11\" crust. The awesome thing about this place is you can either choose one of their classic pizzas or build your own. You can load your pizza with toppings and there is no extra charge! They charge by size, not toppings. The crust is thin and crispy, just the way I like it. I chose the mini, and picked my own toppings. I chose the pesto sauce, and topped it with chicken, tomatoes and black olives. It was very good! My husband and I ordered a fountain drink to share, but they also have milkshakes, beer and teas. This is a place I will be stopping at again for a pizza fix."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I had lunch here at 1pm since I had never been. What a great concept. I had a mini Olivia (pesto, cheese, tomatoes and topped with balsamic glaze.) Perfect size for one and the pizza was great. I'm really picky about my pizza and will definitely be back.   People complain about the parking but there's plenty of parking as long as you are willing to walk a few more feet. It's really not a big deal."}
{"text":"Get ready to build the pizza of your dreams! They have all the topping and sauce options you could ever want and then some.  A solid choice for when you want a classy pizza, but don't have a ton of time.  Service is super friendly and very fast. They will help you to find the pizza that matches your season.  Just like The Terminator, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"What an amazing concept.  This is the bomb pizza place.  You have all the control on what your pizza will taste like.  Build it your way, or they have suggestions for you.  The people are friendly and helpful.  Great new lunch option, and good for groups who like different things."}
{"text":"Our first visit there was a miscommunication between the guy who made our food and the cashier so we ended up charged double it the food was good.    We returned today during a slower time so we could talk with the manager about the pricing confusion, not only did he tell us the best way to order so we wouldn't be overcharged he made us food on the house too!!    Great customer service and delicious pizza and salads the way you want them!!  We plan to be back often.  My son can't have tomatoes so he can get his own little pizza without sauce - he thinks it's so cool and it doesn't cost us any more than a typical kids meal anywhere else."}
{"text":"Personal pizza place set up like a sub shop. Pick your size and either you can go with any of the styles of pizza they have on the menu or you pick everything out yourself.  You can have any of their toppings, sauces, and cheese on your personal pizza. Staff is friendly and helpful. Once you've paid and get your drink you'll hardly have time to sit before your pizza comes out of their brick style oven.  My favorite is the \"Dillon James\" pizza.  Time to go eat, this review has made me hungry."}
{"text":"One of my favorite new lunch spots.  Great concept for individual pizzas.    Also the lemonades are fantastic."}
{"text":"Located in the part of the shopping plaza near Gander Mountain, MOD Pizza is a neat concept. It's \"Chipotle\" meets pizza, but they don't charge extra for the \"guacamole.\" Yes, they have a handful of set pizzas on the menu board but as they move your pie along the assembly line, you can add as many toppings as you like. No extra charges!  I looked over the menu board and settled on the \"Season's Mod\" which had roasted Brussels Sprouts, red onions, gorgonzola and a balsamic glaze. And while that probably would have been enough, I also took the recommendation of one of the Mod Squad and added chicken. Good idea!  A few minutes later, my name was shouted and I stepped up to pick up my pie. Sliced into four neat quarters, the thin crust pizza base was nice and crunchy. Plenty of toppings and it tasted absolutely amazing. Full of great flavors. Very enjoyable.  Neat vibe in this fast casual restaurant. It's not a date night place, more the sort that you can bring the whole family."}
{"text":"Really like the concept of this place. Cheap (or what I would call cheap) personal pizzas for about 8 bucks and unlimited toppings. Staff is always super friendly and pizza tastes great."}
{"text":"Good quality for the price.  The employees are ALWAYS friendly and helpful. I'm kinda picky about my Hawaiian pizza and they just smile and do it.  It's always clean and stocked.  I eat there for lunch often but my dog fundraising committee meets there once a month. We're always there until closing but they never rush us. It's always colder than hell in there because of the pizza oven but I've learned to bring a sweater or eat outside.  It's worth it for the food and people."}
{"text":"The best experience in a get it and go kind of restaurant.  Fresh ingredients and awesome music.  You get a personal pizza you customize and it was beyond words amazing. It was cheap too!!  They have Spotted Cow on tap which is even more of a reason to enjoy a piece of pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza, create your own or pick from one of theirs! Never thought I would like asparagus on a pizza but it's awesome!"}
{"text":"So glad we stopped in here instead of hitting Cafe Zupa where we're annoyed at the theatrical customer service clerks always responding with \"Perfect!\" after everything you say or always upselling.  The pizza here is AMAZING! Excellent crust, sauce and any combo of toppings you like without paying extra. Their brick oven cooks the crust to a crisp bubbly perfection. Great staff! Very good salads as well. Everything is super fresh.  Gotta be careful though since their \"no name\" chocolate mini ding dong like cakes are insanely addicting and fresh! YUM!"}
{"text":"The pizza is good but not great. Lots of toppings to choose from but no onion other than red? The f...??? It was inexpensive and quick. I felt like the sauce needs a little more flavor. I would come back if I was looking for a quick pizza fix. It was better than fired pie, but not as good as blaze pizza."}
{"text":"They make wonderful pizzas to your order. The line can get a little long during meal times but that is expected. If you tell them you are vegetarian they all change their gloves and cut the pizza with a different slicer. I appreciate that. I wish they had a better drink selection. All the teas have sugar and there is only water as an alternative."}
{"text":"Pizza made to order. I don't always like thin crust pizza, but the crust here is light like a cracker and still flavorful. There are so many toppings to choose from. You can chose as many as you want all for the same price.   The Marion Berry Lemonade and Caramelized Pear Iced Tea are amazing with free refills.   The staff is also super friendly."}
{"text":"I've tried a few other pizza places like this and MOD did not disappoint. Amazing pizza at a great price...what more can you ask for? I was also really impressed that the girl helping us spelled my name correctly without me telling her how. That's never happened! Go here. Eat some pizza and try the lemonade. It's fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great pizzas, made quick! You choose your own toppings and add as many as you'd like. Lots of choices on the toppings.   Friendly staff who are helpful.   They have great sauces to finish that you are able to get on the side. They also offer pesto or garlic to add to the red sauce.   Teas and lemonades are also delicious"}
{"text":"It's all on the flavor. But you knew that. Unfortunately at MOD Pizza,they don't.   THE SAUCE IS DEAD. YOU CANT TASTE IT, I CANT TASTE IT. IT KILLS THE WHOLE PIZZA!    Pizza looks good. It's right-priced. But since the sauce is dead -- no flavor-- it kills the whole pizza, stop, check please!  MOD: Made on Demand- get a better sauce and I'll come back. Until then, taste Pizza Studio, see what I mean."}
{"text":"Kids made their own individual salad and I made an awesome salad!!!  A ton of toppings for both salad and pizza bit my rating is for the salad."}
{"text":"We came in after church on a Sunday afternoon. Its the same concept as Pieology, make your own pizza to order. Choose the pre-suggested pizzas or make your own selections. My kids were excited to choose their own crazy wishes and when it came to me I choose the same way. I didnt see an option for gluten-free pizza crust but we were distracted cuz of the amount of choices. They have racks on the wall of premade pizza dough, smaller 4-sliced for the kids and larger 4-sliced for adults. I choose my sauce, toppings and the creation went into the large pizza oven. Our friends ordered a pre-suggested pizza and unfortunately, the young man and middle aged lady didnt remember all the toppings that went with that specific pizza. I could hear the guy reading off the list to the lady who was making it. Kinda tacky guys! Also, they asked our name for the pizzas and they heard something completely different. Like if it was supposed to be Jeff she wrote Barb on it. I tried to correct her and she said \"oh, thats ok\". Right. Then why ask my name? The pizza was quick to cook and had a good flavor. I had alot of toppings fall off my pizza but it really didnt look very loaded. Strange. They have a nice patio and the place feels comfy. I'm not sure I'll come back. I'd be concerned they forgot to refrigerate something properly or wash their hands. Just saying."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious With lots of choices Great staff  Pizza with salad as a Topping is ingenious  Can't wait to return :)"}
{"text":"so i always seek out new places to eat in the city so i spent some time on the computer looking for places to visit on my lunch break. i stumbled across mod and im glad i did. i love the pizza, love that its set up almost cafeteria style, and love that you can pile on as much toppings as you want FREE OF CHARGE. i got the Tyler. and it was delish. when i go back i wanna try the white pizza's, yes.... when o go back. because i plan to. One bad thing was the staff, hot and cold. some were super friendly, some didn't wanna be there. lol"}
{"text":"The pizza is always good when I come here the only downside to this place are the grumpy unfriendly employees, customer service is just bad."}
{"text":"Best pizza I had in a long time. People are friendly and their no name cake is amazing."}
{"text":"Most everyone was friendly and helpful, especially Kai! Delicious as always! We are greeted right when we arrived and the line was quick."}
{"text":"Good food, good service but the employees should get dressed at home not in the dining room with wrinkled shirt out of the backpack and try to wash it every so often.  Crew was busier trying to stay out of work than helping people.  Will go in a few weeks and see if things improve. Ordered a salad and was told I could only get 4 additional items, 1 guy doing the pizza an salads, young lady running around very busy but too busy to help out front."}
{"text":"In short, this place is the Moe's of pizzadom. You walk in, stand in line pick large or small, thin or thick crust and a cornucopia of toppings. The food was well worth the price, quality was better than good, and portions were perfect. The only gripe is the atmosphere. The restaurant as a whole has taken the minimalist approach to dining. Otherwise this is my new favorite pizza in the area. Good job MOD, I will return."}
{"text":"I like that you get to pick your own toppings at this place, but the pizza is real soggy in the center which I'm not a fan of. I asked them to cook it extra crispy but it didn't really do the job. The employees were extremely nice and helpful and the location is clean."}
{"text":"So on the advice of a classmate, I suggested to my buddy that we make this our lunchtime spot.   Since I can't have anything too large to eat, I was really excited to see the mini version on the menu.  The employees tending the line were nice but didn't seem enthusiastic about what they were doing.   I ordered a mini with red/pesto mix sauce, cheese, crumbled meatballs, olives, mushrooms and onion (they had raw red onion) and asked for a little extra cheese on top.   Our names were called out in a timely manner, but then it went downhill from there. I wondered if they just had no clue on the oven temps or if the time they needed to be in wasn't calculated for a mini. Why?  Because my pizza came out with a VERY sad charcoal crust. The toppings and cheese were not bad but eating this burnt disc was more than even my appetite could overcome.   The premise of these places are fantastic but in this case, they far fall below Fired Pie's usual standard.  Maybe someday I will give it another chance but for now: 3 stars for decent staff, decent topping choices and having a smaller version."}
{"text":"Very solid choice for pizza. I say \"f*** Domino's and Pizza Hut\" I will never eat there again because of this place... i've pretty much become a mod addict I think in the last two weeks I've been here like eight times... The mozzarella here is the bees knees, not to mention the crust being absolutely amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to a few if these one price pizza places where you build your own. They are all very similar in my opinion. This one is a bit better. The crust tastes more like real pizza dough as opposed to a super thin cracker like crust i have had at the other places.  The dough is thin but not cracker thin. I like the topping choices and they had some nice fresh herbs I don't see at the other places like fresh rosemary.  Prices are good. Comparable with other places like this. Unlike some other places they offered a finishing drizzle. I had a pesto pizza and they suggested a balsamic fig drizzle. It was quite good. I would definetly go back again. Good for kids they also do a small 6 inch pizza too."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot! This place is much better than the other build-your-own-pie franchises I have tried.   The crust on the pizza is always my main concern and they manage to maintain its crispness for the amount of toppings I order. The \"Deluxe\" salad is awesome, too!   Friendly service. Love taking my nieces and nephews here. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is simply because the sauce is underwhelming. However, it's still good enough to make me a returning customer!"}
{"text":"MOD pizza is happiness in a box. Especially if you are a picky pizza person like muah. I like it thin and crispy yet packed with flavor. The great thing about MOD is that YOU are responsible for making an amazing pizza because you pick what you want on it. So if you didn't like it, it's your own darn fault. You should have said no pineapple. But you had to put them on didn't you because you wanted to have ALL the effin toppings on there didn't you. Darn you Bridget, you did it again!   I have said eaten 4 times here and haven't had the same pizza because there is so many ways you can customize it to your own unique taste. Did I mention that you can have both the red MOD sauce AND the white sauce. YES you can. DO IT!! It's sooooo good. I love you MOD. I appreciate you being just an 10 minute drive away. Don't forget to check out the delicious mouth watering concoctions I have made in the photos. See you at MOD. I'll be that girl stuffing her face in the corner."}
{"text":"For $7.47, the MOD size pizza is the perfect size to split for lunch.  It's just enough food to make you feel full but not enough to make you feel gross.  That's important because when left alone with pizzas of larger sizes, I'm known to make bad decisions.  You're probably like me in that regard.  Portion control at it's finest here.    While the price is right and the food is tasty, I'm still steaming about waiting in line for 25 minutes to order (plus another 8-10 to get my food).  Their business model is fast pizzas but this was anything but.  I'm sure it's the new employees getting used to the way things go but there was no sense of urgency at all.  I heard at least 3 people in line say something along the lines of \"Fired Pie is so much faster.\"    I'll be back for the aforementioned price and pizza but if that line is more than 6 deep, I'm walking."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, great concept. Brian came to check on us to see how everything was and while he was standing nearby, my sister announced she is expecting. We were all ecstatic for her, of course, including Brian. He brought free milkshakes to my sister, myself and my sister-in-law (we're all expecting) and gave us vouchers for free pizza. Great customer service, great place to eat. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"This location puts out great pizza.  This pizza place is similar to all the other chains that offer build your own brick oven cooked pizza.  I think that the price is better at MOD Pizza than other comparable places, though.  As with all of the places, because the crust is so thin it is better not to pile on as many toppings as you can just BECAUSE you can because you will end up with a floppy, impossible to eat pizza.  Anyhow, try it for yourself, you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!  Get as much toppings as you want on the pizza for one low price! As both of my kids like to pick there own toppings it was really fun for them.  There was a line pretty much to the door but the staff was great and took the time to listen to what you wanted - literally I asked for chicken and then more chicken and then more chicken on mine LOL.  I ended up ordering a glass of wine and honestly would refrain from doing that again as it is the low quality wine and when asking about the types of wine none of the staff had any idea what to tell me as nobody drank wine.  My fiance and son got a milkshake and it was delicious.  Did have to wait for the food, about 20 minutes or so but it was great, also remember to ask for the glaze as an extra sauce it was great as a glaze on the pizza :)"}
{"text":"This place is brand new in the neighborhood so we tried it out !  The facility was clean. But again it's brand new so I will have to check back again!  The food was good we ordered a chicken Cesar salad pizza . The staff seemed unfamiliar with it or just confused by it but at the end it was made correctly!   We prefer a little more dressing so we always ask for extra.   The staff was friendly and besides seeming a bit off about chicken Cesar salad on a pizza were polite and fast!   It's set up is like a cross between subway and papa Murphy's for food preparation.   The open flame oven is pretty cool !   Not my favorite pizza place but good enough to go back too!  Hopefully we can try more menu items next time !"}
{"text":"I think my girlfriend and I really should stay away from these types of places.  We both love pizza and eat it quite regularly. In fact, next to eating pizza, I also enjoy listening to people talk about various places around the city that make it exceptionally well. But ultimately, I just don't think that we're the type of crowd that MOD is catering to.  Maybe if I had to feed a family of finicky kids, where little Tristin doesn't like sausage and sweet Kaitlyn is allergic to peppers, I'd be all over it. Meanwhile, I can drown three different sauces and a dozen different meats onto my own personal pizza, while still paying less than fifty bucks to feed a family of five. Great!    . . . Except I don't need to feed a family of five.    MOD Pizzeria, despite being one of the first \"Chipotle-style\" pizza joints that I can recall, doesn't really offer anything more or less than any one of its 50 carbon-copy businesses that have since clogged the city.    Yes, some are admittedly better than others when it comes to preparation, ingredients, or crust quality. But ultimately, in the end, they're all basically the same damned thing: pizza that's just a hair better than your big-time national chains - which is apparently all it takes to convince other people that they're eating something truly incredible.  I've said it time and time again. No amount of friendly service, fast preparation, freshness, or sleek décor is going to fool me into thinking your food is good. If your pizza sucks, your pizza sucks - period.     I decided to order the Maddy, which is essentially just cheese and tomato sauce. When done properly, a basic margherita-like pie can be an incredible thing. Piling on toppings is irrelevant if the core of the pizza lacks flavor. Fortunately, I knew this wasn't the place to pull off a standard margherita, so I added some pepperoni and Canadian bacon to liven it up.  My girlfriend ordered a pizza called the Tyler, but requested that they avoid the BBQ sauce. It was more of a traditional cheese/tomato pizza with pepperoni, ham, and pineapple.  All it took was one bite. We knew that we made a mistake and instantly debated on who would take the blame. While I recently compared Fired Pie to a high-end frozen pizza (not in a bad way), I'd put MOD more on par with something in the bargain section that I'd consume during my poor college days. It's really no different than anything I could obtain at a gas station - and yes, believe it or not, gas station pizza is not below me during times of intense hunger.  Ultimately, I feel that I really should stop going to these places thinking that I'm going to strike gold. Pizza is, was, and will always be my favorite food. But after discovering its true potential in recent years, I see these places as nothing more than wasted space.  Deep down, since the kids preparing the food were all friendly, I'd feel guilty giving them a single star. But my God, after reading some of these reviews, I'm starting to realize that Yelpers really don't get out much.  Not recommended."}
{"text":"Mini with red sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, basil, roasted garlic, mushroom, black olive, roasted red pepper, gorgonzola and with balsamic fig(?) glaze, crushed red pepper and parmesan. Just a really good selection of toppings to help you create your perfect individual pizza. There's not a limit, you could too you pizza with everything for the same price. Beer and wine on tap in addition to fountain sodas and their own blend of brewed iced tea or lemonade. I've tried a couple other small pizza places around town and this one ranks high for price, selection and flavor."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place wonderful staff very kind and helpful and the fact that you pay for the size only and all ingredients are unlimited and free just makes it all that better. Delicious ingredients and clean environment, do yourself a favor and hit up Mod Pizza"}
{"text":"We decided to try this after running a few errands. The staff was super sweet!! And the idea of unlimited free toppings at a pizza place is nuts!! They even sell carafes Of wine - I'm sold! Will be back :)"}
{"text":"They had very little topping choices compared to other joints like this. Also my boyfriends pizza was so burnt he couldn't eat more than half of it."}
{"text":"Really liked it and very reasonably priced.  Each of the kids had their own pepperoni pizzas and I took a little adventure.  At first it seemed like a little bit of sauce, but the end result was perfect.  It's a thin crust, which normally the kids don't eat, but they raved about it and thought it was so good and crunch and then soft in the middle.  Would definitely try this place again.  The location is next to Kneaders and Chipotle plaza off the 101.  They also had some teas and lemonade that seemed like interesting mixes, but I didn't try any of them."}
{"text":"Holy cow! We waited over 30 minutes  to get through line and receive our pizza. Then they never called my name for my pizza. I had to walk up and ask if it was ready. There it was sitting there getting cold. I know I didn't miss my name, I was sitting right next to the counter. To top it off, the damn thing was burnt. I understand brick oven pizza gets hot spots, but this was scorched. They never cut it into slices. To top it off I never  got a receipt offered to me. The staff seemed overwhelmed and confused. Probably not going back."}
{"text":"Both the pizzas and salads are great.  Be careful not to go on a Friday night because you may be in line for a while.  The workers have always been nice.  You get a lot for your money and it is something everyone in my family can agree on."}
{"text":"I don't love or hate Mod as far as build-your-own-pizzas go. They offer gluten free crusts, but there's little protection against cross contamination, so beware of that.  The topping selection is basic, but they don't put a lot of toppings unless you ask.   They have a good drink selection with flavored teas, which is unique to these types of places."}
{"text":"This place is great! Unlike fired pie, Blaze or 1000 degrees, they have a small personal size as well as a larger 6 slice pizza. I come here because of that more than any other reason. Unlimited topping personal pizzas UNDER 5$!!!  It's crazy that you can't get a true personal size pizza like this in most of these new make your own pizza joints.  Quality is great and consistent. Veggies are always crisp and meats fresh. Their $5 pitcher during happy hour is the best beer value in town! Service has always been friendly and fast. Great place to take kids too!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! I found the build your own pizza to be the best deal. There is a great selection of sauces and toppings. The only negatives,  are that the line and subsequent cooking time, can produce over a ten minute wait when it's busy. The pizza crust gets a little sorry, if you really lad the toppings, too. Also, the fountain drink selection is lacking. Although, the flavored iced tea and lemonade are a plus!"}
{"text":"We checked it out because we had a coupon for a free pizza. It was at lunch time and they were totally busy. The pizza making process went really fast and they had tons of toppings to choose from. When the pizzas came out of the oven it was a different story though. It seemed like the person that was supposed to call out the pizzas was slammed with orders and not sure which went where. It did not help that the leader, perhaps the manager was yelling at him. It made it really awkward. I felt bad and that is the only reason why I cant give 5 stars. I will be back and I hope that there is more team work for the people working their totally adds the the atmosphere. The pizza was great! I had #4 and it was totally delicious. I love that they had mini pizzas for kids too. They overcooked the garlic bread we had but gave us another one because of it without us saying anything. I also totally enjoyed their delicious lemonades!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place.  I'm usually there on Friday and Saturday nights. April, the Manager kicks butt. There's usually about 3 staff members and she still manages to keep the place running smoothly, even when the place is packed.  Food comes out super fast and my pizza is always cooked  to perfection!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever!!! Yummy fresh ingredients, make your own, portion sizes are perfect. Staff is amazing and I'm going back again today for lunch. I'm on a program and their calorie content fits right in!!  Have fun with it!! Yay MOD"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. They have the best pizza in town and I appreciate their gluten free options.  The employees are so sweet, kind and helpful.  Randy, the manager went over and above to let my twin boys know they were kind and \"cool\".  He is a great guy.  My family and I can't say enough .. they really are awesome."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, but not excellent. Perhaps I had too high of expectations, but I was hoping for something better. The crust was good, the pizzas are a good size, but I don't think the cheeses or the meats are very high quality. Not terrible, mind you, but not good enough that they can stand on their own without a bunch of other toppings for flavor.   Even so, for the price, I would say they are definitely worth trying out. They have good happy hour prices on beer Mon-Fri from 6-8. I would come back for that for sure."}
{"text":"The pizza is better than the star rating.  It would have been more stars if \"red hat\" guy wouldn't have made us feel like we were wasting his time.   As \"Mod Virgins\", we didn't know what to expect, but as we entered the line, we were greeted by a friendly lady who took the time to explain how things worked and made excellent suggestions.  Very good so far, would have been a 5 star rating for her...then the \"villain in the red hat\" took over for the vegetable toppings...WOW what a dramatic change.  Totally made us feel like we had no business being there...Didn't get much better with the cashier.  That lady couldn't hardly take the time to take our money, didn't explain that we needed to stick around to hear our name called, but didn't exude hate like the \"red hat\" guy.  Both were polar opposite from our sauce, and protein topping lady....  We chose to sit outside, waited for our name to be called...never happened.  Went in to check on the pizza and there it was chilling out all by itself on the counter.  Wonder why the staff didn't think to check outside on such a nice day???  Oh, I forgot...they didn't care!  Too bad, because the pizza is good!  Maybe we were not the only people left feeling unwelcome as they weren't busy even though it was the heart of the lunch hour. Training -Training-Training...yes it does make a difference to some customers!"}
{"text":"Pizza is great, salad is fresh and hearty.  Both are made to order.  Service is good.  I've been there three times already and consistently good.  BIG bonus having your Memorial Day special."}
{"text":"***Update***  I initially invited my family here when it first opened and wasn't too happy. Yesterday I went back to try it again and was VERY pleased!  The pizza was cooked just right...toasted on the bottom but soft on the inside.  The flavors were defined and scrumptious, just like I remember it in Seattle   Definitely recommend to anyone wanting tasty pizza that's affordable and done quick!"}
{"text":"I've tried different locations, one on Warner and cooper and the other on Elliot and 101. Both were disappointing. I see no value to these pizzas. The one I received at the Elliot location the crust was burned. Which made the toppings leave a bad taste in my mouth. When i brought itup to the server she stated ots because its gluten free and walked away. I call BS.  The Warner location had such a long wait time it was ridiculous.  I can appreciate longer wait times if it's a busy Friday night, but it was not busy, may six people in there.  Very disappointing. So I WONT go back a third time."}
{"text":"Update: Went a second time. We ordered online and our stuff was ready right on time. Great!  In addition to pizza, we had salad this time. The salads were good, but they forgot the dressing on mine, it was totally dry and I didn't notice until I got home. Nobody wants a dry salad. Some ingredients are a lot less ok than others to forget.   It's like if you find yourself making a pizza with no sauce or cheese. It's worth a double check of the order ticket to make sure, \"hey man, is this right?\".   If you want to chime in and say that dry salads are normal and you like them, NO you are a weirdo.  Also, they do the uber friendly thing, that's popular with fast casual food and coffee lately: where every single member of the crew says hello to you when you walk in, some of them visibly busy but having to stop what they're doing to look at you to say hi. It's very obvious that it's a mandated behavior, and I find it creepy. I wish it were acceptable/polite for me to waive that courtesy by walking in and immediately shouting \"shut the fuck up!\", but they'd probably think they were being robbed.  The pizzas were great."}
{"text":"Great pizza for a great price! 11\" thin crust pizza with as many toppings as you desire! Seriously, how can you go wrong? The toppings are fresh and the pizza is put together/baked right in front of you in a Chipotle-esque way. They also have some delicious fresh-made lemonade and iced tea.  I've heard it can get busy during the lunch hour so be sure to get there early. If you heed this warning, your pizza will be ready in about 5-10 minutes. If you don't, prepare for a longer wait.  The only thing I don't like is the skimping on the toppings. Seriously, if you're going to advertise \"as much toppings as you want\" I shouldn't have to ask 3 times for extra cheese/sauce in order to make it an appropriate amount.   Overall, MOD is a great pizza spot and I will be back many times in the near future."}
{"text":"Delicious food. I frequent this place now once a week. 3 different sizes of personal pizzas or salads made your way to order. Love that you can put as many or as little toppings in as you want. Roasted tomatoes, Artichokes, & Feta on your pizza! Yum!! Service is always great, too. Love this place. Very modern, hip feel. Family friendly."}
{"text":"What a great value! Gluten Free, no problem. Non dairy, no problem. Staff was super friendly, even noticed my USAA credit card and gave us a military discount! The boys are moaning around that they ate too much, don't hear that too often!  We have a new favorite pizza joint. Much better than the Nook.  They also have a super nice patio with outdoor seating."}
{"text":"The pizza wasn't bad and it was quick and cheap. Unlimited amount of toppings is a nice feature. If I was in the mood for pizza I would probably pick someplace else, but if I wanted pizza fast this would be fine. Very good for what it is; fast pizza. The garlic strips were good but tasted like Rosemary instead of garlic."}
{"text":"This place is unique....3 different sizes, 3 different flat prices. It's that easy. Put whatever and how much of whatever on it and pay at the front. Every now and again, I feel the pizza should be in the oven a bit longer, as I get the mega size (with double layers of cheese and crust). I'm sure they would put it back in the oven if I asked them too, but it was so good anyway that I was quite satisfied. Honestly, you can't beat the price. You can basically get all the food you want, all the cheese you want, and all the sauce you want for a flat price. Try this place out, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Brought the family, and everyone was satisfied-- even me! Great choices for building your own pizza from gluten free to meat lovers kind of pizza. We're coming back also very fast service!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this gem tonight for take-out. Why have we never been here?! The pizza was crispy, the sauce was flavorful and the toppings plentiful! The staff were all very friendly, and welcomed us on our first visit. They walked us through how it all works and were very patient as I stood there oooh'ing and ahhhh'ing over all of the wonderful toppings. We both devoured our own pizzas and both agreed that we loved the pizzas."}
{"text":"This is the 4th time we have been here and it never disappoints. I don't eat cheese and love the fact I can pile on the veggies at no extra charge here. I had the 11inch create your own with chicken and bacon and as many veggies as could fit. Their jalapeños are actually spicy which we love and don't forget to add the spicy buffalo sauce behind the counter! Definitely ups the kick!  My kids each had their own 6 inch one with pepperoni and the other with sausage. We all ate for $18 and were satisfied and no one had to compromise toppings. We will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza BUT tonight ordered online. Came in to no one there and they had t even stated my pizza. Another patron after me had the same experience. They just said sorry. So why were you just standing around for 10 mins after I called???"}
{"text":"Not from the state, but wanted to check out something new in area. MOD pizza popped up so we decided to give it a whirl. Was super fast, easy and convenient. They don't charge per topping, just the size of the pizza, so that was awesome. Loaded that pie up, had it cooked to perfection, took it home and loved every bite. Staff was super friendly and helpful. If we lived near, we'd probably be coming weekly. Give it a go if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Here's the thing about MOD Pie...As long as they don't over or undercook it..it's all about your ability to construct a pie to your liking. They don't have every topping ever used on a pizza, but what's there is fresh and of high quality. I love the concept of a personal pizza that is cooked in a brick oven and only takes 5 minutes to serve and MOD Pizza gets it done."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited recently and were quite impressed. I ordered the Dillon James ($7.87) on gluten-free crust (2.00 xtra) and added additional toppings without any additional cost (chicken & mushrooms). The pizza was delivered to our table in a speedy fashion. Crisp crust and cooked perfectly. My only suggestion would be to cut the slices smaller as they are cut quite huge right now. Otherwise, it tasted perfectly and was quite filling. The MOD size pizza is large enough to serve 2 people or one really hungry person. I'm glad to have an additional gluten-friendly dining choice nearby."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! Quick and delicious! Huge selection of wonderful toppings! Had a MODified version of the Calexico -  mozzarella,  gorgonzola,  jalapeño and chorizo with a buffalo sauce drizzle.  Damn good! Paired it with the Marion Blackberry Lemonade....  Mmmmm.  I'm definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch the atmosphere was nice the staff was friendly. You basically create your own pizza they have fresh toppings and I made a pepperoni and roasted broccoli pizza. I would recommend, it was a bit pricey but it tasted delicious. Will give back again."}
{"text":"Unlimited toppings!!! I got the #2, and you can add however many toppings you want for no extra charge. Love that they have chorizo too.   The staff is still a bit frantic, but the place opened last week so it's understandable. Everyone is really nice and the patio should be great in the winter."}
{"text":"Food is Awesome , service is fast and friendly and affordable too. Great concept . I highly recommend this for any occasion."}
{"text":"Pizza tasted like tortillas covered in toppings and the garlic slices were so dry. This was my valentine's meal and I was very disappointed. Sticking with nypd next time"}
{"text":"This was the first trip for me.  I loved my meal!! The service was really what blew me away. The three of us each ordered a mini and when they called us, they said my daughter's had gotten a bit more done than they apparently prefer. The said they had already started another but gave us the original to get started on. It was only slightly burnt on the edges. No more than the rest but I was impressed at the attention to detail and pride in product that the staff showed. Definitely recommend. Plus wine on tap!"}
{"text":"Excellent choices, price and taste as fast as it gets. I am always greeted when I walk in the door  by friendly staff. The best part is unlimited toppings for the same price. I don't have to keep asking for more like some other build your own places. I highly recommend MOD!"}
{"text":"This place is so cool! Think of it like Chipotle for pizza lovers. Everyone gets their own personal pie. You point to the ingredients behind the glass, they cook your pizza in 6-8 minutes, done! Staff is amazing too.   Been there twice. I am a fan."}
{"text":"Loved the pizza and the crew. The garlic strip and dip was great too. I tried it for the first time yesterday and got to say that the crew was very very friendly. They even helped out with carrying the pizzas to the table coz they were more than two hands can carry. My 3 hrs old ate it all by herself and even tapped me on my hand when I tried to eat own of her pizza slides. Overall q great eating place, will go again and recommended to all."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp....what a gem! The girl at the counter asked right away if we had been to MOD before, we said no and she waved us over. She explained they charge based on the size of the pizza only and unlimited toppings...what?! Great concept! The staff are amazing and the food is so delicious especially at such a reasonable price."}
{"text":"My dine-in lunch experience was very good. My 11\" custom-built pizza was ready in about six minutes, and had plenty of fresh toppings with a delicious thin crust. There were several unique drink options available. Also, the dining room was clean, with nice background music."}
{"text":"Odd place. The pizza wasn't bad, but they did forget my basil, worse the seating is extremely uncomfortable."}
{"text":"It's not often that I give a chain restaurant a 5-star review but this place truly deserves it.  This is a custom pizza (or salad) joint sort of on the lines of chipotle. You choose a base option from their menu or design your own. They have a line that adds whatever toppings you want. Additional toppings for your pizza do not cost extra! Yay! But your options are pretty basic, standard pizza toppings with a few odd ball ones thrown in.  Ater your pizza is made, it is sent to the oven and this is not your conveyer belt oven like some other pizza chains use. This is a gas fired oven where your pizza is monitored by an attendant.   For drinks, they have your typical tea and soda but also offer lemonade, craft beer and a few other specialty drinks.  Service is where this place shines. You are greeted as you walk in the door and everyone is friendly and helpful. On my most recent trip, they noticed something wrong with my coworker's pizza and put it back in the oven and offered him some garlic sticks while he waited. Then they brought the pizza out to him.  Their pizzas taste great. They have a flavorful red sauce. But I would skip the garlic sticks. They were a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm gonna say it - I like this place more than a certain other build-it-yourself pizza place down the road. It's bigger, with a nice atmosphere and more room for people waiting in line. Super friendly staff. There's a good amount of seating. The pizza crust is thin but not too dry or crunchy, probably my favorite part. Mod has a huge menu (but really you could probably just walk up and say what sauce you wanted with your toppings) and I really appreciate them posting the calories next to each pizza type. Pricing: I think I paid $10 for pizza and a non-alcoholic drink. I only ate half the pizza, so now I have lunch for tomorrow and it became two meals for me, not bad."}
{"text":"Second trip to MOD, this place rocks!  Walk in the door and you're greeted with practically a high-five!  Each time you're here, it's like your first time, but also like you've known these guys forever.  I can't stress enough the hospitality of everyone working here.  Off the charts!  The pizza here is great as well!  Pick your toppings, anything you want, all the same price!  Looking for something more healthy?  How about a salad?  One of my new favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine bought me one of their pizzas several years back, from a different location. It was a pretty good little pie. Way too much money for the size, but good."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised by MOD Pizza. At first, I was a bit skeptical about how good it would be and also fairly hesitant at the idea of having a personal pizza as a meal. But, after trying out one of the pizzas from their menu, a custom pizza, and their plain cheese pizza, I can say that I really enjoy this place. The quality is good, the customization options are even better if you're eating in a group, and the atmosphere is great. All the pizzas I've tried have been filling but not overly heavy, and they've all been tasty. Fair warning to the pizza fanatics out there though that this isn't going to be quite like your favorite slice; it's basically what Chipotle is to your favorite Mexican place. Still, I think it's worth it if you're thinking about giving this place a try."}
{"text":"My husband likes this pizza place and it's been okay.  But about every other time I order the Phoenix pizza, they totally botch it up.  The last time, which was earlier this week, I'm not even sure what pizza I got, but it wasn't what I ordered.  They did offer to make me another pizza, any pizza, but the point of takeout is you're trying to save time.  I had my son go in and pickup our order and he didn't know what my pizza looked like, though I should have given him a picture.  I had ordered this pizza with bacon, too.  No bacon.  The manager seemed indifferent, oh, I guess the pizza person forgot the bacon.  No real apology there.  Customizing an order means you want it different.  I didn't want to drive back there as I was already home and we were about to have dinner, except me.  The pizza didn't look like the other Phoenix pizzas I ordered and I think they forgot more than just the custom bacon, rather other things, too.  They keep messing this order up and about every other time, they do mess up our pizza orders.  I may give this place one more chance as we've already given quite a few chances.  But they aren't really getting better and staying the same.  I'm sure there are probably other pizza places nearby that have good pizza that can get the orders right.  For me, I would give this place 2 stars, but my husband likes this place and thus I bumped it up a star for him."}
{"text":"Another good option for my keto pals out there.  Pick a salad and add any keto friendly toppings you need!  Not going to the the fanciest most gourmet food, but for a quick meal you can't beat the price.  Also fantastic for kiddos, they love to pick their own toppings and watch it get made in front of them.  For a picky toddler this is a sure bet."}
{"text":"Well this is my first time going to this place and its no wonder why they have 5 stars. Awesome service with our big work group! My pizza The \"Calexico\" with artichokes was perfect. Nice crust and great sauce.   Nobody in our group of ten had complaints, especially when the manager/brick oven god came to our tables with tasty cinnamon sticks and garlic bread on the house!   Good job and keep it up! Ill be back for more!"}
{"text":"Great pizza fast. Lots of fresh topping to choose from and the thin crust means the pizza cooks fast. Service was good. Lots of parking and places to sit."}
{"text":"Mod pizza is always an excellent, fast and inexpensive pizza place. I always get the Sophie pizza. It's nice to be able to add what ever toppings you want without being charged extra. Pizza is fresh and made quick."}
{"text":"This is a go to lunch spot. Pizzas and service is good every time. Can get crowded during lunch sometimes. Got a ceaser salad this time and it's great."}
{"text":"MOD is an incredible find. Build your own pizza with so much more than the normal toppings. The service was absolutely amazing.  This is a must visit. My niece said, \"This is the best pizza I've ever had. \""}
{"text":"Disappointed, Pizza was like cardboard. Had to beg for enough cheese and sauce to cover pizza.... Salad was good. Will not return!!"}
{"text":"Nice pizza place for a quick bite. It's not much different from Fired Pie or Blaze Pizza which is also nearby.  Chose a pizza and put whatever toppings you want on it. They make it quickly and you eat it. I haven't decided which of the quick pizza places are my favorite yet."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and ordered the gluten free pizza. When I arrived they forgot to put my order in. They immediately gave us drinks while we waited. After not putting croutons on the side for me, Nathaniel told me my entire meal was taken care of. This is great customer service. I was not  expecting such nice people at this place! It was clean and well run. My pizza was the bomb!!"}
{"text":"I had to stop at Ace Hardware in Gilbert and saw Mod next to Starbucks. I was feeling a little famished so I stopped in and I'm so glad I did! It was great tasting pie! Love the thin crispy crust!"}
{"text":"Great job Nick and gang awesome as always and the orange blossom ale pairs amazing with the pizza"}
{"text":"Really good food.  this location hit a home run, super service.  Clean shop, very fast.  You will find a great experience here. Their crust is very thin, they have the cook time perfect. Try it!"}
{"text":"Just made our first trip to MOD Pizza... It was fantastic! It's got a great atmosphere, industrial feel, with great service and the pizza was delicious.  The staff is friendly and enthusiastic. It was pretty busy on Saturday afternoon, but that's to be expected with a restaurant that just opened and is getting great reviews....it was worth it. It was packed!  You can basically create any pizza you can imagine with all of the toppings/combinations to choose from.....and they have beer :) Check this place out and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza for a cheap price. If you don't like the pizza then you don't know how to build one lol."}
{"text":"This place is super cool! Create your own pizza is a great idea and I love that if you ask for suggestions they can help. The food is very fresh and it is reasonably priced! Perfect for a late work night when I don't feel like cooking! I love that I can have a beer while I wait for my pizza to come out of the oven too! Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Really great and flavorful pizza for a fast casual pizza place. I got the pizza salad and it was absolutely gigantic and everything tasted very fresh. The store was very clean and the employees were really fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge pizza person, but during my lunch break I decided to check it out andddd it was amazing. I had the buffalo chicken pizza slice (can't remember the exact name of the pizza) it was hot, fresh, and full of flavor"}
{"text":"Having been to other pizza places like this I would have to rate this at a 3. I felt their toppings to be limited and their pizza makers to be stingy on the cheese."}
{"text":"Excellent, love the pizza. Tons of toppings to choose from. Very quick and the price is perfect. Super friendly staff"}
{"text":"Pizza is decent assuming you get it within a reasonable time and it's not burnt.        My fiancé and I have gone once before on a Tuesday afternoon (4pm), the place was empty so we were able to be attended quickly and receive our food within 15 minutes. Food was decent and the service wasn't good but it wasn't abysmal either.  We went on a Friday (~6:30pm) there was a line and the service was horrible. We waited almost 30 minutes for our food which to our surprise had burnt. We spoke with the employees about our wait and they promised they would start our order again immediately. Another 15 minutes pass by and we see other people order and receive their food before us. They had placed our order last in line behind the customers that had arrived after us. By the time we complained they were barely putting finishing one pizza and setting the other one together.   The absolute worst part of it was having to argue with the manager. I asked for a refund and she only wanted to refund me one pizza although they had already messed up the order and I hadn't even taken a bit of the pizza she claimed \"was what I asked for\". I received the refunds for the pizzas, eventually, but not for the two sodas that we ordered. Now we did drink the sodas but I am a believer that if an establishment like that messes up so royally, it is up to them to make up for their mistakes.  The employees seemed to want to just hang out vs actually help customers."}
{"text":"Felt extremely rushed when ordering. I understand that this pizza place prides themselves on speed, however I've eaten at other Mod pizzas and this one's focus on speed made for an unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"First time at MOD Pizza ... it's a fantastic concept - order/build your pizza exactly the way you want it; pick every single ingredient, from the sauce to the seasoning that you want to add to the other ingredients. As many toppings as you want ... and all this for one set (excellent) price"}
{"text":"Super tasty personal pizza and I love that they serve beer here.  The staff is sweet and the food taste great.  This place is like a Subway for Pizza :)"}
{"text":"Another family grabbed my pizza on their way out, and the staff here went above and beyond to make sure that I was taken care of after the mistake. Their pizza is so good, and their staff is even better!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza with even better staff & service!  Love having this place close by as it will satisfy my pizza cravings!"}
{"text":"I have a new favorite pizza place and it is MOD! The basic concept is great - fast and completely customizable pizzas. The extraordinary part is that they were are all the same price of a low $7.77.   We came in one weeknight and could not have had a better experience. I made a custom pizza with pepperoni, ham, black olives and pineapple. With extra cheese, obviously. Basically all my favorite toppings that I never get together because of the standard per topping price most pizza joints have. My boyfriend got the Jasper, which seemed to be made with him in mind with just spicy sausage and mushroom.  Everyone was super friendly and since he and I like completely different toppings it was great to not have to do the normal compromise dance.   When the worker called me up for our order he explained there was an incident with my boyfriend's pizza and it folded in the oven. Not to worry though because a replacement was already cooking! He boxed up the offending pizza for us to take home. When we opened the box we saw a barely damaged pizza that other places would have served. I couldn't believe the great quality control. They showed me they really care about the product they sell and I was glad they were not wasteful."}
{"text":"Awesome concept for pizza. They charge one price for size and you can load it with toppings. Try their raspberry lemonade or carmelized pear tea. There is always a line but totally worth the wait. Friendly staff. Just wish they had different crust besides paper-thin . Sometimes I like a good thick crust."}
{"text":"One of our very favorite places to eat! We get mini's and it's the perfect size!! Unlimited toppings, tons of choices! The blackberry lemonade is delicious! My only complaint is that the music is SO LOUD! We have eaten here a lot, and this is always the case.  Makes it a little hard to for them to hear you order your pizza, and for us to hear our name called. But, that doesn't stop us from eating here!!"}
{"text":"I took one bite and I'm in love!! The thin crispy crust is to die for! Generous toppings and very inexpensive no matter how many toppings it's the same price!!! Im telling everyone about this place! So glad we tried it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Choose your toppings, 1 set price per size. Great flavor! Pizzas made fresh and cooked perfectly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Literally the best pizza ever! The blackberry lemonade is soooooooooooOOOOOOOOO good! We loved everything we ate and the customer service was amazing. I WILL be bringing my family back and can't wait to eat this again! Amazingggggggg pizza preppers!"}
{"text":"Kindra was awesome at making our pies! Great dinner with the fam! Can't wait to make it back here!"}
{"text":"Our whole family enjoys MOD because everyone can get just what they want on their  pizza. You go in choose between the combos the have or build your own . We bulid our own they have mu ltiple  options of most choices sauces,cheeses wide variety of  veggies and meats. Pizzas come in 2 sizes 11in or 6in 8yr olds both get the 6 and usually have a piece left 11 yr old and hubby and I  get the 11 hubby finishes his son and generally have some to take home. Pizzas  are all 1 price no matter what you get on it . Take maybe 5 minutes to get your pizza .the also have salads and a couple of dessert options but we never tried either. Have a couple  of beers on tap and some bottled one as well  around 45 dollar for our family of 5"}
{"text":"Mike, Gary, and the rest of the MOD crew are the bomb dot com. Gary could tell it was my first time in and immediately helped me out picking out the perfect pizza! They were fast and the pizza was awesome!  Blaze, they're giving you a run for your money"}
{"text":"Subway meets pizza making. The ingredients are high quality and the stone cooked pizza is amazing. Mod stands for modern pizza. Great experience and makes most other pizza places obsolete."}
{"text":"Best NY/Italian Style Pizza In Indian Trail, NC 28079. Brand New Location right across the street The Sun Valley Movie Theatre, Sun Valley High School right beside The Shell at The Harris Teeter Parking Lot by Wells Fargo ATM."}
{"text":"I like the concept - same a fired pie - because I enjoy making the pizza different each time. Quick service as expected. Beers on tap which is a BIG WIN over that of Fired Pie's bottle beer only. Price is right as well - $18 for Judy and I to each get a pizza and drink for lunch."}
{"text":"Pizza is always good, but the wait is generally long... Like stupid long wait for walk-up pizza."}
{"text":"If you like thin crust individual sized pizza, this is your place! I had been to Fired Pie recently, and I enjoyed my pizza here more at MOD Pizza. The toppings here tasted better with an adequate level of seasoning, I liked the crust more, and ordering was easier from MOD.   I also like how you have a choice of three different crust sizes depending on how hungry you are. I ended up with a small sized Dillon James with added mushrooms, artichoke, and black olive. The toppings were plentiful but the crust still stood up to them vs. getting soggy due to the liquid content.  My small pie was around $5, and soda fountain drinks a little less than $2. In addition to Coke products they have 2 different lemonades and 2 different iced teas available.  I'll be back to try more custom pizza creations!"}
{"text":"Five stars! I don't even like pizza much, but you can get white sauce or pesto (I got both). So basically it was a thin crust garlic bread with cheese and veggies. I think of it as a subway of pizza. You pick your sauce, veggies, meat, cheese... And they wood fire it for you in no time! They only have thin crust, so that's the only thing you can't personalize on your personal pizza, by that helps with how quickly they can serve you. It was thumbs up from everyone in my family, so we'll be back."}
{"text":"Why does my family continue to go back to Mod Pizza? Because they rock. Today my husband went to pick up a take-out order we placed online for 2 pizzas. When he arrived he was told they dropped one of the pizzas (he saw the upsidedown pizza on the counter-ready to be thrown in the garbage) and had to create another. They gave him a lemonade for having to wait AND they made 2 new pizzas, even though the first one was perfectly fine. Why? Because they wanted both pizzas on our order to be hot when he walked out the door.. And they gave us the perfectly fine, but cooled off pizza as well. The last time my husband was there they had run out of gluten free pizzas (which he only orders) - because they had a bad batch. He decided to call the next day to tell them what happened, only because he still had a craving for Mod Pizza and wanted to place an order. When he arrived to pick up his pizza they gave it to him - no charge!  Who does that?!!! Their customer service is outstanding! Keep doing what you're doing!"}
{"text":"This place rocks. Love it, Like having the choice of sauces and the sizes are just right. Have recommend them to a lot of people."}
{"text":"Ok been so excited to try this cute new spot. We LOVED it. AWSOME staff and salads and pizza is YUMMY. Very reasonable pricing too. Love it and will be visiting weekly"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and welcoming. They were very willing and happy to help the gentleman behind us who had never been there before.  The pizza cooked very quickly and there were many yummy options to choose from.  The lemonade was absolutely delicious! I will return"}
{"text":"I won't be able to say enough good things about the service.   I walked in with my best friend because we both had a long day of working and just finished shopping. We were on yelp at the mall to figure out what we were craving and MOD pizza had a lot of tremendous reviews so we decided to stop by and give it a try.   So, walking in, we were greeted by the busser. We stepped towards the line and had to really look at the menu since we didn't know what to expect. The first guy in line asked if we had ever been here before and we said no. The menu is comprised of the classics and some ideas for you to order if you didn't want to create your own.   I can't remember what my best friend ordered but it was the spicy one on the last row of the menu while I created my own. The guys preparing my food were more than nice and happy to serve me. I was really nervous because I didn't know what I wanted on my pizza before I got in line. I had to wait and see every time they asked me so I seemed high maintenance with a \"little bit of garlic\" and a \"little bit of red onions\" and a \"some oregano\" but they were very kind to me.   A normal 11\" pizza was $7.97 with a thin crust.  It filled me up and I still had leftovers to bring home. However, my best friend and I are young adults that don't eat too TOO much so you may finish your pizza and still be hungry, so there is a bigger pizza option for around $10.   We waited for our food as the manager shouted names in the most lightheartedly loud and cheerful way to pick up the pizza. He did this for every customer and it was fun to listen to, haha.   You then get to choose a finisher for your sauce and you had options to choose between spicy buffalo, red sauce, ranch, and more. You could always have it on the side if you didn't want it over your pizza. He also gave us a sauce to try that was like \"liquid crack\" as he said and it was VERY good, LOL.   I told him this was our first time here since I seemed super indecisive and he even offered us a free cinnamon pizza. They checked on us and were super nice about giving us caps and lids for our food. The busser basically didn't let us clean up when we walked to the trash can because he said he got it, he was also very nice.   Honestly, I would just come back here for the service I received! The food was great and well cooked. I am definitely returning with my best friend for pizza dates!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  This time I brought my daughter. She loved creating her own pizza! They were short staffed & everyone was so busy but I was impressed they didn't act stressed or snippy! I did get scolded by a male employee for pointing at an ingredient I wanted with my hand over the glass   The blackberry lemonade was incredible.   My only complaint is more veggie toppings!!!"}
{"text":"They make a mini pizza for in minutes, you basically start out with a crust and customize it with what you want.  There is NO price per topping, the sky is the limit here! do whatever you want!!  The staff is nice and place is alright, they awesome little to-go boxes, this is a great pizza place for almost anyone and any occasion."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this particular MOD Pizza location a couple of times, most recently today. Their pizzas are great and the service I have received has been good - my only complaint is they skimp on the toppings. You can see them strategically place toppings like pepperoni and salami. When I order pepperoni on a pizza, I want to see it covered with pepperoni. This may just be a personal preference, but please just be a little more generous with the toppings. Other than that, it's a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Real good for a quick personalized pizza with a great selection of toppings. Plus Boylan's bottled soda!"}
{"text":"I like MOD pizza...but not the Garlic Stripes  Garlic Stripes definition from the MOD website and restaurant menu : Garlic Strips - Dip into red sauce, pesto, ranch or spicy ranch.  I was expecting I will get Garlic Strips... In reality, it comes with cheese, A LOT OF ROSEMARY and little bit of garlic flavor.  Menu does not inform about ROSEMARY at all.   I didn't like the taste and lack of description on the menu...."}
{"text":"Unbelievable pizza and even better customer experience!! Emma was BEYOND helpful in making our our pies and her personality made us feel like we wanted to come back every day for lunch!!  If you're in the mood for pizza or just looking for a nearby lunch spot then look no further!"}
{"text":"Best customer service I've had in Gilbert so far besides liberty market. Just left and feel happier than when I went inside. The staff was truly incredible. I love the pizza and getting to pick as many toppings as I wanted was delicious. I have to say the customer service was what blew me away there were three employees there and they were all engaging, happy and just plain super cool. I can't wait to take the whole family here. I love that it's open till 10 PM to we were able to grab a bite after practice."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have MOD pizza in our area. Most of my friends don't like it but I love it. The folks are always quick to greet you as you enter the restaurant. They all seem to be happy and enjoy working there. I love being able to add whatever toppings I want but this time I opted for just pepperoni. Watching them make it is a plus for me. I love cheese so I always ask for extra mozzarella and they will pile it on for you. It's a nice place to eat and hangout especially since there's an outdoor patio for those nice cool nights. Then of course as you are leaving they always thank you and say goodbye."}
{"text":"I started this review looking for a reason to give it 4 stars simply because I don't often award chain restaurants such high ratings. But really I can find literally no logical reason to do so. I seriously love Mod and I love this business concept. I don't know if Mod was the chicken or the egg but made to order pizza has become a huge thing quick it would seem. Some call it the Chipotle or Subway of pizza but I call it its own thing. In terms of variety and options: all other made to order restaurants have nothing on Mod.  I can't start without mentioning that the prices are astoundingly low for what you get. You get a personal thin crust pizza with unlimited toppings of your choice for one flat price: $8.52 including tax if you decide to leave no tip. You can upgrade to gluten free crust for a few dollars but that's the only upcharge you'll see. There's the usual red sauce plus add-ons for the sauce such as pesto and some others I've honestly never used. I think I saw a barbecue sauce in there. For toppings, a non-exhaustive list includes: whole garlic cloves, tomato, sundried tomato, red and yellow peppers, green peppers, olives, roasted cauliflower, hamburger, ham, Canadian bacon, pepperoni, grilled chicken, sausage, and on and on. I'm not doing it any justice with my list. At the end of the bacon you can even add one of at least 6 toppings onto the pizza to get even more bang (or zing) for your buck.  There are also several bottled sodas (Boylan) to choose from along with a litany of fountain drinks and even a few beers. You can even round out your meal with a milkshake too. And if you want to forego the carbs entirely there are all of your basic salad greens on the bar with which you can make a stellar salad composed of any or all of the above.  Finally, you can visit and eat here knowing that you're supporting a good cause too. That's because they hire and employee many ex-convicts and people who have served time in prison and would otherwise find difficulty in getting employed again as a result. Very cool!"}
{"text":"I typically have a very amazing experience at MOD pizza. For starters, it is a very fast and convenient means to get pizza, and the pricing is really fair considering you get free unlimited toppings. They also have dairy free cheese! So to all of my fellow vegans or dairy-sensitive individuals out there, this is a great place to go if you don't want to pay a lot of money at another pizza chain or buy frozen. The first time i went, everything was perfect as far as customer service went and how the pizzas turned out. There have been a couple of times i have gone, however, where a pizza that was ordered was not cut or they did not offer any of their finishing sauces. I'm not sure if this is just due to them being busy and maybe forgetting, but it has been on more than one occasion. Overall, a fantastic place though. Brought a couple of pizzas home for a night in with my parents and now they are hooked too!!"}
{"text":"The pizza was great. The customer service is super,  will be back. If you have been to fired pie, you will really like MOD Pizza they have more toppings and very reasonably priced. Thank you for a great experience"}
{"text":"Love this place. Just a suggestion... honey and chili peppers. I tried it on a pizza and it was amazing I think it was called the angry bee. One of the best pizzas. If you guys offered this I would be insanely happy and would probably never order hungry howies or dominos. Also another friendly tip.. the employees making the pizzas need to smile more and have more energy. I understand their job consist of lots of repetition and it can get stale but it could make this place go from good to great!"}
{"text":"Solid, fast \"chipotle-style\" pizza place.  I go here all the time and the quality of the food is consistently good and the staff are young and friendly. The thin crust is a little crunchy and a little chewy (which is great) and they have tons of fresh ingredients to choose from.  It's not authentic Italian pizza (it's not trying to be) but it's way better than any other fast pizza place you'll order from."}
{"text":"The choose-your-own-pie movement is really picking up steam in the Charlotte area, what with the likes of Blaze, Pie Five and Zablong, so why not throw another into the mix? At Mod (er, MOD), there really isn't that much of a difference - they all have a pie crust, and you choose your toppings. However, they give you a CiCis-style welcome, making you feel at home. They have some warmer decorations. But in the end, there isn't a huge difference here.  Where this will probably win is against Pie Five, which is literally right around the corner. Pie Five took a dark concept, with black/dark walls, and here MOD is a brighter, corner space, with loads of windows and welcoming wood walls, with pictures of people being all MODdy (or something.  On that decision alone, MOD will likely win. It's also a lot easier to see them, rather than being tucked into an odd little space like Pie Five (at least in this location).  When it comes to the food, there is not a huge difference, but MOD does have a few toppings that are a bit healthier-seeming. I say seeming because you are putting them on a pizza, after all. In that sense, it's a bit more challenging - the MOD menu happens just before you sidle up to the bar to place your order. So you get there, and see all these tasty-looking toppings, and then completely forget what you just ordered, so you end up looking back to see what pizza you ordered, and ultimately put extra stuff on anyway. It would probably be better to print up little cards so you could reference it along the way - though that would surely cost a good bit more. Or just put the menu overhead.  For those who do not like pizza all the much, they do have salads, but this is another puzzling decision. You can actually order a \"side salad\", but it's challenging to do so - they really want to sell you a \"salad on a pizza - which is what it sounds like, a salad on a pizza crust. It's also about twice the cost. The side salad is tucket in under the Mini MOD pizza so you can barely see it. But it's there.  The other strange thing is that even though all (or most) of the toppings are cooked, the staff is dunking their hands in them. First the meat, then the veggies, then back to the meat. Not sure that's a good thing. I seem to recall they use to have scoops that they would use - I guess those took too long, so now they just use their hands. I would imagine this increases their food costs as well - we'll see how that goes.  And they also have their no-name cake for dessert, which looks an awful lot like a ding-dong in an aluminum foil wrapper. If that's not your speed, you can also grab a milkshake or one of a couple of beers that they have on tap. All in all it's a nice place for a quick bite, and worth a visit."}
{"text":"The customer service was excellent! The pizza was delicious...you can LITERALLY get every topping on the menu. The price for what you get is unbeatable. It's worth the wait for everyone to get exactly what they want. Again, the best customer service!!! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I found this place on yelp and wondered what it would be like. It's been opened for approx 3 months and I never saw it there. Needless to say, it's a great find!  I like the fact that you can pretty much put whatever toppings on your pizza that you want. Pretty much create your own. The workers are nice and polite and the environment is simple but cool.   My only complaint is the beers are way over priced. I mean really, $5 for a cup of beer. Oh well, just order a pitcher and you get several cups for under $12. Lol  All in all a great place to go. I went 2 days in a row and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. They weren't that busy. We each ordered the medium pizza and added our toppings on it. Places like this is great for picky eaters or if you are in the mood to try different stuff! It wasn't long until we got our pizzas. They were baked great and very good!! From walking in to leaving, we received nothing but excellent customer service from EVERY employee!! Kudos to the staff and management. We will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Solid 4+ stars! Think Chipotle for pizza...you go up to the counter and order whatever/as many toppings as you wish (no extra charge!) and then they cook it in the oven so it's piping hot when they bring it to your table - which took probably no more than five minutes.   My boyfriend gobbled his down and I took some home - totally appreciated the reheat instructions on the box.   The entire staff was so friendly and they even have a small selection of local beer/wine on tap. My only suggestion would be smaller slices as it's a bit hard to pick up with all the toppings.   We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't done a review for MOD before now. We love MOD! Great food... friendly people... comfortable space... speedy service.... reasonable prices.  What more could one want? You get to have your personal pizza however you want it!!! Yes, that's right HOWEVER you want it. You don't pay extra for any toppings. Just tell 'em what you want from the wide variety of options available to you. Can't decide? They have some tried and true combo suggestions that may help you."}
{"text":"We go here often, it's quick easy and good. It's typically always clean although the last time we were here the staff was not emptying trash cans so it was a challenge to clean the table off. Over all always friendly and the food is fresh cooked right and no complaints. If you asked me one thing to change I would say to put extra cheese when someone asks, they don't like to dole out the cheese, we have to ask them a few times. Their no-name cake is a ding dong, but some how tastes better. Will go back time and time again!"}
{"text":"Love coming here in a pinch. Price is good , taste is \"meh\". Better tasting pizza at Peter pipers down the street."}
{"text":"Had a taste for pizza tonight so decided to try Mod Pizza. It kinda reminds me of a Subway set up were you pick your toppings (as many as you want) and they also have menu type pizzas on the wall to order also. I have to say the pizza was pretty good, the prices IMO are kinda high but good food is not cheap. I had a pepperoni, grilled chicken and green peppers pizza."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza place! ! Kinda like the subway of pizza...have great pizza selections. .many different combos of pizza...a salad pizza...great  place a must try. ..will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"I have heard great things about this pizza place an its right near my friends house. My friends are vegan so it was great to see Mod had non dairy cheese for them. Tons of great fresh veggies, great crust not the thick dough you get at other pizza places. They also have salads made fresh right in front of you as well. They have wine my friends loved that. Its great we found a great pizza place an we can all get what we want on our pizza. My favorite thing is you can have 10 toppings its the same price. The staff is very friendly an helpful i will be back ."}
{"text":"This is not Pizza. It's a Pizza-like snack on a tortilla type crust. I like the customization and the varied options for cost depending on size. I ordered the preset BBQ mini pizza which was very sweet with the double dose of BBQ sauce. The cashier rang me out for the personal size and had to re-do my transaction. She was focused on balancing her till rather than getting my purchase amount correct. The dining room was mostly empty except for the store manager and an associate discussing personnel issues along with a couple more associates off on side having a personal conversation. I wouldn't recommend this place unless you really like flatbreads."}
{"text":"My nephew and niece, ages 12 and 11 respectively, love this place and talk about it all the time so I thought I'd give it a go...WOW!!!!!! I'm a fan now. Considering it was my first time visiting I was kind of unsure about how to build a pizza so Shane walk me through the process. Then he turned it over to Monica who did the toppings for me, and I requested it's being done well done happy for Paul put it in the oven he explained to me well done and the different levels of it and let me choose which one I wanted the most and damn the pizza came out perfect.       But I believe the best thing about going to MOD pizza here on Elliot  was the patience Shane, Paul and Monica had with me even though they were working in a fast-paced environment. I had a ton of questions and each one of them took the time to explain to me the process each step of the way. As you and I both know,  customer service now days is almost a thing of the past and that's why I'm willing to drive 16 miles one way to come visit this place and get a pizza!!! Great pizza and awesome customer service????? Yeah  I'll spend my money with you all day!!!! 32 years in the state of Arizona and I finally found pizza that is fresh, great tasting and light on my belly and I don't feel guilty after eating it ...lol"}
{"text":"Love mod pizza! Literally, in love. It's been a while since I have reviewed but I had such great service on my visits today, and my pizza was fab. I always get the double crust and share it with my two toddlers and we are stuffed after! I got pesto, roasted garlic, garlic rub, mozzarella, artichoke, red bell peppers, feta and basil and it is da bomb. I go three times a week and never have gotten sick of it! Plus just being able to add unlimited toppings and the crust is so thin and flavorful that it is hard to stay away! Then after you can get some desert from menchies a few doors down!"}
{"text":"Love it!!! They have a menu bored or you can make your own!! It's nice going with your friends and sitting outside! And you can bring your doggies...! Great pricing. The place is a little hard to find and if you go at lunch or dinner time you will be waiting!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I am not a huge fan of these make your own personal pizza places but I must say, we just left the mod in Ahwatukee and it was really good. Lots of choices, cooked perfect and micros on tap. Even a $5 pitcher happy hour. Glad this is close by the house as we will be returning"}
{"text":"I do not give 5 stars often but just need to throw all these stars your way for impressing the crust out of me! How to order was explained to me quite well by a friendly gal and I quickly learned this is like a subway with pizza. Cool! I love seeing my food made and point to what I want on it and how much or move that mushroom to the left one inch. The difference is subway is a good price with average food. Mod pizza is a good price with excellent food! And fast! That is usually impossible! Same cost no matter how many ingredients you throw on it? Outstanding! And there's feta cheese besides the usual mozzarella, and I might have seen blue cheese. Maybe I was dreaming. Blue cheese is the reason I love Smash Burger so if this place has blue cheese I would actually move out of my apartment and sleep in your parking lot so I can eat my three cheese Canadian bacon, sun dried tomato with basal and four pieces of mushroom pizza three times a day! Ok I am not done. I'm not a thin crust pizza hater like some people giving their two cents worth. This crust is great! Tasty with a brick oven crispness you usually only find at high end pizza restaurants with New York chefs. And how did you cook it in 5 minutes? Amazing is all I have to say. Until I saw the two types of lemonades and Caramelized onion ice tea. That's when my head exploded. Cause that is the best berry lemonade ever and best tea I ever had! Enjoy your five stars Mod Pizza, you deserve it! I'll be back soon. (Might be the guy in a sleeping bag living in your parking lot!)"}
{"text":"Just tried this place. It's simple and quick. You make your own pizza or salad or you can pick off their menu. It was super delicious and I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is always great. The crew is super nice and helpful. The good is great to. I always enjoy seeing what seasonal MOD they have.   The \"Bob\" was delicious. It's great how they can come up with the strangest sounding, but best tasting flavors. Great place with good employees.... Hard to beat"}
{"text":"Wanna give a shout out to the lady who took my order, she was so well-trained and attentive. They have a lot of pizza toppings. They are fresh and delicious. The spicy saugage is bomb. The pizza came out fast and delicious."}
{"text":"PIZZAAAA!!!  MOD definitely does it right.  Do-it-yourself pizza (or tried and tested recipes, if you so wish) in three sizes, Mini (a little bigger than your open hand), Mod (11 inches, I think?), and Mega Mod (a double stacked Mod).  Throw anything and everything you want on it, or even do half and half (I recommend this) for a flat price of $4ish, $7ish, and $11ish for the three sizes, respectively.  The toppings are definitely varied and since I'm one of those weirdos who likes to throw the oddest things on my pizza, they definitely catered for that.  I had roasted brussel sprouts on my pizza, I rest my case.  They had sun dried tomatoes too, not so much a weird choice but a personal favorite of mine.  Definitely a lot of your regular toppings like sausages, pepperoni, chicken, chorizo, peppers, onions, and a couple of interesting ones like roasted garlic which I've never had on a pizza but will definitely have again - I'll promise to keep my distance so you don't smell my breath after!  I thought their pineapple looked a little too yellow but it might have just been the lighting.  And to top it off the staff were great!  Some of them were definitely new and still learning the ropes, but super, super friendly and always willing to give you suggestions and their advice so don't be afraid to ask!  I love the decor and the patio but it's still a little warm for that right now...  Unfortunately, there weren't too many seats indoors as they were mainly bigger tables and bars, so definitely good for big groups.  All in all, great place and check it out before more people find out about this goodness!"}
{"text":"We really like this place for quick build your own pizza and fresh ingredients. Also love the lemonade and tea selections. Don't love that they under fill the carafe of wine. The fill bar is clearly labeled on the carafe."}
{"text":"Sooooo good. Cheap considering what you get and no extra charge for toppings. This place is great.. It's clean, fast service, and cheap!!"}
{"text":"Really good ! The crust is so good and crispy ! Don't forget to try the garlic strips they are to die for... Also they have a really cool outside area perfect for a date or friends night out"}
{"text":"Genuinely friendly staff and genuinely delicious pizza! First time here and we loved the thin crust and all the fresh custom toppings you can pick for your pizza... that is cooked to perfection!! No need to be shy here. They welcome you as you walk in the door and you can pile on all the toppings you want! Our first pizza was enough for the two of us, but we couldn't resist ordering a 2nd one. Same as the first one and perfectly delicious again! We cant wait to come back soon. Seriously this is great pizza!!"}
{"text":"I have not been to a restaurant with employees this polite, happy, attentive, etc etc in a LONG TIME. From the moment we walked in and every single employee we came into contact with (at least 5) went just above and beyond. You don't get that kind of service nowadays, it seems. That kind of environment really makes your experience worthwhile. I actually came back today to get one of their shakes and the same experience was repeated. I'm very happy with this restaurant and the location with these employees!! Highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"First time visit and the Pizza tasted great. Quick service, nice atmosphere and I love the chicken pizza i had."}
{"text":"This place is a dream. We stopped into Mod Pizza unsure of what it was all about, but it turned out to be one of the best pizza places around.   Having the option to easily customize your pizza makes this a great option for any pizza eater.  We ordered a classic pizza and customized it.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome!!!!!! Really good, especially if you like a lot of stuff on your pizza and or dietary restrictions. I had bbq sauce, garlic, mushrooms, tomatoes, green bell pepper, pineapple, basil, oregano, rosemary, artichokes, black olives. No extra charge for the toppings cuz it's all totally customizable. I've never had bbq sauce on a pizza before. Really yummy! Great if your vegan (or meat lover). Their blackberry lemonade is so good! Really tart. Not many restaurants make lemonade sour enough for me, but there's was. The service was great and fast. I have it at four because the pizza crust is thin. I wish they had a thick crust option. Also they didn't ask if we wanted any dessert. On the website they advertise some. I'm going to try ordering online next time"}
{"text":"Amazing! Great food and great service. The staff is friendly and helpful, there's a huge selection of toppings for your pizza or salad. Love it!"}
{"text":"This is the second time my daughter and I have been here.  We had a gluten free buffalo chicken pizza and their house salad.  I love that you can add anything on your salad without being charged extra,  and they have quite the selection of pizza and salad items and dressings.  The gluten free crust was delicious! The manager today seemed a bit flustered. The front door was missing the glass, and the door frame was bent,  I have a feeling they had been robbed over night,  and being a holiday probably made it hard to get the glass fixed. It sucks because this is a new restaurant,  and my favorite one in the area.  Keep up the good work.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here to try something new and had a bad experience but the pizza was great. The guy making my pizza had to ask me 4 separate times what I ordered which was mildly annoying but not a big deal. Then I noticed that he forgot what the guy in front of me ordered and put the wrong toppings on his pizza.   They were all out of basil too which was an ingredient on two of the three pizzas that I ordered. I would have hoped the guy making the pizzas would tell me they were out of basil when I ordered instead of after the pizza was made.   The pizza was good (even without the basil) and the price seemed reasonable. The people working there however could use some help but management made up for it by reaching out."}
{"text":"For a DIY Pizza place I found the food here to be excellent.  The crust is great, the staff was helpful.  The choices of toppings are excellent. They have online ordering which I highly recommend since they are always busy."}
{"text":"I usually prefer a thick crust, but this thin crust was so GOOD I may change my mind altogether. The hubs has many allergies and was so pleased to get a gluten-free dairy-free pizza that was inexpensive and delicious. Busy place with a loud fun atmosphere. The workers are friendly, fast, and very sensitive to food allergies.  We will definitely be back again & again!"}
{"text":"I hadn't even tasted the food yet, but the customer service had already left a bad taste in my mouth. I had never eaten at a MOD pizzeria before, but a friend wanted to go, so I obliged.  When I asked Edrick (don't know if I got the spelling right), the gentleman making my pizza, what was good, I was answered with a very mumbled and lackluster \"Man, I don't know what you like. Our tastes are different\" to which I answered \"That's ok! Just make it how you would eat it.\" I was in the mood to try something new. The reply I got, once again mumbled and now in a fed up tone, was \"Man, what do you want on your pizza.\" So, I just ended up ordering a pepperoni pizza with oregano. Pretty basic. Now that I've tried the pizza, I can say that it honestly is not worth the trouble or the price. I could have bought a $3 pizza from Walmart and it would have been just as good. I also would not have had to deal with Edrick's (once again, don't know the spelling) customer service. I do not think I will be returning to MOD any time in the foreseeable future... Oh, the oregano was pretty good."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Fast casual pizza is all the rage and I've been to them all. This place fell way short. Third person in line, 35 minutes later they gave us our cold bread and our pizza had been lost. At minute 45 still no pizza and I requested a refund. Everyone in the place was having issues and the mood was very sour. The owner needs to be in restaurant this new to ensure operations are smooth. Friday night, and no owner.  I hope they get their sauce together...."}
{"text":"First time here was on Friday and it lives up to the hype. Pizza was amazing and staff was very friendly. I'll be going back for sure ."}
{"text":"Pretty great pizza! A \"little\" expensive, but you get a whole pizza so I don't blame them. I classify it like the chipotle of pizza spots. You customize your pizza however you want it, and then they throw the pizza in the brick oven and you get your pizza amazing and fresh.  The only bad things I could think of is that the pizza is always a crispy thin crust, so you cant really change the crust too much. The other bad thing is that the employees really don't care about being there. Honestly, I don't expect that as it's essentially a quick eats restaurant. The  cool thing about them not caring is that they will put extra meat and cheese on your pizza if you simply ask. They don't care about their jobs enough to charge you extra, so it's pretty awesome.  Definitely recommend! Plus the tray it comes in is also the to-go box if you need one (probably will if you don't split the pizza)"}
{"text":"Came in with mediocre expectations but was definitely pleasantly surprised.  Somewhat of a chipotle concept where you choose what you want (pizza or salad... then size) then you get to select all of your toppings that you would like.  The best part is you can walk away with a pepperoni pizza or walk away with a grilled chicken, pesto, pepperoncini, olives, mushrooms, tomatoes sliced or diced, and 10 other toppings and still pay the same price. Prices are good, and the food was good as well.  Will return."}
{"text":"Just got done eating here. It's one of the newer chipotle type pizza concept restaurants. Pick you're pizza size, add as many toppings as you want for no extra charge, wait 7-8 minutes, and bam, there shalt be pizza. it was pretty tasty. Veggies were fresh, staff was incredibly friendly, and pizza was ultimately very tasty. I can't say anything knocked my socks off; it's going to take something amazing and innovative in the pizza game for anyone to be really impressed these days, but it was very convenient and delicious. Well worth a try."}
{"text":"I love love love MOD pizza. I usually get the one with bbq sauce and Gorgonzola. It is so delicious. My favorite fast service pizza place!"}
{"text":"Wow, Mod Pizza, more like amazing; as the food, CS and we'll the over all place is so great and top of the line that you will be jumping back in line, after your done, to thank them for the greatness that just become your meal.  If you are, looking, well look to the Mod, as as they have this wall of pictures that really are something and makes this place just that much more great upon itself and well, I want to be Mod; if that is the saying way it is too me :D  That was my first time and well, I know it's not going to be my last as well, some great stuff is worth going back for and well, you will be checking your calendar and moving some things around as this might just be the next best thing and well, it really is some great stuff; you will, be happy and well, full too.  They have pizza, salads, beer, water from around the world that is so good for you that your body will be thanking you from starting of you walking through that door to the moment when you thank them and be on your way, as you just been Mod\"ed.  Their is outside setting and well, you will always find a sit as, they are always popping and well, it's so great that magic happens here as, you need a sit and you will find one; that might just be the Mod way though.  Thanks guys for doing just and having something so super, it's just so Mod of you Mod Pizza; way to Mod and Pizza too, lol."}
{"text":"I love mod pizza! I had it for the first time in Bellevue, WA a couple of years ago and when the locations started opening up in phoenix I was more than ecstatic! Abby always takes care of me when I come in and her personality makes me feel welcome. We always have jokes and it is nice to be seen as a regular."}
{"text":"I want to like this place because they have a pretty decent pie but man the staff is horrid and yet another not so good experience. Called in an order and came in to pick it up but they hadn't even made them put them in the oven...  The worst part about it there wasn't a soul on the place. The \"shift leader\" was in the back talking o  her phone and the only girl out front had no idea I even placed the order. Waited 15 more minutes for them to make the two mod size pizzas...just disappointed. When I was leaving she did give me a coupon for waiting but honestly I'd rather have had them rdy in the first place than get a free pie. Hopefully they can get things together because this isn't the first time the staff has been less than accommodating."}
{"text":"Love this place! The dough and other ingredients are fresh and much better than a typical pizza place. I love that we can get 3 pizzas, with as many toppings as we want, for $20. Customer service at his location is great!"}
{"text":"I got a mini pizza for lunch, it came out quickly even with it being busy. Everything tasted fresh. I like being able to customize either your pizza or salad and being able to see them make it right in front of you. Not crazy about thin, crispy crust in general but makes for a nice light lunch"}
{"text":"I've brought my children to this place twice and they love the pizza here and I love the prices here. It's very affordable. FYI they do not charge extra if you would like to add meat into your salad which is pretty rare! The place is always clean. Their customer service is also pretty good. We will definitely continue to come here as we're very satisfied with their service!"}
{"text":"Good single-serving pizzas, original recipes, presented with style, if slightly minimalistic all the way around. Not the best stuff (not as good as Fired Pie) but very good stuff, I've been drawn back here a few times."}
{"text":"Great selection at great prices.got myself a cheese with pineapple and mushroom. Came out faster than expected and did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Made on Demand.. love the concept .. pick a favorite off the menu or build your own ..   You start with a thin crust .. pick your sauce, cheese (including dairy free), protein, veggies, more cheese or drizzle.. they bake it and finish it with glaze if you need more delicious flavor ..   On this visit i had the tomato sauce, no cheese, pepperoni, chicken, sausage, roasted red peppers, mushroom, bell peppers, oregano, butter around the edge of the crust and finished with the fig balsamic glaze.. yum so good!!  Plenty of seating .. friendly and helpful staff.. great price for great food!"}
{"text":"First time coming here and will definitely return!  Super fresh ingredients, amazing service, and great prices.  I had a pizza with mozzarella, tomato, spinach, mushroom, black olives, and roasted garlic and a mini Ceasar's salad.  Both were delicious and I had leftovers for lunch today.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Ive eaten here 4 times now and they are pretty good. The price is awesome seeing that you can put as many toppings and shit on your pizza for 1 decent price and its not gonna run up the bill.   I guess my reasoning for the 3 stars is the toppings arent that special or \"good\", they are average. I like my pizza to have flavor and i like everything i get on it to have flavor. The crust is pretty bland. Flavored crusts would def make this place better. The toppings are just your average toppings nothing special or something your really gonna remember.  This place is better than ordering Pizza hut, dominos or such and cheaper. But this isnt a place im really gonna miss. OH AND YOU GLUTEN FREE PEOPLE- They have gluten free crust, so your taken care of as well!"}
{"text":"It's an OK place.  I feel like there are just so many of these make it yourself pizza places its hard to complete.  I couldnt make MEH last this many characters so what I will say is the staff is always friendly and people watching is always interesting.   They could chill out with the BBQ on their BBQ pizzas though."}
{"text":"I decided to stop in as I was foraging for food and didn't want to cook for myself. I arrived and was behind a family that had no idea what they wanted to eat. I'm appreciative for those moments in life that teach me patience. But, people also should be self aware enough to step aside and come up with some idea of what you may want to eat (salad vs pizza vs something else) before you get in line. As a reference point, these 3 people took about 15 minutes to order and I heard a lot of their personal 'dirty laundry'. As this was my first time in, I went with their specialty pizza 'The Bob\". It had some toppings that I normally don't have on pizza (corn and cauliflower), so I figured this was a great way to push me into trying something new. I asked for the fig glaze on top (they forgot and I didn't get it). The Bob was pretty good. Not the best topping combo that I've ever had, but the crust had a crunchy and chewy texture to it. Thin crust that held it's shape with the number of toppings on it. Super affordable pizza. I would recommend a 11\" per person (so you have some leftovers). A 11\" is about two meals for me. It was pretty good the next day too (both reheated and cold). The pizza was assembled and put into the oven. 4 minutes later, it was out of the oven and into my to-go box. Super fast and hot still when I got home. Service was friendly and professional. I will be back- thanks Mod!"}
{"text":"Love the style of this place. \"Subway\" mentality, but for pizza... don't worry, their toppings are much more fresh than Subway's. The people are extremely friendly, the pizzas and salads are top notch. ONE PRICE (roughly $8 for a personal size, $5 for a mini) for the pizzas, whether you have one topping or twenty!!! Great for those of us that like variety. pizzas are built and baked on the spot, you get them immediately, which gives you a great product. I have been to this place three times now, and will be going back soon. You've gotta try it!  The salads also look promising, several dressings to choose from and, like the pizza, you can add as many toppings as you like, same price!  A handful of local drafts on hand for those who like some beer with their pizza!"}
{"text":"Great service, FRESH, Custom made pizza... Yes please! great spot for lunch less than $10. Fixed price for one or twenty toppings! Now we are talking!"}
{"text":"Great price, the staff are always very nice, and I like all the selections. I work very close to here so I stop in about once a week. They always put extra sauce like I like! The place is clean and fast service. I love the mozzarella and garlic!"}
{"text":"This place has only been open a couple weeks, and our family has eaten there three times. I've tried the red sauce, white sauce, and barbecue. My favorite is the barbecue. Try it with chicken, spinach, and onions. Mmm. The white sauce is rather bland; I added crushed red pepper. The crust is always delicious, and it's ready quickly. Perfect spot to visit when your family all likes different things on their pizzas, and you don't have time for a traditional pizza spot. The staff is super friendly, and it's an inviting spot. There's a pokestop and gym within reach of the restaurant. :-) For drinks, they have fountain sodas, but my family likes the other drinks - fresh brewed iced tea and house-made blackberry lemonade. I just wish they had fresh bell peppers (they have roasted) and ricotta. If they ever add those ingredients, and maybe make a richer tasting white sauce, they'll earn five stars from me. Regardless, my family will clearly be eating here often!"}
{"text":"Never knew this place existed. Omg it is so good. I have been craving pizza but wanted to be semi healthy and didn't want to pay for all the fixings!! This place was a win win for me!!!!"}
{"text":"We've been there a couple of times since they've opened. I'll start out and say the only reason for a 4 star is the price. It just seems everywhere you go these days, you can't get out of there for less than $10-$12, this place is no different.   I like some of their pre-designed pies. I've created my own.  Suggestion, get a small salad and a small pizza as a nice combo.  The crust will be a little burned, but that's ok, char is OK. It comes out hot and fast. The crust is tasty. I've been to one of the other \"build your own\" pizza places and didn't like it. I suggest not over loading with toppings, otherwise it will get soggy. But don't be afraid to ask for another handful of something you like.   If you're a family of 4, you'll spend $40-$45 way too much for a pizza. Get  one from a take out place or frozen.  But for 2 people, it's fine. I like that it's walking distance from my house.   Note to manager, can you turn down the AC a little bit? I freeze when I'm sitting with this giant AC vent blowing on me. Even in the winter, you've got it cranked down.  In summary, food is good. The people are friendly, choices are endless. Comes out hot, fast, fresh.  Not so great for a family because of price."}
{"text":"Not only is the food delicious and affordable, but the staff is amazing. We are always greeted with a warm hello and feel like family as we make our way through the line. We've been to other MOD locations, but this one is definitely our favorite. We'll go out of our way just to eat here."}
{"text":"\"MOD\" sized pizza with white sauce, mozzarella, mushrooms, green peppers, garlic, artichokes, sausage and chicken on thin crust. My mom and sister in law went here for a quick lunch. It was so fast and the pizza was delicious. We all walked away stuffed and happy! Also, I recommend trying the blackberry lemonade!"}
{"text":"Love MOD pizza - and all pizza to be fair and honest. This location is a part of the Tempe Marketplace so if you are out doing some shopping and get hungry or have a group of people who need a few options, this place is good to go.   Inside we were created by friendly staff members who were ready to help and explain how it worked. We chose to build our own pizza - does it get any better!?  Pretty much you load that crust up with everything you ever dreamed of on a pizza. It's pretty much a fat kids dream pizza for a decent price. Our group definitely took advantage of the variety of toppings and loaded them on.   Check out these pizzas!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It's basically pizza made to order although they have a few of their own to choose from. Some of my favorite things about this place: sauces other than tomato! #pestofan AND it's the same price no matter how many items you choose!  Delish."}
{"text":"Stopped by check this place out over the weekend. The thing I love about this place, is that you can add as many toppings as you like, but the price stays the same. These wood fired style pizzas are truly an Italian Pie aficionado's dream come true.   Everyone was super friendly and helpful - they could tell I was new, so I really appreciated their help and patience.   They also have a really sweet and spacious patio if you like to dine outside.   Check em out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Since the first time I stepped into MOD, I've been there a total of four times. My first impression was awful, but someone gave me MOD gift cards for Christmas, so with some reluctance, I decided to give it another try. I was pleasantly surprised! I find their pizza's to be absolutely delicious!!   I love their pizza crust a lot more than their toppings, hence the 4 stars. They are a close second to my favorite place.   Mind you, I love wood fired pies! And right now,  in Goodyear, in order from best to least, my favorites are:  1. Blaze -- overall top notch in taste, dough, and fresh toppings! Plus their drinks are amazing-- their Blood Orange Lemonade is the bomb!!! 2. MOD -- Love the dough, especially when they crispy up those pies! Toppings okay...not a lot of sauce or cheese varieties that Blaze has, but I like that they have corn, grilled asparagus, and grilled broccoli. 3. Pieology - Their pies are good, but their Chocolate Churro Pizza is to die for!!! 4. Fired Pie - it's okay, not my favorite, but I would definitely go there, again, for their Fired Pookie -- nothing beats mini chocolate chip pie  with creamy vanilla bean ice cream!   So, MOD is runner up to my absolute fave, but in the world of food, anything can change..."}
{"text":"First time today. Had a line about 25 long today. After order was a bit of a wait as well. But that's the east valley for you. We attack the new hot spots as their is not much out here. Ordered the jasper and added a few things. Loved not having to worry about extra charges for toppings. The mod or regular size was perfect for just me. Pizza was fantastic. Will be back."}
{"text":"The service was good . The guy was very friendly. The young lady was so so when asking her to sample the different sauces ."}
{"text":"So much fun!  There is something for the whole family.  Every time we go, our daughter looks for the sticker she put on the wall last time we visited!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place with my boyfriend only 30 minutes before it closed, and had never been here before. We were warmly greeted and given the run down of how pizza service worked, other food options, etc., and the person helping us out was super friendly and chill.  Believe it or not, I actually don't really like pizza. I'm super picky about it, don't generally eat American styles, and even then I suppose one would say I'm snobby when it comes to pizza eating. I like simple and tasty, and appreciate a good crispy crust with not a ton of sauce. The beauty of MOD is I picked what I wanted and how much of it. It was awesome!  Needless to say, I'm totally coming back, and I'm bringing my friends."}
{"text":"Alright. So everyone knows MOD is compared to Fired Pie. I've had both and honestly. MOD isn't THAT great. It was DECENT but I think the biggest thing is the fact that pretty much whatever you get on it, it's gunna slide right off because the pizza isn't cooked enough to really crisp it to be sterdy and they put ALOT of sauce. Which isn't too bad but I've gave them a chance 3 times said \"Light sauce\" \"Cook a little longer\" and I guess it's just not working. Not really blaming staff, I just guess that's how their oven is or ingredients. Whatever. BUT The TASTE of it was the best part. It is flavorful. But I just don't recommend this place unless you're a soggy pizza eater. And the whole argument of them having MORE ingredients than Fired Pie.  They have like one extra meat and cheese. No worries. Not missing much"}
{"text":"5 Stars all day to the awesome crew at Mod Longbow. First try on the pizza was a tad over cooked, they let me keep that one and promptly gave it another try.  As I finished my Orange Blossom, they had a new pie ready within minutes and even provided a coupon for my next visit. Well done Mod Longbow, I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Pizza in a pinch. Great for a quick bite. Large pizzas are not as large as you'd expect, and you should ask for extra sauce. Besides that, great, quick and fresh."}
{"text":"Went last Thursday night, the place was packed but it was worth the wait, the pizza was delicious and I though it was so cool that you can build your own pizza, no need to paid extra for toppings."}
{"text":"Wait?  Did I say something about the crust?  I dunno, but that Santan Devils Ale out of the tap is a great tasting beer.  Getting a pitcher to go with your pie is the way to go.  But only if you are not the DD."}
{"text":"I love this place! Fresh ingredients plus baked in a wood fire oven. Who could ask for more? Great atmosphere and friendly staff makes this place more enjoyable. The restaurant is always clean and welcoming. We've been eating here since they opened and I just realized that I haven't left a comment. Why get a plain boring cheese pizza when you can come here? Don't forget to get chopped basil on your pizza before they put it in the oven! So tasty!"}
{"text":"I come to this MOD once a week for a MOD sized custom pizza, small salad, no name pie (Ding Dong like chocolately goodness) and the blackberry lemonade. I generally arrive before the dinner crowd around 4pm and have always had good service. This amount of food will serve me for 2 to 3 meals and the bill is about $20.  I recommend customizing your pizza but some of the menu pizzas are really great as well. The Calexico is especially good if you are craving something spicy and filling. The Maddy is a great basic pizza if you eat in.  My favorites are to add whole roasted garlic cloves, fresh basil or the balsamic drizzle at the end. I also like adding kalamata olives vs black olives.  I wish there was a frequent visitor program, because I come so often."}
{"text":"MOD has been the. Eat pizza I have ever had in my life and it is super fast and affordable. You can load your pizza up with every topping they offer and still only pay $7. The management has been super nice to us and one time our pizzas came out slightly crispy on the edges and they refunded us our money and offered to make us another one if we wanted. Come here if you want to be happy and eat amazing pizza.   Fun fact: They actually have the recipe for Ding Dongs but not the naming rights, so their no name cakes are freshly baked Ding Dongs. I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Great ingredients. Great pizza. Great drinks. Great service. Honestly what more can I say. Went once with a friend and loved it. I don't live in the valley but on my next trip down I made sure to stop in with more friends! Love the fresh ingredients and thin crust made however you like it! Definitely coming back when I get the chance! Shout out to Nick and the crew working there! Great job guys! Thanks for great lunch!"}
{"text":"My family and I (husband & 2 boys) visited here for the first time today! We had been meaning to try MOD Pizza out but just never got around to it until now. I have no idea why we waited so long! The pizzas we ordered were delicious and freshly made as well as the garlic bread strips which were yummy but with a bit too much garlic (since it was my first time, I didn't bother to watch them put the garlic on and will tell them to go easy on our next visit). The prices for the pizzas were more than fair and the only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was the drink prices. I realize you can refill your cup for free, so I have no problem paying the price for an adult fountain drink. I only wished they had kid's cups with kid's cups prices. However, we will be back again and looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"I really like the pizza here.  It tastes fresh and it is my go to spot in the East Valley."}
{"text":"Good fresh NY style pizza.  Skip the dessert tart.  Best thing about MOD?  Unlimited toppings.  Service was quite good, including their attitudes.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Was just ok. Friendly staff and was fast but FiredPie and Pizza Studio are better their crusts have more flavor. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes and yesssssssss. Finally gluten free dairy free pizza! This place is the bombbbb. One flat rate for all the toppings you want? Count me in. And that pear iced tea though... Yum! I bet the flour crust is amazing but the free is typical of most gluten free crusts. So good! Love the daiya cheese option... They seriously cater to everyone!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Great price! Nobody to blame but yourself if the toppings aren't right :-)"}
{"text":"I guess I am one of the few people in Indian trail who is actually excited about aNother pizza place moving in. Before you assume that mod is just a pizza place, you have to go visit. It is unlike any pizza place locally. I had the Caspian and the mad dog pizza. Both were fantastic. The service was awesome.  The price is great considering you're getting a freshly made pizza, and they also have delicious salads that you can load anyway you like. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"We love Mod Pizza! Really good pizza, great service and super nice staff. We stopped in there the other night at 9:15, the doors were open but they were actually closed. I saw that the oven was still on and asked if they could make just one more pizza. They were just putting everything away but they made us a pizza! Now that's great customer service! We will be Mod pizza fans forever!"}
{"text":"Holy crap this place is great. Pick your own pizza like a subway? This place is really cool. Everything looks super fresh and well done. Little crowded but with good reason. Staff are very quick and nice. The prices honestly aren't bad considering how much you really get. I would totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"MOD, thank you so much for having us out for an introductory pizza last weekend! We had a great time!!  This MOD location is brand new, super clean, and very comfortable w/ some bonus outdoor seating. The staff are friendly, helpful, and very enthusiastic and this truly feels like a customer service oriented environment. The folks at MOD Pizza really want you to have a great experience.   We loved out pizzas - three total. All toppings were fresh, perfectly proportioned, and delicious. The base sauce/crust/cheese are all perfect leading to a fantastic end result no matter what your style (Hawaiian vs. Buffalo chicken vs. meat lovers).   I certainly recommend that you give MOD Pizza's newest location a try! The only feedback that I've got for improvement would be that they consider expanding beyond beer to include a few wine by the glass options as well."}
{"text":"I get that they only have 1 fire pit for the pizza but a place like this that their most popular thing on the menu is pizzza, it should have another one to make the process go a lot faster.  But they were all friendly and the pizza was amazing and cooked perfectly!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to get pizza. Employees are always friendly and pizza is great. Best part is you can make it your way."}
{"text":"I liked every but the crust it was too thin and the size is not consistent.       The staff was friendly. My children enjoyed placing there personalized sticker on the wall as well as having the freedom to pick from the many toppings.   Yes I will return to make my custom pizza."}
{"text":"A decent place for az's growing market of fast casual pizza restaurants. I got a MOD sized pizza with pepperoni, spicy sausage, salami, chorizo, jalopenos, roasted red peppers and broccolini. The pizza itself was good but it was a bit salty for my taste. And the crust wasn't crispy throughout the pizza. I think the addition of broccolini may have caused that. All in all, a decent pizza. Would I come back to try it again? Sure, because every place deserves multiple visits."}
{"text":"Went here Sunday afternoon for lunch and I really enjoyed my experience!   My husband and I both ordered the Mad Dog pizza and added basil, bell peppers and he added jalapeños. It was good! I liked the wood fired crust. And I liked how quick the pizza came out! Also, I didn't know this going through the first time but they don't charge for additional toppings so definitely get what sounds yummy to you! I know this is a weird thing to enjoy about a restaurant but I really liked their ice- weird compliment I know.   I will definitely return for a quick and yummy lunch and to chomp on the ice!"}
{"text":"It's like the Subway of pizza. Similar to Fired Pie or Blaze.    You can select your own toppings and sauce or order one of their pre-selected toppings pizzas from the menu. They bake it in the fire brick oven. You can have additional sauce to top it off after it's done. I like the pesto.   FAST, delicious, and reasonable. I think it was about $8 per pizza. This is the new and trendy pizza. The dudes that work there are good looking too! Something to look at while you wait for your pizza!  Excellent!"}
{"text":"Excellent choice pizza with the quickness! No joke you can be in and out so fast its worth 5 stars alone.  Service is down home style too- which I love! I went at 11:30am and totally beat the what may/may not be a lunch crowd. While I was seated I was kindly/I presume totally randomly brought some lovely cinnamon crispies to try. Sweet!! ....30 minutes later:  I Love the cinnamon crispies!! They were uhhh-mazing!!!! Thank you for the 80's MODern Rock playing too.   How cool is it that even when I left at noon this down home crew who was managing this choice MOD Pizza loc, had this crowd tamed 100%. Bravo! I'm into this place!!"}
{"text":"It's like a chipotle but with pizza ! Love the concept, pizza is tasty not going to lie and say it's the best I've had but it's still very yummy. Area is comfortable and clean, their staff is beyond helpful! If you don't like the way it turns out maybe too crispy they offer to remake it for no charge. I actually forgot my debit card once I only had 9 bucks cash my total was 18! So embarrassing but the girl was soooo nice and insisted to not worry about it she took care of it for me. I just thought it was so generous of her and I plan to leave her a good tip next time! Also they have beer and wine what else do you need to go with pizza ? Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"By far the best MODs in the region!!!!!  Wife ordered a special pizza and when they thought they messed up the owner went and made a new pie for my wife!!!!!  Great Customer Service!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  I am in love with the Blaze pizza franchise and this is a very similar place. Great seating and decor, beverage selections, and staff. The food is excellent and wonderfully customizable. I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This is  excellent pizza at an affordable price. The gluten free is outstanding! It is also very fast. Super yummy for my tummy!"}
{"text":"Definitely as good as it gets! Hands down better than any higher end pizza place......why go anywhere else! And the caramelized pear iced tea is to die for!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at a MOD Pizza once before, on a trip to Seattle, so I was excited to try this location close to home. It lived up to expectations. The service was very nice and straightforward. My husband ordered a Mad Dog pizza with jalapenos added and some garlic strips. I had a completely custom salad that filled the bowl in a way that made it difficult for her to mix it.  I had just sat down with drinks when the pizza and sticks were done--they baked up that fast. My salad was delicious, and wow, what a deal for that price. I'm used to eating big salads but I actually had to ask for a container to take some home! My husband, who was visiting MOD for the first time, really liked his pizza. He said he'd be fine with eating there again.  When we entered the restaurant, there was no line, so we zoomed right through. The crowd followed us! It was nice to see the place so busy, as I know that location has had difficulty keeping restaurants. I really hope MOD makes it. This is a place I'd love to take my mom when she visits, as I know she will love their salads, too."}
{"text":"Interesting concept. It was my first time yesterday, so I didn't know quite what to expect. They have a list of some common pizzas on the wall, so I chose one that seemed good to me. I ordered the Dominic. What's interesting is the pizza is like a flat bread, and customizable. So the guy asked me if there's anything else I wanted on it and I asked for garlic. Pretty simple and no extra charge. Kind of makes me think of 'which wich' sandwich place, if you've been.   The taste of my pizza was good, but not enough for me for five stars, but I look forward to trying more. The crust is really like a flat bread. It's crusty and also chewy, I am not sure how I feel about it. I'm curious about their chicken bbq pizza though. If they win me over with that, then I'm not hesitant to change my review to five stars."}
{"text":"I love this place. First tried it when I was in Cali and was so excited that one opened up in our neighborhood! You get to build your own pizza and toppings are endless and complimentary! Their shakes are also so good!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Open a location up by red mountain. The service is great , the atmosphere is great and I am thankful I found them due to a Yelp recommendation. I take everyone here and it's always my first pick for pizza in east valley. The salads are just as good as the pizza to!"}
{"text":"Two times I've ordered and eaten here, both times were a success.  I still have some levels to complete before I become the Yoda of pizza tasting but for me Mod pizza is grade A.   I love that you can add as much toppings as your pizza heart desires and there's no extra fee, you read that correctly... who wouldn't just give a star for that? Taste factor, YUM! Several sauces to choose , fresh ingredients, and there's a delicious gluten free crust. Oh, and no grease! I'm just not a greasy slice of pizza pie fan . Also, thank you Mod , us gluten free pizza souls appreciate you.   On-line ordering is easy, and get this, it will be ready at the time it states to pick it up . shocker, I know... it's the little things people.   Kudos to the Matthews Township location on friendly greeters and service with smiles , we've found our local , go to family , game day pizza spot ..."}
{"text":"The food is good, employees are rude and will try to rush you.  Have been here 3 times now.  The first trip, food and service was really good.  Came back within the same week to take the wife and kids.  The girl working the line was in so much of a rush to get us pushed thru, slighlty rude, talking fast and working as if there was a line if 200 people when there was nobody behind us. I was excited to take them here but they all felt so rushed it was not a good experience.  They did enjoy the food though.  Tonight, a week later, I took my brother and his family of four to try this place as they have never been here.  We were greeted amongst clearing the door.  I explained to everyone how it works, then the rudeness and rushing started again with a different female employee.  I said, hold up, they have never been here.  She then started with \"how many pies\" and started rushing everyone along.  A blondish/browrn hair bearded guy stepped in to help, as there was 8 of us (again, zero people behind us).  He continued the rushing.  My brother asked for extra cheese, his response \"this is all I can give you here, but there is more at the end if you want to add it there\".  We went outside to eat and the first comment my brothers wife said was \"wow, they try to move you so fast here they are pushy and rude.\" She stated she told the lady she  had never been here and she ignored. She said \"I felt so rushed I don't even know what I got.\"   Bottom line:  Pizza is good employees need coaching.   The guy at the end cutting the pizza and calling out orders was nice and oddly enough was the same guy all 3 trips.  The employees working the line are rude and will rush you. IMO  Every transaction here should start with \"have you been here before ?\""}
{"text":"This trend of build your own pizza shops is making my life fantastic because they are all delicious, MOD is no exception.  This location is close to my work so I usually stop on in once a week or so for some lunch when it's nice and quiet.   The location is nice, the staff is friendly and the food is simply delicious.  They have all the toppings you can want and then some. The staff is always happy to give an opinion if you are feeling adventurous or want something you have never tried.   The turn around time on the pizza is fairly quick so there isn't much wait time.   If you find your self craving some pizza, stop on in here. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This is such a cool pizza joint. You can build your own pizza for one set price. I wish they'd give an option for a thicker crust. Not a big fan of flatbread. The establishment seemed very clean, and the toppings station was very organized. The staff were very friendly too!"}
{"text":"They took over a previous pizza spot, called in a order having no idea what their deal was. I do wish the pizzas were bigger. They cater to the individual's pizza tastes and desires. We ordered 3 pizzas all different toppings, and it was very good. staff was friendly, very helpful and patient."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza and can pay one price for unlimited toppings pizza. The staff is very friendly and is fun to hang out in."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at mod pizza in Ahwatukee.  I ordered one over the net, it's online ordering system is very easy to use, my food was ready on time. The employees were helpful and extremely friendly. I enjoyed the pizza thoroughly, the crust was delicious, the toppings were fresh, and it was very flavorful. I will be back again."}
{"text":"I have ordered twice to go and overall the pizza is average. The staff is super friendly and their online ordering is super easy and convenient. I got a gluten free crust to try and overall didn't care for it. Next time I tried Normal and I liked more but again the pizza was just average tasting to me. Probably try one more time and something easy to grab to go."}
{"text":"Overall the pizza is average but knocked a star for service. I've been here twice and everyone seems miserable to work there. First try I got a normal byo pizza. Crust was burnt but had a to go order so didn't know until I got home. I did use the online order and was on time. Second order I did the extra crust because I didn't care for how thin the original crust was. This pizza was under done, again carry out so no way for me to get another. Also this time was very busy and got my pizza right away but sat and waited another 10mins for my milkshake. So my pizza got cold and on top of it the milkshake was terrible. Had a gritty texture and clearly made up of a bunch of chemicals vs actual ice cream. Was hoping for more since right down the street but with less than average food and terrible service not sure why I would return."}
{"text":"It's disappointing that my last three visits here have come with long wait times and slow service. I ordered pizza online this time, which allows you to set a pick up time. When I showed up 25 minutes later, they hadn't even started making the pizzas.  Update: One of our pizza was missing some toppings...fortunately it still tasted really good.   How I really feel... I imagine this place like it's a family member who is really good at making delicious pizza. But this family member is late to ev-er-y-thing, and they know better. I'm not going to stop being there for them 'cause they're family, but damn this is frustrating to have to deal with all the time."}
{"text":"MOD Pizza!!!! So I'm back and its been a much better experience! Of course the staff was great just like last time and they seem to have fun working together which makes it a nice place to come have dinner. Levi and Tino were great!!! Pizza was excellent and the milk shakes AMAZING!!!! I think that the kinks have have been worked out and MOD Pizza will be pretty successful here in Goodyear. When you have a company that has an owner/operator that cares about what their patrons say, you're bound to be successful! Thanks for listening!"}
{"text":"Yum.gov!! So I love pizza but the calories can multiply quickly! Mod allows you to customize your taste buds while picking calorie friendly options...if that's your thing. If not there's plenty of BACON!! Basically there are about 2 dozen topping options which includes meats, veggies,  sauces, cheeses crust thickness and size! After building your personalized masterpiece they place it in a pizza oven...this in my opinion is where the magic happens! Our pizzas came out with a perfect crust with little random burnt pieces along the edges! They also have speciality lemonades (they are kinda thick so adding a splash if water may be required)...my baby also got a little piece of cake that I barely had time to snap a picture of...so I guess that means it was good! Also last but not least they had really good customer service! Good job Mod!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Fitchburg for over a year and always had to order from or venture downtown to get a decent slice. MOD is always consistently amazing in quality and great taste at a price that doesn't break the bank. Their staff is the reason I consistently come back. They all seem to genuinely enjoy their jobs and take pride in their work. I'd highly recommend you check it out."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! The pizza is delicious. Great quality for a great price. It was so quick. Love the huge patio, they have beer and wine. The staff was super nice and helpful. Can't wait to go back. Five stars!"}
{"text":"This place is always good. I typically come here most out of the other \"build your own pizza\" franchises. Not eating meat or dairy they offer vegan options at NO ADDITIONAL COST which is awesome. Other places make you buy the gluten free crust or pay extra for the dairy free cheese which, after it is all said and done, you might as well have just made your own at home.   The other selling points to me are the size, and portioning compared to the other chains, it's just more than anyone else offers you.   The biggest deal to me, being vegan, is the cleanliness of the pizza counter. Always clean, organized, and show no signs of cross contamination.   Every time I ask then to change into new gloves they do it without question! No sighing, or rudeness, just a smile and an \"ok\".   The gentleman who gave me my pizza even said \"I used a brand new cutter to cut this for you\" without me even asking, to give me more peace of mind that there is no cross contamination. Way to go above and beyond!  These little details are CRUCIAL to people like myself and present the absolute BEST customer service experience. They weren't rushing, or panicking, or stressing to move me along.   AWESOME job team! Keep up the outstanding work!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this pizza shop. I get to create the perfect pizza and perfect portion for me. There are so many sauces, toppings, and flavor bursting layers for one flat rate. The crust is beyond exceptional."}
{"text":"With all pizzas, a lot of toppings, or extra cheese being the same price, its a fair deal. It is a fun spot to meet friends. The service is fast and the employees are friendly. It's basic build your own pizza joint. Very thin crust basic pizza, I'd come back!"}
{"text":"Holy wow, is this place real life? So good, and only 8. You can NOT go wrong with Mod Pizza. I have nothing bad to say. So much better than fired pie or sauce."}
{"text":"Fast easy to order online. It cools down fast so its a must heat when you get home. Other than that it's all good I also like the one price unlimited item menu"}
{"text":"Went there by chance and loved it! Great pizza, great price. Service was on point and the patio is large. Loved that you can put what you want on the pizza with no worries about price."}
{"text":"Guy with a great beard long hair and a green bandanna on his head is always in a great mood. Very polite and courteous, thanks for your awesome customer service!"}
{"text":"I still love this place. I eat here about twice a month. The food is consistently good, and there are so many options. I can try something new or stick with an older favorite. I'm glad to see that they are busy and doing well."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I cannot review the food here because although they took our telephone order while we were driving through Wisconsin, they didn't bother to make any of the food.  It was a complete waste of a half hour detouring from I-90 to get there. The woman working the register in the front, obviously did not care at all that we did not get our food.  Very poor customer experience."}
{"text":"The worst pizza in the world, awful, awful.  Never heard if Barbeque sauce on pizza everything was gross"}
{"text":"A Subway style pizza place is an amazing idea. The pizza is oven cooked so it isn't extremely greasy. They have alot if veg options and equaly amount of meat options.."}
{"text":"Went here last week. First off I am a fan of Pieology and I have been craving it for some time now. When Mod opened up I figured I'll go here and see if it compares. The concept is the same but they don't have as many options as Pieology. The chicken was not that great, they didn't have an herb and butter base instead I had to do olive oil... bleh! They also didn't have a Pesto or an Alfredo option for a white pizza. I tried to make my favorite which is a mix between a margarita with chicken and buffalo sauce on top. The presentation was nice but I took a bite and it was a little burnt. I thought I could get past it but I ended up throwing 3/4 of it away. Oh two more things that have nothing to do with the food but threw me off. The guy on the oven doesn't wear gloves I watched him touch everyone's pizza and slide it off the paddle into the oven. Secondly they have a British flag on their shirts. What's up with that? I'm pretty sure this is an American company... With so many similar concepts of fast casual pizza it's hard to pick a favorite but I definitely know mine."}
{"text":"Loved it. Pizza only took a few minutes. The housemade lemonade was fantastic, and they have the small spherical ice like Sonic in their soda fountain. Ingredients all looked fresh. It's a good value because you can add whichever and however many toppings you'd like."}
{"text":"I've been dining at Mod Pizza weekly since it opened -- every Friday.  In fact, Friday's are official dubbed, \"Mod Pizza Friday\" -- that's how great Mod Pizza is.  Their staff is always friendly, helpful, and the pizza is ridiculously good.  If you're hungry, the Mega Mod may be too much (got that the first time).  The Mod is good enough for the average person.  For the little ones, get the mini-mod.  The salads are great too!  And the prices, for what you get, it's one of the best dining values in the area!!  See ya'll next Friday! :-)"}
{"text":"What a blast! Pizza and salad your way!  Oh and I had the pleasure of dinning with some special folks. I am going put it out there....for fundraisers check out the MOD. I had no idea how in touch they are with the communities they're located in. I'll say it again. Stop in on a regular, enjoy the food, the people and all for a good cause."}
{"text":"I've been going to PieFive for a couple years now when a Mod Pizza went in literally 20 feet away from it so my mom and I decided to give it a shot for lunch today. Big mistake, HUGE. The people behind the counter were not very friendly. You only have one crust choice. The red sauce tasted weird. They're extremely stingy in their toppings. Then the ice maker wasn't working, my mom went to tell them that 3-4 times, eventually they sent someone to \"fix\" it after 2 or 3 other people complained. The employee fiddled with it for a minute, MAYBE, and then went back to her station and didn't come back out. We'll never be coming back here again. Go 20 feet over to PieFive they have a much friendlier staff, multiple crust options and give you as many of the topping as you'd like, plus PieFives ice maker is always working."}
{"text":"This evening enjoyed dinner with 18 of my neighbors from our park.  Michael the General Manager had our tables all set up.  Restaurant was very clean nice music playing to add to the enjoyment of friendship and what great tasting pizza!!"}
{"text":"Yelp elite group enjoying MOD pizza.  Enjoying a salad mixed with bacon, pepperoni, & black olives.  Plenty of room for your group. #mod pizza"}
{"text":"Quality food for my food hole. Can't wait to be hungry again so I can shove more food in my food hole. Staff is polite and helpful. Delicious."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, family friendly atmosphere, happy staff, and yummy pizza made for a great Friday night dinner option for our family.  I love that we can each get our own 6\" pizza and not break the bank.  That means my husband and I aren't stuck eating just pepperoni and cheese.  We tried the buffalo chicken pizza (caliexico?) and the Lucy Sunshine.  Both were great and we'll order again.  Garlic sticks could use some cheese but otherwise was a great dinner option."}
{"text":"I agree with some other reviewers' comments that the crust here is better than at other similar \"one price\" pizza concepts.  Still doesn't compare with some of the top tier pizza joints in town but definitely a good value for the money.  Worth a return visit if you're looking for something quick, cheap and better than Dominos etc."}
{"text":"Big fan of MOD pizza in general, they are always very helpful and friendly but this one is the best! Becky at this location is a rockstar and is great at what she does! She made our experience today- will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The idea is great and building your own pizza means if it's not good it is your fault. My only problem was they skimped on the meats and the cheese wasn't cooked enough. Same with the dough."}
{"text":"Kept hearing about MOD, did not disappoint. Great pizza. Great customer service and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"It's fast, it's custom-made specialty pizzas. The staff are so friendly and nice and professional. Nice ambiance. Cool music, but not too loud  (i hate when the restaurant pretends to be a night club and plays loud, terrible music and I can't visit with whomever I'm eating lunch with). The most important part: AMAZING pizza and delicious salads. Also, GREAT PRICES. Pretty sure this is my new favorite pizza."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. Fast service and made to order. Plenty of toppings available for your personal pizza. If I had to choose any pizza in Goodyear, it would probably be MOD. Better than the other fast casual pizza chains imo. Very affordable for families also. Kids love it."}
{"text":"I love Mod pizza.  The pizza is great and salads too!! My kids love to go here and choose their own pizza toppings.  I have no complaints!"}
{"text":"Just the bombest, love this location - waaaaay better than indian school location (dont go to that one)"}
{"text":"Great indoor/outdoor atmosphere, nice selection of beers on tap, excellent thin crust pizzas in a variety of sizes and toppings. Very excited to have this so close to home!"}
{"text":"Mod Pizza is personalized-quick pizza, and it's good!  Thin crust, 2 sizes, 1 price, and all the toppings you want (and how you want them!).  I ordered from a combination suggestion on the board, and the friendly staff asked if I wanted any changes, or any additions.  The pizza is fire roasted, and they offer fresh lemonades and ice tea.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I LOVE MOD Pizza!! The pizza I got was amazing and the service was great!! I am definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, salad, and lemonade. They offer pizza toppers like hot sauce and pesto."}
{"text":"True to habit, I checked out MOD Pizza based upon the Yelp reviews. I'll have to say, it is worth the chance and lives up to the reviews.  One of the great things about this place is that no matter what you want on your pizza, it is still the same price. At other pizza joints if you add a few ingredients here and there your $10 pizza becomes $20. Upon delivery it looks like a frozen pizza. But, not MODs. Conveniently located off Market, this little place is in a really great location if you are shopping on the weekend and want a quick bite to eat.  MOD has great service and you receive your food quickly. Both times I have gone to place a carry-out my wait time was super short.  I will have MOD in rotation. No doubt about it. Check it out and enjoy the good eats :)"}
{"text":"Good and fast I had the 9 a barbecue chicken pizza. The staff are super friendly and give u a inviting great at the door"}
{"text":"Love Mod! Think subway but for pizza. With amazing ingredients. They also hand recipes, too. Love that they have sauces for the pizza after they come out of the wood fire oven. Service has always been amazing. Still going back to try to perfect my perfect pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza is overall good. Long line for sure on Sat. But not too shabby and the carmelized tea is good. O,ly downfall was hearing the staff complain. Saying they wouldn't wait that long in line just for pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza restaurants look out. Best pizza in town an incredible price, no more $1 extra per topping and the great thing is that the people who work there are awesome.  Nicole, Amanda, Graham, J, pirate hat guy, they are all awesome at service and make it a fun experience .  They know my brothers name, know his pizza, his extras and are just great all around people. I dont live in the valley but have eaten here every day I have been here . 4 days. Keep it up mod."}
{"text":"Fresh and fast pizza made to go or to stay. Good selection of toppings, and staff who look like they're happy to be there and having a lot of fun. Really enjoyed my first visit."}
{"text":"Anything you want! Seriously, you can choose from one of the numerous and delicious suggestions, or go your own. The best part about choosing your toppings is you don't have to worry about the price changing. It is a flat rate no matter how many toppings you choose.  Take a stroll down Flavor Avenue with your standard pizza toppings, or take a detour to Crazy Town and try a pizza without red sauce, 4 cheeses, 6 meats, and a Sriracha finish! I personally made myself a pizza with no meat and the non-dairy cheese and it was excellent. If you are looking for a thick crust or deep dish this is not going to be where you go. The crust they offer is a thing crust but tasty nonetheless. They do offer a gluten free first for those with a gluten allergy. Also, I'd be remised if I didn't mention the excellent drink selection they offer. The lemonade here is amazing and a must have. This place is a step above the other guys, it has attitude and flavor. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! I think it's better than Fired Pie and Fired Pie is awesome. My fiancé also agrees and she loves Fired Pie. Restaurant is bigger than I thought - a lot of seats. The pizza was piping hot and delicious. I got salami, pepperoni, mild sausage and olives on my 6 inch pizza and it was delicious. Also, very affordable. A 6 inch is only $4.67. Only reason I didn't give a 5 is because the pizza maker could've been a little friendlier. She gave us the vibe that we were an inconvenience to her. She did a good job with making the pizza though. Cashier was good."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and service! Location is great, too. I love that you can get as many toppings as you want and still pay the same price as a plain cheese pizza. My favorite toppings to get on my pizza are: pepperoni, salami, spicy Italian sausage and black olives. I also love creating a buffalo chicken pizza with bacon. Pizza is melt in your mouth good. Drink choices are Coca-Cola, Ice Teas, Lemonade and beer.   Top your meal off with a freshly made chocolate shake. They're awesome!"}
{"text":"This place gets five stars from me!  I've been there several times now since it has opened!  The pizzas are amazing and the staff is so darn friendly!  They give great recommendations!  They have some pretty amazing lemonade too!  I'm a huge fan of the Tyler pizza!  It's close to my house which makes it almost bad for me because I just keep coming back!  I love it! The prices are great and the pizzas are very flavorful!  Thanks MOD for coming to my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I am updating my review because I had a complaint about discovering the gluten-free crust I thought I was getting with the mini ONLY comes in a mod size and there was nothing listed  in the store.   The company reached out and we were able to have a great dialogue about the gluten free option. It is still a great place to eat My family still eats there but now I get to take pizza home to eat! Bonus!"}
{"text":"Saw this new pizza place opened and that it was the same format as Pieology and Fired Pie, so I had to try it and compare. I was surprised how big it is! We entered on the south side, but I guess the main entrance is on the west side. They were quite busy and unfortunately we got behind a group of people who didn't understand how it worked and seemed very confused. I don't know what's so confusing about selecting any toppings you want for your own personal pizza... And they were ordering several pizzas for their large party, so it took awhile. But once we finally got up to order, I went with a Mod Pizza with red sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, crumbled meatball, bacon, and oregano. My boyfriend got BBQ sauce, chicken, and bacon. Waited at the register for several minutes to pay because the cashier was helping get pizzas out of the oven and cut into slices. While we were waiting we got to see our pizzas go into the oven. We then got our drinks and sat down at a table. Just a couple minutes later our pizzas were ready. They only cut it into 4 pieces and I prefer smaller slices so I grabbed a plastic knife. The pizza was great! Crispy (not crunchy), thin crust and the toppings had great flavor. I also tried the BBQ pizza and it was good too. The sauce is more smoky than sweet. We also experimented with the tea and lemonade to make Arnold Palmers, which I enjoyed. So aside from the annoying customers, I was quite happy with this place."}
{"text":"Long time MOD fan here, but this location is supreme (get it). First off, the restaurant is gorgeous and open. And don't get me started on the employees. Sweet angels. Today I ordered the Caspian and added pineapple with a bbq swirl finish. BOMB."}
{"text":"Loved this place today! First time here. The pizza turned out perfectly cooked and they even mixed my salad up for me then put in my bowl.  Saves me the hell of trying to mix it in such s tiny bowl and spill.  Brought the whole family. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"The first time I had MOD Pizza was at a location in Beaverton, Oregon.  I went with a friend who said I had to try it.  It was actually quite good for the price.  I started thinking about it one day when I was back in Phoenix and Googled their other locations.  Found they were opening two here.  I went to the Gilbert location and was pretty happy.  Looked forward to the Metrocenter location.  Started going there on a regular basis after they opened - about 3 times a week.  I'd have given them a solid 4-5 stars had I written the review then but never got around to it.    The last few times I've eaten there, it hasn't been particularly clean and the pizza just hasn't been as good.  I don't get how five pepperoni is enough for a pizza.  Ask for a few more and I get a total of six pepperoni.  They're cool about acknowledging when they screw up - whether it be forgetting about the pizza in the oven or someone writing down the wrong instruction, so if you have to wait too long for what you ordered, you could get a free drink or a shake or something.  Of course, I'm not sure how long that can go on.  I had three pretty crappy experiences in a row, but did go there Sunday and it was okay, but not great."}
{"text":"I just visited this place tonight and I got a small pepperoni pizza. The staff was very friendly and left a great first impression on me. The food was delicious and it was gluten free too unlike other pizza places I've been to in the past. I plan to return here and invite others to give them a chance too."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this MOD since they opened at first they were inconsistent but they have had it dialed in for some time now, toppings will rain down and feed the beast"}
{"text":"I used to really enjoying coming here. Staff was friendly and would ask if the toppings requested were enough. Now they want to get you to the end as if your burdening them. It was 3 hours before closing time and they were breaking down the toppings area as if they weren't expecting to see you. There are plenty of places with the exact same options and I'll be going there from now on."}
{"text":"\"Pizza place like Subway\" was how the place was described by our order taker.  Most pizza is \"your way\" but here there is a flat rate for as many toppings as you want. Great mini size for family ordering. Pizza was delicious. Beer on tap and Fanta and Coke bottles from Mexico with sugar (not corn syrup). Great indoor/outdoor patio and dining area."}
{"text":"Been to one when I was visiting MD.  So when I heard they had one in Indian Trail I had to come by to try.  Very good Pizza.  Fresh and Hot.  You get to choose as many topping as you like for no additional charge.  Doesn't get any better than that.  The mad dog was my choice, lots of meat and cheese.  Staff very friendly and helpful even giving suggestions if you need it.  This is my new pizza place."}
{"text":"Awesome place! First time here Kai and Paige hooked it up and the food was great! Will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Went to Mod Pizza for the first time tonight with my son. We are both very picky about pizza so I wasn't expecting much. I am glad to say it was delicious!  Even my son loved it. All the toppings you want ant no extra charge was a plus, and love that they make it right in front of you. It only took about 5 minutes for them to cook and they were so tasty. They also have parmesian,  red pepper,  and oregano shakers at the tables, which was nice. Seating was a little awkward but not enough to keep us from eating there. Will definitely return :-)"}
{"text":"Finally got to eat a Mod Pizza in Awhatukee last night.  Tried to go there twice before the after standing in line for at least 10 minutes because the serving process is so slow, we ate next door both times.  Only 1 family in front of us last night and it still took 10 minutes to place the order.  We were then treated to the worst pizza ever.  Bland doesn't even cover it.  The crust, no flavor.  The Riccota cheese, I've had paste with more flavor than that.  The Mozzarella, okay, I could kind of taste it but added with the sausage, it looks and tastes like Peter Piper.  The only thing I liked was the whole garlic pieces."}
{"text":"This place was great. The service was fast and friendly and the food was great too. I ordered the mod size, which was 4 giant pieces, and it only took like 5 minutes to be ready. I've never been to any other Mod Pizza, but this particular one is amazing!"}
{"text":"Nice new location. Spacious and with a large selection of drink options ranging from local beer to soft drinks and an array of teas and lemonades.  Then there is the pizza. They have all kinds of ingredients that you can mix and match -- or not -- on your custom pizza and then have fired while you wait (not long, either!) Sure, there are several other, \"you make it, we cook it,\" pizza places around and the idea is similar here. The crust definitely sets them apart from the others, as does their selection of post-oven dressings.    They have two crust sizes: regular and mini (for when you're flying solo and just not feeling like you can eat the WHOLE pie on your own). And both come out with a cracker-crisp crust and melted cheese (hey, that's important when firing a pizza!)  Can't decide on a topping combination on your own? They have several standards posted on the wall menu and a seasonal option as well. I had one with white sauce, sausage, Asiago cheese and tomatoes. It was great and I'll be back to try the pesto and red sauces.   The staff were friendly, helpful, and genuinely interested in making sure we were happy with our pizzas.   You can also get salads, but I don't have anything to say about those (yet)"}
{"text":"Good \"fast food pizza\"....great toppings and awesome service. We had the mad dog, and a pesto chicken pie."}
{"text":"So fast and so good! The crust is fresh and thin. They only charge a flat rate for the size of pizza your getting and you can load as much toppings as you want. The cook and the server were EXTREMELY friendly. I highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Service was great and the pizza was pretty good too... The concept is kind of like the do it yourself yogurt shops except pizza. I hope the great service lasts"}
{"text":"Went here in June 2018, ordered online and not online was the great food ready when we walked in the door, the service was great!"}
{"text":"Good but not the best pizza I have had. The service was quick and super friendly however. I'm a big pizza snob so others might actually really enjoy this place. I got the Sophie but added spicy Italian sausage. The \"no name cake\" was delicious."}
{"text":"Really great pizza here! Finally a great pizza place near work! Build your own! Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Good, fresh pizza place with high-end flavors! Vast ingredient selection at a reasonable price. The fire baking adds a good flavor to the crust. Pizza and beer make a great combination. Price is spot-on for the good quality and good service.  The workers all seemed to enjoy themselves and kept the energy of the restaurant positive."}
{"text":"This a great concept.  Unlimited fresh toppings. Three pizza sizes to choose from. The MOD size is perfect for a hungry adult.  Infinite combinations. Service was top-notch. Place was impeccably clean.  Discounts for active/retired military and public servants."}
{"text":"Soooo good! Great price. Love picking my own pizza!   My family eats at MOD all the time."}
{"text":"This was my first time here Latoya and staff were Amazing, they are very welcoming and I didn't see Cream Soda Latoya found it and made my night btw the pizzas were beautiful and fast! I'll be back next time I'm on this side of the world!!!"}
{"text":"Love coming here with my wife and kids. Everyone gets their own pizza exactly as they want it. The pizzas taste great, the employees are always friendly, and the prices are fair. A go-to spot for my family since everyone loves it!"}
{"text":"This is my second time at this location. Great service. Delicious, fresh pizza. Prices are very reasonable as well. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place presents itself well, and the food was decent, but the service was not good from almost every employee I encountered in there. The first guy seemed like he wished that he wasn't being bothered by customers. The young lady that helped me next never even looked up at me while she rushed me through the ingredients with the constant \"what else?\". I got down to the end and the guy checking me out and firing the pizzas was nice. I'm glad I got it to go, because although my experience at the restaurant wasn't good, at least the pizza tasted good."}
{"text":"MOD is a fantastic pizza place where you can build your own pie at a reasonable, flat price. We usually go to the one at Metro Center but this one is a lot closer to our area. We came by this location on the staff's training day and all was great. My MOD typically includes chicken, veggies and feta or Gorgonzola cheese. Try the flavored juices... So good as well!   This area really really needed a MOD so I wish them the best! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Thanks for hooking us up! Great service & nicest workers.. Has nondairy cheese that is yummy! & offers student discounts. AWESOME PIZZA :)"}
{"text":"I believe MOD pizza is a chain BUT my family and I enjoyed this. We went here for lunch after spending the morning at a park with the kids for a Kids Building Wisconsin event and we were starving by the time we got there. There was a bit of a wait due to a staffing issue but by the time the other staff came out, things really picked up. I forget the name of the pizza we got but it had chicken and Gorgonzola cheese on it, very delicious and tasty. The kids shared the personal size pizza with canadian bacon and pineapple. The prices were very reasonable for freshly made pizzas!"}
{"text":"Came here all hungry after a long road trip. Great choice from the birthday girl!   MOD stands out for me among the rest of the fast gourmet pizza concept chains. I think they have just better topping selections. And, they don't shy away loading them onto your pizza. I glad it's not weighted!   My masterpiece was the Tristian with basil, roasted corn, roasted Brussels sprouts, roasted pineapple, roasted corn, spicy Italian sausage, Mama lil pepper, and many many more; just like a buffet on a pizza. The best part is they have so many roasted ingredients.   I never had a bad service experience at MOD. They were always so friendly and attentive. Especially, the team here at this location. They really went above and beyond. At the check out, I just briefly mentioned birthday, they took the initiative and surprised us with a cinnamon dessert pizza for us. You guys rock!!!"}
{"text":"ok,  not quite pizza bianco,  but not fired pie either..  Cafeteria style pizza creating,  at one price per size and not per topping...   sauces: bbq,  white, regular,  pesto or garlic.   cheeses: mozzerela,  feta,  asiago,  gorginzola,   meats n vegies looked fresh,  mosr grilled/roasted.   MOD size,  i got pesto n garlic for sauce,  mizzarela cheese,  chirizo n bacon for meat,  mushroom,  onion n banana peppers veggies,  add asiago..   will be back.  often.  customer service was very good,  very nice n cheery without any fakeness..  congrats."}
{"text":"Nice Selections and FRESH toppings,,,, I get pesto in with the red sauce,, nice finish to it !! this is equivelant to Fired Pie,, but I like MOD just a tad better !!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, but waited to leave a review so that I could see how consistent their food was. At a similar concept I noticed it was super hit or miss. So far on multiple visits this place is solid all the way around. Staff is always super friendly and accommodating.   There are tons of toppings to make your own masterpiece, but they also have some pre selected pies you can choose from. I've personally never had one off the menu, but have been with people who have and they are great.   I absolutely love their Caramelized Pear Ice Tea and wish I could buy it by the gallon."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try the new mod pizza that opened up by my house and unfortunately my first time will definitely be my last. the pizza was burnt to a crisp on the bottom and tasted awful! very disappointed..."}
{"text":"The pizza I ordered was pretty decent. The ingredients were fresh, which is a plus for the indian trail area since we mostly have low quality fast food chains.  The restaurant was clean with very  family friendly atmosphere. I think if they added a touch of seasoning to pizza before going into the oven that would be even better. But I would come back again with my family.   I liked the portion size for children as well"}
{"text":"Me and my dad went here this evening for dinner and were totally amazed. We both created our own pizzas and there was a wide assortment of toppings to choose from. There was also pizzas on the menu that you can choose from if you didn't want to create your own. We also ordered a side of the cinnamon sticks. They were so tasty and a great way to end our meal. Everything was well priced. We paid about $20 for 2 pizzas, dessert, and drinks! The staff was great and incredibly kind and courteous. Not to mention the music they were playing was super awesome. We will be coming back and bringing friends and family!! Thanks for a great experience Mod!!!"}
{"text":"Our team went for lunch and this was my first time. We got there a little before noon on a Monday and it was pretty empty but was surprised that they only had 1 rep making teh pizzas and 1 rep in the back managing the oven.  Half the team ordered mini pizzas and customized their mins but a few of us ordered regular ones..I ordered the regular 11 inch Dillon James (veggie with asiago cheese, tomato, basil) but added pineapple to the pizza as well. Waiting in line for the pizza took longer than them cooking it and eating it, honestly. but for $8 it was a tasty lunch.  It was a pretty quick lunch once they took our orders and will come back. Is it tastier than sauce? No, but it is less expensive and a quicker stop."}
{"text":"Ordered to go and it was ok.  Pizza was fresh out of the fire oven when we got it.  Nice service.  We'll have to eat in next time and see if it's better tasting."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite pizza place on the west side! I will continue to patronize this restaurant. They have a variety of pizza toppings and crust options."}
{"text":"Love love love this place, the build your own wood fire pizza is great & cheap. Also love that they have their own amazing unique ice tea and shakes. It's so fun there!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for an early lunch having never heard of this place before and I was utterly impressed to say the least. I had the barbeque chicken pizza and it was perfect! The sause was tangy, the chicken was perfectly tender and the cheese was on point! Everyone knows though, it's all about the crust when it comes to pizza. Outside of New York, there are few places I would say anything positive about their crust but MOD nailed it again. The atmosphere is pleasant and the ladies who were working when I went in were cordial and efficient, though not overly friendly...it was early so they were probably just getting into the grove of things.  Quick and easy, delicious and fresh!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad we finally got a good restaurant in Steele Creek! I love the build your own pizza and you can't beat the price. They give you so many toppings that the mini pizza is more than enough food for one person. You can't find a better dinner for less than $5. Their blackberry lemonade is absolutely delicious! Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients,  friendly staff, great things crust pizza!   Came in for lunch, will be back.  Love the sweet peppers and roasted garlic."}
{"text":"AWESOME pizza place. Let's start with when you walk in, all the staff members welcome you, total plus if you are like me and those things matter. You get to see all the ingredients, kinda like subway or chipotle only its for pizza or salad. You can add anything you want for the same price. Also, if you come with a family or have a larger stomach to fill, try the mega size. It's two of the mod size pizzas on top of each other. The bottom pizza is cheese and the top is anything you want. If you are a pesto fan, add it to your piZza !!!!  In addition, they have a sauce called the sriRancha it's sriracha sauce and ranch mixed. I was a little weary of it but OMG! So good. It's a perfect mix of spicy and ranchy lol! Next, I tried the cookies and cream milkshake. Normally I wouldn't order a milkshake but he got me when he said it was made with oreos. Holy smokes, so good. Especially for someone who doesn't like milkshakes! Last thing, do I recommend? YES! YES! YES! YES! This is my third time in a week, let's just say when I like a place, I will be back several times."}
{"text":"This place was good. You get to custom build your pizza and no toppings cost you additional money!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I have ever had!!!!   Pick a suggested pizza or select the toppings, sauce and cheese of your choice.   Unbeatable- been a fan for years.  TIP - they can get a little busy at dinner so call your order in if it's to go and you can pick it up when you arrive.   Best pizza in AZ!"}
{"text":"I ordered online for pick up on a busy day and I was so satisfied to see a pizza box on my desk after a long meeting. My co worker grabbed it for me and I dove right in. I had a paleo pizza as I like to call it. Gluten free pizza crust, lots of veggies, ground beef, pesto, dairy free cheese and i loved it!!! I could not tell you how happy I was and pleased with the quality of pizza. Didn't even taste like a \"healthy\" pizza. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza at a great price! MOD is perfect for those that love to load up their pizza with toppings, because you can add as much as you want, without paying extra for any toppings! I also love how customizable it is, and how you can choose different sauces or cheeses on either sides of your pizza. This makes it great to share, or great to just have on your own with some variety! It's also ready SUPER fast, and everything tastes even better with their balsamic drizzle as a dipping sauce!"}
{"text":"Just heard about this place today, and I had to try it.  Very GOOD pizza, and at a great price.  Unlimited topping, no charge.  Cant beat that.   And the staff is amazing.  Will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"First timer. Very friendly. Nice atmosphere. Wish toppings were cooked/browned more. Thats just the way these places cook their pizza. Three sizes and one price no matter how many toppings. That's pretty decent. Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"I came here with my nephew! Super excited to have lunch. Until something bad happened. I have salad with moving. There was a grasshopper in my salad!!! Yes. You read that right. I freaked out.  I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to scare the customers in the restaurant. So I nonchalantly grabbed the bowl of salad and brought it up to the front. I showed her. She automatically apologize. Took the bowl and gave me a free coupon for my next meal. I don't want a free coupon. I'm appalled... Does this mean they don't wash their salad?"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience! The entire MOD team is great! We enjoyed the food, music and conversation - Thank you MOD"}
{"text":"This was good, I secretly didn't want it to be good though. I often have a resistance to restaurant chains, but Mod Pizza is good and healthy apparently.  I ordered their \"Dillon James,\" which is basically a Margherita Pizza. However once I saw they had Pesto. I thought I can have a fancy cheese pizza anywhere. So I decided, I must seize this pesto pizza moment. Sadly enough pesto pizza is becoming an endangered entree.  So I played with the Dillion James recipe by subbing and adding with a caption cloud above my noggin of me wearing a lab coat, safety goggles and holding beakers looking smart and such. The red sauce..gone, in is the pesto and tagging along was his friend ricotta.  Washed it all down my gullet with a pompous craft draft San Tan Devils Ale and it just couldn't stop there. I also had a pretentious can of San Pellegrino Blood Orange bubbly agua. This pizza deserved the beverage theatrics. I'm like this most of the time dining out....okay all the time, Happy now!!  I do what I want, and what I want is bespoke craft pizza....deal with that.!!!  Stay Calm and Dine On."}
{"text":"If you are a pizza purist, you STILL might love this place.   I'm a NY native and pretty picky about my pizza. So, if I want the \"real thing,\" I have to get on a plane, or go to one of the few places that get it pretty close.   MOD is not trying to be that kind of place. Rather, they give you EVERY choice you could want on a thin crust style in just a few minutes.   Think of this like a certain sub shop or that burrito place that hollers welcomes when you walk in the door...only with PIZZA!!  They have some pre-designed pies, or you can tell your pizza production person EXACTLY what ingredients you would like to add to your pie.   When customers enter, everyone proclaims an enthusiastic \"Hello!\" Or \"Welcome!\" They wave and smile like you are a long lost friend. Some customers even get in the act and holler greetings, too (we did). It's hard not to smile with all that love floating around.   A group from work went for lunch. Since the pies are personal size, we could each get what we wanted and even share/taste each other's creations if we wanted.   For my first time, I decided to go with a pre-designed menu item, so I had the Calexico. Appropriately spicy, it was just what I was looking for. Next time I'll be brave and design my own.  Our group decided that we'll definitely go back for lunch soon."}
{"text":"Such a big fan of this place and wished much sooner. Always so fresh great prices and extremely flavorful Pizza. The ability to create your own is and I love that thin crust."}
{"text":"Crust turned to a cracker. Water tasted like Powerade residue.  Staff all called me \"dude\"."}
{"text":"Sooo good. You can choose however many toppings you like, you can also add extra cheese which is awesome (and needed!)!!! Amazing flavor on the standard Mod pizza. However, I wouldn't recommend their thicker version. Would give a 2 star. It just doesn't taste that great. A little undercooked, and also it's too little cheese on a thicker pizza like this. Their specialty is definitely the thin crust which is awesome. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Tried to go to a different pizza place (they were closed today), and wound up here.  I had been to the MOD down on Peoria Ave. a handful of times, and had always liked it for a quick, do it yourself type pizza joint.  I decided to stop in to this newer one today for lunch.  I walked in and was greeted immediately via the \"Hi, welcome to MOD\" all employee \"hello\".  I knew how the concept worked already so I ordered myself a MOD sized pizza with red sauce and mozzarella.  About that.......Not sure if there was a rookie making my pizza or what.  She layered on the skimpest layer of cheese I have ever seen.  It was barely visible!  I politely asked her to put on more cheese and she gladly did.  I went down the line and went with pepperoni (also skimp...she only put like 6 pieces on the whole pizza!), some red onions, garlic, and my favorite topping here, the roasted garlic!  At first, she only put on about 4 pieces of roasted garlic and then I told her to hook it up and add way more.  I wound up with about 12 chunks of roasted garlic when all was said and done.  I asked for it to be cooked well done, paid for my pizza and drink and took a seat.  Here is how it was...........  Pizza-  It is your own creation.  If it is bad, that is your own fault!  My pizza came out perfect!  It was a little charred on the edges due to the \"well done\" request, and tasted great!  The crust here is a tad thinner than other similar style pizza joints, but it still holds up well.  My toppings were great!  I LOVE the roasted garlic!  By far my favorite topping that they offer.  I finished my 4 slices and was very satisfied.  Lemonade-  Hands down, the best lemonade I have ever had from a restaurant!  So simple, yet so delicious.  Just tart enough, but not enough to make your face pucker.  They have 2 kinds, regular and marionberry.  I had a marionberry at first and while delicious and better than 90% of lemonades out there, the OG lemonade was the shining star.  I had 4 cups full of that stuff while I was there, and took one to go, too!  It is SO DAMN DELICIOUS and sweet, and refreshing!  This is coming from a person who rarely ever drinks lemonade too.  The fact that I had 5 cups of it should say something!  I would come here JUST for the lemonade. Yeah, it's that good!   Overall, I enjoyed my lunch!  My only complaint was the light toppings from the get go.  Hook that shit up to begin with, please!  Besides that small snafu, I really like this place because it's reasonably priced ($10.67 for a pizza and drink), fast, tasty, and that lemonade is absolutely a game changer!  I can definitely see myself coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I have been to other places like this, but I hadn't tried out MOD, yet.  I have been down this way a few times to get frozen yogurt at Menchies, and MOD has always peaked my interest.  My buddy in Orange County has also mentioned this spot to me a few times.  I figured that it was time to check it out!  I walked in and was asked if I had been there before.  I replied with, \"No.\" and was given a quick rundown.  Pretty much the same as the other \"create your own pizza places\".  They had a mini, a regular and a double size. They have preset pizza combinations, or you could make your own.   I went with the regular size with red sauce, cheese, pepperoni, meatballs, onions, roasted garlic cloves and regular minced garlic.  My main objective was to keep vampires away and to have some super kicking breath for my coworkers when I returned from lunch.  Mission successful! ;-)  My pizza and a fountain drink came out to just over $10.00.  Not bad!  Here is how everything was..............  My Pizza Creation-  If your pizza doesn't taste good, that's on you!  You picked out the toppings!  My pizza looked delicious once it came out of the oven.  The bottom had a nice char and the crust of the pizza was delicious.  My combo of pepperoni, meatball, onion and 2 kinds of garlic was fantastic.  The roasted garlic was soft and sweet, the regular garlic was pungent and delicious!  They use a crumbled type meatball here and they tasted great.  The onions were of the sliced red variety.  Plenty of pepperoni, too! The cheese was good but would have been better if it were a fresh mozzarella.  It was a bit soft and probably could have been cooked an extra 30 seconds to brown up the cheese.   The only other beef I had with this pizza was that the dough was a bit \"sticky\".  When I bit into my pizza, a few times, the dough sort of separated.  It was like the toppings were floating on top of the crust instead of being baked/sealed in with the crust.  Nothing major, just something I noticed.    Drink-  They have fresh brewed lemonade!  2 kinds, too.  Regular and marionberry!  Crushed ice, and a cold refreshing lemonade hit the spot!   They were both good, but the regular one was a tad better.    Overall, I was happy with my meal.  Service was good, pizza was good, price was very fair and it's not too far from work.  It's not as good as Fired Pie IMO, but its still a mighty fine, quick lunch for around $10.00.  I'm sure I will be back sooner than later."}
{"text":"I had been to the MOD Pizza on Peoria a few times before, and really liked it.  I was in the mood for some pizza, but I didn't want to drive too far from Surprise.  I saw that they had a MOD in Goodyear so I decided to head on down.  I walked in and there were a couple of people ahead of me.  They were taking their sweet time ordering and trying to be \"cute and funny\" with the staff.  They were making up fake names for their order etc.  Just lagging.  The lady working at the joint was taking it in stride.  If it was me behind the counter, I would have been pissed and would have wanted to yell, \"Hurry the fuck up, quit trying to be \"cute\" and just tell me what you want\".  Anyways....after they were done placing their order, I was up.  I went with my usual for the most part.  MOD size, red sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, meatball, tons of roasted garlic, regular garlic, onions and roasted red peppers.  I added a drink, paid the lady my money, asked for my pizza to be cooked \"well done\" and was on my way.  A few minutes later, my pizza was ready.  Here is how it was..............  Pizza-  When I went to pick up my order, the guy explained that he got it as well done as he could without burning it.  I appreciate that!  The only problem with that though, is that it wasn't really that well done lol.  The bottom had a nice char to it, but the toppings were still in tact and the cheese wasn't browned at all and the pepperonis didn't curl up.  If they could design one of these pizza ovens to have a broiler type flame up top, that might work better.  The crust/bottom was well done, but the top could have used some direct heat.  Anyways.....I took my pizza outside and dug in.  This thing almost fell apart immediately.  In my other review, I stated that MOD's dough is a little more \"wet\" than other create your own pizza places.  This dough today was barely foldable and started to separate both at the bottom crust AND where the toppings were.  I picked up my first slice and the toppings kind of slid off and water starting collecting on the metal pizza tray.  Meh.  Flavors were still great...I love that they have roasted garlic cloves.   The overall pizza itself though was just alright.  It was super messy to eat, and that crust coming apart was lame.  The other MOD on Peoria is way better!  Lemonade-  Damn Gina!  This is the best lemonade I think I have ever had.  They use a nice crushed ice, too.  Both the regular and the marionberry are great.  I alternated between the 2 flavors and must have had at least 4 full glasses full plus took one for the road.    Overall, todays meal was decent.  The lemonade was great as usual, but the pizza left a lot to be desired.  I don't think I'm driving back down to this MOD again, but if I was hungry, and in the area, I would come back and see if it were any better.  Service was friendly and the price is right (Just over $10.00 for a pizza and drink).  Just wish this pizza held up a little bit better!"}
{"text":"New place in Fitchburg that is a must !!!   By far one of the best small restaurants around (pizza joints) with an incredible proud and energetic staff.    Walk through the door and you are immediately greeted by the vibrant staff.  This is a build your own pizza concept.  Start with type and size of crust, choose your sauces , and then move on to the cheese and toppings.  It doesn't matter how little or large amounts of toppings you put on...its all the same price.  Pizza is placed and cooked in an open fire pit for about 2-3 minutes.    There are also last minute sauces to add (if you choose) after the pizza is retrieved from the fire pit.  There are 6 choices and located at the end of the final prepping area.    Try it, guaranteed you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pizza was okay.  It seemed to take forever.  It was in the evening and staff seemed tired and burned out.  I think they were understaffed.  I thought it took a lot longer than it should have to get my order going.  I only had a small pizza with a few toppings.  Other people who got there after me were served first."}
{"text":"I came here for a quick lunch.  The pizza was good.  I got my usual: just cheese and onions and extra sauce.  I tried their flavored lemonade, and it was very good.  I was in and out with my to go box really fast.  I would definately come back!"}
{"text":"Only pizza I will buy now. Place is great .. Solid menu or build your own. Employees are super friendly. Been there about a dozen times and always satisfied."}
{"text":"Love the idea of MOD. Great option when everyone wants pizza but everyone likes different toppings. Nice employees. They have a nice selection of lemonades and teas at the drink fountain, a bunch of cool stickers that are free, outdoor seating, and good parking."}
{"text":"the sign screams MOD \"SUPER FAST\" which is a bummer and false advertising. Because it's anything but fast. In fact, it's very slow. And then, our breadsticks & pizza came out thin & cold. I'd be more forgiving, but the expectation was an in & out and then we sat around forever in line and then waiting for our pizza, and it wasn't worth the wait. The create your own & pile-on concept is great for different tastes in the family, but that's about it."}
{"text":"I met Ricky at the bank.  We started chatting, next thing I know I am ordering 2 pizzas.   They were great. My husband was very happy.  Great meeting Ricky and YoYo.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Design your own pizza with as many toppings as you want. Service was fast and the food was delicious. I would definitely get it to go because seating isn't the best. We haven't tried the salad but it is on our list to try. Definitely recommend this!"}
{"text":"Great place for our family. We can order pizza, or a salad however we want. It is fresh and great staff. Its affordable, and the iced tea is phenomenal!!!"}
{"text":"This place falls in line with the growing trend of made to order and personalized individual entrees. It's the chipotle or subway of pizza restaurants.  Overall, much better than expected and I'd put it up there with any of the better pizza by the slice places around town.  The crust is very thin and crisp, and the ingredients taste fresh.  The red sauce had a nice taste, but did not overpower the pizza."}
{"text":"The best pizza place ever. You get any topping you can think of for a low price. Very friendly environment, clean and fast! Would definitely recommend to any pizza fan"}
{"text":"I feel like they are a little skimpier on the toppings than blaze pizza, and I wish they had the GF crust option, but otherwise it was fast, yummy, and cheap! I think the pizzas (mod size) are even a little bigger here than at blaze, which means more for me to take home!!"}
{"text":"Ordering process is somewhat slow. They make the pizzas for each person. There were a few people in front of us and seemed like it took a while. If your in a hurry and this place has a line I would recommend somewhere else. Other wise if you have the time it is worth the wait. Staff is very friendly. One price no matter what you want on your pizza is pretty cool also. Once you get threw the ordering process the food does come out pretty fast. It all looks very good and the taste is very good also. Everything taste very fresh."}
{"text":"Great idea, poor execution.  For the price, you can get a regular pizza at other chains vs the one at Mod that would only feed a 10 yr old.  We were very disappointed with the value and quality.  Thank. God we had a coupon for one of them free."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!! I came here on opening day and twice since then and haven't had a bad experience yet. The concept is personalized pizzas and the best part, they are all the same price no matter how many toppings you put in them. They have pre-designed pizzas and you can modify as yo like or just start from scratch. I have had the Calexico and the Caspian and both were excellent. I also had the Ella which is a limited local option. I usually am not a fan of thin crust but this is light and crispy. You can also get the option of putting different swirls of sauce of on top after it has finished baking. The only negative, I wish they had a rewards program because I will be coming back a lot!"}
{"text":"First time here and fantastic!!! Perfect for families because each child can create their own pizza!!! My very, very picky 11 year old son ate everything and just loved it! Best thing... Individual pizzas are just $5.00!!!  Great family place.... Great pizza... Staff is very friendly!!!"}
{"text":"It's interesting how the restaurant world works, isn't it? A few years ago all the hype was burgers, burgers, burgers... And so the fast casual Smashburger, Five Guys, Burger 21 (since closed), Elevation Burger, Shake Shack, Freddy's and on and on we're born. Before that it was the Burrito and now the restaurant fortune tellers have spoken and have decided that \"create your own personal Pizza\" is the new rage. And so Fired Pie, Pieology, Blaze, PizzaRev, Pie Five, The Pizza Studio & MOD Pizza and others have jumped into the pizza pool together. This location is situated in a mini restaurant row. Burgers, bakery, burritos & sandwiches are all located in the same center. Great if you're with a group & not everyone is feeling the craving for pizza. C & I decided to give MOD a try. The first thing that struck me was the background music. It was loud. We told our \"assembler\" we had never been to MOD before. He didn't seem interested. Since we've been to the \"other\" build your own pie joints it didn't take but a nano second to figure out our game plan. C ordered the Mad Dog ($7.47). This pie had Mozzarella, Pepperoni, Sausage, crumbled Meatballs & red sauce. The crust was thin of course and cooked nicely. A few burnt spots but that is to be expected. All in all a decent little pizza BUT nothing special. Nothing that C said would make him choose this place over any other. I had the MOD salad ($7.47). Basically the \"create your own\" salad here. Fresh Romaine with some yummy toppings. Everything was good but again, nothing special. If we're in the neighborhood & looking for a decent personal pie &/or salad, we'll come back. Average pizza, average salad, loud music, fair prices, ? Staff; 3 Stars"}
{"text":"Kinda disappointed, I was super excited to try especially because all the topping choices however I felt the taste was very blan. Burnt thin crust no flavor with very little sauce. Concept is awesome but missing favor."}
{"text":"I've gotten a few take out orders from MOD pizza before that my boyfriend picked up, but yesterday was the first time that we stepped inside to eat in and I was pleasantly delighted at how refreshing the interior of MOD pizza is.  When I stepped in, I was unclear where the line started, but it's snakes around starting from the left and then swings around right in front of the fresh ingredients behind the glass counter before reaching the cash register located on the right corner.   There was a bit of a line when we went but this gave us enough time to look at the huge menu of select classic pizza combinations that are recommended on the wall. Also, you're more than welcome to pick one of three size pizzas (or salad entrees) and put as much toppings on it, all for the same price! Definitely recommend getting the MOD (medium/standard) size, feel to to size up or down definitely on how hungry you're feeling.   I ordered a BBQ based mozzarella pizza with pepperoni, salami, bacon, green peepers, mushroom, diced tomatoes, parmesan and topped with BBQ swirl and it was delicious! The crust is crunchy & thin-which I like, and I could say the mushroom could be cooked a little more if it was more evenly spread. Otherwise, it was still edible and I didn't mind it all that much.   Very neat, clean and organized inside and I would  definitely come back again! Highly recommend to check this out if you're around the Fitchburg area!"}
{"text":"BLAND pizza, I literally got every veggie on my pizza and there was no flavor to it. There seemed to be no cheese and I couldn't taste any sauce. We ordered basic salad, which had awful stinky cheese and gooey red peppers. The greens and dressing were room temperature. I've had better salads at Wendy's and Mods salad was $8!!!! Based on flavor alone the salad should have been $2.  The counters where they build the pizzas are also disgusting, toppings everywhere and nobody bothering to clean up.   I'm shocked that this is the type of pizza place in the Arcadia area.  Please go to pizza studio if you are looking for fast, build your own pizza."}
{"text":"The idea behind this business is great.  You can choose from their list of pizza options or you can build it as you go, Subway style and end up with a personal sized pizza.   I went with just choosing one of their options as I am not very picky.  Next time I go will probably just choose a different option so that i can get a good taste of everything they have to offer.  Overall the pizza was pretty good, I wish they had more crust options as it seems that all of the MOD pizzas come in thin crust.  If they do come in a thicker crust option, we were not asked or told about it."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, I was blown away!! The flavors are phenomenal!! It's $7.87, period and you can put any toppings on you want, including extra cheese! They even have herbs, like fresh basil and rosemary. Everything is fresh, and it's baked in a pizza oven...not greasy at all!! So yummy!! We're definitely coming back here!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed picking my own personal pizza ingredients. Pizza is cooked in brick oven and is very tasty. Salads are made over a pizza crust and really good too. This is a great concept and idea for a pizza place."}
{"text":"Their crusts are nice and thin, their prices are reasonable considering how filling the pizzas are and how customizable the toppings are of course, and their pesto is really good. I recommend getting pesto on both the base and as a topping if you like pesto at all. The ingredients are fresh and the service is quick. The only negative is that the pizzas are cut into only 4 pieces, which are too big and the crust is not stiff enough for you to easily eat the pizza New York style. I would recommend that they cut the pizzas in 6 pieces. FYI - we had six adults (one who doesn't eat much and who eats a lot) and three large pizzas was the right amount."}
{"text":"Fresh to death!!!!!!!! The food here is just so incredibly fresh. The flavor is unbeatable. And to top it all off, the employees sprinkle Love on the pizzas every time! Literally! The taste so good, they must be made with Love. I am always greeted with a smile when I walk into this place. Kindness, respectfulness, and bomb ingredients, what more could you ask for in Pizza joint."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and amazing service. I love the fact that the dough is made from scratch. Byop and salad. Keep coming back for more."}
{"text":"Wow, this is really really good! I actually like the smaller pizza sizes because I can take my family out and we can each get our own pizza rather than bickering endlessly about what will or will not be ordered on the pizza. The quality of the pizza totally exceeded my expectations and I will definitely be back in the future. The only reason that I didn't give it five stars is that they have a very awkward seating arrangement where some tables end up being right next to the line to order. This means that you are eating your food while a group of people literally gawks at you from mere inches away. Just don't sit anywhere near the waiting line and you will be fine."}
{"text":"Frequent customer, can't complain about making your own pizza!  Excellent service and fresh food!"}
{"text":"MOD is a great idea for getting pizza - modeled after the likes of Subway, Chipotle, and the like.  Order the type crust you want and then add the sauces, toppings, and seasonings as you move down the assembly line watching your pizza become customized exactly to your liking!  I like to think of myself as an adventurous person.  So, naturally, I started with the Jasper, a classic MOD pizza... but then I made it my own!  Extra sauce, cauliflower, roasted corn, extra mushroom, chicken sausage, oh my!  They just kept piling the goodness on top - it looked so good I almost couldn't wait the five minutes or so until my pizza came out the oven piping hot!  I don't like to brag, but... my pizza was a masterpiece.  A true work of tastebud satisfying art.  A magnum opus.  A culinary tour de force!  Now I really do wish that I could take all the credit, but the pizza makers at MOD really made this pizza into the pièce de résistance it was!   I will definitely be back and highly recommend that you stop and check out MOD if you're craving pizza deliciousness!  *****FIVE STARS*****"}
{"text":"I really like this place! The Pizza is terrific and of course as you have already read they allow you to pick out precisely the sauces and toppings that YOU want in a buffet setting.  Everything is really fresh and tasty.They have a very wide array of toppings that you would never expect but love. Also we had a Chicken Caesar salad that was really good! Homemade croutons were very crunchy and favorful, the Caesar dressing was bold and perfect (although we asked for extra which made it way better). First brick oven style pizza that I have ever really liked. Not Wood Burning, but really good. Most of these type of places actually burn the pizza crust and think this is good and trendy.   Only negative was that it was Saturday Night and the atmosphere with the high ceilings was loud and child crazy like Peter Piper's or Chuck E. Cheese with many children running around the restaurant, making noise, and and pretty much out of control. The seating is a bit temporary looking, and they could also use some booths and more decor maybe."}
{"text":"I've never dined in here. I love that I can order online and pick up with no problem.   This place offers quality, thin crust pizza with a variety of toppings at no extra charge. They have great topping combinations on their menu or you can make your own.   Their shakes are really good, and if you dine in, you can enjoy some local beer on tap.   My experience with ordering online has always been seamless. The staff always has it ready on time and are very friendly."}
{"text":"Love this thin crust pizza. Same price no matter how many toppings. Fresh ingredients you choose for your quick-fired pizza. Choose mini or regular. The restaurant has inside and outside seating."}
{"text":"Brought son #4 in after baseball practice. It was his first experience.  He was blown away that you could put as many toppings on the pizza for the same price.  So what does he order?  Pepperoni.  Too funny.  I got a Jasper with - chicken, pepp, hamburger, spicy sausage, feta, kalamata olives, cilantro, mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, asiago and basil.  All on their fantastic gluten free crust.  Delicious!!!  Friendly staff.... clean restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been anxiously waiting for this location to open so I am super lucky that I was able to go in today for their friends and family day. The concept here is really cool-pick the size you want, tell them what sauce and toppings you want and pay one price. The prices are super reasonable too. They have several sauces and toppings to choose from as well as \"strips\" that you can drip. Garlic for the savory and cinnamon that you can dip in chocolate, strawberry or cinnamon glaze.  The have a drink station that has fountain drinks as well as tea and lemonade. The Marion Blackberry Lemonade was awesome. They also have bottled beverages and wine and beer on top. The beer on tap was Papago Orange Blossom-one of our favorites. We are excited to go back when we can partake. They also have milkshakes.  The food itself was very good and I really liked the crust. It's thin but was crispy and delicious.  This is a cool place and I can see us going on a regular basis because we love pizza and the prices are great which allows us each to pick whatever king of pizza we want."}
{"text":"After reading a friend's Yelp review, I decided to try this place. Glad I did! The friendly employee behind the counter did a good job of explaining the choices and ordering process... Much simpler than it initially appears. Given the flat rate they charge, depending on the crust size, I liked how I was able to order as many toppings as I wanted. I with with the \"mod\" size, with is their 11\" or \"medium\" and chose to build my own. All the toppings are clearly labeled and arranged in a logical order, to simplify the ordering process. After all the toppings are added, you pay and they place your pie in the oven; they'll call your name when it's ready. If you like tea, try their caramelized pear iced tea... I kept getting up for more.  I found the atmosphere very inviting. It must have been 107° outside, so the 70° temp inside was a treat. A good selection of alt and new wave music played overhead. There was even a sign in the restroom letting you know where you could stream MOD music online! Overall, MOD Pizza had friendly, and inviting feel. They are based out of Seattle and it shows! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Was greeted right away by Yasmeer! Super good customer service and excellent pizza. I like the fact you can build your own and put whatever toppings you want on your pizza. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Our first trip to MOD Pizza will be our last trip unfortunately. Three of us went in and ordered various size pizzas on the created their own all three came out burned on the bottom and the top was a little black on my onions especially. This tells me that the temperature of their grill is too high. Unfortunately I just didn't see them outweighing any other pizza companies even though their price is much lower. I think I'll stick to traditional pizza in the future."}
{"text":"Good food, decent vibe.  Upon arrival, i had to wait a few minutes. The staff behind the counter spent a lot of time talking and not much time noticing I was ready to order. Once the workers noticed I needed to order, they were fantastic. Very polite and finish.   After order, the food came out in under 10 minutes.  Good assortment of fountain drinks. I told the cashier I didnt want to pay for a soda, so he just gave me a cup for free to fill with soda as I pleased.  Overall decent restraunt, but service staff need to be more attentive to guests."}
{"text":"MOD pizza is my all time favorite place to eat! Everyone her at santan mod makes me feel so welcome! They cook my mad dog with Gorgonzola perfectly!!! I LOVE it here!!!! Thank you mod! When ever I leave, I leave with a happy tummy and a smile on face"}
{"text":"The concept is great; the dinning area is open and bright, but it's not your typical pizza parlor experience. The lay out felt like I was at Chipotle, I use Chipotle for my example because their ingredients are fresh just like MOD. The pizza wasn't bad but it wasn't my idea of good pizza either, all great pizza has to have a great crust and even though MOD customizes each pizza to order I was waiting for the fluffy crusty crust that I love after eating a slice. To me a great pizza should have that circling each pizza pie and MOD fell way short on that. I didn't give this place 4 stars because their pizza has no crust and because it felt like I've had this pizza already, as an appetizer or something at an actual restaurant."}
{"text":"MOD is one of those chains....you know, the build your own pizza type chain. They seem to be everywhere recently. What makes them stand out? They're fabulous customer service! I brought students here one day, and their service was great. They were patient and understanding. On top of that, the pizza was good, and the portion was huge (especially for the price). The second time I went to MOD was for their teacher appreciation event.... they flat out gave away pizzas to teachers.....that was such a nice gesture. Gotta love a company that gives back to the communities they serve. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"There's nothing I need to say out of all of these type of pizza places this one is my favorite because the ingredients are fresh and the dough just seems really good compared to the other places the only other place that I like to eat at his Pieology"}
{"text":"My daughter brought home a salad from this place and it was REALLY yummy!! She had a Caesar with added mushrooms. The only thing I didn't really like is that the price was rather high for the size of the bowl. For a medium sized salad and drink, she spent almost $10. For the same price, you can go to Sweet Tomatoes and build your own bigger size salad, you'd also get soup, bread and muffins, and even take it \"to go\". I'll stick to Sweet Tomatoes."}
{"text":"Man, 1st time to MOD Pizza!! It was delicious!! You get to pick the size of your pizza, and all the toppings you want!  I liked that the small pizza was similar to a flat bread! The best part was the balsamic drizzle I requested!!  The Bomb.com!!"}
{"text":"Went to this location for dinner about a week ago. and requested a to-go container for my overpriced \"mini salad\" from the cashier. She looked at me and instructed me to get in line and ask for it ... I let out and ohhh and got in line from what I counted 7 people in front of me. Scanning to see if she would perhaps have a change of heart and just grab one for me since she was not busy at all. (No one was being ringed up mind you) I got frustrated and as I scanned I seen those little pizza boxes near the drink machine. So I got out of the line and grabbed one and made my own to go container pictured below. On my way out the cashier said \"bye have a nice day\" as I put up my hand showing her my now makeshift salad container with a look of indifference on my face as I exited...   Word to management put salad containers on the outside near the drink machine I would hate to bother your staff again with my difficult request to reach me a container to bag up my leftovers ..."}
{"text":"First time in and we were welcomed at the door. Staff was very friendly and pizza was really good. My only complaint was their choice of music that was playing. Would have been a 4.5 stars, but the music was not appropriate for young kids or old people like me. Will try again, but if music remains the same, not a place for kids."}
{"text":"I like this pizza a lot!  It's a great value too. The pesto is fantastic, and whole roasted cloves of garlic are a treat. I feel like I am taking advantage of them by choosing so many toppings, and asking for extra as they assemble it. I have only gone at night when the restaurant was otherwise empty, so speed and service have beem excellent for me. Tip: the default amount of red sauce is not enough. Tip 2: extra crispy is way better.  I hope this place stays open, it's a cool concept (though admittedly not the only place that does this new-ish make your own pizza thing) and great execution. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I really like MOD Pizza, plus the staff is incredibly nice! Okay, a Chipotle-style pizza joint in Gilbert?! Sign me up!  I love that you get to choose whatever you want and the prices are ridiculous for a pretty good sized pizza. The ingredients are always fresh, they're constantly changing things up on the recommended menu, and they even offer gluten-free crust, which isn't always the case for trendy pizza joints.  When they get busy, I can see how things can get a little wonky with getting the right pizza out to the right customer - I ordered a pizza, but they accidentally gave it to someone else with a similar pizza. I ended up getting a replacement pizza immediately, plus they gave me a coupon for 2 FREE pizzas the next time I came in! Great customer service!  - 4 stars for the service, staff, and quality + tastiness of the food.  - Minus a star for their delivery/output system."}
{"text":"Excellent service from start to finish! The pizza game has been modified. Thanks again for the amazing service."}
{"text":"Got a free pizza coupon so tried it.  It was pretty good.  Different options from many other places.   Looked like they make decent salads also."}
{"text":"7.50 for an 11 inch thin crust pizza. Mod is exactly like it's name, made on demand. It was fun being able to pick ingredients and decide how much and what I wanted in my pizza. So many options!!! Plus their super hot oven cooked it really fast so by the time I paid, it was ready to eat. Love the concept, thank you hipsters of seattle!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place! So good and the prices!! The MOD size is perfect for one or shared for two. The ingredients look fresh and our pizza was done in no time. Staff was friendly and attentive. Will be coming back to this place and telling my friends about it."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have been to a build your own pizza place. Already it's good because you get exactly the toppings you want. The crust is cracker thin, just the way I like it. They have 5 different sauces to choose from. several different cheeses and oodles of toppings. After the pizza is assembled the put it in a mega-hot oven and cook it until the cheese is melted and the crust is crispy. The pizza is ready in minutes and ready to enjoy. I will be back to try many more combinations."}
{"text":"I go to this place sometimes for my lunch break. Evem though it's sometimes very busy, it's usually quick to get my pizza prepared and to cash me out. Not to mention...SO MUCH BETTER than Fired Pie."}
{"text":"This is the second location I've been to and this location is awesome!!! Awesome customer service and great location! The shop was also decorated Super cute! Got the cinnamon strips with cinnamon glaze for the first time and they were soooo good!!!! Thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"We hit the jack pot! I got the #9 Caspian pizza...aka best BBQ chicken pizza I've ever had! The wood fire oven cooked the crust to perfection. Then topped with a swirl of BBQ yummmm. In true MOD pizza fashion, I added more toppings with a splash of pineapple.   I have to admit after seeing the construction starting on MOD pizza, I've been impatiently waiting for this place to open. MOD stands for Made On Demand and that's just what you get. Choose from one of their many classic pizza or create your own. You can put as much or as little toppings as your heart desires. We stopped by to confirm they were officially opening tomorrow and to our surprise they were up and going and were having a soft opening. Free pizza for everyone! I already love this place! The staff were informative and friendly. Overall atmosphere was fun. This really is the Salsarita's of pizza."}
{"text":"Wow! It's like Chipotle met pizza. Pick your size, pick your toppings & in 2 minutes in a fire oven... Done & I'm eating yummmm..."}
{"text":"Ugh!  I TOTALLY dropped the ball and have kept this place a secret.    I have been to MOD several times since it's opened over a year ago and have ALWAYS had a great experience!  The staff are amazing!!  They welcome you, interact with you, make you laugh, and in the end make you feel special.  The food is always awesome!!  It's all fresh and you pick the combination of what you want.  The pizzas cook fast and are usually out of the oven before you can get your drink and pick a seat.  You also can't beat the price!    Hands down, this is a GREAT place to stop for a bite to eat!  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I have given this place a couple more tries since my bad experience and had talked to a staff member.They really have done a good job of making sure things are clean, tastly and prepared right. Thanks for listening to my review!"}
{"text":"Pizza was thin and crispy which is ok, but my biggest fear was of the black hair bearded man working on my pizza.  Luckily, no hairs on my pizza."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this customization thing that seems to be taking over. Pick your base, pick your sauce, pick your toppings. Easy!  I chose a classic 11 inch pie with the regular sauce and added chicken, bacon, sweet and hot peppers, red onions and extra Parmesan cheese, Despite all of these toppings, when the pizza was ready it was not wet or drippy at all.  Flavor? Excellent. Crispy crust, well cooked toppings. Coke fountain with lemonade and sweet tea. They also have some OMB and other local beers on tap.  Inside and outside tables."}
{"text":"Very good pizza with unlimited toppings - but price has increased for a mini $5.97 now ..."}
{"text":"I will never come to this location again. Only one nice employee working named Myra, the rest were so rude. I thought I was at Fired pie with how stingy they were with toppings. We frequent the Mod in queen creek and they always welcome you with a smile, they never make you feel rush and will use what ever topping amount you ask for."}
{"text":"My family and I eat at mod pizza frequently. They are always friendly. The service is awesome and the food is great."}
{"text":"The best of the BYO pizza places that I have been to. There are a few more I need to try but so far MOD is number one."}
{"text":"Awesome pizzas and salads are just as good. You can pretty much put whatever you want on either which is great. The concept is a bit confusing if you've never been but the people there are very friendly and patient and walk you through it. I've been back multiple times and it's always light and tasty. Definitely a great spot to grab a bite. Plus they have beer on draft which is always a plus."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and very professional, they take the time to explain what you can get and all of the toppings come with the base price of the pizza. A great experience!"}
{"text":"Good quality pizza with fresh ingredients. You make your own pizza here, so don't even look at the preset menu on the wall. One time I tried to order one of those and the employees kept asking what I want on it (ummm, the things that are listed?!).  They also have a few Old Meck (local) beers on tap. Says $2 draft Tuesdays.   Staff is friendly when you go. They always greet you when you come and go, think Moe's \"Welcome to Moes!\"  Plus there are usually about 15 people working at any given time. Think assembly line concept.   Style inside is modern and sleek. Think concrete floor and rustic wood table.   Overall a great place to eat. Give it a try and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great location, fast service and the pizza was perfect! Second time at this location but it was the first to dine in. Get the Jasper and add roasted garlic, YUM! The kids ate their whole cheese pizza and the salad was good. Very clean location with moderate foot traffic. If you choose to take out or dine in, you won't be disappointed with MOD."}
{"text":"Walked in here knowing it was a BYOPizza place but not much else. The place is pretty cool, priced low / inexpensive, tons of topping options, quick service, a couple wines and beers on draft. Great lunch spot. The shopping complex gets crazy busy most days, try to go on a Sunday when everyone else in the neighborhood is at church ;). 4/5 stars because the music was a little too loud (loved the music selection, just needs to be turned down so you can at least hear them call your name when your pizza is ready."}
{"text":"Clean, good food, great service. The staff is always polite and friendly. It's like subway but for pizza and salad. Plus it's brick oven! They also have the best \"No name cakes\" which is basically a big homemade ding dong, even wrapped in tin foil."}
{"text":"Had this pizza for the first time on 12/11/15. I liked the fact that I could make my pizza the way I wanted it and my wife made hers the way she wanted it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is they gave you a small plastic cup for drinks they do give free refills but it still cost $2 also they were real tight on the topping this might be because it's new but if you are just having a pepperoni pizza you might want to ask for more because they only added 6 to their MOD size(11in pizza). The pizza and staff were very good. They do have an out door seating area that is nice for Az most of the year."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE their pizza and customer service! I am a foodie and this place is right up my alley. This is me and my hubby's lunch spot. I told them it was our first time so they explained the process to us. We all ordered different pizzas so we could share. Fresh toppings and every veggie you can think of. The salads are also very filling. Any pizza can be made into a salad. Wait, there's more. They even have cookie dough shakes!"}
{"text":"Place is delicious! I would have given 5 stars if the ordering process was not overwhelming. So many choices. Quality was excellent. Beer was tasty! Wait was a little long, but since this was my first time I'm sure the folks ahead of us were MOD virgins as well! Love that they let you sample the beer before choosing. Will definitely be back. Oh btw, I thought it was better then fired pie"}
{"text":"Seriously, people! This place is ridiculously awesome. Less than 8 bucks for a big,  ( 11\") amazing pizza, with whatever toppings YOU choose. The staff is always fun, and funny . ( And, yes, I will admit I have been here enough times to say that)   Premium beer on tap at happy hour prices, all the time ( $4.97 draft- currently orange blossom and devils ale) and $2 draft on Tuesdays ( can I get a hallelujah? It's Tuesday, as sit in MOD, writing this...)   I just want to throw out props to the crew running the place tonight. They are a lot of what makes this a great place to be: Dylan and Nick, shift leaders and Kris and Deb, team members. You are all the best. What's not to love?   This is a friendly place , with a nice, atmosphere, and  great music , but not too loud to chat; perfect for meeting friends, family or business casual.  Get over here as quick as you can- you'll kick yourself that it wasn't sooner....."}
{"text":"With the exception of one time they forgot to give me my food while I had been waiting (was carry out order), it is  great pizza place!  The fact that you get unlimited toppings for the same price is AWESOME!  I load mine up and it tastes great!  I stop in whenever I can or when I am in that area."}
{"text":"Cool pizza spot where you can build your own personal pizza on the spot. I walked in about noontime and the line wasn't too bad. Really dug the layout of the place. It's not a large space, but the high ceilings made it feel quite roomy. I can imagine the place running out of tables quickly on busier days, but today it was fine.  Enjoyed creating my own custom pizza, which turned out quite delicious. There are a good number of ingredients and toppings to choose from, most of which is standard pizza fare so it's hard to screw up. They also have recommendations on the wall for the lazy or indecisive.  But seriously, they looked pretty solid, so will have to try one sometime. It'a not a big pizza, and it was out of the fire and into a box in around 5-6 minutes, so it's not a long wait.  For the curious, I did a white sauce and pesto combo topped with cheese, olives, mushrooms, crumbled bacon, oregano and drizzled with olive oil. Yummy. Give this place a shot the next time you crave some pizza."}
{"text":"Nice place cool concept. I just threw a bunch of crap on my pie and and it came out pretty good."}
{"text":"So here's the thing that I want to give my full honest opinion. I was really excited to try the pizza place. I got about five steps in the door before it smelled sour. Sour mixed with cheese and other ingredients smells pretty rank. They were doing construction outside so I thought maybe it was the other place the other businesses don't smelled terrible. I don't know what's going on and I would love to try the food sometime whenever the smell does not smell like that."}
{"text":"We ate there for the first time today and really wanted to like this place. First the good: The food is good and the ingredients are fresh, the staff not so much. Unfortunately, the quality of the food is not good enough to justify the aggravation of the poor staff.   The place was busy with a steady stream of customers. The staff was terribly trained and they had way too many people in the kitchen. We ordered two pies and a salad and it took 40 minutes to get our food. My wife got her pizza a good 10 minutes before i got mine. By the time I sat down she was half way through her meal.   Like i said the food was good, but not good enough.."}
{"text":"This place is a nice addition to the make your own pizza experience.  We were greeted when we walked through with several friendly hellos!  They are super fast too.  As you go through the line you pick all your toppings and they have a huge selection.  My family was finally able to get what they want instead of agreeing to the same toppings on one pizza.  We were getting close to spending $50 so Makayla suggested that we buy the special gift card which is buy a gift card for $50 and get an extra $10.  Our meal was a little over $50 so now I have a gift card to return for the balance.  Pizza was cooked perfectly.  The garlic strips were pretty basic.  Just thin and crispy crust with garlic topping.  Not bad but I preferred the pizza.    Thanks Makayla and team!  This staff is doing its thing!  Making you feel welcome, moving fast, answering questions, providing suggestions and service good food.  Good job management.  Oh and they serve beer on draft and some bottles.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Great 'za! I love a nice crispy crust that lets the toppings shine. Yum! And speaking of toppings...you can't beat being able to choose whatever toppings you want for no additional charge."}
{"text":"Thanks Steven, Julio & Jordon @ MOD PIZZA SCOTTSDALE, AZ. While visiting Scottsdale for Easter weekend, we took our son & grandkids for pizza. Yummy pizza, great service and such friendly staff. When we came here in early December we got the same experience. Now we have a go to place to enjoy a family night out."}
{"text":"AWESOME. One of the best pizzas I've had in a while. One flat price per pizza size, get the toppings you want. Great taste, cooked in a brick oven, great atmosphere, great service."}
{"text":"I love MOD, I've been here a few times now and it's quickly becoming one of my go-to's for pizza. I love the selection of ingredients and the thin crust."}
{"text":"Not pictured are the two slices I devoured before deciding this place needs to be Yelp'd. The staff are really friendly and the pizza was amazing. Chicken pesto with mushrooms, artichoke (and hearts), ricotta, onions perfectly baked is my new addiction."}
{"text":"Beginning with fresh mixed greens salad tossed with house balsamic dressing followed by a Gluten Free house specialty \"Dominic\" pizza.  For Gluten Free dough it was quite tasty and moist and enjoyed the fresh ingredient toppings.  Only gave 3 stars as the wine and beer selection was limited, what was available did not suit our palate :(  Next time water as our drink of choice will do :)"}
{"text":"Great service and delicious pizza. I love the idea that you can modify your pizza any way you want.  I got the Lucy Sunshine and added chicken and it was amazing!  I will definitely be coming back to try more of their pizzas."}
{"text":"I would pick Fired Pie over MOD Pizza. Mod Pizza doesn't have a lot of toppings (or at least the ones I want-- spinach).  It comes out really greasy and they cut an 11 inch pizza into only 4 slices so each slice was huge. We got two pizzas with one that had basil in it. If you check out the picture, there is basically NO basil... And small tiny pinch of basil.  For what it's all hyped out to be, it wasn't great.  Awesome music though! Loving the 70s 80s feel"}
{"text":"Service was awesome and pizza was good! It's thin crust so beware! I appreciate the fact they have daiya cheese as well. The selection of topping was good too. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Queue Taylor Swift!  She wears short skirts, I eat pizza. She's cheer captain and I'm still eating pizza!  *ahem*  So MOD Pizza seems to be everybody's sweetheart so I wanted to give this place a go!  Not bad, MOD, not bad.  The crust is thin and crispy and the toppings are delish.  The workers still seem to be new and some of those pizza artists had to peek at the sign to see what goes on each pizza.  I got a half-and-half on tonight's pie --- half Caspian and half \"Squad Fave,\" Valencia.  I tweaked a bit on my Caspian and added some pepperoni and pineapples because I'm just the kinda gal that enjoys pineapples!  It was great.  I washed my pie down with their caramelized pear iced tea --- refreshing and not too sweet!  Since this place is still new, everything is nice and clean.  There was a non-stop line the whole time we dined in so they must be doing something right.   With a lot of dining options nearby in this excellent strip plaza, this is the pizza joint of choice.  While I'm not willing to replace my other pizza-made-my-way hot spot with MOD, this place is closer to home."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some pizza and passed thus place numerous times on my way to the 17 all the time so I decided to go in. Was a little overwhelmed because I've never been and they have all kinds of fresh toppings and everything. The woman behind the counter was really nice and explained everything, so I began to make my own mod sized pie. Added a small side Caesar salad and strawberry shake to go along with my pie.. the pizza was super delicious and everything tasted fresh. Salad was on point and the shake was damn good as well. I will definately be making more trips to this establishment."}
{"text":"My first visit to a MOD pizza was at a different location and the experience was fun so I decided to try this Tempe Marketplace location while I was visiting. I went in the evening on a Tuesday which wasn't too busy and the two workers helping us were very friendly and definitely made an attempt to talk and communicate with me.   If you're someone like me who enjoys a meaty pizza, here is what I ordered! I chose the MOD 11\" personal pizza which may seem small but when you get to the toppings I chose, you realize how it makes you feel full. I asked for just about every meat (besides anchovies!), jalapeños, pesto sauce, extra cheese (mozzarella) and white sauce as the base. I also added a little bit of the different seasonings they have (salt, pepper, oregano). Overall the pizza was amazing and I asked for extra pesto to be added at the end once it was done cooking and I was very satisfied. If you enjoy pizza and ranch this was a great combo!   Overall, I recommend coming here if you enjoy the idea of customizing your own pizza. I was originally skeptical to try MOD from the start but after reading and hearing just how fun and good they are I'm glad to be a new constant customer!"}
{"text":"This is such a fun restaurant- it's like a subway but for pizzas! The best part is you have unlimited toppings free of any additional charges! I went here for a lunch break and had little time. They are so quick and friendly! I was able to enjoy my lunch and be back to work on time!   Try the asparagus on the pizza, it is amazing! They have a really great berry lemonade and tasty teas. I made a Arnold Palmer with the berry lemonade and it was perfect.   Prices were great too! Not a bad deal for all the great fresh vegetables and quick service!"}
{"text":"I found this place by googling \"gluten free\" pizza. I was skeptical because many places didn't have a gluten free option so I was surprised that they did. The gluten free pizza is super tasty, I think it's a 12 inch. So it's good for 2 light eaters or 1 hungry person. I really like that this place is a flat fee for the pizza and then you can have any toppings you want. Usually places charge for every extra topping. Another cool thing is that this location is really fast, no matter if they are busy or slow, you get your order in under ten min. Perfect for people who are on lunch breaks. The staff is also really sweet! Every person that has helped me was friendly :) I will keep coming back. Oh I almost forgot the best part. They have this lemonade that's made with Marion(not sure how to spell) blackberries  I think.. It's simply divine! I crave it"}
{"text":"Delicious, friendly staff, quick if you are on a tight lunch. Loved being able to build my own fixings from endless choices. Try the balsamic fig they drizzle on at the pick-up station. Yummy. Spouse likes the Caesar salad."}
{"text":"So good, fast, try the fig glaze. So many toppings to choose from. The salad was large enough to share. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Mod pizza is so tasty! I love the sauce here and always ask for EXTRA on my pizza. :) the price is decent and the pizza fills you up! I'm usually a Chicago style crust type of girl, but Mod is one of the only places that I totally dig the thinner crust. The only thing I would change about this place is the customer service. Being that I work in customer service, I strongly admire and applaud nice customer service. Every time I go in, I feel that the employees are somewhat nice but like I'm inconveniencing them, which is why I have it 4/5 stars.   Other than that, Mod is super yummy and I'll continue to go here! :)"}
{"text":"My daughter and I come here very often! She loves the tea and lemonade options ... I love the orange blossom draft! Service is friendly and fast! Pizza is delicious!! I'm addicted to the Calexico Pizza but I swap out the chicken for spicy sausage."}
{"text":"\"But I want a pizza, Daddy, and I want it now!\" Someone give that girl $9 and the directions to MOD Pizza! If you want a quick, fresh, flavorful, custom pizza, then go to this MOD Pizza! The people here are fantastic! I hear that they get the best customer service reviews out of all the MODs in the US! Also, side note, you should look in to MOD's hiring practices and beliefs (pretty awesome if you ask me).   Okay, so the food! If you've never been, think Subway but pizza, and then bump it up like 18 notches. I love being able to pick my own toppings, and they let you pile it on if you'd like. I really love their pizza salads! Look, these won't make it on to top chef, but they beat out all of the pizza chains that I've ever been to.   The vibe here is open, welcoming, upbeat, and fresh. It's like dinner and a mood adjustment! The perfect date in one place!  Update:   Someone great asked me a super question and I thought that you might want to know the answer too!  I was asked if there were any toppings that I would recommend...? Of.Freaking.Course!    Here are some of my faves: balsamic fig finishing glaze, grilled broccoli, grilled corn, pesto on the base and on top (cuz I just love me some pine nut and basil goodness), artichoke hearts, and lots and lots of Kale!! You can also get your salad ON A PIZZA!!!   Can you tell that I'm a fan?!"}
{"text":"Love it! Everyone can get exactly what they want. You get to pick out all the ingredients you want on your individual pizza, and it costs the same no matter how many ingredients you choose. It's fast and delicious. Your pizza only takes 3 minutes to cook. I really like the crust. It's crispy because they bake it quickly in an 800 degree oven.  I ordered takeout online which was awesome because you get to skip the line and go straight to the register to pick up your pizza.  As someone with food allergies, I LOVE that they are completely NUT FREE! I can order with confidence and not have to check all the allergy information! Even their pesto is nut free which is amazing because I love pesto and it is hard to find pesto not made with pine nuts. From their website: \"Our pesto does not contain nuts. Ingredients include basil, canola oil, parmesan, milk, water, garlic and salt.\"  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pizza hut who? Since i have discovered this place this is like my 10th time coming here and i love it. I couldnt even tell you the last time i ordered pizza from anywhere else since i  have discovered mods. The fact that no matter how many ingredients and toppings you put on pizza its the same price they have 3 different sizes the mini,the mod, and the mega! The most expensive sized pizza is $10 yes you heard it right and i generally get the mini its enough for just me to fill me up and its only $4  and some change, well worth it from everything from the fresh ingredients and sauces. You watch them make it as you tell them what you want on your personalized pie!"}
{"text":"20 years in the  food industry i never heard this crap before  me ; i would like a salad girl makes salad puts it on the side than she serves another customer, so im standing there waiting and needles to say the  young with the blond hair not ones turned  around to offer help so i wait and i was on my lunch break ,so i said thr girl can u please finish my salad, omg girl had attitude she said what u want i said  chicken an than she keeps asking what else what else  what else while she literally was THROWING the food  in the bowl at that point i could see she was pissed ,sooo she went from  greens to meat to veggies to cheese with one scooper i looked at her and said so u just touched all this food with one spoon  she said yea i said u know thats contaminating she said oh well everything is contaminating these days but techically its not ...WTF !!! Is  this a damn joke ,i would love to talk to her damn manager, if i was the health department this place would been shut down, iam beyond pissed ,dear manager please pay attention to ur workers if i get sick i be back and u will lose buisness ,customer service is crap and be aware of salmonella ..thats all i have to say"}
{"text":"Tige, Shannon, and Jen were incredible tonight! So accommodating to me with a to-go order when they were getting ready to close (I came in close to 10 thinking they closed at 11 on Friday-- never, ever go to a restaurant close to close. It's common courtesy). They got my order done in minutes and are just genuinely good people, which seems to be a common trend in their team with each of my visits. Get to know them! Especially Heather! She's a sweetheart and what brought me back here in the first place! Also, bad ass pizza. Thank you all! See you again soon!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. If you have kids it's great because by the time you sit down with your drinks and get settled your food is already ready. Delicious and cooked very well. I like that you can get as many toppings as you want for one price"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Quick friendly, knowledgeable about the product, very clean place! First time here we would definitely come again!!! Thank you DEL & ROB!! Cooper/Warner location."}
{"text":"Abby and Nicole ROCK. They made my first Mod experience amazing. I created the pizza but they perfected it. I will only come to this location... (when Abby and Nicole are working)"}
{"text":"exactly what this area needed a top notch make it yourself pizza was just perfect with the soft crispy crust from the oven and great ingredients love this place and glad its here"}
{"text":"If you like a great thin crust healthy pizza then this is your place! Fresh made crust, wide variety of sliced vegetables, fruit and meats as well as a good variety of cheeses . Less than 9 bucks and you will have a happy full belly.   Try the Dillon James 11 inch pie and then add your favorite toppings... the best part is that they cook in the woodfired flat oven and in less than 7 minutes your pizza is ready !    The also have super salads at the same price that can feed up to 3 people . Fresh brewed iced tea and lemonade make a crisp refreshing accompainment to your meal for 2 bucks.    This is an excellent healthy alternative to fast food and I like the atmosphere.  Check em out.  C"}
{"text":"I love this pizza, the setting is good BUT, sorry guys you play the music very loud. I'm not sure if the music is for the patrons (I've only seen families, older folks and not many millennials).  Hopefully someone from your establishment will make a decision to have music as a background element so people can enjoy the pizza, conversation while some nice mix of music is playing."}
{"text":"We love Mod Pizza!  Very good pizza, created to your liking, at a fair price. What more could we want?  Mod Pizza is our go-to pizza joint now"}
{"text":"Pizzas have always been inconsistent since they opened. The other night I had on of the worst! All sauce, hardly any cheese or topping. I understand that you have to watch your food costs but this is ridiculous! When the pie came out I was eating tomato sauce on thin cardboard. There are so many other places for pizza don't waste your time or money going here."}
{"text":"Average pizza.  Very light on the toppings.  Maybe its because unlimited toppings for one price cause them to go light on each one.  Nice place and friendly staff.  Its a good place to grab a light bite,  but don't expect to be blown away."}
{"text":"It's good to know I can get a good pizza made on locally and on demand. low carbs is plus. Customers service was great too."}
{"text":"Fast food that isn't fast food!  The pizza, \"MOD sized\", was perfect for sharing with another person, especially if you get a salad as well.  The pizza is one price, with as much or as little as you want.  We had a \"James Dillion\" pizza with an olive oil base, mozzarella, asiago, spicy Italian sausage, tomato, Brussel sprouts and more.  We had a classic Cesar salad with extra anchovies.  This just can't get any better."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, clean restaurant and fresh ingredients, so many delicious looking items to choose from I was impressed. Ricotta was yummy and all the veggies were bright and colorful. Prices are fair, I only wish the pizza was cooked just a little more, the cheese was still a little thick and the mushrooms still looked raw in color also thick. It was cold by the time I got home so that kinda effected the taste but a quick heat up on the stove helped crisp up the slightly chewy crust."}
{"text":"Tried MOD last week and was not disappointed at all! Looking forward to stopping back again soon!   Ordered two build-you-own pizzas and they both turned out great! One of them had the dairy-free cheese alternative, which honestly wasn't terrible, but also wasn't awesome (and really, the world of cheese alternatives still has a very, very long way to go lol). I would have probably preferred the pizza sans any cheese at all. BUT, that being said, how cool is it that they even offer a dairy-free option?   Ordered online for pick-up. The place was BUSY when I got there, however both pizzas were all set, hot and fresh, ready to go! Perfecto!"}
{"text":"Went here last night looking to try something different and be blown away by the pizza. Well the pizza was great but not amazing, got to say it was nice to pick the way that you want it and even add more to it. Although the guy that was adding the extra toppings barely added the amount that you would really want like Chipotle portions...so next time I think I might ask them to add more. Also if you're expecting thick crust do not bother cause it is all think crust. Okay so something that was good was the blueberry shake...so I definitely recommend all their desserts. Honestly it is a good pizza and I would return."}
{"text":"I was introduced to MOD by my brother-in-law who lives in Tempe and not long after that, a new location near Arrowhead Towne Center opened which isn't far from where I live.  I order online and in about 15-20 minutes I pick up my pizza(s). The quality is great but the thing that really stands out is that it's the same price no matter how many toppings so feel free to load up. The number of toppings available is impressive.  What's preventing me from giving five stars is twice they've messed up my order. They either left off toppings or put hardly enough sauce on my pizza. Once they left off the cheese but that was my fault when ordering but they went ahead and made me another pizza which cheese on it.  The manager has been good about it though and either replaced my order or gave me a voucher for a free pizza on the next visit. The last time this happened they left the tomatoes off my wife's pizza which I didn't realize until I got home. I called the store and the manager said he give me a free pizza next time. Next time I remembered that so I didn't place my order online but went to the store and he comped both pizzas for me.  Sometimes the pizzas aren't ready by the time specified when I placed my order but twice they offered me a free drink even though it was a carry-out order. They've always made things right but it's happened a few too many times for me to give them a 5-star review.  I apparently come here so often that the employees know me by name! Maybe I'm one of only a few that takes advantage of their online ordering."}
{"text":"What a great place. Always greated with a hello and friendly employees when you enter this pizza joint. They seem to put extra effort into welcoming people and making them comfortable with the Made On Demand (MOD) pizza concept. I discovered this place awhile back and have been returning a couple times a month ever since. I tend to be the person, who gets almost everything on my pizza when ordering it made-my-way as encouraged at this place. I have found the spicy chicken sausage a bit too spicy for me at times, however, and add most every other meat topping.  I am also a fan of their free drizzle sauces at the end. I always get at least the balsamic fig sauce. It adds a wonderful tangy taste. Ask for it, and give it a try next time you are here."}
{"text":"Yay, an awesome pizza place has opened in Steele Creek!   It's like Chipotle in the way you build your meal, assembly-line style. They have a menu with about 10 pizzas, but if you want a topping that's not already included, you can simply ask them to add it. I love love love that they don't charge extra for any toppings.   I got the Dillon James because I like simple red sauce pizzas, but added pepperoni and onion. Delicious. The thin crust is crispy and chewy all at the same time.   The vibe is casual but hip. A great place to come with family and friends, or even to grab a bite alone.   I'll definitely be coming here for pizza from now on. Thanks Mod for opening up in Charlotte, especially in Steele Creek!"}
{"text":"Do you like feeling accepted? Welcomed? Wanted?  If you answered yes, you should go dine at Mod Pizza in Fitchburg. I know this is a kind of fast food franchise, but if you want some friendliness with your meal, this is the place to be. Sure, that is not always what you look for in a restaurant, but it makes your pizza way more delicious when everyone treats you like a friend.   Besides the gregarious atmosphere, you should enjoy your Mod for many other reasons.  First, let's discuss options. Mod is made for individual creation. You can make your pizza however you like. Top it with all the meats and veggies you want. Toss some olive oil in the base if you are feeling super Italian. Load it with every cheese available. Put a salad on it. Or! have a simple pepperoni and cheese if it pleases you to do that. I've never been big into the make your own personal pizza restaurants, but Mod does it right. I can be happy with my broccoli and cauliflower pizza topped with a classy fig glaze, while my boyfriend enjoys his meat monstrosity right beside me- everyone is happy.   Second, let's talk about the price.  My pizza is about $5. Sure, it is called a Mini, but that little beastie will fill you up. Do not doubt that Mod Pizza is the best bang for your buck.  For less than $20 you can get 2 pizzas, a drink, and a dessert- shout out to the delish No Name Cakes (also known as a Ding Dong). I am sure that you can't find such affordable quality anywhere else.  Delicious, nutritious (optional), and so easy on your wallet."}
{"text":"We seriously love Mod Pizza. It's a family favorite. My kids love choosing what goes on their pizza, and how much. The staff is outstanding. It's an all-around positive experience for us."}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVE this place. ONLY BAD THING: the last two times I've wanted to go we didn't because it was really hot out and the seating inside is very limited. So I'm just thinking...if they had pull down canvas walls even outside to block the sun and keep a little cooler that would get them much more business in the summer!"}
{"text":"Whenever I visit AZ we always go to MOD. We have a similar concept on the east coast and this one comes pretty close to it. Everyone that works here is really friendly and service is always great. I always create my own and I love how it's one price no matter what you choose to put on it. I also like how there's different sizes available. I wish there were more toppings to choose from though. I love all the drink choices they have. The caramelized pear iced tea is my favorite! Also you can mix the berry lemonade with the unsweetened tea to cut the sweetness a bit. Great concept and you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I don't get it? Why the five stars? Being from NY I know pizza. This is not great pizza. Is it because it is so fast? There is nothing wrong with the place but nothing to write home about either. I think of this place as the McDonalds of pizza. They advertise fast and it is.  I got a Mini Tristan and a salad and a drink and it cost 11 dollars. I don't know. That is not a cheap lunch for leaving hungry and fast food pizza. I did notice on the way out they had these cool looking Ice Teas and Lemonade. I was intrigued by the sound of a Caramel Pear Tea and the Blackberry Lemonade. They were both Delish. I would go back just for those if I was close by.   Another annoyance, the place was dirty. It looked like it had been three months since they dusted the railings where the tables are connected to. ( They have been open for three months) I have to admit the staff members were very friendly. This strip mall has a lot of great options so not sure it will last."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago originally, I've had a lot of outstanding pizza in my life. With that said, it was a great surprise to find MOD...a place where the pizza is phenomenal (my personal favorite is called the Olivia) and the customer service is top notch! I love that you can pick your own toppings to create whatever type of pizza you're in the mood for. They offer my favorite local brew, Orange Blossom, and delicious wine if you like to enjoy an adult beverage with your pizza. There is one individual that stands out named Tige. He is by far one of the friendliest, most helpful people there; always making sure that you have the best possible experience in every way! I highly recommend this MOD location if you're in Gilbert and looking for delicious food and a great atmosphere with super friendly employees!"}
{"text":"I will give this 2 stars only because the staff was very friendly and it isn't their fault the chain makes this kind of \"pizza\".  The pizza though, was garbage.  Cardboard, yet soggy in the center, so despite the small size of the piece, it couldn't hold form.  I love New York style, I love Chicago style, but this is just an affront to true pizza connoisseurs everywhere.   All I felt like I was getting here was ripped off with the amount of food I was given.  Is this a millennial thing that I am not aware of?  Less food, bad food, and pay more for it?  I'd take a frozen pizza to make in my own oven any day over places like this.  Not to mention the uncomfortable stools and chairs."}
{"text":"Love this concept. Great food. Fun staff. Fast service. What more can you ask for?!?!"}
{"text":"The build your own concept or a number of predetermined combination of pizza.  Went there on a Sunday afternoon after church and there were not very many customers but there was an army of employees there which were very friendly but not annoying like the people at the window of Dutch Bros.   I ordered a medium pizza which was $7.47 and you add as many items as you want. I ordered the build your own pizza and I included almost all the meat selections except the Spicy sausage and it was brought out very quickly.  It is served on a plate cut into 4 pieces. The taste was okay.   This is not my favorite make your own pizza place in town."}
{"text":"Love this place! From the cool ambiance to the great staff to the incredible pizza...fantastic. And the gluten free crust is great! Perfect for kids or lunch with girlfriends--MOD is my go-to Gilbert restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, I love the fact that you can build your own pizza. It's like Subway but for pizza and has better quality food. I will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"This place is definitely for thin-crust lovers like me. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Love the unique pizza combinations and gluten-free options. Only negatives would be the lines and lack of indoor seating."}
{"text":"Loved the experience and the two pizza's I picked up to go. Enjoyed the friendliness of the staff and their energy and attitude. I ordered two of their pre-built options so did not experience the build your own but the versions I brought back for everyone were quickly devoured."}
{"text":"Found it!  Delicious gluten free (but not for Celiacs) pizza.  All the toppings you want at one price.  Fast friendly service.  Will be back."}
