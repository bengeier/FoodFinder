{"text":"I don't drink so this is a review of the food only.

Service was OK, but it was pretty dead, so the waitress's attention wasn't exactly split. I ordered the corned beef and cabbage .... and it was bland and the cabbage was overcooked. Seriously, if you're going for an Irish pub, and you can't get corned beef and cabbage right, what are you selling? The person I was with does drink, and she didn't mind the beer; had the same complaint about the food though ... bland."}
{"text":"Meh is right. I want buffalo wings all legs (no flaps!). They said no because it would screw up the proportions of wings to flaps contained within the plastic bag that they get from the food supply company thus creating an unfair condition for the next customer that orders wings. I know, I ask WAY too much from the restaurants that I patronize. But, I like what I like. So the moral of the story is: Don't eat here if you want ANYTHING prepared a little differently. Hey Irish Wolfhound sorry to inconvenience you with my business. The soup nazi lives!"}
{"text":"Just saying. Awsome food.    We love everything . but the fish. The giant fish and chips.  potatoes soup.  and try the sausage rolls .  Ok.    and the staff is amazing.  so there you have it. ."}
{"text":"Great new Irish Sports Bar in Surprise.  The Boys from the 'New Dubliner' have done themselves proud in the land of the Blue Hairs.  Authentic Irish owned and operated and pouring plenty of the black stuff."}
{"text":"Went on Friday for the first time for the fish fry. Must say that the service is great! All the staff was quick to pick up plates & refill our all you can eat. The atmosphere is just like I expected a nice Irish pub with all the decor and drinks! The fish fry was very tasty & I was impressed with the quality of the fish. The chips were a great addition as well. For dessert we had the bread pudding and it was good as well. Sweet but not overpowering just right! Will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Fish and Chips all you can eat!!! Outstanding!!! Very crispy on the outside and moist on the inside not dry! Very flavorful and not fishy tasting. Highly recommended. Very affordable at about $15 a plate for all you can eat fish n chips."}
{"text":"I am not sure what was worse: the service, the loud 50 year old women trying to be young or the fact that a 10 year old was sitting at the bar. Happy hour? More like get me the heck out of here hour!! The music was good but will never return!!!"}
{"text":"Irish Wolfhound hosts our ADT Divers' Social every 2nd Thursday of the month. Aimee and her staff are top notch handling our large parties. Food is great and service is fast! Can't thank them enough."}
{"text":"Still one of my favorites on the west side.  Steak sandwiches and Reuben's are excellent.   

Prices are right and the service is always great."}
{"text":"Always a cool vibe in here. Love the live music. I've only had a few things on the menu but I really enjoyed their fish and chips."}
{"text":"On a mission to try a new restaurant, I decided to try this place, as it was once featured on \"Check Please Arizona.\" We came on Saturday night around 7 and was sat immediately. Unfortunately, this was the last time we encountered anything resembling quickness. After about 5 minutes of browsing the menu, I looked at my watch and decided to give them another minute for someone to check in on us. Luckily a server finally noticed us, apologized for the wait and took our drink order. 

The service did not redeem itself, however, as our server spent no more than 90 seconds total over 3 visits to the table. This will be the reason why I will not come back here. 

I had the prime rib, which was the Saturday special. They were out of the twice baked potato, but the meat was excellent. 

The bill was just dropped off without a thanks or anything. A drone dropping off a bill would have made more noise and been friendlier."}
{"text":"Waited one hour for food and all we ordered were appetizers. Lovely patio to watch sunset but sadly, did not get to enjoy it with our food. Spoke to manager to inquire after waitress simply said they were really busy and manager less than customer friendly. Said Fridays were always busy. That should be a clue to staff up in the kitchen that day. No excuse for that timeframe. Will not return even if food was tasty. Dont come hungry."}
{"text":"First off, Lisa C. Is complaining about issues while being dishonest about the events. If you read any of the reviews similar to that night, those customers like Lisa were sharing their \"all you can eat fishfry with their friends and family and also didn't want to pay for their meals because the band was playing and they were asked if they could clear the dance floor..... disregard their b.s. review. Irish wolfhound has nothing but super professional servers and extraordinary management! I've been coming here for 4 years now and I have NEVER had a bad experience. I also know exactly what happened that night. If you want a good night with great food and service, you would be missing out if you skipped this place."}
{"text":"The best things are worth coming back to again, and again, and again. I have never had a bad meal here: we get the boiled bacon sandwich-without the bread and mustard, and the fish and chips. It's always good each time. I know we should try something new, but these two things are always too good to pass up.

I love the boiled bacon ......it's just so good."}
{"text":"I was so hopeful of this place when I first learned about it. I've been looking for a good Irish pub and my fiance is a Green bay fan so this bar seemed like a perfect fit. The first visit wasn't bad. The food was a little disappointing but the bar tender was friendly and the live band was awesome! The outdoor patio is pretty cool too. When I learned they had a bloody Mary buffet Sunday mornings I lost it. This place was going to be our new home. But when we tried for the bloody Mary buffet and Green bay game the food had gotten worse, it was a long wait and not very busy for such a wait and the \"buffet\"choices were  lame and looked like they'd been sitting out way too long. But the Mary mix selection was pretty cool. I thought we caught them on a bad day so we tried one more time and it was even worse. We may try again but only for drinks and music. The crowd is super friendly though. Love that!"}
{"text":"Have been there twice with groups and  everyone loved the food. HOWEVER, skip the Dublin Coddle. While this is a real Irish dish it is so bland and uninteresting you will hate yourself. My 97 year old mother couldn't add enough salt, pepper and vinegar to make it taste like anything. My daughter lives in Dublin and it's just as bad there so it's no slam to the restaurant. They should just take it off the menu."}
{"text":"Great local place \"All\" the food is great.my favorite  is the mussels & clams with the spicy  sauce."}
{"text":"We had lunch here last week and it was very yummy. I had the boneless wings appetizer, and it's one of the better ones in the area. My son had shepherd's pie and enjoyed every bite, said it tasted home cooked. My husband had the bangers and mash - he thought it tasted very good. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Fish fry on Friday nights is the best, great food and great drinks. Staff is always friendly, even when it gets crazy busy they are still upbeat. You guys have an awesome place, I'll always come back! Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I went here a week ago and the service was great. Then, I went back Sunday for lunch and I can't say it was the same.It wasn't even crowded and there were tons of servers. Our server took forever to give us our drinks and our food. She came to us twice... to give us our cold food and check. Wait, I take that back, three times, she took our order, brought our food, and gave us our check.

The decor is great and the atmosphere is nice. But, I can't say it was the same for the slow servers on a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Amazing food! My husband and I ordered shepherds pie, and cornbeef and cabbage. Delicious! The waitress was super friendly too. The only complaint is the hostess seemed annoyed by everything. Maybe she was having a bad day."}
{"text":"This place has great prices, great food and great music!  Beer prices are very good for going out and the fish and chips is fabulous!  The Biffo's is the best band they got, never miss a month when they are there.  Tons of tv's and screens and an awesome, comfortable patio."}
{"text":"Good food, but I have to admit I'm not overly adventerous especially with Irish food. I typically get soup and salad or a turkey sandwich.  We used to go for trivia but have stopped since we moved.  They have a good bar selection."}
{"text":"Irish wolfhound is a awesome bar and restaurant the food was awesome the drinks were cold and the service was superb. I am very picky with my bars but i would frequent this again"}
{"text":"Finally, a great bar in the far west valley and to top it all off its an Irish Bar!!!  I've been there 3 times now  and the service and food have always been excellent.  The potato leek soup is as good as my mothers and thats saying alot!  The Declan's Irish Stew was so good it bordered on decadent.  Imagine a rich stew loaded with celery, carrots, leeks, and potatoes surrounding an entire lamb chop that is so tender it falls off the bone as soon as your fork touches it.  My hubby loves the seafood chowder and the corned beef. 
The wait staff is very friendly and amazingly remembered us and our drink order after just one visit.

{"text":"Unfortunately, the folks in Surprise are unaware of what Irish food actually is. While traveling through surprise for work, I dined here after receiving rave reviews from a local. I ordered the \"Irish Nachos\" and Bangers and Mash. The nachos were barely reheated steak fries, drenched in cheese whiz, covered by a handful of bag quality bacon bits. The bangers were actually more like hotdogs, arriving cold with a hotdog spiral like consistency, rather than true sausage. The mash was potato flakes. The \"root vegetable\" side was green beans, brown celery, and a few bits of carrot covered in stale lemon juice. Gordon Ramsey would pop a blood vessel, as all of this Irish food consisted of prepackaged, reheated filler. The only redeeming quality was the friendliness of the wait staff, but that was not enough to compensate for the poor quality of the food. If you are craving Irish food, which traditionally consists of meaty sausages, actual potatoes, and for the love of God - real cheese, then this place with the atmosphere of a mall chain restaurant is best avoided."}
{"text":"I tried to try it, but they had other ideas. 

Needless to say the service was the worst I have experienced in a while. My wife and i decided to try out Irish Wolfhound on a Friday Happy Hour. We sat at a table and waited 10-15 minutes before we were approached, and it was not that busy. I was quite surprised that the happy hour specials consisted only of domestic drafts and well drinks. I had expected some of the Irish fare to be included. We ordered a drink as we read the menu. 

When our drinks showed up we ordered an appetizer as we continued to peruse the menu. The appetizer came back with a fresh drink and we did not/could not make contact with our waitress for another hour after. We tried a few times to flag her down but were unsuccessful. She seems incapable of handling more than one table at a time, and that seemed consistent with the other wait staff from what we observed. When she did finally return to our table we closed out our tab and went across the street to Buffalo Wild Wings to get something to eat. 

I sent an e-mail to the restaurant through their website and never received even a note saying they were sorry for the inconvenience. I guess if you are going to go there only seat yourself at the bar."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with Irish wolfhound Staff and Management , I had heard so much about the Irish Wolfhound, I decided to take  my first trip there.. I was very happy when I looked at the menu and saw that they had Irish cocktail sausage. When our waitress came over we asked her if she knew  what kind where they and she told me Donnelly's. So we ordered 2 orders of them as Donnelly's was a brand I knew.  I was very happy when they came out as they looked and tasted exactly what I was used too.. When our  Waitress came back to see how we were getting on, we asked her if she knew where they got them and she told me that I should contact Irish Wolfhound by email and that the management would get back to me.I got a call back from Amy Monahan..   
 Amy informed me where she got them and told me that they had to be special ordered .. So I asked her if she would mind giving me the details as I would love to order some.  I contacted the vendor where they get them from and explained to them that I had been out at the Irish Wolfhound and they had the Donnelly's Cocktails sausage and I would like to put in a special order for 2 boxes. They asked me if i had the product number it would be easier for them to look it up. So I called the restaurant again and the chef gave me the details. So Finally the Cocktails sausages were special ordered...  I received the sausage this week and was very excited as I had waited for so long.  I had told the rest of my Irish friends that I had gotten them and come on over for some Donnelly's Cocktails Sausages. Well  They were NOT Donnelly's Cocktails sausages, Not the same thing I had eaten  at Irish Wolf hound. They are American smokies.. I can't understand as  we got them from the same vendor with the same product number that the Irish wolf hound gets.  They told me they were Donnelly's cocktails sausages at Irish wolf hound when I asked  but the product that I received had a different name on them.. 
 It makes me think that when someone ask or question a product at the Irish wolf hound they have a box of the real ones and they pull them out ..But if you don't ask, you will get the American Smokies.   As what I ate and what I ordered were too different things.  I am very annoyed with Amy and the chef at Irish wolfhound.. I have 3 bags of American smokies that I would like to trade with Amy at the Irish wolf hound for the Donnelly's cocktails sausage that she was giving me the details for.. 

I JUST WISH PEOPLE WOULD BE HONEST ... 
IT IS ALSO FAULTS ADVERTISING .  PEOPLE DONT BE FOOLED by the Irish Wolfhound Irish Food..  It is NOT...  I also posted on there Facebook page and the message was deleted."}
{"text":"I have only been to the Irish Wolfhound on team trivia nights (about a dozen times over the last few years).  I like the decor and the food is good.  My go-to item here is the Reuben.  I have had the larger corned beef/cabbage platter in the past, as well as a couple of the soups and salads.  Of course, I don't go here starving, but order to have something before/between trivia rounds.  The Reuben with a side cup of barley soup usually fits the bill.

One thing that I could do without is their hidden practice of charging a different (read higher) price for soft drinks ordered once trivia starts.  It is a pretty shady practice, especially since it is not mentioned upfront.  I only noticed because I ordered iced tea before things started, and a relative ordered hers 15 minutes later and two prices were on the bill.  The waitress was confused, and thought that she would be able to fix it.  BTW, our tab was about $65 pre-tip for a 4-person table, so we we were not exactly nursing a tiny order just to play trivia.  Her manager stood his ground over this silly, deceptive practice.  Nice move.  There are two other trivia locations in Surprise and several in nearby areas.  Guess which Irish-themed place has dropped from first to last in the rotation.  Over a matter of a couple bucks they have lost multiple visits.

But we still visit, just less often."}
{"text":"This bar has horrible service. We were happy a couple weeks and didn't mind the lack of service we received. We brought friends to watch the games and are ashamed at our recommendation. We came 3 hours before the games and have constantly asked for one measly television. There have also been a few fellow customers who went to speak with the manager with us, and we were told none of  games would be changed whatsoever. However while we settled with the Cardinals game, that game was switched. Even another television claiming to show the Tampa Bay game has been switched. It has been the worst experience I've ever had, and I'm never one to complain. We will not be tipping our waitress, wherever she went. Not to mention one member in our party had to stand next to the computer to finally be able to order food. What a shameful bar. The only reason this has a star rating is because there has to be. It would otherwise be 0/5 stars."}
{"text":"Want a draft Guinness? How about some bangers and mash? This is the place. Want to watch football on a huge screen? Yep! Great service, oh yeah! 
If you want quiet, well not so much. Music, TV, people laughing. Friendly people. Definitely coming back, next time I'm in the area. Thanks Yelpers, for the recommendation!"}
{"text":"This place has some good food and is a nice place to hang with friends after a good workout. I usually get a burger here and they come out pretty good. They have a bunch of beers on tap and the interior of the place is set up nicely. Live music some nights and a game room with darts and pool tables as well. The patio outside is great if you're a smoker (not me though). Prices are average to higher but at least it's going towards a real restaurant and not a chain."}
{"text":"First - REAL Irish food can be found here. Shepherd's pie, Black pudding, Irish breakfast, great boiled bacon, whiskey, soda bread, whiskey, Irish Stew, whiskey...
Yeah, you get the idea.
The bar is tended by real professionals that can pour you a perfect pint.
You can then head out to the patio for a smoke and drink or shoot some darts in the game room.
A great time at a great place where the service is fast, personable, and just never seems to tire of bringing me food and drink."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times and each time the food has been totally bland. I gave it two stars only for the soft pretzel and for the poor wait staff who look like they are all about to quit or cry. Pro tip: don't leave your ID at home or they will interrogate you and tell you that you must bring a parent with you if you want to eat there (even if you're 30)."}
{"text":"I went on St Patrick's day and had a great time, good music and decently priced drinks. Don't know how it is the rest of the time. Definitely one of the better bars in Surprise."}
{"text":"New to the area and wanted to try it out. I loved it!! Great bar, WAY bigger on the inside then it looked from the outside which was a nice surprise. Great food, Great atmosphere and great people. 

Would give it 5, but the service is a little on the slow side. Im not expecting super fast service and always being check on...... but the couple of times I have gone there It takes a while to get someone to us right away (usually you seat yourself) and the bartenders don't really seem very interested in the new people that walk in..... 

Other then that!! I love this place. Went on a Sunday night by chance and they had a super fun trivia night! It was so cool to see people getting into it they way they do!"}
{"text":"First time there - flyin' solo and immediately felt welcome.  Seating could be more comfortable or I could be younger.  Delicious soup and sandwich with a Harp and loved the ice cream sandwich with Baileys. Server was great.  Will go again-patio looked interesting come cooler weather."}
{"text":"Love this place. Alecia is the best waitress. Great homemade soups, fish & chips, shepards pie. A keeper!"}
{"text":"Wolfhound is my favorite pub in Surprise. The Irish theme is really cool and we always get great service. I'm not really into Irish food so I can only speak for their burgers which are good and their boneless wings which I love! I've also had the fish and chips which are good and their shrimp basket app is awesome. Once went outside the box and tried the potato nachos - very good. Good beer with good ambiance. Nice little pub. It's a go-to when meeting up with friends in town."}
{"text":"My favorite bar! Sam is my favorite bartender. She makes the best drinks and has the best personality! The bands are always awesome and the owners are so nice. Oh, and they have the best tater tots ever"}
{"text":"Super sad. They no longer have the Pub Steak that I love so much. It really was a huge treat for me. So we will likely go to another place from now on. There's no lack of steak places around here. I just liked the Wolfhound's take on it."}
{"text":"Me and my dad have become regulars at this place. The atmosphere is always great and we are never disappointed with the food or service. We go to trivia night on wednesday nights and always have a blast- good food, drinks and people. I'd recommend this place to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"Came here after a 8 month break.  Don't know if they had a change of management or what but I was not impressed.  The black velvet had a strange taste to it (had one at my last visit and it was great).  The soda bread was asbdry as sand and very hard/stale.  My wife's steak sandwich was very bland.  Wait staff preferred to talk to each other rather than wait tables.  I wanted so much to have a local Irish pub that I liked but this is not it.  Bummer."}
{"text":"I held my Mother's memorial luncheon at the Irish Wolfhound and they were just amazing!  We had a pre-planned buffet style luncheon and Chef was even there to carve the turkey and roast beef for the guests - an especially nice touch!  I especially loved the loaded potato salad - it was so delicious.  The room was set up very nicely and Amy and her crew were ready for us when our guests arrived.  Very great service and they definitely aimed to please and get everything right!!  Thank you for making this a wonderful success.  It was one of my mom's favorite restaurants and she would have loved it to see us all celebrating in her honor!!

{"text":"I have been here twice now and both times the food was excellent, and the drinks were good as well.  Some of the wait staff is new, heck the whole restaurant is new, so they are still ironing out the kinks.  The first time we went was right before we left to go to Ireland, and I had the lamb stew while my husband had the bangers and mash.  Both were very tasty.  After returning from Ireland we took some family there to eat and the food was again excellent.  If you don't want a bar atmosphere, don't go here, but if you want good Irish food and drink, go, have fun and try the Jameson's :-)"}
{"text":"I've been here probably 1/2 dozen times in the last 9 months. The corned beef and cabbage + the Fish and Chips are really the only two choices food-wise. The beer is always cold and at good carbonation levels. It's a good representation of what an Irish Pub should be. I disagree with Nicholas. I would much rather go to the wolfhound than padre murphy's or RTO Sullivans. However, there is one catch. The food really is too pricey. $14 for fish and chips is a little much in my opinion. The atmosphere is genuinely Irish. My brother lived in Ireland for 2 years and the first thing he said when he walked in was \"Wow this is the most Irish place I've been since Ireland\" With that said, I've always had good experiences and will go back."}
{"text":"Went to Irish tonight and sad to say we had terrible service by Jennifer. We have gone here for years and it was always the place where we would take friends, coworkers etc. Over the years the service has gotten worse - with the exception of a few good wait staff. Decided to take a client out tonight for business. It was a mistake. She tended to our whole table with an unmistakable annoyance and it was taken very personally. My Client tapped another girl from staff on the shoulder and asked to talk to a manager and for that Jennifer kicked him out after ripping the drink out from his hands. It was embarrassing and shocking to say the least."}
{"text":"I showed up for lunch on Friday and the place was packed with older (ahem) clientele. The waitress took a while to notice us but a very helpful busboy got us drinks. I heard the fish and chips were amazing so I ordered that and really was pretty disappointed. The fish seemed soggy and lacked salt. The \"chips\" were okay. I would go back to try the other fare though. Reasonable prices for lunch."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and trying out different restaurants primarily due to the heat....who wants to cook at home with 110+ degree temperatures:)  My husband had the bangers and mash and loved it.  I had an Irish Salad with salmon which was also excellent.  The service was attentive.  We plan on going back."}
{"text":"this place has the absolute worst customer service i have ever experienced!!! management is totally rude and disrespectful! food was horrible and took forever to be delivered! i'd never recommend this place!"}
{"text":"in surprise not many good bars to go but this one has good drinks and we can watch the football  games"}
{"text":"The best place to eat in Surprise AZ!
Everything I've tried at this restaurant is top notch. My favorites are the bangers and mash , and the fish and chips. Order the Rubin Fritters for an appetizer. They are the best. We love the Trivia game on Sunday nights. A fun, comfortable place to go with friends and family. See you there!"}
{"text":"I am a regular at this restaurant, mostly for the fish fry Friday.  I went there with a bunch of colleagues from work on Wednesday to celebrate the end of school. Our server was great!  She was very attentive, and there were a lot of us, all on separate checks and all coming at different times.  

The drinks were excellent and I ate the slider sampler.  YUM!!!!!  The only complaint I have is that they don't have a happy hour and the drink prices are high."}
{"text":"The food was good. Husband loved his fish and chips. My Shepards Pie was good,  could have had more vegetables.  Would order something else next time. IF there is a next time.  Had a glass of Mascoto wine. (A bottle of the same wine costs $13 retail) they charged $8.50 for my glass of wine. REALLY?? A glass of good red wine usually costs that much. The entertainment,  a guitar/singer, was a little lame but I know that must be a tough job."}
{"text":"I now know how restaurants get a 1 star.very poor service. And management that doesn't know how to manage.flat out rude and disrespectful.and for food quality not to bad maybe 3 stars if the food was served above room temp..having managed A 5 star restaurant Before, take some advice .you work to hard for you money to waste here .treat yourself to something better.were they treat you with respect were service is good and food is properly served.sad to say but service at fast food is better"}
{"text":"Real Irish lunches and dinners. Gourmet level food. Guinness beer and other brands. Try the Irish stews. My favourite is the Fish & Chips."}
{"text":"This is a decent place to get drinks. I've never tried the food so I can't comment on that. The patio is also nice."}
{"text":"So...I'm not a huge fan of traditional Irish food, but stopped in to try something different last week. The place has a nice look to it...it reminds me of Rula Bula in Tempe. I went Friday afternoon and the place was dead. Literally 2 people at the bar and 4 people (other than us) eating. I tried the Guinness beef barley soup...has some nice flavor to it and some spice, too. Also had the Irish Wolfhound burger...while the burger was cooked a little more than I liked (ordered medium), it was juicy and hot, but lacked seasoning. There also wasn't very much aioli, I guess I should have asked for extra. Service was decent, but could have been better considering the place wasn't busy at all. I'm thinking this would be a good place to come after work for a few drinks, or when it's cooler out and you can enjoy a few drinks outside on the patio. I'll have to give the food another chance, too."}
{"text":"OK, this is going to be a narrow review. 
 
Liquor and the \"Reuben\"

Went to the patio with a friend on a Friday night to drink some scotch and smoke cigars.  The outside patio was well laid out and not cramped or confined.  Plenty of TV's around if your interested.  The fire pit is smack dab in the middle of the patio, but this was summer time so nothing to report other than it was nicely sized for a patio that large.

The drinks were ordered and 2 scotch and rocks came out in decent size glasses.  I thought it looked good.  Then the manager approached and told our waitress to take them back and tell the bartender to fill them to the top.  WOAH!  We were pleased to see that our top shelf order was given top shelf treatment.  The Reuben was ordered later that evening and it was delicious.  It was classically prepared and the coleslaw on the side was a bit more crunchy then I prefer it, but it was a generous portion in a cereal bowl sized container. Not like one of those small ramekins that has 4 or 5 bites of food in them.  

Through out the evening service was key, we always had someone checking on us to see if we needed anything.  

Overall it was great, I feel I got my monies worth and I will return and recommend this spot to others."}
{"text":"Traveling for work landed me in Surprise Arizona. On the last night of my travels I discovered The Irish Wolfhound. Starting with a glass of Jameson and a Guinness I still had two more meals to expense for the day and I was starving.

Round one: Fish and Chips, very popular and highly recommended. Nothing special or fancy about them other than just being delicious. Sometimes thats all you need.

Round two: Bangers & Mash this had a new twist on it than I have seen in some other places and like the fish and chips very delicious. 

Very friendly atmosphere and staff. I was dissapointed I did not find this place earlier in my trip."}
{"text":"Just got back from Ireland, the food was as close as you can get in the states service was awesome!! It was a great night"}
{"text":"Went on Friday for the first time for the fish fry. Must say that the service is great! All the staff was quick to pick up plates & refill our all you can eat. The atmosphere is just like I expected a nice Irish pub with all the decor and drinks! The fish fry was very tasty & I was impressed with the quality of the fish. The chips were a great addition as well. However I am a huge coleslaw fan with my fish & this was a disappointment. If they can work on making it more creamier with a little more flavour it would be good. For dessert we had the bread pudding and it was good as well. Sweet but not overpowering just right! Will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Love the Irish Wolfhound!
Haven't ever had a bad meal here.  Never thought I'd love 'corned beef and cabbage', but I do!  
Best part is their beer list.  One of the few places in Surprise where you can get an IPA."}
{"text":"Good food. Good view and good service. Had dinner outside and had a nice view if the white tank mountain.  I had the Guinness meet and mushroom pie and it was well worth the wait for the crust to cook."}
{"text":"So here we are 12 months later coming back through anfd thought wee would give it another go .   My wife and I got there a little after noon , not busy, 15 minutes between ordering our drinks and getting them. One bar staff behind bar just standing around and what looked like a manger staring at us, we went up and asked for our drinks and the manager.  She told us she was the manager....SAY WHAT!!!!!    Finally collected drinks sat down and ordered fish  and chips, and some dip thing....fish was good...no atmosphere in here for an Irish bar and if the manger cared she should have visited our table to see how everything else was going but she did not...she continued to hide behind the bar...bill came, no smile, no thank you...we will not be back"}
{"text":"My family and I try to go to the Irish Wolfhound every other Wednesday.  They have Trivia every Wednesday and (I think) Saturday.  The price is a little high, but for the quality of the food, it's worth it.

The two best things I have had are the chicken strips and the pub burger.

Warning, it gets packed on trivia nights."}
{"text":"Fish fry was good.  Irish stew was ok, it's a big bone in lamb buried in potatoes, carrots, parsnips and onions.  Guinness was fresh and delicious and mixed drink off the tabletop drink menu was good.  All around good place that I may or may not visit again."}
{"text":"Nice Irish pub with your staple Irish and English dishes like fish and chips and shepherds pie. you might have to add some salt and pepper or malt vinegar to you dish but this is how it is done in the old country.  They do have a good selections of some great beers that will take you overseas as if you are actually in a pub.  The portions are very good on the fish and chips and to look at it you will develop a craving for this place.   I will post a picture.  I will go back every time I am in AZ."}
{"text":"We would give the staff five stars, two hostesses, our server and the bus person were friendly, efficient and attentive despite being slammed on Friday night all you can eat fish fry.

They have a nice selection of beer.  Our fish was very good, light batter and mild fish, The French fries were mediocre and the cole slaw rather bland.  We were offered more fish as our server saw that we were nearly finished and it was equally good and nice and hot. 

The place was packed with a long waiting list when we arrived around five o'clock but we were seated within ten minutes.  When we left around six o'clock it appeared that there were far more people waiting.  Most of the customers including us were older.  I thought the all you can eat fish fry was a little high at $14.95 compared with $8.95 at Crooked Putter in SCW."}
{"text":"So I posted a review on their facebook page (which was originally a 2 star review), but the owner's response was less than positive, so I have reduced it to a 1 star review.  I never in my life have seen an owner post something so horrible to someone reviewing their food!

This is what I posted on their facebook page..

Went for the first time today. Expected to have a wonderful shepherds pie..cuz it's Irish. It was 3/4 mashed potato..and 1/3 stew canned soup. The side? Was a soup..my guess is cuz they don't fill the pie enough. My bad..I ordered potato soup!! Worst shepherds pie experience ever. Go to Tim finnegans for a HUGE meat filled real lamb shepherds pie! only savior was the 4 dollar beer..and somewhat on the burger my uncle had. My husband despised the black and white pudding..too much sage. Also..overpriced.

Here is the response from the owner (I'm assuming it's the owner)...

You're either on Finnigans payroll or your palate is tainted by all the processed foods and sugars you eat on a regular basis. You over exagerare in your review for attention and fancy yourself a well versed food critic. Not the case my dear. Everything in our kitchen is cooked from scratch and we never used canned soups. The pudding is authentic and Irish because we have it shipped in from Ireland. If you think we're over priced, perhaps you should continue eating at McDonalds and Burger King. Best of luck in your emdeavors and don't give up your day job.

Nice huh?  Anyway, no I don't give reviews for attention.  I would think the owner's would want to know when something isn't right.  Maybe it was a bad day?  Who knows, but someone who can't take criticism in the restaurant business, maybe shouldn't be in the restaurant business!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Wow it's hard to find authentic yet palatable Irish food in the US but Irish wolfhound does it best. Yummy to the core. Staying in Phoenix just two more days but have to come back each day to try more of menu. Filling and the right drinks to go with the food to spark your mouth for more! Go there. Soon!!!"}
{"text":"I went to the Irish Wolfhound as I had won a gift certificate. I won a tennis tournament so that was terrific and then won a prize also.! I was pretty excited about all of this.
I purposely waited until my sister came to visit so the two of us could have dinner together.
We walked in and ordered margarita's. The waiter came and I showed him my gift card and explained about the tennis tournament. She said she would have to get a manager. The Assistant a Manager came to the table and said that the gift card had not been signed by the general manager so could not honor it.
Wow, were we shocked about this.  At any rate, we got up and left.  Went to the Longhorn told the waiter our story and he bought us a drink.  Had a wonderful dinner.
Will not return to the Irish Wolfhound."}
{"text":"I come here regularly.

Their fish and chips are very good and the seafood chowder is excellent.

The beer is cold and they have a very decent selection on tap.

My only complaint would be that their happy hour includes no decent beer."}
{"text":"One of the best Rueben sandwiches I've ever eaten, I'm in love! The price is right, the food is great and the service was excellent. I'm intrigued and want to head back for their fish night because the beer battered fish in my husbands fish burger was some of the best I've eaten. (In the middle of the desert, what? Some of Vancouver's/ Victoria's  finest battered fish couldn't compare to it!)"}
{"text":"What a great place to have some great food, drinks and atmosphere!  The lamb stew and the Irish sausage was so awesome. The lamb was so tender it just fell off the bone. The happy hour drink prices are not half bad either!"}
{"text":"Being Irish is very much a part of who I am. I take it everywhere with me.  I have a fondness for Guinness and Murphy's. So far this is the only Irish Pub in Surprise. They do a few amusing variations on the classic Black and Tan that are worth a try.  The tried and true fish fry brings in the faithful but the corned beef is my favorite bia. A great mint lamb dish was dropped from the menu. If enough requests come in they may bring it back(thats a hint paddys)  High pub style seats and lack of lower altitude chairs are a complaint that I've heard from my mother In law."}
{"text":"I went here with several couples for the all you can eat fish fry. The fish was nicely prepared, not greasy. The fries were hot, unlike others that sit around until ordered. The libations were tasty, and the selections are well stocked. This place is better than your average Irish Pub."}
{"text":"We've been stopping here ever since they opened. We love this place and since it's a short walk from home, it's a winner to us!

The food is awesome, service is so-so at times, but hey, it's a PUB! 

Stop in on the weekends and listen to some great live music.. a must for St Patty's Day!

Don't forget to try the new $1.00 street tacos.. the steak are my favorite..mmmm yum :)"}
{"text":"There isn't a whole lot going on in Suprise, so when I saw the Irish Wolfhound being built, I was pretty excited to try a new place.

My friends and I started going after work on Mondays and Thursdays for beer, food and to watch football. We sat at the bar, service was always great and the food is excellent. I'm a soup guy and haven't had a bad soup, yet. The Guiness battered fish and chips should also be tried. They have a good beer and whiskey selection.

After football season, we've been back a few times on weekends and for St Pattys day. WOW has this place filled up! It looks like word spread and the Wolfhound is full almost every time we go. I've read some complain about the service time, but I don't mind waiting a bit.

I haven't gone as often, lately, but will definately pick it back up once the World Cup starts. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Woohoo that Karl guy is amazing. I sure wish he worked every night, I understand that he can't but boy it sure would be great if he could! That would be super super awesome, because he is the absolute best. I want to live in a world where all the bartenders are as great as Karl!!!"}
{"text":"We love to go here and enjoy the Packer games. Just bought a bunch of gift certificates through our RE/MAX Rewards program so we can take more friends along! The food is good. The bloody mary bar is a blast. Friendly staff and a pleasant atmosphere top it off."}
{"text":"First time there. Food and service were great!! I ordered the fish and chips and my hubby ordered the meatloaf. The only thing we found lacking was that there was no seasoning on the fries. Other than that, everything was great!!!! We will be back on a Friday so that I can have the all you can eat fish-best I've had in a while!!"}
{"text":"We had a great time when we went here to eat. My wife and I dined with a couple of friends and we ended up playing team trivia. It was a neat thing they had going on in the restaurant.

I found the food to be really good. They know how to make the reuben sandwich, so I would highly recommend that. They have high prices, but if the food is as awesome as it was when we went I would come again."}
{"text":"Great food and service, the Friday fish fry is second to none . Great choice of Irish beer on tap . And occasionally the owner brings in her beautiful Irish wold hound."}
{"text":"Excellent Food and a nice clean atmosphere with very good service. I highly recommend this Pub.  It is a friendly place to go have a nice meal and a drink."}
{"text":"First time here. Glad we tried this place.
Nice atmosphere. Friendly waitstaff.
We tried fish and chips, shepherd pie, and corned beef and cabbage from the lunch menu.  Fish was very good. Corned beef and shepherds pie needed salt and pepper, but very tasty.
We will be back."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. 
First time was back in July. Only stayed for one beer at that time. The atmosphere is your typical dark irish pub type of place where you feel you should be dressed in a turtleneck and drinking a Guiness. Definately not the vibe you want when it is 115 degrees out. So we bailed. 
We went again yesterday for a business lunch. We ate in the game room which had a few more windows so it felt a little brighter. Overall not bad. The service was prompt and friendly. The waitress was quick with suggestions and complimented you on your choice. The food itself, while pricey (seriously, 10.00 for a burger is on the high side) was good. I wanted my burger medium and thats how it came. There was 7 of us and we got our food in a reasonable amount of time. 
I am sort of looking forward to one of the 3 actual cold days we experience here in the valley so we can pop in and have an irish coffee or two."}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere.  Great burgers.  Great selection of Irish whiskeys and beers.

However, the best part of the experience for us was the customer service provided by the bartender Tyler.  He was great.  They need to clone all of their employees to be more like Tyler.

This place is a can't miss when in Surprise!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love going to the Irish Wolfhound!  The food is delicious, they have Magners on tap, the crowd is always fun, and they have a great patio."}
{"text":"Staff here is Amazing and very Friendly. Great place to take the family or hang out with friends and have a few drinks. They have a really nice patio with a bunch of Tvs on it with a fire pit in the middle."}
{"text":"This was a new place for me and I always love an Irsh pub but the ones in AZ are less to be desire.  But this place was fantastic!  the food was great, clean and very friendly. 

Pro- Awesome food and great beer options

Con- they do not show the UFC fights"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today with my wife. Every aspect of our visit was perfect! We walked in and were immediately greeted by a cheerful staff that told us to sit wherever we want. The restaurant was very clean with all tables nicely set, the traditional sounding music was at a decent level (we could talk without shouting yet still understand the lyrics), our drinks and appetizer came out quickly (Reuben Fritters were delicious!), and our order was out in record time. I ordered the Reuben (which was easily one of the best I've ever had) the meat was incredible and there was just the right amount of sauce and kraut. I also had their barley soup which was flavorful with nice chunks of tender beef. My wife ordered the Irish Philly Melt and chicken noodle soup, which she absolutely loved. She said the chicken noodle soup was better than my beef and barley. As friendly as everyone was, and as good as the food is, you can bet we'll be back for dinner very soon! Our server was Alicia (black hair and tattoos). She was amazing!"}
{"text":"Not any healthy choices for food.  Had a bowl of soup and it was way over salted."}
{"text":"They have it down. This place has good food and service. The review that tried it for first time on a Friday night at 7PM needs to try it again. This place gets very busy for their fish fry. And they ask for ID's because they turn in to a 21 and over establishment at 9pm for the live music on Fridays and Saturdays (Posted on their door before you walk in). The two pieces of fish they got on their fist order was probably because the kitchen was slammed with orders at that hour and wanted them to have their meals and not wait for them."}
{"text":"I've been to this Irish pub a couple of times. I like the music & the atmosphere, but as I'm vegetarian, the menu doesn't really have much in the way of a selection for me."}
{"text":"I thought the wait staff was very helpful and on point. However, I ordered a burger medium and wound up with a very rare burger."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday afternoon for a few beers. Service was horrible. Sat at the bar for a full 5 minutes before being acknowledged. Female bartender (Kristy) seemed to have attitude & didn't pay attention to all the customers at the bar that weren't locals. It seemed that she only wanted to hob nob with the locals. Every time she served a beer glass she had her hand right at the rim where a customer would put their mouth to drink from the glass. Talk about disgusting. That's the 1st item they teach in bartender school is how to hold a glass (although it should seem that it would be common sense but apparently not.) Each time we needed a drink it was the other bartender (male) that seemed a bit more on the ball & noticed that our glasses were empty & got us drinks."}
{"text":"Very Good Food and Atmosphere!! Music is Amazing...always upbeat and thriving! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I go for the pub atmosphere.  The food I did try wasn't up my alley.  They have live bands playing often and nice patio area."}
{"text":"I'll keep it simple.  Food is good.  Waiting staff need to realize that they are not in Ireland and being respectful to their customers who aren't Irish and who do not know nor care about Irish traditions is more important for business than pride.  I love the food here, but hate the fact that every time I come in I feel like a foreigner and not a customer.  There's an Irish pub in Ft Walton Beach, FL by the name of McGuires Irish pub and Grill.  Its legendary.  Learn from them.  Their staff doesn't take the fighting irish pride to the table with them.  So message to the owners who may or may not be concerned, keep up the traditional and made from scratch meals, but train your staff to be a little more accommodating to your customer base; 99% of which are not Irish."}
{"text":"This was the worst place ever. We were brought there by a client and treated poorly. Jennifer was our server, she never treated us with respect and courtesy, a horrible place to visit"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate lunch on the patio the food was good the service was not the best. Our server was at the end of her shift so she was in a rush to get us out. The smoking on the patio was not enjoyable either. We are not beer drinkers and I believe they are known for their beer selection."}
{"text":"Well...if you are showing up for the all you can eat fish fry...YOU will need to forget the enticing photo of their cod as seen above.  They use a different model of cod...little tid bites, as it were. And BLAND as HELL. A completely uninteresting cole slaw too!  I called the restaurant...loud bar phone, what fun...how reassuring.   So, I called back again later...to ask why the pic was not what we were served.  And I was told, first, without asking really, that it was \"the same fish\" and that it is \"easier for the kitchen to make second\" rounds that way.. And I said \"but the very first plate was little bites, too\"...blah blah blah...bs bs bs BLAND BLAND BLAND...and I have no taste bud impairment. Dont be fooled by fools that claim this fry is tasty. IT AIN'T!"}
{"text":"We liked it.  Nothing shocking here - what you see is what you get.  Looks like they might have live music later at night..  Definitely something of a 'bar' feel, more than a 'restaurant' fee.  

Decent food and service, fair prices.

covered - semi-enclosed patio looked nice, but unfortunately was a smoking patio.  Doesn't OSHA have rules about employee heath and air quality??"}
{"text":"Some real good food here.  Best Reuben I've ever had from here. I have loved every appetizer I have tried.  Large selection of beer and whiskey.  If they had a better red wine selection i'd go 5 stars.  I love to play trivia here."}
{"text":"Kind of disappointed that the Guinness was not served at the proper temperature. The response? \"We only have one cooler.\" So a properly poured Guinness it was not. Hamburgers were good. There was a sour smell at the bar."}
{"text":"First time here for Wednesday \"date night\" with my mom. We decided to try something we've never had: pickleback (bushmills whiskey with pickle juice chaser) down the hatch! Not something I'd normally go for (and probably wouldn't again) but that's because I'm a huge baby when it comes to shots..I think I liked the pickle juice more than the whiskey.  Check that off my list and we're onto the mini irish sausages appetizer.. I'm not a sausage fan but again, for the sake of stepping out of my routine I gave this a whirl. Paired with the plum dipping sauce, it actually was enjoyable. Reminiscent of breakfast sausage with maple syrup. Mom and I decided to split our meals so we could taste more menu items. She ordered the Atlantic cod and chips with cole slaw and I got the Reuben with a side of Guinnes beef barley soup. Where do I start? How about with my most enjoyable food? The soup, although heavily salted for my taste (and mom's), was hearty and delish. I wouldn't mind eating that as a meal. The Reuben was stacked with flavorful corned beef and the right amount of thousand island and sauerkraut on a nice crunchy rye bread. Yum. Enough said. Mom's favorite: the cod. One good sized piece fried to perfection. With the included sides, this was a big portion size. I really liked how the \"chips\" were more or less potato wedges. I thought the cole slaw was a little dry and I think it needed more vinegar, as it fell a little flat on flavor for me. 

All in all, we liked our food. We actually put our phones down ;) to eat so we didn't get any pictures of the meals like we did for the drinks and appetizer. 

I thought about giving this review 4 stars but bumped it up to 5 because we had fast, friendly, and attentive service from a knowledgeable staff in a relaxed and unique environment. This was also reasonably priced at about $40 for the two of us (before tip).

I'm thinking I'll go back again!"}
{"text":"Love the all you can eat Friday night fish fry.  it has become a friday night tradition"}
{"text":"Cool space, nice bar. Lighting was way to bright when we walked in, which was weird at 8:30 at night. Bar was pretty full, but only a couple of tables were occupied.

Decent service, and the waitress was attentive enough. 

The food, however, lets this place down big time. The dishes we had were a 3/10, and that was being generous. 

I always order fish and chips at an \"Irish\" bar as my litmus test. If they can't do that right, then chances are the rest of menu is going to be equally disappointing. Fish was greasy and flavorless. Fries were limp, soggy and also devoid of any taste. Coleslaw was fresh, but again, flavorless. And for some reason, my fish and chips was served with a ramekin of ranch dressing, not tartar sauce. Talk about attention to detail...

Also ordered a pretzel, which was absolutely wretched. The outer edges were barely passable (dry and very chewy), but towards the center was doughy and under cooked. Came with 3 sauces, none of which were any good, and one of which (sweet honey puke) was absolutely disgusting. 

Prices for these sub-par offerings were way more than they should have been. There's a bunch of Irish pub-type places that get it right, like Rosie McCaffreys', Seamus McCaffrey's, Tim Finnegan's and George & Dragon. Sadly, Irish Wolfhound thinks they can get away serving poorly prepared, under seasoned and over priced dishes because the senior-heavy crowd is less discriminate.

It was karaoke night, and as soon as they started firing up the speakers, every table cleared out (including ours). Definitely not the appropriate venue for drunken singing on a week night, given the place had the energy of a quadriplegic in a deep coma. 

Chalk this up to a disappointing miss. I won't be back..."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm too spoiled from living near Padre Murphey's and RTO Sullivans, but this place just isn't up to par. 

The Beer is actually good, I like their bar and drinks selections. 

But the Food and menu is horrible. Wing are shitty, I'm not a huge fan of Irish food but at least Padres has THE GODFATHER which is probably the best sandwich I've ever had. Plus their wings are awesome. 

Also the customer service here sucks, bartenders hardly notice you when sitting at the bar or act as if its a chore to take your order. 

Irish I know you're one of the only bars in surprise but step your fucking game up. Because once a better bar opens up, your going to be in trouble. 

I much rather make the drive out to 59th ave and bell to go to RTO's or to 43ave and bell to Padre Murphy's. 

In fact today I'm going to meet a friend at Native New Yorker instead of this place because the food sucks so bad, and I know I can count on Natives wings.

*UPDATE*
So apparently Native New Yorker is closed, so I ended up meeting my friend at Irish Wolfhound, figured, geez what other place could we really go too, especially on short notice. 

I had a burger, it was horrible. The fries were actually okay, not the greatest but better then the burger that's for sure. 

We tabbed out after 2 drinks and talked. Well after talking for a while we decided on another beer. Waited and waited for our server to come back around and when she didn't I just went to the bar.
I was STANDING at the bar for a while, even looking at the bartender in the face as she cleaned glasses yet didn't acknowledge me and there was maybe only 3 people total sitting at the bar. FINALLY she comes over and I order 2 IPA's. 

Our server then comes back around and makes a comment like \"oh you're still here?\" 

Uh wow. 

After talking for a while longer with my friend, (we were sitting at a hight top) I put my feet on the open seat next to me to rest them while I chat. 
then another SERVER actually comes up to me and says, \"Excuse me sir, we don't allow feet on our furniture\". 
I had fucking shoes on and it's a fucking bar, i'm actually sitting indian style before and after that on my own seat and on my shoes anyway. 

REALLY RUBBED ME THE WRONG WAY. I'll NEVER be coming back, FUCK this place. 
Downgrading it to ONE star."}
{"text":"Went to Irish Wolfhound tonight with a party of 8 for dinner and to watch a college basketball game. We were told by a very rude waitress they couldn't put on the game we wanted to watch. Saying she was rude is putting it mildly. And with so many tv's, it seems as though they could have put it on one of their tv's. We left and probably won't be going back. Too many other good places to go to in the area."}
{"text":"Generally speaking we go for the live music as the food is mediocre and there service is slow unless you sit at the bar.  The mussels are great and so are the sliders.  Avoid the Shepard's pie as it's greasy and bland. There is prime rib  night but it is always over cooked,  It's always medium to well.  The female owner can be very rude, we've seen this on several occasions . But live music is hard to find in this area so we  keep on coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Service is always top notch!! The food is great and atmosphere is where it should be for an Irish pub. While I was there with my gf,  we met a lot of the regulars at the bar. Had so much fun!! Great people,  great bar,  great restaurant. The owners should be proud of what the have brought to the west valley!!"}
{"text":"I went here with my mother when I first moved to Arizona. The food is spectacular and goes with the pub style of the restaurant. The atmosphere is amazing with live bands and tables that are wooden barrels! I would definitely recommend this place to others for a good time!"}
{"text":"You have to try to shot stick if you are going for a night out, just make sure you bring 6 of your closest friends."}
{"text":"Best Reuben in the Valley!  The meat is super tender and you don't even need to chew it, melts in your mouth.  I was pleasantly surprised when I ordered it.  The outdoor patio is also very nice."}
{"text":"Why is this place so popular ? The food is nasty, the staff is a bunch of jerks. Sorry it's not Irish at all! The CBC is not accurate. Don't know what that is look it up."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group on a Friday for lunch and were totally impressed.

Service was quick to accomodate our group of 20. They moved tables, got drink orders, and then all food orders all quickly!

Food was also quite delicious. Everything from the Irish Nachos, Cobb Salad, Boiled Bacon Sandwich and more.Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  I found good food near my house!  All you can eat fish fry!  Nice quiet place with billboards and darts! (Not the real kind)  Authentic decor. Plus the games on tvs. Outdoor smoking section!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Awesome vibe when patio is open.  If you love the Packers this is place for you on Sunday's. Service can be sketchy during games but that is expected when it's packed."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here a few times, twice for all you can eat fish and chips!  Every time we have been here we have been delighted and the times we have brought friends they have been impressed.  Definitely has a very neighborhood feel with good food and good people.  The owners seem to be Packers fans (which I am not) so if you hail from the green bay state you will definitely feel at home!  Good food, good service, good ambiance."}
{"text":"Came here the other night with the husband and mother-in-law to see The Spirited Lads play.  They have Magner's on tap which turned out to be a lovely memory from my visits to England.  My fish and chips were tasty enough but truthfully, there was nothing terribly remarkable about them.  Service was decent and we very much enjoyed The Spirited Lads."}
{"text":"Love the laid back atmosphere, the servers are always great and the food is amazing. Real, authentic food. Delicious food. One of my favorite places to eat in Surprise. Also the servers are always prompt and courteous. Can't find one negative thing to say about it. And on Tues evenings, they have live music if you like that."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best Corned Beef anywhere! Try the Reuben Sandwich, it will change your life! Reuben Fritters are amazing too! Service if very nice and beers are always cold, cheap and delicious. My favorite kind of beer! The rest of the places around here suck pretty bad so it's nice to have at least one good bar to go to. There may be better Irish bars but not anywhere around this town, I can assure you of that!"}
{"text":"We found our new (replacement) Irish pub after losing the Ol' Dubliner.  We came after a spring training game (saw an ad at the park) and we had the fish and chips, very tasty, not over greasy and good flavor.  The atmosphere seems spot on and we will certainly be back and try something else as well!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and I've never been disappointed. The ambience and atmosphere are great, making you feel like you're in a true Irish pub and the food is top notch. 
The fish and chips is to die for and my friend's wife is from England and she was quite impressed, what better seal of approval is there? 
Never had anything bad here. The portions are big and everything is prepared fresh. The seafood chowder and corned beef are equally scrumptious. 
They also have a military discount, so bonus points for that. Additionally, there's a great outdoor patio with misters in the summer and a fire pit and heaters in the winter, sports on the TVs, a gaming room, live music on the weekend, etc. It doesn't get any better, whether you just want to have a few drinks with friends or have a delicious, lovely meal with someone."}
{"text":"We frequent this establishment a lot because we love live music and we love the menu selections. I typically order the Irish Stew or Shepherds Pie. My husband and best friend order the all you can eat fried fish. The bread pudding is awesome. Most of the bands are good, some better than others. We love the ambiance of the place and the service is always good. We always hit this place on St. Patrick's Day, too. Great place to be!"}
{"text":"I would still give this place 4 stars. The ambiance is chill especially the patio. Service is friendly and fast even when busy. The food is really good from what I've tried, I love coming on Fridays for their all you can eat fish fry. They serve some of the best beer battered cod. A lot of restaurants I have gone to hasn't had much flavor but not here. I would also recommend their trio sliders if you want to get a sample of everything. The Corned beef and cabbage is melt in your mouth good! For an appetizer I would go with the Greenbay packer pretzel, it's huge, hot, and fresh! It comes with three dipping sides ( jalapeño cream cheese, queso, and cinnamon butter). The seafood clam chowder was okay but I probably wouldn't order it again. All in all it's a fun place to chill, watch sports, eat, and share a few laughs. Oh! Sometimes on the weekends they have live bands play which has never been disappointing."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The fish fry is the best fried fish I've had, I didn't even need to use the lemon for flavor, the fish had it all on its own. I love the Irish vibe and drafts, the patio is relaxing. Great staff and security, never drama and drinks are reasonable price. I feel you pay for the scenery and atmosphere, totally worth it."}
{"text":"How laid back and amazing. The atmosphere is wonderful. Our server Michelle was lovely, had great suggestions and was prompt and on it.
We started with a Smithwicks (pronounced smidicks) and a strawberry lemonade. Both were fabulous. Then had the Rueben fritters for an appetizer, let me just say I've never thought about a pickle and onion salad but my god it's good. The fritters were wonderfully rich and hearty and for anyone worried about the sauerkraut like I was it's so mild you hardly taste it. 
My husband did the all you can eat fish ( we were there on a Friday) and I had the Beef and Blue Boxty.  Yum all the way around. Would have both again in a heart beat. 
We had things to do after otherwise would have stayed for the live music. We'll def be back!!!"}
{"text":"As many times as we have driven by or have read something about it.  My wife and I went today.  We had the had the shrimp app it was lightly battered and perfectly cooked......Which we loved. The my wife had the fish and chips and I had the steak sandwich. Lets just say that my wife has had fish and chips throughout the city (this was the best she said). My steak sandwich was tender and suculent and awesome.......In 15 years of going to another sports bar with an Irish name on Bell, this is our new lunch place thats for sure. We hope they stay consistant, yummy, and a fun placs to be....."}

No where will you find the perfect combination of food, drink, people and did I mention drink. And it's the perfect place to eat and drink; tasty food; great selection of drinks and did I mention food and drink. These people are serious about pleasing customers."}
{"text":"Food was good. Customer service was not great. It was overall an okay experience and kind of expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Went there for a group lunch.  Pretty good menu selection (there's a guide on the front to help you \"translate\" some of the meals, very helpful).  

Food was good, prices OK ($10/lunch), but the service could use work.  A bit slow, but not horrible.

Worth a trip if you're in the area."}

I had the Reuben, which was sooo... good. Corn beef was very tender and a plenty. Clam and mussel appetizer was outstanding. Others had shepherds pie and said it was excellent. Will return in a heart beat."}
{"text":"I asked the bartender what was his favorite food to eat from here. He give me his top 3 choices. I went with Carved Turkey Po Boy Sandwich,Carved turkey breast on a toasted bolillo roll. Served with lettuce, tomato, Swiss cheese and a sun dried cherry mayonnaise. Mayonnaise was awesome. Cant wait for next trip to AZ."}
{"text":"Had a nice time. Good food, good service, nice atmosphere... Irish breakfast & barbecue chicken salad were great. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"As Irish Pubs go, Irish Wolfhound can hold its own fairly well.  But lets be clear, this isn't a hole in the wall or a historical pub like a Seamus McCaffrey's.  This is very much a suburban restaurant moreso than a pub.  Basically what you've got here is part pub, part music venue, part sports bar.  A formula that somewhat resembles the Irish pub trend around the valley I suppose.  The other thing that stands out pretty quickly when you're here is the patrons.  Being just a stones throw from Sun City West, you can pretty much surmise that this ain't no 20/30s hangout.  Nevertheless a friend of mine invited me to join her and her crew for dinner so to Wolfhound I went.

The restaurant is embedded within a shopping center complex on the southeast corner of Bell and Litchfield in Surprise.  When you walk inside the spaciousness of the place is immediately perceptible.  You've got a huge main dining area (with both a main bar as well as a second bar on the side), a pool table room to the east and a large outdoor patio to the west.  Between all three spaces I'm guessing they could pack at least 200 people in this place if they wanted to.  We came on a Tuesday so the place was probably three quarters full.  There was a live solo guitarist doing his thing in the main room while patrons interchanged between listening to the music, watching the TVs, and conversing.

I figured I'd skip the bar food and go straight for the Irish dishes.  I started with an app of Irish Sausage Rolls.  Three Irish sausages wrapped in a croissant-like pastry dough served with plum and mustard sauces.  The app portion was a little smaller than I expected given that it was $9, but the sausages and the plum sauce particularly were quite good.  The mustard sauce didn't really do anything for me, but that's just me.

For dinner, I went old school Irish and got a Coddle.  Basically a bunch of comfort food items boiled and dumped into a bowl with its own broth and topped with mashed potatoes and soda bread.  The other players in this dish?  Red potatoes, pork shoulder, Irish sausages and assorted veggies.  I was actually surprised how light the dish was.  Even the mashed potatoes weren't as heavy as I expected.  I loved the soda bread (kinda wish they'd given me more), but the meats lacked much of any flavor beyond the broth.  I'm usually a bangers and mash guy so maybe I'll go that route next time.

Total price for the Irish Sausage Roll app, the Coddle, a pair of Smithwicks beers, tax and tip came to about $40.  The price wasn't too bad, though I can't say with total confidence that I got my money's worth.  That said, the restaurant is well kept and the live music we listened to was cool.  Again, an overwhelmingly senior citizen crowd (at least on this night) so it wasn't too rowdy or energetic in there at all.  It'd probably be fair to say this is the most family friendly Irish pub I've been to in the valley.  Interpret that however you wish."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great.  We sat on the patio, weather was beautiful.  Good selection was very good; we had a hard time deciding what to order!  Food is a little pricey.  We ordered the shrimp appetizer, salad, and a burger.  Everything tastes great, no complaints.  The only reason I am giving them a 4 star is because the service wasn't the best.  We had to wait a long time between visits from the server, a refill at one point took a half an hour, and my cousin never got her salad dressing.... Kind of need salad dressing for a salad.  The server did take the salad off the bill which was cool but the experience would have been 5 stars if we didn't have to wait so long for everything and would have been given salad dressing.  Will definitely give them another shot and update review at that time!"}
{"text":"Love the Friday fish fry and my wife loved the prime rib. Great live music and good atmosphere. My only negative is that it can be a bit expensive especially if you have a couple of cocktails."}
{"text":"Love the food and the amazing entertainment!  Love going here and celebrating my Irish heritage!"}
{"text":"When I lived in the area, I'd come here occasionally for a few drinks. I really liked the patio outside, I could take my drink out there and smoke. I don't remember which night of the week they had a DJ, but I enjoyed it. Can't really say much about the food because the only thing I got there was a salad, and it was pretty decent."}
{"text":"I don't understand all of the excellent reviews this place gets. Either the people who are rating the Irish Wolfhound are there just to drink and don't care about the food to soak up the suds, or are imports from elsewhere in the country and have no taste buds.

Let me just say: Worst. Shepherd's. Pie. Ever.

The menu says \"One of our most popular combinations - shepherd's pie and a cup of your choice of soup.\" Since shepherd's pie is more authentic to Irish traditions than fish n' chips, I decided to go with that. The soup was OK enough, as it at least had some salt. The shepherd's pie? Not even close. A small one-cup ramekin, half full of whipped potato topping, on a base of no-salt/no-flavor ground beef with an occasional knob of carrot or celery? For $10.99? Curry & Chips as an appetizer for $6.99 that has maybe - and I stress, maaaaybe - three small red potatoes sliced into wedges and fried? ARE YOU SERIOUS??

The kitchen got my girlfriend's order wrong even though the waitress wrote down her request to hold the tartar sauce on her fish sliders - we watched her as she put pen to paper. I tried doctoring my shepherd's pie with first salt, then tabasco, then some of the horseradish sauce served with her order of sliders, all to no avail. The total bill came to $58, including 10% tip - $16.50 of which was our bar tab. Our waitress didn't check on our order (which was incorrect) until my meal was mostly consumed and her fish slider was cold.

Shepherd's pie is supposed to be made with lamb, not ground beef. It also has peas - not celery - as part of the base, and should have rosemary and tomato paste for body and complexity. There was NO salt, NO peas, and the thinnest broth imaginable. If this is \"one of your most popular\" and you make one of the most traditional Irish fares this piss poor, then I can't trust other reviewers to know what the hell they're talking about when it comes to reviewing the food at this place.

This was a one-and-done. I cannot justify a second attempt when the cost would have been equivalent to a serious steak dinner for two at Logan's Roadhouse, Longhorn Steakhouse, or Texas Roadhouse and leaving me still hungry."}
{"text":"Based on reviews I was expecting much better. Poor quality food served cold was the reality."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our trip from Tucson to Las Vegas and was very impressed!  Authentic Irish pub and menu, I.e. bangers & mash, corned beef, shepherd's pie, etc. Arrived at 3 pm, server was prompt, friendly, and food was awesome, right down to the fresh bun holding in my crispy, non-greasy fish fillet sandwich.  Several TVs and outdoor seating.  I laugh at the reviews where people are disappointed in their margaritas here! Order a Guinness for Pete's sake ... this is an Irish Pub, NOT Chili's!!!  Definitely recommended for hearty Irish fare!"}
{"text":"Eh. The Saturday night that we showed up, back in March, it was just dead.  I liked the band that was there that night, but the service was ridiculously slow for how few people were there.

I haven't been interested in going back."}
{"text":"Very good. Had the corned beef and mash. Waitress was fast and super friendly. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan.  A couple of friends and I came here for a birthday celebration on a Saturday night.  I thoroughly enjoyed the pub atmosphere and the variety of choices on the menu.  I had the potato leek soup, which was perfectly creamy and...leeky?  LOL.  And I couldn't help myself...I also had Ciaran's Fish Sandwich, which has their Guinness batter fried fish on an egg bun.  It was super tasty and went well with my soup and beer.  

The only thing I didn't especially like was the Irish band that basically prevented us from being able to have conversations with each other.  It was way too loud.  I love it when restaurants bring in local bands (but just like The Yard downtown)...turn the damn volume down!  It's not a concert and people do like to converse over plates of food."}
{"text":"Corn beef and cabbage was the best!! Great indoor and outdoor experience.  Will be going back to try other menu items.  All sounds delicious!"}
{"text":"Found this place on my way back from Wickenburg. Get the lamb shank stew, phenomenal. My husband got the irish breakfast burger which was equally good. Drinks are on point. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place is consistently awesome and they have a great patio, one of the best in surprise. Always have great food and service. They are thin on craft brews but then again it is an Irish place. Give it a try, can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I absolutely will not spend another dime with this establishment. I used to go there on Fridays for fish and chips and spent a lot of money there, especially for St. Pattys day. I had some family was visiting and my uncle liked playing pool so we stopped there for pool before dinner. I put $20.00 in the juke box only to play 2 songs before the owner sent out the waitress to tell me she didn't approve of the music we were playing even though we played it before. It was Nirvana and Pearljam. First off, if don't approve, then why is it on the juke box. Second, the owner couldn't ask me herself. Third, there was maybe 12 people in the establishment and I'm assuming they were snowbirds. The waitress snapped at us an raised her voice. I asked for my money back and left. We walked across the parking lot to State 48. The place was hopping and very friendly. I'm guessing the mannerisms from the owner and help are a big reason for lack of customers. I love to support local businesses, but this one will definitely be scratched off my list. I work in customer service and this place lacks it in every aspect!!!!"}
{"text":"Irish Wolfhound is our new local favorite for great food and a place to socialize or sit and unwind!  We love the atmosphere and the staff.  All are so friendly and make you feel welcome.  

We've been there 3x in 3 weeks now - twice on a Friday night for fish fry and once on a Sunday (before football season started) for late lunch.  

We have tried the fish fry, shrimp basket, Reuben and Sheppard's pie/soup (seafood chowder) for our meals.  Tried the Ice Cream Bash and Bread Pudding for dessert.  All were very tasty and larger portions.  Two people could share the Reuben plate.  

We have been looking for a good all you can eat fish fry since moving here and this is the best so far.  A little more expensive ($15.99) than what we are used to however the atmosphere and service are amazing so we feel it's well worth it."}
{"text":"God love you, you guys just can't fuck up. 

We've had many pints and almost everything on your menu, and even some drinks that weren't. 

And you guys are consistently fucking awesome. 

For that, We are forever in your debt.  

I jusss wanna put you ovar my knee & smack you Rosie."}
{"text":"Good ambience and nice atmosphere.  Their all-you-can-eat fish fry was excellent.  A local band was setting up while we ate, and we stayed for a few of their songs, which they played well.  Id suggest this place if you're into the whole Irish brewpub setting."}
{"text":"Horrible!!! Who takes a beer back with a broken glass and instead of giving us a new beer dumps it into another glass that is also chipped... ( there could of been broken glass in it) also we order an appetizer for four and it comes with one bun and so we order 3 more buns at $2.00 each!!! who does that? I'm mean seriously it's an appetizer for four of us... At the end of the night $130.00!!!! Never again!!!"}
{"text":"I have heard a lot about this place and decided to try. Stopped by around lunch time on a Friday. The wait staff was super. The fish & chips was grease soaked, batter was not crispy, the fish did appear to be of good cut, however the cook ruined it. The fries were limp pieces of grease soaked potato and cold. Wife ordered the ruben sandwich, never again. Rye bread was greasy, not really grilled well, just warm and limp. Very high price for a lot of grease, will never be back, and sorry I even tried it."}
{"text":"This place makes great food and the service is great.  Waitresses are friendly and know many of their customers.  Came here two days in a row.  Loved the corn beef and cabbage."}
{"text":"Updated my previous review from 1 star to 3 stars.  I just have to remind myself that this place is primarily a bar and really not a restaurant - I guess I set my bar a bit to high when it comes to decent food.

The wife was at the hospital with a friend yesterday so I was on my own for something to eat so I decided to give this place a second try after a few years since my first and only trip here.  The place was pretty empty with only about 6 or 7 tables occupied but that didn't stop the waitress from ignoring me for about 10 minutes.  She finally got my drink order and another 10 minutes my drink finally showed up. 

Food was OK but like I said, the Irish Wolfhound is not a real restaurant (hint: medium well means overcooked - burnt really) - more like a sports bar I guess (there are dozens of TV's on the walls).

So....  minus one star for the lack of service and minus one star for over cooked burger.  But they are improving - my previous review was one star."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Staff was very friendly. Our food came out relatively quick. We ordered the bangers and mash and the corned beef and cabbage. Wow! For the price, totally worth every penny spent. Every bite was incredible. We already can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Husband and I came here for lunch. He had the fish and chips and I had the corned beef and cabbage. Everything was delicious. 10 out of 10."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks and atmosphere. We love the Wolfhound for all occasions. The food is excellent,  Whether you are into traditional Irish food or not, you will have a great meal.  

...and of course, the bar is always a good time!"}
{"text":"If you're a localist, then this is your type of bar. Familiar staff, always working so hard, and easy on the eyes. Live music, trivia, great food, friendly regulars... you just can't go wrong."}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here to play darts and listen to the Irish music. The drinks are reasonably priced and they have a great selection of draft beer. The patio is wonderful and roomy with a great fire pit, if only it wern't for all the smokers. The menu is mostly Irish fare (obviously) which involves a lot of meat & fat. However, they have decent wings, good home made soups and the lamb shank dinner is divine.  The service is hit or miss, usually pretty slow to refill our drinks but it's usually pretty busy there. Chrissy (waitress) is super friendly and very accommodating."}
{"text":"Always a good place, could use more bar tenders on the patio!!!! What's up with that?!?"}
{"text":"0 stars. We went in and sat down. My fiancé ordered a beer and waitress asked if we were both over 21. I am not over 21 and she said their liquor license does not allow anyone under 21. So we had to leave. There were no signs at the door or anything. So we called them because we were confused and they said kids are allowed with a parent but since he is not my parent we had to leave. Wouldn't a young kid cause more of an issue than a 20 year old would In an Irish pub? We were really looking forward to eating here and are very disappointed."}
{"text":"An Irish pub in Surprise,  AZ was indeed a surprise.  I saw this place on a former visit to AZ, but I didn't have time to stop in before we left. Glad we stopped in on our most recent Arizona trip.  I liked this place so much on my last visit to Arizona that I came here two days in a row. I love the atmosphere, I love the staff and the food was fantastic.  The restaurant is divided into dining area, bar area and game room area. Just an FYI, nobody under 21 is allowed in without an adult.

On my two visits here, I ate dinner first and then later came back and had lunch. The lunch menu has some cheaper versions of dinner entrees which is nice. The dinner portions are quite large. The Fish and Chips here are fantastic. They are the best fish and chips that I've had outside of UK. Just so, so good!. I really enjoyed the other entrees that we had here to include the Trio of Sliders which had Beef and Brie, Reuben and Fried Cod. This is a nice way to sample some of the sandwiches that they have here. My dinner entree here was the corned beef and cabbage which I enjoy very much, also. I really like the parsley gravy that came with this meal and tasted really good on both the cabbage and the corned beef. The Green Bay Packer Pretzel is also really tasty. The menu is very extensive to include something for everyone.  They have traditional Irish dishes, other options like sandwiches, soup, appetizers, salads, desserts, kids' menu.  They have lunch specials, happy hour specials and daily specials like all you can eat fish and chips Fridays and prime rib dinner special on Saturday.  

Since there is a full bar here, there is, of course, many options for Libations like lots of beer on draft to include, Guinness and many others. They also have wine and a cocktail menu.  We enjoyed beer and a Pineapple Moscow Mule on our visits.  The ambiance here is like a true pub.  We always felt welcome and at home here.  Service was great on both visits with genuinely warm, helpful and fun staff attending to us.  Irish Wolfhound is one of my favorite eating/drinking establishments I have visited in AZ so far.  Just love this place.  Definitely looking forward to being back here on future visits to AZ."}
{"text":"We stored in for some cocktails. There was a band called \"The Real Thing\" they were awesome and Amber our waitress was spot on! Funny, a little politically incorrect (which is absolutely a plus!) Attentive and just cute as hell. My long island iced tea was perfect which is a difficult thing to find.

We didn't eat they but next time we ate in town, rest assured we will be back to see how the food is. Looking forward to the shepherd's pie."}
{"text":"Love love love 2-1 Mondays and Carl! Never eaten there but it looks delicious... Karaoke night is always an experience. Def recommend this bar."}
{"text":"So this is a cool place to hang out in surprise. Has a big patio when it's nice outside with a big fire pit. Very good selections of beers.  I have just went here to have a couple of drinks I have only ordered the Irish nachos. So they are red potatoes cut in half covered in cheese. Really not my cup of coffee but defiantly different. Probably would not order them again."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good.  They do have bands on the weekends as well.  All in all, a great place in the far West Valley."}
{"text":"We had the fish sandwich and I was very disappointed... for one thing the sandwich with some fries was $12 and then when the sandwich came it was a little sliver of fish in the middle of the sandwich didn't even cover the entire bun so very disappointing I do not recommend this place prices are too high and the food is shotty"}
{"text":"After fours years of living here, and kept on talking about eating here. I finally had my chance! 
1st mistake, do not take your wife who hates seafood, and can not stand the smell of fish here on Fridays! It's all you can eat fish fry! After getting over the smell, she was fine.
Now I wasn't sure if this was a restaurant that serves beer? Or a bar that serves food. This place looks a lot larger from the outside, however it can still sit a lot of customers by using their outdoor patio.
Now the food!
I order the bangers and mash, I was very satisfied with this dish. Really enjoyed the sausage. Very good taste, loved the texture and seasoning. 
Our girls both had chick tenders, both liked their dishes very much. I actually tasted the tenders and I also agreed with them. Again, very good seasoning.
Wife had a cheeseburger, and after taking a bite out of it. I knew she liked it, because of the grill taste of it! She loves her charbroiled flavor. I also had to get some hot wings. The girls like to have them every time we go out. They were good, and very tasty.
Service was great, even though they were very busy for the Friday fish fry. They were able to take care of everyone without any problems.
This is definitely a place to come back to, and we will."}
{"text":"Favorite place for an Irish Breakfast! Sliders, Curry Chips, CB and Cabbage, and the soda bread! Also a great selection of beers. Super friendly staff, and great place for good  'ol craic. We always come back for more! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The bartenders (I always sit at the bar) are amazing. Sam, Thomas and Tyler I believe. Always quick with drink orders and the food is always great! Try the sausage wrap things with HP sauce. Trust me. 

If you're looking for a fun Irish pub/restaurant you've found it. They have trivia on Wednesdays at 630 or 7 I forget and live music a lot."}
{"text":"Great food, good selection of beers. Came in on a Friday for the fish fry and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Irish Pub?  Gotta try it!

First time we went just for a drink.  They'd been open a week, so one pint of Harp wiped out their keg.  A pint of Murphy's Amber for me and we were both happy.  Good bartender - gal from Glasgow (that's a suburb of Dublin).  Friendly service, made sure we got to see their menu, told us about their Friday all-you-can-eat fish and chips, their Sunday 2-for-1 on traditional Irish breakfast and their unique sliders - corned beef and cheese on small rolls with dressing.

So today we went back for lunch.  Nice crowd and plenty of Harp (plus about 9 other beers on draft).  I had the fish and chips (not bad, but sorry, lads, I have had better - the fish sandwich is a better buy) and Jo had the sliders (very good). Chips were tasty and potatoey - just like in Ireland.  Slaw was very good.  Bill was $35 for lunch and four pints.  Not bad.  Most of their sandwishes were in the $7-$10 range including sides and their burger is 1/2 ponnd Angus beef.

We'll try the Sunday breakfast next and I'll let you know.  Slainte!"}
{"text":"Love the food, always get good service. We've been here numerous times and it never fails. Went last nite and there was a noisy birthday party in the open side room, complete with kazoos. A rowdy crowd with kazoos I might add.  there was no control over this group and my friends and i couldnt even converse. I wish it wouldve been different."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today - what a great bar! Food was really good - especially the fish and chips and the Reuben. Patrick, our bartender, was fast and efficient - friendly as well. :) Bathrooms and the bar overall were spotless and nicely decorated. Even though we live more than 30 minutes away we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went back for a friend's casual b-day get together, it was happy hour on a Thursday, very busy.  We sat on the patio at a high table.  What was nice about it was that despite the crowd, it was very spacious and spread out, so we had plenty of personal space.  What we didn't love was the service.  Our server seemed as though she would rather be almost anywhere else than working there.  Aloof and disinterested, and in no particular hurry.  One of our friends ordered an appetizer and waited For.Ev.Er for it to be brought out.  She's not the type to complain, so she waited patiently...but one of our other friends finally spoke up on her behalf, and after that a flurry of servers / bussers proceeded to stop by, one by one, to explain that the kitchen was backed up, and this and that, and they're really sorry for the wait.  But one can't help but wonder if she would have ever gotten her order if no one had spoken up.  Atmosphere is good but the service could be better."}
{"text":"We were here for lunch on 1/3/13.  We had checked online to see what was on the menu and to read the reviews. We loved the atmosphere, there was a medium sized lunch crowd with people enjoying their food and lunchtime. Various ages from mid - twenties to probably a few 80 year old gents in for a toddy.

We had such a cheerful waitress who provided timely service.  My husband had the Irish Stew with Lamb Shank and I had the Pub Steak Salad with a great dressing. I had the Pear Cider and my husband a Guinness  draft. Very enjoyable and excellent food and service. We will definitely be back and will bring our Irish sis- in-law here when she is state side.  We both almost had the Irish Breakfast that is served all day.  Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Whenever my friends want to hit a place up that's unpretentious, this pub always comes to mind!

During lunch hour, I love coming here for corned beef sandwiches and relaxing. Saturday nights are pretty popular. There's usually a live band playing on weekends, where some people end up drinking and dancing, but it can get super loud. The outdoor patio has plenty of seating and tables to escape from the music playing inside, when you want to be able to talk without shouting over one another's voices. There are flat screens outside so you can watch football or other sports when chatting it up with friends. There's a big crushed glass circular fire pit with circular seating around it if you want to chill by the fire instead of sittng at the patio tables. 

Seeing as how weekend nights tend to get busy, service is okay. The waitresses will get to you when they can, but sometimes you may have to walk up to the bar yourself to put your order in. Last night I enjoyed a special they were having on Irish Coffee that was served hot with whipped cream on top. Perfect for the holidays! But wait a second, Arizona doesn't get that cold, so of course I had to cool things back down with an Irish Car bomb drink or two."}
{"text":"Notice to the owners. You should show up every so often and straighten your place out. Kitchen and wait staff need a wake up call. I know you can do it. I've been coming here for years and enjoying it very much. The service, portions and food quality has been good for a long time until the last couple of weeks. Last Wednesday, 8/12, I was here for dinner and trivia, with my team of eight, as usual. Aside from Amanda, there isn't a server who could give a damn. We were sitting around for a half hour until we could finally locate the waitress who was supposed to be serving our table. She was busy chatting it up at the bar. She took our orders but never really took an interest in getting the food out. Didn't there used to be a system in place for that? Some dishes came out, after prodding. And of course they were cold and sent back. Some of that never came back out. Period. The salads that made it to the table were brown and limp. Fish and chips orders never made it. My burger, was of course cold and the fries, which seemed to be re fried, were hard as a rock. The accompanying lettuce was brown and soggy and the tiny sliver of red thing on top of it was a tomato slice. I think. Hey guys. Lettuce heads are .75 and tomatoes are .88 at Winco. Throw out the stale crap already. 
Four stars because of years of good food and service, and a bar that knows how to serve Guinness. No stars for the recent downturn. The system that used to be in place has vanished. Don't know if it will be back anytime soon. So we'll take our Team Trivia passion somewhere else for a month or so. When, if, we ever come back, I hope things have returned to normal."}
{"text":"Well. Its Saturday night near a billion 55+ communities. So its busy. But having to go up to order beer because we got forgot sucks. They had a trainee (and she told us she was new) so I ordered another beer and my guest ordered a seltzer water.....well, that didn't come and we told our waitress we ordered it through her so it wasn't doubled. Finally, hubby went to the bar and ordered it. It was mousey service and there was no excuse. We ordered the Sat night prime rib. It was good but lacking seasoning. And I had to give my au ju (spelling) to my other guest because he ordered medium and when he asked for some the waitress said, well when you order medium, we pour it on. I ordered med/rare so I got the dip sauce. Weird."}
{"text":"We had dinner there Dec.29th & I just had to comment. First off the place was mobbed so maybe we're just too particular. My husband ordered the all you can eat fried fish for $15.99. He was served 3 tiny pieces of fish, tiny fries & minimal slaw. He questioned why & was told they always give a small amount & let you order more. When he ordered more, he was told that they were backed up in the kitchen & it would take some time. My husband isn't even heavy so he doesn't really eat much. The fish itself isn't seasoned but placed in a very heavy batter that falls off & you're left with unseasoned fish. I got a very messy fish sandwich. All in all it was a very disgusting experience that we will never repeat."}
{"text":"Not busy on a early sat evening, wish we'd come later to hear the band, had all you can eat fish and chips, it was delicious, our waitress was awesome, very attentive, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We had only been here 1 time before and have not been back for a few years, so we decided to try it again.  We were seated fast for a Saturday night.  Our server Sarah was awesome!  I had the slider variety and it was really good, the fish was my favorite.  The rest of the table had the prime rib special.  Which they both loved.  As we were leaving a a band was coming in.  They have a great patio too. We need to make this a more frequent choice."}
{"text":"It's Sunday afternoon and we are looking for an alternative to the usual. As we drive down Bell Road we spot Irish Wolfhound. I check out the reviews on Yelp and we decide to give it a go. 

I ordered Shepherd's Pie, which came with soup, and hubby had corned beef and cabbage. Both meals were served piping hot  and were good. 

Our waitress was very pleasant and attentive. A guitar playing, song singing duo provided good music and took requests.

All and all it was a good experience and we will be back."}
{"text":"Went on a weekday and sat outside. I had the Red breast chicken and slider sampler. Very good and very reasonably priced. Outdoor area doubles as a smoking area so with a few more people dining outside this wouldn't have been as pleasant. Music was not overly loud and traffic was minimal."}
{"text":"Best Reuben I have had since NYC! Wednesday quiz nights are a bit slow if you are accustomed the sort that usually goes on in pubs, but still fun. The service is terrific."}
{"text":"After years of spending time and money at this establishment,  I was literally banned for being associated with West Valley Activities Group. They have targeted 4 women, so far.   I'm extremely saddened by this."}
{"text":"I've been here about five or six times and I still don't know if I like it. I go here with my boyfriend, who loves Irish food. 

The prices are pretty up there, even for the appetizers, so I always find myself scrounging through their menu, tying to find something small and reasonably priced.

They once let me order of the kids menu, but that was a one time shot. They won't let me do it again. Maybe next time I should \"order a kids meal to go\" and then sneak, sneak eat it.

The only other reasonably priced Item is a small side salad. FYI: My idea of reasonably priced is $6 or less."}
{"text":"I spend every St Patrick's Day here when they host a large event for charity with the Surprise Fire Department. Love the authentic Irish food and entertainment."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great, it was a weekday and it was very relaxed. Alicia was our server and she was super friendly and you could tell she enjoyed her job and the customers. We ordered the Fish and Chips and the Ruben with the Seafood Chowder. All the food was amazing. They also had a really good selection of both draft and bottled beers. I recommend you give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Great just grab a drink and relax. Pretty good food too. My favorite is the Reuben."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was really great! And the man that was singing live music was so good. The only other thing we really liked was the mermaid water drink, we didn't like the food all that much. However the bread pudding was freakin heaven so if you just wants cool atmosphere good music great drinks and an amazing dessert this place is for you."}
{"text":"Gotta be honest, did not expect anything in Surprise to have such a classy ambiance / décor.  My friend and I were here on a Sunday afternoon for a few pints and a quiet place to focus on writing our screenplay together.

The help was quick and courteous, and the Guinness was properly poured and came out at the perfect temperature.  We were here for close to four hours, spent some time out on the porch and ordered some of their fries.

While I cannot comment on their food per se, everything else about this place was better than expected.  If I make it back here and the food matches the rest of the experience I shall bump it to a five.  

It should also be noted, that while the majority of the clientele there is exactly who you would expect to be eating dinner on a Sunday afternoon, the live music was specifically catered to that demographic.  He was quite talented, but there's only so much Eddie Rabbit I can handle before needing to escape on the patio.  My kingdom for some Dropkick Murphys!  And, to be fair, that's probably what they play on a Fri / Sat night... just sayin."}
{"text":"We ate both lunch and dinner here today.  We tried the corn beef and cabbage and bangers and mash at lunch.  Delicious.  The beer selection is excellent and they have a full bar with many interesting specialty drinks.  We went back at dinner to watch MNF.  We tried the happy hour boneless wings(really good) and the potato nachos.  There are many things on the menu that I would like to try.  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"For the past five-ish weeks that I have been a temporary Surprise resident, I have been to the Irish Wolfhound numerous times. It's almost like I am a regular there. I guess I needed a new Irish pub since I am on the other side of the Valley from Rula Bula now.

Everytime I have been to the Wolfhound, it has been busy. Doesn't matter whether it has been a Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, or Monday. It's been busy. It's a sign that a)it has a good atmosphere (love the patio with the firepit); b) the drinks and food are really reasonably priced; and c) the food is way better than you would expect at an Irish pub in Surprise. The cheesecake with Bailey's is so much better than I could have hoped for. Is it NY Cheesecake OMG I want to die good? No, but it is still really tasty while drinking a Harp and playing bar trivia on a Wednesday night. The seafood chowder is a great soup and I don't even like soup!

Service is really speedy and friendly. The Irish Wolfhound hosts Team Trivia on Wednesday evenings which is when you can catch me and some friends defending our nerdiness. If you ever find yourself in Surprise, this is a good spot to check out."}
{"text":"The drinks are good (if u order them correctly.) I recommend the sheppard's pie! Nice atmos, ok service. Has potential to be a very fun evening."}
{"text":"Friends and I attended a painting class at Irish Wolfhound!  We had a blast!  The service was great!  I enjoyed painting with live music in the background   I'm already ready to paint another picture!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here in YEARS! So glad I stopped in. I've gotten the Dublin Coddle (EXCELLENT. MORE THAN EXCELLENT. ORDER THIS.) I've also tried the slider trio - you can skip this for the more traditional fare as the sliders weren't very good. My husband tried the fish and chips and said they were \"ok\". My mom had the Irish Philly Steak Sandwich and seemed to really like it. We also ordered the Irish Cocktail Sausages (skip; overpriced heated up sausages. The dip was wonderful but not worth the cost). Overall, if you're going to eat here, go with traditional Irish food. And order the Dublin Coddle. Thanksbye!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and had a wonderful meal!

I split the pub burger with my mom and it came with soup or fries. We tried both. The seafood chowder was delicious and the fries were fresh cut and really yummy. Our burger was juicy and delicious. I think the burger was around $10 but it was freshly made and really good!

Although the Irish really aren't know for their food, this place hits the mark. I can also see it being a fun place for a late night drink."}
{"text":"Terrible service, this place has a really unprofessional staff. Tried a late night menu and the food was awful. Do yourself a favor and skip this place unless you just want a beer because everything else isn't worth your time."}
{"text":"Great vibe, service & food. Really enjoyed ourselves. We'll definately be back. We had the mussels & clams, the Irish cheesesteak with chips, & cheesecake with Baileys... soooo good!"}
{"text":"First time there but looking forward to returning.  We had giant pretzel for appetizer, loved the jalapeno cream cheese spread. Also enjoyed the Shepherds pie with Beef & Barley soup.  My dish of choice was the Irish stew with a lamb shank.  So good and tasty but really hearty--had to bring more than half home but now I have lunch for tomorrow"}
{"text":"Nice pub atmosphere, great food!  Enjoyed their lunch special of Shepherds Pie and soup for under 9.00 bucks.  Need to check them out in the evening, perhaps a live music experience would determine if they are worthy of 5 stars?"}
{"text":"The food is excellent. Especially the fish and chips and the bangers and mash. So many choices for drinks. This is one of the best Irish pubs I've ever been to. The staff are very friendly. Great place to have food and a few drinks."}
{"text":"Great place to bring the family and enjoy the game, the Dublin Coddle was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great food and peeps. Love the staff and live music on Fridays, Saturdays, Sunday, and Tuesday in Surprise is unheard of!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've visited the Irish Wolfhound. The first, I had a good experience and decided to bring my boyfriend back in to try the all you can eat fish fry. What a mistake! I ordered the Irish salad with steak. Worst $14 I've ever spent, and I've spent money on some pretty bad stuff. Handful of iceberg lettuce, TWO slices of tomato, ONE egg, and one sliced beet. I was excited for the Irish soda bread it boasts on the menu as a side, only to find it was the tiniest slice of dried out toast. The butter package on top was almost the size of the bread. The steak, was a few measly slices that hardly made up for this overpriced, underwhelming salad. I'm actually insulted by this salad. I work hard for my money, and when establishments like this take advantage of that, it drives me crazy. If I could get a refund, I would."}
{"text":"I have been to Irish WolfHound dozens of times.  The food is exceptional.....the staff.... Alicia our waitress  is excellent and Michael they both are the best ever!!!!  Everything I have tried is \"I want to order this next time\" but yet I want to try everything!!"}
{"text":"My daughter lost her baby tooth while we were having lunch.  The waitress was amazing.  Saved her tooth and brought it out in a little baggie for her.  Sounds gross, but the point was that she went the extra mile for her guests."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, once for dinner and once for lunch. Food is amazing! The Slider Sampling is great and the Reuben Sandwich is delicious. Great beer selection and you have to get the bread pudding for dessert!!! Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I went here last Friday. He likes to try fish and chips most places that have it. Well, he had the fish and chips and I had the fried shrimp. We've been trying to lose weight since February 1st, so this was a calorie splurge for us!  I have to say my fried shrimp was incredible. None of the frozen stuff, it was fresh dipped and fried. I don't know how they get it so crispy, but the breading was thin and delicate!  My husbands fish was the same. We decided to share a desert - had to try something since the food was so yummy. We had the apple pie. We added a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. Frankly, the pie was so good, it didn't need the i e cream. It's similar to a dutch apple pie. The topping was perfect, not overly sweet. Their service was excellent. Very positive and cheerful. We got there early, a little before 5 pm, and they were already a little busy. Lots if charm in this place. Uh oh, today's Friday. Hmm. Maybe we should go there for dinner tonight."}
{"text":"Love the food.  Great service.  They sometimes have live music.  We have ordered beer batter fish and chips twice and it was excellent both times."}
{"text":"We stopped in at the Irish Wolfhound last night on a wim for a beer, little did we know that it was their \"official\" grand opening, they've been open for a few months and we've been meaning to try them.  We walked in the door and the man on stage playing irish folksongs on his guitar actually stopped his song pointed at us and said \"DO YOU HAVE A RESERVATION\"  the indoor part of the bar was packed, so we decided to check out the outdoor patio.  the patio was busy but we were able to easily find a table, let me also mention that the chair have this plush padding on them, and also not all of the space heaters were running just a few so there wasn't that weird outdoor sweatbox effect.  A server greated us within a minute or two and took our drink orders, they had my favorite irish beer \"Smithwick's\" a few minutes later we had our beers and they took our food order.  I decided to order the Ciaran's Fish and Chip's Sandwich which included a cup of soup, I chose the Irish Coast Seafood Chowder.  

Now I have this thing about soup with certain restaurants, my theory is that if a restaurant has one good soup, usually all there other soups are just as good.  The soup I had was amazing, creamy chowder with either shrimp/prawns, calamari and I believe scallops, very hearty and we were very excited to find out you can get soup to go for very reasonable prices.  My wife doesn't share the same pension for seafood that I do, so she chose the Potato Leak soup with her meal which I also tried and was just as delicious. 

Our meals came and my sandwich was good size with a piece of fish that took up most of the roll with coleslaw on top of the fish filet.  The sandwich was Delicious, imagine if the Filet of Fish from McDonalds had a cousin that went back to college and finished his degree, that would be this sandwich. I thoroughly enjoyed every bite of it, I'm pretty sure they batter the fish with Guiness.

we stayed a bit longer and had a few beers, our server was on top of things despite the drunken chinese fire drill that was occurring on the patio and inside.

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you live in the Surprise area and want a bar experience that isn't filled with bikers and the blue-haired crowd this is the place to go. With their good selection of beers (including Magners which is very hard to find) and on Fridays all you can eat Fish N Chip, it's a great place to go. On weekend nights I love getting some beers, sitting around the fire pit outside and then maybe playing a couple rounds of pool inside. They also have a great St. Patricks Day celebration around that time of the year."}
{"text":"Great service and really good fish & chips especially Fridays during all you can eat. Get there early usually a waiting line. Nice place to meet with friends."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I love the ambiance with the decor and the live music. The food is amazing. My husband, who is super picky, loved the chicken boxty. And my shepherds pie and beef/barley soup was awesome. The bread pudding was also a wonderful treat (no nuts) to top off my already full belly. The trivia nights are fun for old and young alike."}
{"text":"The irish stew is to die for! Packers bar on sundays. Great service, live entertainment, we love it!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this visit to the Irish wolfhound!! We went once for dinner and another for the St. Patricks festivities!! So much fun!! For dinner I had a chicken caesar salad, and it was really good! One the St. patty's day there was dancing and food booths and of course beverages. For food I tried the Irish nachos, really good, and the brats..YUM!!! Will be back again next year, I'm sure!!"}
{"text":"I love the way it looks inside.  Its the new bar in town so everybody goes, though i will say it is a much older crowd than the other places in town.  I went on a Saturday, they had at least 5 bartenders working.  I found it really hard to get a drink, sure it was busy but I've seen 2 good bartenders handle the same workload without a problem.   I finally got my beer, handed him a $20, got change for a $5 and he was out of sight before I could even say anything.  2nd time I came in I stood there and got bored of doing so before being helped and left.

Maybe they can get the kinks ironed out down the road and it will improve.  They got the patio finished and it is quite nice!  

I recommend it if you're over 50.  Just not the spot for me."}
{"text":"Tried the Pub and oh my it was wonderful.... Very traditional.   The service was good and our waitress was great at being patient with us explaining the menu."}
{"text":"I love this place so much!!! There's live music sometimes, trivia sometimes or sometimes just people chillin. It's got great food, full bar, gorgeous an comfy outdoor sitting area with waitstaff. Love it here!"}
{"text":"Best fish n chips hands down! It was so good the first time we went so that's all I've had. Friday's are all you can eat fish n chips."}
{"text":"Nice Irish atmosphere, decent food,  great service, fun back room with pool & darts, & live music. Enjoyable experience altogether!"}
{"text":"Cute place, I liked the bag pipes in the background and overall Irish theme in the place. They have a large patio for outdoor seating with a beautiful view of a mountain in the distance. The waitress was professional, great personality and checked on our table often. I got the salmon and vegetable dinner, large portions and it was delicious. The veggies looked fresh and not out of can. I would recommend for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for lunch,  and it was exceptional! We were there at night previously and it has music which is very loud. AT 2PM it is quiet, and you can relax and converse.
The service is excellent, and the food is fantastic. We both had the \"boiled bacon and cabbage\" and it was great. Boiled bacon is what we called pork butt as children. This is pork shoulder which is smoked and then boiled. The cooked meat has a reddish color. We have not seen it in the marketplace in years. That's why we both went for it! 
The menu is packed with mostly Irish comfort food, with variations of bar food. Excellent Martinis as well. 
If you like traditional comfort dishes, you've got to go here."}
{"text":"We were here 6 years ago, and when we walked in the patio was filled with smoke. That was back when you can smoke in bars and restaurants. We have been reluctant to come back. Tonight, we gave it another try.

My wife, my oldest son and myself came in and decided to order the pub burger. I noticed our waitress was not writing any of our orders down which threw up a red flag. My wife orders a burger medium well with coleslaw, my son orders a burger medium rare with fries and I ordered a burger medium well with chips. Remember our waitress did not write our order down.

When our meals came, all 3 burgers were well done and I mean...WELL DONE. They were so dry I could not even finish my burger. I also did not get chips like I asked for, my wife did not get coleslaw either. 

The atmosphere was nothing like an Irish pub at all. Where were the snugs? It was an American bar called an Irish Pub because they have a Guiness sign or two but there was nothing about this place that said Irish. 

Our waitress was cold in her approach and I felt as if we were being rushed out but that was fine by me because I had a hot pocket at home in my freezer with my name on it.

The beer was very good, it was cold and crisp and that is where the 1 star came from. So props to the beer. The food and decor was absolutely terrible.

I will not be going back. John Taffer from Bar Rescue would have a field day with the unused space that isn't making them money. They have a bar in the corner that is not being used and has stuff stashed behind it. Total eye sore and if they removed it and put some tables they might be able to make money.

Would love to see the conditions if the cooking area. My guess it is very unsanitary and filthy."}
{"text":"This place kicked our friends out for nothing...the band Tripwire is great but this place is not worth all the trouble"}
{"text":"We started coming here just after it opened. It was a little slow then, but we liked it enough and came back. In fact, each time we popped in for a quick drink, we would leave and say, \" I Like that place\". We go about once a week or so. We typically sit at the bar and always have had great service. The food is great, especially the fish n chips, the burger and the reubens. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Bangers and mash are awesome along with Papago beer, and brazen head live is a bonus, first tine here and will be back"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat! Great food, atmosphere, and service! My favorite thing to order here is the slider samplers! Fish/roast beef/Reuben they are all so delicious!!!!! 
I've had the Friday fish fry but didn't love that. The fish seemed a little soggy and greasy to me but my son and husband love it.
Their Reuben sandwiches are amazing. Loaded with fixings and cooked just right.
PBR an tap; best reason to visit this place right there!"}
{"text":"This is the best neighborhood bar in Surprise.  Very comfortable. Great bands on the weekends and amazing musicians during the week. The servers and bartenders are long term employees making it a regulars haven. I love the wolfhound. I pass many other bars and restaurants on Bell Rd. to come the Hound."}
{"text":"Always good. Service is excellent, food is superior pub food and drinks are generous."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere & service, first time here I tried the Ruben, was the best I've ever had, looking forward to the corn beef & cabbage & the fish & chips, tried my GF shepherd pie, kinda tasteless, not my thing."}
{"text":"Food was really good!  I had the shepherds pie which tasted great but it was a Lil more runny than I prefer.  Service was good.  I wasn't really impressed with the atmosphere.  Johnny Fox's is better for an Irish setting.  We wanted to play pool while we were here but that room was over run with a bunch of meat heads playing darts, maybe they were rugby players I don't know.  It was dinner time and most if the customers were senior citizens.  Doubt I'll come again."}
{"text":"I have gone to the Irish Wolfhound a few times now because the place laid out nice and I was hoping for better. It's just ok but I don't tink I'll be going back."}
{"text":"The food was ok - nothing to write home about.  It is a good place to meet up for drinks.  It has a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food & drink were good (tho our waitress seemed clueless as to the whereabouts of a wine list -- \"We have a lot of other wines, on a big list, somewhere!\" -- fortunately the house wine was fine).  Inside is excruciatingly noisy, which some might find energetic, and outside one dodges wafts of cigarette smoke.  Other than that, a decent meal."}
{"text":"This is Surprise version of Cheers, everyone knows your name. It is a very cozy pub, where you get a little bit of everything you want. Good food, good prices, tv's, live music, the list could go on as on."}
{"text":"It was dark, crowded, but with a muted noise that wasn't offensive -- even for an oldster like me.  I had just had a nice winning poker session in a private game in Surprise, AZ and wanted a late night place to celebrate my win.  This place fit the bill.

I started with some 12 year old Redbreast.  It was a little expensive -- so I thought when the waiter told me the price.  I completely reevaluated when he brought me the glass.  My God, it was at least a triple.  And what a delicious malt.  I ordered some \"hot\" wings to go with it -- hoping to absorb some of the alcohol so I wouldn't fall off my stool (I drink very little when I drink and have a low threshold for inebriation).  

The wings were good -- flavorful, hot to the touch but relatively mild for their hottest of four options. The Redbreast was terrific, but way too much for me to finish -- since I was driving back to my motel  -- and AZ has very strict DUI laws.  I wish it was a motel lounge and I could have finished it and staggered back to my room -- or stayed another couple of hours for the effects to wear off.

No matter, a pleasant environment for what I was looking for with good food and a generous pour.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"What can you say about a spectacular Irish pub and restaurant?  Well, i would begin by saying \"Irish Wolfhound\" from now on.  I had a Reuben sandwich for lunch and it was wonderful, we also had some of their Gunless beer battered shrimp and they were light and delicious.  Great food, great service and great place, I only wish i could go back and use their beautiful looking patio.  Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"I love this place - great food and friendly staff.  The fish and chips are  my favorite!
Marci T."}
{"text":"They called  My mentally challenged brother-in-law retarded and wouldn't serve us and when I tried to Explain that my brother-in-law was a little slow that's when the bartender said he was too retarded for them to serve him , those were his  exact words retarded"}
{"text":"I liked everyone but tom the bar tender he was such an asshole. I liked Sam,Tyler, and Cody. But tom was so mean and rude and because of him I will never come here again which is a shame considering i only live  right down the street from this bar.So sad because I wanted to show my friend from California what a good time Arizona was and it was a disappointment because on Tom!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the fish batter with guiness, the Reuben sandwich is also excellent. The bar and wait staff are friendly, we love Sam and Tyler at the bar."}
{"text":"Great place! We had my husbands birthday here for the second year in a row and it was a great experience. The staff is vey nice, the live band was really good and the food is awesome! The beef & Brie sliders are delicious!"}
{"text":"This has become our go-to spot. With team trivia every Wednesday we are here at least once a week. The servers recognize us and are always friendly. The corn beef/Rubens are delish and I love the laid back environment. They always have full tables which must be a sign that they are doing something right! I encourage anyone in the area to stop in and give them a try!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to hang out on a Friday. The all you can eat fish is pretty good, although I prefer the sandwich. It's a good deal for drinks until 7 and they usually have a band worth listening to after 8. We started going there because it was so close to the house, but I keep going for the food and service. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Ok, I've been there 3 times now. Twice on Saturday, one on Friday. 

First 2 times we were there, service was horrible. The servers were rude, very slow, and didn't really care. 

First time we went there, it was Saturday. We got there 10 til 10. I tried to flag someone so we could get food order in before the late-night menu started. First girl I talked to said they were not serving food. I asked if they were serving late night menu then, she said \"Ya, but I don't know where the menu is\" and walked away. 
We waited for few minutes but nobody came to our table, so we gave up and couple of us got drinks from bar (after 10 minutes of waiting at the bar too) Few minutes after, our server came to us and said \"Where have you been? I was waiting for you all to sit down\" Well, One of my friend was sitting at the table for the whole time and the server didn't go over for like 15 minutes, it just sounds like an excuse. We finally got late night menu, which was a one page print out of like 5 things... We got wings, Reuben sliders, and fish and chips. Wing and Reuben came out first. Wings were alright. It was too crispy for my taste and flavor was so-so. Reuben slider wasn't so tasty. Meat was dried out and bun was too hard. Fish and chip came out about 10 minutes later. It was 1 fish. One chunk of fish that was very over done (dark dark brown). Did kitchen guy forgot to take it out of the fryer? Or did server forgot to bring it out and it got cold so they had to fry it again? Either way, it wasn't so good. Chips were very greasy too. And speaking of server... she didn't know what half and half was, or black and tan... she kept asking which beer we wanted. Overall, we weren't happy. 

Second night was 2 weeks later, on a Friday night. 
Walked in, got ourselves a table, different server. Let's see if this night is any better than last time. Nahhh, it was still the same. 
We ordered drinks, asked for a menu (unfortunately late-night menu again) and waited... She came back with drinks, no menu. So we asked again. Her response was, \"Oh, you want menu? I'll be right back\" She said that first time we asked for a menu! Anyways, she got menu... and disappeared for 20 minutes. You know... if somebody asks for a menu, doesn't it mean that somebody is hungry and wants to order a food? Maybe? Anyways, she wasn't paying attention, so my buddy got up, grabbed a random server that's standing by POS, and asked to put an order of wings in since our server is MIA. As he was sitting down, I see our server getting up from another table across from ours, walked towards us, and said 
\"Oh, did you want to order food?\" so we replied with 
\"Yes, we asked for menu because we wanted to order food. But you were gone for 20 minutes, so we decided to find somebody else\" 
So then she responded with 
\"Oh, I'm sorry we are slammed. I just got like 10 tables.\" 
Hmmmm, I just saw her get up from other table which I could see and she was there for good 5 minutes. What a way to give us an excuse! And we are not stupid, people were leaving, not coming in. The place had half the people compare to when we came in.  And also she was blaming other server for doing her job. Oh, and my buddy asked her what the writing on the wall meant. It was in Celtic. She was running around all over to find what it meant. She failed though... My comment on that was 
\"If only she tried that hard to get our order and drinks right...\" 
So... the second visit was a bad one too... 

The next day! 3rd time is a charm. We'll give it a one final chance before we give up on this place. 
Walked in, got a table right in front of the stage. (We also went 2 nights in a row to see The Biffos play) This time, a server came right away to take our order! So the night started good. She took rally good care of us, got our food, and checked on us more than other 2 servers combined. Later of the visit though, she was getting slower, but I could also see she had other tables she was tending. That's fine. She wasn't making up story about how it got mysteriously busy with no people.

After 3 visits, I give 2 star. The food wasn't something to rave about and service was way below average. I would rather go to other bars with cheaper Guinness and better service."}
{"text":"The Dubliner is gone :( but dang I found a better joint in the process!

First off I am not a fan of fish from the good old days in the navy where I ate some of the worst fish ever on the planet! But you need to order the fish and chips here if you like fried treats and maybe can stand a slight fish taste as long as its golden brown. BOOM this was the best fish and chips meal I have ever had, I even heard the waitress boasting to the Sun City folk that they are the number 2 seller in the US of friken A of fish and chips plates and I defiantly know why in this case. They say this is Guinness brazed fried fish, but I have a feeling it's way more top secret than that. Try this place on the non all you can eat days because you will be waiting an hour to get in (friday / saturday) just to scarf some good eats down. This is due to only one fryer in the kitchen (another note I overheard). The only flaw I tasted was the coleslaw which could have had a bit more mayo or taste, was a bit dry. The chips were perfect, and the fish was downright awesome. Once you have tried this place then you can venture there when it's packed and enjoy a cold one with me ! I will update soon when I can go there and not order the fish and chips (maybe in 2012) Check it, wreck it..."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch with my family in the middle of the week. We were a little concerned by the sign stating bikers could not wear club colors, must be a later night problem. Lately the family has been trying fish and chips everywhere so thought what better place than here. They did not disappoint. The fish was light and flaky, the coating was not heavy but light and crispy. No burned oil taste from an old or unchanged fryer. The tarter sauce had good flavor but seemed a little thin, but maybe it is just a style we have never tried before. The fries were thick cut as you expect with fish and chips and they were also served with the burger. I was surprised by the number of people in here gathered in the booths, seemed like the local Irish were hanging out here day drinking. Not a bad thing, was not made to feel unwelcome as sometimes locals do. The girls serving us were friendly, where do they keep finding these cute red heads? The were attentive and made sure our drinks were always full and checked periodically if we needed anything else, while also tending to the other customers. I think the place had 7 or 8 full tables of 4 or more people and the 2 girls working didn't miss a beat."}
{"text":"I love Irish Pubs and this one is great!  Friday's all you can eat Fish and Chips is well worth it. The Fish is prepared just right and their tarter sauce is really good.  The staff is friendly and fast. The Cole slaw was a little bland - I prefer more celery salt in mine. Definitely go there!!!"}
{"text":"WATERED DOWN DRINKS AND HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT! I recently visited Irish Wolfhound with two lady friends. We ordered 3 SILVER PATRON shots. Immediately after taking the shots I requested a manager because we were confused as to why the shots were watered down. I nor did my two friends have any drinks prior as our night was just getting started. I told the manager the shots were watered and if u are familiar with Patron you already know it burns like hell going down. I even offered to pay for the next shot and have him taste it so that I may get a refund for ordering water. He refused to accept my offer and then he then immediately told me \"don't order PATRON\" walked off. I will not return to a place like that where respect for the customer and their hard earned money is taken lightly!"}
{"text":"Very relaxing with an array of beverage and beer choices. Pretty much the only place worth drinking in Surprise :)"}
{"text":"Best Rueben in town!!! I LOVE their bangers and mash too! Good atmosphere with a big patio to enjoy the outdoors when it's not 100 degrees out."}
{"text":"Used to love this place and I spent thousands here until my wife and I came here one night and the security guard was so rude to us that we vowed to forget about this place. We were having a great night and wolfhound was our last stop of 4 restaurants that night. This Sgt. Slaughter mixed with the 40 yr old virgin was so rude to us. My wife and I dont even drink but I had to defend that fact to this guy because apparently we were laughing and having too good of a time as we walked up to the restaurant. The security guard let us walk in, order some apps, and then 5 mins after came to our table and told us we needed to leave because he thought we were intoxicated. I was stunned as this has never happened to me...ever! I explained calmly that neither my wife nor I drink alcohol and we were just restaurant hopping. The security guard who seemed to have a 4th grade education didnt like that answer and just proceeded to stare and blink at us. I just looked at my wife, shook my head, and we both left, never to return again. Just 1 bad experience can destroy what used to be a lovely place. I dont know when they decided to hire this guy but he is definitely hurting the business. Oh well..."}
{"text":"The bar it self amazing! 
The corn beef is amazing! 
The outside  fire pit is amazing! 
The bar tender (young kid) very friendly 
The waitresses are somewhat friendly 
BUT if you happen to run across the blonde lady with eye glasses mid 50's maybe the manager or owner. stay clear of her wrath
Probably going through extreme menopause
Very rude and very unprofessional absolutely ruined our evening was asked to leave and not to return 
Fine by me! do the the fact that State 48 Brewery is in the same parking lot and they made us feel more welcomed than the Irish Wolfhound wench!"}
{"text":"Chips and fish are delicious! Décor in here is unique and interesting. Staff is friendly from what I have expierenced. Been here only twice but I plan a going back many times!"}
{"text":"My family and I love it here. We used to go once every week to two weeks but it's a little expensive and we're trying to cut back.  The food is always amazing. The seafood chowder, fish and chips, and bangers and mash are to die for! The wait staff is always super nice, they recognize us when we walk in.  I can't drink yet but my mom will occasionally get a beer and there's a wide variety to chose from."}
{"text":"This is a great place. We went on a Saturday night they had a great band and the beer and cocktail prices are good. Will definitely go back again. Food looks good but we didn't order on this particular visit. A nice outdoor patio for those that smoke"}
{"text":"I want to give this place four or five stars. Food was excellent. We went after ten so only there late night menu was available. curry gravy is spot on. No cover to see great live band. Looked at regular Menu, and we will go back, for sure. There were people of all ages hanging out, but it wasn't over crowded like another local Irish place that charges a cover. There were senior citizens  dancing and having fun on the dance floor. BUT THE STAFF, a blonde girl took our order, never smiled, told us her name, checked back on us. We had to ask for condiments when we got our food, we had to ask for a menu... We told her we had never been there before...still zero personality, aloof, bored, and SLOW to get a drink in a not that busy of a place. We had to wave our arms and push our drinks to end of bar to wait for them to notice. I was a bartender for years. This is not a way to establish regulars in a half empty bar. 
Then there was the bizarre amount of security. Two guys with guns, in security uniforms, at this seeming very safe remote suburban location. Sort of intimidating Gandolf character at the door checking ID's. But then there was a another little guy, same get up, patrolling around the half empty bar?' It was just odd to me, that seemed unnecessary."}
{"text":"I love the Wolfhound! It is a great bar.  I think the service we got tonight was the best we have ever had... It was amazing.  Our server finally told us she has a degree in culinary arts and that she tries to provide the service she herself would want... Girl, you brought it and we appreciated it!

We all shared a plate of mussels; I still think these are the very best thing on the menu and they are, hands down, the best I have had anywhere.  The white wine sauce with leeks is divine and the meat just slides right out of the shells, I could eat them weekly!  We also had a plate of fish and chips; the fish was very good and the batter tasty but wow, the grease that soaked into the bed of fries... It made the fries inedible.  We also had a selection of the street tacos, fish and carne asada, they were fine but bland.  I realize they were only a dollar each, but for a small amount of meat, some cabbage, and pico on a tiny corn tortilla, the dollar was about .40 too much.  Cheese, cheese is a common taco topping and these needed it.  Sour cream and avocado or guacamole should have been somewhere... And let your customers decide what and how much veggie topping to put on the taco!  We were informed that there was some sort of sour cream based topping on the tacos but really couldn't taste it and I definitely couldn't see it!  If I can't see it or taste it, it wasn't there... Sorry.  These were great ladies lunch tacos... Ladies that aren't hungry.

But the Wolfhound gets the four stars because of the icy cold Stella on tap, the phenomenal mussels, and the impeccable service on this visit.  Pay this young lady more and put her in the kitchen... Her talents, while appreciated in the dining room, are wasted as I am positive she can cook based on our conversation..."}
{"text":"I was in town for some training and ended up here a couple nights, because after the first night, I found I was on my way back the next night.
Great layout with seating areas for families and a great wrap around bar.  They had a fantastic tap selection and a great food as well (including some traditional Irish selections).  Whenever I'm out I'm the far west valley, I will make it here for sure!
Wolfhound burger and $2 PBR draft, pretty good bargain btw."}
{"text":"Not my favorite fish fry!
Where is the fillet slices of fish I asked. Found out you don't get fillet fish on the fish fry all you can eat. So what I got was three chunks of cod, like large scallops. Not the way I like my battered fish. I llike to taste some batter and know the fish is cooked all the way thru.
And the plate was not generous. They could have served more cole slaw and fries to fill up the plate. This was 14.99, not worth it as I only eat one plate anyway. 
Hubbys irish stew for 15.99 was a generous plate, delicious veggies and meat falling off the lamb shank. He was all happy! 
Will not try the fish fry here again.  Dont bother with bread pudding, it was tasteless. Had to ask for more whip just to add flavor."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I have only been for night festivities  but it has always been awesome.  There are normally live bands and no cover charge, for those that want something quieter they have another room that is farther away.  The outside fire pit is the coolest one you will ever see.  The service is for the most part good.  The Reuben sliders  are amazing and the fish with the fish and chips is good.  the fish just has a little too much batter for me."}
{"text":"I had a meeting in Peoria and needed to stay in Sun City. Dinner came by and I wanted to find a pub... for some reason Wolfhound didn't show up on my search results and happen to find this place by accident. Boy was I in for a treat.

Love the Wolfhound. The bartender was attentive and catering. Cheap cheap cheap Jamison drinks.... Lots of TVs and a lot of space! Ate the fish and chips and it was delicious! Don't remember the type of fish it was, but it was 1 huge piece of fish with Guiness beer batter... YUM"}
{"text":"How have we not tried this place after all these years of living so close? Walking up it looked pretty dead which was surprising to me since it was a Friday night and every other restaurant we passed was packed. Once we walked In though it was packed with people. We were greeted right away by a wonderful girl smiling. We were sat instantly and another smiling waitress took our drink orders. Already I was impressed. After looking over the menu i knew it was going to be a tough choice because everything sounded amazing. After talking with the waitress she told us the fish fry was great and that they had the best corned beef and cabbage anywhere around. I took her advice and ordered that and she must of swayed my husband as well because he ordered the same. My youngest came with us who is notorious for ordering chicken fingers everywhere we go so of course that's what he picked. We also ordered an appetizer of fritters which we'd never tried before. Everything came out so quick. Let me tell you...I had never been a fan of corned beef and cabbage when I was younger. In all honesty I thought it looked so gross and was so bland, but when my plate was handed to me tonight it was like the gates of heaven opened. The presentation looked amazing and it smelled AMAZING! It came with the most amazing gravy on the cabbage and mashed potatoes. My husband and I both looked at each other and knew it was the best corned beef and cabbage we'd ever had. The other times I've had it it was over salted. It was perfect. We asked our son how his chicken fingers were and he said they were bomb.com lol He informed us we were staying until he ate everything on his plate and said it was now his new favorite place that we have been to. I was so impressed from the time we walked in to the time we left. Great service and amazing food. Keep it up guys! Thank you for a wonderful night."}
{"text":"Came here after visiting another bar down the street. I've heard a lot of good things about Irish Wolfhound. On Saturday they had a live band which was very good and the place was packed, but not overly packed. I came here with high expectations but thought it was good, but not great. The rooms and decor looked a little generic. Guess I'm getting tired of bars that call themselves Irish bars by just look Irish by putting Guinness posters and a harp on the wall. But what can I expect from an Irish Bar in Surprise??

Not saying I wouldn't come back here.  Beer selection was good, Guinness was poured right, and good music, so I would come back. I didn't try any of the food so ill update my rating when I try the food."}
{"text":"I would really like to \"love\" this place. But the truth is, I really am not that impressed. I'll give you the good, the bad and the ugly....

The Good:
-awesome patio with fireplace, great for winter nights
-nice decor, a little dark but very Irish
-good beer and liquor selection, most bartenders are very knowledgeable
-frequently fun activities: game/trivia nights, St. Patricks Day, etc.

The Bad:
-mediocre service, servers with poor attitudes
-food quality is not outstanding--- a few \"good\" dishes scattered in a menu of deep fried potatoes, fried meats, and fried fish. All of which taste of oil.

The Ugly:
The last time I went to Irish Wolfhound, my friend and I were seated in the game room for an early dinner. This is was fine by us, as the dining room was crowded and pretty noisy. Our waitress came by and took our orders, took 10+ minutes to get drinks (an iced tea and a beer). I asked about the shepherd's pie and was told by the server it was disgusting. We had already decided what we wanted to order, but it took another 15 minutes to have her return. The food came out, almost half an hour later (we'd been at the restaurant almost an hour now). I had ordered fish and chips, which was fine, but my friend ordered chicken wings

They were burned beyond recognition. Why the server decided to take these to the table are beyond me. Surely the cook realized they were burned as well. When she checked back 10 minutes later, we pointed out to her that the wings were BLACK and inedible. She stated, \"well, did you try them?\" 

No, we did not try them. Because it would be like licking the inside of a Weber grill. She disgruntedly took them back to the kitchen and returned (with a cook) to our table. Again, she asked what was wrong with the wings... we shouldn't have to explain not wanting to chow down carcinogens! Needless to say she didn't receive a very nice tip.

To sum--- get some drinks here, hell, even plan on attending one of the fun events they have planned throughout the year. Just skip dinner service. It's not worth the price nor the haggling with the waitress."}
{"text":"Again, Tried the fish fry expecting not to be as good as the last visit, but guess what ? It was as good. So maybe some of you with the poor reviews may need to look in the mirror. Be friendly yourselves as you walk through the door and treat your server with respect and you will have a wonderful experience here (and anywhere). I will keep coming back. Good Job!"}
{"text":"Like this place. Food is PRETTY good which is why 4 stars, drinks and service is 5 stars for sure, not too pricey by any means. The patio is great! The firepit is lavarock  or something similar and really nice."}
{"text":"What a delightful evening. We enjoyed the live music of Faded Jeans. Current and old hits from rock, country and country rock genres.  Very danceable music. We also enjoyed a delicious Irish dinner. I loved the chicken boxy, my dining companions enjoyed Beef in Puff Pastry and Mussels, Clams and Chicken Wings. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"My wife and I were out shopping yesterday afternoon, and were ready for an early dinner.  Remembered this place from prior research for a good place to get fish and chips.  No disappointment.  Best fish and chips we have had in AZ since moving here last November.  Matched with Harps draft, and life is good!  A very pleasant and informative server.  Great place and we look forward to returning."}
{"text":"No complaints about Friday Fish Fry. This is as good as it gets in nw Phoenix area. Fresh beer batter dipped and deep fried to perfection. Crispy, moist, tender and so delicious. Served with endless slaw that was light and fresh. Chips were hot and authentic. Service was amazing also. Tracy was totally on task, helpful, friendly and efficient. Arrived early (4:30) and had no problem getting a high top with my beauty queen. Fish and extras showed up within mere seconds of ordering. Amazing! At $15.99, I have to call it one of the best values in Surprise. Go get some."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the entertainment. Noise level not for everyone. Food, okay. Had the Rubin and fries. A couple of us felt the sandwich was a little greasy and over cooked. The fries sort of soft. Maybe they are suppose to be, but not what we expected. Also, drinks and food are on the high side compared to like restaurants ."}
{"text":"I've only ever been here to drink but, I absolutely love this place. Bartenders are awesome and easy to talk to. They don't have the phony \"Dutch Brothers\" overzealous approach, which I love. Prices are fair and they obviously have a large selection of Irish beers on tap. I love their patio during the winter, they have fire pits to keep warm and their patio furniture is quite comfy! I need to start coming here and trying some of their food. I heard they have an awesome Reuben sandwich."}
{"text":"OMG, clearly the best Corned Beef & Cabbage EVER!! And they had Carlsberg beer on tap to go with it. Heaven."}
{"text":"Went for Irish food and got the fish and chips. They were on the bland side. The batter or the fish needed salt and pepper badly. The tarter sauce and malt vinegar was good. The cole slaw again was also bland and the chips were good. Should have order bangers and mash or shepards pie. The service and decor were good.Will try it again."}
{"text":"We had lunch here and the food was wonderful.  I had the Reuben Sandwich, it was hands down the best corned beef I have ever had.
The food service was very good also.  This was about 3 mo. Ago. 
Today  we went there for lunch, 11:20am.  about 23 people,there, I ordered iced tea and hubby had a Bud light,  we both ordered the Rueben Sandwich, he had the soup, I had cold slaw and the chips.  Reuben's corned beef was probably leftover, some pieces were very dry and had to chew, and very very salty.  The chips were not crisp, they were soggy, like old from yesterday, cold slaw was the best part of the meal.  For  the total at $ 34 format lunch, nothing to brag about.  Finished my ice tea no refill. Could of used something to wash the salt down."}
{"text":"Music was great.  However, every time I got up, someone would take my seat and the table would be cleared...!!!"}
{"text":"I visited this place on a whim. Two friends and I were meeting for a late lunch and this is near our jobs. It is a pub and definitely has the dark wood, beer drinking, rugby fans vibe, but the tables are large, waitstaff friendly, and food was delicious!

We passed on the fish fry (there were a ton of people who came in strictly for that) and shared appetizers and desserts. We shared the potato nachos, fried shrimp, and curry fries for our meal. The curry dipping sauce was tangy and perfect if you like curries....not burning hot, but obviously spiced. The shrimp were huge and piled high on their little plate. The potato nachos were the dinner hit, though. Wedges of red potatoes are smothered with a cream sauce, cheese, herbs, and mixed with slices of sausage. Yummy!

Being stuffed didn't stop us from sampling the dessert menu, either. Our order was for the ice cream sandwich drizzled with Baileys, cinnamon topped apple pie, and bailey's cheescake (which had a fun name that I can't remember currently.). Even with two chocolate-icecream-bailey's concoctions the mix dessert flavors was varied and hit the sweet tooth spot. 

If you are ever on that side of town, it is well worth the stop."}
{"text":"Food here is okay. I got the meat pie, which I liked at first few bites, but its gets sort of boring... it doesn't have a lot of different flavors in it. Its pretty much a one-noted dish. I took my husband here after because I was craving the pie crust off the meat pie... but my husband really didn't like the food here either."}
{"text":"Food had no flavor. Shepard's pie was watery and flavorless. Fish and chips also flavorless. The owner obviously doesn't care. Vending machine food would be better."}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite place for chicken & curry until I came in for my to-go order & saw the chef through the order window boxing my food with his bare hands. I'm sure my food is touched with bare hands at restaurants more than I probably realize ... but when I asked the bartender if that's what I really saw, she gave me the excuse \"That's all he touches. That's his spot.\" (yeah right - hard to believe he stands there like a statue all night and only places his impecably clean hands on food alone.) so I replied \"he isn't supposed to be wearing gloves?\" 

No gloves in my own kitchen .... fine.
No gloves in a restaurant .... totally grossed out. 

Come on, even the Subway two doors down from this place puts on gloves every single time.

Offering to remake my food would have been nice. Still undecided if I'll be back - and that's saying a lot since they have a ton of great beer on tap and I could avoid ordering food.

Beware chef does not wear gloves!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! Great food, great drinks, and amazing bartenders! Karl, Thomas, Paul are hardworking and friendly. Can't get enough of them!"}
{"text":"I got the Shepards pie (flavorless) and seafood chowder (also wouldn't recommend). Hubby got the pub burger which was good but nothing special. If you get a mule make sure to pay extra for good vodka. Overall bland food. The atmosphere was fun though. Id recommend this place for beers and maybe some apps but not dinner."}
{"text":"Well once again Irish Wolfhound is up to it's sleazy ways by selective discrimination!  It is unbelievable that people continue to patronize an establishment that does not appreciate its customers, especially women!"}
{"text":"Our 1st time here. 730 on a Saturday night and place wasn't packed, you seat yourself. Fast friendly service and food delivery. Bathrooms are clean as is the restaurant. Jenna took care of us explaining the specials and other options. One of the best Rubens we have ever had! Pair it with a Kilt Lifter from one of our local breweries and you have a perfect meal. Portions are good, we split the Ruben and fries and were plenty full. We will be coming back for sure. It was odd that they were playing country music over the speakers. Band had not setup yet."}
{"text":"Came out here ~2 times a week for trivia and drinks with friends for over 2.5 years (Sun & Wed).  Always a great atmosphere, older crowd but fun, and staff were always amazing.  Highly recommend to anyone in the local area."}
{"text":"Very good authentic food. I will definitely be going back again. Love the soups!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here. Live bands, great food, and a good time!"}
{"text":"Get the 3 slider plate, best of all the sandwiches. Reuben is my favorite."}
{"text":"My boyfriend, myself, and our two friends came in for dinner Thursday night. 920pm. 

We're in our late twenties (27/28) and early 30s. 

Our designated driver, had left his wallet at home. So, we were understanding when Jessica said she wouldn't serve us for dinner. 

We decided we'd order to go then. 

We asked Jessica if we can have waters while we waited the food to be made to go, and she declined saying she wasn't allowed because our one guest didn't have ID. 

It's against Arizona law to deny water. 

However, as this was all going on, one of the patrons (a blonde woman) was inexplicably drunk. Clearly intoxicated, stumbling and slurring her speech while the bar was still serving her more alcohol. The car keys draped around her neck should have been a sign. 

All four of us patrons have worked in the service industry and own our own businesses now. 

We immediately left because we were appalled to see what happened.

We went to State 48 which had excellent service, drinks, and food. 

I hope that all four of us call the day manager to explain the situation; it's not okay for a human being (Jessica) to treat us with such poor communication and interaction, nor was it okay to witness a woman be served past her limit. 
After leaving this review on Facebook, I was blocked by the bar. 

I think it's my civic duty to make sure this information is widespread."}
{"text":"My hubby and I have always loved this place, from the great food and choice of drinks to the entertainment and staff and the huge outdoor patio. Last night I had a little too much fun and left my purse at the bar (Don't judge) :)

Anyways, when I called at 11 as soon as they opened, it was a HUGE relief to hear it was there. At no point have I ever had any reason to doubt the integrity of the staff, but I was completely floored to see not one thing, not $1 was missing.  I'm so thankful and lucky and impressed. Andi, my favorite bartender said \" If you're gonna leave your purse behind anywhere,  this is the place to do it because everyone that works here is awesome\". She is absolutely right! Thx to you all."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Authentic Irish. Charming waitress!

We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Ok, came here to enjoy happy hour and the service was ok?  Waitress really did not want to help us, she rather be somewhere else for sure.  
I have had better times in other bars, outdoor patios than here so I must only rate this an ok place.  Wish I could give it a higher rating? Why you ask?  The place is nice, just the service is ugh and the crowd.  Wish it could be a younger crowd, but it seems to attract Sun City here and not Surprise.  Luckily the patio is big so our group could be far from the other patrons."}
{"text":"Friendly service, good vibes and location. The staff here is accommodating and an example is the manager allowing my girl to get a lunch special not usually prepared on the weekend. The chicken wings, fish sliders, potato soup, and salmon are great dishes. The bread pudding is an awesome dessert! Hot and delicious!"}
{"text":"Cool place! Great beer selection, comfortable outdoor patio with heaters and TVs. Food was awesome, I had a burger with chips that I would definitely order again. Will be back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Where do I start. My retirement party was held here. From what I remember and what I have been told, I had a fantastic time. I do remember apologizing to our waitress at the beginning of the evening in case I wasn't able to later. They gave us the pool room. The staff was very attentive. Someone was checking in with us constantly. The appetizers were delicious. My favorite was the Reuben Sliders. I don't remember much past 8:30. A great place for most functions. I have also been here on Fri. & Sat. for their \"All-you-can-eat Guinness Batter Fish & Chips\". Not frozen fish sticks. Good size chunks of fresh cod. Some of the best in the valley. Top the evening off with some of Dan's Amazing Bread Pudding. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"There is nothing not to like about this place. The decor has items brought from Ireland and they try to keep it true to the Irish Pub tradition, though it is larger than a typical pub.

The food is scratch made, authentically Irish and decently priced. The Reuben fritters are amazing and the Potato Leek soup is delicious. The Guinness  Steak and Mushroom Pie is super yummy and worth the time (it takes 25 minutes).

Their beer selection is good and they have an ample Whiskey choices.

The co-owners who manage the place (Dave and Amy) are fantastic people and the service is always on point.

They have live music most weekends and a calendar on their web site to let you know who is playing. The crowd changes a lot based on the time of day. It trends older at dinner times, but younger when the bands are playing and around happy hour."}
{"text":"My wife and I are big Royals fans so come to Surprise nearly every year for spring training.  The Irish Wolfhound is always one of the places we stop at and eat before heading to the game.  The food, service and atmosphere are great."}
{"text":"Arrive right at 3 as lunch specials end. Waitress attitude was of well.
 We left
 She was rude, spend my money where I'm appreciated."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, Guinness was delicious and the Corned Beef and cabbage hit the spot. Great service! Happy St. Patty's Day"}
{"text":"Such a cool atmosphere, they have darts, pool, and a HUGE COMFY patio (Comfy as in it has couches on the patio, no way right!?!?). 

Fun and friendly staff make this place feel like a good old tavern

Just make sure you get there early if you want to get a table outside on the weekend."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night. There were four people in my party.

We arrived at around 7PM. When we got inside, the hostess wasn't there, but a nice girl let us know that she would be back momentarily. She got there a few minutes later and asked if we'd like to sit inside or outside. We opted for the patio. She asked if we were all over 21 (?). Not sure why. She let us know to just seat ourselves. Fine...

We sit down and waited about 15 minutes for a waitress to take our drink order. When she finally arrived, she also asked us if we were all over 21. We nodded, since we were. She took everyone's drink orders (everyone ordered beer), and when she got to me, she said, \"I'm going to need to see everyone's IDs.\" Why is it that two separate people asked if we were over 21, but didn't  bother checking IDs? Odd. 

I ordered Smithwicks (awesome beer) and the all you can eat fish fry. The fish was good, but they literally give you two tiny pieces of fish for every plate. It would make more sense to give more fish on the first plate, and less on the subsequent plates.
The french fry's were okay, but the coleslaw was HORRENDOUS! There was no dressing on it whatsoever. They put dry cabbage on a plate and called it coleslaw. 

The pricey food coupled with the below average service, along with the lack of effort put into the food gives this establishment two stars. I would only return for the Irish Beer (and any Irish pub can supply that)."}
{"text":"We love this place and it USE to have terrific food.  They must have changed chefs or the old one just doesn't care any more.  We were there yesterday afternoon.  I ordered chicken tenders and they were so overcooked (all breading, NO chicken) that I sent them back.  My husband ordered the seafood chowder which, at one time, was amazing but he got a green pasty soup that was barely OK.  His beef and brie sliders were very overcooked.  I know they probably slack off with summer but this is bad.  I've always told people that they have the best fish & chips, now I don't think I will."}
{"text":"Amazing food and fun atmosphere with the pool table room and the occasional live bands that play. The bartenders aren't always that friendly which sucks as I am a bartender as well and have high standards for service. I love the bangers and mash! Yum! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Slow service at the bar, where the bartender (yes just one) seemed more interested in hanging out with the regular crowd than servicing new customers.  

The Food - less than satisfactory. House salad had wilted lettuce (a peeve of mine). It was not crisp, it was soggy, contained brown spots, and undesirable chunks. The asiago cheese on the salad is a miss. Uncooked asiago is too strong and should not be treated like parmesan. The croutons on the salad were lackluster despite being the only crunchy item and tasting garlicky (needed a salty component).

Seafood chowder was okay. It was not served hot, it was tepid, like bathwater that sat too long. It also had a vinegar or sour note, which is not something I want when eating chowder. The soup lacked the quantity of large fish chunks (only 1 whole shrimp and 1 large chunk salmon).

The soda bread starred for the meal as a tasty and dense treat on the plate.

The chicken wings tasted good, but despite my instruction for crispy wings, I found them to be over-sauced and soggy. They also lacked spice, an essential quality for great wings. but ultimately not crispy and not very spicy. Another negative: the server brought ranch instead of blue cheese. She noticed after serving us. Why can't runners, servers, and bartenders take 5 seconds before delivering food to the customer to check it? 

This is definitely not a place I would go out of my way to eat at. However, they have fantastic patio space which is great for summer or winter!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place 3 stars because the staff was nice. The food was overpriced and greasy/mushy, and the happy hour drink specials were very sad."}
{"text":"The curry chips are addicting the curry itself was like a cross between and Indian styled and a Japanese style curry.  The fish n chips were large and delicious, the red chicken breasts boxty were great with the goat cheese part of the sauce not a major detriment to the overall flavor."}
{"text":"Been to several bars/restaurants and everytime I go into this place I just never seem to like it. Whether it be the service, the atmosphere, the food or most recently the security guards on a sat. night that were dressed like cops that seemed to be hovering over anyone at the bar they felt had been there too long. They actually went up to a couple and I believe cut them off from drinking...? I have no clue what this was about as I had never seen this before?  I just can't seem to get into this place. No wow factor, no good feeling.. nothing that makes me want to go back. Just bla...Alot more upbeat happier places to get a drink and good food."}
{"text":"What a fabulous find since moving to AZ!  Love the employees and the Reuben sandwich is always a favorite... great happy hour too"}
{"text":"Great beer selection.  Nice atmosphere   Terrible vegetarian options.  Salads are not very good."}
{"text":"No complaints. The food is great and the two servers we had were fantastic. There was an error with one  of the meals and they were fantastic about solving the issue and replaced the meal. 
We are heading back here again tonight so if you enjoy Irish Pubs, head here for sure."}
{"text":"Very casual bar with acceptable food which I enjoy.  HOWEVER, they served the worse tasting Margarita I have ever had. TERRIBLE
Time to go there is on St. Patricks Day."}
{"text":"In town for a visit. Had some time to kill around lunch. Did a yelp search and this bar popped up, with pretty good reviews. Ordered the slider trio and curry chips. Both were awesome. Beer was ice cold, the bartender and service was excellent! Sad that it's not my local bar. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came here per recommendation from a client. Nice place on the inside, but not enough servers make service extremely slow, which is not ideal when you're thirsty. Also, the food wasn't too good.  I had the Reuben and maybe got halfway through it. The meat just was not appetizing from the first bite. The soup was good though, I got chicken noodle. My bill was $21 for a bowl of soup, a Sprite, and a Reuben that isn't better than a Reuben from Subway. Maybe the food tastes better when you are drinking, but I don't drink. I'm not going to be returning to this location for a meal unless I'm dragged here by a client."}
{"text":"Went here for my daughter's birthday.  Prime rib was good, buffalo chicken salad good, pub burger over cooked but tasty.  Real complaint was the fish and chips, fryer needed to have oil changed and absolutely no taste to the fish the overpowering burnt taste just ruined my appetite and feelings on what I thought was a cool little joint."}
{"text":"It's been one of my favs for several years. Above average food, spot-on drinks, plenty ot TVs inside and out. I'm picky about fish but their Friday Fish Fry is the best around, the cod is delicious. The customer service is excellent 90% of the time."}
{"text":"Been passing by this place for the past 5 years and finally checked it out. What an interesting place. I went to the bar to order a couple of carry out dinners. The menus are in the form of an old news paper which I thought was interesting. I had several questions which the bar tender kindly helped me out with. While i waited for the order to be prepared I thought I'd order a beer. They have a huge selection of beers from all over the world. When confronted with an assortment of such I like to order something I've never tried before. The bartender was friendly and helpful. He once again answered my questions and helped me choose a beer that I may like. They also have a way to help make this choice a bit easier by having you pick three beers for one order. Each of the three bees come in smaller glasses with an ampule amount to make a decision.
The food was packed well and plenty warm enough to eat when I got home. All  selections were fair in size and delicious. All in all I spent about 25 mins there and it was most enjoyable. I recommend this place and look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Best fish and chips I've ever had. 
I am a F&C lover. This beer-battered, ATLANTIC ( more flavorful than Pacific  Cod ) F&C meal was de-lish. A little more expensive than most, but the Atlantic Cod generally costs restaurants more. It was so worth it. Served with wedge-style fries & coleslaw ( not a  slaw fan ) and home-made tartar. Order it if you are in the mood, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is most horrible Irish restaurant we had experience to dine. The food was tasteless and bland :( it seems that cook doesn't care about the quality of the food, look and seasoning. Eating at a school cafeteria would be a better experience. What a shame!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place I really really do. Its one of the only Irish pubs on the West side that is still around. I've been to quite a few around the valley and they seem to keep closing up. 

Ok, to the food which I weight the highest to rate my experience. I used to eat here quite a bit when they first opened and the food was really good. Then all that went down hill really fast which was disappointing. I'm not sure if it was cut backs, poor cooks, mismanagement or a mix but the food quality took a nose dive. The staff was always nice and the atmosphere is really cool. I do love that they have bands that come in and play which ads to the ambiance.

The last 5 times I've been there the food wasn't that great. Just seemed to turn into average bar food. My wife and I kept coming back because we figured they had an off night and we wanted to keep giving it a chance. We have eaten our last meal at the Wolfhound and unfortunately wont be back.

Pros: good for drinks, band, atmosphere, staff is nice
Cons: average bar food"}
{"text":"Brian, Carl,  and Kristy are amaze -balls they are totes-mcgotes the bestest bartenders ever!!! Plus Cody is always a friendly face around the bar helping and making everyone feel welcome! !"}
{"text":"Service is always quick and friendly. Terrible fish and chips, it's one nasty filet that is soggy under the over done breading. The philly cheese steak is amazing. My husband loves the bangers and mash. It's overpriced so it's not really a first choice place for me."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre, the staff was awful. I came in and they looked right at me and never acknowledged me. When I finally was able to get their attention i didn't feel very welcome. I ordered the shepherds pie and it comes with soda bread. I spent a few weeks over in Ireland last year and I can say from first hand experience that the soda bread does taste very authentic. So that's a plus. But the shepherds pie was mediocre as it appeared to come with some cheap meat. Overall it wasn't a great experience and I was bummed given that I'm heavily influenced by my Irish heritage."}
{"text":"First time here and very good. I had the fish and chips and I m a F&C snob and theirs is very good. I am also very picky bout my coleslaw and this was very good. My love had the ruben and he enjoyed it. Fry's we're great and the potato leek was very good. Only down side was the soda bread was ice cold and they don't have Dr. Pepper  The service was very good although I think there was only one server. Alicia was very nice and funny. We will be back there were items on the menu we are excited to try"}
{"text":"Fun place to go. Nice energy and great service. Food is a little above average for \"bar\" food. Portions could be better on some items but overall its a great place. 

Have had several menu items and all tasted fine. Fish special was so so. Found the grease levels pretty high. Maybe that's OK if your drinking a lot of Guinness?

Servers are top notch. Always fun and lots of positive energy.

Trying to make it a weekly place is hard with so many area options.

Prefer lunch as its not elbow to elbow plus they have several lunch specials."}
