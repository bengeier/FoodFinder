{"text":"We went for dinner on a Sunday afternoon. Looking at the outside, weren't sure it was the best. We met a very Italian man with a pizza box in the parking lot and he said the pizza there was the best. We decided to give it a try. Loved the breads in a basket with assorted olives and the balsamic vinegar and olive oil for dipping. My friend got a great salad with Pasta Faggioli. She wanted more beans in it. My friend and I shared the greek salad and the vegetarian lasagna. (Thrilled they had a vegetarian menu).The sauce was fabulous, the noodles thin and the stuffing excellent. Best meal we had on our weekend in Toronto. The restaurant is older but was rather formal. The waitress made us laugh at her uptight antics. When asked if the jalapeño bread was hot, she said, \"taste it and if you don't like it, don't eat it\". When we asked for more bread, she wordlessly grabbed the basket and disappeared. She did come back but weren't sure if we made her mad. Then, when we went to pay, we said we wanted to pay individually. She looked annoyed and grabbed the ticket, coming back with our individual costs but scolded us like kids that if we wanted an individual bill, it's always better for people to let a waitress know before she writes up a ticket. We ignored her and just enjoyed the meal and bread. We found this restaurant with our GPS because we got tired of paying for parking in Toronto and were thrilled we didn't have to pay for parking and a meal too. Glad we didn't see these previous bad reviews and we tried it."}
{"text":"This restaurant was very good. We went there for lunch and started with the calamari. It was very good, crispy and not too oily. The fried basil was a nice touch. 
After that we had 2 Italian panini sandwiches: the chicken and spicy sicilian. Both were very good, packed with veggies and meat and very filling. 
My only complaint: DO NOT ask them for Sangria. We asked and they said they could make it and we had some terrible mixture of bad wine and juice. Just undrinkable. 
We sat outside on their patio and that was enjoyable. The service was also good. Straight to the point but pleasant."}
{"text":"I've always loved Italian food and was getting sick of the bastardized version I found far too often. Henry Hill, one of our favorite Goodfellas, aptly shared my frustration of ordering spaghetti and marinara sauce and receiving egg noodles and ketchup - you couldn't be more right Henry. Then I walked into Rocco's and found the place I had been looking for all my life. The food is authentic, owners friendly and the atmosphere makes for a perfect date night. I'd recommend the risotto, any pasta with rose sauce and the calamari. It just tastes like an authentic Italian meal and makes me understand why Henry spent so much time in a life of crime. I would too if I could have regular access to food like this!"}
{"text":"I love it here they really make you feel like family and the food is amazing! I always order the rose pasta with shrimp scallops and goat cheese yum"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Rocco's since the mid 90's. What makes this place so special? It's a combination of the food, the atmosphere and the service. There are three locations and I personally think the Queensway is the best. It's the most authentic. As soon as you arrive, the server gives you a basket of bread and olives. If you eat the entire basket, they will fill it up for you again - same goes for the olives. I usually start off with the grilled veggies or Rocco's favourite salad. My main is either the Penne or the Rigatoni vegetable. Enjoyed with a nice glass of Ruffino red wine. You can request whole wheat pasta if you choose to. Your bill comes with some yummy Italian candies that I usually throw in my purse only to discover them a few weeks later. Rocco's is also a fantastic place to go on a first date. Just make sure you make a reservation or you'll be waiting in line"}
{"text":"Amazing Italian food, great service, overall nothing bad to say. Actually, if I had to nit pick the décor could use an overhaul, there's a bit of an awkward area when you walk in you're almost standing in the middle of the dining area (ish). All in all, a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Always come in for take out, have never ate in, great pasta every time. The gentleman with the glasses always seems happy and never annoyed when we come in, even when they're near closing."}
{"text":"Food is OK. Not really much choices, there menu could use updating. The customer service is awful. will not be going back or ordering takeout (which was a nightmare to order) from them again."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. First time here and love their pasta. Tried the shrimp and scallop risotto. Creamy and rich with generous amount of juicy mushroom scallop and shrimp. The smoked salmon fusilli was very nice too. Had a good feeling about this restaurants starting with the bread and olives. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I want to really like this place. I want to like it for the crazy wooden sign and the really awesome server we got last night and the delicious olive oil with balsamic vinegar we got with the bread. I want to love it for the wonderful time I had.

But I have issues with mis-placed expectations. I'm trying to work on it. So poor Rocco gets 3 stars, because I can't bear to give it 2. 

Are there people in the windows? That's because the lights aren't on in the rest of the restaurant. It's deads-ville back there and who wants to eat in the dark? Go to the window: natural light and something to look at besides the slightly bewildering interior decorating. 

As I mentioned, the server was swell, a real nice guy. My Other wanted something not on the menu - hey no problem. I wanted the girliest drink available - try the Kanadian Koolaid. Need a lighter - here you go, see you in a few. 

The menu gets a sad face though. Lots of things in italics - but all the appetizers are seafood? Or salad? The thing not on the menu we ordered was spaghetti bolognese... not on the menu? Then it's two hard to read menus of equal length - one printed off (but looks like a couple of years ago), the other laminated. I defaulted to the gnocchi so that I could stop reading already.

Then the food. Bread, as said before, yum. Great olive oil and balsamic vinegar mix with other spices. 

The gnocchi was, again, one of those things I want to love so badly. But reality crashes through the Kanadian Koolaid and it's really a one-note sauce of parmesan rose with a lot of parmesan slathered over chewy gnocchi. The sauce was tasty, but it was tasty because parmesan is tasty, not because there was anything else to it. The gnocchi was tasty because gnocchi is tasty, but the texture was difficult and made the heavy sauce even heavier.

I didn't eat the whole plate of spaghetti, but from the couple of forkfuls I scored and the review of the Other, it was good food, but bland food.

Dinner came to $42 +tip (earned!) without any appetizer, but with a monstrous cocktail.

So it's an okay place. It's got okay food and okay atmosphere. It's got an amazing server and a fun sign outside. It's kinda expensive, but definitely not the most I've ever paid for so-so Italian."}
{"text":"I arranged a wedding shower at Rocco's. A small group of women.The food was TERRIBLE. My pasta was a teeny portion and the cream sauce was milk. No taste. Dessert was a mushy cake. The place was musty smelling and we were the only patrons. This used to be such a great place!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Groupon and had a pretty good experience. Service was good. Food was good - not the best Italian I've had but definitely worth a try! 

I agree with previous reviews that the decor is kind of overdone - it looks like they're trying too hard to make it look Italian."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, and the service has always been top notch.
They also make you feel like a celebrity :)
The food is delicious, and the portions are big, so there is a good chance you might take some of the food home.
It is very crowded on the weekends, so the seating could be very tight.
However, if you are going on the weekdays, the place is very quiet.
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are picky customers. We travel a lot and often try different restaurants. We have been at this location and their other location several times and have tried several items off the menu. We can't find any problem with this restaurant.  The menu items are all prepared well and unlike some other Toronto restaurants, the meal portions are quite generous so you never end up leaving unsatisfied.
The food quality and excellent service here keep us going back."}
{"text":"First time at the restaurant and I loved it! The food and atmosphere is great - not too noisy on a weeknight. I ordered an arugula salad to start followed by sea bass and lobster tail as my main. Can't end off an Italian dinner without tiramisu which was super authentic and delicious. The owner came by to check on our table which gave it a nice touch. Offered us grappa on the house. Perfect end to our meal! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Well the place looks great daytime and night. I love the twinkle lights at the front of the restaurant and the eclectic decor. 

I had the Angel Pasta with Chicken breast in a rosa sause. It was Yum yum good, I ate it all. 

I would of had a dessert but I was already full, I shouldn't have had and bread and olive oil before the main dish. Oh well....

I highly recommend Rocco's Plum Tomato, great food at good prices and nice people."}
{"text":"Never buy a groupon or any discount coupon from this restaurant. We enjoyed our meal there once and the next time we went with our coupon, they had a notice on the door that they were no longer honouring these. I did get my money back from Groupon, just think that the restaurant conveniently decides that when business is slow, they won't honour them."}
{"text":"This was the first time here.  The atmosphere is very nice and service good. Had seen this restaurant a lot especially on the Queensway, always thought I would try this place one day so when a deal came up on groupon - I couldn't resist.

Took the family here today for our first 2015 dinner, overall it was good but some complaints are that its a bit pricey for the portion sizes you get.

I ordered the soup of the day which was the seafood chowder, it was so so.   ordered a Cesar salad which was, in my opinion, way too expensive for what you  got. My daughter and I ordered the grill chicken on speggatti in cream sauce it was okay but again the portion just not worth the price. Too little for your dollar.  My wife had the fusselli  with smoked-Salmon which she enjoyed again only complaint is the portion size.  Not enough food for your money.

Overall, it's a nice place but a bit too expensive for the portion sizes."}
{"text":"Food was horrible sauce tasted like it was from a can. 25 for veal parmigiano what a joke undercooked penne pasta. Cmon an Italian restaurant that can't cook pasta. Stay away food horrible. To add to horrible food roof leaking like a waterfalls. Fine dining what a joke. Grab a can of chef boyardee better taste and save 150 bucks"}
{"text":"I want to start by saying i liked this place... great portions ...good taste and nice atmosphere but one night and that all changes for ever and ever.  We ordered our appetizers and ate all the bread and oil and were waiting for our main meal when as we were sitting against the wall near the mantle a cockroach was sitting literally staring  at us .... no doubt....  we call over the girl who seated us she ran away and at the same time the room busboy came with a cloth and squuezed him to death with a cloth .. we saw only one and it was killed but we were turned off !!!!  We asked for the food we just go because we just couldnt take it .... what we saw and the reaction of staff....so we asked for it too be put to Go..  The waitet comes over and says i asked the manager to comp your appetizers after what u saw.  Here is my point. why couldn't the manager come and apologize and say something and actually considering we asked to leave why did we even pay but i guess thats another issue all together.....   very dissapointed ...."}
{"text":"Good basic Italian food, pizza and sandwiches are great!  Pasta dishes and entrées are pretty basic imho,  the baked goat cheese salad was delicious!"}
{"text":"We just celebrated a baby shower on September 27, 2015 and Rocco's is a venue that I can recommend to others who are looking to host a party.  We had 50 people attend and the food was very good, the servers were excellent and very accommodating."}
{"text":"Great food. Try the linguini with shrimp and scallop.  A sure winner!  Accompanied with a glass of Pinot. Yummy"}
{"text":"Main course was amazing! Appetizers are worth skipping (because they were so-so, the main is yummy enough & you get bread anyways)
Service was on point. The only thing we noticed was one of our side plates was dirty but they exchanged it right away when we asked. Also, drink refills (especially the water) was just right!"}
{"text":"After a long day of travel we stumbled upon this restaurant. We decided to stay and we're pleasantly rewarded. The food was delicious, reasonable and the waitstaff attentive. The menu was full and varied. I would recommend."}
{"text":"I have been to Rocco's a few times in the past 10 years. The food used to be good, but it isn't anymore. 

I recently went there with my family and was really disappointed with the food. The place has really gone downhill in my opinion. We all ordered different pizzas and they were bland and mediocre tasting. They did not taste like they were authentic at all. The ingredients on the pizza tasted old and did not have much flavour. The sauce tasted like it was from a can. Compared to other Italian restaurants I have been to, their pizza was over priced and not very tasty. I will not be going here again."}
{"text":"My favourite Italian restaurant. I always get the same dish, the chicken parmigiana with pasta in rose sauce. Delicious and a good sized portion. I think I've always been too full for dessert so I will have to try that sometime. Even the bread they give you is delicious! Cute little spot, great for dates or family dinners."}
{"text":"A friend took me here for a Birthday dinner. I had their excellent veal sandwiches before but never been in the dining room. As we arrived the hostess wished me a happy birthday. We ordered grilled Calamari to start and both of us ordered Rack Of Lamb with a side of carbonara pasta. As we waited for the Calamari we were given a selection of fresh bread and olive oil with balsamic vinegar. The calamari did not take to long and was cooked to perfection as was the lamb when it came. The pasta was nicely al dente.  Serrvice was top notch. Polite ,not overly familiar,and the man knew the menu well. The decor was also most pleasant with beautiful would carvings accenting the tiled walls. A class operation."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the duck with a side of veggies.  The veggies (as you can see in my photo) were super fresh and cooked perfectly.  I've noticed that a side of veggies these days tend to be a few green beans with a few slices of carrots and they are always overcooked.  My side veggies included carrots, green beans, broccoli, zucchini, bok choy, grilled red pepper and roasted/fried potato wedges.  This place knows how to cook the duck breast so that its not tough at all.  The sauce was yummelicious.  The spicy caesar did not need any cool skewer of pickled items or funky seafood.  That caesar stood on its own."}
{"text":"subpar italian food. Buy a bag of rotini, some cherry tomatos, jarred sundried tomatoes, and jarred pesto at the grocery store and that's that."}
{"text":"I ordered my veal like I always do but this time I had it to dine in. So it took 10 mins for the laddy to bring my cooked veal to my bread. By the time i got my sandwich it was cold not how it was like before. Now this is the Only reason it get 3 stars cause this is the only mess up I have ever had with this place"}
{"text":"Had eaten here once before earlier in the day, and liked it, but I must say, it is much better at night because of the atmosphere improvement when there's a crowd and live singing.  As soon as I stepped in the second time, and saw/heard their live jazz/Sinatra style crooner, I was impressed.  He wasn't too dominating, just in the back, but very nice to listen to....

Anyhoo...

Great service.  If they aren't a family, they act like they are.  Greeted immediately with passion.  Server was enthusiastic but not annoying.  Attentive but not over-bearing.  :)

Interesting atmosphere with random wooden sculptures on the wall, Italian artwork, bricks on one wall, tile on another, but not tacky.

Two rounds of breads with oil & balsamic, with olives.  

Wide menu selection where I'm sure anybody could find something they like.  Had a special insert page with a $20 special where you could get salad, entree & dessert. So I did.  Very good Caesar.  I'd forgotten to request no bacon bits (vegetarian), but fortunately it didn't come with any and was flavorful enough to not need any.  My gnocchi was good...semi-bland, but that's how it's supposed to be.  Lemon blueberry cheesecake was very good.  I left feeling satisfied but not too full....basically just right.

Got a $41 bottle of pinot grigio.  Forget the name but was good.

Definitely go back here.  Our neighborhood doesn't have a ton of selection for decent sit-down restaurants, so I picked it because I didn't feel like driving far.  But for a local \"chain\" that has a few in the city, it's decent."}
{"text":"BEST VEAL SANDWICH IN TORONTO!

NOTE: This review is for the take-out section of Rocco's.


I have to admit I have never eaten in the restaurant itself.  I always go to the takeout section to get their delicious veal sandwiches.  This is Toronto's best kept secret for Veal Sandwiches.   I know there are California Sandwich die-hard fans out there who will swear California's makes the best sandwich.  I eat at California's as well but it's a close second.  IMO Rocco's sandwich has more flavour and California's are larger.  At Rocco's all the toppings are free except cheese so you can load your sandwich.  If you did the same at California's you would be paying about $11-12 dollars for the sandwich.  That is pushing it a bit if you ask me.  

I think the main reason why Rocco's edges out California is the cheese and peppers on the sandwich.  Rocco's uses Parmesan cheese while California uses Provolone cheese.  Parmesan is more flavorful (same cheese used on Pizza) thus yielding a better tasting sandwich.  The same goes for the peppers.

The sandwiches are large and filling (not as large as California's).  And the price is right.  I believe it's around the $8 dollar mark.  I can't remember because I'm too busy staring and salivating at the sandwich to notice how much it costs!

special note:  Myself and my coworkers (who happen to be die-hard California sandwich fans did a taste test as follows.  We ordered medium veal sandwiches with cheese and mushrooms.  The consensus was unanimous - Rocco's tastes a little better but California's was more filling.  Some of them have converted, others have not.

That's my 2 cents.  Give it a shot and let me know what you think."}
{"text":"We went there for dinner, food and the wine were amazing but they do not know what a machiato coffee is. They charged us $12 for two coffees that looked like cappucino first. My husband, who is from Rome and born there not the Canadian Italian wishing they were born there,  said is there milk in this coffee ? The  lovely waitress  said yes . Sorry it doesn't come with milk only a drop of foam.  We go to Starbuck and pay  $5.55 for two double expresso machiato  That price for coffee is way too much."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for years, whether it is for a birthday, New Year's Eve, Mother's Day,  Father's Day, entertaining friends or even when there is no occasion!  The food is always superb!  As soon as you are seatted, you are served with a glass of water. Then they give you a plate with a variety of bread from St. Remo Bakery and olives with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. My favourite bread is the one with hot peppers!  They don't have a lot of it so make you sure that you call dibs on it! We start off with their fried calamari with spinach. Then our favourite entres are Linguine with Mixed Seafood, Risotto Shrimp, Duck and Linguine with Wild Mushrooms in Cream Sauce (not on their menu but they cook it for us). They have a variety of desserts but our all time favourite is their Tiramisu! The portions are big so be prepared to have a doggie bag. The service is very good especially from our server, Arbin and manager, Tipan.  Arbin goes out if his way to ensure that you enjoy your dinner. 
Will I recommend this restaurant? Absolutely!!! Will we come back? A resounding, Yes!!!"}
{"text":"We went to the Queensway restaurant to use our ncrowd coupon we had purchased early.  I had called earlier and was informed that NCROWD had gone out of business and that the coupon would only be worth what we paid for it.  Under the circumstances, I understood and wanted to try the place anyways.  We shared the second pizza on the menu with mushrooms, artichokes, prosciutto cheeses.....it was great, with thin crust and fabulous tastes.  We also ordered Penne with Bolognese meat sauce that was not on the menu...also a great dish with great flavours.  Definitely will be back!  Shame on NCrowd for bailing out on this restaurant....I guess you have to be careful who you buy from....."}
{"text":"SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!! We went to this place last night and the first off when you walk in there is no host to greet you we had to go up to the bar for them to tell us where we can sit. Ended up going outside to the patio and we first decided to sit on the upper level of the patio but when we got there spider webs everywhere on the table and chairs IT WAS GROSS. The waitress told us they haven't had a chance to clean it up (OK THEN WHY OPEN IT UP FOR CUSTOMERS). Anyways We order appetizer and dinner (Grilled Calamari appetizer $11.95) shrimp risotto ($18.95) and Mushroom risotto (14.95). Totally forgot about the appetizer brought the dinner which was cold and the shrimp was rubbery. When we mentioned that we where still waiting for appetizer they where like \"OH THEY ARE MAKING IT NOW\"  Brought out the calamari it was over cooked and was masked with the worst balsamic Anyways I'm going to stop there and just want to say that this place is not worth it I understand that the Service industry is hard but if I'm going to your establishment and spending my hard earned money I am expected to see a clean place and food cooked properly Please next time pay attention to your customer and you won't be getting such bad reviewes."}
{"text":"Made reservations for an early evening dinner on Saturday night for 5 adults and a toddler.
When ordering we asked for the toddler's meal to be brought with the
appetizers. This did not happen. One appetizer came and the next followed many many minutes later but still no toddler meal. When asked were told that there was a large party in the back and the kitchen had
many meals to serve. Our main meals did not arrive till one and a half hours after they were ordered. The pizzas were undercooked. 
The parents and the toddler had to ask to have their meals \"to go\"!
This is not acceptable!!
If the restaurant could not handle the large party and other patrons then the reservations should not have been accepted. Or, we should have been told up front that the the waiting time for our meals would be lengthy. This way we could have chosen to stay or go elsewhere.
The waitress was very apologetic. It was not really her fault as she can only bring out the dishes when they are ready for serving.
Do not think we would go to this location again. The food is very good,though, when it does arrive. The Islington location seems to have
better service and much much shorter wait times for meals."}
{"text":"My family has been going to Rocco's Plum Tomato for 20 years now and it never fails to impress.

The food is absolutely divine. Great pizza, and I would even go as far to say they serve the best chicken parmigiana ever (make sure to get a side of penne with rosée sauce). 

They are very generous with the delicious bread (and olive/pepper bread) they give before your meal, which is a welcomed change from many restaurants I have eaten at that only give 1 piece per person. 

Be careful with dishes that indicate they have spice to them as they really do mean spicy, but the chefs have no problem adjusting the level of heat to your liking. 

The restaurant is very cozy and the service is warm and friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Been here numerous times and enjoyed many different dishes.

Their calamari is killer and you get quite a large serving. Mussels are amazing as well as the bread that goes with it. 

I love the veal picatta or scalopini, I have had both. Awesome. 

Not very pricey and has a nice Italian decor."}
{"text":"I am officially a regular at Rocco's on Islington!

I absolutely love their seafood risotto and the risotto half lobster is excellent too.  

We found some coupons on DineTO for $10 off per PERSON!!!  I have now used them 4 times (and I went there without the coupons fairly often before that).  

My 4 year old is an EXTREMELY discerning eater, but she adores their chicken pasta (spaghettini if I remember correctly) in a rose sauce.  She will even choose that over their pizza, which is good too!

My only issue when I go there is choosing from their enormous menu.

We often go with our 4 year old and 1 year old and they are really great with children.  They have crayons and colouring pages.

We went with our entire family after my baby's baptism and everybody enjoyed it.

One night, I went with a girlfriend and there was a singer, which really enhanced the already nice atmosphere.

If you didn't like it the first time you tried it, give it another chance! I've been at least 10x and we've never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"We used to be very frequent patrons of Rocco's, but after an unpleasant experience during our last visit two years ago, we have stayed away.  We decided to try it again last night.

When we walked in, the place had a terrible smell that almost made us leave.  It smelled like really bad cheese and/or fish.  We all decided (hoped) that it must have been something they were cooking, and sat down anyway.  

We were seated by the window.  Part-way through our meal, we noticed that there were bugs crawling all over the windowsill beside us. Ewww...

Our appetizer of grilled shrimp cost $14, and there were only three smallish shrimp on the plate. Very overpriced.  Thankfully our mains were all very tasty.  No complaints.  Service was great -- no complaints there, either.

They really need to shut this place down for a few days and give it a thorough scrubbing from top to bottom.  It feels dirty and sticky ... not to mention the issue of the bugs and the smell.

Sorry, Rocco's!  We really want to love you the way we used to!  Nobody does chicken parm like you!"}
{"text":"Used to be very on point, slowly going down the drain. Ordered 2 ceasars and 2 Penne Vodkas to only get home and see no dressing on the ceasar. Called said theyd put it in a cab, never came called back and said theyd issue a refund."}
{"text":"By the way tonite my family had the Halibut ..we usually order the famous Shrimp and Scallop Rose with goat cheese....so fresh ,we could taste the sea salt in the fish..it was really flaky and moist...the porcine mushroom risotto side was tasty and earthy..love the place ..."}
{"text":"This place looks great from the outside, has a nice big patio and has an excellent location at the corner of Markham and Bloor.  The staff have always been super friendly and are excellent in terms of service.

Then there's the negatives.  Rocco's is kind of dirty.  I've seen plenty of fruit flies hanging around tables on more than one occasion.  But I usually put that aside, telling myself that it's a nice place and the food will make up for it.

Unfortunately, this is usually not the case.  The food is very bland.  Maybe it's me, but I don't think so.  Prices aren't impressive either.  Even if the food was good, I'd still consider it overpriced.  Considering it's not that great, it's very overpriced.

Rocco's is a nice place to sit, but not a nice place to eat."}
{"text":"My 7-year old son said after his dinner: \"This is my new favourite restaurant. Can we come here everyday?\" 

We came for Sunday evening dinner at 5pm for first sitting, because we had our 2 young kids with us. The staff are as nice as they are good-looking (Wow! Every single one of them were gorgeous)...but the best thing about the service was that were very attentive without being overbearing. 

The food? Very good. My husband says you can always tell a restaurant's calibre by their steak alone, and while it was a rib-eye (not his favourite), he said it was very good. My chicken Parmegiana was tasty and my kids devoured their Margherita Pizza very happily. Did we mention that we also ordered the grilled Tiger shrimp and the fried calamari appetizer?  (We were hungry that night....plus we had a Groupon)  We even indulged on dessert - a slice of strawberry shortcake and a slice of the Triple chocolate mousse. I don't know where they get their desserts (do they make them? I don't know), they were delicious. 

Rocco himself made an appearance at another table, and there was a private party in the back room - it was busy, but the service was great.  The decor was....interesting....but somehow it all worked as a great setting for the entire experience. 

We will definitely be going back - my kids have already asked when. It's a family-friendly \"upscale casual\" spot - pretty hard to find."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service. 
I am hooked on the one of a kind calamari and have never had a dish there that I didn't absolutely love. 
Highly recommend"}
{"text":"On a Sunday afternoon of a long weekend, the service was slow, potentially the slowest service I've ever had in my entire life's existence.

It took about 2 hours to order sandwiches for a group of 6. If you are in a rush, do not come to this place when service is non-existent.

Service aside, the food was pretty good. I had a vegetarian sandwich - the grilled vegetables were layered and very flavourful. For 11.95, you cannot go wrong.

The bread that they serve in the beginning comes with a side of olives. Best tasting olives."}
{"text":"Delicious! Large portions - well worth the price! Amazing fried calamari!!! 
The stetchatella soup wasn't so good though. 
Veal with the Marsala and mushroom sauce was one of the better ones. Yumm
Delicioussss Rosè sauce!!
Very yummy Shrimp & Scallops Penne with Rosè sauce. It was al dente as well - which is how it should be. Thank you for perfecting that!"}
{"text":"Not the first time we have been here. It was not busy and the food did take forever to come. They still do not have a children's menu. The most annoying thing is we had a long day at a family outing and it was hot. When we arrivedm, all the doors in the place were open and it was very hot and muggy inside. We could not eat outside as people were smoking and we had our child. I asked why the fans and air conditioning were not on and was told because they were serving people on the patio they needed to stay open. This is absolute crap as other restaurants are able to manage a patio and have the air condition on. we ended up asking for our meal to go as we were to uncomfortable. Not cool..... literally!"}
{"text":"So I came back to Rocco's after maybe ...
12 years or so it's been a while !! 
Well I must say not bad ! I got the veal Marsala with risotto and a glass of chianti , oh mussels to start .
Food was fairly nice , my risotto was good .
Quality was decent 
service was a little slow 
atmosphere was mediocre .
I was a bit surprised at all the screaming kids in there ...am I missing something ? Is Friday nights here children's night out ? There was 5 separate tables with kids under 5 yes 5 we actually counted as we couldn't eat in peace so we figured why not after all it's. It like we can converse anyways with all the noise ! 
It was like Eating at an adult Chuck E Cheese ! 
Lots of kids and noise 
Anyways to finish off my review 
Food 8 out of 10 
Quality 8 out of 10
Service 7 out of 10 
Atmosphere 5 out of 10"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a couple of girlfriends.  It's delicious.  They serve bread at the start, with balsamic and olive oil.  Yum.  I had the caesar salad which was tasty and not overly garlicky.  I also ordered an anglotti stuffed with butternut squash.  It was to die for.  I will definitely be coming back.

Sorry for butchering the work Anglotti..."}
{"text":"Good Italian restaurant. Not fancy by any means but this is how Italian restaurant should be - homey and cozy. They offer reasonably priced menu and their portions is big. If you are on the Queensway area, this might be a good option for Italian."}
{"text":"Rocco's Plum Tomato is a yummy Italian spot I always love to experience and devour food at when I am down in the Annex.

Therefore, I DISAGREE with what the person who wrote the other review about Rocco before.

I find Rocco's menu to have a large selection of Italian favourites and I find that the prices are reasonable. The only time you may find the prices are higher is if you are ordering off of their seasonal specials menu.

A huge thing that has impressed me every time I have dined there is the service and the happiness just glowing off of all the staff members. Also, the staff know Rocco's food well and are always helpful in suggesting great eats for the guests.

As for my experience with their food - it has been great!

Here are some personal faves of mine:

- Shrimp and Scallop Penne, which is done up with spinach and mixed up in a great rose sauce ($16)

- Chicken Linguini, which is done up with red peppers, diced chicken and topped in a garlic cream sauce ($14)

- Stuff Chicken, filled with cheeses and veggies and served with a side caesar or mixed greens ($18)

- Gnocchi, chewy to perfection and flavoured up with their rose sauce and goat cheese ($14)


I admit that I am obsessed with the pastas here but I have tried bites of friend's pizzas and they were yummy too so I know those are great to order.

Overall, Rocco's Plum Tomato has a great selection, good prices and tons of character with its Italian's interior!"}
{"text":"Am an avid Yelp user and was referred by a friend for dinner. Had the best Veal Parmagian ever....met the bald Chef in the kitchen (his name is Rocco; the owner) one of the nicest person I have meet. No wonder this is one best kept secrets in Etobicoke for ovrr 30 years! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was so good. I had the gnocchi with Parmesan rose sauce and it was delicious not too filling for the portion that was really big. 
I will be going back there to try more of their delicious dishes. 
The atmosphere there was really cool and just like how Italy would look."}
{"text":"I'm rating their takeout sandwiches.
Loved the veal. Boyfriend had the chicken. We were both stuffed, and we have large appetites. For 6 and 7 dollars respectively, this is a hell of a lot of good food for the price. This place has destroyed the possibility of unsettling for Subway."}
{"text":"There was shit all open on boxing day, so after driving around and failing to locate a restaurant, we finally settled on Rocco's Plum Tomato. 

I've been to the other, horrible (now closed) location in the Annex so I had really low expectations for this place. 

The service was surprisingly good but the food did not impress. We had the grilled calamari appetizer, which was overcooked and pretty sure it came from frozen squid. The caprese salad was slightly better but pretty meh.

For a main, I had the grilled halibut. The fish was cooked perfectly, but the sauce (some kind of fruit reduction) was a seriously bizarre and the side risotto it came with wasn't especially delicious either.

Prices are alright, cute atmosphere, reasonable wine list but food is pretty 2.5 star. Good place for families as the menu has something for everyone, but wouldn't recommend for people in search of good food."}
{"text":"I came to this exact restaurant in early 2012 and it was very nice. It was an intimate and quiet restaurant. The service was first class and food portions were great. Three years later the portions have shrunk drastically, the quality of bread has diminished, and the atmosphere resembles your local family eatery with bright lights, no tablecloths, and paper napkins.  The service is average, but a definite drop off from where it was years ago. The fact that they have lots of customers with Groupons tells me they are struggling. We paid $57 plus tip for 3 average size grilled shrimp, four small pieces of grilled calamari, no more than 7-8 vegetables drowned in garnish, and a medium pizza which was average at best. We didn't even order drinks!  Sad, but we will not be back given the choice of Italian restaurants close by."}
{"text":"This place is usually top shelf; however today there was nothing but egg shells in our veal sandwiches
:( the whole family got at least one. Not a regular occurrence you should still try them"}
{"text":"I have been here twice, and I was quite happy both occasions.  The look of this restaurant is extremely unpretentious on the outside, but the interior decor is artsy and playful.  I wonder if someone related to the owner is/used to be an artist.  I ordered pasta both times, so I can attest that the pasta is authentic Italian.  The pasta is al dente; the sauce is rich and tasty.  I particularly love their tomato sauce the most, with the basil sauce a close second.  I think Rocco's make their sauces inhouse.  For the fresh pasta lovers, I think Rocco's use dry pasta, however.

They serve a good wine selection, nothing pricey, but decent dining wines.  The wine is priced reasonably by the glass.  (I have never ordered a whole bottle here).

Service is friendly, though I find they can use an additional staff.  There are complimentary bread and olives.

Rocco's opens on Sundays.  It is very, very popular in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Not very impressed.  We were there with some friends last night.  It was a weekday night and not busy, but the service was terrible.  No bread was brought and we had to beg for silverware.  In addition, he forgot to bring soup I ordered and after I changed my mind on the wine while placing the order, he brought my original choice.

The food that my partner and I had was passable, but mediocre.  I think there are better Italian choices than this one."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings mein friends, mixed feelings.

As in so many other cases, I have passed by Rocco's Plum Tomato dozens of times before actually trying it.  But on the plus side, that means I get out alot!  And I love the Annex.  Nothing like brunch on Sunday and then poking around BMV Books.

I was struck by the outside appearance of this restaurant and the fact that there are almost always people in the windows.  A good restaurant tends to have occupants.  If you pass by that anonymous \"Chinese Food\" restaurant with no one ever in it, there's probably a reason why.  There are beautiful painted wood carvings/signs outside Rocco's, and it has a friendly and fun feel to it.   I didn't realize it was an Italian restaurant until we were inside, but it was a nice surprise.

We actually sat on the patio, despite the fact that is was a prematurely chilly late-summer day.  Bundle up and tough it out Canadians!  Winter will be here before we know it, and you have to enjoy every precious second of patio weather.

I made the mistake of coming to the restaurant extremely hungry, and therefore everything on the menu sounded wonderful.  Too many things to try and only one stomach!  What a pity.

On the plus side, there was lots of pasta, pizzas, and Italian sandwiches to choose from.  I selected a chicken pizza, and my companion chose a sausage pizza.  I honestly would have rather shared, but we can never agree on toppings.  She thinks chicken on a pizza is the oddest combination ever.

On the down side, they had a limited selection of draft beers.  Heineken - $6.50, Keith's White and Pale Ale $5.50 and Coors Light $4.25.  I decided to get the import.  Not sure if it was worth it or not, but there's no way in hell I'm ordering Coors.

They brought us some fresh Italian bread sliced in a delightful fashion; thinly, almost like a pie.  As well as some olive oil with herbs, and balsamic vinegar to dunk it in.  I hadn't tried this before, but it was great!

About the time that our pizza arrived, so did the onslaught of wasps.  This is my Achilles heel of patio weather.  I love sitting outside, but I HATE stinging insects and my companion is allergic.  So we ended up jumping around the blissfully empty patio every minute or so when Mr. Stingy came to say hi.  Eventually we were able to swat it to death with a copy of Sports Illustrated.   \"Ahhh sweet relief.\" 

Then two more wasps came to avenge their fallen comrade!!  

Good lord.  This was the straw that broke the camel's back.  We moved inside to finish our pizzas.  This honestly ruined the experience.  The only consolation to us was that winter was approaching, and all the wasps would die.  Yay!

The food was very good, although I agree with the first reviewer in that it wasn't cheap.

I'm in no rush to go back.  But I suppose if I'm ever really confused, hungry and disoriented in the Annex, it's a good fallback."}
{"text":"Honestly, not a fan.  Went there once for dinner with my husband and it the décor was very distasteful.  It was like they were attempting to make it like a cozy, rustic environment but it was more like an old barn.  The tables are chairs were all unsteady and looked like they hadn't been cleaned properly.  Ordered the fried calamari - soggy.  Mushroom risotto - tons of dirt and sand from not washing/ rinsing the mushrooms properly.  Not cheap either."}
{"text":"I first visited Rocco's Plum Tomato on The Queensway about nine years ago. The food, atmosphere and service was exceptional. After that, we would go back a few times a year. However, as time went on, new restaurants opened in the neighbourhood and we started to frequent Rocco's less often. 

It was not until last week that I was asked to give a few suggestions for dinner for something kind of quaint and cozy. I immediately thought of Rocco's and we all decided to have dinner there. Everything was delicious, from the calamari to the seafood pasta (which I usually order). Normally it is difficult for me to eat a huge bowl of pasta but I finished every last bite. The tomato/white wine sauce was so subtle but yet it enhanced all the flavours of the fresh seafood. As always, the pasta was cooked to perfection.

Great service as usual and it was decorated so nice for Valentine's Day. 

I think I may need to make another trip back soon."}
{"text":"Usually come here with the family, it's nice but the menu could use an update... with more meat. Mind you that's not an Italian cuisine thing I guess... I would recommend their duck special, which is amazing. Good wine selection (of course, haha)."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant about 10 years ago. Loved it then, but something got lost in the years. The appetizers were great, unfortunately the main was lacking any flavor whatsoever. Part of me died tonight."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for over ten years and the food is consistently great. My favourite meal is the linguine with smoked chicken and sun dried tomatoes. It has been my favourite restaurant in Toronto for a long time and i am never disappointed."}
{"text":"Man oh man!  I used to eat here in my 20s!  

This place ain't no Olive Garden!  

Dinner after a show and it was great. Yes I am trying to put aside all of my reminiscing to focus on what actually happened during this experience. 

Casual decor that is comfortable and yet just a hint below upscale.  I wouldn't say you feel like you are at home, but pretty close. 

For our appetizer we had the grilled calamari which was very good and so much better without the breading. Not many places have this option since you have to be better at cooking it. 

I had a linguini supreme which comes with chicken and shrimp and plenty of them too.  A well balanced dish with sun dried tomatoes and a light olive oil based pesto sauce that was very good. My wife had the shrimp and scallops special which looked creamy and delicious. And while both portions were large, she took half home while I cleaned my plate. 

A house Pinot Grigio accompanied my pasta but I think next time I may choose another option for the pairing. 

For dessert there was their house tiramisu which disappeared before my eyes (sorry no pic). The poor soaked lady fingers stood no chance. 

This place is great for families, friends or even larger parties. And it won't break the bank."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and went to this great Italian spot.  Everything is extremely delicious, but don't go here if you're in a rush (which they warn you about).  Service is slow, but well worth the wait. A great neighbourhood spot and great for big groups."}
{"text":"I have heard of Rocco's Plum Tomatoes before but this was my first time here. First I though it was in such a remote spot that it would not be good. Again looks is deceiving, I love the ambiance of old world/traditional atmosphere. I know it's not for everyone but places like this suits my personality. Now let's move on to the food...my bf and I had the mussels and cesear salad to start. You can't go wrong with a salad, the mussels in a tomatoe broth was delicious. Following are the main course he had the chicken pizza and I had the shrimps and scallops risotto; again both were cook perfectly and delicious. We both had none alcohol beverages and sparkling water. Our bill with tax and tips came to around 100.00 which is standard and reasonable. I would definitely go back and would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the veal Marsala it was so small and the salad was dressed with pure vinegar. I asked for bread and the sandwich maker cut me a piece from a sandwich bun, after all I paid $20 for a tinny portion and I can't even get a whole bun??!!"}
{"text":"We were very unhappy with the service here, and that's something I very rarely say.

On a weekend after lunch, we came in and had to stand around and wait to be seated. Once we were seated, it took a long time for the waitress to take our orders. Or to bring water. Or to even bring the bread + olive oil.

Another group came in while we were waiting and asked us if we had waited long. Yes, we've been here for an hour and we've only placed our order so far! The chef/owner came out and promised the new group that their food would come out quickly and indeed, they got their bread before us, and their meal before we had even gotten our bread! All the while, the waitress/owner gave us no updates on our meal and didn't explain the situation until after she brought us our bill (which yes, I also had to ask for more than once).

The food was good. But spending almost two hours for lunch outside of lunch hours is unacceptable. Stick with the 'fast food' side of the restaurant and you'll get your food right away without having to pay tips on non-existent service."}
{"text":"Best kept secret!  The place is not in the prime location, can be easily missed and kinda outdated. BUT, the food here is delicious.  

Everything I've tried at Rocco's was good! The seafood pasta was great, Tiramisu is a 'must-have' and the BEST calamari I've had ever!"}
{"text":"This place has been a favorite of mine for many years. Great pasta! My personal favorite is Chicken Penne (on rose sauce)"}
{"text":"I have always found this restaurant very overrated. The food is passable. The wait staff was OK. The pizza was terrible and bland if u were lucky enough not to get a burnt one. 

I'd really rather have a slice of Pizza Pizza or pizza hut. Also,  if I can make a better spaghetti then a restaurant I usually don't go back."}
{"text":"Not a bad place.   The food was good and fresh, so no issues there.  The quality of the ingredients was great.  

The only complaint I have is that the menu is too basic.  I was hoping to have tortellini, or a dish with Alfredo sauce but there was none in the menu.   There also did not appear to be any dished with a meat sauce, just tomato. 

I ended up ordering the lasagna, although I would have liked meat in it, it was still good.  Tomato sauce, cheese, mushrooms, spinach, etc It was good.  Portion was huge and I actually took half if it home as I was stuffed.  

I have not been to the other locations and perhaps the menu has more on it, but this location was good.  May try the other locations at some point. 

I read one review that said the tomato sauce tasted like it was from a can.  Not sure how that happened but the sauce tasted fresh and home made.  I make my own sauce at home and I found that this place used only fresh home made sauce."}
{"text":"It's been a long, long time since we ate at Rocco's and based on our most recent experience, I'm reminded why we've stayed away for so long.

Came in for an early dinner on a quiet weeknight.  Ordered:  fried calamari appetizer ($11.95), shrimp risotto ($18.95) and a pepperoni pizza ($15.95), not on the menu but made for us as we had our little one that couldn't eat the spicier pepperonata pizza.  We also ordered beers (Sleeman) and a milk.

Service itself was slow and non-existent.  No water refills, no checking in.  I'd hate to see what the service would be like when this place is full.

Food came out steaming hot.  We had to really dig apart the risotto to cool it down.  The calamari and risotto portions were pretty big.  But quantity doesn't really mean quality here.  The calamari rings were small and thin, most likely from a frozen bag. 

We use to come to Rocco's back in the day when Toronto wasn't brimming with choices for innovative Italian fare.  Times have changed and so have our expectations.  While waiting for our bill, I steadily made a list of all the other places we'll be going to instead."}
{"text":"I first went here over 10 years ago. Food was good and decor nice, it was busy and service was good:) 10 years later food decent, service poor and decor tired.
I had to get up and get my waiter!!!!
However, they did a groupon type deal and I thought, well, the food is good and it was a good deal so I'll give them another chance.
It was a mistake!! They have decided NOT to honour the coupon!!!!!! Too bad for their customers!!!! They make a decision to offer and deal and refuse to honour it because, \"we don't make any money on those!\"!!!!! 
Maybe do the costing prior to offering a deal next time!!!!!!!
Wow!! 
My dollars will be helping a business who values customers and has better business practices!!"}
{"text":"Just went for dinner with friends for the first time.  Extremely great. I usually don't review restaurants as I eat like a 5 year old and just as picky.  Rocco's has an amazing selection including the largest vegetarian selection.  I settled on the gnocchi which was so delicious and be sure to finish off with the amazing tiramisu.  Great space and wonderful service. Without a doubt a no brainer to return"}
{"text":"Nice! Good food; nice service; intimate atmosphere.
I would return and do recommend to eat here."}
{"text":"Wow.. my good friend brought me here (he's Italian) of course ans even knew the owner. The owner was very nice, greeted my friend and me and asked if we were okay with drinks and food, he even chatted with us for a bit. Very nice man. The food is sooooo goood!! I got the butternut squash ravioli with a rose cream sauce and pesto sauce as a garnish on top (I personally dislike pesto sauce but I have to admit, it was delicious as a garnish). The bread with olive oil and vinegar was amazing! I love olives and it came with olives on the side! I had a peroni beer and the other Italian brand beer.. I forgot the name of it, but it was good. My friend had the stuffed chicken in some sauce and I tried a bite of his and I instantly wanted to claim his food! We wanted some scallop dish but it was only seasonal and the waitress told us they didn't have it anymore but it wasn't a big deal because the food made up for it. I also had the calabrese salad, me and my friend shared it and everything in general was delicious. Definitely will be back and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Probably the worst service ever.  Our waiter a man with a shaved head seemed like we were inconveniencing him.  He never came around and once I managed to see him and tag him down to order a drink.  He brought over the drink and I was in the middle of ordering another drink for my friend and he walked away in mid sentence before I could finish and never brought it.  The place was completely empty by the way other than one table so its not like he was busy.  Then my friends dinner came with a selection of a few desserts and instead of giving her a choice he just slammed one down on the table.  He never once asked how our meals were because he probably knows the food sucks."}
{"text":"There was a bug in the bread basket and when we told the server all he said was he must have been hungry too and laughed.  They didn't offer any compensation."}
{"text":"Has this restaurant changed owners? I went in a month ago and had a terrific meal. went back this time and the fish was low quality and the service was poor."}
{"text":"Delicious. The grilled calamari was tasty and tender. I highly recommend the penne with shrimp and scallops, Delicious rose sauce with spinach and goat chess makes it a perfect blend of flavors The blond had the Farfalle with shrimp in a garlic cream sauce, very tasty. The service is fast and friendly and the food was served hot. 
I love this place."}
