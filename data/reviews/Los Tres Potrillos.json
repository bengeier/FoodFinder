{"text":"The cooks from La Tapatia got their own place! Same good food as before, just in a cleaner better lit location. They even have their tortilla machine in full view so you can watch them get made. The salsa bar is also a nice edition with plenty of variety and even grilled jalapeños. Don't see why you wouldn't go here if you liked the old place."}
{"text":"WOW! I asked a family member where to get a great and yet affordable lunch was in a quick minute.  He told me Los Tres Portillos is my go to spot.  They have amazing food.  Well upon his referral i took my two boys and we stopped by.  We all had tacos and a plate of churros.  Simply amazing and fresh.  4 churros, 11 tacos, 3 sodas came to a total of $21.  Amazing we all left happy and made the movie on time.  Definitely a go to spot."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing authentic mexican cuisine! Homemade tortillas & fresh ingredients, need I say more?!"}
{"text":"You cannot find better tacos in the valley. I know. I've tried them all!  It's fantastic to find legit Mexican food this far from the southwest. And they've got their tortilla machine out where you can watch! Low key friendly environment. Great for low key lunch or family Meals"}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos you can get for a $1.  And they have competition near by too.  Definitely not a let down; chicken is super juicy and big."}
{"text":"I'm a little hesitant to write an exceptional review because I don't want the secret to get out.  Don't tell anybody...but the food here is REALLY good!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!!!!  Rockin' tacos!   This place is the first great Mexican Food Taqueria that I have had, since I moved here from Cali."}
{"text":"This is the best mexican restaurant we have been to in this area, we are so glad we didn't give up and found you!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant. My son and I come here regularly. The service is quick and friendly. We prefer this place over la tapatia any day (no meat market on display and no long lines/waiting, and their salsa is bomb). Loveeeeee this place!"}
{"text":"A taste of Mexico right at the heart of the city of Phoenix. I grew up eating authentic Mexican food  and this is by far the most authentic Mexican food in the Rogue Valley. They have a wide selection of different meats. They have dollar tacos Monday-Friday. I am impressed by their customer service, very friendly, family ran business. The place is very spacious for big parties if needed. Would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for true authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food, great service, great price. Eat here!!!  You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Had the tacos and I will be back. So far, the best taco's in the valley and so affordable. Friendly counter person too. It will be my new lunch spot."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed every Mexican food place this has been. The food here is okay... It has changed the most since the original Soco's Restaurant and while it is completely fine and edible I miss the friendliness of previous places.  I work not to far away and went and called in a vegetarian burrito for pick up. I was SO hungry. I get my burrito (I always tip like I am eating there btw) and go back to work.  I take my first bite and immediately bite into a large piece of steak. I think \"shoot\" they gave me the wrong burrito. Not the end of the world but kind of a pain. I am super hungry still so I jump back in my car and take the burrito back. When I return the burrito, the girl at the counter relays the mix up to the owner (in Spanish) the owner proceeds to tell my I am wrong and rather rudely rips the burrito from my hands and shows me there is not meat inside. I realize what happened wasn't the fact the burrito was WRONG just that it had gotten a piece or two of steak in it that shouldn't have been there. I try to explain and show him the side of the burrito with the steak in it but he refuses to allow me too. He just kinda huffs off and I did get another burrito but I was left feeling embarrassed and confused.   I am polite to a fault and was super kind to everyone involved when I first ordered AND when I went back because of the steak. If I had opened the burrito and realized the rest of it didn't have meat I probably would have just eaten it but because I was so hungry and thought I got the wrong thing and didn't want to waste time I just jumped up and went back. I have been back once since and the owners energy is just all around negative. I got plenty of other places I can go near by and so do your other customers so being NICE might be worth it."}
{"text":"We've eaten here I half a dozen times and tried a variety of menu items. All we're good, somewhere great!"}
{"text":"Turns out the Tres Potrillos (the the young colts) are cooks from the Mexican food place across the street. I used to be a big fan of the place across the street but noticed a decline in many areas. Now I know why.  Los Tres Potrillos is clean, organized, great service, and most importantly - I mean come on, it's all about the food - the food is very authentic and the best Mexican food place in the area."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast this morning, the pineapple agua Fresca wasss to die for. The beans and rice were also super great. I ordered a breakfast burrito and he ordered chilequiles. I thought the breakfast burrito could use a little less salt, or have something in it to cut that super salty flavor, but it still tasted good (I love burritos.) His chilequiles however were better than la tapatia and I wish I would have ordered those instead because they were pretty amazing. I'll be back to try their lunch stuff and I'm glad we found a New Mexican food place. As you can see mexican food is my fave!"}
{"text":"First visit today after long-term affection for La Tapatia down the street. Limp chips, flaccid and skinny chile relleno, oddly-flavored tacos al pastor (what WAS that taste?). Their salsa bar wins acclaim on Google but the teeny ramekins provided are awkward. We are delighted to see they are doing good business but will remain fans of \"The Other Guys.\" Finally, I've worked in Mexico for 47 years. What is done to that cuisine in the US of A is a rotten, dirty, shame!  What would happen if Mexican eateries abandoned gloppy tomato sauce and cheese plastered over beans and rice and actually went for FRESH and tasty food? The same has happened to so-called \"Chinese\" food - the yokels stagger in because it is CHEAP but it bear scant resemblance to the real thing.  BTW ..... I can do without Yelp asking me if I spotted a \"Gender Neutral\" bathroom where I ate. Sheesh!"}
{"text":"So good!  Came out to Ashland to to visit my brother and he brought us here.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"We've decided we actually like this place even better than their more famous neighbors across the street... the food tastes more fresh and even though the interior is a little run down, we like the dining room more.  People are nice and the food is some of the best authentic mexican we've had anywhere!"}
{"text":"This place used to be Genos. I came here craving legit tacos and what I got was second to none in terms of tacos that I have had in the Rogue Valley.   Resteraunt looks the same as previous the owners except for the tortilla machine that's visible in the kitchen. They make their tortillas in house, how awesome.   I order two asada, two de pollo, and a birria taco.   They garnish the tacos with a pinch of cilantro and diced onions. The asada was tender and flavorful. The pollo was seasoned adaobada style and was also juicy and tender. The birria was super tender and was soaked in its own flavorful consommé. Overall the protein was super tender and flavorful.   Thier is a taco garnish bar with picked vegetables, radishes, limes, salsas, and Pico de gallo.   Great food and affordable prices , I would come here daily if I lived in pheonix"}
{"text":"If you're looking for some great real Mexican food don't miss out on this they got the best Carnitas in the valley .You can't beat  the dollar tocos great prices around thanks guys always a pleasure to eat there."}
{"text":"I am a longtime fan of the taco spot across the street, so when I heard that a couple of the cooks had moved across the street I had to give it a try.  Months later, I finally got around to it, and was not disappointed.  After trying 5 different tacos, I will say that the Birria and Chorizo were the best of the bunch.  That said, there were several other choices on the menu that I did not try purely due to fullness of the stomach.  I will certainly be going back to branch off from the Tacos to test some menu items out.  Not to be missed is their salsa bar, some great sauces there to amp up the flavors.  Don't expect super warm service, or the nicest interior decor, but come on that isnt why you would go to a taco spot anyway.  If you are looking for fancier tacos and nice spot, head to Ashland, there are at least three places you can pay twice as much for less authentic food."}
