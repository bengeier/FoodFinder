{"text":"I've come to this place a few times to pick up items from their desserts section, in particular their honey fingers which are pieces of honey-drenched goodness in a moist cake form. I've recently gotten around to ordering something from their menu and loved the way they built the chicken shawarma I ordered. Not only were the vegetables all fresh and crisp (loved the pickled stuff!), but before serving, they grill-press the shawarma leaving the outer pita hot and nicely crisp. Fantastic sauce and definitely one of the most flavourful chicken shawarmas I've enjoyed in the city. I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu! The staff of the place are super friendly, often offering free samples along with their smiles!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. They have the best shawarmas in Calgary hands down. I havent had any where the cheese sauce actually works. Usually its hard to get cheese in shawarma and it tastes good but this place did it. Also the owner is really nice and polite. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"My bf and I stop by here quite often for the chicken shawarma platter. Awesome food,
great staff and prices. The homemade desserts are some of the best I've ever had. 

Although I have never tried the donairs I highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here today to try a donairs.  I do not care for donairs that sit in a heat tray it makes it taste gross. Any way everything was taken out of a heat tray. Skimpy portions and very very tasteless.  On the search for the perfect t donairs.  Will not be going back!"}
