{"text":"This greasy spoon hits the spot.  Although a bit intimidating from the street due to some of the sketchy people hovering around, its staff is super nice and even the cook says hello. The food was good,  particularly the pancakes. Bring your own real maple syrup as the fake stuff they serve does not belong on those delicious pancakes."}
{"text":"gross food served in a dirty place. Lots of sketchy people. Service was not great either. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"I typically really like greasy spoons. The type with personality - this isn't one of them. The restaurant was empty and our waitress could be seen in only the background and didn't come around to see if we needed anything after she brought our food. We had to go to the waiting station several times to collect what we needed. This didn't seem to be an issue with the staff. The food was unbearably salty. Looks like some newer restaurants have popped and this place was trying to cash in. This place has been around for a long time and it appeared to have recently been updated with a fresh coat of paint and the seats were reupholstered. To sum up - it was expensive for what we got.... or didn't get. We rolled the dice and lost."}
{"text":"Greasy spoon where the regulars and alcoholics hang out at the front, and the locals and Lakeshore-ites eat in the dining room at the back.

Pretty good greasy-spoon fare, good breakfast. The service can be lacking, however."}
{"text":"Good breakfast place to go fast and a good greasy spoon. Friendly service comforting atmosphere. Try the hashbrowns and back bacon"}
{"text":"went here and tried the chopped steak and was grossed out. The burger was burned and the place was weird with welfare people. thanks but no Thanks!"}
{"text":"Food is very good.  A basic fare with good portions.  Service is fast and friendly.  Great breakfast and the steak is very good."}
{"text":"DECENT...
Nice Staff, sketchy area..
Multiple HAIRS in my take out container/food last time; MAJOR TURNOFF"}
{"text":"The Dice is our go to place for some quick good food. The menu is pretty standard fare for a diner but my partner swears on the handmade burger. It is really very good. 
An interesting cast of characters hang out there but it makes for some good people watching. Always consistent and good food. Nothing fancy but reliable and tasty. You can even have a beer with your grilled cheese!! The staff are extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Fairly typical greasy spoon.  Good but not great food, servers are friendly place seemed a little dingy.."}
{"text":"Tried this neighbourhood greasy spoon last Sunday and absolutely loved it.  It is a total dive, but that is what makes it great.  Hashbrowns made in house, delicious breakfast sausages, and to-die-for pancakes makes this place a must for any breakfast lover.  Two people can easily eat breakfast and have coffee/juice/soda for around $16-19.  Portions are huge, so if you want to try a couple of different things, be prepared to share with the rest of your table.  Definitely going to go back tomorrow."}
{"text":"This is truly awesome for what it's meant to be. It's the same kinda diner a lot of people grew up with, and has been forever (versus the places trying to look that way all nostalgic like... Which is also great sometimes). 

Awesome hash browns, big portions, simple old school menu, pretty impressive looking back bacon, and truly lovely staff. Family run vibe for sure. 

We'll be back a ton, to try and achieve 'regular' status - felt like a ton of people knew one and other in there. And no idea where people are getting the whole \"sketchy area\" thing; this neighbourhood is like any other in Toronto with everything from apartments to million dollar houses, but a super friendly atmosphere. Maybe if you're from Baby Point or Rosedale, this isn't really your scene :)"}
