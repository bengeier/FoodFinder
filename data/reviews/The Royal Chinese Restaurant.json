{"text":"?????

Beef chow fun, ????"}
{"text":"clams w/black bean sauce was quite delicious. My wife's salt n pepper squid was just ok (I tried to talk her into something else but happy wife, happy life).

I'd for sure go back and try some other seafood dishes. I'd also ask the waitstaff to translate the numerous specials written in Chinese on the walls as sometimes I've found that these specials are not listed on the menu in English.

Open unitl late (1:30AM)"}
{"text":"Not fully authentic, but the restaurant offers a great array of Chinese dishes. It is usually packed full with customers and you may have to wait in line. The waiters are friendly but in peak hours they may be in a rush. Don't let that bother you, because they are very friendly even when they are very busy and the food is really great."}
{"text":"It is a non sense good food but no frills restaurant 
So if you like to have nice ambience , tiny portion of food with the chef fussing over the look with high prices e.g. Centre, canoe , please don't come here 
What you get is FRESH seafood, pipping hot (in Chinese, we call it Wok Air) food and friendly service and a very reasonable price. 
We got there at 515 and it was already 35 percent full of patrons. 
We ordered a fresh steam tilapia with ginger and onion, braised pork eith sea moss and snow pea shoot, spicy clams.  The fish was very good. Some Chinese restaurant give you the fish but it was already dead. The freshness of the fish is equivalent to the ones from the floating seafood restaurant in hong Hong. 
The snow pea dish was tasty and the braised pork is comparison with the fancy places downtown. 

The service was friendly but not overly attentive, once you request the service, they do respond quickly, so all in all, for  50 dinner, it was very good

I have been to high end Chinese restaurant like Casa Imperisl and they serve the same food with more waiters and fancier surroundings 

Some real foodies, it is for you but it will help if you bring a Chinese friend because some specials are written on the traditions paper strips , and they are hung on the wall. 

Oh.. The place is quite clean and the washroom was quite acceptable"}
{"text":"Wow! this is great and very authentic.  This place was packed and full of Asians eating here :)   A sign of authentic Chinese food.
We found this place by accident loveddddddddd this restaurant. It is so economical and soooo good.   I did not do any research on YELP but found this place due to the large crowds waiting for seats on Sheppard Ave.
We were a large group of 10 and ordered:
chili fried shrimp,chili pork, chilifried clams, fried green beans, lobsters, steamed fish, fried tofu, sauteed seafood and chinese broccoli, and mushroom and bok choy.

BTW - The restaurant gives out complimentatry soup & taro red beans dessert.

Love this place."}
{"text":"Overrated.  It is a no frill restaurant. Food was nothing special.  Yes, the dishes looks fully fill.  Service was poor.  The server reminders me that I under tip him.  I didn't realize there was a law in Canada that I have to fully tip the server for poor service. There is No law in Canada that I have to leave tip.  It is just a culture thing."}
{"text":"Good eats overall. Value is really good. went with family and we had a variety of food. tofu eggplant, clams, fish, cold chicken, pork, soup. 

Overall this place was alright in the middle range of quality.  in the clams you have to watch out for little crabs in the dish (see photo) which is kind of gross.

nonetheless go here if u want cheap decent chinese food."}
{"text":"Good food, good service and good prices.

I usually try to go before peak dining times as it does get busy."}
{"text":"Definitely a go-to restaurant with my family. Seafood for cheap? Why not!

I come here on an almost weekly basis and ordered tons of dishes in the past. Their steamed chicken, steamed shrimps, and the big crab steamed rice are my favourite. I would stray away from any other type of fried rice as it tends to be flavourless and oily. Some dishes like the mushroom and beef dish are way too salty sometimes. The complimentary soup and dessert (and oranges) are always a plus. If you ask nicely, they'll refill the soup for you.

The service here is great and the waiters are very nice but sometimes the food can take a long time. Also it's a Chinese restaurant so expect your dishes to come as they are ready.

If you're looking for affordable, authentic and clean Chinese seafood restaurant, this is your place."}
{"text":"I've never had a waiter scream at us for their own screw ups.  We came in waited for our seats, some customers waited in line before us, the waiter led us to sit down right away the people waited for their seats for half an hour before us got upset (they have the right to be upset).  The waiter, instead of owning up to their mistake, scream at our family.  This is unacceptable behavior.  I would have accepted an apology and a simple correction.  We ate there many years, but after this incident, we are never coming back.  And I'll make sure none of my friends and family ever eat there.  If you like being treated like crap for mediocre food this is your restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is great, best crab and lobster around, I like the services best of all. They are great to the little ones too. They always get candy at the end of their meals which the little ones look forward to. There's not that many authentic Chinese restaurants that provides good services."}
{"text":"We used to go to The Royal quite frequently when they were still on their old location.  But since they moved to the bigger location, we didn't go in until tonight.  The place was barely 1/3 full on a Friday night (not a good sign).

We ordered sweet n sour ribs (meat was tough as leather), string beans w/ shredded meat, hollow veggie stir fried (a soupy overcooked mess), clams lightly cooked w/ ginger (completely flavourless), breaded shrimp (turned out looking like a western chinese dish and tasted just as bad), and a crunchy egg noodle for my kids (sauce was like glue). The only saving grace of the night was the free dessert.

Overall a terrible meal. Don't know how this place can survive serving food like this."}
{"text":"Terrible service, very small portions relative to price (and to other Chinese restaurants). However, I must admit that the food was delicious and came extremely quickly even on a busy night. The dishes were quite greasy though, and some of the seafood can be a hit or miss depending on the chef."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in a small plaza and apparently, I have driven by here several times. How do people find these places?!? It's a small restaurant, and NOT FANCY! Cutlery can be bordering dirty (our family saw three dirty tea cups). I haven't tried the bathroom, but one can probably imagine the state that it is in, especially after a busy night.

Service, at the start, was absolutely horrible. My parents and I arrived first (we had a family of 14), and we didn't know if my uncle had made reservations. My mom asked if there were reservations made under the name of Kua, and the man said no. No problem...we would need a table for 14 anyways, so we asked for one. The man again said no, and for my mom to call my uncle to make sure if there were reservations or not. So, if there were no reservations, than we wouldn't get the table? *rant*

Food was greasy and uninspiring, in my opinion. Service - mediocre. But, again, I guess this is okay for many people because?!?! By 6:30 the place was packed and the line extended outside the restaurant!

The only good thing I remembered about this place were there juicy oranges which they served for dessert. Everyone loved them so much we actually asked the waiters where they got their oranges!! No need to come for their food!

In the end, the food was not that great, but it was actually quite expensive! My dad footed the bill for 14 people and it came to around $300 and change! For cheap, greasy, seafood. Ugh.

Not impressed and not going back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"I have been here at least 5 years ago and I came back last night (Monday). It is still the same, restaurant is busy and not taking reservations. 

Traditional HK style ordering and dishes. Most of their dishes were $7.95 for most common home made like dishes. Seafood is more expensive like the stir fried clams were $12.95. 

We had the preserved black bean sauce stir fried with clams, for $12.95 I think I can get a bit more clams however their clams were pretty big in size and the meat texture is very fresh. No smelly dead unopen clams. 

The sweet and sour pork chop was typical. Not a lot of onion to my surprising and the pork chop was still juicy, not dry after deep fried. The sauce was a bit more on the sweeter side. 

Chicken fried rice- plain, simple, I'm not even sure if it was on the menu because I tend to have a bad habit of ordering on top of my mind with what I'd like to eat. I guess it's soya sauce based, a lot of chicken chopped up, peas and the rice texture is amazing! I like the rice to be dried and individual, some like their rice wet and sticky though. Personal opinions. 

Bitter melon with beef in preserved black bean sauce- the typical flavor. Nothing much special to write. 

Fillet with tofu, and tofu skin in a pot- a lot of fillet (frozen ones). I find this dish a bit blend in flavoring but it's good because we often eat too much condiments in everyday life."}
{"text":"This place has REALLY high quality ingredients.  from the fish to the chicken to the shrimp.  everything is cooked in a healthy way. prices are very fair.  waiters are VERY nice and welcoming.    

I come here every 2 weeks I love it very much."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for a table of ten and the table was ready upon arrival.  The restaurant was quite busy for a Monday night!  

Our servers were quite accommodating, friendly, informative, and even made some jokes while taking our order.  We had maybe 3 different servers throughout our meal. They were all great!  

We ordered several dishes: steamed fish, steamed crab with lotus leaf rice, stir fried prawns, pepper/salt fried pork, pea shoots, gai lan junior, pickled veggies with pork belly, salted fish with tofu, and half a chicken.  

All the dishes were brought out in a timely manner.  Portions were good, even when shared amongst ten adults. The final bill, including tax and tip, was just under $250. That was an extremely satisfying meal for such a reasonable price! They even gave a complimentary starter soup and sweet soup for dessert.  

For a homestyle Cantonese dinner, I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites in the city.  Order anything you can recognize and it will be good.  Beware service is often spotty at best but the food is good and thats the reason to go."}
{"text":"This is the best place if you want to have food after 10pm. They are open till 3 am  and moreover they serve alcohol.  The hospitality is amazing, the food is one of the best in the area. The restaurant is huge and has a plenty of space. Recommended"}
{"text":"This long stretch of Sheppard Avenue East is lined with rundown strip plazas with many vacancies.  This particular plaza located on the southwest corner of Sheppard Avenue East and Birchmont had recently gone through a revitalization in the sense that large swaths of it has been rebuilt.  It is now anchored by a large-ish, new and shiny Rexall pharmacy.  The space where The Royal Chinese Restaurant now resides used to be the original location of Chinese Halal Restaurant now relocated north to Silver Star Blvd http://www.yelp.ca/biz/chinese-halal-restaurant-scarborough#hrid:XOYT8tagcp4WHJ5uOr69UQ as a renewal of their lease would have been much more costly.  The Royal Chinese Restaurant itself used to be located further east on Sheppard next to the Agincourt GO station, however, I think that plaza had been expropriated by or sold to Transit City.  That plaza is now a mess of construction and fencing.  

This place is a popular Chinese eatery with inexpensive menu items.  We arrived for dinner at 7 to a happening scene with crowds milling around the door waiting for seats.  Many dishes start at $6.95 each.  We had the braised eggplant with bean curd (delicious!), black pepper beef on a sizzling plate (impressive sizzle!-ing sounds but a very very weird, soft and chewy texture), various veggie dishes (one with white fish fillets, yum!), e-fu noodle and a whole crab fried rice (visually exciting and tasty to boot).  Dinner came with free soup and orange slices for dessert.  Service was efficient and could be friendly depending on the server you get.

To be honest, I've had much better Chinese food elsewhere, but for some decent, authentic eating at a reasonable price, The Royal Chinese Restaurant is definitely a good option.

Lots of free parking!"}
{"text":"This place has saved me so many times! Have had many early morning dinners here. Love that it's open so late! What can I say lol I always leave feeling like they dislike us but my goodness is it delicious! This place has some great food! YEAH! Great Job!"}
{"text":"Very Good Chinese Restaurant. The staff there are very friendly. The would spend time to talk to customers. Food is excellent. Ingredient is always fresh. Deep Fried Spicy Pork Chop was so crispy. Seafood Noodle and Eggplant are our favorite."}
{"text":"My parents and my brother are here before I was even born, became pretty regular that we would eat here. All the staff are extremely nice, they joke around with their customers and make them feel at home. The food here is extremely cheap and affordable but it tastes extremely great. Dishes I recommend are Pork chops in orange sauce, xo sauce beef and their chilli chicken. You can also ask them to put more sauce, less salt etc. A really cute thing is they will hand out lollipops to children after they finished eating."}
{"text":"...very pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness of this place. the renovation of the whole plaza probably had much to do with it though. the live seafood tanks were quite crystal clear, which to be honest is slightly unusual to see at these types of Chinese restaurants. 

we ordered:
chicken and corn soup, good. 
beef with mixed vegetables, good. 
spicy salted squid, good. 
yang chau fried rice, mediocre.  

all the portions were large, price very reasonable, i'd definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Wait time takes about 45 mins and this was for 3 dishes plus 2 rices. We ordered the Spare ribs with black bean sauce (6/10), the chow mein (5/10) and the curry chicken (3.5/10), and that took 45 mins wait time at around 1:30PM. If it is \"busy hour\" and they were slow with the staffs, informing us when we were at the front waiting to be seated, would've been appreciated - it was never mentioned to us.

When the spare ribs came out and we weren't sure it was ours, we asked if this was the item we ordered and the man who took the order got PISSED! He must've been hungry or something, but I really don't understand how \"is this the xxx dish?\" can get someone that mad. From his reaction, I bet the tables close-by thought I had called his mom a name!

Overall, thumbs down. WAY WAY DOWN!"}
{"text":"Great value. The spicy clams with minced pork is awesome. Their free soup even had ginseng! Suggest that reservations be made as there is a wait on weekends."}
{"text":"Even though I was with a bunch of Asians, because we were chatting in English, we got the Western treatment!!

They didn't give us the lai tong (comp soup), weren't the friendliest and the service took forever.

We switched it up and only talked to the staff in english, but then would talk to each other in Chinese.

Food itself was acceptable, but ain't going back."}
{"text":"You guys - forget that fisherman lobster clubhouse. This place serves the big lobster, with better wok hay (wok air) - but without the fancy price tag. Get me: it's still not cheap for the big lobster, but it's way more affordable. Usually a giant lobster will run around 105-120. 
There, I said it.

My go to is a giant lobster with spicy pork, and steam egg with the lobster guts. It is divine! I can eat bowls after bowls of rice with it. 

Aside from that, your cantonese favourites are all amazing here. Eggplant pork bowl, pork belly with preserved cabbage, you name it. 

The secret is out: but not really, a lot of local Chinese family go there doted with some Westerners dining there so arrive early - 6pm the latest. You can reserve a table if you have 8+ people I believe. 

It's only not 5 star because I am aware the service isn't the best unless you're a friendly regular. But guys, you are coming for the food anyways, and trust me, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Went here with the family for a birthday dinner.  Total was about $75 for twin lobster, fried rice with shrimp cooked in a bamboo steamer, bok choy with preserved egg, bean curd, tofu and fish in hot pot, beef short ribs in honey and sweet and sour pork. 

Food came out fast and furious and our waiter was really nice, especially to my five year old niece.  Was constantly keeping her entertained and gave her a lollipop too.  

As for the food, fried rice with shrimp was huge and amazing and was around $15, but the portion was absolutely huge. Could serve 8-9.  The lobster was not bad, but not amazing.

The rest of the dishes were okay to amazing, but great value at only $6.95/plate.  My favourite was the sweet and sour pork as it was very taste and crispy.  The hot pot was not bad,but the short ribs and bok choy were not the best.  

I'd visit again, but not for anything special, just for a normal dinner."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the drive to Scarborough for terrific Cantonese food. It's hard to find better than this downtown"}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times throughout the years. Each visit was a delight in terms of food, pricing, and service. They have many specials everyday and stays open till past midnight.

A tasty and cheaper than average chinese restaurant. Many different dishes and lots of seafood options. Their porkchop is good and the complimentary soup and dessert is always appreciated.

Constantly busy with a good crowd of regulars. Staff, especially the uncle looking server, who works there daily are all super friendly."}
{"text":"This place is my all time favourite Chinese food place. The seafood is so fresh and prepared do well. You can see the tanks that they keep there seafood in and see these they take good care of there stuff. I've been here multiple times and have tried multiple things but I think the best dishes they have is the house style crab and the house style oysters. Both of them are spicy and fried and oh so delicious."}
{"text":"The food is so so, nothing special to write about. The worst thing is the crowded, noisy condition. 
The hostess always tries to push the guests out, to have faster turn over on the limited number of tables. 
The washrooms are dirty, located in the basement, they got that musky smell."}
{"text":"Been there many times on weekdays and some Saturdays.  Service is attentive and fast.  Food is flavourful, good selection of dishes on the menu, price is really reasonable and it comes out pretty fast.  Décor is very simple but the seating is comfortable.  Sufficient parking spaces, easy to find.  I could come here every week for dinner."}
{"text":"Twice I polished off the complimentary Soup, mostly on-my-own. (+0.5)
Twice I love reading those dishes(chinese) labeled on NEON papers.
Twice I ate Black Bean Clam dish(typhoon shelter-style)($11.95).
Twice the Waiters came chit-chat casual-more-than-fine atmosphere.

Once I didn't like XO Fried Fish Fillet ($9.95) until I nuked it at home.
Once I had the Ying Yang Rice, not my style not my food type.
Once I had Mushroom with Vegetables ($6.95), healthy 'shroom portion.

Everytime I see people order Seafood especially Lobsters/Crabs.
Everytime I am reminded of old Magic Wok/old Royal from decor/mood.

Feels old school, feels like good old times, feels like a good meal out."}
{"text":"Not as good this time around. Their specialty lobster (the fried one with bits of fried pork and chili peppers) was a tad too brown, and not fragrant enough. Their deep fried oysters were delicious, though. The oysters were really big and really juicy. The batter was very crispy, but a tad thick. Some of their dishes were a tad small (we ordered a set meal). 

My second biggest gripe of the night was that we ordered a steamed fried rice with shrimp in lotus leaf and it wasn't steamed enough. It tasted like a fried rice they put into lotus leaves and then placed in a steamer. There was no lotus flavor at all, and the rice was too dry to have been steamed for very long. Considering that steaming rice in lotus costs extra, I feel ripped off. I don't like feeling ripped off.

My biggest gripe of the night was that it was my grandmother's birthday, and our main server kept sucking up to us. It seemed like he was trying to get the traditional red pocket money that older Chinese generations might give out on their birthday."}
{"text":"This is a go-to Chinese restaurant for our family and we drive from Whitby to get here.  The service is great with steamy dishes that always taste great.  Their hot plates, rice noodles and lobster are very delicious. The wait tends to be long around 6-7 so go after 8-ish.  The only unfortunate part is that they tend to provide better service to loyal customers and those that order more expensive items on the menu. Nevertheless, highly recommended for belly filling Chinese food ;)"}
{"text":"I have been going to place for many years with my family and it's great! The food they serve is very delicious authentic Chinese! This is a great restaurant to go to with family for dinner. However, this place is very busy during dinner hours and the wait can be long sometimes!"}
{"text":"Very busy, expect a long wait if you didn't make a reservation during peak hours.
Solid food, extensive menu, market prices for steamed fish and lobsters.
My only complaint would be their service. The server never cleaned our individual plates, so we ended up piling up empty shells and bones on plate that was underneath the soup bowl... took us a long time to even get attention from anyone to ask for more napkins and containers to pack leftovers to go. We witnessed one waiteress (old lady) yelling at customers who were in the line. The reason was two group tried to share the table and apparently you are not supposed to share a table here. 

Overall, decent food, reasonable price, but terrible service."}
{"text":"This restaurant was surprisingly busy, with a constant line up at the door on a Friday night.

When we arrived, it took a while for a server to approach us to give us a number while we waited. 

This Chinese restaurant is the kind with minimum decor (or I guess no decor?) and with menu items posted over the walls in Chinese on colorful paper. The majority of the menu here is in Chinese, so bring a Chinese reading friend if you do plan on dining here! (There was one menu that had English with pictures and the other menu was all Chinese). 

We ordered 5 dishes for our group of 4: 

(1) The shrimp dish we got arrived first. It came nice and hot but the shrimp itself lacked a bit of flavor and I thought the shrimp didn't seem all that fresh. 

(2)The beef dish we got was just stir fried beef that they bought out in a bowl and then plated on a sizzling hot plate for us at the table. I thought this dish was flavourful but nothing special. (One person at my table did think this dish was too dry but I didn't think so.)

(3) The sauce for the sweet and sour pork was fine but I wasn't a huge fan of the meat itself. The meat was too fatty and soft. 

(4, 5) Veggie dishes- The veggies seemed fresh but were a bit oily for our liking. 

The dessert they gave us was this taro tapioca dessert. (yay for chinese restaurants that give you actual desserts instead of just orange slices). I actually didn't have any of this but I think people thought the dessert was just okay. 

One problem with this place is that the bowls and utensils weren't that clean. 

Overall the food wasn't that good. Maybe we ordered the wrong things? (The recent reviews of this place are quite positive). I don't plan on coming back here."}
{"text":"Went here Sunday night. The line up for this place is ridiculous. At least an hour wait during dinner time. The wait after ordering was also crazy at least 40 mins. When I asked the server he just told me to wait more! Couldn't even be bothered to check that our order was placed or what was happening in the kitchen. 

The only saving grace for this place is that the prices are quite affordable. The food tastes fine but is extremely greasy and full of MSG. There are lots of other better options in the area in my opinion."}
{"text":"The beef brisket/tendon pot was so delicious! Our usual favourite, pork belly, never disappoints. There wasn't a long wait today, which was a bit of a surprise. I guess weeknights aren't as busy. However, they missed one of our orders and actually thanked us for not giving them a hard time. Thank you for the dessert! :)

If you're going with a big group, make sure to call in for a reservation (only for 8+ people)."}
{"text":"Authentic and affordable Chinese food close to home! I was so happy to find the restaurant moving closer home. There is not much good Chinese food in the area.

I remember the first time I tried out this restaurant was a couple of years ago when it was still located near the Agincourt Go station. My friends took me here because they are known for their Hong Kong style crabs. It's been years since I've been back only because I had no one to share a whole crab with.

I ordered eggplant with braised tofu ($6.95), stir-fry snowpea leaves with garlic($12), and my favourite HK style crab ($25). There are at least 20 items under the $6.95 menu if you aren't looking for anything fancy. Dinner is certainly affordable without having to go to a Chinese food court. They also carry fresh seafood. I like to know that the fish that I'm about to eat is swimming in a clean tank."}
{"text":"How long has it been? About 10 years or so since I last visited? This is once my go to spot for quick and cheap Chinese fix. Back in the day when they were closer to Midland with the huge crowds, cramp space and lack of parking. Times have changed and they have certainly grown to a much bigger institution but somehow they managed to keep every single one of their staff from 10 years ago? LOL wow!

Times have changed but the food and service has not. Well, the food has deteriorated a little as you don't really taste much of the wok hay (it's a Chinese cuisine thing). The flavours and the techniques are still there but just not quite as brash as they once were. It's almost like they've deliberately tamed the flavours perhaps to cater to the new crowd. A mixed crowd of South East Asians (Indians, Fillipinos and of course Chinese) rather than the Canto folks back in it's heydays. Which is strange as the current demographics can certainly appreciate bold flavours; perhaps even more so. Anyhow, history lessons aside.

You do still get that tremendous Scarberia value for your food. It is still delicious. They still do have a vast menu and lots of items that non-Chinese folks wouldn't be able to decipher from the menus to the dishes written on sheets of neon paper glued to the walls (very Canto-esque).

The service is swift and adequate. Bonus items include free daily soup and orange slices at the end of your meal.

All in all, a great place for a great Canto meal for cheap. The new location is clean, well lit and definitely an upgrade from it's former past. The food is good, just not quite as good as I had remembered them to be."}
{"text":"The Royal is located on Sheppard in this plaza with the crappiest of parking. The place outside is so plain, but is decent inside. They have kind of the cheap Chinese Canto look except they've got the specials plastered on construction paper lined along the walls. Specials menu is in Chinese so bring someone who can read Chinese. Grab your token Asian.

Our ordering method was basically looking at other tables and pointing at their dishes shamelessly. Had the Steamed Shrimp atop Fried Rice, Beef with ginger and onion, Clams with Minced Pork, as well as green beans.

The Fried Rice with Steamed Shrimp ($15) dish was good. I like how they cook it in a bamboo steamer atop a lotus leaf and there is no issue with portion at all. There was so much rice and the shrimp portion wasnt too bad either. They sort of butterfly the shrimp and some garlic bits are tossed in. Not enough flavor on the shrimp though.

The Clams with Minced Pork were OK. I enjoyed how large and meaty the clams were, but found the dish to be pretty dry overall. The minced pork was dry and in turn, kind of made the whole dish a bit dry. I like that they shuck the clams for you though. Less work for my lazy bum. 

Beef with ginger and onion were on par with most places. The meat was good and there was plenty of it. The green beans were also tossed with minced pork but this one was better. The grease actually works a bit and makes for a flavorful overall plate.

If you're thinking about coming, get here early. This place gets packed and they have a bunch of larger tables so if you're a small party of 3 like mine, you might even have to wait longer. Prices are good as they have lots of dishes for $6.45 which is real good. It's supposed to be a seafood restaurant, but many of the dishes didn't look so good and seemed overpriced so I never did try it."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favourite Chinese restaurant in Scarborough.
Super fresh, super tasty! But a really good place for the seafood lovers. They have a couple of really good beef dishes, but in my opinion, not really somewhere to go if you are looking for chicken. Over the years it has gotten a little bit more $$ but still a great spot! 

Favourite Dishes
-Hot and Sour Soup
-Beef with Black bean sauce on skillet
-deep fried squid
-eggplant and shrimp hot pot
-deep fried king crab
-cantonese chow mein"}
{"text":"The fried colon(?) for $9-10 is great.  
Stir fried beef is good.
Clams were standard.  

Portion size is generally good as well."}
{"text":"I was once told that if you are looking to find an authentic Chinese restaurant, find out the number of Asians dining at the restaurant. Going by that standard, this one for sure looks like a genuine one. But you'll find more than just Asians here. I love the fact that this restaurant is open till late hours (1.30 am) on certain days. My wife and I watch a late night movie and then stop by this place. We always ask for a \"Chicken Shrimp\" fried rice as our order and they accommodate the ask. The dishes are good and the service is very prompt. The folks are efficient (believe in delivering fast than having a small chat) and also cater to take outs. The washrooms are clean. Overall, it's a good value for money place."}
{"text":"Was here for dinner.  Pretty packed for a Monday night.  Food was very delicious and it came fast.  Servers were nice.  Free soup and dessert.  Full marks for price and service. I'll come back."}
{"text":"The Royal is usually my type of family dinner restaurant.  Cheap, simple dishes that scream wok air.  I heard good things of Royal previously, too.  Cheapest dishes started at $7.99.  Portion was generous per price.  I looked past the excessive oiliness, as it was fully understandable that the cooks didn't have time to clean the wok between every dish.  I just couldn't looked past the amount of MSG used.  This type of restaurants always use MSG.  It was about how much was used.  But Royal really only used MSG and skipped the salt.  I was thirsty throughout the meal.  I kept drinking tea.  There are other options in the vicinity, so I doubt l will return.

FYI, we dined on a Thursday.  Maybe the cooks of other days would cook differently."}
{"text":"So apparently a common denominator that my group shared when we arrived at this restaurant was they many of us have drove passed it at some point, but has never stopped to check out the food. Well this time we finally have and so far it seems like a restaurant worth revisiting. 

Environment:
The plaza at Sheppard/Birchmount was renovated quite recently that I still have fond memories of what it used to be.However, like many within my group, none of us have revisited the plaza after the renovated was done. 
I find that the parking lot is quite busy as there aren't enough parking space to accommodate all the traffic to the restaurants at this plaza. Also, the drivers seem to be quite rude and drive recklessly, a common horror that I experience at many Chinese oriented plazas. 
To my surprise, the restaurant doesn't seem to be very well renovated upon walking in. Somehow the decor feels like it is stuck in the 70s, which reminds me of traditional HK restaurants, where you see promo dishes written on colourful construction paper hanging on the wall. The space is quite large though, with many large round tables, which can easily accommodate for big groups or special events.    

Food:
Between the 8 of us we ordered 9 dishes to share. We didn't order the group combo with set dishes because many people in my party felt that the price was too high and they didn't want to get those expensive seafoods. We opted for the Neighbour's special menu instead, where they have close to $40 items to choose from at $7.95 each. A good thing about the menu is that on one side it's in Chinese, and on the back it's fully translated in English.
Some of the things that we ordered that I really liked include the honey short ribs, deep fried noodle with seafood, seafood hot casserole, deep fried squid, and mapo tofu (it is actually spicy!). The restaurant offers complementary soup before the meal and dessert after. Normally they serve oranges with fortune cookies for dessert, however, they ran out of oranges that time so we got taro tapioca sweet cold soup (??????) instead. The sweet soup was really good and they use real taro and not the power stuff.

Service:
Most of the servers there predominantly speak Cantonese, but they can understand Mandarin and English as well. Overall the service is average, they did satisfy all our requests, but don't expect them to come to you with smile on their face. 
During our experience there they take both cash and credit card."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and delicious yet affordable food! My family loves it here and it's one of our main go-to restaurants for family dinners. This place is really busy though so it's best to avoid peak hours."}
{"text":"The food was undercooked and terrible.  When we told them that the pork was raw, they ignored us and wouldn't take it back.  They charged for the dish and had the nerve to chase us after we left to demand a tip.  Stay away from this restaurant or be prepared to get food poisoning."}
{"text":"This place is the type of Chinese restaurant that was everywhere in Toronto back in the day, but is fast becoming a novelty.

I am talking about tasty, no BS, great seafood, real deal, no chicken balls, waiters that talk fast, start with a free bowl of soup, Hong Kong style Chinese food.  The type of place with great seafood, classic meat and veg dishes, and menu items written vertically on pieces of paper on the wall.  It's not fancy, but it works.

You would expect this place to be dirty, but the funny thing is that it is probably cleaner than most of the restaurants out there.  Don't believe me?  Check out their washroom. Probably the cleanest one around (and that includes the more expensive ones out there).

Despite being really authentic Chinese food, you find a cool mixture of all types of people here so don't be shy."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Royal for years, and I haven't had a bad experience to date. The parking lot tends to be busy on weekends, but don't fret - there are parking spaces at the plaza behind the restaurant and it's only a two minute walk away. The restaurant itself is usually crowded but the wait time for a table is short. The staff are very friendly here which contributes to the overall family-like environment. 

Bonus: they are open past midnight! I've been here for late night dinners and the dishes still come out fresh and quick.  

I've tried almost every dish here. Some of the best dishes are the fried garlic chili pork chops, eggplant and braised tofu pot, black pepper beef. If you like seafood, house style spicy crab with ground pork, spicy salted squid, spicy fish & vegetables (celery and snow peas), and fried fish covered in corn sauce are solid options. Also, the steamed garlic shrimp rice which comes in a bamboo steamer is a must-try if you feel like having something substantial and different from plain ol' white rice.  

One of the things that I love about here is you get a complementary soup and dessert. The soup comes as an appetizer and it is flavourful and light. Majority of the time they give orange slices or sweet red bean/taro dessert at the end of the meal, which is great after consuming oily foods. 

Overall, I'd recommend the Royal if you're looking for an affordable and tasty meal at a place that feels like home!"}
{"text":"For what it is, its one of the best around. Your classic Cantonese dinner casual restaurant. Excellent value, all dishes cooked the way they're meant to be, and it comes with complimentary soup to start, and a free traditional dessert. These types of restaurants used to be plentiful everywhere in Scarborough, but they've been gradually disappearing. There's always a long line up and this place is always busy."}
{"text":"Great late night location. Serving Chinese, HK, Hakka, Indo-Chinese type dishes. The operating times are the big plus, closing at 1:30am every day. 

Compared to its counterparts within the area I would personally recommend Royal Chinese. The restaurant is clean, quick staff, reasonable prices, good portions, and overall the food is great. 

Straight forward menu. The calamari is also a great option, would recommend asking for some lime. My typical order consists of: 
- chili chicken 
- chicken fried rice 
- calamari ( dont forget the lime ) 
- occasional shrimp 

No problems with the food, consistent quality. Overall considering how late they operate, prices, and the food would recommend and would go again."}
{"text":"This place is nice as it opens late, so if you're looking for some authentic Chinese cuisine for a late supper (siu yeah), here is the place to go! They have a pretty extensive menu as well. Heard the head chef has 30+ years of Chinese cuisine experience so food quality and taste will not disappoint. Only problem I have with the food though is it's just a tad bit on the oily side (but as is with many Chinese cuisines). Don't have too much comments on customer service because they seem to be pretty decent especially to frequent customers, and large groups as I've seen."}
{"text":"Can't complain about anything.  Service was good and so was the food. We were seated right away and the wait staff were very polite and friendly. My daughters who are pretty fussy, liked everything that we ordered and I didn't have to force them to eat anything.  I'm already looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Usually i hate reviewing chinese restaurants because they are more or less usually the same kinda deal wherever you go.
however one thing i will say about this place was that the food here did not feel heavy when eating. i left the restaurant noticeably full, light, but feeling healthier than usual after leaving a chinese place."}
{"text":"This is more of a local place, very affordable and quick service.  But if you are a tourist like myself expecting to be impressed, you should pass since there are better options.  It's not that it's bad but I didn't taste anything exceptional w/ a wow factor.  Tea was subpar and service was quick but sloppy.  Being so busy due to lower pricing, I am very concerned over cleanliness, especially the seafood tanks.  Not sure if it's the clams dish I tried but my oral cavity swelled up for days afterwards."}
{"text":"Was there recently for my mom's birthday at her request. Super authentic, amazing prices, great quality food. My only misgiving is they're heavy handed on salt/soy. Don't miss the black bean clams, spicy squid and green beans! Next time I'll test their fish from their aquarium, cus that is how I guage a good Chinese restaurant. Service was good. We got there at about 5:30 on a Thursdsay and it was packed by 7! Low prices mean nothing if the food isn't good, and we weren't disappointed! If we didn't order drinks, our dinner for 5 was less than 75$ with leftovers!(before tip). Note* complimentary chicken soup appetizer and fresh oranges or sweet bean soup for dessert."}
{"text":"Pros: There is value at this restaurant that makes classic Cantonese dishes well. It is the place to go for late night as it closes past midnight.

Cons: As my sister said, \"Remove the msg.\" I said it's impossible to see it. But low and behold there is so much msg on the salt and pepper pork chops that you could actually see it. 

Not open until 3:30 p.m. The decor is minimal, though very bright. 

Usual dishes I get are beef fried noodle, chicken fried rice, salt and pepper pork , salt and pepper squid, pork and eggplant pot ."}
{"text":"I don't know.... I really don't know...

Everything we ordered were little off tonight... and it was not the first time I found that happened to me. I been to The Royal Chinese Restaurant numerous of time even at it's old location.

Black Bean Clam ($11.95) was not bad.... My Yelp Friend enjoyed them and even ended up lining up the shells for a photo opp

Mushroom with Vegetables ($6.95) was great value though on the saucy side

XO Fried Fish Fillet ($9.95) was undercooked and still kind of raw inside. Looking at each other, we know that we were not going to send it back.... but instead taking it home and heated that up in the microwave and it was ready to enjoy for midnight snack. At least I know some one was not going to bed hungry.

All the dishes we ordered lack the HOT out of the wok taste, which is the essence of Cantonese cooking.

The staffs were super friendly and chatting with us like we are long lost friends....."}
{"text":"Dinner was so good.  Excellent quality, freshness, and flavour that hit every spot. Check out my photos and \"taste\" it for yourself.  Too bad I manged to take only a few shots... too busy eating!  :D  We were happy and satisfied with some take-outs.

We were a group of 2 large tables and we ordered a bunch of seafood and meat items and served to us before we noticed our hunger.  Service was friendly, nice & efficient.

Its a very casual place with a huge dining area.  Got very busy later in the dinner hours.  Seems to be a very popular place!"}
{"text":"Will somebody please take me back here!?!? We found it in the middle of a snowstorm, just looking for a place to pull over, and my goodness I didn't want to leave. I could have sat and ate there all night. 

The black bean clams were fantastic. My dining partner doesn't eat clams. Be wary, its a giant plate of clams. We also shared a noodle dish. The service was attentive and very sweet. They took good care of us. 

I wanted to try everything on the menu. Can't wait to get back and try more."}
{"text":"We love coming here for good Chinese food and the staff is super friendly. 

Some great dishes are their crab, birds nest, deep fried tofu and more plus I like that hey close later if you are craving for some Chinese food."}
{"text":"This place was better back at their old location. Came here with a family of 20 and luckily we had made reservations as there was quite a wait on your usual Saturday night dinner hour.

Seated at 2 large tables, we ordered their 10 course meal special which came to about $250~$300/table of 10. This restaurant is a bit cheaper than what you might expect compared to other similar restaurants. However, it became obvious why that price point was set a bit lower. Portions were a bit smaller than what we were used to, but still enough to fill you up. Taste wise was our family's biggest complaint. Dishes served were either bland or were doused in too much sauce. I think my biggest issue was with their fried crab claws - instead of at least a little bit of actual crab meat inside the claw itself, it was imitation crab paste which threw me off. 

Service wise, nothing special, but nothing off-putting either. They have some photos of their dishes in their menu which might help out those who can't read Chinese or can't decode their English translations - saw a few tables of restaurateurs who weren't Chinese be able to order quite a number of dishes.

If you frequent these types of Chinese restaurants, I would strongly recommend you go elsewhere, even if you are forking a bit more money. However, if you're not too picky and just looking for something quick and cheap to fill you up - then this place would be a good option!"}
