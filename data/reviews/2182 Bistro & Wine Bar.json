{"text":"mediocre.  the food is okay, but nothing to rave about.  for the price you could definitely find something better.  i ordered a shrimp pasta, which had tasty homemade (i think) noodles, but there were TINY little cut up pieces of shrimp in the pasta.  for $18 i think they could have put a few whole shrimp in the dish.  kind of lame.  they could also use some less expensive wines on the list.  probably wont be back."}
{"text":"New Grand Opening! Bistro 2182.
They are open for business!

Food Menu is all New. New Owners and New Executive Chef. 

Great place to dine. Food is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Plenty of good, and plenty left to be desired.  They were pretty busy when we got there, and I joined my party a few minutes after they got there, but sat for almost ten minutes before our server made it back to us.  Ordered a couple appetisers, which came out in acceptable, bit slow time.  The mashed potatoes under the short rib where too watery, but the short rib was tender and delicious.  The meatloaf was a similar story.  Our entrees eventually followed, and we were pretty happy with the quality, one of us ordered the scallops after seeing the table next to ours, and how huge the scallops and portion size were, only to get a few scallops instead of the seven the other table got, then hearing the waitress tell the next table they ran out.  If they didn't have enough they should have suggested something else, or told her she could have an appetiser portion, because it certainly wasn't a meal.  The creme brûlée was TINY, but desserts are too big just like most peoples guts, so I'll let that go.  Overall, I wouldn't take anyone there if I was trying to impress them, but if someone suggests it, I would tag along."}
{"text":"We took my parents there for their birthdays on a Saturday night.  The place was very cozy and when we got there there were only 2 other tables occupied.  We ordered a bottle of wine, which took the server 15 minutes to bring to us.  

Steadily the place started filling up, but we noticed there were only 2 servers on all night.  We received our appetizers and soups but had to continually ask for refills for my daughter and for water.  We also asked for bread, which we never received.  

We asked for another bottle of wine and had to remind her for it.  The main course was delicious, but all in all the experience was more like Applebee's instead of fine dining.  Our bill for 5 people and 2 bottles of wine came to over $200.

When we emailed the manager/owner we didn't even receive a response.  We were very disappointed and will never go there again.  We would much rather go to Don's or Del Monico's for special occasions where they truly appreciate patronage."}
{"text":"We booked a reservation for 6 people on a Friday night... they gave us the high top table in the bar. However, they also promised another table of 4 the same seats. Whomever was in charge of the reservations said nothing and left us all mulling around the table, everyone too nervous to sit down. My party eventually got the table because we larger, but there was no mention of the snafu by the staff,

Ordering drinks was a debacle. My husband ordered a white russian (which was forgotten) and it took us 45 minutes to flag down our serve and re-request the drink. Both the appetizers and entrees were messed up and people in our party did not get what they ordered.

I can't comment on the food because after two hours of waiting, anything tastes good. The entire time we were there, the waiter visited our table prolly 3 times (to greet us, take the order and give the food).

(I realized this is my first review but this restaurant annoyed me enough that I need to tell others to not patronize it.)"}
{"text":"My husband and I have always been a big fan of 2182.  In fact, it is by far the best restaurant in Brecksville.  We were shocked when we learned that 2182 had closed in April 2009 due to some tax problems.  However, it has since re-opened under new ownership and new chef.  The menu has changed quite a bit but the last time we visited our meal was excellent!!  We both ordered the specials.  I had the scallops which was actually an appetizer and my husband had a filet.  We went on a Thursday night and the restaurant was empty except for one other couple.  Perhaps many people do not know that it has reopened.  I would highly recommend 2182!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I really wanted to like this place as there is a shortage of good restaurants near our home.  We stopped in for a drink to check the place out.  The bartender gave us menus to look at and talked about the chef and the dishes he prepares.  But wait, what was that smell I picked up on immediately upon entering the restaurant?  Ah, maybe it was nothing...back to the menu...which had a lot of interesting dishes on it.  We paid our bar bill and told him we would be back to eat, but as we walked out, I smelled it again...the smell was mold, like you would get after your basement flooded.  There's no way I could eat in a place that smelled like this.  Seriously, they really need to do something about that.
If they can fix this, I'd gladly give them another try."}
{"text":"This place was cute. I think they had about 12 tables in the whole place so def make a reservation. The service was OK. I think she was preoccupied with a larger group or more tables so my husband and I's tiny table for 2 was on the low end of her priority list. We had to ask if we could order drinks.  Really? Service 101 would frown upon this...

The food was good but not mind blowing. The prices were like those of a super fine dining restaurant like Lola's but didn't live up to the hype like Lola's does. We had the oysters, which were delicious b/c they were oysters.  Then my husband got the filet special.  His filet was cooked to his request (Med-Rare) and tasted good.  Nothing \"special\" about it though.  I ordered the Halibut.  It was a nice cut of fish and the beurre blanc was the best part. 

They have $6 Martini specials on Mon & Wed so I may go back to check that out and give it another chance.

Side note: Saw 2 older gentleman with leather blazers on.  Is that a trend I am unaware of?"}
{"text":"OMG. I thought the place would be classy. Not only did I have to ask to order, they served me a drink that I didn't order. In addition, they didn't know the difference between potato and parsnip. And yet, the place was full. OMG!"}
{"text":"So we went back on a Monday night just as they opened for dinner.  We were the first in, and seated pretty quick.  Our seat was nice and warm at first and near the front of the restaurant.  For some unknown reason it became cold rather quickly.

Our orders were started....the waiter started to walk away after taking our appetizers and having had bad experience there prior we asked to put in entire order upfront.  He obliged.

We ordered a cup of lobster bisque for the lady, I ordered a Caeser salad with anchovies on the side.

Our appetizers were homemade pierogies and some kind of salmon ball delight (which was truly delightful)

Meals were grilled lampchop and pan seared halibut.

A 2nd couple came in about ten minutes after soup/salad/ and appetizers but they were served main course prior to ours after we had already put in our choices. This seemed quite odd, but based on prior experience here not totally surprising. 

Our dessert was homemade blueberry ice cream and chocolate cake.

Once again....the overall selection was nothing spectacular.  The salmon special was really good, and so was the lamb chop...Blue berry ice cream was tasy as well.....the rest....just seemed kind of plain.

The service again was kinda average and nothing blew me away.

I have to stick with a 2 on this place.....If I had spent full price (we were there on another groupon visit) I would have most likely been more upset.

This place isnt bad....but it just lacks inspiration.

I do miss the old ownership alot."}
{"text":"I went to 2182 a couple of days ago with my wife, dad, and stepmom for my stepmom's birthday.  I'm not sure where they heard of it, as they are from \"somewhat\" out of town.

2182 is a charming and tiny little restaurant.  It seats about 35 people and has a bar for around 10-12, 20 if you include some bar-level tables in the middle of the restaurant.

This is one of those places where, when you are there for the first time, you feel out of place because the bar is populated with regulars.  The bartender knew everyone's names but ours.  He made us a round of good (not great) cocktails.  He was a good bartender, but the ice wasn't cold enough to not dilute my Manhattan or my wife's Martini.

There was only one server, but it was a Monday night and there were only 3-4 tables seated while we were there.  Our service was very slow, but not in a relaxing yet attentive kind of way.  It was just slow.  Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable, and we enjoyed our time with him, but it would have been nice to see him two or three more times throughout the evening.

Our food was good, again not great.  I ordered the bibb salad with strawberries and gorgonzola, and the dressing lacked any real depth of flavor.  It just kind of made the lettuce wet.  The gorgonzola and strawberries were nice, though.  I did try my wife's Caesar, and it was good.  I make my own, scratch (and the old fashioned way in a big wood bowl), so I am spoiled by that, but this was a good Caesar for a restaurant that doesn't specialize in them.

I ordered the duck two ways, and I enjoyed it.  The rice pilaf was (as it usually is) kind of a cop out side dish.  Just a loose little pile of rice.  A throwaway filler side.  There was maybe a tablespoon of the \"chutney\"... 

My wife got the prime rib, and it was decent.  Very basic dish with horseradish mashed potatoes and broccolini.  Broccolini was on all of our plates.

My dad got the sirloin and was unimpressed, but that is par for the course for him.  He is nearly incapable of being impressed at a restaurant - his expectations are just too high for a mediocre cut of beef.

I did not try my stepmom's lamb, but she loved it.

2182's wine list is small but very interesting and I'd say that it is quite good.  They have two of my favorites, The Prisoner and Paraduxx.  We didn't have either, but our wines were good.

The highlight of the evening other than the company and conversation was the chocolate ice cream.  Our server hyped it pretty good... \"the best we'll have ever had.\"  He brought out four very small scoops (we ordered one dish - it was the right amount for one dish), and it looked kind of . . . lame.  It was slightly melted and not a very dark brown at all.  I wondered how it could be the best I'd ever had and dug in for my spoonful.

Best I've ever had?  Tough to say.  In the conversation?  Yep.  We were all intrigued, as it was clearly not sweetened with white cane sugar.  The cocoa was more of an underlying passenger flavor - this was not an overwhelmingly chocolatey ice cream.  This interesting sweetness, though, really got us going.  We threw around a few ideas (demerera sugar, molasses, brown sugar...) but had apparently had too much to drink to come up with the obvious answer - honey.

All in all, a very pleasurable experience because it was new to us and we were more into our time together than we were the details of our dining experience.  But objectively, my salad dressing lacked flavor, my entree was only modestly composed, and our service was merely decent.  If I lived in Brecksville, I could see making this place a regular stop, but I don't see making the 45-minute drive any time soon."}
{"text":"For starters, this review has been influenced by groupon.  We were given a dinner here by a friend, so I didn't have the same critical eye I would have spending ~$100 for dinner.  
We didn't have reservations, so the only available spot was at a \"bar/table\" in the middle of the restuarant sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with 2 different couples we didn't know.  1 couple left & was followed by a single lady who quickly became part of our dinner experience.  It was as if we were sitting at the bar, but sitting at a table at the same time, which is fine for a local dinner, but not the ambience I'm looking for when going out for something higher-end. I suppose we have no one to blame but ourselves for not scheduling reservations.
I ordered a few shrimp, my wife ordered a salad & we shared a big Delmonico steak.  The shrimp were standard issue, as was the salad & the Delmonico was slightly above average, though was quite fatty.  I had a few beers, my wife a glass of wine, we finished with coffee & spent ~$100 (which is a little steep for sharing an entree).
Probably more a true \"meh-I've experienced better,\" but the groupon factor moved it up to a 3."}
{"text":"My husband and I (we live in Southern CA) and family (live in Brecksville) have had consistently good food, wine and service at 2182.  My husband is a world traveler and whenever he arrives in Cleveland he asks me to make reservations here, over Lola and other great places in Cleveland.  The food is always very good, the service is attentive but not overbearing and the atmosphere is quaint.  I really enjoy eating at 2182 and would recommend any dish.  It's a rather eclectic menu, but I wouldn't doubt there is an item for everyone' s taste. Also, it's fantastic that they have a full bar and not just beer/wine service.  I would also recommend stopping here for a great cocktail and appetizer before hopping on 77 and going somewhere downtown for dinner. I would definitely return and recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Went to dinner at 2182 last night with friends for my birthday. Had a great evening and a great meal. I had the 2182 signature steak which was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious. Tony the bartender was very knowledgeable and engaging and provided excellent service. I will definitely be headed back here soon..."}
{"text":"I really expected, based on news paper reviews, this would be a better then my experience. The service we not friendly. Our waitress seemed to just \"put up with us\". 
We ordered soup and salad, then moments later our entrees arrived. The pasta was over cooked and the sauce was just average. The veal was just average. Nothing jumped out at us. The Veal Paprikash was too buttery and the expresso was watery. 
We were absolutely underwhelmed. I've heard this the best place to dine in Brecksville. I certainly disagree with this comment. I'll stick to Tremont."}
