{"text":"Another great find thanks to Yelp.  It was around 10:15pm and I was feeling for some dessert.  My husband found Village 1668 on Yelp and he said \"they have macarons!\" I do love me some good macarons, but for some odd reason my craving them morphed into a craving for dumplings.  I was shocked when he said \"oh they have that too.\"  LOL.  So off we went.  We got there just before 10:30pm and the owner welcomed us in and was very hospitable (we actually didn't realize that they closed at 10:30pm until after we left and returned to our hotel).  Since we didn't know they were closing, we decided to eat in and the owner was super nice and didn't rush us at all.  I got the dumplings in peanut butter sauce ($5.50).  My husband was originally going to get General Tao's Chicken, but then he saw \"General Tao's Chicken Poutine\" on the menu ($7.95), and he could not believe his eyes, he loves General Tao's Chicken and he LOVES poutine, so needless to say, that's what he ordered.  The owner asked us if we wanted some tea with our meal, and we said sure.  She said she would make us some Hong Kong Milk Tea ($2.50 a cup) and I love HK Milk Tea, so I said \"great!\"  Now this restaurant has a very unusual vibe.  It looks like a tea house, complete with fancy teacups and teapots on display and for sale, and lots of different teas for sale too.  They have an antique stove as a decoration and some nice paintings on the wall.  They also have French pastries.  But then, they also sell Chinese food!  The owner said their specialty is Sichuan food.  The Chinese food menu is limited to General Tao's Chicken (their specialty) on it's own or as a poutine, a few noodle dishes, a few rice dishes and dumplings.  Then they also serve fish and chips, and sandwiches!  Not a conventional combination, but hey I can like unconventional :)      We got the dumplings first and shared them.  We got 8 dumplings and they were covered in peanut sauce with a touch of chili oil.  They were very tasty, even though the filling to wrapper ratio was little on the low side.  The sauce was full of peanut flavour and it wasn't too rich (which I appreciated).  My only complaint (and it's just personal preference) is that it had too strong of a hoisin flavour for my liking.  It had the tiniest spicy kick to it.  We also shared the General Tao's Poutine.  We were pleasantly surprised by the amount of chicken we got.  The portion was generous, that's for sure!  They use real cheese curds and the fries were lightly battered.  The sauce was part tangy and part sweet with a bit of spice.  There were whole dried chilies in it (which we didn't eat).  The breading on the chicken wasn't excessive, and they use brown meat, but it wasn't too fatty or gristly.    The HK Milk Tea was really rich and sweet.  It was good but too rich and sweet for both of us.    The owner was very friendly and when we engaged her in conversation, she told us a lot about her restaurant.  They just opened a few months ago and it's usually run by her son.  Their family also owns Piment 2 in Old Montreal.  Service was top notch.  She came and refilled our waters and checked up on us appropriately. Although it should be said that we were the only customers there.  All in all, this place was great.  Good food, low prices and excellent service!  We'd come back for sure."}
{"text":"Brand new dessert shop near the corner of Concordia university. A wide arrange of French pastries and Asian snacks! I really enjoyed the Cheese Cake and Chinese tea offered here. There are lots of nice paintings in the cafe to relax and enjoy. Note that they are still improving on their menu and will continue to add more pastries and cakes. Will come back in a month to see how this place turns out! A nice quiet atmosphere to study for those that are students. Ask for Clayton if you want to learn more about his tea club!"}
{"text":"Was on my way to a nearby Asian haunt on de Maisonneuve when a glimpse inside this cute place stopped me in my tracks. Peeked inside and the warm decor suggested there was something special here, and my resto radar did not disappoint. Run by a friendly welcoming family, the menu consists of a few simple choices (General Tao, Dumplings, a selection of sandwiches, a nicely varied tea list) as well as a range of delicate pastries for dessert. Arriving at the end of the day, I was expecting nothing more than your average food-court General Tao experience, but this was a cut above. Prepared to order, served with freshly fried rice, delicious sauteed cabbage and a small dish of chili paste, the dinner knocked my socks off. The man and woman who run the place were super friendly and nice to chat with. The atmosphere is perfect for a meal, dessert, studying or gathering with friends. They have a very nice selection of tea paraphernalia too (teapots and high quality loose teas from Camellia Sinensis). I will definitely be back!"}
