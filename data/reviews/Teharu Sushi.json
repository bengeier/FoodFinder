{"text":"Didn't even get to sit down because we were appalled by their rude attitude. Incredibly rude waiter and two waitresses. We went to In-n-out for a great service and clean food. We will never go to Teharu."}
{"text":"Ive been here many times, the food is great and at a good price. The drinks are also great (5 dollars for Sake and Beer!) and so is the service. Its alot of fun and there is great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Terrible service I have never experienced such terrible service it began with the hostess not taking the time to understand what I was saying to her. I came alone and I was waiting on my family she rushed me in sat me down and left. I tried to accommodate and figured out the pricing for the plates and just make the best of it. I had plenty of seating next to me that would fit my family so I didn't worry but once someone sat down I told another one of the host/server that I had my family coming he simply said no. I was blown away by his response my family and I had made a special trip to visit this cool conveyor sushi restaurant and come to find out I could have gotten better service at jack n box.  I tried talking to a manager when when I spoke to one of the girls in Spanish she confided in me that the owners are just as bad just as rude and are quick to kick people out if the restaurant isn't full."}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun and inexpensive for sushi.  The sushi tastes like it is pretty good quality, but isn't the best.  I really enjoy the conveyor belt aspect and inexpensiveness because it allows me to try things I wouldn't normally order at a sushi restaurant.  Everything is $2 or less so if you don't like it it isn't a concern.  You can also order anything on the menu that you don't see and it will be on the same colored plates and cost the same as everything on the conveyor belt.  I really have enjoyed my experiences here."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best yet cheap sushi place that Im totally in love with. Their service is decent but their food is the grand prize , my fiancé and I went out last night and ate so much and totally was under 30. The only sushi place that i would go to and get my fix :D"}
{"text":"Thought this would be a fun place to take the kids. Our 8 year old refused to try the sushi but loved the chicken teriyaki. The 12 year old got yakitori that was a little dry but still thought it was good. We liked trying new rolls we haven't tried before and the fact that we all got full for $30. Yes there are better sushi places but the sushi was still good here and the conveyer belt entertained the kids."}
{"text":"You're not going to get a more authentic Sushi experience in AZ than Teharu. With its revolving conveyor belt of standard sushi fare, you can get in and out quick!  Best of all you can get out cheap too!  The prices are unbelievably low. But...the food is GOOD, not great. Still, it is so convenient and reasonable we keep coming back. The convenience and value make it a great place to introduce little kids to Sushi, which we did with our 5 and 6 year old girls. Plus the facility is current, clean and the service good."}
{"text":"TIP: DO NOT TRY TO GO IN EARLY. YOU WILL NOT GET FED ANY SUSHI IN A TIMELY MANER.  This review is purely based on service.  So I've eaten here a few times and the service is sub par. They don't get your drinks quick enough and getting the attention of our server can get tricky.  Normally, I have dinner at Teharu. Today, I wanted to try something different for lunch. Like most people, lunch is a relativity short period of time. I wanted to grab something and get out. They open 11 am so a couple of buddies and I thought we come in right at 11.  We walked in the door at 10:57 and nothing was on the conveyor belt. This was a bad sign already. We should have headed into NYPD for a slice of pizza. They made us wait for about 5 minutes which was reasonable. We sat down. They actually got our drink order pretty quickly since we were the first ones to arrive.  The older lady came back with our drinks and by that time, we have been sitting for about 5 minutes. The only thing going around the conveyor was cream puffs, cheesecake, and soda. Knowing that I had a time crunch, I wanted to place my sushi order so that I can finish my lunch and be on my way. The older lady flat out said no. \"The sushi chefs are busy\" and walked away. I was astounded. Seriously? If your hours of operations say 11 am, you should be ready to feed your customers at 11 am.  She came back after 5 minutes realizing what she had said. She asked 1 out of 3 people what they wanted. We order 4 plates of one roll. She came back with only 2!  We ended up staying 30 more minutes, attempting to get some sushi. The options at 11:30 were very limited. After sitting for 30 minutes, I didn't see a single crunch roll, Philly roll, California roll, or dragon roll and we were prohibited from making requests.  Our meal was 19 dollars and some change for 3 people. THREE PEOPLE! We were ready to get our grub on and eat some sushi and the server basically said, no, you can't get your sushi right now because we are busy with opening the restaurant.  This was poor customer service. I requested our bill at 11:30 and it took another server 5 minutes to come back and count our plates.  In the end, I had maybe 3 plates of sushi. I was starving still and I took 15 minutes extra for lunch because I didn't want to walk out on Teharu Sushi. I was pretty forgiving but they simply wasted my lunch hour today. I now know to never go to Teharu during my lunch. There is a high chance I won't make it back in time and have my sushi!!!!! :("}
{"text":"Normally, I love this place and always recommend it to my friends. However recently, there has been less than awesome service. I went in the other day and there was a huge line, only half of the belt open. On top of that, waiting forever, the waitress doesn't listen when I tell her my name, and seats people who came after us. Luckily the food is amazing and cheap, otherwise I would find another place."}
{"text":"I seriously love this place. Great sushi without breaking the bank and the ability to try multiple types of rolls without having to commit to a full roll you may not like."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but lately I've been noticing that they have a bug problem.   Last time I was there, I saw a roach looking type of bug scurrying up the wall. My sister brought her visiting friend here, and there was a bug on the plate of sushi. When they told the server she looked at the bug, and then squashed it with her finger on the plate. This is highly disgusting.   It makes me wonder, f there's bugs in the dining room, what does the back kitchen look like?  I really hate to give this place a bad review, because they food was good, prices are cheap, and who can beat a $5 sake bomb? But after these experiences with witnessing bugs I'm never going back."}
{"text":"Sushi was mediocre for what I have experienced. The server nor chef knew what agedashi (tempura style tofu) was or how to make. Service was decent but not very attentive. The philly roll and hawaiian roll were decent. I am from out of town and originally decided to go to NYPD Pizza but saw teharu had a good overall score. I guess I should have looked closer at certain people who reviewed this restaurant."}
{"text":"Possibly one of the worst sushi restaurant's I've ever been to. A small group of friends and I went in and asked to sit at the bar. Well, actually we put our names on a piece of paper. No greeting from the employees, just a silent, wait your turn kind of atmosphere. We knew we probably wouldn't sit together (the restaurant is VERY small and they only utilize half the space), but we figured maybe a spot would open up. We sat down to wait and a party of three walked in. They were seated almost immediately. We tried to ask the waiters what had happened, but they put their hands up repeatedly and continued as they were. We gave them the benefit of the doubt and patiently waited our turn.  20 minutes later two parties got up from their seats leaving six bar seats open in a row. We were so happy! We promptly stood up knowing that we'd be seated next. The owners then seated a party of two that had come in after us in the spots that should have gone to us. We asked to speak to the manager who explained to us that they don't seat \"large parties\" at the bar. We reminded her that we were totally okay with being separated, but she stuck to her ridiculous rule of not seating us.  So here we are, 25 minutes later with no communication letting us know that we were waiting to sit at a table. We asked them to seat us in groups of 2 or individually and the owner continued to explain that we were not welcome at the bar due to our party's size despite that we would all be paying individually. At this point she became hateful and manipulative. She crossed our name off of the top of the hand written list and added our names underneath all of the parties that came in after us. We were so upset that we up and left. We received no customer service (or even interaction) and were treated like an annoyance. If you want to give your money to an entirely rude and spiteful establishment for the sake of a gimmick, go right ahead but I will never be returning."}
{"text":"Heard about it through the grapevine and figured, why the heck not?  We went on a Tuesday evening just after 6pm and waited about 5 minutes to be seated.  We were seated in the VERY LAST BOOTH you could get from the conveyor belt, so that sucked rocks as everything had been picked over.  Still, food was decent.  Spicy tuna was nice and spicy, the tempura roll was still hot from the fryer and the veggie rolls were very crisp and delicious.  The cream puffs were frozen solid and never defrosted.  Didn't get to try any of the salads, but the seaweed salad looked phenomenal.  We weren't given plates to lay our chopsticks on, so we grabbed some empty ones from the conveyor belt as it was hard (being in the corner booth) to get anyone's attention.  They turned OFF the conveyor belt while we were still sitting and munching at our table so a waitress finally walked over and said that if we needed anything to go through her.  Then she disappeared, walking throughout the restaurant.  She was nice....but never came back to us, until we asked for our bill then she got a little bit snotty with *why did we take the plates off the conveyor belt*.    Because we were never given any plates to put our chopsticks on and we didn't want to just lay them on the table or on the dirty plates.  So, they were a little miffy about it since there were drinks or snacks that we could have been charged for (but again, any *normal* person would notice there was an empty snack/soda/juice container on the table to correspond with the empty plate--duh).    I can see how this place would fill up fast and could get insanely crowded.  I just didn't like the fact that they TURNED OFF THE CONVEYOR BELT while we were still sitting and eating--that's a sure sign of them not so subtly saying \"Please leave\".  Really felt like they tried to rush the two last tables on that side of the room OUT the door so they could clean and close up that portion of the restaurant.  I didn't enjoy that.    IT was a little bit loud in there--reminded me of 90's pop rock sung in Japanese--cute, but annoying.  Definitely could have been turned WAY DOWN."}
{"text":"Wife and I got violently ill after dining here. Near food poison. Called and wanted to talk to mgr but spoke poor English and didn't care. Called board if health as only satusfactuin and will obviously never go back. Bad bad bad."}
{"text":"First thing, if you want to celebrate something here with your friends or relatives, makes sure to call for reservation... the place is not that big, and during Weekend, this place it's just packed.  Service is fast, there's not that much variety but some worth mentioned: \"Squid Salad\" and \"Shrimp Tempura Roll\".... yummy... make sure to drink with a Sapporo... then it's a complete package.  The nice thing about eating there is that, at the end, they will stack up your sushi plates... Alllll.... the way up there... it's fun and make the occasion memorable.  With not many options in this area, I'd say Teharu is the best in the valley ;o)"}
{"text":"So bad!   Oh man, I came here with a friend on a Thursday night and I am definitely not coming back.   I'll be the first to admit that sushi in Arizona doesn't really impress me (I'm from California) and this place is added to my list of places to not eat at again.   The sushi going around on the conveyor belt is warm. I got one plate off the belt, didn't like it, and then ordered directly from one of the chefs hoping that it would be better.   I got some maguro nigiri (tuna over some rice) and it was really badly cut and did not taste fresh at all.   I also got some other rolls and pieces of nigiri, and the quality and taste did not impress me. Their Haru Sushi did not taste good and had way too much of the fake crab mix. Almost all of their rolls use that fake crab mix and I hate eating it. I don't know how it first was called a California Roll, but I do my best to never order rolls with it. Give me quality nigiri or sashimi anyday. Sadly, you won't get it.   Save your money and go across the street to In-n-Out."}
{"text":"I finally got around to trying out this revolving sushi joint. I was excited because 1. I've never been to a revolving sushi place before and 2. I heard it was cheap. I wasn't disappointed.  We went on a Tuesday night around 7, and while the place was decently busy, we got seated right away. I think it helped that there were only two of us. There are plenty of tables, but if you want to sit right in front of the conveyor then it's probably best to stick to a group of four or less.   We were asked what we'd like to drink, but other than that it's basically a dig in and help yourself kind of place. (And yes, you might have to get your waiters' attention for more drinks or for the bill, but since you're picking out the food yourself, that makes sense to me. It's going to be hard to tell when someone wants something or is done.) Anyway, it's easy to get excited by all the choices going by you and just start grabbing up everything you see. But stuff does come around multiple times, so next time I think I'll pace myself a bit more :)  They pretty much offer standard sushi rolls, nigiri pieces and Japanese appetizers. It's fresh and pretty good considering the prices of the plates. The food comes on either $1, $1.50 or $2 plates. For those prices you get slightly smaller appetizers and the rolls have four pieces, but it's still an amazing deal. Some specialty rolls or items are a little more than that, as signified by being placed on more than one plate.  They also throw some random things in the mix, like Japanese sodas, juice, and I think I saw a fruit cup. But to me, that's just part of the fun.  All in all, I think we stuffed ourselves on almost 20 plates, got two large sakes, and only spent about $40. Had we not completely stuffed ourselves, we could have easily spent less. I'll definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Amazing...... Everyone should come here! Shaggy Dog, Haru Popper & baked Scallop are to DIE for"}
{"text":"Came in last night with a group of 6 for a bday dinner. One half had the train area and the the other had booths and tables. We expected to be seated at an open booth and we were told it was closed. But there was groups of people sitting at the other booths!! Then we asked if we could sit at a table and just add two chairs at the end so we didn't have to split the group and they said no because it was closed. So we decided to wait for the area that was open for tables. A table opened and the business seated a group of people who came AFTER we came in!! Unacceptable!! We immediately left. Absolutely horrible service."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to dine while stoned. The environment is totally trippy. Made me feel like I was in cloud atlas at the restaurant getting fed people. A+ experience. Plus the house music makes you trip even harder and every one around you will notice. Probably a biased opinion because I've onlu been here under the influence."}
{"text":"It started out okay but we had to end dinner early because of an unexpected visitor. We had to pay for the cockroach's bill too."}
{"text":"The concept of this place is very simple. You come in, you sit down, you grab whatever you want to eat and each dish is color priced. The highest price I believe is 2.50. I got 5 plates of food and a drink and that ended up to be $7. That's it. Cheap sushi! Best of all, although the sushi isn't perfect, its pretty damn good for what you are paying for and the experience. It was simply delicious, i'm coming back!"}
{"text":"Awesome SUSHI RESTAURANT especially the revolving sushi belt. Can not beat that! Great customer service! Also fresh seafood fresh everything!"}
{"text":"Since I started working in Scottsdale, this place has been one of my favorites for a quick lunch with my coworkers.   On my very first visit a few months ago, the friendly host who usually runs the front suggested some of her favorites and even steered me away from ones she didn't think were very good. Her honesty was refreshing and she even boxed up my to go order for me. I have yet to have a bad experience.  The staff is very nice each time we go in and also very attentive. If you want something that's not on the sushi-go-round, all you have to do is ask and they make it for you on the spot. They even play a nice selection of music, too.  My only complaint is that I still haven't worked up the courage to eat whatever that dish is that has the tentacles sticking out of it. That's not their problem though."}
{"text":"Wasn't bad for the money but my wife and I went there yesterday and had an interesting experience. After chowing down on a few rolls we were pretty excited to see one of the chefs (Joe) putting pot stickers in the pan. While watching the chef poor the frozen stickers in the pan he had dropped one onto the FLOOR. Okay not so bad so far right. The next thing we both saw in disbelief was the Chef lean down to pick it up and toss it back into the pan. We both looked at each other as the food fell from my mouth out of disgust and said REALLY? We both confirmed a few times with each other as to what we both saw. Needless to say we promptly exited the restaurant and notified the hostess as to what happened.  I wonder what else goes on in that little dive."}
{"text":"There's a reason people flock to this place, it's cheap. But that's really the main appeal other than the pre-made sushi revolving in front of you. I learned quickly that the staff do not deserve much of a tip because they're not very attentive or trained to refill cups or ask you for your check, etc. I think there's a reason the staff never comes around to ask how everything is going because they'd be getting terrible feedback. Food is okay but even then I've had some bad experiences with getting a roll off the belt and it tasting warm. I dont think sushi should stay in room temperature for as long as they let it.   My word of advice is to not get anything that everyone else is ignoring. Its probably been sitting out for an hour or two. Especially \"Today's special Conchi\" - I don't think anyone's ever actually had it."}
{"text":"Expected to have a great experience based on reviews.  The rotating food was either old or was the same. Try to order and was rudely told to wait then I was totally ignored by the waiting staff. So I went to RA. Was totally worth the extra few pennies and the service is amazing."}
{"text":"I eat here several times a week because the sushi is very fresh, consistently good, and not expensive!! Enjoy...."}
{"text":"AWFUL experience! When we walked in we said there would be 6 and we wanted the bar. After waiting 20 minutes (and a party of 3 and 2 being sat ahead of us) we said we'd split up. Very luckily 6 seats cleared at once at the bar. They sat another party ahead of us! When I asked they said they didn't seat parties of 6 at the bar. They failed to mention this rule before we waited 20 minutes. They were horribly rude when we tried to discuss what was happening. The woman who said she was the manager stopped me mid-sentence and said, \"Can you listen to me for a minute.\"  I couldn't believe how disrespectful she was. They lost 6 loyal customers and that is very disappointing to me."}
{"text":"Conveyor sushi is new to me so when I visited Scottsdale and saw they had one, I had to try it.  My standards are not high but I do know good fish when I eat it. The fish at Teharu is what is to be expected from a low end (but good) sushi restaurant.   Lots of imitation crab fills most of the rolls but I'm not too picky at this price point: it just has to be decent and fresh. The conveyor was nice, selection good and it was full and fresh; what more can you ask for?  I was expecting a big bill but was surprised at how low it was: I was stuffed and the bill came out to be the same as an all you can eat sushi place (about $24 a head) but the best part was there was no wait: you just grabbed what looked good: and most of it was good. Being from Las Vegas, I had to try the Las Vegas roll: not my favorite but it might be yours."}
{"text":"Let me first say that I came in with really low expectations.  Have had really bad sushi before. Well, I was pleasantly surprised by the freshness and taste of the sushi.  For $2.00 for nigiri sushi, the sushi was decently good.  For those of you who like rolls, think variations of the good ole California roll, mainly, and then some spicy tuna rolls and smattering of others. The sushi is freshly made, not frozen sushi that's been defrosted or prepakaged.  Skipped the fried sushi roll that was there when I got there and still there when I left.  Service was just mediocre, but didn't really matter since the conveyor belt was right in front of us.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have been here several times since my last review, and while I still like the concept and the food, the service has gone downhill.  The plusses include a drop in prices, meaning that you can definitely have your fill of sushi (a variety in fact) for under $10. Each plate is now between $1 - $2, with most plates falling in around $1.50 (red, green, and white). The last two dinners I've had here were by myself and also with a friend. The total before tip was around $6.50 and $15, respectively.  If what you want is not on the conveyor belt, you can still order from a sushi list for the same price. Definitely try the Amaebi (sweet shrimp) where they take two prawns and chop them in half. The bottom half is eaten raw and the top half with the head is deep fried in batter. Yum!  The soft-shell crab roll can be anywhere between good and awesome depending on which sushi chef puts it together. One day when we ordered this, the presentation was great (legs dangling out of one slice like spiders) and big, another day the rolls were small as if just another mini shrimp tempura roll (and no legs! the best part! ugh!).  Unfortunately, because of the drop in prices (and probably also due to this crappy economy) weekday lunch hours are SLAMMED. The last time I was here for lunch, there were only 2 waitresses attending to the whole restaurant. In the 50 minutes we were there, it took about 10 minutes to receive our waters and wasabi after sitting down and 30 minutes to pay for our food after eating. Nevermind that my water wasn't refilled at all.  I will still come here to eat because of the value and because it's actually decent sushi. However, having lunch here now is definitely out of the question unless I take a lunch around 2-3pm...or have some killer time to burn."}
{"text":"I'm living on a budget but I love sushi. This place has a genius concept, sushi is distributed on a conveyor belt. There's a bunch of varieties and they are priced based on the color of the plate they're on. It's $2 for a blue plate, $1.50 for a green plate and $1 for a yellow plate if I remember correctly. They throw in desert plates in between with cheesecake and cream puffs which is awesome. I walked out with a happy belly and only a $15 hole in the wallet."}
{"text":"We LOVE the food here and the prices are very affordable. The conveyor belt thing.....great. But PLEASE hire some more staff. We're tried to come in at many different times of the day to figure out when we might get good service. And let me say, it's not that the employees aren't trying.  It's pretty much par for the course to see 1 server during a \"slow\" time (server usually has 6-10 tables by themselves) and 2 servers, maybe 3 on a Friday night. The experience is so diminished after having great food but no refills on drinks and flagging servers down for a check. Come on management, open your eyes!"}
{"text":"Conveyor belt sushi is awesome, fun and fast. The sushi here is really good, and the prices are great. If you don't see what you want on the belt which is tough because there are always so many options cruising around, just ask and they will make it for you. Can't say enough good things about this place, it's clean, the staff is friendly and the food is great!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty decent and the price it right.  The only problem I see was with the chicken Teriyaki. Sauce was good, rice was good, BUT the chicken was BOILED ???  Their chicken teriyaki was not grilled !"}
{"text":"I came on new years day, but I did not want to stay there after seeing the long line of people. However, my friends insisted to stay for about 20 minutes. Here are my list of complaints.  1. No body was at the front at the restaurant to sign in names for the waiting list, so we had to write the names in ourselves.  2. Half the tables in the restaurant were not even being used, they should at least allow some customers to sit there, especially  if there are a lot of people waiting inside and outside the restaurant.     Because of this lack of management, we left to eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"It's fun and cheap. But not always have the best selection, depending on the luck. Also the food might not always be the freshest as well. I had slimy sushi a couple times, again, best on the luck.  Will go there if I need a quick lunch or low on sushi budget."}
{"text":"Great place! Cheap and quality! But if you go at the wrong time you might wait over 30 min before to be seated :/!!!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry I have to leave 1 star because this once was my go to spot for quick and cheap meal. So a friend and I went to eat and about 4 sushi plates in . As I go to grab for another plate off conveyer belt and grab plate a small baby roach climbs off my plate not a big roach but small baby one which means they have more. I'm disgusted my friend spits his food out I wave down server and she comes and kills roach and then says no worries we just got sprayed because or bug problem. I ask to speak to manager and manger tells me they have bad roach problem and will have them come spray again tomorrow because they just Sprayed today. What made it so bad was that it seemed so normal that they have roaches running around on the conveyer belt. I will never go back that is unhealthy and a disease waiting to happen"}
{"text":"If you're looking for cheap sushi, then come here. If you're looking for good sushi, go elsewhere. I prefer to pay a few dollars more to not have my rice taste like Minute Rice."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars because of the value and speed at this conveyor-belt sushi bar.  Who says good healthy food can't be fast? I have been here about a few dozen times and I always amazed at the small bill for the amount of food I scarfed down.  My little daughter loves it also especially with the eclectic variety of cream puffs, seaweed salad, and soy beans.  The seared albacore is sometimes dry so chase it down with some white tuna.  The Unagi sauce could use some help also, needs to be thicker and sweeter. They sometimes seem to be understaffed because it feels like have to wait a while to get my check - maybe because the food is moving in front of you and you are so tempted to grab just one more plate,, and another one,,, and another one.  If you don't see what you like, ask for a menu!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Place looked cool, so we thought we would give it a try. I love sushi and could eat it everyday but not here  nothing was great, but I guess you get what you pay for? It didn't taste fresh and they didn't really have many choices when I was there. Even the edamame were alright, how could you get those wrong? Gave it 3 stars because the place was different."}
{"text":"I have been to the tempe location and loved it. So you can imagine how excited I was for  the new  location in mesa. . After visiting several times during lunch hours I was very pleased with the service and quality of the sushi (besides the higher prices than the tempe location). But when i returned during dinner on a busy friday night I did not enjoy my experience at all. they were understaffed and overwhelmed. A crowd of about 10 people, including my family,  waited  for more than  30 minutes for tables that were open. After asking numerous times, (and being denied to sit in those open seats), we finally were seated, Ironically in the same exact seats they claimed to be unavailable.  So If you do decide to go just be aware that it does not handle crowds well.And  hopefully they can improve at this location as it is  still new."}
{"text":"I just moved here from Boston - home of fresh seafood - and was so happy to discover this sushi bar in my neighborhood.  I slipped in, was seated immediately, got exactly what I wanted with no wait, and got back out of there in 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Great sushi place for the price. Lots of unique rolls that were delicious.  Staff does a pretty good job keeping the wait to a minimum during the busy hours. Recommended if you are looking for quick sushi."}
{"text":"Cool concept but I bet some scottsdale snobs have issues  Eating here is less expensive than Chipotle and the sushi is decent.   Great concept and I think they have built up a good following of customers   Great location buy parking is somewhat limited   This is like the McDonald's of sushi.   We all know we go to McDonald's once in a while we just don't admit it   Tip:  they will prepare any roll or sashimi you want just ask....you do not have to eat from the belt ..but I bet you will just don't let anyone see you! !!"}
{"text":"A must try! Cool, low cost place, great for lunch time. I really like the tiger roll and the shaggy dog."}
{"text":"Best place ever!!!! I feel like I spend enough money here to keep it open  seriously though. Its all amazing. I go so often now they remember my daughter and ask where she is when I don't bring her. I wish they didn't close for 2 hours from 3-5 Monday-Thursday though. Maybe that'll change one day."}
{"text":"Best price in town without breaking your bank. Good selection of sushi for revolving style sushi restaurant. Prices range from $1 to $2.50 per plate."}
{"text":"Owned and operated by Koreans. Rotating sushi bar. Not very authentic.  Takes forever to seat groups.  Takes about 20 minutes to seat ppl even if there is nobody in the restaurant.  The cheesecake was still frozen when I grabbed it. If I wanted a frozen cake, I would have ordered an ice cream cake from Coldstone"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite place to go for sushi. The rotating bar is fun and usually has a good selection of different rolls. It's also nice to be able to make special orders and requests. Great staff! Antony is so friendly and personable that I've actually gone in for lunch specifically to tell him about a new job, show him a hair cut, etc..  The music selection is very modern and they do get very busy during certain hours. It's a great place to hang out or do business."}
{"text":"Ok, I went here for the first time last Friday with some people from work. We got there early to avoid too much of a crowd. The night before I had read some previous yelp reviews and the overall theme seemed to be \"Good food, poor service\". Well, I will be another to add to that. I am not a sushi fan, but there was a menu with a few other items you could get. I got the shrimp tempura with a side of rice. By the way, the menu says the rice is $1, but don't be surprised when it says $1.50 on the bill and they don't care when you ask about it. \"The price has gone up\" and pointing out that the menu is incorrect gets you nowhere. Again, very poor customer service. (For me it was the principle of the thing, not the $.50.) Anywho, shrimp was awesome. I even got some pot stickers off of the conveyor belt that were great.   Getting someone to help you can be very difficult. There was one server, who was not ours, who graciously helped us when we could not find our gal. Unfortunately, he only helped through taking our order and then we had to wait for the invisible woman to bring the food out. There were 10 of us at 2 tables of 5 each, so I usually give a little leeway, but there were tables seated after us who were getting their food before us and others that got their checks before us (which was a pain in it's own right).  Overall, would i go again? Yes, but only if I made sure I had plenty of time. The food really is that good. Just remember to put on your patience panties and suck it up. If you aren't in the mindset to deal with this nonsense, best go elsewhere that day.  Another thing of note, if your party has more than 3 people, good luck trying to sit at the bar. They will make you sit at a table. Humph. We wanted the bar. It was not in the cards."}
{"text":"This is a neat sushi place. Not the perfect great of sushi, but not so bad for the price. On the other hand, the service was horrible. I was there for lunch with couple of my coworkers...once we were seated and served our drinks, no one came around to refill our drinks or ask us if everything was ok. Our server was MIA. We had to flag a busboy to get the check for us and run our CC for payment."}
{"text":"Sudden turn for the worse. We've been coming here for several years. Tonight we got a bad tuna sashimi -- my daughter thought it had a strong off taste and when I tried it I noticed a rare combination of tough texture, rancidity and spoilage. We alerted a waitress who quietly dumped our portion without alerting the chef as we had requested. They also left the other portions on the conveyer. In other words, she didn't care if the other customers were poisoned!!! We've also noticed that the usual friendly staff seem to have been replaced. We recognized very long-time employees."}
{"text":"The Hostess doesn't speak english, can't keep track of who got there first. The food is OK, nothing special. Presentation is poor, service is sloooow, wait is long and parking is almost non existing.  3 stars for the fact that is cheap...?!"}
{"text":"Prices can't be beat! Love the revolving sushi if you want to step in for a quick lunch or go for dinner. Excellent way to be able to try multiple rolls since the plates serve smaller than traditional roll.  Every plate is under $2."}
{"text":"Favorite place to eat sushi! This is not a five star restaurant but it most def is worth the visit. Lines are always long but the food is very good considering how cheap the prices are."}
{"text":"Ok Teharu..... it took nearly 40 minutes to be seated. Had we been called as our name appeared on the sign up sheet, it would have only been about a 20 minute wait.  You can't have a guy that speaks little english in charge of seating people if he is going to skip them/ and or give away the table to another party.  This was not an impressive visit. Better luck next time."}
{"text":"I have a standing date with my boyfriend at the Teharu in Scottsdale every other Friday and we decided to bring a friend of ours to the one in Tempe because we loved ours so much and this was close to her. The two experiences were worlds apart. When we walked in, the tables half of the belt was closed and only the bar was seating, as is typical for slower hours, but there were about six other parties waiting when we walked in the door and another six or so had come in by the time we finally got seated and it wasn't until halfway through our meal (and who knows how many more incoming parties) that they finally opened the other half of the belt and began seating at the tables. I can't see any excuse or justification for a business to willingly keep half the seats in their restaurant empty when there are about 20 hungry paying customers waiting at the front. Even though we were off to a bad start, the food and service were both good. Not wonderful, but good, though not nearly as good as the Scottsdale counterpart. Three stars because the service (once we were seated) and the food were good but not good enough to make up for the fact that they were happy to allow scores of patrons to stand there for 15-20+ minutes staring at the empty tables they aren't being sat at."}
{"text":"Teharu Sushi is a neat change of pace from your standard sit down restaurant or standard sushi bar.  This place can get crowded so be prepared to wait a little bit depending on when you show up - simply add your name to the wait list if their isn't a hostess right at the door.    Teharu operates a conveyor belt where small plates full of sushi, sushi rolls, and other miscellaneous items (pudding cup anyone?) pass in front of you for your choosing.  With a conveyor belt you might be expecting top notch sushi but I would simply describe the fare as \"decent\". The prices are quite good though as you can get your fill of Sushi for $10-20.    The selection of rolls and sushi is alright - you will see a lot of the standards, nothing too exciting though.  Some of the rolls seem a little strange to me such as the ones with potato shavings, onion shavings, and the phillie roll with cream cheese and red meat...for American palates I guess.  Ultimately, you can probably find better sushi in the valley but you will also probably spend more money and won't get the fun conveyor belt experience.    Check it out at least once for yourself."}
{"text":"Great place if you want to try different kinds of sushi for a low price. Be weary since some of the sushi get left out. Don't go when it's busy its such a nightmare getting a seat or service.   I've been coming to this place for years, the west side is rarely open so seating is a bit of a hassle, and when it is open the selection of sushi is different from the main side (which has he sushi chefs right in front of them).   Still one of my favorite places to to go for lunch or dinner, i recommend the squid salad or the teharu roll"}
{"text":"Rolling belt of sushi. Lunch time each dish 1-3 dollars. Awesome! Try the baked Scallop Cali Rolls"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and great prices. The waitresses on the other hand could use some work. For instance stand around talking to each other when you have asked for water twice. Had to track one down to get my check. I think she was expecting a tip Cuz I had to actually ask for my change. Ha!"}
{"text":"Meh- indeed, This place deserves a review in-line with their prices,  2-3...  If you haven't done the whole \"revolving sushi\" thing, I recommend checking it out.  The sushi is uninspiring and resides in the ladder end of mediocrity. Long waits on the weekends/nights, coupled with few employees and an un attentive wait staff makes this place fall by the wayside in my book.   However, I will say, if your with a big group of friends who wanna get a quick sushi fix for lunch, this is an excellent option. Everyone can see what they want before they eat it, so it reduces the, \"What's that look like,\" and \"What's in that,\" questions you may come across at a more traditional sushi joint. And of course IT'S CHEAP (but cheap for a reason people so don't expect \"la crème de la crème\"). I've been back a few times with friends who haven't done revolving sush' and I will say, they're consistent in quality.  Good atmosphere, with some aesthetic appeal. The walls are littered with pictures of patrons who have created skyscrapers with empty plates of consumed fish. So if you want your picture on the wall of fame, bring your appetites. Eat well, Live well, and surround yourselves with ones who do.  - Cheers"}
{"text":"Teharu is a great place if you're craving sushi and don't want to spend much money. Their plates are super cheap, which is nice for people on a budget, like me. I usually spend $15 max on a meal, including a drink...and that's if I'm really hungry. The downside about Teharu is that the service has never been all that great, and there is usually a long wait. The sushi isn't anything too fancy, however, I generally come here for the low price. If you're looking to have a cheap sushi lunch/dinner, Teharu is the place for you."}
{"text":"Cheap sushi does not equate to good sushi! Interesting mall sushi setup, but not recommended for sushi aficionados!"}
{"text":"Be careful, this place just had 12 health violations! http://www.kpho.com/story/23042384/dirty-dining-aug-1-valley-sushi-bar-has-12-major-violations"}
{"text":"I love this place best sushi and best price. I have only been there for lunch but you better get there early cuz it is busy."}
{"text":"I've ordered in and out in and always had great service. Fun place to bring those who are sushi newbies."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I have yet to find a place that beats Teharu in terms of price to taste for sushi. The revolving sushi bar style offers plenty of variety that you can pick and choose from.  The Haru sushi is my favorite dish."}
{"text":"O.k. I've been to Teharu twice and each time had a completely different experience. We went on Memorial Day weekend and it was not busy. There was a large variety of food and sushi types rolling down the conveyor belt.  We went 2 weekends ago and completely different. It was busy and we were seated on the far end so the conveyor belt took a while to get to us.  There was little variety to be had with the sushi. Lots of water/milk/juice etc. going by.  Service is decent and the price can't be beat but a little variety with the sushi would make me come back."}
{"text":"When we first started going here it was still a little known secret, now it is out and everyone is enjoying the awesome food and ridiculously low prices. It is too crowded now, but worth the wait!!  They need to open up more locations, maybe some in the west valley."}
{"text":"I have had different sushi from all over Arizona. This was just okay if that. The waiter was wonderful. I did not like the sushi at all. I ate 3 pieces and my friend at 4 different servings."}
{"text":"Great food. Go there once awhile for dinner. Waitress look like they are always busy. Even when the place is not full. Werid"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and in the world of sushi the offerings are surprisingly not too shabby! It was fast service,  greeted immediately upon my party of 3 entered the restaurant and sat at a fine table right in the inside corner of the conveyor of delight! Prices starting at $1 per plate (I think the most expensive was $3) made out an easy process to keep the bill low.  I only had 3 plates and my bill was just under $6. The longer you sit there the more inclined you might be to add another plate. I resisted more than 3 selections and we hailed a server over for the bill.  Not a bad spot for fast sushi."}
{"text":"The PRICE! The prices here are amazing! Whenever we need a sushi fix, but don't have a lot of cash, Teharu is our definite go-to place.   The sushi is acceptable. I wouldn't describe it as \"really good\" or \"great,\" but it's definitely good enough to fulfill a sushi craving. And did I mention the price? I think you definitely get more than what you pay for here.   Because of that, you can expect it to be packed most of the time. However, I have never had to wait more than 30 minutes, and that was only because we were a large group. Other times it's been 10 minutes max.   The coolest and most novel thing about this establishment is the conveyor belt delivery. I had never seen one and I loved it! You can also order things if they are no available on the conveyor belt and they will make it for you.   One of the main reasons I don't give this place four stars instead of three (and the four-star rating would mostly be due to the prices) is because of how dirty the floors are every time we go. I understand the high foot traffic and all that, but there's a layer of grime all along the edge of the floor. Gah-ross."}
{"text":"Teharu Sushi is a neat little sushi restaurant with a twist. Like other reviewers have stated, the sushi goes around the restaurant on a conveyor belt and at a good price. Plates range from $1 to $2 and have three or four pieces on them. It was under $25 for two with a couple of Kirin beers.  The only downfall here is if you are looking for something exotic, you're not going to find it on the conveyor belt. There is a couple with a twist, but nothing too crazy. However, the rolls are much better quality over buffets and grocery store. I do recommend the Las Vegas roll.  Couple more points:  Alcohol is limited to Japanese beers and Saki. There can be a little bit of a wait on the weekend evenings. I didn't see anyone wait more than 10 minutes. Parking can be tight. Because of the prices, this place does attract families with small kids as well as groups of teens."}
{"text":"Affordable place for sushi! Excellent customer service, all around a great place! Coming from Hawaii born and raised it was scary at first to try a fish place but I must say this place does justice! People in Hawaii can only wish they get sushi at this price! Also if you have a group of people, this place is most def the place to go! CHEAP EATS!! They also provide chop stick helpers for kids but you can always request for forks! Good people, good vibes! Trust me when I say this place is GREAT!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Always fresh and tasty. Unfortunately I moved out of Scottsdale otherwise I would probably be eating there now :)"}
{"text":"As we were being seated I was greeted by a cockroach on the wall who made its way on the conveyer belt. A staff member did pursue to roach but I was unable to confirm his kill. I still decided to give this place a try and it legitimately made me feel sick and it was not my first sushi experience or anything like that. I don't know if I'm just really unlucky but non of the sushi from the conveyer belt was even kinda fresh. My recommendation is to pay a bit more and actually enjoy your food and not struggle to finish."}
{"text":"I'm in love with teharu! I've been going to this location since it opened. Always has fresh and delicious sushi!"}
{"text":"Good sushi and Kirin beer as usual.  Buzzing atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"Good, affordable sushi place to go when you're really hungry and not looking for an exquisitely tasty meal. They usually need more wait staff though."}
{"text":"Great place to get quick and affordable sushi. I wish there was more selection but you get what you pay for. Service is sometimes slow, but that's because it's always packed."}
{"text":"We werre introduced to this type of sushi place by our daughtger in Portland, OR.  Loved it there so when we found out there was a similar one near us we decided to try it.  Terharu Sushi turned out to be an excellent place and the food was fresh and served well.  This time, we only sampled the items on the conveyor.  Thanks to the folks on either side of us, we'll go for some of the specialties they suggested the next time.  We went at about 6pm on Monday and the wait wasn't bad.  By the time we finished, there were several parties waiting, but we were told that Saturday nights there are usually people wating outside.  We will go back again!"}
{"text":"Received food poisoning from eating sashimi.  Be careful!  Don't be afraid to ask if the sushi is more than 24 hours old."}
{"text":"We went here last night to get a quick meal to take home based on the great reviews.  We waited over 40 minutes and finally just went to one of the waitresses to get a refund.  No one seemed to know what was going on--my order clearly got lost and they were all unresponsive when I inquired a number of times as to the status.  When I finally said I wasn't waiting any longer their response was it really wasn't their fault.  They were always smiling--but really bad customer service.  We will never go back.  They made no effort to provide any corrective solution."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner! Just had the Cali roll and pot stickers. Overall the Sushi rolls looked very good. Our server was very nice however they only had two at the time of dinner. I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"This place used to be so good I have no idea what happened to them. There are never enough waiters or waitresses. The sushi rolls no longer resemble rolls. I am not racist in anyway shape or form but someone who is skilled in the art of making a sushi roll is of that culture and not of another culture and race entirely. I'm not sure how someone whom I heard tell a guest \"they taught me here since I'm Guatemalan and didn't know anything about Sushi\" is able to pass off as skilled."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and although I did enjoy the variety of food both times, I found the service non-existent.  On my first visit...I had to ask twice for a little dipping sauce dish as well as utensils. I also couldn't get anyone to give me a glass of water.  On my second visit, the line was out the door and people milling everywhere waiting for a table, they didn't want to open the 2nd half of the restaurant (even though that's also run on a conveyor belt).  Again, the wait staff was completely clueless and we couldn't get them to respond to any of our requests.  I do like their squid salad, bake mussels and a couple of their rolls.  Their prices are cheap and it's fun to see your food coming and just pull things off the conveyor belt as it goes by.  What kills me that the people who work there seem like they would rather be somewhere else and can't be bothered to give you the time of day.  Overall, I would def come back...but expect to be ignored anyway so I won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Conveyor belt sushi is awesome, fun and fast. The place is always busy at lunch time so you know you are getting fresh stuff. The sushi here is really good, and the prices are great. the only bad thing is there isn't a ton of parking because the strip mall is so busy."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for a while now and I say this place is a solid 3.5.  The price is right, the food is average, and the service can be quite slow at times.  To remedy this I have started going in pre-dinner rush or post lunch rush.  You can get in and out much quicker this way since they are typically real slow with refills and bringing your credit card back.  But my girlfriend keeps requesting this place so we will keep going."}
{"text":"Would give this place 3.5 stars (so I rounded up to 4). Is this the best sushi you will ever eat? Probably not, but for the prices you can't be beat it. Sushi is served conveyor belt style and based on plate color costs $2, $1.50, or $1. Total bargain and it's pretty good.  I have found if the place is busier the sushi tastes fresher. If you want to special order any of the rolls with changes, they will make it for you which is nice. My favorite rolls are the Dragon Roll and Eel Roll.  My kids love the place and the concept. They like the basic rolls, edamame and cream puffs.  Service ranges between average to good depending on how busy it is. The vibe of the place is pretty utilitarian. Overall though a fun concept and a bargain to boot!"}
{"text":"The squid salad is soooo delicious. Best I have had in a very long time."}
{"text":"Simple!  Yummy!  Good variety on the sushi conveyor belt and menu.  Some unique rolls like Haru Popper, Mountain Potato Roll, and crispy onions on top of a CA roll.  Affordable and fun!  And I could order a roll without avocado (due to my food allergy).  Good music, TV on the wall, sake and beer selection looks good.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I live for their rainbow rolls. If you've chosen your dishes wisely, your bill can come in under the $10 mark -- a great deal when it comes to sushi. If you go in the early afternoon you can usually get a table right away. Don't be afraid to try new things! I was always wary of dishes with seaweed, but now they're a staple. Always a great deal."}
{"text":"I come here once a week and the sushi is bombastic! The sushi comes on a conveyor belt and you can choose the type of sushi you want and don't have to wait for it. It's a fun atmosphere with great food."}
{"text":"Ok, so there is another teharu in Scottsdale and it is AMAZING. Literally one of my favorite places to get cheap sushi that's still delicious. So when I heard they were opening one closer to my house I was like \"score! This is gonna be great\" but, sadly, it was not. I've gone here three times at three different times of day and each time the sushi was lukewarm and the wait staff was rude. I get that you take your chances with conveyer belt sushi and sometimes a roll just isn't gonna be great because they're not busy and it's been sitting out for a while. It's a risk I'm willing to take, but at the other teharu if you ask them to make you a fresh roll they happily oblige whereas at the one at superstition springs, if you ask them for a fresh order of anything (or even for a refill!) they act like its the biggest inconvenience in the world.   On top of that, the people who work there are just straight up rude. They usually take a while to pick up the check, which is annoying but not a huge problem, except for last night when I was there with my sister and brother who has special needs. My brother got sick halfway through our meal so my sister took him out to the car and gave me her card to pay for her food. So I'm sitting there, waiving at the waitress constantly and she ignores me for about five minutes before coming over and simply responding with \"what?\" I ask her for the checks and she goes to get them. When she comes back with the checks, she hands them to me and asks \"so are they coming back or what?\" And I told her \"no, my brother just got sick so they're waiting for me in the car. I have the debit cards right here though.\" Then I go to hand her the checks back and she walks away! I watch her go up to the front and pull out her phone so I go up there and I was like \"my brother is really not feeling well so can I get these checks taken care of?\" To which she responded \"I just gave them to you. Why are you being so impatient??\" That's when I just about lost it on her :)   So...safe to say I will not be going back. I'll stick to ahi in Gilbert or make the drive to teharu Scottsdale. It's worth it."}
{"text":"I love sushi, and of course my family can't spend a hundred dollars or more every time we want sushi, so this place is perfect! The first time I went here with just my dad, we were actually concerned about how low the prices were. However, not once have I nor anyone in my family gotten sick! The fish is  fresh, the service is incredibly friendly (although they are typically very busy, so the wait might simply be long), and the food is delicious. They actually play a lot of current pop music, which I personally like, but I'm just noting it for anyone who may not like that music genre.  Incredibly low prices for pretty good sushi! Of course it isn't as high-quality as expensive sushi is, but for the price, I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"It's like eating in a dirty night club. The trance/hip-hop music is WAY too loud; you can't even hold a conversation. The staff are slow and imbeciles. The mens bathroom looks like a punk rock venue. Save yourself from coming here."}
{"text":"Very good spot. Sushi is very good and the conveyor belt system allows you to sample anything you want without waiting. Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"Place is pretty good for a conveyor sushi joint. Definitely one of the cheapest places in town but that doesn't mean it is the worst, far from it. However one suggestion to the owner(s), please make sure your employees do not bad mouth each other in front of the customers. Just because you're speaking a language (Korean) other than English  doesn't mean that some of your customers can't understand what's going on. For example i went to grab lunch today and one of the sushi chefs was clearly frustrated with one of the waitresses and was cursing in Korean. Just be more mindful that your customers can and do speak Korean.   Back to the food, considering the plates were only $1-$2 dollars a piece, i was expecting terrible quality but was surprised. I ate my fill of sushi and i only paid $11 for what was about six plates of food. I ended up getting the usual stuff such as spicy tuna roll, rainbow roll, baked scallop roll and few different types of tuna sushi pieces. The same amount would have cost me almost double for the same food at a another conveyor sushi joint.   I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I Love this place. I eat here either take in or take out at least 2 times a week!  I also agree with some of the others. I love the fact that I can try something new without committing! I love the revolving sushi. I also do not like that there are a lot of spicy selections. Why not offer the spice on the side. I would love some of the sushi, but it has that spicy sauce on it.  Some of the best to offer that some people might not know about:  Haru sushi - Tuna stuffed with crab and topped with avocado! Hand rolls - YUM!!! Some are only 2.50 Udon - Good!  The staff is great. The wait can be long on some days or eves.  Love the baked scallops. Great mussels too."}
{"text":"I don't want to come again ! garbage???????????????????????????????sushi????raman???????????????"}
{"text":"I've always had a Consistent experience at Teharu. The food is good but it definitely lacks quality. Knowing that if you're okay with it and you will have a pleasurable experience as well. The best part about to Teharu is that you are in and out very quickly and able to grab the quickest bite in town.   I highly recommend the spicy tuna hand roll"}
{"text":"Went in on a Tuesday evening by myself and did not want to sit at the Bar so I ask for a booth or a table so I could read my paper. The hostess said no I ask again and she said no. I walked out and will not go back. Went to Lush Burger instead they had a booth. The sushi is average anyway"}
{"text":"I won't ever go back. I went there at 4:30pm. It wasn't busy and there wasn't much sushi that was out, but all of it looked old. I grabbed some and couldn't even eat it. The sushi was warm. The steamed potstickers were cold. I had to leave and get sushi somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went there again for lunch.  The selection was VERY poor with huge sections of the conveyor belt being empty.  Thankfully, if you asked the chefs, they prepared whatever we wanted.  I am not sure why the selection wasn't out on the conveyor but, we still got what we wanted and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Teharu Sushi is a family-favorite. It's a great place to get \"discount sushi.\" I've been visiting here for years now and I've seen some great improvements--the music that used to blaring loud is now reduced and the overall hygiene of the restaurant has seemed to improve. The Haru poppers here are amazing and is the first thing I order every time.  The service, however, can be improved. Some servers are respectful but others barely speak or smile at you, and just don't look at all happy. Overall, I like this place a lot and the prices are great for college students."}
{"text":"I love this place! Sushi is good and super affordable! Sometimes I go in and sometimes I just order to go. My favorite is the shaggy dog and scallop roll."}
{"text":"Great place for a pretty good sushi. I really like that its on a conveyor belt too..makes eating sushi fun..The staff is always so friendly! Now that I live and work blocks away from here, this is definitely my go to place for sushi!"}
{"text":"We are delighted Teharu has opened in our neighborhood. We have eaten in twice and ordered take out once. Each time the service has been exceptional.  One server even remembered us and came over to greet us. Everyone who has waited on us here has been very friendly and personable.  As far as the food is concerned, you haven't lived until you've tried their squid salad. Some of the best we've had.  All of the rolls we've had were good. Maybe not phenomenal, but good. Their pickled ginger is the best we've tasted and we love their eel sauce.  I venture to say their prices can't be beaten. Very, very reasonable.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My husband & I arrive for lunch and the music was horrible loud.  Could not even hear each other talk.  We asked for them to turn it down. I love squid, but my last visit to Teharu made me think twice about any more visits.  I had the two pieces of squid on rice and when I took a bite, there was slim coating the piece of squid.  I touched the other piece and the same slim. It was also a little warm.  Not good.  I did not get sick, but worried about it for hours.   The place was almost empty at lunch time.  Humm, why?  I think they need to be more careful of food temp and freshness."}
{"text":"Really expected to like this place with all the positive reviews....but, didn't turn out that way. Sushi was fine. Kids teriyaki was fine. Beef teriyaki....well, my husband never did get to eat it after waiting 30 mins. We followed up a couple times and finally was told cook was busy and couldn't keep up as the owners don't let them have enough staff on to prep for dinner and make orders. Seriously sorry way to do business."}
{"text":"Great prices, selection and the sushi is on par. We needed to ask a couple times for a few things but overall a good experience for our first time"}
{"text":"What a cool and inexpensive sushi restaurant!  I love the conveyer belt and the staff was very friendly!  My wife and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, we come here often. Brought a party of 8 this time and the service was awful. Thank goodness Corrine stepped in and saved the day. Corrine was awesome. I can't say enough about her. Thank you Corrine, you saved the day! :-)"}
{"text":"Discovered the Conveyor Belt Sushi at the Scottsdale location.  We were so excited to find one a little closer to home.  Have gone here a few times.  Went again last Monday night. We are lovers of Sushi!  What I really like is the fact you can sit down and immediately start eating.  No waiting once you are seated.  BIG fan of the Conveyor Belt. The Prices are really good.  I mean really good. $1.00 to $2.00 per plate.  Rainbow rolls my husband's favorite... I LOVE the Haru Sushi. It is crab with fresh Ahi wrapped around it and a slice of avocado.  Melts in your mouth.  Yummy!!  The green Chile stuffed Poppers are to die for. Don't remember what it is called.  Don't see what you want.. Just ask and they will make it for you!  We get out of there stuffed for $20.00.  Even with a large Kirin Beer.  The staff is friendly and come around for drink orders but it is pretty much serve yourself.  It is a busy place they are constantly putting out fresh plates.  No need to be concerned on freshness.  And again they will make it fresh to order. We are fans and this has become our new favorite place for Sushi!"}
{"text":"Tried Teharu out again and this time everything was great. We received our food in little time and everything tastes great. We will be back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the greatest sushi place ever... you may want to look somewhere else. If you're looking for a place to chow on decent sushi on a tab under $15, then you've found the right place.   Teharu Sushi is a restaurant done in the classic Japanese style, where there's a conveyor belt running along the bar and most of the tables. Along the belt is a gamut of various sushi stylings. Nigiri (raw fish on rice) or rolls, gyoza (potstickers), edamame (soy beans), and other random fare (like pudding cups and Japanese soda) run their course through the restaurant, beckoning you to grab them.   And that's what you do. See something you like? Grab it off the belt, and go to town. Each plate is color coded, denoting the price (anywhere from $1-$3). This allows you to have a large sampling of many different kinds of sushi, rather than dropping $6-12 on a single large roll of sushi most other restaurants force you to do.  The sushi isn't spectacular, and runs the course of familiar rather than out of the ordinary more often than not, but the fact that you can sample multiple varieties rather than committing to just one for the same price more than makes up for it.   They also sell 22oz. bombers of either Kirin or Sapporo for $4. All day. No happy hour special, $4 for a large beer. Amazing.  For the less adventurous, they actually have a decent sized, decent priced normal menu too. My wife ended up getting the salmon teriyaki one time when we came here and was very impressed.  The conveyor belt is a bit of a novelty, but after the dozen or so times I've gone, it still hasn't worn off. It literally saves this place from being a mediocre sushi bar to being a fantastic sushi bar. Being able to have so many different kinds of sushi and a beer for under $15 is the reason why I love this place so much. Definitely check it out, you'll be hooked."}
{"text":"I like sushi. I like this place. It isn't \"gourmet\" by any means, but the sushi is good and quick. Makes for a great sushi fix. The rolls are typical, and prices are right. A great lunch stop if you are in the area. Service can be a little slow, but it is to be expected when the place is packed and busy. Don't be afraid to grab one of the wait staff if you are ready for your check."}
{"text":"The service was awful. The wait staff is terribly unorganized. We were never offered refills on our drinks, no one came by to check on us. Only saw server when we were seated and received initial drink order. People around us had been eating for a while when they finally received drinks as well. Do not eat here if you have a movie to catch. It may take some time to get your check as well. Very taxing with kids.  Food was still good."}
{"text":"Good prices, awful service. Been waiting on our check for 25 minutes now. No refills, not much food out, really don't expect much in the way of service."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I are regulars at this place and normally we love eating here, but lately they have changed their seating process and that has made it very irritating to try and eat there during our lunch hour.  They now want the guests to sign in on a sheet and put the number of your party and whether you want a table or to sit at the bar.  I followed directions on a busy Friday at 11:30am and put my name down for a table. 35 minutes went by and we started noticing people who had come in after us were being seated at tables.  We looked at the sign-in sheet again and saw that our name was the orphaned one that was NOT crossed off, they were skipping over us!  I have no idea why they did that, it was very clear that our name wasn't crossed out, but for some reason they bypassed us.  We asked the staff when we caught someone and the guy looked surprised.  He did apologize, but this upset my co-worker to the point where she no longer wanted to have lunch here and we left.  In the future we are going to call ahead and reserve a table (they must allow this because we saw a \"reserved\" sign on one of the tables today).  Get your act together Teharu, make sure your staff knows to move down the sheet and does not skip people who have been waiting!"}
{"text":"I love Teharu Sushi.    First of all, for everyone that's complaining about the service, look at your bill.  Aside from the conveyor belt bringing the yummy sushi, handrolls and appetizer gifts your way, the best thing about Teharu Sushi is the bill.  Sure, it takes a while to get a seat or table  but when you do get a seat,  it takes less time grabbing your OWN food off the converyor belt than having to sit at a high priced sushi restaurant to basically serve you the same thing only 3x's the price and wait forever as well.    Cheapest plate, $1.00, most expensive plate $2.00.  Someone tell me anywhere else  they can get a $2.00 shrimp tempura roll?    You can't go into a restaurant with prices so low and expect 5 star treatment.    I'm not saying this is the best sushi place in the world as far as quality but if you're looking for a fun time with company at an inexpensive place, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"The reviews about warm sushi and fruit flies are absolutely true. They leave old sushi out until someone gets it. I went in at 2:00pm and they didn't make or put out any fresh sushi, all that was available was what I assumed to be ungrabbed food made around 1pm. I can't be too upset about that since they do close at 3pm and they would make sushi you directly request from them. The one star review is for how they made us feel rushed to leave at 2:30pm when they close at 3."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is quite a steal for the $$!  Pros: Affordable, efficient service, decent variety, they serve alcohol, there are televisions... usually displaying sports of some sort, VERY clean, well lit, friendly staff, speedy service, great 1st date spot  Cons: Not a great place for groups as their largest table is a 4 top, they take reservations but can't actually guarantee a table due to their walk in volume, language barrier between patrons and staff  The food quality is decent. I'm a huge fan of sushi and this is not the absolute best quality but it is definitely not the worst either. I frequent Teharu 2 - 3 times a week because it is so affordable! :) I love to come here to grab a quick bite. You can seriously eat 2 rolls in 15 minutes max. If you want something that isn't on the belt, or listed on the menu they are happy to create what you want. Parking can be a nightmare as this is a really busy area, located conveniently next to the 101.   If you're looking for some affordable sushi and quick, speedy service... Teharu is your spot! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Teharu is great for people who don't have super high standards for sushi. Their sushi is good, but not exceedingly great. Ive found the quality is best around dinner time. Every time I've been to a Teharu during the afternoon the sushi is too warm and not great. The only real problem with this particular location is that around 6 it gets PACKED. Even if you're only a party of two you might be waiting between 15 and 30 minutes. But overall once you do sit down and start eating it's great."}
{"text":"Sushi is awesome and love the conveyor belt. Always great to make a reservation and avoid the line. Paying by the dish is also really helpful in figuring out how much to spend!"}
{"text":"I went in for lunch and forgot my rings there. Realized I forgot them maybe five minutes after we left so I called and they said they were holding them for me. My boyfriend showed up to pick them up and he said the lady helping him would not speak English to him, so he got flustered and took what she gave him and left.  Upon looking at what they gave him, my vintage silver spoon ring and vintage turquoise ring (all at an almost $100 value) were missing.  You'd be hard pressed to find a thief who would work fast enough to sift through my rings before the busser came and steal only the two expensive ones. I'm extremely disappointed in this business and it deeply saddens me that Teharu Sushi can stay open as a business and steal from their customers."}
{"text":"This place was not particularly appealing to me. The restaurant is clean and the conveyor belt of sushi is certainly neat, but the food here is painfully lackluster. The flavors are weak and bland; some of the food isn't even worth the bother. Furthermore, I like my sushi to be brightly colored and fresh. That is not the case here at Teharu Sushi. Come for the atmosphere, but don't bother eating."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place. Has been going there often in last four years.  Their signature haru sushi is the best.  The place is also an affordable place for students."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying the sushi is cheap but beyond that the service matched it. I became smarter than the waiter and brought my own water the second time. You can get full for $10 but don't expect anything more than that. My most recent time I had the waitress ask me half way through my roll if I was Almost done due to high demand on waiting list... let's just say if it wasn't this cheap there's no way they would be in business. Only come here if your trying to save money on sushi"}
{"text":"Despite the low-price sushi rolls offered by this revolving sushi venue the service is bad. The female owner doesn't seems to care, the chef behind the counter makes limited selection of sushi rolls. They only offers very basic selections of cut rolls. They don't really care to replenish new ones when the current ones got picked up.  It was late and we needed to find places to eat and this happened to be nearby. But if you are looking for good quality sushi please go elsewhere."}
{"text":"My wife and I love Teharu's. It is a revolving sushi bar with booths and a bar for seating. It is across the parking lot a bit on the north east corner of Priest and Ray. It's usually pretty busy, but you'll get seated fast enough. People are in and out quickly. The staff is kind but not intrusive. The sushi isn't gourmet, but it's good for the very low price. You can fill yourself up for less than 10 dollars.  If you can, sit towards the right side of the restaurant, as you enter. You'll want to be towards the bar as the items there are freshest. The left side under the TV gets last choice of the items. If you get seated there - no sweat - just flag a waiter and order something direct from the kitchen no extra charge (these direct orders are the best anyway). Recommend the Haru Poper, if you're OK with the spice. The Vegas rolls are good too (especially when fresh).  Great quick and inexpensive sushi bar. Mostly for the price I give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"The service wasn't the best. We weren't greeted at the door and once we received our drinks, the waitress didn't return unless we flagged her down. Yes, the food was pretty cheap, but just a mile away is Mido Sushi, which is cheaper and more importantly, fresh. While at Teharu, it took over five minutes to receive one California Roll! The whole conveyor belt is cheesy, especially with all the random food they add to it including applesauce, cheesecake, jell-o, and drinks you've never heard of! The Shrimp Tempura was cold when I received it and it tasted like oil. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time or money here."}
{"text":"Review update: I was a regular until I had a bad experience at night. However; that was a couple months ago. I just revisited the place around 11:00 AM for lunch and my experience was much better.   They seemed to have fired or replaced the bad staff and added fresh new people who are quick and nice to be around. They sat me down as soon as I walked in and when I asked to pay it only took 2 minutes. The food is much fresher now compared to when the old chefs still worked there and did not care much.   I might go again next month for a snack given my better experience. It is MUCH better to go during the day and not around night time.   I DO have some criticism.   1) The pop music has not changed and get's annoying after your second visit.   2) The old \"sign in\" list is really cheap. An IPad or something electronic would fit better.  3) I was let down they did not decorate for any holidays. Perhaps next year.  4) A lot of the plates, curtains and chairs need to be replaced. They are old.   The sushi is just quick food unlike a professional place. It's cheap but fills you up fast with 1/6 the price of a professional restaurant (It's more of a large sushi bar).  I hope Teharu sees this review and improves the place. They certainly have the money for it after all these people pay good money to come here."}
{"text":"Conveyor belt sushi? Yes please!   Quick, easy, good for everyone-including kids (there's pudding, cheesecake, apple juice, california rolls, etc) rolling alongside the crunch rolls, spicy yellowtail, rainbow rolls, spicy tuna, philly rolls, and tiger rolls. Rolls range in price from $1-2/plate. You can choose to sit at the sushi bar if you're solo or they also have tables that accommodate about 4-6 people. Parties over that and chances are you'll have to be split up. Every time I've been here, the sushi's been great, I've stayed away from the octopus stuff though, looks creepy. The only issue I ever had was when I snagged the steamed clams from the belt and they were cold. I think they wised up on that because I never see them anymore. You can also order special rolls on the spot. My absolute favorites are the rainbow roll, tiger roll, and crunch roll! I've been here more than a handful of times and will continue coming back to get my sushi fix!"}
{"text":"For the longest time I've had my friend Tiffany tell me all about this sushi bar called Teharu that sits right next to NYPD Pizza, at the intersection of Priest and 48th Street. It seemed like a good place for a fun dinner, and I've always been one to open up my appetite to new places, so I gave in on my friend's requests to go. Teharu was fairly close and I wasn't really going out of my way to try this new place. The location was about three or four miles away from where I live, give or take a few miles.   When we got there, the exterior of the restaurant looked very plain. With tinted windows and boring, gray letters that read \"Teharu\" across the top, I was already feeling doubt about this place before I even walked through the door. When we ventured in, it was like a slap in the face. Why? Well everything on the inside completely contradicts everything on the inside. The place was about half full, not too busy it seemed. Lots of faces were smiling and there were a lot of cheerful conversations going on through the atmosphere. In front of us was a little stand that had a sign that said \"Sign in and wait to be seated\". We were there for no longer than a minute or two before a small waitress with a huge grin came and greeted and seated us. We had seats right in front of the conveyor belt which was really exciting for me.  Right when we sat down, the waitress had already been asking for our choice of drinks and anything else we needed. Practically right in front of you, there is a chart, with different colored plates labeled with different prices ranging from 1.50 to 3.00. So right off the bat I already knew that this place wasn't expensive at all, when usual sushi bars are a bit pricey, charging almost 6 or 7 dollars a plate.  As I see each plate of sushi coming and going, I certainly didn't know where to begin. I had a few doubts, because with the plates continuously rotating until someone picks them up, you never knew how long the food was sitting there. Yet no one seemed to have a problem with it, so it must've been safe to eat! I've always been a big fan of sushi and the endless combinations of fish and vegetables so I couldn't wait any longer. The first plate I picked up was called a Spicy tuna roll. The plate was blue, so according to the chart in front of me, it was only 2 dollars. The first bite tasted exactly like how the name was, tuna and spicy. It was more delicious than what I expected it to be, so I downed the other 3 rolls right after the other. Another thing that I really loved about this place was that everything was convenient. All the sauces and napkins that you needed was already right at your table, so there was no need on asking a waiter for one. Although the workers came around and asked how we were doing often, there wouldn't be much of a problem to ask them for a thing or two. They were always right there if we had any questions or needed anything. A few conversations later I had already went through a few plates of sushi, and I had to admit I was getting very full very fast. I had another plate of Spicy Tuna rolls, along with a plate of tiger rolls, salmon rolls, california rolls, and dragon rolls. Even though the names on some of the selections were quite unusual, the taste brought it justice. There's a wide variety of selections, so even though some didn't seem appealing to me, I was sure that other customers were glad to have them. When the waitress has asked if we were ready to go, she had our check and we were out the door very quickly. I loved the employees, the food, and the environment. I will definitely be back soon, hungry for more."}
{"text":"I usually love Teharu! I went today around 3. I brought a friend with. The quality was decent, the service great as usual. However, just a short 5 hours later, we are both super sick with food poisoning. It's pretty brutal. I'm in between puking trips writing this. Please take caution if you go."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place are the prices. Sushi ranges from $1-$2. My friend ordered a soda and got it in a plastic bottle and got a glass to pour it herself (don't call it fine Japanese dining if you serve drinks in plastic bottles). I tried ordering a small beer and was told they don't have small beers so I tried ordering a large coors and was told they don't have coors either. The waiter even said \"I have no idea why it says that on the menu, we need to update our menu\" ( after 2 weeks of being open your menu is not up to date anymore?). Well my favorite part was when the desserts rolled by on the belt and there was a fruit cocktail still in the can! I had to start laughing so hard. I mean come on! The bathroom was also very dirty. there was a trail of paper towels going out into the hallway and a waitress watched me hop over them like an idiot but did not tell anyone to go clean it up. We were there for about 60-90 minutes and there were times when our glasses were empty for about 15 minutes and no one bothered to ask if we needed refills. The food was okay for the price but nothing exceptional.  It's fine to go get a quick lunch for cheap but don't expect good attentive service."}
{"text":"Love this place. We frequently stop in for lunch on the weekends. The fish is fresh. The prices reasonable. And the service is great. Thank you too for changing the music to something the adults like!! Also try the Haru Sushi when you're here. It's great!"}
{"text":"To preface this review: I am a sushi snob. It's ok. Decent service. Great for budget conscious/ college students because it's ok cheap sushi. Ok for first timers. I won't be inviting people to go with me and saying it's amazing place for sushi. I guess there are more in the valley. The one in chandler is packed all the time, I hear. This as my first to one. I was a little thrown off by the conveyor belt of food going by the tables. I thought what a great I idea for Din Sum! Wait I'm at a sushi place...huh? So I was pretty concerned about how long the sushi is sitting on the on the conveyor belt. I watched for a little and realized it's not long but no one can never be sure. I'm pretty sure I saw the same Vegas roll pass the whole entire time I was there. My voyeurism made me try a few plates. The rolls are jam packed with crab with thinly sliced fish on top. Awesome if you like crab, not awesome if you love fish. I wouldn't bother with any salmon, it was not good. It really made me think the thought, \" I really may get sick from this\".  Tuna/Toro is decent and flavorful. The rolls are pretty generic and have nothing special about them. Choose wisely and selectively. Hint for parents: keep the kids on the end of the table opposite side of conveyor belt. We spent a few extra bucks from sneaky kid grabbing plates of cream puffs off the conveyor."}
{"text":"Today salmon was sooooo gross. The salman was not as cold as the sushi should be. Kinds of very warm. We also ordered one lasvegas roll and the sushi chef gave us fucking old one so i just returned it to him. So annoying. Also their service was too slow even though there were 4 servers. They were just talking together around the counter."}
{"text":"For those that aren't familiar with it, Haru sushi is a rotating sushi bar.  Plates of half-rolls or two pieces of nigiri (the fish on rice, if I got that right), as well as drinks, desserts, edamame, and a few other things go around the bar on colored plates (color indicates the price).  Most of the plates are $1-2, some of the best sushi prices I've seen.  The sushi itself is good.  Not fantastic as far as I can tell, but not awful.  I'm no sushi nazi. If you don't see something you want, you can order it at the bar.  They've got a few beers, too.  I really like this place because I can fill up within 5 minutes of entering.  I've gone here a lot this summer, and the service was always good, and the food pretty consistent."}
{"text":"Sushi itself was not bad , but the everything else was not pleasing at all. Environment was very awkward, food was labeled but did not give descriptions of what they consisted of so you did not know what you were eating. You had to wait for specific sushi rolls to be made which took a long time considering the conveyor belt was super slow. Some were not even being made!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here many times. The food is usually pretty good but typically not fresh (unless you put in your own orders...even then they will sometimes grab what's on the conveyor belt) and the service is typically awful (with the exception of Andrew)! We have tried eating there several times just to see if it got any better, but it doesn't. We have gotten sick 3 separate times and now refuse to go back. It's clear their focus is revenue and nothing more. It's a shame as it could be a really, really great place if they didn't sacrifice quality and sanitation so much. Yes, you get a LOT of food for your money, and it typically tastes good going in your mouth, but beware you may pay for it later out the other end. Don't waste your money here, the business needs to understand that their sanitation needs a second look. I know people go just because it's cheap but it's not worth it. DON'T GO!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great service!  Sure this is no gourmet cuisine dive but you certainly get more than what you pay for. Our favorite is the baked scallop roll.  We went here for Christmas Eve dinner and left content with full bellies. They were open til 9.  For price, selection, and service-- you can't beat Teharu!"}
{"text":"It makes me sad to write this review.. I used to love coming here! Ever since I started going here the service has always been \"meh\" but that was alright because the sushi was so good and cheap. Last time I went was the straw that broke the camels back, My brother, sister and I went on a Saturday night, it was busy as usual but we didn't  mind the wait. We were seated on the second conveyer belt which had no where near as much of a selection as the main one so we ordered off the menu....15 minutes goes by, then 30, then 45, nothing. While we were waiting two different waiters came by and asked if we were waiting for our checks. When we told them we were waiting on our food they just shrugged and walked away. When some of our sushi finally did make it to our table it tasted horrible because it had been sitting out for so long! We finally gave up and got our check and left. There are other rotating  sushi places in the valley  that taste better and have better service. Hopefully they get their act together, it really used to be an amazing place :("}
{"text":"Wow Wow WOW! This was an amazing sushi bar for GREAT prices! They were quick on service and their rolls say it all in terms of presentation and taste!"}
{"text":"The service was horrid. Waited for twenty minutes to be seated when there were plenty of seats available and the waiter tried to shaft us. Once we were seated, they never came back around to refill our waters or ask if we needed anything. The sushi was stale and cold. They need new staff. Won't be going back again."}
{"text":"Teharu Sushi is a great experience.  They do not have extremely fancy rolls, that you would find at Ah-So or Kona Grill.  However, the rolls that they did have were done right and tasted so good!  I am not sure what the other reviewers are referring to, when they said all the rolls are filled with mayo.  This is our favorite and most affordable sushi spot!  We love the concept and will be back for sure! We have also been here a few different times and have never had a problem with our cards being charged for more than we wrote in the total line."}
{"text":"Teharu is fairly unique in that it's the only conveyor belt sushi restaurant that I know of in the Valley. I think there has been one in the works in Cityscape for some time, but it's been in the works for like... 1 year and a half at this point. :P So I'm not holding my breath.   For the uninitiated, this place is exactly what it sounds like- a conveyor belt sushi place. You go in, wait to be seated- if your party's not too big you'll be seated by the bar. Two rows of conveyor belts wind about in front of you, along which parades an near endless row of sushi. Mmmm. They're on color coded plates, kept hygenic with little plastic covers on top. Just reach out and take what you want! It's as simple as that. Make room to stack your plates up, because that's how they charge you.   This place is almost always somewhat busy, which I think speaks to the fact that this is a pretty decent little place. It's not the most amazing sushi, nor is it the cheapest. But it's pretty darn cost efficient, and for the price you pay you can get a lot of bang for your buck. And for those worried about freshness, the turnover is pretty good. Good enough that their tempura is still hot and crispy (not soggy), their rolls fresh, and their gyoza hot and succulent. My husband and I much prefer this place to the all-you-can-eat sushi buffet not far from this location. Mostly because for the price of one person at the all you can eat sushi we pretty much eat as much as we want at Teharu, and emerge pleasantly full. (Not like I can't eat any more sushi for a year, which is quite the statement if you know me.)   Definitely worth dropping by if you're in the area. It's not something I would go out of my way to get to, but if were in the area I try to go. I do like to joke though that it's not a good first date place. I don't know about y'all, but I wouldn't be watching my date. I'd be watching the little row of marching sushi plates, trying to catch sight of what I want to snag next!"}
{"text":"Went on 10/9/16 Sunday around 6pm. Sushi was average. But the price was outstanding. Cheapest I've ever had. Also have sake bombs. Good selection of sushi on a conveyor belt. Nice set up. Not sure how they keep track of old sushi.  Only real problem I encountered was small pesky flies. Kept having to shoo them away.  I wood definitely try it out again. Hopefully fly problem was just that day."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a long time and I love the food. The sushi is amazing and the price are great. Went there one day and there was a bunch of open seats at the bar. I was in a party of 5 but couldn't be seated since every spot that was empty was dirty. Waited for about 15 mins watching no one clean the tables. Eventually said forget this and walked out. Service is absolutely the worst I have ever seen. The place is great food wise but service wise Mcdonalds is better."}
{"text":"I think this is the best sushi place ever I like to go there for lunch all the time and honestly I thought stingray sushi was good but this place blows it off the water"}
{"text":"Great value when it comes to the sushi. The service is sub-par and the music is really annoying but if you're there just to get a quick bite of suchi this is the place."}
{"text":"What a interesting place and great with kids for easy and quick sushi.  The food actually is delivered on a conveyor belt around the restaurant.  Makes it fast.  I rate the sushi on the kind of boring side except for a few key roles.  BUT CHEAP!  Iffy if I would go back except if you need something simple especially with the kids."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Fast and great quality for your money. Gone for lunch many times and I am so n and out within 30 min FULL ......."}
{"text":"I love this place! I think the food is great and I love being able to just grab the food off of the conveyor belt. The one thing that I really enjoy is being able to come in sit down and start to eat immediately. However, that being said, it takes forever to get your check! It would be perfect for a quick lunch or dinner but if you can't get your check then what's the point? If you're not in a hurry, it's great."}
{"text":"A cool little gem in a nice area. The food was good, the prices are cheap (no comparison to some san francisco conveyor sushis place. However, the idea of a conveyor belt sushi restaurant in the heart of North Scottsdale was a wonderful idea."}
{"text":"Great food, service sucked we waited almost 20 minutes to get our check. My husband had to call the front desk from his cellphone to get someone's attention to come bring our check and still waited another 5min and finally was able to flag a waitress down to get our check and it wasn't busy so I have no clue why took so long"}
{"text":"I've had better sushi at the mall.  Service for take out was incredibly slow.  The rice in the sushi was undercooked.  To top it all off they charged an extra fee (even though we paid cash) because we didn't order over $10.00 in food.  Overall a bad experience."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Teharu is such a long time. I came in to get a quick lunch and that's what I got. I was a little worried having the previous experiences with them.   I came in an was greeted an seated as soon as I came in. I was alone this time so makes sense. My waiter was very pleasant and super happy. I came in for some sashimi so he took my order and gave it to the guys behind the bar. It took a little time to get my things but nothing to bad.   During my wait I was attended by my waiter and this other guy who was running around helping other customers. When he came by he asked if I wanted to order something since I wasn't taking anything off the belt. I told him I had an order coming and he went to check on it. I thought it was nice that they were actually checking in on me.   My food came by soon after and it was as good anything else I get here. The price was great and my waiter came to refill my drinks again and checked to see if I wanted to get anything else.  Overall I had a very nice time. The service was MUCH more pleasant and enjoyable compared to the last few times.  Only word of improvement I can offer was when I recieved my food I had like a stack of 3 plates for each order (which was 3) nine plates all over the place. Little bit of a mess. Since I ordered on one of those sheets I figured they coud have just charged me by that instead of all the plates. Although that is the norm of how they charge there so I should've have expected it."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. The Teharu roll is my favorite. Sometimes it is on the belt but most of the time you have to ask for it. No worries as they make it fast and bring it to you."}
{"text":"I love this place, best rotating sushi bar in the valley. Wonderful selection and fabulous service."}
{"text":"This is now one of my favorite sushi places. I love the variety, the price and the quick way to eat and go. Perfect for lunch! You can get good sushi for not a lot of money and so far everything I ate was delicious! I will return many times! Food is great, fun place and drinks were cold!"}
{"text":"Had sushi with my daughter and it was a fun experience, not too expenisve and the sushi was pretty good.  The conveyor belt makes it fun - just grab what you want.  The price is very reasonable, one downside is the tendancy to want to make your stack of plates as high as possible, leading to some over eating, but all in all a great place to visit."}
{"text":"This is the best place to try different sushi rolls without spending a small fortune! My son and I love going and have a hard time spending over $20 for dinner! Great prices and good food!"}
{"text":"Foods good but heaven forbid u come alone you have to wait for a single chair. Next time I lie!!! Pissed"}
{"text":"The food is really good but the service suck bad. You can be stand up front wait to order and no one will greet you  they just walk right pass you until you say something"}
{"text":"Love the conveyor belt with the sushi going round and round. Pay attention and you'll know what's been out for a while so you'll know to not pick it up..... A Mexican making sushi? I knew it would happen eventually."}
{"text":"I've been very pleased with the quality of some of the sushi here and finally I can relax about the number I'll see on the bill when going out to eat. This has been a very fun omega 3 plan you can't get at home.   The service can vary though ...after a while of regular visits they were treating us well until recently when some of those employees left. Last visit we were left dealing with the turnover and owner who clearly possess little recall for a good  customer.  If the owner is managing the tables, plan on an unbelievably long wait for your bill and not even a friendly nod for a 50% tip.  Try to have cash in the exact amount as it took 15 minutes to get our change while the owner hung around the cash register doing what, I'd could never guess."}
{"text":"Best, freshest sushi in Scottsdale.  And also, the most reasonably priced. A great place to satisfy your cravings!  The best conveyor-belt Sushi chain in Arizona. You will spend $30 here when you would pay $100 anywhere else. Those who complain about the service fail to understand that traditionally, service staff bring drinks and not the food.  Also, the food is not for picky eaters. If you take something off the belt, make sure it is something you are going to eat. If you leave uneaten food, as in Japan it is considered an insult of the worst kind to the staff. The same goes for putting things back on the belt after you've had them on your table for a while.  Teharu - A wonderful experience and an amazing find!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the revolving sushi bar. It was good sushi, reasonably priced. Our servers were friendly. The revolving bar has so many choices!! Sushi is priced $1-$3 for about 3-4 rolls. The selection is great, I tried so many new things. We also had the cheesecake @ $3. The beer is $3 or $5 (depending on size) for Japan imported. At those prices - Its like happy hour all the time!"}
{"text":"This revolving sushi bar was recommended to me by a co-worker and we will usually make a weekly lunch trip. The sushi is not the best I've had, but for the price, it's top notch!  My favorite is the Dragon roll and the steamed edamame. All of the typical American sushi plates you would expect are here and taste great! The servers are quick to serve you, albeit you may need to wave to get their attention. Overall, it's a great, cheap eat for a weekly work lunch!"}
{"text":"If you arrive during dinner rush, be prepared to wait. The word is definitely out on this place! When you put your name on the list you had better make sure you listen carefully. If they mispronounce it and you don't catch it immediately they will move right down to the next person on the list. =)  We have a few favorites and you simply cannot beat the price for the variety that this serving style allows. They also accept any special orders and make them quickly. My boyfriend always orders 2 spicy tuna handrolls and they make 'em huge!   As long as you pay attention you can be sure not to get the warm types that have already cooled. Overall, Teharu is a great little place. Anyone we've ever referred agrees!"}
{"text":"Epitome of mediocre. Environment is fun and friendly and the staff is happy and welcoming, but all that aside the food leaves much to be desired. Its fair to mention that everything is no more than two dollars but still doubling the price and quality would not offend anyone I assure you. They offer such wide selections as crab, avocado and rice, rice crab and avocado as well as avocado rice and crab. Overall a neat idea but doesnt make this place a destination, simply a place to get cheap imitation fish."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today, and loved it! It's a revolving sushi bar with a conveyer belt running different types food, dessert, and beverages around the restaurant. The most expensive plate is $2.00, and the cheapest is $1.00. Each plate of sushi is about 3 to 6 pieces depending on how big they are. It's a great way to be brave and explore different types of sushi w/out breaking the bank. The fun & casual atmosphere is sure to enhance your dining experience!"}
{"text":"I can understand why so many people like Teharu.  The place is clean and the staff is friendly.  The conveyor belt is just plain fun!  The food is inexpensive.  (Each little plate is either $2.00, $2.50 or $3.00; most are $2.00).  But, the food is also cheap.  This is the perfect place for people who think that sushi is a bunch of mayonnaise and krab (that's imitation crab, folks) rolled into rice and cut into pieces.  My colleague and I kept reaching for the tuna sashimi, because that is the only thing that wasn't fried, covered in sauce, or stuffed with the mayo krab mix.  Other items available were octopus salad (which I usually like, but this tasted distinctly like formaldehyde...for the remainder of the afternoon, BTW), caterpillar roll (eel on top of the mayonnaise roll), nigiri shrimp (big ball of rice with a flattened top of a piece of shrimp on top), philly roll (cream cheese, cucumber, and bit of tuna rolled in rice), spicy tuna roll (plain in rice), gyoza (fried pork pot stickers), and many, many, unidentifiable items covered in breading and thousand-island colored sauce.  I'm just giving you the lowdown.    We were unaware of a separate menu existing, because we were never offered one, and the conveyor belt menu is posted every few feet in the restaurant.  This was our first time here, and we kind of just had to figure things out for ourselves.  A waitress did eventually come around and ask if we'd like drinks, and she cheerily brought us refills later on, too.  So again, nice staff, clean environment, and cheap food, but it's really crappy food if you are at all educated on what you are putting in your mouth these days.  Best to warn the foodies and let the less knowledgeable have at this place."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great variety of sushi on the conveyer belt.  My kids love it too!!!"}
{"text":"We were so excited to go to Teharu Sushi as we love \"Conveyor\" sushi, and the reviews were great. Maybe we were just spoiled with Sushi Land back when we lived in Oregon, but this place is so below par we cannot imagine how it has so many good reviews. All the rolls there are tiny, I mean microscopic. It might actually be a better value to go to a normal sushi place than eat here. Since the rolls were so small and thin they had virtually no taste to them at all. I have never had to rely on soy sauce and ginger to flavor sushi so much in all my life. Each roll had so little fish, it might as well not have even had any at all.   Now before you go thinking \"Well what do you expect at $1 - $2 a plate?\" Better, much better, in fact we have experienced sushi a thousand times better at Sushi Land, another conveyor style sushi restaurant for the same prices, but with more sushi and of much better flavor and quality.   Also upon inspecting the menu, several rolls had the same ingredients, just in different order, which the same name rolls in other places we have been to had a good variety in the ingredients to them.  They were so busy when we got there that the poor waitresses were running around like chickens without heads, they had almost no time to be attentive.  They are understaffed for sure.  Lastly the women's restroom was quite dirty when we were there, and they weren't even open for more than two hours at that point.   Bottom line, very bland rolls at a price that actually makes them a rip-off. Too little fish and sub-par service (They were nice, though visibly stressed) and lack of cleanliness.  Our search for a good conveyor sushi place continues. The best sushi we have had thus far in Phoenix is Harumi Sushi, but they are not cheap."}
{"text":"Not too far from my office. Been here for lunch a few times now. All in all a pretty good spot. Quick and relatively cheap (for sushi).   They have a wide selection of items. All of which whisk by you on a conveyor belt. There are even some just plain funny items - cream puffs, jello pudding, canned fruit, etc..   Agree with some others that the service could be better. However, splitting checks is easy and I have never had a problem getting everything I asked for.   Have not been here for dinner so could be different.   The photos of tables with plates stacked up are pretty funny."}
{"text":"Great place with a nice selection of rolls. You cannot beat the price! Our family eats here at least once every two weeks. The staff is really friendly. It's very casual."}
{"text":"I went here twice this weekend for my first and second time. I went a second time because the first time we came closer to close and they didn't have much of a selection so we decided to give it another go...After reading a review from someone else saying that they had over charged her and her friends I decided to take a picture of my receipt. I shouldn't have even tipped at all because the service was terrible. The  we had to deal with three different waitress' because the one we were assigned to never came to our table and \"forgot\" to put my friends order in for Teryaki chicken.  We signed out check for $25.00...I checked my statement and they charged me $28.01. (I have posted a picture of my bill and bank statement). When I called to speak to a manager the woman acted like it was nothing. When I told her about the other review and that that was why I took the picture she said, \"yeah i don't know why this is happening so much. Maybe the can't read the machine.\" REALLY your servers are stealing from your customers and that is okay because they \"can't read the machine\"?!?! We are never going back there.   I would rather pay MORE money to an honest business than go back there and be stolen from and have terrible service."}
{"text":"Came for lunch today and there was a great variety of rolls on the conveyor belts. The conveyor belts were always filled with sushi which was very nice. The sushi wasn't anything mind blowing but for its price, it's a steal ! I recommend the dragon roll, rainbow roll, and Las Vegas roll !! It's more of a self service restaurant, but our waitress was welcoming and asked for drink refills whenever needed."}
{"text":"Perfect balance of value, quality and fun.  My girlfriend and I rarely pay more then $20 and we've paid as little as $12.  My favorites are the Haru Roll, Crab Salad rolls and Haru Poppers.  Had my last birthday dinner here (where my party broke the plate record) and had incredible fun.  Staff is friendly.  Only thing is reservations are not set-in-stone.  Bugs me but not enough to not keep coming back.  Again, quality isn't that of a Hana Japanese Eatery or Yasu Sushi but this place is so fun and cheap, I can't stay away."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch w/ my usual 'It's-Thurs-lets-do-cheap-lunch!' chicas.   Oh heaven, jars of ginger, nice sized jars of ginger...already winning points and causing me to make a mental note to myself:  must bring hubbie.  He hates having to always ask for more ginger.  Now if they would do the same w/ the wasabi......  Lots of nice choices.  Liked the squid salad, something different.  Not sure why the salads (cucumber, seaweed) are running more than the standard sushi plate, unless they are pricing it up on volume??  They have some fruit and dessert options going round on the belt.  They even had inari, my idea of Japanese dessert.    Overall sushi quality is average and enjoyable to snack on.  The prices make this place a 'must return' and do so often.  Friends made-to-order salmon handroll was $1?!?!?!"}
{"text":"A strong performance by this conveyor belt sushi joint!!! Quality is not bad, not the best but you normally don't expect the best at a conveyor belt style of sushi. These guys do a great job. The COST IS GREAT!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good, I mean it's what you pay for. The wait is long when I go but that's because it's a great place. I went in there with my friends and the service was great. Anthony, he was so funny and was on top of things. Every time we go there now we are gonna ask for him!"}
{"text":"I can never get tired of this place. I have NEVER had a bad experience. Eat what you want, as much or as little as you want. Or order something fresh off the menu. It is not the \"best\" sushi I have ever had....but it is surprisingly good and the price can't be beat! Love the sizzling salmon or order the spicy hand roll... The service is always good, fast and friendly. Its clean and usually seated quickly (they can get really busy--a clue to the quality--so peak hours can cause a small wait).  If I get bored, I simply order from the menu. You CANNOT go wrong here."}
{"text":"If you want very mediocre sushi with bad service, this is the place for you!! :):):) we had water glasses EMPTY the entire time we were there. Shouldn't have tipped at all, really. Sushi was very, very mediocre. It really wasn't worth it at all"}
{"text":"be afraid of sushi on a conveyor belt!    or not.  really, there is no reason to be.  it is good and there is decent turn-over on the rolls and fish.  there wasn't really anything we didn't like there.  oh and cheap, holy crud.  it is kinda like japan, my stomach, and my wallet had a three-way and this was the result"}
{"text":"3  just for the sushi. Sushi is always good and fresh...if only the servers were able to provide good service. I mean, they don't even have to serve food...just keep the patron's drinks full (1 refill in an hour and a half). Apparently that's too much though. But Bora sure brought the bill in a timely manner."}
{"text":"My two cousins and I went to Teharu as a last minute decision.  The plus side is that the sushi is inexpensive and it was delicious.  This restaurant serves the sushi rolls and apps conveyor belt style.  This means you are choosing various plates of sushi which are color-coded by the plates and those colors correspond to pricing.  the plates of sushi have lids on them so that (hopefully) germs are not attaching to the rolls as they roll by people in the restaurant.  One major issue that I did NOT like was that our table was not bussed throughout the evening.  We had piles of plates and lids and straws laying on the table.  I tried to pile things so that we had room to eat but I cannot stand having so much dirty things on the table while eating.  Last, as a seasoned sushi eater, I would suggest being picky about the rolls that you do choose.  I would have also appreciated more nigiri, but I don't think you are able to order sushi?  Or maybe you are but they don't tell you and they don't give you a sushi sheet.  Regardless, it was a fun last minute excursion and dinner place."}
{"text":"You don't know until you try Teharu, the wonders of sushi plates stacked to the ceiling without breaking your wallet! I highly  recommend this spot. I loved the wait staff and sushi chefs -- excellent customer service and smiles all around the room. You can tell everyone was happy!"}
{"text":"It can be cheap. It's decent sushi. It's ready when you are. This place is nothing special, but it's good for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Went on a recommendation. I'm wondering how long the unpopular dishes are allowed to revolve on the conveyor?Small prices for small portions. I ordered an Alaska hand roll off the menu. The Sushi Chef handed it to me and it looked great. Only problem is, that it wasn't squeezed tight. As soon as I got it in my hand it came apart leaving me with a sloppy mess all over the little plate. Just because the concept is volume, upping the quality and paying attention to detail would go a long way. I'm definitely on the fence about trying this again."}
{"text":"Have been to this place a few times now and i have come to a conclusion that it is more of a quick cheap date type place.  Food is not as cold as sushi should be, the service could be better and their selection needs work and they do have a sign in sheet if its busy but THEY DO NOT TELL YOU ABOUT IT so you have to already know about it. otherwise you will be standing up for a while before anyone will tell you anything. On the up side, its close by and in a good neighborhood, good music, and the plates go from 1-2 dollars, like come on where can you beat that?  quick in and out sushi place."}
{"text":"Don't come after 10pm even though they close at 10:30. They won't make you any rolls and the line is bare!! As ive been coming here recently, the quality has degraded and the service is horrible, regardless of time of day. i used to love this place but not so much anymore."}
{"text":"I'm here from Maine visiting my daughters on vacation and we were looking for a place to eat and this place was suggested by my daughters boyfriend , he said it was great but had not been here for a year or so.   We arrived at about 3;30 Nov 3 on a Sunday and waited for a seat at the rotating sushi bar , as we waited I started noticing the tacky decor and obnoxiously load music that did not fit a sushi bar at all (PLEASE TURN DOWN YOUR MUSIC) when we sat I noticed the food looked \"old\" and not much to choose from, I thought well it is 3;30 , right between lunch and dinner BUT it's Sunday and people go out to eat at all times on this day.   The rice for the sushi was clumpy and tasteless , the fish was NOT up to even my standards and I'm no way a sushi snob, It just did not taste fresh .   So I ordered the spicy Ramen noodles ($5) off the menu which said they were Korean style. If those noodle were Korean then I'm a lock for being the next President, these noodles are exactly like the top ramen noodles you buy for 10 cents in a grocery store (swear to God , don't believe me waste $5 and see for yourself) with a few chopped chives and scallions but you can make these noodles at home . Anyone  reading this should be offended by their offering of noodles and saying anything but these noodles are grocery store style noodles.  Lastly the customer service (or lack there of) I get this place is self serve but after we ordered our drinks there was absolutely none. I had a beer and was never asked if I wanted another , I know I could of asked for one myself  but after the sub-par food and store bought noodles I just wanted out , My daughters boyfriend said this place use to be way better. All I know is  they will never get my hard earned vacation money again."}
{"text":"I think it's our 60th time in here. Tonight there were three couples waiting for a table when four people walked in and were seated immediately.  We tried to ask the hostess what the policy was but she got very flustered.  As we were talking to her another group of four came in and were also seated immediately in a table that we realized had been empty since before the first couple came in!  All this while their written wait list was ignored!  FAIL!"}
{"text":"Food poisoning from not checking the temps on the fish... nasty someone come help my stomach"}
{"text":"I love the immediate availability of food.  I enjoy the quality of the food as well.  Bringing the check or a 'from the menu' dish can be a little slow sometimes, but not Abigail deal.  Overall terrific."}
{"text":"I've had a few good experiences here, but today was not one.   I took my out of town girlfriend here. We arrived at 5, and there was about 3 pieces of actual sushi going around the belt for about 30+ minutes (see picture) when I finally got the attention of the staff, asking for a water and when sushi would come out, and she wordlessly handed us a special order form. We filled out a few different types of sushi we wanted, got one, waited another 20+ minutes (watched some of the things we ordered be put on the belt but didn't grab them before they were gone cause we didn't want to double up on our orders). Finally we asked and they gave us one of the other 4 rolls we were waiting on and we decided to cut our losses and leave, sadly.  I wish I could whole-heartedly recommend this place like I would have before. The sushi is still good and good price."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night for Mothers Day.  We were not greeted to get a table for 10 minutes then after asking they did not want to serve us even though they didn't close for another 45 minutes because they didn't want to put food out on the converyer!  We went down the road to Sukana in the Frys' store area and had an excellent dinner.  We will never go back....!"}
{"text":"I think management must be non existent. The service is always terrible, as the other reviews have stayed. They will serve you a drink, but good luck getting a refill or a menu. They also play pretty vulgar music here, definitely not a family place. I listen to all types of music but that doesn't mean grandma and little Johnny need to hear Nicki Minaj's latest unedited song.  On to the food... it's decent. Not the best, but not the worst. My favorite rolls are the crunchy onion roll and jalapeño roll (this one is only served on the weekend though). I'll continue coming here as it's a great option for cheap sushi for lunch, but I wouldn't necessarily bring family or friends. I just really wish they had better service."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to bump to 4 stars, b/c we come here so dang much!  But really I can't... when you come this often, the selection starts getting stale... BRING IN SOME NEW VARIETY!"}
{"text":"By far this has been the best, most reasonable sushi restaurant we've been here in the states. The variety of sushi and the freshness was amazing! Not to mention Vegas rolls (4 pieces) for $2! Sashimi 2 pieces for $1.50 Philadelphia rolls 5 pieces $2 and the list goes on! There were three of us total in our party plus one child we all pretty much ate all we could for under $40 drinks included. Unfortunately, the setting of the restaurant is a bit crowed but we didn't care after we got our bill. Highly recommend this place, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I've been here for a couple of Friday dinners.  First of all, the wait is usually long and the waiting seating is limited, so we just waited outside.  Once we got sat on avg of 25 mins. We order drinks and start. Make sure you order everything you need because the waitstaff kind of forget about you after the initial contact.  The sushi is very mediocre, some rolls are good but are drowned in sauce. Most rolls are variants of the California roll. One saving grace for our meals was that we could order fresh nigiris from the chefs.  Overall a mediocre sushi place with cool conveyer belt concept, but not recommended if u want good sushi"}
{"text":"Woohoo conveyor belt sushi!  I used to go to a pretty good one in San Francisco back in the day, so it was nice to see another conveyor belt sushi place.  If you've never done conveyor belt sushi, you just grab things off the conveyor belt as they roll past you, and you are charged according to the color/size/shape of the plate, depending on where you go.  The sushi here is okay, but just make sure that you grab the ones that are fresh.  I usually just keep an eye on the chef and keep track of what he is preparing.  Sometimes, you'll see the same sushi rolling past you for the 100th time before the chef decides that no one wants it before taking it away, and that, my friends, is void of appeal.  Does anyone else find it hilarious when a kid's fruit cup or a ramune (a Japanese soft drink similar to sprite) roll past you on the conveyor belt in between a california roll and an alaskan roll?  3 stars just for that!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! Super cheap rolls but totally delicious. I do wish they had a larger menu but there is no place that beats these prices. I highly suggest spicy crab, asparagus and Las Vegas rolls. It can be definitely addicted and it doesn't break the bank!"}
{"text":"There are a couple \"conveyorbelt sushi\" places along the 101 - The service is better at \"the other one over on Tatum\", but the prices at Teharu can't be beat. The most expensive dishes at Teharu are only a quarter more than the cheapest stuff at \"the other place\". It's SO worth the extra drive, and the knowledge that we're not going to have our drinks refilled in a timely manner..."}
{"text":"Eeehhh. I could never go back and it wouldn't bother me. The concept is cool but the quality is just ok. I have had way better sushi elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is way on the east side of town and as such, it's not very often we make the trek that far, but so worth it in every bite. Service is terrible but is well overshadowed with the super low prices of the sushi! Delicious every time!   Please open one up on the west side soon!"}
{"text":"This sushi place was designed for me. Really affordable sushi all the time (why do rolls have to triple in price because it's not between 5-7pm). Good quality sushi. Great drink prices all the time.   My girlfriend took me here recently, again one of those places that are facebook famous for me, as in I've seen friends check in and post pics of plates stacked high but I've never gone. Our check in even got 2 comments of why we didn't invite them!   We had about 6-7 plates between ourselves and were stuffed. Also we ordered a sakibomber and for $5 (yes five dollars!) we got a large Sapporo beer and saki. Needless to say I had to give up my keys after finishing that.   Our total bill came up to about $25 with tip. I actually can't wait to come back again and you're all invited next time I promise!"}
{"text":"Teharu is a fun place to hang out with friends and try some sushi from the conveyor belt. The sushi is nothing special, but it's not bad either. I wouldn't suggest coming here if you can't get full from eating sushi. I'm usually not full after eating here, and the bill tends to rack up pretty quickly because of all the plates you get. However, if you want to try something new and like a good variety of sushi and dessert, this is a good place to try out."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a higher rating because I do enjoy it. It's not the highest quality of sushi, but it's still good in my opinion, and it's cheap. My boyfriend and I usually eat here for under $15 total, and we find ourselves stuffed with different rolls. Service is Teharu's major downfall. Every time I've gone, we get sat, get our drinks, and never talk to the waiter or waitress again.  The other night when we went, we were waiting to be sat, and there was another couple before us who specifically asked for a table instead of being sat at the bar. There was a dirty table that just needed to be bussed, and I watched two different waitresses stare at the table for a couple seconds and then just walk by. They did this like three or four times before the buss boy came out to clear it off for them. Even though it wasn't my table, I was definitely irritated for the couple ahead of us. No offense to their servers or anything, but they literally do nothing other than seat people and get drinks. The rest of the time, it seems that they're just standing around. The process of checking out seems to have changed. Before, you had to wait for a server to take your check with payment and return it to you, which could have honestly taken anywhere from 10-20 minutes. Now, once you get the check, you can go straight up to the front to close everything out. I think this is an effort to improve their speed of service, even though service is almost nonexistent anyway.  I like this place. I really do, but they need some new management for real."}
{"text":"So delicious and I spent way less than I thought I would! Such a great idea for a sushi place. The service people aren't great though, kind of rude but I'll definitely comeback because of the food and prices."}
{"text":"I've been back & have given it another try. It's still only ok but better than the 1st time I tried. For conveyor belt sushi, it's edible & inexpensive. You get what you pay for. All in all, I give it an ok."}
{"text":"Teharu is our regular sushi option.   My wife, 3 kids and I always leave happy and for a price that can't be beat for sushi.   The conveyer belt adds a bit of fun and it is nice to be able to start eating as soon as we sit down.   The biggest downside to Teharu is that everyone else likes them too, so they are always busy."}
{"text":"Got seated in decent time frame. Waiter came by and i ordered the ramen, not spicy for the baby (as I'm pointing to my toddler). Waiter is impatient Ramen comes and its spicy. I tell the lady I asked for no spice amd told her who i ordered it with. She walks off. She walks by later and i asked if the other ramen is coming soon. And she replies \"you want another one?\" Seriously. Finally another gets delivered and I'm reminded that when i order in the future, let them know if i don't want it spicy. Um. I did. The waiter that took the order comes by and tells me the same as the lady and i reminded him that i did. I'm pissed at this point and ready to leave and ask for to go container for my son's ramen. They bring me a container that is wet?! Um. Is it used and rinsed?! They said it wasn't amd they just washed it for me. What?! Ok I'm done here. And btw... so many of their dishes were going around with no covers. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Chris G. makes a good point about not arriving too early and I would say the same for arriving late. They kind of shorten the conveyor and do not replace the old stuff with fresh stuff. Our personal experience has been that the best time is generally between 6PM and 8PM. To grab fresh stuff off the belt that is.   As mentioned by other reviewers, they'll make rolls fresh for you. The other reviews are all pretty much on the money. It's definitely a fun place to go with friends and affordable. The wait staff are very friendly and accommodating. The food is a super value, great price for good quality sushi."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a fine or finer dining experience, then move along. This place keeps me coming back by being inexpensive, tasty, and FAST! I love that I can sit down, and start getting myself tasty items off the line. Plates are $1 to $3 each, so you can afford to get a lot of variety. Plates are typically 2 or 4 pieces. They are also more than happy to make something for you if nothing on the belt tempts your fancy. WARNING: The longer you sit there the more inclined you might be to add another plate."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Piece of wire in sushi. Warm old stale sushi. Hoping I don't get sick. Service was not friendly. Bathroom full of black mold. Just getting sick thinking about it. Do NOT eat here."}
{"text":"Super fresh and lots of variety!  Reasonably priced as well!  It was fun to eat a little of everything.  I was there about an hour and new items were constantly being passed down the belt!  Squid salad, Seaweed salad, Cucumber salad with crab,  tons of tuna varieties, ebi, dragon rolls, appetizers and dessert items!  From appetizers, salads, desserts to nigiri, sashimi and rolls! You will not be bored.  I really loved the Hari Popa, a jalapeno popper, sushi hybrid!  Stack those plates high and it will not hurt your wallet!  Not the best Sushi I've had in my life, but very solid and better than most Sushi in AZ.  Service could be better, but you don't have to wait to eat, just grab a plate!"}
{"text":"The sushi is good, especially for the prices. Otherwise the customer service sucks. Servers don't wait tables, the point to a table and tell you to go sit over there. The one server sat and stared rudely at my table."}
{"text":"Service is terrible but the sushi is delicious and cheap. If you sit towards the left you get ignored and there is no good sushi rolls left by the time it gets to you so it makes the most sense just to order."}
{"text":"Love Teharu overall. It's not the fanciest sushi ever, but the fish is fresh, delicious and (for lack of better words), cheap! We love dropping in here for a week-day date and a meal we don't have to feel guilty about later.  The staff is always extremely friendly. I'd only change a few things: A) please change the Muzak station once in a while -- I hear Gyote in my mind everytime I look at a sushi roll B) if there are tables open, seat customers instead of sectioning them off -- it's really irritating to have to wait twenty minutes when five or more tables are open C) continue making fresh rolls after seven o'clock; the selection gets limited and fishier as the night goes on."}
{"text":"We have been here three times. Excellent service and very friendly staff every time. Uni always available which all uni lovers know a lot of places are either sold out or don't have any. Prices are incredibly affordable. Sushi is good quality! We love Teharu! If you like sake, try the pink bottle! Yumm!!"}
{"text":"Teharu Sushi is more like TERRIBLE Sushi, it's just plain terrible.  Either they brought back the show Punked or their filming Kitchen Nightmares and I just don't know about. Mr. Chef Gordon Ramsey, you can come out now.   I've always liked the idea of sushi plates rotating on a conveyor belt allowing you to pick and choose but when the sushi on the belt looks older than Betty White and smells as bad as vomit, it's the first sign to run. However, with a starving party of 14, I was overuled on leaving, so we stayed.  Not want to risk getting bubbleguts or worse food poisoning especially while on vacation, I sat back and watched the made for reality episode unfold.   8:00pm: Our large party is seated 8:15pm: Drink + kitchen orders are placed 8:20pm: The sounds of glass shattering and plates hitting the floor get the entire restaurants attention, one of the waiters has dropped a full tray of plates and dishes. 8:40pm: 25 min after placing drink + kitchen order, waiter heads our direction walking over the \" wet floor area \" I see a bowl of miso soup and rice flying in the air. There goes an additional 25 min. of waiting some more. 8:50pm Sushi chef making baked mussels scrathes his scalp and continues preparing the food. I guess their secret sauce must include dandruff.  9:00pm The drinks + kitchen items are delivered but the teriyaki beef is missing. The server goes to check. 9:10pm: First the dandruff and now there's a fish bone found in the miso soup. Really? 9:20pm: Everyone at the table is miserable and complaining about the food.  9:25pm: 20 minutes later, we ask for an update about the Teriyaki beef. The waiter goes back to the kitchen again. 9:35pm: The server returns with a BS answer. The kitchen never recv'd the order because of recent issues with the wi-fi which caused a system glitch. It might have been believeable had it not been for the waiter who originally took the order overheard laughing that he forgot to place the order. 9:50pm: The kitchen order is delivered as soon as were about to leave, almost 2 hours later. I ask if the manager will comp the $6.00 dish and the server returns with the Manager says \" No, you get your food and you must pay for it. \"  9:51pm: I'm still contemplating who to Hadouken (refer to Street Fighter )  9:52pm: What a waste of life, we pay the bill and leave.   Anything that could have possibly gone wrong, went wrong. One of the worst dining experiences ever. Disgusting sushi, a unsanitary chef and horrendous service, Teharu Sushi is only worthy of 1 star. This place is a joke."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times, still one of the best revolving sushi around town. This place is usually busy but if you get there just before it opens than you will be seated right away.  The atmosphere is pretty good, prices cheap, food is good, and service is good. When coming in the restaurant is pretty big, probably too big for the actual used space. They have one main rotating sushi bar where everyone sits around and grabs things off the conveyer. That only takes up half the room; the other half isn't really used since most people want to sit near the conveyer. I believe they should do a remodel to kind of utilize that unused space; this way they can add more larger tables on both sides for bigger parties while getting the benefit of the conveyer.  Food there tastes a whole lot better than other revolving sushi I've tried, and they keep adding other selections to their menu. I definitely recommend getting the Haru sushi, and if it isn't on the belt then order it from the waitress.  Portion of each dish ranges from 2-4 pieces depending on which thing you get. Price per dish is reasonable ranging from $1-3 dollars. I could easily rack up a $15-20 dollar bill on my own if I don't pace myself.  Service here is generally good, once they seat you and ask if you want anything to drink, they pretty much leave you alone. I suppose that could be a good or a bad thing depending on how people view it. I personally like to be left alone while I'm eating. I think it's nice that they leave you alone here to eat, but they need a little improvement; there have been times where I've had to flag down the waitress to get in an order or get our check.  Overall, I will continue to go back here anytime I have the craving for some cheap sushi."}
{"text":"I was thrilled when I found an inexpensive sushi restaurant in North Scottsdale. But every return trip kept getting worse. The sushi is subpar, the ambiance is ruined by the blaring music, fruit flies are always present, and the service is incredibly slow. My trip tonight also featured no refill of my water for the hour I was there, saki that took 20 minutes to arrive, was cold, and obviously watered down, plus the added distraction of listening to the hostess loudly argue with local law enforcement. I won't be returning and I caution everyone reading this to find someplace else to dine. You'll know this is the place I warned you about when you see the staff members out front chain smoking."}
{"text":"Is it the best sushi, no. But it's good, cheap and you can try different things without breaking the bank. Nothing wrong with that. Plus fun, different concept."}
{"text":"This was my second experience with Sushi in about 8 years.  (I am a bit timid with fish)  I loved it. I met some friends there and we had so much fun choosing what we wanted and sharing tastes.  There were 6 of us and we ate til we were full for $8 with tip and tax.  Everything was great.   The fun part is watching the sushi plates go by on this conveyor belt.  There are so many types that you have to really do a good surbey unless you know exactly what you like.  Service is great and it's all fresh!!"}
{"text":"My 5yrolds favorite place to eat. He's always finds something he enjoys to eat and is entertaining while doing so. Very affordable as well. I guess affordable isn't good when it comes to sushi and skydiving, but this place is good."}
{"text":"Been here for 5 years, at least once a month, lines are getting longer, but thats because prices are getting cheaper, but the sushi is always consistently good and its always a fun and cheap experience. It's not cuisine food but it kills the sushi craving and also I've never gotten sick!! I think I've recruited 20 new friends to this place =)  CONS-I wouldn't eat the mussels or octopus here, I dunno about its quality, but it just tastes \"fishier\" to me than finer sushi restaurants..."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Service was fine. Food was less than mediocre.  Chef In back did not wear gloves when stuffing peppers a d wiping face then stuffing peppers. Bathroom smelled like sewer. Sewer drain partially open and in hall, water was coming out of wall."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the cheapest places you can get sushi around. Okay- that sounds awful. Cheap, in this case, doesn't mean low quality. I frequent Raw and Sushi101 and the quality is definitely comparable. Special secret: ask for the hand roll menu if you're not into the whole revolving sushi bar thing. Personally, I love their Vegas rolls and Rainbow rolls. Crunch roll is always a safe option as well! Super casual- Pop music usually playing and almost always packed for dinner. Definitely get here before 5 if you're not one to wait.   Only downfall- slow turnover, which contributes significantly to the wait. Not recently but a couple of years ago, I remember waiting over 45 minutes to get the check however, it seems to be improving. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I've been looking for a cheap, good sushi place in Arizona for the past 2 years I've lived here. Coming from Los Angeles with places like Sushi Mac and other inexpensive but yummy choices, I was a bit spoiled.   Now I'm even more spoiled! The most expensive plate here is $2! I never even found prices that cheap in L.A. where you have sushi places on just about every other corner. Plus, this place is good! Sure, its no fine dining establishment so the quality is not top-of-the-line, but its BY FAR much, much better than store bought sushi, and again, cheaper.  I recommend this place to anyone who, like me, loves sushi but doesn't want to break the bank."}
{"text":"To get seated here you sign in on a paper with your name and group size. While waiting for around half an hour they took multiple groups the same size as ours (3) before us and another group our size. After flagging down a waitress to ask why we got skipped over on the sign in sheet she yelled at the other waitress to take us to a table that had already been ready for a while. No idea why we were just skipped over, there weren't any reservations in the other groups and they just jumped right over our name on the paper. Seems like they prepared a table and just forgot about us.  Speaking of \"forgot about us\", we had to flag down a waitress that actually get our check. I don't mind waiting for someone to get to me but the staff was nowhere to be seen.   The food tasted ok, however, I did vomit a few hours after eating here (Update: had continued signs of food poisoning a few days after as well). I have no way of knowing if it was the food here 100% so I won't knock a star off for that, but just be aware I did get sick shortly within the reasonable window to be related to food (3-4 hours later). I also did see the fruit flies that were mentioned in the other reviews. Out of my group I was the only one to get sick, however I was one of the the only ones to eat the raw salmon and tuna sushi. Took a look at their last health inspection online and it turns out they got cited for improper thawing and handling of tuna so I'm thinking that might be it.   Bottom line is you get what you pay for. With the most expensive sushi dish being $2.50, top quality can't be expected. The conveyor belt is a novelty that takes around 15-20 minutes to make a full circuit so if you're near the end of the line everything is a bit warm."}
{"text":"I  this place. The food is good the prices are great and the service is exceptional. I have been coming to Teharu for the past 6 years. For those of you that have known Teharu my picture was in there wall quiet a few times."}
{"text":"Our favorite Japanese restaurant in AZ! Sue always treats us like family and we love to see her too. The sushi is priced so well and the quality is wonderful! Such a great place to check out and it's worth the wait. Please tip your staff well! They deserve it!"}
{"text":"Find this place on Yelp and saw they got good reviews so decided to give them a try (was planning on going to Sushi Station). Don't know what all the fuse was about but they were not good. Space was too small and not alot of options. When ordering sushi they forgot one of my orders and the waitress kept asking me if i ordered it. I said yes...finally it came out. First time and will be the last time. Was not good. Next time sticking with my regular spot at Sushi Station."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! You really can't beat the fun atmosphere of the rotating sushi bar. The food here is pretty good and they will cater to any special roll requests people have and the staff is overall very friendly. Definitely a favorite hangout for my boyfriend and I if on the east side."}
{"text":"I had never been to a conveyor belt sushi place until just a couple nights ago.  This place is literally within walking distance from my home and I am so glad I found it.  The sushi is totally affordable, yellow plates are $1, green, $1.50 and blue $2.  I stuck to the nigiri, personally which all ranged from $1.50-$2.00.  Their rolls were good, especially the Vegas roll but I found that their other rolls were too similar to each other and lacking variety.  I will definitely be back here and if you are ever in the mood for some quick, affordable sushi but don't want to break the bank, Teharu is your go to place!"}
{"text":"When I normally go out for sushi, it's an expensive evening. I cannot resist toro when it's featured, and I am willing to give a standing ovation when I get real wasabi from a sharkskin grater. If this is the experience you're looking for, don't pick Teharu  If you're looking for a good value sushi joint that is roll-centric, Teharu is the place to go.  I really enjoyed the endless procession of colored plates moving around the sushi bar on a conveyor belt. The plate colors reflect the price of the dish: $1, $1.50 or $2. All in, my companion and I ate until satisfied and our tab was about $22.  The options that rolled past were pretty standard. If there's something you're really interested in, the sushi chefs can make special requests. I had a spicy tuna hand roll that was good.  As far as beverages go, their iced green tea hit the spot on a hot Phoenix day.  In summary, Teharu is a very good value. Come here if you want sushi on the cheap. If you're looking for a more upscale restaurant, I'd recommend Hiro on 90th street."}
{"text":"Love this place! We make the trip from west Phoenix when we're feeling froggy. Cheap,delicious,fresh and I love the revolving sushi bar. We get seated quickly and my glass is always full. We eat like Kings for under $20! Highly recommended. I wish they had one on our side of town."}
{"text":"The sushi is ok and the prices are great. But the service is absolutely horrible. I have gone there many times and each time the waiter always forgets something or just neglects us entirely. The most recent time that I went we walked in and they showed us to our table and just left without giving us wasabi or asking for drinks. Th same waiter then went and sat another family down and got them their drinks, ignoring us when we asked to have our drinks. Finally she came back around and we got to order out drinks. But then she went and forgot about it until we asked again. By the time that we were done eating and ready to leave she came around with the drinks. This was the worst service I have ever received and I will not be going there again."}
{"text":"Teharu is defiantly a different way to experience sushi in the valley that will keep you coming back! The Sushi is ok, its not bad by any means but it is not special either, but Teharu makes up in the price and in the service! Last time i went for 2 people the bill was under $20 (without tip) and we were both full to the brim! Other Sushi places i can spend $20 bucks easy on my self! The atmosphere of the Teharu is very cool, being able to pick and choose what you want when it rolls right by you makes it really fun! i defiantly recommend Teharu to anyone that enjoys Sushi!"}
{"text":"I was first introduce to this place almost over 5 years ago and it started out great but I think I might have to break up with Teharu.   I'm more interested in the food so I'll start with that. I always get my usual when I go here and it's always Hawaiian, Vegas, Dragon, and Bake scallop. Now I live in East Mesa so it is a good 30 minutes drive to get here and let me tell you, it used to be worth it. The last 5 times I've been here has been a miss. Vegas roll was always cold, kind of defeat the whole purpose of having a deep fried roll? No? The Hawaiian roll, which is spicy tuna roll with tuna on top and spicy mayo is always unbearably spicy because I think they are trying to mask away fishy flavour since their fish isn't the greatest of quality, which I knew for the price wasn't going to be the greatest already so when it's extremely spicy, then i can't eat it so...?  Now what annoys me is the bake scallop because that was my absolute favorite but lately it's always been disgusting. Like it has a pee smell on the scallop so when you eat it, you feel like your eating someone's piss.   I never get to try new rolls anymore because the ones on the belt most of the time looks dried and like it's been there since they opened up for the day. And there's usually 1 left, what's so hard about replenishing it? Or do they wait for that one customer who just eats anything to eat it before they put out more? That's another thing that erks me, if you're a conveyer belt sushi, shouldn't you have someone dedicated to constantly stock the belt with a variety of sushi so that customers can grab? Lately it seems that they focus on orders more and then the belt becomes empty and sad.  When can the price of something stop being accountable for the quality you get? Yeah it's cheap but when can we stop saying, oh for the price it's not bad. And this is why restaurants continue to lack and not improve.   Oh and for the waiters and waitresses there, I'm not even going to waste my time writing about them because the don't bother wasting their time serving me.   So long story short. Try it for the experience but don't expect much cause you know, for the price and all.... ( last part was sarcasm if you didn't catch it )"}
{"text":"Not sure how I should start this review.  I have been here plenty of times because it's very close to my house and the price is cheap but the quality of food and service is a hit or miss.   I keep returning even though it's not the greatest sometimes because of the concept. I just love how you can eat a variety of rolls at one sitting. Sure I can go to better sushi restaurant and pay 10+ for a roll but then I am full after a roll or two so I won't be able to eat a variety of flavors. I don't know about you guys but I'm Asian and HATE wasting food so there's my dilemma. And hence why I keep coming back here.   Some days I come and the sushi is on point.   Some days I come and wonder if it's even sushi they are serving.   I am not going to even talk about the service because most of the time it's non-existent.   You should definitely try this place at least once because why not? It might be a good day and hopefully you'll get delicious sushi at a cheap price."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about a month damn near everyday now.  Best time to come is the lunch rush when everything is fresh. Chefs will make you hand rolls and sashimi per request.  Fish is great quality but the cuts of nigri are small to save cost.  Try and avoid all rolls with crab mix. This place is a real nigri heaven as most places are 8 bucks just for two pieces. Service is decent, I feel they are a little short staffed but they take care of you in a decent amount of time."}
{"text":"Used to be a decent place, unfortunately it's gone down hill a lot. The one thing that I cannot understand is that they have TWO conveyer belts, but they only ever open one of them, so you're guaranteed to be waiting at least 30 min every time you come here. To me, it's not worth the wait. It's cheap sushi sure, but you get what you pay for, find another cheap sushi place for less of a wait. I don't recommend this place to anyone anymore."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, lots of fun to pick your food off a conveyor belt. You just keep eating and are pleasantly surprised by the low bill at meal's end."}
{"text":"Never thought I would be a fan of a conveyer belt sushi bar....you know, the fear of watching the same rolls go around and around and wondering how many hours it's been sitting there? Teharu is always busy so I dropped that fear as soon as I walked in the door! This place rocks my socks off! The restaurant is small, so get there early or go on a weekend for lunch if you don't want to wait for a table... however, my motto: if there is a line or a wait, it must be good!... and it was!  Our waiter was very friendly and so were all the sushi chefs. My hubby asked for a specific roll and they made it for him on the spot! The sushi is all really fresh and they make a bunch of different rolls and other things as well. It was a fun time and I can't wait to go back! My hubby and I had a tall stack of plates (I think we tried almost everything... prolly not but it seemed like it) and the whole bill was under $20!!!!"}
{"text":"Good, solid sushi. Nothing that is really over the top,, but what is there is very good.  The food comes around on a conveyor belt so it is easy to sit down and just dig right in.  Warning though, you can easily over do it.  I thought they were going to have to roll me out.  Price is great.  Two of us going to town still only ran up a $50 tab."}
{"text":"Service sucks! Maybe they need another person around 12pm because they were so many dirty tables when we arrived and had to wait 15 mins to be seated. I ordered tempura shrimp and that took 20 minutes. I think they forgot to put in that order that's why it took forever. The servers talk to each other the entire time when they can get tables/bar cleaned up. This place was better when it opened now it's trash. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I truly enjoy this place.  I have been here many times, and I enjoy the sushi, the novelty of conveyor belt dining, and the wonderful people who work there.  I appreciate that the plates are not too expensive, it allows me to try new things without the guilt of wasting money, but I have liked almost everything I have tried here.  It is sometimes difficult to get a seat because it can get very busy here but once you do get a seat you can start eating in seconds. You can also order food plates instead of waiting for them to come around, depending on where you sit you can miss out on your favs. Great place to go before a movie! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Average sushi. It's not bad, but definitely not the best I've had in the Phoenix Metro area. Prices are reasonable and they do keep the rotation pretty fresh. In addition to sushi they also put pudding cups and fruit cocktail into the rotation, which confuses me as I don't come to sushi bars to eat pudding. :P I've never seen anyone take any of the pudding or fruit cups off the belt.   It gets super crowded at lunch, and slow, so if you're in a hurry this isn't a good place to go. The last time I came here for lunch the wait was long, and crowded, and for some reason they only had the sushi bar open had the dining room closed off, even though the conveyor belt hits every booth in the place. There were a few groups of people  waiting, and they could have been seated at the booths, so the sushi bar would have been freed up for everyone else. Service is a bit slow, but they are polite and cheerful.   I haven't been here in awhile, so I plan on going again to see if anything has improved."}
{"text":"Finally went to check this place out. :) Do NOT judge this place by the Teharu in Tempe! It's much cleaner, much more organized, has better customer service, and has much better sushi.   Service is OUTSTANDING. They are attentive. If you are unsure or indecisive they ask what you like to eat, and recommend sushi options based on your personal preferences. If they see that you haven't taken something from the belt in awhile they ask if you'd like something ordered directly from the bar.   My boyfriend ordered the ramen, which was amazing. Nice, rich broth with chewy noodles, and just the right amount of heat. The egg was cooked perfectly. He really enjoyed it.   I had a few bites of his ramen, but chose to dig into the sushi. You won't find random pudding cups and fruit cocktail on this Teharu's conveyor belt. Besides the sushi, they have a small dessert selection of cheesecake and cream puffs, as well as bottles of Ramune.   My favorites so far include the Sizzling Salmon roll, the Haru roll and the lobster roll. The nigiri is nice and fresh. The Las Vegas roll was not my favorite, I found it to be quite bland, so I'll be skipping that one next time I come in. Things I want to try: haru poppers(those disappeared pretty much as soon as they were placed on the belt), and the baked scallop roll.   Did I mention the great prices? Most of the plates are around $2, so if you're on a budget and craving sushi this is a good place to eat.   We've found that most of the good stuff gets put on the belt at about 6:30 PM, which the dinner rush gets going. :)   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Holy Sushi!!  A revolving never ending assortment of sushi, drinks and dessert - I'm in!!  The sushi is great and the prices are great, everything costing no more then $3. Only complaint would have to be lack of a variety of items to try, but other than that friendly service and an Awesome experience."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to eat! It's quick, cheap, great atmosphere - really what else can you ask for?!"}
{"text":"My cousin and I went maybe a month back.   Man I feel like I had my first sushi experience all over again. My first experience I got some foul smelling fish and food poisoning. I swore to never eat sushi again but I've had many in between a that wowed me.   The price is cheap. The place was pretty much empty but the sushi was old and had no variety. I was hoping it would ramp up because we came just before lunch. But the place stayed dead and no new food came out. We reluctantly tried many dishes but still  we were left with the same feelings I got when mom made me eat Brussel sprouts.(no offense to anyone who likes them)  So yeah my friends- conveyer belt sushi is not in."}
{"text":"Asparagus sushi, get in my belly!  I am in love with this fun little sushi bar. For a few small bills, I can stuff my face with half a dozen types of sushi and polish it off with some cream puffs.  The sushi is very delish too. Although, I would avoid it during the dinner hours on weekends, as the place gets super busy, and the sushi isn't nearly as good."}
{"text":"OH I LOVE TEHARU!  Its a conveyor Sushi place the food comes to you! I always go there on their off peak times and service is great!   For two people we can get gut busting stuffed for 25$"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me Teharu has opened down the block from me. Did someone plan to make me go broke or something? This place has plates no more than 2 bucks a pop and the variety on the conveyor belt is great! My favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"I knew what I was getting into- a self-serve sushi bar with cheap cheap prices. We got 8 blue plates, which was about ~4 rolls worth. We paid $17. At all the other sushi joints nearby wanted just that for one basic roll. I was very happy with the quality and freshness of the rolls. They added new things each go around. Win for me!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times already and it's been great every single time. The sushi circulates on a conveyor belt which is pretty fun. If you want to try a variety of affordable and decent tasting sushi, then you should definitely make a trip here. The last time I went, I spent around 11 bucks and got to try many types of sushi. I will be back if I'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"The sushi is always good. I really like it compared to other fast sushi places. The quality and prices are also not bad, only because you can't really walk out of a sushi restaurant for less than $100 these days. But this place is not that expensive at all. The only horrible thing is if you get a bad waiter. I have been there a few times and got this male waiter young kid and he is horrible, maybe they keep him there because it's a family restaurant and he is family!!??? The only time he came to our table is to ask us what we want to drink and brought us our drinks... that was it!!! I kept trying to fish him down but it was ridiculous... only ended up having to ask other waitresses there for help... mmm yeah NO TIP for him. If you ever go make sure you don't get him..."}
{"text":"I don't recommend this place unless you are sitting right at the main revolver with the chefs. The sashimi pieces here are dried. The price is good, but the distribution of the sushi plates on the revolver is the major problem here. Nobody bother to put the freshly done rolls on the far end of the revolver. I will not come back since this one is the worse out of all the restaurants I have tried."}
{"text":"I've still yet to eat there, but I pickup twice a week pretty much since they opened. Sushi is always good, service is always friendly, and I could stuff my face for $15. Keep on keepin on Teeharu"}
{"text":"For the price this place is awesome! Only setback is I wish there were a bigger selection"}
{"text":"There is another location on Chandler Blvd and Ray Road and I have to say this location is better. There is the possibility the day and time of day makes the difference, but at this location the food seemed much fresher.  For example, the gyoza was warmer. Either way this small chain is very enjoyable for the price."}
{"text":"Don't bag their waiting list. If you come during peak hours - expect to wait... That goes for almost ALL great restaurants that don't use reservations (us savvy Yelpers should understand that). On to the food: Don't expect Roka Akor on a conveyor belt! That being said, expect great sushi at an unbeatable price. If I could rank on Value alone, Teharu would get 6 of my Yelp stars. Bring a fun friend or two, be accomodating with your schedule, and laugh about the random v8 juice & snack packs that come around the belt along with the sushi. I have enjoyed every one of my dozen + visits. It is absolutely a \"must-see\" if you're a sushi fan."}
{"text":"I used to go to the Chandler location a lot but after a while I stopped going... the quality seemed to go don't at that location... but I was still excited to try this new location.  For some reason, everytime I go there, the place is empty... but that's not necessarily a bad thing (less wait time yassssss)   Love the fact that I can try different types of rolls but not have to eat 8 pieces of it...and its really fun watching the sushi move a long the belt  My faves include the Vegas Roll, \"boobie roll\" not sure what it is called for real lol but it's the one with the red dot, And the Rainbow roll! Yummy!!  You can order more specialized stuff on the menu but may not be on the belt.  For dessert there's random cheesecakes and cream puffs that go around and other drinks as well ( I personalky focus onthe sushi)  Anyways... Prices are pretty affordable from 1-2 dollars per plate... But it does add up!  Go and try anyways! It's fun and yummy :)"}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to this sushi spot. Rarely have a long wait, and once seated it's so much fun to grab the sushi as it goes by on the conveyor belt. Each plate color means $2,$3,$1 per plate. Tip: I order the jalepano poppers if I don't see the on the belt...they are awesome! Fun spot, not expensive and tasty sushi."}
{"text":"Plenty of parking here. They don't take reservations, and due to it's popularity expect a wait time to be seated. Definitely a place if you're looking for affordable sushi. I favor the Crab, Tiger, and Haru Popper rolls."}
{"text":"REALLY GOOD AND QUICK SUSHI!   this is not fancy sushi but it is really good, fast, and fresh.  If you don't see what you want on the conveyor belt, you can order off the menu.  The spicy ramen soup is really good too, they also have cooked dishes like teriyaki chicken, etc. Gyoza dumplings, hawaiin roll, haru poppers, haru roll, spicy tuna roll are some of my favs."}
{"text":"Decent food but they close down half the restaurant at random times for no reason and let customers wait for 20-40 minutes just for a table. Ridiculous. I've never in my life seen a restaurant that does this. I used to love coming here but their service and wait staff are really rude and not interested in making customers happy anymore. They're more concerned with taking their break at 3-5pm. Good luck with that."}
{"text":"This is a sushi on a rotating belt place. Just pick what you want and pay by the plate. The sushi was ok, you get what you pay for. I liked how clean it was and the service was great. What I could see an improvement on is the amount of cream cheese and california rolls were on the belt (fewer the better). But again you get what you pay for. If I want a cheap sushi fix I would definately go again."}
{"text":"The girl next to me just got 5 plates of sushi at 4 pieces each and it was less that $10. Holy crap!!!! And the fact she could eat that much!! I ordered a specialty roll and they wanted to charge me double--i offered to pay more since double was $5...fish is pretty good!! Tastes fresh considering we're land locked"}
{"text":"Stopped in Sunday afternoon with a 3 person group there was a few other tables. Place is nice. The revolving belt is a super cool concept but the food was disappointing. Nothing was good. Not even the frozen slice of cheesecake. But it was cheap. $20 for 3 ppl.   It's worth a try."}
{"text":"You pay for what you get. It's a chill place to go grab a quick lunch with a friend or something fun for a group.  Not all that great customer service. Waters hardly get filled, last experience was a disaster. We asked for water and the asian lady gave us an attitude, ran off, came back, and threw a bottled water on our table and left. We weren't pleased. We noticed she had short patience with everyone she was seating. How does she still have her job? I'm not sure. They have a no management policy, that explains it all.   They aren't a top notch \"sushi place\" as some people have said and they don't pretend to be so I'm not sure why anyone would hold high expectations for a place of its kind.   Just keep in mind of the violations they have and take a look at the most current update on the Maricopa site."}
{"text":"Service is very hit and miss here (hence the reason for only 3 stars, because service is important to me)...sometimes the service is attentive, you get drink refills without having to flag them down....sometimes they actually fill the special request (rare).....sometimes they stop and ask how you're doing....and sometimes...not.  Special requests are not that they do something unusual....just that I want Goyza or I want the Teharu tuna and it hasn't come around, so I ask for it.   Sometimes I get it, sometimes they never return.    Food has always been good, which is what keeps us coming back.   Wish they could refill things faster, but we have figured out where to sit to get it as it comes out, otherwise on a busy day it's all gone before the conveyor belt reaches you."}
{"text":"Teharu is one of my favorite sushi bars in the valley...but to be honest, it's mostly because of the staff and atmosphere.  I've always received exceptional service here. And, let's face it, once you've gotten your food delivered on a conveyor belt, \"normal\" restaurants just aren't as fun anymore.  In terms of quality, I can't say Teharu is the best. Sometimes the sashimi tastes like it's been on the conveyor belt for a bit too long. But the variety is great, and for $1-$2 a plate, I can't complain!"}
{"text":"2.5 Stars...... Well I was hopeful but not impressed. We waited for 35 minutes, and the front was totally miss managed and unorganized. They continued to call \"Nick\" for almost 20 minutes when it was very clear that \"Nick\" had left (1 star). All I could do was laugh. Once we were seated, the service was very good (5 stars). We put in our drink order and it was brought to us with in 2 minutes! Nice job waiter dude! The sake was just horrible, probably the worst I have ever had (1 star) and let me tell you I can put back sake. The miso soup was pretty good (4 stars). The sushi was not the greatest. Their specialty roll was good but the rest were mediocre at best (2.5 stars). The price was reasonable but I don't think we will ever go back. My significant other really disliked Teharu, he voted for 1 Star but I thought that was pretty harsh. Anyway, I like the whole \"sushi on a conveyor belt\" idea. I have been to a couple other sushi places like Teharu and they are always fun and entertaining, but the sushi was much better. Hope this review was helpful for anyone that is on the fence!"}
{"text":"Been craving to go to this place forever, but since I don't live in this side of the city, I usually don't come here, until recently ...  Went there for late lunch around 3:30pm on a Thursday afternoon, Wasn't very crowded at all since it was way past lunch time.  Sat down by the windows, didn't start picking out the plates of food until we received our drinks.  Each dish cost differently depends on the colors of your plates.  The food is okay, not excellent, but it gets expensive soon after we started eating.  Service was good, drink was cold enough which is definitely a plus since we live in Phoenix and you know how the temperature in Phoenix gets during summer time.  Will definitely go back again if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Cheap? For damn sure! Good? Eh. Good enough when the wallet is a little thin and you still gotta have it. Sorta like a really cheap hooker. They have mostly the standard stuff that won't offend any sushi noobs (the type of folks I usually go to places like this with in the first place because they wouldn't know the difference between this and if JIRO of DREAMS OF SUSHI fame himself were making the sushi). Stuff like maguro, sake (salmon), shrimp, and an endless number of \"rolls\". They also have cheesecake, cream puffs, and little kiddie drinks like Lamune if you need the sugar fix. They charge by the colors of your plates. I don't remember what the color scheme and pricing chart is but all I know is 2 people can eat till being stuffed for as cheap as 20 bucks. That's Kaitenzushi (revolving sushi) for you. That's gotta mean something in this economy right? That's probably why it's always packed when I go. If you go at some prime time be prepared to write your name on the waiting list and wait 15 minutes or so. Located in a strip mall on the northeast corner of Ray and Priest with McDonald's as a main landmark. Parking is strip mall and Teharu is the only real thing happening there so not a problem."}
{"text":"This place is okay its not great but its not bad. The pros about this place is that the sushi comes on a conveyor belt, but not a big selection. It is really cheap for what you get, so if you are looking for a cheap place, most definitely go here. Otherwise there are better sushi places than this ."}
{"text":"This is my fourth time here over the last couple of years.  This place fits into the category of \"You get what you pay for.\"  Cheap bulk sushi but at bottom prices.  It is good for times you are looking for a bulk fill up or if you're not going to mind elementary sushi.  (The cucumbers are absent in their rolls-even in their California rolls-which cukes are a main component!)"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with a conveyor-belt type sushi place. The selection was impressive, although I went back on another occasion and it was the exact same. Service was pretty awful despite the fact that the restaurant was pretty slow (both times). The waiter stood behind us chatting for 20 minutes after we finished eating at the bar before I finally waved him over for the check. Never got a refill on my water, and when I asked about drinks I was offered soda but realized later they had the Sapporo I was after. The water was good though... filtered and all that.  My main complaint is that everything is tepid. Warm gyoza and fried foods are cold and soggy, and \"fresh\" seafood is disturbingly warm."}
{"text":"I enjoy going here with my boyfriend for a cheap sushi dinner. Very well priced and good service. I love it how once you're seated and place drink orders, you're free to start eating off the conveyor. Although I do have a bad habit of getting too many rolls at once to the point of being full and not able to eat the ones I just got. They also have ramune sodas and sake that they send around too. They're fantastic."}
{"text":"Service is awful. They need to learn skills. Awful manners and cleanliness is awful very slow it seems most of them have their heads in other places I hope they understand how rude it comes off I am Not trying to be rude I am just being honest"}
{"text":"First time at a conveyor belt sushi joint. It was mediocre at best. Six of us sat at a table along the side and were left alone by the wait staff for the majority of the time. I think someone stopped by twice to see if we needed any refills. Around 9pm we were asked if we could move to a different table, where the belt was already turned off, because there was a party of 14 that needed to be seated. We wanted to pay and leave anyway so we did just that.  Everyone in the group ate for super cheap...the most expensive thing on any of our bills were the beers for $4.50. The variety was alright, but the majority of everything has crab...and I'm not a crab fan.  If you want cheap sushi and the ability to pick and choose what you want, then I would recommend this place. If you want quality sushi, then go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I honestly think it's cheap, convenient and the food is great (obviously, you wanna to go right when they open since it's fresh) i think for the theme and prices it's totally worth it, plus for sushi in arizona is not bad! the staff is friendly. I would rather eat here 100000000000 more than RA or Stingray sushi"}
{"text":"Great sushi fun atmosphere recommended for family- fun to watch the workers- excellent price& nice selection"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! What a great find! We had two large Kirin Lights and managed to eat enough sushi to feed a small army and the bill totaled $34!!? The salmon nigiri was like butter. We loved this. I can't tell you how much fun it is to sit and watch food come around on a belt and pick and choose what is interesting or pretty coming your way. I found a place like this when I lived in Hawaii and I missed this here on the mainland. Well this is one place that I will return frequently to. Honestly half the price of what our normal sushi bill tends to be! Be prepared to wait for seating as this place fills up quickly. Only disappointment I had was when I went to the bathroom I realized they had an entire section they weren't using and they had people waiting to be seated. Not sure of the reasoning behind that. Obviously the belts are still moving there, maybe they were understaffed. Still...this was unreal how good it turned out and I wish I had known about this place a long time ago!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, great quality food, cheap prices.  You can special order your rolls if your not feeling the conveyer belt options."}
{"text":"I have been a regular here for about a year. The food is really awesome for the price (you can eat your fill for about $15). I recently stopped going as much because they got rid of my favorite role (the Mountain Potato Roll) and nobody of the 5 people I asked could give me a straight answer as to why. They just said \"sorry, we don't serve that anymore.\" Well, that is too bad (talking to you Management) because it cost you a regular customer. I have yet to see them add anything new to the menu either, so the same old menu does seem to get old after a while."}
{"text":"sushi was ok, it was very inexpensive but i really didn't feel that good afterwards, as i did go in there after the lunch rush around 2pm and i think the roll i had maybe was sitting on the conveyor for a while. It tasted good going in but no feel good coming out. Decor was nice, but location sucked as it took me a while to find it stuck behind the mcdonalds off priest. you get what you pay for at this place, rotating sushi is scary if the items get warm and they don't take it off the belt."}
{"text":"On our girls day we were really excited for some inexpensive but good quality sushi, after reading reviews. I was also really excited to experience the rotating sushi bar for the first time. They had a sign that said sign in and sit down. There was a family immediately after us. When the waitress came, she didn't look at the sign in and just ignored us and right before seating the family she last minute asked who was first. So we sit down and politely asked for waters and a menu with prices and a graph that explains the different prices to the different plate colors so we know what to pay. She said ok and brought the water. we asked about the menu again and she said ok. We were then ignored for 20 mins. We found a menu laying on a table on the other side which didn't have prices and no one helped us for 20 mins. We didn't get any food. We kept trying to make eye contact and politely ask the chefs making the rolls and no one could help us or tell us the prices. So after being ignored and seeing our waitress decide to bus tables instead of getting us a menu, we left. We were very frustrated and confused as to why were ignored and why the service was HORRIBLE! The food looked decent but we didn't even get a chance to eat it because we were blatantly ignored. Will never return again."}
{"text":"Yum and yum! This place is a favorite for my daughter and I to have a \"date\". The food is excellent with a variety of rolls, bowls and desserts all floating past on a conveyor belt. I was astonished at how inexpensive the meal was after eating and eating and eating. Having only 3-4 bites per plate, you can sample all sorts of rolls that look appetizing to you. Service is scarce so don't expect any interaction with 'servers'. They don't do anything but bring you a drink and a check at the end when you ask them to total up your cost. The dish color determines the cost. What a great concept. I love trying new things without committing to a whole expensive roll of something. The music isn't too loud so you can easily converse and catch up with a friend or family. I'm not sure how this works at a table, but at the rotating bar, it's fantastic. The place is clean and well lit. Give it a try, you'll find something you like!"}
{"text":"Good place but it definitely seems like the servers play favorites because we never get much attention going in here. I love the revolving sushi bar and have never had any problems with the food here. Love it and the prices!"}
{"text":"First time to a conveyor belt sushi place. I love how fast everything is. It's wonderful for people that don't eat a lot because you can pick and choose small portions. I eat simple rolls but they were all delicious. Will be back soon"}
{"text":"Came here for a family dinner, they seated us very quickly which was a plus because we were all very starving. I don't eat fish so I ordered the avacodo rolls and the avocado was very soft and perfect, I also ordered the Inari which I recommend for kids, It's a tofu pouch with rice inside. It was a little hard to understand the servers when we tried asking what was in the fried onion roll. This was a good experience and I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of weeks ago with some friends. Sushi quality is somewhat fresh. I had better at Sushi Q (all you can eat sushi). If you do not plan to eat more than 4plates worth of sushi then this place is price reasonable. However if you go hungry and are ready to eat and stuff your face, then the price can be hurtful in the end. It was a fun experience and I would go again but, not often. Not a place for more than two people."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place to go if you want to check out a revolving sushi bar! Sushi is good, definitely not the best I've ever had but for the price I'm not complaining! You can get a lot of sushi for not that much with is awesome."}
{"text":"First things first.......the ENTIRE staff here are not friendly and do not acknowledge their customers.  You wait for a seat at the sushi bar by signing your name in a notebook at the door, which means no person greets you.  The food is below average and extremely unappetizing in view.  Very limited selections and tons of the same stuff comes around and around.  The prices are low and if you like sub par sushi, it is better than mass produced sushi at the grocery store.  In all fairness, the 3 servers were handling a full restaurant.  I may try again as it is cheap and two items I had were ok, but I would not venture too far on the menu."}
{"text":"My review is based solely on my Door Dash deliveries since I've never been to the restaurant. We get sooo much sushi for under $30 and it's always prepared beautifully, packaged and delivered in one piece! I love this place and will continue to order!"}
{"text":"3 stars. Here's why.....  They have a great business idea, problem is, they know it. The service staff takes their sweet time. I asked for water twice because I waited 6 minutes after the first time before anyone even walked by the table again. If they are busy enough to need to turn their tables quickly, then why does it take 5-10 minutes for a water? When someone asks for a drink after the initial first drink order has arrived, it's probably that they're thirsty. So now I can't eat anymore until I have something to wash it down, therefore I am taking more time that someone else has to sit and wait. Get it together.  Oh, my daughter also had a hair in her sushi. Not as pertinent but still worth mentioning. If the service staff could brighten up and smile a bit more, and be a little faster when someone is thirsty they would get at least 4 stars. So management, don't ruin what a good thing you have! Get your staff on point."}
{"text":"For a conveyer belt -style sushi place, this was a decent place. I appreciated the covers on the lil traveling plates, and the prices were unbelievably cheap. That being said, it wasn't the greatest selection, and the service was non existent until we waved for drink refills 2x. Of course you're paying 3x less for practically the same portions than at a RA, but there is no  \"fancy sushi ambiance\". And sometimes that's ok! Just come here for an inexpensive light lunch, where you can get a quick sushi-fix."}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi bar.  Good prices and good sushi.  Excellent selection of sushi on the moving conveyor.  Good décor and helpful service staff.  Easy to find at Superstition Springs and Power road.  My only negative comment is the poor selection of beers, but they did have Blue Moon.  I plan to go back again very soon."}
{"text":"Good food but absolutely the worst service I have ever gotten anywhere. I had to ask 3 times for more water and each time I was made to feel like I was inconveniencing them. We had two restless babies by the end of our lunch and no one bothered to bring us a check. We waited 15 minutes before I got up myself to go ask for one. The waitresses were incredibly rude. I have never not left a tip but I left them zero and I will NOT be going back."}
{"text":"Two FAT and FRESH pieces of salmon sushi for just ONE DOLLAR? That is just unheard of, but not at Teharu Sushi. I don't think you can get any better of a deal than this anywhere else. If you do, please let me know! ;)  Nothing on the conveyor belt exceeds $2 and the sushi here is really, really good for the price. I always grab the calamari salad, salmon sushi, egg sushi, Ramune soda, iced green tea (with free refills), and cream puffs each time. I always get at least 5-7 orders of salmon sushi. Greedy, much? YES!  Their special item is Teharu sushi, which is a piece of fish (salmon or tuna) wrapped with really creamy California roll stuffing topped with slices of avocado and a drop of teriyaki sauce. It has to be requested, as it isn't available on the conveyor belt. I highly recommend it!  Service is also very quick and friendly. If anything is not on the conveyor belt, you can request it from one of the sushi chefs or waiters. I've been happy and satisfied with their service each and every one of the gazillion times I've been here.   To be quite honest, I almost wanted to be selfish and not review this restaurant fearing it will help attract more patrons, thus compromising the quality and price. But Yelp has been good to me, so this is my way of giving back. :D"}
{"text":"Love the sushi, I'm a long time fan. Don't get the Ramen though, unless you have a hankering for some Cup Noodle level Ramen."}
{"text":"Wanted to check out the revolving sushi theme, sounded good - quick and cheap, my kind of place. You can literally sit down and starting eating right away. However, the sushi was not very good. Barely even Chinese buffet grade. In fact, I'd rather get buffet sushi and other stuff for the price. The plates add up pretty quickly so value was not all the great really. I will say you do get to try a variety of dishes but the variety is not that extensive. Also, the service was good on the day we went.   After a few plates, my daughter and I did not feel so well. Nausea lasted for a couple of hours. Not sure where the sick feeling came from with so much rice in the pieces? Anyways, I don't care how popular the place gets, you won't be seeing us again."}
{"text":"As with all my reviews, my review of Teharu will compare the food relative to price. Who cares about service right? Go to China and tell me about service. Food is first and foremost.   Nigiri. $1 - Salmon: average quality for being priced at $1, wait how can I say that since I've never had $1 salmon nigiri???? its $1 and throughout my 4 years of going here, not once has it had a fishy smell. No fishy smell = $1 well spent.   -Tuna: similar to the salmon there is no fishy smell, and is $1, this equates to good spending.   -Tamago: not a big fan, had it once, was good. I can't really judge because I dont ever eat tamago but as stated earlier its $1, thus, no mold = $1 well spent.   Nigiri $1.50  -White Tuna: generous cuts given the price. I must emphasize price, some yelpers may disagree here with the cuts but relative to price it is very generous.   - Hamachi: Great and consistent generous cuts.   - Saba: They never have it.   Nigiri in General.   -Uni: Hardly anyone in phoenix eats this stuff which means its hard to find fresh, its a shame because I love this stuff but am too scared to order it here.   -Amaebi: I would not get this, like the uni, many arizonians do not like this stuff. They are unable to turn this stuff over quickly because of this the amaebi like the uni have a significantly longer cycle time, long replenish rate = no bueno!   Conclusion - Good bang for buck! Being a supply chain alumni from ASU I am all about being cost effective, and this place is the knees bees of cost effective sushi dining. Get full off of sushi for under $10? This is unheard of and because of that I give this place four stars. Economically friendly sushi is hard to come by, and at prices as low as a dollar for nigiri, if it don't stank I'll have a drank! :D"}
{"text":"Just went in with 2 other friends to have an inexpensive sushi dinner and several other parties who came in after us were seated before us. Not only was I disappointed in their vibes, but I felt disrespected enough to walk out. When we left, the \"hostess\" had the nerve to tell us to have a good night. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Best sushi I've had in a long time. Definitely keep us coming back. Prices are great"}
{"text":"I love this place, great and amazing prices with decent quality sushi. I always get Dragon Rolls and Rainbow rolls when I come here. I usually have to request them and they always taste great. Not the best, but considering its 2 dollars for 4 pieces of a dragon roll, that is a screaming dea! I always put a little sriracha on my dragon rolls and a little extra eel sauce and I love'em. I work nearby and come here at least once a week. I look at this as the equivalent of fast food sushi, not the best, but still damn tasty. I and my co-workers have never gotten sick eating here. This place is only good for the sushi and haru poppers.   I do recommend ONLY sitting along the primary table area. There are two conveyor belts and they are not linked. The best and freshest sushi seems to always be by the area where they make it.  The wait staff is hit or miss, but the cooks are fantastic and cool to talk too and watch them do their thing. This is a great place to come eat as you can get back before your 1 hour lunch is over. I have only ever eaten here during lunch time between 11-1. It can be crowded but the longest wait I saw was 15 mins, during the week."}
{"text":"I've tried to go to this place a couple times before actually getting to eat there since there is always a huge line. I'm happy I finally got to try it today! My business partner & I ate a TON for about $25. Try the WHITE TUNA! It is phenomenal!!! I also love the fact I can eat within 1 min of sitting down (if the line isn't long)."}
{"text":"Teharu is a wonderfully inexpensive way to get to get a quick sushi fix, especially if you're looking to try new maki or nigiri without shelling out too much cash. Their sushi is not the greatest, but you get what you pay for, right?  If you want to try higher quality sushi, this is not the place you're looking for. They also don't have much variety, as most of the maki on the belt is some variation of California Roll with a different topping.  It's a great place for beginners who haven't had sushi before, as they probably won't have had much experience with better sushi and won't need to pay too much for just a taste.  If you are coming in during the evening, be prepared to wait a good 15 to 20 minutes before being seated. Seating is limited and the place is always packed at these times. The staff has been attentive the three times I've been here, so I have nothing to complain about.    All in all, this place is good fun! I'll definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's convenient, sushi is good, fun experience overall. No menu needed. One major suggestion to make is for the staff to have assigned roles. The waitress is the hostess, the cashier, and the cleaner.  This seems to cause some delays in serving patrons and getting them their checks."}
{"text":"Found this place a few weeks ago on Yelp, as I just moved to the area.  Plus: Decent variety of sushi on the conveyor belt. Inexpensive (generally $1-2 per plate); portions are not surprisingly small, but it gives you the chance to try a lot of things. Love the baked mussels. They have small sides, like udon soup, for only a few bucks to round out your meal.  Minus: Not much space at the counter, especially with stacks of empty plates and lids in the way. Service is somewhat inattentive; can take awhile to get drinks or a soy sauce bowl with wasabi (they should just have these on the conveyor). I always feel like I'm inconveniencing them when I ask for something. Sometimes have to ask for certain items to be refilled when they're low on the belt; if you like something, grab it while you can because it might not be there the next time around!  My biggest complaint about this place is it's always crowded. Even at 3:30 on a Saturday afternoon, the counter will be completely full. The restaurant is a good size, but they seem to keep half of it closed (including half the conveyor belt) to crowd everyone into a small space where the sushi chefs work. Out of 4 times I've been there, only once was the other part open and they were in the processing of closing it down. Tonight I came in around 6:15 and there were 15 people waiting and only half the restaurant being used. We ended up leaving; very frustrating, because they have the space and refuse to use it."}
{"text":"Not bad for a quick bite. I've been here twice and just wish the fish was a little cooler to taste. It's not bad I guess I'm picky with sushi. I didn't realize they have a full menu though. Fun to come with friends."}
{"text":"This is one of my most favorite sushi places ever in the valley! Food is great, and super cheap. (You won't find that at the larger chain sushi restaurants) This place is an absolute must try! Experience the great taste for yourself. Not to mention it's a revolving sushi restaurant so that makes it even cooler."}
{"text":"Love this place for the food and the price. It is good for beginners to experience sushi for the first time. I go during the hours that the huge crowds don't gather but sometimes I have to wait longer for the good sushi to come onto the conveyor belt. Coming in as a single person I usually get seated within 10mins with a crowd. The selection is pretty good and when your done there is a good stack of dished in front of you without the high price. I am not scared to keep grabbing more plates."}
{"text":"I'm telling you right now, this place is amazing! This sushi joint features tables and a bar surrounded by a conveyer belt that rotates constantly. You have the ability to pull anything you want of the line and they charge you by plate color, there is even drinks that travel on this.  I love good sushi and when I'm hungry for it I want it as fast as possible so this place is great.  My biggest gripes about sushi are bad rice and chewy seaweed, and haven't experienced either of these things at this restaurant.   My average trip to Teharu is this: I walk in take a seat at the bar, I'm greeted quickly by a waitress and I order a beer. I watch all this delicious sushi traveling by and I grab everything that looks good and even a plate of edamame to snack on in between. The rolls seem to change a little every day and they have all the great classics. After eating about 3 different rolls my beer comes and then I finish 4 more rolls and snack on the edamame. I can literally eat all the sushi I want and it's pretty tasty and I can have a beer and I can get out of there in under 20 minutes and under 20 bucks. I'm telling you this place can fast and easy or chill and fun. It's a cool experience and I crave it a lot."}
{"text":"Well... Ummm... Let's see... It'd hard to say anything negative against a conveyer belt of food. Wish I had one in my house. But alas, Teharu Sushi is a good experience and more than reasonably priced. It's adequate as far as the food though- Nothing spectacular, but it's a great value. Not a fancy place by any means, just gets the job done. I will definitely go back, but I'm also not raving about the joint."}
{"text":"I am very surprise to find out about this place. Obviously the food taste great and price per plates are range from only $1 to $2 per plate. Awesome!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my husband and I's favorite place for date night. The conveyor of plates makes for a really interesting experience in and of itself. You are welcome, of course, to ask your waitress for anything that isn't available, but half the fun is waiting for it to come around to you and reaching for it.  It's honestly the best tasting sushi we've ever had and well worth it. With fresh ingredients and a nice variety of flavors, we have yet to find a place that we like better. The best part? Even when my husband and I are starved, we don't spend more than $35 plus tip and you get way more than most of the places like Zen 32 that charge you $50 for half of the sushi you can get at Teharu for that price!   The atmosphere is always friendly and clean and the service is great even on the nights when the restaurant is packed. We've never had a bad experience to date. A great date night for sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"Just happen to be in the area so decided since I have been to the one in Chandler it should be good. I was very surprised. First the place looked so much cleaner and more professional. The cooks were dressed all in uniforms. The amount of sushi rotating were all my favorite. I ended up eating way more then I usually can. Exceptionally clean place and well organized team. Was seated quickly and water, wasabi was given to me right away."}
{"text":"Their Scottsdale location is way better & less crowded! But the sushi here is bomb, there's no denying that especially for a belt sushi! I love the shrimp tempura roll the best. The serve sodas in 200 calories bottles which wasn't explained when I ordered it as I was expecting free refills. They are a little stingy giving spicy mayo but still, a decent sushi place & cheap!"}
{"text":"While the cheap sushi may be tempting, the service is the worst, and the waitresses have far more attitude than the trade off for cheap sushi is worth.  We went in at lunch and asked to be seated at the bar where there were clearly 5 open areas that would have seated our party (of 4) but they refused to seat us unless we sat at a table because 'lunch is coming'.  Not seating us because our party (of ONLY 4) was too big was stupid and rude!!  We went elsewhere and won't be returning."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  My friend and I went for a late lunch and politely asked to be seated at a table (which were all open) and were told that they were for large parties only and we had to sit at the (crowded) bar. We were smooshed in between two people at the bar of the conveyor belt (and I mean....almost on their freakin' laps). As we sat there, we saw that there was a party of two being seated at one table a single customer at another. We were very taken aback by this. The prices are very inexpensive, as long as you keep track of what you are pulling from the belt. Each plate is priced based upon its color. They have the \"price/color key\" in front of you at the bar. The sushi seems to come with four pieces on each plate. The fish isn't always the freshest, sometimes tasting grainy or with an overly fishy smell that comes with age. The service is lackluster, with unfriendly wait staff who clearly don't want to be there. We had to ask for our check several times and never received a drink refill. So disappointing, as the conveyor belt is a cool concept. I think I will stick to made-to-order sushi at Mikado from now on."}
{"text":"I will say the sushi is good and reasonably priced, but the service is just as important. The service here is utter garbage. Seriously, I'd probably get better service from garbage. Every time we come here we're ignored once we're seated. It always takes us forever to get our drinks, and when we do get them, they're never refilled. My friend has multiple allergies and had to put in a separate order. After having to flail my arms to flag down the waitress she never put the order in. She decided to take her break right in front of our table, so my friend got to sit there and watch our waitress eat her lunch. We had to get the manager to get us our check and we left fuming. I don't care how good the food is, you don't treat your customers like this. The staff here needs to pull their heads out of their asses and learn how to treat paying customers."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Great food, great prices! The service was a little slow when needing drinks or special orders but it was really busy that night too. This was my first conveyor belt sushi experience and it left me craving it more after gorging myself the one night. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I agree with other commenters that it's surprising tasty for the relatively small expense.  Someone else said the squid salad was great and it totally was.  Why only three stars, then?  Also echo the other comments about rude or weird waitstaff.  My experience was this was I was sitting and waiting for a dish to come around when I was approached by a woman who told me she could order something for me, but did so in a tone of voice that a kindergarten teacher might use to inform Billy that if he needs to go to the bathroom he can raise his hand.  \"These stupid customers\" oozed out of her.  I'll go back and try it again (2x already).  But one or two more crappy experiences with the staff and that'll be it for me."}
{"text":"I'm personally not a fan of MOST conveyor belt sushi places, the reason why? The quality is not good.  These conveyor places put out a lot of product all at once, so naturally they aren't going to use the top-shelf stuff...it's cheap, basic, dry, whatever fish and rice. The Tempura here is junk, it's all breading and no meat or vegetables, by far the worst tempura I've had in a long time. I can usually polish off a tempura plate even if it's average, but I gave up after 2 or 3 pieces, no thank you. The sashimi pieces are dry and room temperature..not even slightly chilled, and that really ruins it. Sashimi is supposed to be served fresh and COLD not 70 degrees and dry.  The service was slow and it took forever to get a first water, refills took a while too, and when we were seated we got no menus, it was pretty much a \"sit here, shut up, eat, leave\" routine. You can tell the staff never learned any hospitality skills. The overall setting is odd, there is the main half of the restaurant where everyone will be surrounding a conveyer, but the other half of the dining room is empty and bare. There is also a huge wait, at least 20-30 people were sitting there waiting for a spot to open up...yet there's a whole other side of the restaurant with an empty conveyor being unused...why not open it up? I don't get it.  Average, meh, whatever fish and rice, and terrible tempura that's really all there is to it. The one plus is that it's cheap for 1 or 2 people to grab a quick bite, other than that it's not worth remembering or going back. It's MEH at best. A week or so after eating here I read yelp reviews and saw how many health violations this place had, I felt lucky nothing got me and my party sick! Won't be returning. Go down to the street to RA or something."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places for lunch. It is a revolving bar so if that creeps you out, then I would stay away from here. The prices are ridiculously affordable and the sushi is good and more fresh than you would expect. There is ALWAYS a wait I have found which is obnoxious, however the wait is never more than five to ten minutes. Not the best sushi I ever had but a convenient and cheap option!   My favorites here are the baked mussels, las vegas rolls, and spicy crab and shrimp rolls!"}
{"text":"I rarely leave reviews, but when I'm treated as poorly as I was tonight, I feel my experience should be shared.   My family came in tonight and asked for a table for 8. We were led to a table made for 6 and watched as an employee moved two chairs to the end of the table (the other end of the table was against the sushi conveyer belt). These two chairs were literally touching the chairs at the end of the long sides of the table, leaving absolutely no place to put your legs.   So I said to the employee, \"Um, if you set up the chairs like this, where should we put our legs?  Is there a better solution for a table of 8?\"  He asked me to hold on and went to speak to someone else.   Moments later, an older woman came over to us with a very aggressive attitude and said, \"Ma'am, if you don't like our service, you don't have to eat here,\".  I was completely taken aback by her approach and tried to explain that I was only asking if there was a better set-up for our party. She continued to berate me, making fun of my facial expression and telling me that this set-up was the only way to seat 8.  I told her I didn't have any issue with the set-up if it was the best they could do...I was honestly just asking. She walked away and we sat down.  Then the woman approached our table *again* and told us that we didn't need to stay if we didn't like their service.   A restaurant telling me twice that they don't need my patronage is enough for them to lose my business forever, so we left. I will never - EVER - set foot in that restaurant again."}
{"text":"This is a really fun place to get some sushi mostly because of the laid back and social atmosphere.  As most everyone notes, the price point is awesome.  It encourages you to sample a lot of things that you likely otherwise wouldn't.    All in all, The sushi is good, the service is also very good (for those things that are served), and mostly the price is amazing."}
{"text":"For the money you pay it's really a well thought out restaurant.  You pay from $1-$2 per plate, and each one has two to four pieces of delicious nigiri and sushi!  Thanks for the conveyor belt of love Teharu!"}
{"text":"Wow. I really don't know why this place has more than 2 stars to be honest. I'm not one to complain, but I and a group of friends have given this place several opportunities. After every chance especially tonight , if you're looking for service that's cheaper than their $1.50 plates then you've found your spot. I waited over twenty minutes for one roll, which came out cold, while the gentleman I asked was listening to music behind me sitting in a booth, had to ask several times for eel sauce, waited over 40 minutes for a seat while several larger parties went before us when we checked in first then the waiter offered to bring us food at the waiting booth, and all the cold sushi that should have been warm you could imagine. Seriously dude?"}
{"text":"This is now my new favorite sushi restaurant. The food is delicious and fresh and the prices are great"}
{"text":"Seriously love this place ! There is always a seat u get to watch them make the sushi fresh and they have a ton of different options! And the servers are always attentive to any needs. This is my go to restuarant when I'm on a budget to eat amazing sushi!"}
{"text":"Came over for a birthday dinner since it is so close to our new home and the reviews are pretty good. What a disappointment!!! Sunday evening they only have 2 sections open. So we waited for our table. We told one of the waitress that we will be outside after she took our name. While we were outside saw that more people started coming at least 5 more families. One of the waitress ask for our name again so we said we already had our name down. But some some reason, the other waitress( one of the three) crossed our name off without asking or communicated with her co workers! And she go ahead and continue seated other families before us! And we told  her that she skipped us and she said \"ok, I know\". So pretty much at that point my boyfriend and i don't want anything to do with her at all!!!!  Get to the point the food is ok. Nothing special than just low price sushi.  The service is shitty!! If you are the first time customer here and they don't know you, you are pretty much do not exist to them!!!!3 waitresses working the front, don't have to serve food just drinks and still can't make it ok. We have to go up to them and asked for our ticket and tell you what we had??? Not just us but the couple next to us had to do the same thing!!  Maybe I will return just because I don't feel like spending my money and just want something cheap that better than fast food or if fry's is run out of sushi there"}
{"text":"Four rolls (Shaggy Dog, Dragon, Baked Scallop, Soft Shell Crab) and a squid salad for $12.75. What a steal.   Teharu prices are super affordable (dirt cheat, for lack of better terms) compared to your average sushi restaurant. I prefer Teharu over Eastwind in DT Chandler, which offers the same concept.   If you're dining in, you will get to experience the conveyor belt. It's a neat concept until you realize that the same plates have been making the same rotation so maybe it's not so fresh.. but you can't ask for too much when you're paying $4 max on a plate. For that reason, I chose to order take out today."}
{"text":"This place closes at 10pm not 10:30pm. It needs to be changed on Yelp. I just got here at 9:40pm thinking I had plenty of time and the sushi bar was closed so couldn't order anything. I ended up just leaving. Make a note of it people."}
{"text":"The sushi here was alright, but I have definitely had better. 3 stars for the sushi and 1 more for how cheap it is."}
{"text":"The conveyor belt of endless sushi is a sushi lover's dream come true! The atmosphere was very fun and the inexpensive food just adds to the night! The quality of the food surpasses the price and the all you can eat style of just grabbing the plates is liberating knowing you're not breaking the bank! The Haru Sushi was my favorite of the many dishes that were completed! Definitely a fun night out~ but be wary of when you arrive and check the busy times because you may be waiting for a seat if you do not go earlier into the night, especially if you have a bigger party."}
{"text":"Sushi variety is basic traditional stuff, and the quality isn't close to what you find at a Kabuki. But hey, I got to pick and choose anything I want and only spent little over $12, so not a big deal."}
{"text":"Have been here on Friday night and wasn't too happy... came on a Monday and was much better. Didn't know I could order something not on the conveyer and they'd make it!! Bonus!!"}
{"text":"Love the idea of not having to wait for my food. It's quick, cheap and tasty, what more can you ask for? I recommend getting the Haru sushi and also salmon skin hand roll.   It's my first time in this location and I must say it's much cleaner and nicer than the one in Chandler. Unfortunately, their rolls and sashimi are smaller here. I'd still come back though, still hits the spot for a quick sushi fix."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Everyone complaining is just a typical (entitled) Scottsdale snob. The same people that can't speak one word of another language, but unload on hardworking people who can't speak English perfectly.   The prices are amazing and the quality is great. I have never had any complaints when eating at Teharu. But I'm not a racist redneck."}
{"text":"Eaten there a couple times and for what it is, budget friendly revolving sushi, I have zero complaints. The haru poppers are great. If you like heat ask them to leave the seeds and membrane in the jalapeños. Head there with $20 and have a feast. Also if you see something on the menu that isn't already \"revolving\" just ask them. They'll make it fresh for you."}
{"text":"Its a revolving sushi bar, level set your expectations. And for a revolving sushi bar, this place is great! It is hit or miss on the variety though. Sometimes its full of the same few items, others its a mix and something new every time you look up."}
{"text":"Teharu is a good sushi restaurant, especially if you are on a budget. The rotating belt carries rolls that start at $1 and up to $2.50 ( I think). It's a great place to go fill your sushi craving and go. I've never waited long for a table and the service is good. The food itself is decent, but for the value you can't really complain. Friendly and clean atmosphere keeps me and my family coming back."}
{"text":"They just open a week ago, everything fresh and service was great. High recommend for this place!!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place-- I have eaten there as well as taken out.  While the sushi isn't the Best sushi I have ever had.. It's good and very reasonable. I also like the portion size so you can try various rolls! It always seems very fresh and they are always friendly."}
{"text":"I hate the plastic lids. The wait is too long especially if there is seating available.  Other then that it's good."}
{"text":"Chandler Arizona is not usually associated with sushi but in my mind it is now! I hold this place somewhat above its strip mall location in the suburbs  It is not often I am taken by a sushi place like this because this one is a little tucked away, all quiet and un-assuming ...  and BAM! great fish .. Just like that out of nowhere..Cheap! Its like a ninja or something?  We got there right before they were closing ( we called and asked them if it was o.k. first) ..things were already being wrapped up. they unwrapped everything and served us with all the patience of a good restaurant.  Octopus fresh , ika decent , squid salad delicious.. Japanese hip hop playing for music .. Japanese crazy game shows on TV..  My New favorite rotating sushi boat type plate place here.. And there were three of us and we got out of there super cheap with beer for less than 12 bucks a piece! Stuffed to the brim too!  I am a total fan of this place .. it did it for me. Check it out its got mad fish skills :P"}
{"text":"Food is always good and I love coming just to get a quick in and out sushi fix. However the customer service sucks ass. Yes, I understand their under staff and can't seat people as fast as customers in BUT set expectations for your customers when they first walk in. Therefore customers can decide if they want to wait or not. Don't get mad because we've waited over 30 minutes for a table because you gave our seats away or didn't count correctly how many people was with our party. Advice: acknowledge your customers at all time. A simple I'm sorry for the wait does not hurt. No matter if your place is hole in the wall, as long as the food is good and customer service is awesome people will continue to come."}
{"text":"So I have been going here for years. We have other sushi places closer to us but drive 20 minutes because normally this is our favorite. But over the last few visits things have been getting worse and worse. The food itself is still good, the problem is the staff. We walk in and there are 2 large groups ahead of us and 1 small group. We visibility see open spots at the bar but have to wait to be seated. I hear one of the big groups talking to one of the staff members who is telling them it is going to be nearly impossible to seat them because 6 six people is too many to sit at the bar. They point out to the staff member that there is a whole row of empty tables that will work. The staff member tells them that they can sit there but will have to walk to an from the bar to get food because the owner refuses to turn that side of the conveyor belt on. They reach an agreement and get seated. Meanwhile more chair are opening and we still can't go to them (a total of 20 minutes) because no one is bothering to clean them off or check the names in the list. When we finally get seated our waiter takes our drink order, puts it down, and proceeds to disappear for the rest of our visit. The staff mostly stands around or talks with each other and had no sense of urgency when it came to taking care of us. No one ever checked in and we had to wave someone else down to get our check. He had to count 3 different times the number of plates we had, and then got someone else to come over and check his counting.  I am hoping that the owner sees this, I hope they take note and open up the second side again. I hope they hear the service their staff is giving."}
{"text":"Since I have been to this place at least a dozen times I  am giving two stars instead of one; it was at one time really good for the price... that being said at this point in time the staff is neither informed or very helpful and the sushi is less quality than what I've bought from convenience stores."}
{"text":"This was such a fun experience.  I have never eaten at a resturant that utilizes a convayer belt instead of a waitress...  Apparently, this is a big thing in Los Angeles.. and I am just BEHIND the times.  My husband and I met a friend for dinner, and this was fantastic.  I loved  being able to plop down and start eating with waiting for anything but the perfect roll.   There is northing gormet about these rolls, there are philly rolls, Las Vegas Rolls, and other various tasty treats.  It's cheap, tasty, and above all, affordable.   The wait staff exsists to bring you drinks, and take orders for anything you don't see - however, it did take almost 15 minutes for someone to stop by and take a drink order.   I feel like a self serve soda fountain (cups delivered on a plate?) might be in order...   Can not WAIT to visit this again - and it's so close to work, it might be my new lunch place!"}
{"text":"The past three visits have been bad. I'll just tell you about my latest. So we show up an hour before close and sit down. We weren't the only people there and it was a weekend night. Well we notice there is no new sushi going around so, the waitress tell us they will be closing kitchen in 15 mins if we want to order. She gives us the menu and comes back 10 minutes later. We put in my order, which of most she says they are unable to make because they lack supplies, then leaves. Comes back 5 minutes later and says actually the kitchen is closed... the place was still technically open for 30 more minutes, most of our time was wasted with the waitress. Why not change their closing time?? I will not be going back."}
{"text":"You're not coming here for top-shelf sushi. They don't try to make it a secret that their fish comes frozen and vacuum-sealed in plastic bags that need defrosting over running water. But it's quick and staff is friendly. My split bill was around $15 per person but we were stuffed and could have done with a few less items. It'll do for the occasional sushi craving. Grab the hots while they are hot."}
{"text":"Good food with great prices. It can get very crowded around dinner time. The revolving food conveyer belt is fun for kids and makes it easier to get what you want. The selection fluctuates and becomes less the later it gets. Some dishes are better than others, but that's often a matter of taste and personal preference. I think for what you pay, you will get good food, but don't expect to be in a sushi bar in Kobe or Tokyo."}
{"text":"I like their idea of revolving sushi. The portions are reduced which allows you to try a variety of different sushis. Pricing is decent. I would recommend giving this place a try. You can see them make the sushi and put it on the belt which shows it's made fresh."}
{"text":"The price is RIGHT. The sushi is acceptable and my wife and I got more than our fill for like $25. Yeah I know a bunch of sushi for $25 and it was good."}
{"text":"Worst customer service , ask if we can order , gave us the \"Idgaf\" face , never asnwered us back , straight up rude , it was only 45 mins til closing time ,"}
{"text":"this is how it works u go inside and sit down the plates start to roll in and you pay for whatever u eat  most plates are $1.50  stuffed  peppers were goood !!  must try   i paid under $20 for two ppl  i want to go again !!"}
{"text":"Usually love this place but we had somewhat of a big party (8) & waited more than an hour to be seated but left. They had seating open for only half the restaurant when it was super busy. It's not the first time this has happened & it is super upsetting. I understand the staff is trying their best & people take too long to eat & socialize after but they need to do something about this. We waited for more than an hour and a group who came waaaay after us got seated before us. If they waited just a little for the belt seating or saved a table and added chairs, we could have easily been seated. Instead, they put me and my party off to where we were literally the second to last ones waiting to eat sushi. I give the staff and service a one star but the sushi is 4/5"}
{"text":"Very affordable sushi restaraunt.  Cooks make a dozen or more varieties of sushi on rice and sushi rolls and place the plates on a conveyor belt that winds through the restaraunt.  All tables are next to the belt and you just grab the plates you want as they come by.    Different color plates let you know the price of what you are choosing.  At the end the server adds up all the plates in front of you and that's the cost.  $12 - $15 per person would be an average bill.  Well worth giving it a try."}
{"text":"I remember going to this place when it first opened.  Last Sunday was probably my first in a long time.  The sushi is okay.  Its got upbeat j-pop or k-pop playing.  The atmosphere feels like something that came out of an anime.   If I go back, the sushi is not the reason."}
{"text":"This is the third time I've reviewed Teharu, and each time I go I feel this place has progressively gotten worse. I imagine that bugs taste better than this place.  The service here is absolutely horrible. My husband and I came in around 2/2:30 today (Sunday) and waited 15-20 minutes while a waiter spoke on the phone before we were seated. Not to mention, no one acknowledged us upon entering, or sitting for a few minutes. The sushi here tastes too sweet, and very rubbery.  I don't like grocery store sushi, but I've had WAY better sushi across the street at AJ's.    I refuse to dine here.  I'd rather spend $4-6 on a California roll elsewhere."}
{"text":"another thing I like about Teharu.  If you're trying to get some sushi on the quick, here you can sit down, order up a drink and start grabbing plates.    and if you're feeling adventurous and want to try something new, you only spending $1-3 per plate."}
{"text":"Fun with a capital Fun. Conveyor belt sushi has been all the rage in japan for 50 years, but this is the first for the valley. Pretty good quality, low prices and great selection. Remember conveyor belt sushi etiquette - take only from your side and not the other, if you touch it - you have to take it. Stack plates according to price and color and have fun!"}
{"text":"If your looking for cheap sushi thats under quality this is your place. I work in the restaurant business, and my previous position was at a sushi restaurant so I know sushi. The sushi is mediocre at best. It's a conveyor belt style so you get what you pay for. I tried ordering off the menu some nigiri and clearly it wasnt fresh considering they served it to me about 30 seconds after I odered. When your order nigiri it comes in 2 pieces on the same plate (priced on the menu as 2 pieces) but they serve you an empty plate under the sushi place which establishes you had two pieces of nigiri. Not understanding why they served me and extra plate under the nigiri I put it aside. They charged me for the 2 pieces of nigiri and they extra empty plate. When I asked why I was double charged they said they only charge the top plate. This was very confusing and not worth arguing the extra 3 dollars. In the end there are way better sushi places. I recommend seskan, sushi & cocktails, ahi revolving sushi, and ninja sushi. Cheers! Happy eating!"}
{"text":"The wife and i love sushi, and im glad we found this place. I have never been to a sushi bar that has a revolving counter, but im glad there is one located so close. We have now been here a total of 3 times in a month and all 3 times it was decent. Its nice getting to try new sushi types without spending a ton of money. You got to try the haru popper!!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a fast and inexpensive sushi restaurant, this is your place. No dish is over $3 & you can be in and out in under 30 minutes. Of course with price comes quality - In my opinion the seaweed is always really chewy, and the rice sometimes overly sticky making it mushy but paying $2 for salmon sushi, you can't get much better.   There is a revolving sushi belt. Sometimes they shove as many people as they can around it which makes it a little uncomfortable, but the music is always pretty loud so you can still get a small sense of privacy.  My favorite dish is the rainbow roll as I feel it's the most fresh, but the crab and I love salmon roll are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Finally visited this place after hearing about it from my sister and her husband. The two reasons I wanted to visit this place; cheap sushi and the conveyor belt that the sushi is delivered on.  Very cute and kitschy. This isn't a place to go if you want to impress a date but a great place for friends/family to hang out and get inexpensive sushi.  Loved: what other sushi place serves cream puffs? Granted, it's the same cream puffs that you get in the freezer section of Costco but still - adorable. Your sweet, Teharu and I like you for that.  I am easily entertained and came up with many fun things to do with that conveyor belt that may or may not get me kicked out of the restaurant - things like sending notes with the food to other patrons. Funny, yes. Entertaining for me? Absolutely.   I'll probably go back but it won't be a \"MUST HAVE TEHARU\" craving sensation."}
{"text":"I see that this place is still as filthy as it was when I wrote my first review. It made CBS channel 5's dirty dining list tonight! In fact, they were the dirtiest of them all with a whopping 12 major violations from the health department. Wow. The news said if they do not correct they may get shut down. I think this would be a good idea and could keep people from getting sick."}
{"text":"Our friend was so excited to take us here but I can not believe this place is still in business and the health department has not been called or checked on them. Warm sashimi sushi that came straight from the sushi chef, a piece of medal was in the spicy tuna roll, nothing tasted fresh and dirty plates given to us. If you want food poisoning go here."}
{"text":"I have ordered carry-out from here twice now (I only live about 5 minutes away). I was referred to this place by a couple different people and was told it was amazing (although they haven't been here in a while). The first time I ordered about 6 different items and was amazed when my total price came out to about $11. The place was also crowded with a fairly long wait so I assumed the rolls would be coming out fresh.  When I got home my experience quickly changed...I ate a California roll and it tasted fine, not great but not bad, a piece of salmon sushi which was also fine.  I then tried the spicy tuna and it was disgusting!  So fishy that the spices couldn't cover up that taste.  Followed by the tuna nigiri which was also extremely fishy.  Sadly I couldn't even finish half of my order because it contained tuna or spicy tuna.  I decided to try and give it another shot since it was so cheap and just to avoid the tuna altogether. I again ordered about 6 items coming to around $11; when I placed my order I was told they may not have the spicy salmon and asked if it would be fine to replace it with spicy tuna, I quickly said no and provided another possible substitution.  I ordered salmon skin so it took a while (as expected) but I ended up waiting for the spicy salmon at the end; I was advised that \"they were able to find some\" which alone made me extremely nervous.  I finally get my food and head home hoping that this experience would be different than the last. It wasn't. The spicy salmon now tasted fishy and the rice tasted hard and stale. The California roll was so covered in mayo that it wasn't enjoyable, the salmon skin was extremely salty, and the salmon nigiri was slightly fishy.    I do have to say that the staff was very nice and helpful both times I was there which was quite unexpected based on the other reviews.  It would have been great to find sushi for such a low price but there is a reason the great sushi places are much more expensive. I have had a lot of sushi from a lot of different places and I will not return here again, I also would not recommend this place to anyone. I would rather spend twice as much and go to a place like Sushi Eye where I know the fish will taste fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Teharu is JUST okay.  I noticed when it first opened they had more variety and a better taste but  it seems like their quality isn't as good as it used to be. To be fair though, the Scottsdale location is just a bit better than the Tempe location."}
{"text":"Make sure get there early or call for a reservation. It gets really busy pretty much every night, especially on the weekends."}
{"text":"I can't express how much I LOVE this place, the sushi is awesome, the prices are great, the staff is great too. It can be very busy at times but it is an awesome place. The awesome part is that you pick the sushi from the conveyer belt, so you are able to look at the sushi before you try it. I live an hour away but i come here a few times a month."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie and say this is the best sushi, but it is a good value. You kinda have to know what to choose, and once that's figured out it can make for a pretty good dining experience. I would not recommend going at a slow time, and I would recommend choosing the more popular dishes as those are usually the freshest due to turnover rate. They also offer made to order sushi, which will be the freshest choice but that can take some time. This place is great for a quick, healthy, and cheap lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"LOVE me some conveyor belt sushi. Easy to control how much you're eating or spending, fun to go to with co-workers, convenient location. The dishes are right for the price, and oh yeah, they taste good. I used to go to the one down on Priest and Ray, but my work location makes this one much more convenient. I always feel charged up for the afternoon after a few servings of good sushi at lunch. The only thing I'd love to see them change - and I complain about this to them every time we're there - install something to be able to open more tables. Really. It wouldn't be hard. I'm an engineer - I can help you. You have 8 extra tables, and I watched at least 5 groups walk back out rather than wait like we did. Make sure your popularity doesn't hurt you. \"Oh let's don't go there, it takes too long to get a table.\" Enough people start saying that... and you won't need to open the extra tables."}
{"text":"Okay, so I have to admit, I wasn't the biggest fan of Teharu. Being a new-ish sushi eater {and not super daring} I found the quality, fishiness, and crazy use of mayo and crunchy toppings to not be appealing.   However, i'm a total believer that you get what you pay for hence the 3 stars. When you order a 4-piece sushi roll that is under $1.50, the quality should be questioned. I saw so many rolls go around and around their tracks that weren't getting eaten, therefore, just sitting out in the open {with lids for germ protection} and not refrigerated. With the mayo, fish, etc. on the rolls this made me so nervous!   How it works:  They have a variety of different sushi, rolls, edamame, cucumber salad, desserts, drinks, pot stickers, etc. rotating around a huge bar-type setup. Each item is on a colored plate and the color associates it with the price. The prices were $1, $1.50, and $2 depending on which plates you grab. Then, at the end the waitresses add up your plates to determine your bill. While service is extremely quick because you simply just grab what you want, I believe that as a result, the freshness goes out the window. Out of the few rolls that I tried, they were all pretty fishy and warm. My pet peeve is warm sushi! It has gotta be COLD! I ended up sticking with the cucumber salad, pot stickers, and edamame to play it safe.   The scariest part for me was that some of the items literally looked like plastic. The crab was 100% artificial and looked that way. Yikes, it just freaked me out.   That said, I won't be back but if you aren't super picky about the quality of your seafood/sushi and want a quick, cheap sushi fix, I can see how Teharu could be a great place to go."}
{"text":"Price was decent food was good. The waiting service on the other hand was crappy. If you need napkins or a refill on your beverage goodluck and when we did get noticed the guy says ive got checks for 3 tables in a rude way. Like i needed to know that...its your job dude lol... He could have said sure no prob plus it wasnt busy it was after the lunch hour rush. Thats why the 2 stars."}
{"text":"This is my dirty little secret. You can seriously eat your face off for a ridiculously small amount of money. It makes me wonder how they do it. It's a shameful feeling I get inside when I see that I have the highest sushi tower ... until I see it only cost me $12. I literally have never been able to eat more than $15 worth of food at this place, and believe me, I've tried. It's not going to light the world on fire, but it's cheap and fun. Plus, Phoenix has literally zero other options when it comes to conveyor belt sushi."}
{"text":"Good, clean, unpretentious fun.  You walk in, sit down, and can immediately start grabbing from the conveyor belt whatever your hungry little heart desires.  Choose from standards such as nigiri, cali rolls, and gyozas to ridiculousness like V8, fruit cups, and cream puffs.  Wash it down with some Japanese marble soda or just a good ol sake bomb.    The value is fantastic; each plate you pull costs you $1-$2, with a plate generally consisting of 2-4 pieces of sushi or a few ounces of salad.  You can stuff yourself silly here for under $20, can't do that at any other sushi place unless you suffer from anorexia nervosa.    A bottle of unagi sauce comes with every table (heart)  The main tradeoff is that the quality's not as good as you'll find at a higher-end sushi establishment, but still very edible.  Also the place gets  zerged during dinner hours so be prepared to wait a bit even on a Wednesday or Thursday.   Service can be slow sometimes so bring a bit of patience.  Give this place a try so they make more $$$ and can open a second spot further up north =D"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, very very inexpensive  Excellent quality and they have all kinds of variety. I liked the Miso soup so yummy and staff is very kind and there to help A+++++++"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice so far and I've really enjoyed it.  I like that all the plates have small portions, so you can try lots of different kinds of sushi without spending too much or having to eat 8 rolls of the same kind before moving on to another kind.  I sure wish this place was closer to home, I'd eat here all the time.  The staff is kinda meh, but the food is great and if you like sushi at all, this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"SIMPLY AMAZING!  WE LOVE IT!  My hubby and I stopped in one day after deciding NOT to go to NYPD.  They were next door, and we thought lets try something new. We have been there 3 times since. You sit, and the food comes by and you just grab what you want off the rotating bar. ITS GREAT! Especially if you can not decide what you want until seeing it. We ate like King and Queen for $20.00.  They have simple pricing, and it is affordable for a date or family."}
{"text":"Passable, but really cheap sushi.  The rice is a bit hard and the sushi is a bit too warm, but the service is so friendly and the price so cheap that I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"IF YOU CAME HERE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW ABOUT THIS PLACE, Start scrolling and you will see everyone mentioned a very rude lady. IF YOU COME AND SEE THE BITCH WITH THE NIKE LOGO EYEBROWS YOU WILL NEVER WANT TO COME BACK. SOMEONE FOUND A ROACH LEG ON THEIR SUSHI. I waited for 10 mins at the door no one sat me, even though a couple people walked past me and dindnt even look at me. I sat myself cause there was a ton of empty spots. This one lady got mad at me and said \"WELL WE ALL BUSY SO\" THIS B!TCH LOOK LIKE THE MATCH MAKER IN MULAN with her dark ass eyebrows.She actually asked me to MOVE OUT OF MY SPOT SO SHE CAN SAT OTHER PEOPLE THERE. WHERES THE FUCKING MANNERS?!? She brought me my water and slammed it on the table, I couldn't even drink the water cause I'm afraid she probably took it from the toilet, she took my order paper after IGNORING ME SOME MORE and tossed it to the lady making infront of me. EXTREMELY RUDE. I'm sure she's the owner too, IF THE OWNER IS TREATING PEOPLE LIKE THAT HOW THE WORKER WILL TREAT YOU?!? The worker was yelling across the restaurant in Korean, this family brought their young baby and the baby started screaming and the MATCHMAKER started giving them attitude. WOW JUST WOW. Reasonable price but service is horrible if you go around dinner it's best to go before 6, the quality is shit but cheap."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend visit this sushi joint at least every other week. The staff knows our faces now and it's nice to be able to visit back every now and then. The sushi here is low cost, good value, and always fresh. You can see them make it and then put it on the revolving sushi line. It's literally a grab and go eat type of place. They don't only have sushi, they have a full lunch and dinner menu, if you aren't a raw foods type of person. I would definitely recommend this place to try out once!"}
{"text":"Love the sushi here and the price is great!! The wait is sometimes long but really worth it. You can grab food instantly off the conveyer or order from the list! The fish slices are thick and the sushi delicious!  Absolutely love this place!!"}
{"text":"A really cool concept with sushi on a conveyer belt for rock bottom prices.  The quality of fish is decent with a good variety of nigiri and rolls.  I was a fan of their yellowtail and spicy tuna topped with tuna and my girlfriend swears by the Haru Poppers  I'll be back as often as I'm down on this side of town for sure considering our party of four ate for $40!  I spend that on myself alone at a Sushi Brokers or Kabuki.  Different quality of fish for sure but still a great bargain with good tastes."}
{"text":"First, and foremost, my review is of the dining experience overall so that people who have never been there know what to expect. As cheap sushi goes, it's not terrible. You're definitely not going to like everything on the menu but it's easy to fill up on a couple things that you do like. The portion sizes are decent and the quality is pretty okay. Nothing amazing or life changing about this place. I usually come here for lunch for a quick bite when I don't have time to wait in a nice restaurant.   Now, one thing to consider is that the service is horrendous. Oh god, it's awful. You're drink may be refilled once, if you're lucky. But no need to get upset about it. Just be vocal with your requests. It's a nuisance, sure. I too am used to be treated like a damn princess when I dine at a nice restaurant so I get it. Being ignored is annoying. But this is far from a nice restaurant so don't walk in expecting that kind of service. You're just setting yourself up for failure if you do. Instead, just accept that this is the culture of the restaurant and speak up. You're on your own, folks.   It's one of those symbiotic relationships where it's like, \"I hate you, you hate me but I want your cheap sushi and you want my money despite not really wanting to work for it. If I had wanted five star service, I would've gone to Kabuki and you know that you cheap whore. I knew exactly what this was when I walked through the door. \"  So yeah. That's the Teharu experience in a nutshell."}
{"text":"This place has the WORST service I've experience in quite sometime. We walked in and not on person on the payroll greeted us. We read the sign it said sign  In and wait to be seated. We waited 5 minutes still no acknowledgement we were even in the restaurant. The whole time we stood waiting we watched the busser/waiter clean a spot on the counter and he had to be the one of the slowest bussers/waiters I've ever seen. We ended up seating ourselves after waiting and waiting then he took forever to get a drink order. There was no greeting, no explaination, NOTHING. It was embarrassing to watch other people walk in and just sit down watch other people and wait to see if they were ecer going ti be seated. We asked for refills on our drinks a couple times, took forever to get the check. I felt like I was a bother just being there, giving them business, what a mistake I made by going there.  Never will again. Food was mediocre."}
{"text":"Value Value Value!!!    Yes the portions are small, but the price is so low that is truly great value, plus you end up getting more variety and can experiment a little more.    I see the best value in the Salmon or Tuna Nigiri, because it is only $1 per order.    If you preferred the americanized Las Vegas Rolls and Philly Rolls the price doubles all the way to $2.  Still a great value....  For the veterans who love sushi and eat Uni and Natto, you can order them, but they usually jump up to $3 and only made when you order them.      Yes there is conveyor belt which turns a lot of sushi snob friends off, but I don't mind.  Plus, I end up ordering directly from the sushi makers if I don't see what I want on the belt.    It isn't fine dining, but it is great value.  Service is a little rough....thus only 4 stars.  This place always seems to be understaffed.  Just be vocal and you get what you need.....  My japanese wife and I come about 1 per month and see outstanding value.  It is always busy at peak hours, so you are best to go a little before or after peak lunch or dinner times."}
{"text":"Is this great sushi?  No.  Does this food reinvent the sushi wheel?  Not even close.  Will I have a foodgasm?  Not a chance. When I am craving an amazing sushi meal, I'll go to Yasu.  Why I really, REALLY like Teharu: The food is fresh.  While it's not amazing fish, there's nothing wrong with it - nothing here to get sick from. All the standards are readily available and if you want something not already on the belt, they'll gladly make it for you. The conveyor really feeds into my lack of patience.  I sat down, ordered an iced green tea, and started pulling plates off the belt.  Yes, I was eating sushi within 90 seconds of sitting down! The price is a HUGE plus!  I met a friend for lunch - we each had iced tea, several plates with 3 or 4 roll slices, seaweed salad, sunumono salad and a couple nigiri and I was out of there for less than $20, including tip. The place is kept incredibly clean, staff is friendly and Teharu fills a nice niche for a super casual, quick sushi place.  When it comes down to it, I can't always afford to spend what that quantity of food would cost me at Yasu or any of the other great places in town - I like that I am not committing to a whole roll - I can sample from 5 or 6 different ones.  Fills the need for the sushi craving on a buget and/or when strapped for time."}
{"text":"Do not waste your time! We are big fans of the Teharu location in East Mesa but the Tempe location is terrible. We sat at a table on the opposite side from the bar. Apparently there are two separate conveyor belts because while the bar had fresh food our side had literally nothing. We were forced to order everything and wait which is not why you go to revolving sushi. Then, when my Philly Roll came out from the kitchen I noticed it was missing avocado. I asked the waiter why there was no avocado and he said that his manager had told the chefs to stop using avocado in any rolls because avocados are expensive!!! What?!? Worst dining experience in a long time."}
{"text":"One of my favorites. The food is average and the atmosphere is interesting but the price is unbeatable. If you want to eat sushi but dont want to feel the pain this is the place for you.  I suggest the dragon rolls, very good!"}
{"text":"Halfway decent food for a revolving sushi bar. My family and I happened to go in on the Tuesday after Christmas. We sat down at 2:30 and we're promptly told that they close at 3. Service was extremely poor, and dirty glasses. We felt rushed and pushed out of the door. I left three stars because we have been here before and had a more positive experience but still the food quality overall isn't anything special. Better sushi places nearby"}
{"text":"The sushi was okay. It was my first time at a sushi bar where the sushi travels to you on its own. I probably would've gone back for the sushi, but the level of customer service is 0. I had brought my friend a gift that he accidentally left behind. We literally went back an hour later to pick it up, but the staff said that they threw it out in the trash, and if we're still interested to find it then we should start digging in their garbage. Like, who dares to say such a thing in service industry? I will never step foot there again. That was my first and last time."}
{"text":"If you want sushi at your own pace and without telling the sushi chef what you want, then this place is it.  The quality I would say borders good to excellent. This is rather surprising in the fact that this is a conveyor belt styled sushi place. The price is very reasonable.  The staff cycles the dish frequently to keep the items fresh and cold. For a sushi connoisseur, there is nothing worse than warm or luke-cold sushi.  Selections are average in that, there are more rolled sushi as opposed to nigiri styled sushi.  I do hope the staff will provide ginger (gari), along with wassabi to all the patrons.   Finally, this is not a restaurant to hold your power meetings, but will accommodate groups, family style dining, in casual setting."}
{"text":"The sushi is delicious and the prices are wonderful! Very helpful staff, overall one of my favorite restaurants ever :)!"}
{"text":"This place is usually crowded no matter when it's lunch time or dinner. I wouldn't say this place is a top notch sushi location in the area, but for the price you pay and the finish-able portion of each plate - this restaurant can be a big competitor. Prices are marked by colors, and the waitstaff couldn't care more about you after drinks are brought."}
{"text":"Absolute garbage. I don't know what happened to this place but it's a sad, sad, sad excuse for a sushi place. Selection was better at 7-11, many plates going around the conveyor with no cover, raw fish going around and around, all dry and warm. Gross. Just gross. Hope I don't get sick."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!!! It is perfect for a quick bite of yummy sushi. Prices are great and I love the guys standing in front of you making the sushi for the revolving bar. I eat here about twice a week."}
{"text":"Me and my Fiancé use to come here all the time and loved it. But the last few times we were in there the service was terrible, the music they were playing was not music I want to listen to when I'm in a restaurant, and the decor needs an upgrade. We went last night and the table she sat us at had a piece of paper on it and said \"BROKEN\" I pointed it out and moved to the second table and that one was broken too! We left right away. They either need to clean it up and close it down! I'll never come to this location again."}
{"text":"Saw that it had finally opened! Not as big as the other location, but I feel as if the sushi is slightly better. The inside is very beautiful with the etched glass dividers and granite-y countertops. A great place to go for a cheap, quick lunch."}
{"text":"I like Teharu but you never know if most of the food has been sitting out for awhile or not so you have to really inspect it before you take it of the belt.   The times that the food was sitting out for too long I just ordered fresh sushi that wasn't on the conveyor belt like the teharu roll and the shaggy dog roll.   I have never had a bad rainbow roll from there fortunately.  The times I've went there when I had no issue with the food the sushi was great! Gyozas are perfect if they're still warm.   I can't think of what other rolls I get besides the California roll and crunch roll but I'm satisfied with the sushi I pick out."}
{"text":"Our family absolutely loves this place. My wife, teenage daughter and I can't eat more than $23 worth of sushi before being completely full. The staff will make things to order for you a no extra charge. It's just a great place. We go there about once a week. Prior to this place, I hadn't eaten sushi in months."}
{"text":"This is a nice place.  You can have a fun novelty meal without spending a lot of money.  Service was great and I was happy overall.  The sushi is pretty generic,  it tasted OK but it's nothing to make a special trip for.  We could taste the difference between the fresh stuff and the stuff that had been on the conveyer belt for awhile.  Nothing is \"old\" per se, but if you choose wisely from the newer items you'll end up with a better experience.  So...if your looking for novelty but don't want to spend a lot this place is worth a try.  If your looking for excellent sushi (and even a little novelty) and are willing to spend a little more go to the  Japanese steakhouse right across the parking lot..."}
{"text":"We really like this sushi chain. Thai particular store doesn't usually have a good selection on the bar, but they are willing to make whatever roll you want. For revolving sushi, Teharu is the best."}
{"text":"Decent, fast, revolving sushi, at a great price. I really liked the variety, they had some rolls I've never had, and quite a few with jalapeños! (yum). Service is non-existent, but I knew that going in, thanks to other reviews. Fortunately, not much service is required for self-serve sushi! We walked away full and happy, in less than 30 minutes."}
{"text":"My daughter and I came to Teharu Sushi for lunch on a Thursday. We arrived just after noon and it was half full. When we left, they had closed the west side of the conveyor so there were about 25 peeps waiting for a table.   Conveyor belt sushi is always a mixed bag.  It's the Winco of sushi, so you serve yourself but don't expect the quality stuff you get at your favorite place.  The draw for these is: you get to try different rolls for a minimal investment (about $2 per plate).  Between us we racked up 13 plates and it came to about $27 plus tip.   The service here is among the worst I've seen. You get your table, your drink and then the only sound you hear is the quiet hum of the conveyor going past your table. No service at all, unless they need your table, which they did.   Some of the better rolls, IMO: Philly, Tiger and Las Vegas."}
{"text":"i love love LOVE the revolving sushi concept ..... it's a small and very casual spot - good for lunch and dinner.  The chefs are definitely on top of making sure items do not just stick around for hours at a time .... I noticed that there are stickers on each lid, which must signify what time they put it out and when to take it off the conveyor.  When dealing with sushi, that's HUGE!!! Everything tasted delicious and they will take special requests :) Amazing prices --- you really can't beat a $1.50 roll!!!"}
{"text":"The sushi is still cheap, however I feel that their quality has been on the decline, while their other location is getting better and better."}
{"text":"This locations quality is now far superior to their tempe counterpart. Even down to the quality of their avocados. However I still would not get the soft crab roll here.  If I wasn't a regular here, I probably would not have returned based off the service of my last visit. The last time I went to this location I didn't not receive a wasabi tray, so I had to ask the sushi makers if they could give me one, because my server was running around so much. Furthermore, I didn't even get a glass of water. Thank goodness I brought my own water bottle, which I ended up having to share with my boyfriend. I think this was the first time in my life I tipped someone 2 dollars (on an 18 dollar tab) because of poor service, and I still though that that was too generous considering LITERALLY all he did was seat us and pass us our bill."}
{"text":"Met a friend who lives in the area and had never heard of this place nor had I ever been to a restaurant or sushi place with a conveyor belt.  The sushi is perhaps not world famous quality but I had no issues with it, and I can't say I'm a sushi snob just a sushi lover.  I don't know how often I'll be coming here because it's far from my house but definitely a different experience that I'd do again.  Much like Katie V. suggested it's fun to be able to visualize your sushi and pick and choose and see the plates just piling up. For some you get to feel like a competitive sushi eater...well maybe not but you know what I mean. The service is maybe lacking but if you like to try a little variation on your typical sushi meal this is definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Quick, easy-on-the-pocket-book and relatively fresh sushi (especially the salmon).  Can't beat it for a quick bite of sushi on the run.    I don't understand all the 3 stars.  This is not where you go to wine and dine your lady or expect white-table-cloth service.  This is where you go for a quick and easy fresh meal."}
{"text":"So good!! I liked picking out my own items as they came around on the conveyor belt. If you're not satisfied with the selection, you can always order rolls from the sushi bar. I didn't try any of the hot food items but I'm sure I will next time I visit."}
{"text":"I heard this was a decent place according to the reviews on yelp and from other people we knew.  I love sushi and love the concept of these types of places, so had to give it a try.  We came after the lunch rush hour so I was not sure how fresh the sushi would be but it was good and fresh.  The people were behind the counters were continually making fresh sushi, plus you could order off the menu.  I loved sitting at the counter to watch everyone make the food.  Service was a little slow (had to flag waitress down for a refill on drink).   I will be back."}
{"text":"Cliff notes - Cheap: $1-2/plate - Fast: It's ready-to-go and on a conveyor - Acceptable quality: I'm here weekly and haven't gotten sick lol  This place is definitely good for what it is, \"it\" being a budget-friendly sushi place that's great for a quick bite.  In a response to the lower-rating reviews stating how the food is just okay at best or authentic or blah blah blah, well think of it like wal-mart vs. *inserthighendretailerhere*.  This place has a business model based on selling in large volumes (hence the low prices like wal-mart) so they're gonna have to \"reduce costs\" somehow (so-so quality food, not-so-attentive staff, and slightly smaller than average portions), but it's still a solid bang-for-your-buck kinda place.  On top of this, I can be in and out quickly since everything is already prepared, perfect for those quick 30 min lunch breaks.  All that's required is for you to grab it off the conveyor (depending on whether or not all the items you want are on the conveyor at the time).   I've never had issues with seating, but do not make a point to go during peak hours and usually go with a small party (2-4 people).  For those claiming to be \"left to fend for themselves\" due to an inattentive staff, most of your sushi-related inquiries can be answered by this thing called \"the menu\" that sits on the counters.  See, this miraculous piece of technology contains things referred to as \"descriptions\" on them that help to inform you about the sushi going round-and-round before you.  Furthermore, there's even a pricing guide based on the color code of the plates to assist you further! WOW! Lol wtf do people expect for $1-2 plates of sushi?  Someone to hold your hand? LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL DIAF  And the cherry on top? $4 large japanese beers and $5 sake bombs! HELL YEAH!"}
{"text":"Great cheap sushi.  I like to go for a late lunch early dinner 3:00 pm not crowded easy to get special orders like the spider roll and yellow tail."}
{"text":"Have to admit, was really reticent going in - I even asked the host if it was 'okay', and he laughed. That was a couple of months ago and I find myself here regularly. It's a lot of imitation crab meat variations in the rolls, but they do have really decent spicy tuna, tempura rolls, nigiri, really good gyoza and other tasty combo rolls. They also have a more complete sushi menu with things that they don't put on the merry-go-round - like soft-shell crab, hand rolls and other specialty things. Granted it's not super high-end product, but it's pretty dang good and at great prices - $10 and you are stuffed. Best part, it comes to you on the conveyer belt. Pretty fun - great cheap date night.   Go - just not on the nights I do, so I can get seats."}
{"text":"Can't beat it for the price and is fun, too with the conveyor belt!"}
{"text":"Sushi is cut SOOOOOOO thin. About a 1/3 normal fish slice. We asked hostess if they had sushi with NO RICE with the seaweed paper. She said yes and guess what? NONE. If you actually want more than just rice, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is cheap and quick, filled up for about 15 - 20 dollars and thats dirt cheap for sushi. But on the other hand i filled up for about 15 - 20 dollars and thats dirt cheap for sushi. Just know what your getting into."}
{"text":"I'm very picky about food, sushi especially. When co-workers told me about this place, I wasn't so sure but checked it out one day with a bunch of them. So glad I did! It's probably one of the better, and def most reasonably priced sushi places around. I don't eat seaweed wraps, and even ordering special rolls with soy paper, I can usually get 8 plates and spend less than $25! They have a great selection and the conveyor belt bringing everything around makes it so easy to just pick and eat! It gets busy at lunch, but there's plenty of seating. Service can be slow, but because most people help themselves they usually don't have a large staff, just be patient and you can always flag someone down (please be polite!)."}
{"text":"Great fresh sushi,for a fantastic price. We go at least twice a month for lunch. Many rolls to choose from. You just can't beat it for the price. You also can't forget how fun the revolving conver belt...YUM!"}
{"text":"First, I think it's important to know that I am not a huge fan of sushi.  Oh, I go all the time, but it's because I like the camaraderie and the saki....ok, mostly the saki.  That being said, I loved the sushi here.    The place is cute and clean, and the conveyor is just fun. I love that the plates usually consist of 4 rolls - that way I can feel like I can try something new without over committing.  The color coding helps us keep track of about how much we are spending too.  The service is friendly, and the beer is cheap, overall, it's a great place even for those like me who are not totally enamored of sushi."}
{"text":"Friends from NYC came into town and wanted to try Teharu Sushi. First off, I HATE sushi...but that's okay. I figured they'd have other items on the menu. We were seated and our waiter took forever. Finally I'm ready to order and was informed that Egg rolls are no longer available but are listed on the menu since he started working over a year ago. No Egg rolls? Dang Yo! We just chilled and enjoyed a great conversation and waited to eat somewhere else. I hope to never see this place again."}
{"text":"This is a 3.5 star rating...(yelp staff please have half stars for reviews!!)  Fun concept of food circulating around your table, having everything from sushi to various beverages to little side dishes (cucumber salad, squid salad, cheesecake??). +fun music playing...We walked in and there was a dubstep track on...yesss +concept of the various rolls and food revolving around the place +prices! holy batman everything was $1-$2...between two (very hungry) people we spent $28 on nearly a dozen small plates with beer and a small sake (had to drive...booo that) +servers were very nice and attentive if we wanted any particular rolls so they could grab them or make them for us -the fish in the sushi doesn't taste the best, it's a notch above grocery store...but some grocery stores have great sushi though!  I mean, AZ is land-locked so I can't expect SF or LA fresh sushi  Overall, I'll be back...and with my appetite"}
{"text":"If you want no frills and cheap, this is the spot. It's clean and affordable because the most expensive dish on the conveyor belt is $4. Staff is always happy, accommodating and attentive to your needs. I did not try their regular menu items but I prefer the bar because it's just fun and well, I can eat quickly while getting entertainment from good conversation and endless supply of sushi!"}
{"text":"Tired of the good ol' boy type places that the vendors keep picking, I used the Yelp! for Blackberry app to find this place just around the corner from where I was working today.  We had to wait a few minutes for a table to open up, but as soon as one did, I reached for the Spicy Tuna (not that spicy).  I also grabbed the cucumber salad (more sweet than tang, reminding me of my grandmothers bread and butter pickles), the seaweed salad, the rainbow roll (decent fish, but the avocado was dried out), the maguro (far more pink than red...), the salmon (a little on the slimy side, but it didn't smell or taste funny, just weird texture), and tried, at the behest of my less sushi experienced colleagues, the baked scallops on top of a california roll (just plain weird - the top was a combination of crab and baked scallops with some cream sauce, which I'm still tasting now, 4 hours later...).    This was the first conveyor belt sushi place that I've been to in the US, but I knew that just like all sushi in the US, it wouldn't be as good as what I'd had in Japan.  Even considering, I don't think I'll be recommending this place to the rest of the team in the future.  This is a good place to introduce people to sushi, and it's cheap, and fast (once you have a table), but if you've been to Japan and had the real thing, this Americanized version just won't cut it."}
{"text":"Color me impressed.  Given the quality of sushi restaurants in the greater Valley area, I was worried about conveyor belt sushi here. I mean, if they can't make it right in the kitchen, how is it gonna be on a roving belt?  My worries were for naught.  Despite the 30 minute wait on a Tuesday night at 7:45pm (yes, it was that crowded), and having trouble finding it (there is no sign from the street -- you HAVE to know where it is), it was all worth it.  My companions (all fish eaters but me) LOVED it. They said the fish was fresh, delicious, exciting etc. I loved the seaweed salad and edamame to start, and then went for two dishes of Inari, a place of veggie rolls, and then wound up ordering 3 orders (so a total of 12 individual) avocado rolls, because none were coming around.  All that, plus iced tea, cost me $16.  AMAZING.  My partner ate all sorts of rolls; her favorite was the I Love Salmon Roll and also the Caterpillar Roll, although she enjoyed the Rainbow Roll and Dragon Rolls as well.  Wasn't impressed with the Las Vegas Roll, and wished that they had more exciting, different, unique rolls (they had one; the Haru Sushi, which she did enjoy).  Her total, with iced tea? $18. Seriously. Oh, and we shared a place of cream puffs for dessert.  There were no plates more than $2. The cheesecake had two $2 plates, making it 4, but other than that, nothing, including special orders, was more than $2.  The avocado rolls I had were some of the best I've enjoyed (they were bursting full of avocado, instead of one small piece), and the Inari was delicious. Ginger on the table (as well as unagi sauce and soy sauce), quick to fill up iced tea. I was in heaven.  I do wish they'd have more vegetarian rolls so I didn't have to order them. The whole time we were there, only one veggie roll went by - the one I ate.  No cucumber, avocado, daikon, etc unless you ordered them. I also wish Wasabi was on the table, instead of brought to you in a hunk; I didn't want to use it all at once, but I had to take it out of my dish to save for later and put...where?  Also, I loved the \"other\" options, like juice, V8, Ramun (Japanese soda), pudding cups, fruit, cheesecake and more on the belt. Gave lots of options.  It did take forever to get our bill, but all that aside, we will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Sake bombs and mackerel. The great price and great location make it a good spot for me to start at before my night out on most weekends. Try to get in early or plan on waiting a little because they get packed really quickly. Not the best sushi I've ever had by any means but I don't remember a time being disappointed at the quality or freshness. They have a variety of the popular rolls people love and some originals that are great as well."}
{"text":"Great sushi and friendly servers! If you plan to go there for a weekday lunch, plan to get there at 11 as they fill up quickly!"}
{"text":"The concept of a rotating sushi bar is fun, but the quality of sushi was lacking. For the price you pay, though, you can't expect much more. What was a little alarming was the rude service and the fly that came out of the soy sauce."}
{"text":"Customer service was pretty iffy, as others have reported. The staff was super friendly, just very absent from my experience. I'm not an expert with sushi, in fact I'm the opposite! I don't even really like sushi, but thought my 3 year old son would enjoy the train style belt!   He did in deed. But I had to wing it from there. I didn't get a menu, which I noticed later another table had one...that would have been helpful.   I grabbed Gyoza first, because I love them! They were warm at best. That made me a little less daring moving forward.  I liked the Volcano Roll, and Spicy Tuna Roll was good. My son had the kids teriyaki, which I only knew existed because a buddy had told me his son likes that.   So, I guess a middle of the road rating for a middle of the road experience and food. Lots of good food accessible from the exact same parking spot, I don't think I'll probably be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Sushi should be made to order, not picked from random containers. Do you know how long the sushi has been on the train? Why are so many people excited about this poor idea? Call me old fashioned, but I like traditional sushi bars. It's just average sushi, which can be had at lots of places."}
{"text":"Awful, awful, awful service. Tables sit dirty forever (gross!) while they make customers wait. Drink orders not taken or refilled. We went there at close to 8pm and the very limited selection of sushi looked *really* old.  I get that they might not want to fill up the belt later in the evening - but if that is the case then come to our table and ask what we would like to eat for crying out loud.  Because we did come there, after all, to eat food.  We left hungry and stopped elsewhere to get some food in the way home.  It appears that front of the house is run by an 18 year old who doesn't have the slightest idea of what she is doing. And she is really rude. Suggest they invest in a real manager."}
{"text":"Came to this place by a fluke. Was gonna go to the spot next door, but they were closed for the Super Bowl, so sushi it is.   Service was ok, but I didn't appreciate ice water being spilled all over my 7 month old son. Also, the little plates of sushi have lids on em. I understand you need the colored plates to figure out what to charge, but do we need the lids cluttering up the table? We don't need a bunch of trash all over the table. Take this away!  Sushi quality was fine. Not the best, not the worst. The price is very reasonable for the quality, so I was happy with that. Also, though it was weekend lunch time, and there were some customers, it was fairly quiet which was great.  Overall, if you're looking for a quick sushi fix for a reasonable price, this is a decent choice."}
{"text":"I continue to give this place my business over 4 years and  I have stopped eating in because the service is garbage. I have been getting Togo but today will be my last time; literally my food is sitting there ready and server walk past several times I actually ended up grabbing my food and leaving! This place is crap the seating is ridiculous when eating in they won't even open the other side no matter how many people are waiting! Save your money and go else where!!"}
{"text":"I would give no stars if I could. Waitress was awful and rude. Repeatedly snatched order form from my hand. Conveyor belt stopped worked they didn't say anything just let us sit here waiting. Awful awful service. I stopped coming here for a reason. I will never be back and I won't be leaving a tip!"}
{"text":"Let's face the facts that sushi can be expensive, especially if your kids are sushi lovers! THANK GOODNESS for Teharu Sushi!!! Awesome, awesome, awesome place to come with kids or without your kids. Love the selection of different sushi, sashimi and other items found on their kitchen menu (ask for their kitchen menu, they don't always place it on the table.)   Awesome prices, great customer service!  We heart this place!!!!! It can get busy so make sure to arrive on time!"}
{"text":"Novelty kind of place. Fun for kids or beginners. Tons of Cali type rolls but little substance. Service is poor and end up waiting to get the conveyor belt loaded if your not sitting right at the bar. Just not impressed. If you know your sushi and like grade a fish don't come here."}
{"text":"May I start by saying I have never been yelled at by someone who is was supposed to be waiting on me until I ate at Teharu Tempe. I have eaten here previously and had an an enjoyable experience, but today my wife and I went to this location for lunch and I have never had such  appaling service. We were told to sit at the sushi bar and asked for a table because I am in a walking boot and the sushi bar was an uncomfortable fit. One server told us to sit and wait for the table. Another then asked if he could help us, and when we explained we were waiting for a table he went to confirm with the first server. Then a third server (I assume she was their boss by the way she sopke to them) told my wife there was no table for us and \"You sit here!\" In a loud commanding tone pointing to the sushi bar. My wife and I were absolutely stunned at her rudeness payed for the 2 plates we ate, and left. If Teharu is your jam, head to the Scottsdale location for better service and fresher fish."}
{"text":"This is a great sushi place! My husband, daughter and I went today and sat at the revolving sushi bar. Everything is labeled, so you know what's coming. My favorites were the Las Vegas  roll, Shaggy Dog and spicy tuna roll.  Also, the Haru Poppers are awesome!!!! My daughter had an amazing carrot cake dessert. Between the 3 of us, the bill was $25! Lots of great sushi to try, made fresh right in front of you and VERY REASONABLE!!! We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"It's a great place for inexpensive sushi and it's super fresh!  The place is always packed!  Service is pretty quick and they cater to gluten free people as well."}
{"text":"Teharu was great. Love the revolving sushi options. The service could be a little better, we had to wait a long time to receive our check. Other than that everything else was good. I recommend the Haru Sushi - so good!"}
{"text":"Having lived in LA for quite some time, I confess I'm very spoiled when it comes to sushi. So, here we are in the desert and craving some raw fish.Hmm.   Teharu is decent nothing more, nothing less.Nothing will make you sit back and go OMG this yellowtail just melted in my mouth its soooo fresh, but then again, few places will.  Its fast, cheap and fun to see the sushi rolls come zooming out on a conveyor belt.  The plates are all color coded, with different colors meaning different prices[ie blue-2]  If you want something extra fresh ,simply order it.  A word of warning- friday night, or saturday night?You are in for a loooong wait, and it gets -very- loud, with K pop blasting from the speakers at pop your eardrum volume.A romantic date place, this is not.A quick way to get your sushi fix and not be sick for days?Yep.  I'm quite fond of this place, and my teen son LOVES it."}
{"text":"Way better than the Tempe location; quiet, not packed to the rafters, I could actually hear what my companion was saying to me, no k-pop screaming !   Food was ok- perfect for a quick sushi fix, but its not gourmet or especially creative; some of the rolls -did- taste warm, I have to admit that previous reviewers were correct with this observation. Hmmm. it was STILL way way better than the Tempe location. The rolls are tiny, but the fish -seems- fresh- I did not catch a whiff of anything gross, and with fish, it would be very easy to smell if something was off. Chefs seemed focused and speedy.  Service was non existent- I refuse to tip well here as we did not get a refill of water, she forgot the wasabi, the ginger, the soy sauce etc etc.Good Lord, get it together."}
{"text":"The food is always great when I come here. However, there mechanism for seating customers is lack luster. Seats will be open for 10 minutes or so and they will still wait to seat people."}
{"text":"This place is nicer than the Tempe location.  Super easy and fun and quick and sooooo cheap.  Me and two kids stuffed our faces with as much sushi, desserts, edamame, pot stickers, etc until we were full and the bill was $20."}
{"text":"Good day to all of you. I have been eating here for years since it opened. I admit that I have had a few days I have come that they are busy and have had to wait a few minutes , however I have never had bad food here if any I have had some of the best tasting sushi especially for the price. I think that as a small business owner that there are way to many people ready to give businesses a bad review, when the service isn't quite such a perfect experience that they expect. I have been at this place enough to know that the food is great for the price and the service isn't top notch but they don't have to do much as YOU serve yourself.How much do you think the waitresses need to jump when you do that. I wonder about people sometimes!!!"}
{"text":"We normally come here once a week. Especially after I get off work for a end of the week treat. Over the past couple of months we have seen the customer service go down as the popularity of the place went up.  During the week, there are not as many choices on the belt and you will have to ask for sushi (which isn't a big deal except for the slow service). On the  weekends there are many choices on the belt but the service is EXTREMELY poor. As I sit writing this yelp I have had to ask for assistance from multiple different waitresses (THREE) only to have one actually acknowledge my request and remember to come back. I didn't have my drink refilled once, even after asking... and when I would ask for assistance one waitress she sighed and then asked me what I want...like it was an inconvenience. I'm sorry, but this is your job if you don't want to serve people don't be in the business.   When people ask me for waters, even when it's not my job in the hospital I never sigh or make it known it is not my job I smile and do what is requested because that is customer service. The waiting staff needs to realize this as well."}
{"text":"Are you craving sushi and sashimi and are on a budget? Look no further and try this place. The plates from the conveyer belt range from $1-$4 each. Me and my brother left with a bill of $15.00 and I ate until I was full. Another friend who went with us had a $8.00 bill. They have iced green tea which I enjoyed. And the service was great our waitresses and waiter consistently checked on us and  frequently provided refills to us. I don't see what the big complaints about the place are. I would try this place again."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years. Good sushi at an affordable price but expect horrible service. Called in for take out and a new girl forgot to turn in my food order. I arrived half an hour after my call even though she told me it would only take 20 minutes and they didn't even start on my food yet. The staff makes me question whether or not I will be back."}
{"text":"The sushi is great! Not expensive & good quality.  My favorite rolles are the Vegas, Dragon, and the baked scallops :)"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! Great all around... Service - Fantastic and super friendly.  FUN- it was my first time to a conveyor belt sushi place so I was like a kid in a candy store for the first time!  We also had sake bombers - only $5 but the sake was a little bottle not a large one like at many places. Cucumber salad was delish! and sushi all around was yummy!  Here's the kicker... eat dish is on a different colored plate - yellow $1, green $1.50, blue $2.00...  they do have a menu you can order off of and also send misc. things down the belt too... deserts, pudding cups, fruit cups, juice boxes...  We got there early... before 5pm... and that place gets rockin!  not a ton of seating so get there early as long as you get a seat... from what I could tell... there's not a bad seat in the house!  We will definitely bring our friends and family back there for more fun!"}
{"text":"The service is terrible and food isn't much better.   We had ordered tuna and salmon nigiri and salmon skin rolls. We received the tuna and salmon nigiri since they were raw but we had waited 20 or 30 minutes for the salmon skin rolls. We heard a ding from one of the toaster ovens and thought it was our food but no rolls came to our table for another 5 minutes.  None of the chefs checked that oven to see what was inside.  We asked the waiter,  who never checked on the table that was just sitting there waiting,  and she had asked the chefs if they had any of the rolls started.  They said no and said they lost our ticket. We just got the check but on the way out,  I finally saw that the chef had taken out the stuff in that oven and started making the rolls. We waited so long for nothing and the food was pretty much already done.  It just took one of the three chefs to check on that oven. An apology would've been nice too since we wasted our time waiting.   None of the waiters offered to help us and we had to flag them towards our table all the time. We have been there quite a few times,  but it seems to have worsened over the years."}
{"text":"This is my go to when I want sushi on the cheap. The wait during rush times can get crazy but it isn't too bad. For top rolls definitely get their las vegas roll fresh out of the oven or the baked scallop roll. Their philly roll is pretty decent as well. They do have a menu you can order from which is great for those kids who are picky eaters. They even have chocolate milk and fruit cups for them. You can make reservations just do it a good amount of time in advance. The service can be slow sometimes so it's great that you can serve yourself. Just grab a plate and once your done stack them. Make sure you flag down an employee when you want your bill. This place also makes it easy to seperate bills at the table. If you want rolls fast just ask the sushi chefs when you can since most of the time you sit in front of them. Overall just test out as many rolls as you want because it's cheap and not so bad.  Just not top quality"}
{"text":"The food was OK, wasn't the most amazing but I'm confident I wont get sick.  The staff was friendly but inefficient making it super difficult to actually get a drink in a timely manner.  The atmosphere was a little weird and the iced tea Tupperware was just silly.  Come on, you can't do better than rubbermaid?  For the price, there are worse choices, but I'd rather spend a little more to really be happy with my food.  I'm just not a starving student anymore."}
{"text":"This place used to be so awesome but the last year or so it has steadily gone down hill. It seems as though most of the servers are still here, as well as some of the \"cooks.\" If you ask for anything special like you would at a normal sushi resturant they have a bad attitude. If there is a dish that is supposed to be warm and u ask for a fresh one they grab it off the conveyor belt. The last few times they have produced so much of the food that way it can last for two or three hours... it's sushi and it's supposed to be fresh..."}
{"text":"Where to start? The conveyor belt idea is definitely a plus and I miss sushi boats/conveyor belts from the east coast. The sushi selection is more on the limited side; however, I was pleasantly surprised of how fresh the yellowtail and the octopus was. The food was a good solid 3.5 stars. . . . so why barely 3 stars?   SERVICE sucks! Perhaps I may have internalized resentment growing up in a Korean American community and experiencing various Korean owned and serviced restaurants, but damn these people had no shame. I made a reservation at 7:00 pm and they seemed to be clueless of my reservation. They repetitively asked my name and I answered as patiently as I could. Now the repetivive question was not due to a language barrier but I swear they seemed like they were hoping WE made the mistake. Even after we were seated, they continued to question what my name was and if my reservation was for a certain time. We felt like they were going to take away our seats even after being seated because of their persistent questioning with 2 different servers taking their turn interrogating us. Not to mention, the spilled soy sauce that we almost slipped on near our table.   So on average, I gave Teharu 3 stars. I am hoping for better service in my future visits. Good sushi, excellent price, but poor service."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here about 2 and a half years ago, and I still come here often: the sushi is great, not dry like the stuff you'd get in the grocery store, and it tastes just as good if not better than overpriced sushi joints. The sushi on the conveyer belt is priced by plate color, ranging from I believe $1-$3. The service has always been good too; you get seated pretty quickly and get served your drinks, then they'll revisit for refills; otherwise you have to wave them down for the check. Otherwise it's a pretty laid back and nice atmosphere, and a good & inexpensive place to go that I like to frequent."}
{"text":"Great sushi at a great price!!!  Whenever I have the craving but don't have a lot to spend I come here and eat my heart out and never leave over $30 for two!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant off and on for a while, and although service has always been mediocre at best, I didn't care. It was part of the unspoken agreement: you sell me decent salmon nigiri for $1.50 a plate, and I overlook the fact that the male servers always make me feel like I'm inconveniencing them by trying to eat here and that half the things I order never actually make it to my table. But it turns out there is a limit to what I'll endure for cheap and fast sushi after all.   I arrived at 8:30 on a Saturday night and was largely ignored, which was pretty much par for the course. What irritated me this time in particular was that about 15 minutes in, I finally had to get up and get an order sheet for myself because the servers were painstakingly avoiding eye contact with the customers at all costs. To add insult to injury, they started clearing tables. I had to I guess we looked like we weren't going to use any? I assumed they were about to close, but then discovered that they were in fact open until 10:30.  Long story short, if you really like California rolls and don't mind being treated like crap, this is probably an excellent restaurant for a casual dinner with people you don't mind sitting around, not eating with."}
{"text":"If you are a real sushi eater, pass on this place. It's totally cheap, but you get what you pay for. Portions are small and fish quality is cheap.  - but would you expect a Big Mac to be made of USDA Prime Beef? At lunch the conveyor belt is half full compared to dinner.  This place has gone way downhill since opening. You can order a la carte items, but if you're going to do that just go to a regular sushi bar and skip the conveyor belt gimmick."}
{"text":"On the upside this place is a great concept and VERY reasonably priced! On the downside the atmosphere isn't the best, they should try dimming the lights and adding more decor. Also the service was good but the waitress kept bothering my group by trying to take condiments (eel sauce, ginger) off our table before we were done with them when there was plenty more on other tables. The waitress also handed us our bill and then stood right behind us staring at us as we looked over the bill and got our payment ready... who does that?! I am definitely going to give this place another try because I do understand they are just starting out and because the price was right for the experience"}
{"text":"Really can't say anything bad...I am a sushi lover and loved this place! I loved the rotating sushi wheel and how you can pick out what you want or order from the menu that isn't sushi, so there's something for everyone. Everything I tasted was good. Even the people next to us were enjoying their meal. Great place-will return"}
{"text":"Was not a fan of the sushi, most of it was not fresh and pretty gross. Wouldn't go back here again."}
{"text":"I enjoyed dining here.   While the restaurant keeps busy and the wait can go on and on, the conveyor belt means immediate orders arrive instantly at your table. But, yeah, people came in groups! I was surprised at the number of large parties, which is just as well. Teharu, in addition to sushi bar seating, is mostly table and booth seating.   As for the food, I found that the fish was fresh and the rice was decent. My favorites were the mackerel and salmon nigiri. But, sadly, I did not overly enjoy the rolls. They were not bland, but they also were not overly flavorful. Also, the wine selection is very short and also not very interesting.   But, in all, a very good price for dinner."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed by this place. I usually love revolving sushi bars but this place really let me down.   First, when we arrived (there were 5 of us), they ushered us to a table that was too small despite having plenty of tables that could fit us. Once we were sat, a server didn't come by to get us drinks or let us order off the menu for over half an hour. When the server did come by, it took him another 15 minutes to get our drinks, half of which he forgot. He also never brought the food that we ordered off the menu, and gave us a hard time when we wanted it taken off the bill since we never received it.   As for the revolving sushi itself, I'm not sure if we were there at an off time or what, but there was only like five or six things to choose from, all of which tasted pretty sub-par. One sushi roll (the caterpillar roll) had three or fours little hairs in it, which was really off-putting for me. Like I said, I don't know if it was just an off time, but it wasn't good for us at all. It tasted very poor quality, and I honestly like the sushi from the grocery store more. The server also neglected to bring us additional eel sauce.    It is pretty inexpensive, but for the service and quality we received, it still wasn't worth it. I really wanted to like this place but I just couldn't. I am hoping it was just an off night for them and that this isn't the standard.   Personally, I would not recommend this place - you're better off with grocery store sushi."}
{"text":"I frequent this place often, they have pretty good sushi and the kids love the novelty of \"revolving\" sushi. It's a fun experience. The sushi is usually pretty good and I love that you can request whatever type of roll you like and they will make it upon request. However yesterday the service was junk. We went at 4pm, not a very busy time. Our server took a good 10 mins to bring us soy dishes and chopsticks. She brought a water for my but we waited another 5 mins for her to bring water for my 3 kids. She was chatting it up with the other servers, laughing and standing around. The sushi chefs were kind enough to refill our waters and give me the spicy mayo I had asked for twice. It was very irritating, the service makes me not want to go back. But the sweet sushi chefs and cheap prices will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"This is interactive eating. Good sushi. I recommend eating here. Its good shit, why does Yelp want me to write a fucking novel?"}
{"text":"For a rotating sushi bar this place is pretty good, but the sushi is definitely not as high quality as other places around here. I never know how long certain items have been sitting so that always sketches me out. But like I said, it's good for what it is."}
{"text":"First off let me say I am a big fan of sushi and eat it all the time.  A year ago or so when this moved into the area I was not sure what to expect, I mean sushi + conveyor belt = not sure.  I was presently surprised by the quality, which I would attribute to how quickly the turn it out they have the buying power due to quantity I guess.  Given its not a high end sushi place but for the price and the speed its a great place for lunch for a busy professional.  I am a big salmon fan so that's the way I judge a place and they have good salmon.  I am able to get in and out in 15 min for about $8-11 full of good sushi and get back to work.    Here are a couple of things I have found frequenting the place over the last year or so.  Arrive early 11:30ish so you don't have to wait (noon you will have a wait and parking is a nightmare at that complex).  Also this means all the sushi is freshly cut and prepared.   Avoid using conveyor belt mid afternoon or late lunch just order from the bar and they will prepare fresh.  All and all I love this place and would recommend it to any sushi loving busy professional.    There are a couple of things that need to be improved although they don't keep me from going there at least once a week and probably after this review because now I am craving it.  Staffing needs to be increased especially on Fridays it gets hectic.  This would improve the experience and also allow them to turn tables faster as lots of days I am there an extra 5 min with people waiting for my spot because the staff is running around and cant close me out.  This will help with wait times also.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick, pop-in, pop-out sushi place that will fill your stomach without emptying your wallet, Teharu is your spot. The center of the restaurant is the primary food preparation area, surrounded by a constantly-moving conveyor belt filled with tasty food! The plates are yellow(ish tan), green and blue, and the color of your plate corresponds to the price of the item upon it ($1, $1.50 or $2/plate). They offer a variety of both cooked and raw rolls, along with other items like gyoza, cucumber salad and desserts. Because everything is ready as soon as you arrive, Teharu is convenient, though as anticipated for $1-$3 per item, the quality is pretty middle of the road. That said, it's still A-OK, and it won't break the bank!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The sushi is great.  The prices are amazingly affordable. Example California crunch roll 4 pieces 1.50. The only thing that's 3 bucks is the cheese cake. The only thing I would improve about this place is the service you may wait a bit to get the check."}
{"text":"Never again. The service was the worst. Had to ask for things at least three times. But the worst was the fact that the sushi looked old and unappetizing. Plus the hot things were cold and cold things were hot. Don't go."}
{"text":"So sad!! So so many fruit flies I'm guessing. Landing on our food. I then went to pay my bill after the manager saw the dead one on my plate. She just quickly picked it up and told me that the entire strip has them and that there is nothing she can do?"}
{"text":"Everyone on here giving a negative review needs to get a grip. Who cares if the waitresses aren't fluent in English?! It's a cheap sushi bar, and great! You can't expect gourmet rolls for $1.50 a plate.....but they taste just as good at RA or anywhere else! Best date night place because it's so cheap and fun! You can also order rolls that you don't see on the conveyer. Cool 2003-2009 yrs. music is always playing too. Super catchy fun ambiance!"}
{"text":"I hate getting home from a trip, waiting at the baggage return to pick up a suit case full of smelly clothing. For some reason I love the same concept when it involves waiting around a conveyor for a plate of raw fish.  Walk in, and sign up.  This is smart eliminating the need for a hostess that does little.  Get to your seat tell then what you want to drink and start looking at the plates. From what I saw most nigiri is $1 or $1.50 for two pieces. They are a bit smaller that normal ngiri. The Quality was decent Not great or gourmet but not bad or scary like you may think $1 sushi is.   Rolls come in 4's (spicy tuna $1.50) and fancy 4s  (Hawaii roll $2) plates.  I really enjoyed the Hawaii roll which is just a spicy tuna roll plus tuna on top and a siricha and mayo mix.  Part of the fun is watching everything go by and wondering what will be next.  The best spots will be near the cooking area as you get first pick at the plates.  We go here early at 5:15 on a rainy weeknight and it was busy so, worries about general fish freshness can be avoided.  However I do wonder how they keep track of less popular items,  like the squid salad or mackerel. The whole hour we were here I think I saw the same plates make over 10 lonely trips around.  I did learn that you can ask the cooks in the center for special orders too if you don't see what you want, however I did not test this.  They also have non sushi items making their way around, from edamame, cream puffs, cheese cake, Asian drinks, pudding cups and some jalapeno popper concoction.  If you want a fun cheaper sushi meal give this place a try. Its not the best sushi but its fun cheap and unique for Arizona.   3.5 stars if I were allowed FYI  In the end they add up the plates and you pay. hooray, I am not sure how to tip at a place like this."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Sunday evening. The place was busy but we were seated within an appropriate amount of time. I ordered avocado rolls, and the rice unfortunately did not taste good, and the avocados seemed old. Not really a place to go to for quality rolls. Great place if you are looking for a cheap meal."}
{"text":"I come here often and I have visited other revolving restaurants.. This one is still my favorite there is a wait most days but once you sit down everything is quick and multiple waitresses and waiters attend to you. It's a great deal for ok sushi.."}
{"text":"You get exactly what you pay for when you dine here - no more, no less. And that's the beauty of Teharu sushi. It is perfect for that sushi fix when you don't care for super high quality. Plus once you are seated (there's a wait during peak hours but is a steady flow), you just grab your plates and dig right in. This has been our go-to for years and will continue to be. What's more fun than your sushi rolling right in front of you, ready to eat for no more than $3? Not much. Oh and this little detail may be small to others but I truly appreciate the bottles of unagi/eel sauce available at the bar for us who like sweet instead of salty soy sauce. I always have to ask for eel sauce at all other sushi joints. There is also unlimited pickled ginger at the bar/tables for your ginger lovers."}
{"text":"Not the best sushi ever, but pretty good for the price. It's quick and very affordable. I like how everything is color coded so you know how much you're racking up. Dinner for two for less than $20. Awesome."}
{"text":"I had so much fun here! Little food goes around in circles in front of you and no matter how much shit you grab, your bill ends up being like $8.  Okay that was an exaggeration. Maybe $12.   I can see how the strongest arguments for a place like this would be price and convenience.  I'm an asshole so I look at it as a type of \"Competitive Eating\" environment where we are all racing to see who can make the highest plate tower. I realize I'm given a substantial advantage being as I'm the only who even knows the contest is going on, but it's still a challenge. What can I say? I enjoy challenging myself. It says so on my resume. But I digress.  The food is okay. The nigiri is thin, but it's also $1 for two pieces, so I'm not going to complain. The rolls are basic but tasty. You only get 4 pieces on the plate, which is good for just one or two people because you can try stuff without committing to a whole roll. It's basically Sushi for Beginners rolling around on the conveyor belt and though I hear that you can special request things I haven't tried to do so yet. The highest priced plate is $2 so I'm not even sure something like Uni or Ikura is an option, though it would rock my world up if it was.  Another fun thing about the belt is that it's not all sushi! During my visit there were little bags of trail mix, pieces of cheesecake, a can of V8 (wtf?), and little Japanese sodas all circling around, waiting to get picked up. I like this concept and feel it should be expanded to include shots, beers, Yoo-Hoos and those Lik-M-Aid things the ice cream man used to sell. Those things were so good.  All in all, the food probably won't blow you away but it's fun and funny and you feel like you put one over on everyone when you eat 10 plates of sushi and your bill is only $13.50 including the can of V8. A-OK!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: so I decided to give them one more chance. This was a mistake. The very same disinterested and lukewarm reception as the last time, and there is still no excuse. They were not busy. Not even going to bother giving them a third chance."}
{"text":"We've been to Sushi-eye and HATED it. We found this place and MUCH BETTER.   They had way more variety of sushi, the belt was very very long and for every seating in that place, had tables for bigger groups so smaller groups (1-3) were able to sit at the bar.   The prices were much more reasonable that the aforementioned place.   We will definitely go back when we want rotating sushi.   I only wish that they had at least one or two oriental sushi chefs. Nothing against hispanic sushi chefs, but it's always a plus on the ambience and experience if there is an asian sushi chef. It was a friday night, so I'm guessing they don't have any.   I wish the wait staff was a bit more attentive - Our waitress had the habit of not refilling our teas unless our cups were bone-dry. Also, I wish they would keep tally for each of their tables by taking away the pile of plates every now and then. The tower of plates resulted in my spilling my drink."}
{"text":"I frequent Teharu a lot, but primarily only because it's the only conveyor belt sushi even close to where I live. In my opinion, the location by the Ikea in Tempe is slightly better (note: not all the plates are priced the same), although both are on the same tier. It's definitely not bad, especially since Arizona isn't exactly the hub of sushi restaurants, but there are so many better places elsewhere."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places in Scottsdale. It is conveyer belt style and they only serve a limited amount of sushi at a time on the belt so it is definitely fresh. The plates are small-you get about 4 pieces of sushi on each plate and the plates range from $1.00-$2.00 each. I have brought several friends & family members here and they all love it."}
{"text":"So happy that this opened in my neighborhood!! Minimally decorated space with a large sushi bar and a few booths. It was very busy at lunch but moved smoothly. The sushi was replenished regularly. Everything tasted quite fresh. There was a nice variety of rolls (caterpillar, Vegas, Dragon) and nigiri with very fresh tasting fish. The staff was very pleasant and attentive. The price was fantastic. The plates range from $1 to $2. Loved that the plates all had clear plastic covers."}
{"text":"Before I left Arizona, I was recommended by a friend to try this place out. The staff were very friendly, and kept checking back every now and then. Reason I gave this three stars was because the sushi dishes weren't fresh. I can understand considering they were sitting on the conveyer belt for at least an hour before we arrived. It was still good to eat, but I recommend coming when they open. Fresher the better. Other than that, their $3 Mochi was delicious. They give you two and cut them into fourths."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi place in the valley as the sushi is pretty good for the value. It's always clean and my group at work comes regularly on Fridays."}
{"text":"So I was very skeptical about eating sushi from a revolving conveyer belt. My little sister kept pushing me to stop being judgmental and try it. I am so glad I did. The price was super amazing, between $1-$3 a plate, which comes with 3-4 pieces of sushi per plate. The soda ($1.75), is in a plastic bottle so no unlimited refills however I have yet to need a refill while eating there. The majority of the seating is at the sushi bar. There are only a few tables there so it is hard to have a group conversation unless you are lucky enough to get a table. I have wanted different rolls than they offered and asked them to make them for me. They made them quickly and without hassle. The staff has always been very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"I've been twice and already wanting to go back.  Normally I get my sushi coma fill and I'm good for a few weeks; I kinda wanted to go back the next day.  I'm not huge on raw fish so I stick to the \"cooked\" rolls and they are always really good; First trip was $10 = 4 plates, iced tea, and tip.  Second trip ... no clue ... a friend paid but I would be willing to be it was closer to $15-$16 range.  Great for lunch with a crowd.  Accommodated 8 of us pretty easily.  If you go for lunch get there around 11:30.  Too early and not enough rolls are out.  The fun ones start coming out when more people show up.  But timing is everything - get there too late and you'll wait!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Been going to the location near Warner in Tempe, but am super glad they opened up a location near my work, and right near my grandparents. Great prices for decent sushi on the go!"}
{"text":"Fair pricing for fresh sushi rolls and sashimi on a revolving bar."}
{"text":"Decent nigiri, sashimi, rolls, and edamame."}
{"text":"Love this place! The shaggy dog and the haru poppers are my favorite!! Always friendly wait staff!"}
{"text":"VERY BAD SERVICE + BELOW AVERAGE SUSHI = 2 STARS.  The 2 stars is because the quality of food is below average and not that great. The Salmon looks like its been on the plates forever and has a real slimy look. I've had way better sushi in some all you can eat places!! Basically the only good thing is the gimmick with the conveyor belt. I would advise the reader to save his/her money for a better sushi place like Kabuki.  The next bad thing about this place is the atrocious service. They never bring you the drinks or seat you in a timely manner. God knows what the waitresses do over there...they run around as if its their first day at work and never get anything done like clear tables, get checks etc. I've been here a couple of times and I saw that the 2nd time, the patrons were not even waiting for the waitresses...they formed a line at the cashier like Denny's."}
{"text":"8:30 on a Friday night, no food in the house. Starving. Thanks for the tip yelpers! This place is awesome! The food is really good, the price is amazing and you're eating 30 seconds after you sit down.   The rolls are great and there's lots of variety. We topped off the night with mochi ice cream."}
{"text":"For starters, if you're going in expecting high-quality sushi, this probably isn't the place for you. Their fare is average AT BEST, but with that said, it's still pretty good and hardly puts a dent in your wallet. I can exit with a full stomach for generally around $12 (including tip).   The staff is very kind and friendly. With that said, they have some serious understaffing problems at times. There will be one poor girl in charge of taking care of 10+ people. It's not an ideal situation, but it's hardly the end of the world.  The conveyor belt is a cool aspect and makes it easy to come in, sit down, and start eating. For those seriously worried about the food quality, I've been there 30 + times and never experienced any issues whatsoever.  If you're craving sushi but don't want to spend an arm and a leg, I highly recommend this place. But temper your expectations a little..."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for everyone. My kids loved it and i loved all the options for them...California roll, edamame, miso soup, squid salad, pudding and the list goes on! Delicious sushi and the friendliest waitress. We will definitely be back.....TOMORROW."}
{"text":"Affordable. Friendly. Their haru poppers are AMAZING! If you don't see what you want you can ask and they'll make it for you. Great atmosphere. Lunch time and weekends are ridiculously busy so I'd recommend making a reservation!"}
{"text":"Sushi on conveyer belt, what can be better than That!!! I went to Phoenix to pick up my college freshmen so she took me there. The restaurant looked nice and clean.  Wait staffs are nice and respectful. I wish the sushi chefs were a bit more friendly but the moving sushi dished distracted me from feeling awkward.  Their pricing are very reasonable and lots of varieties.  I've read some positive reviews from other yelpers regarding dishes on the menu. I would love to try some of those next time I'm in town.  But the foods were good for the price we paid so I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was my worst restaurant experience to date. I didn't touch the food, because shortly after being seated the \"waitress\" snatched the wasabi, that was on the table, from my mother TWICE! Poor customer service means unhappy customers. We walked out very dissatisfied from the service of this low class server."}
{"text":"Decent for a quick, cheap sushi fix. Nuthin' fancy, but you can fill the belly with raw fish for under $20. They have the standard Japanese beer and sake available as well."}
{"text":"Quick bite for when youre fiending for sushi. The conveyor belts are a nice novelty for about 5 minutes. The atmosphere can be loud, brash and fun. I've been here a few times on different occasions and its always been between so-so and hella cheap fun. I guess thats the beauty of places like this. Walking that fine line of decent buffet sushi. Try the poppers!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. It could use some upgrading with decore but I thought the food was delicious.  Although some stuff looked not so fresh. Like it'd been sitting out for lomger than it should have. It was mine and my boyfriends first time trying sushi and it was definitely different with the conveyor belt, but I liked it a lot. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 start is for the freshness of the food, (wasn't the best) and because the place could use a makeover. Other than that, I loved it"}
{"text":"Revolving sushi. Great taste and amazing price. Best priced sushi in the valley. I didn't give it 5 stars because of the service. The place is always jam packed crowded, even at 3pm on a weekday. There are never enough servers, so it takes forever to get seated, and you usually have to hunt down a server to get your check. I work close by, and would go there 4x a week if they were more adequately staffed, but I just don't have the time to wait there."}
{"text":"Love this place, go almost every week! Great sushi especially for how cheap it is! If your looking for a good sushi place, this is it"}
{"text":"Great value and experience. We go about once a month, and it's always delicious. Sure you can get higher quality sushi if you pay more elsewhere, but you can't beat the variety and value and fun that you get at Teharu."}
{"text":"It pains me to give them such a mediocre score. The food is great. The sushi is fresh and has great flavor. The reason for the low marks is the service. They don't have a clue about running the front of the house. When I walk in there, I actually fell my stress level spike because the staff runs around scared like chickens with their heads cut off. They don't have servers, bussers, hostess, cashiers, everyone does everything and that is why the place is so chaotic. We ordered off the menu and the food simply never came. I didn't think it would since the waitress/busser/window washer/ gardener took my order and immediately went to buss a table and never visibly called my order to the kitchen. They were nice though when I told them it never came, they eventually they gave us a meal to go for free and discounted our bill. Nice people, good food, but the service is chaotic. This was not a one-off event either. I have been there about a dozen times and it is always the same poor service."}
{"text":"After eating at a conveyor belt sushi restaurant in Seattle several years ago, my husband and I were excited to see one in Scottsdale. Teharu Sushi did not disappoint.  The sushi was fresh and tasty. The prices are great!!  We went on the first Friday night they were open, so I'm very willing to forgive a few faux pas. The major issues were the lack of organization for arriving guests and the lack of engagement of the staff. Again, I get that they are just opening, so I'm sure they will settle into better customer service. The staff members were very nice even though it was obvious they were stressed.   Overall, good food, low prices and pleasant staff are enough to get 4 stars from me today."}
{"text":"Sushi is good.. Service is not good at all. We waited forever for our order and it never came. Waitress never came over, we had to keep calling her over."}
{"text":"This place was fire! I've always wanted to go to a conveyor belt sushi joint and I've never been near one until today! Man, it was one heck of an experience! I would give you a list of everything I tried but that would be nearly impossible since I tried nearly 10 different rolls. I had lunch with three of my band mates and we ate till we were stuffed and if you believe this it was less than $13 a piece, tip included! If we were from here we would be here everyday! Come check this place out, I promise you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Three years later and I'm still in love. Is it the best sushi?  No. But for the price, flippin' awesome.   I can eat me some salmon nigiri, and at this place, it's completely acceptable quality with an unbeatable price.  We typically call for takeout, like, 2 times per week. If this place ever closes, I don't know what I'd do."}
{"text":"I love love LOVE this place! The sushi is fresh, delicious, and even though they are crowded most of the time they work fast at getting you in. Don't expect this to be the best sushi out there, but being a big time sushi eater I'm very satisfied with it and it's a perfect place for me to go to because I get sushi several times a week. I can be full here for $12 instead of paying $40 elsewhere! Can't wait to go back again soon. So yum and the service there is great too!"}
{"text":"Back when I discovered Teharu in 2008 (didn't discover Yelp until 2009), it was still this secret little gem that I slowly introduced to all my friends and family (wait, could this all be my fault?!) But now, it seems during any meal time, there's quite a long wait, and not enough staff. And when you do finally get a seat, the selection on the belt is pretty limited since most of the popular stuff goes fast.  I was just recently here with some friends and we waited about 15 mins to seat us (3 people). I've been coming here intermittently (I no longer live in the US) but the last few times I've gone, it's just been disappointing. Normally, the staff is forgetful, slow and useless, but at least the last time I went the staff was fairly competent. But we ended up having to order some rolls and the most basic of our order (a crunch roll.. c'mon, a california roll with tempura flakes) took the longest. So long that we asked 3 different servers, and it actually took about 30 minutes to come (when the chefs finally made a batch to put on the belts). But any time you order something expect it to take a while.  I hope that they improve the service here - I always loved Teharu, fairly decent sushi at really cheap prices. Not the best, but definitely the most fun. I want to keep loving Teharu... please improve!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place since it opened, and I always plan a lunch/dinner here with friends when I'm back in town. The novelty of this place is that you get your sushi for a revolving conveyer belt! And they've spaced is so that it goes throughout the restaurant. Good for allowing people seated at booths to also access the belt, bad for if you want a certain type of sushi and need to wait for it to roll all the way around again...  I will say upfront that the quality is not the best. And over the years, I think the rolls have gotten smaller... And sometimes you don't know how long those rolls have been sitting out on the conveyer belt, waiting for someone to take them. On the plus side, the popular rolls are replenished quite frequently so those are always freshly made. You can even order from the chefs if there's something you want that's not on the belt.   And the prices can't be beat! From $1 for the cheapest, and $2 for the most expensive, the sushi comes on plates of 2-4 rolls. This is probably the best bang for your buck if you want to try a variety of different rolls. I always end up getting full on less than $10, which is pretty cheap for sushi!"}
{"text":"My first revolving sushi bar ever! I had a blast! Everyone is extremely nice and I love the option of special ordering sushi if you don't see what you want on the conveyor belt! Great prices too!"}
{"text":"I always thought I didn't like sushi! I've had friends take me to pricey, fancy sushi places - I tried many things, including eel, but I just didn't like anything. Plus, there were many dishes of sauces that no one at the table was using, or could tell me how to use. WTF?      I really, really didn't want to go for sushi, but I *did* want to hang out with my friends. I figured I could grab a California roll or two, and grab a burger or something later if I wanted.      But I found stuff here that I liked! I mean, REALLY liked! There was a list of what's in each roll, but on this day there were a LOT of dishes that weren't on the list. Some of them my friends could tell me, some not. They also had fun stuff like \"Haru poppers\", which are chilies with stuff in them. Not sure what, but it was good! I also don't know what's in the \"Tiger Roll\", but I was adventurous & it looked good, and since it was on a $1.50 plate, I took a chance. Not only did I love it, but I could confirm for one of my friends that it was a non-spicy dish, lol.      None of us care for wasabi so those dishes went untouched ... most things like the Spicy Shrimp & Crab rolls didn't need anything added, but the Tiger Rolls benefited from a couple of drops of soy sauce. I didn't know what the usagi (or whatever) sauce was, but it tasted like a soy bases fish or eel sauce. I didn't care for it, but I like having choices.      And that's what's great about this place! You can look at the food, and think \"Hmmm, maybe not\". You can have green tea hot or iced, or you can have soda or beer or plum wine! It wasn't that busy so there were a lot of empty spots on the conveyor, and I never did get a Philadelphia rolls 'cause everyone else grabbed them, but I definitely had a good time with friends & filled up on food I loved for $10!     One of my favorite things is the weird random stuff. Sometimes you'll look at the conveyor and there will be a can of Vienna sausage, Spam, mixed fruit, or a cup of chocolate pudding. I'm wondering how many people get dragged to sushi against their will by friends - this way, you can say \"MAN, ok, we get it, you don't like sushi, here, have some Spam!\" I almost grabbed the pudding because FUNNY, but I'd already had the little ice cream puffs thingies (YUM), so I didn't. Maybe I'll have some Vienna sausage next time. Nah ... too many yummy dishes!"}
{"text":"You really can't beat this place for the price. At no more than $2 for a plate  and each plate having 2-6 pieces you can get a full meal in for cheap.  They have a few good rolls like the Haiwian roll and the salmon lover (I think that was the name). The seaweed salad isn't bad either. What is nice is that if something isn't coming by on the belt here you can always order it from your server, but they have a pretty good selection on the belt.  The fish quality isn't the highest here but it also isn't horrible or going to make you sick, just don't try to compare it to that of Roka Akor or Nobu. If you are having a sushi craving or just want a cheap sushi meal it will be satisfying.  I think the best part is that you can eat until you are full here and still get out for under $20. My only addition to that is that if you are really starving then some of the $20 all you can eat places around town may end up saving you a couple bucks. It can be fun to see how high you can get your pile of old dishes. The one knock on the different plates costing different amounts is some plates aren't 100% clear what color they are so you may under estimate a bit, but it's max a $1 difference per plate.  I have gone to the Teharu in Scottsdale and Tempe and my advice is to go at times that are a bit busier as they will have more selection on the belts and the odds it was freshly made is higher than at off peak times. That really goes for any conveyor style sushi place though.  Overall I like Teharu as a low cost sushi craving filler, it's not the pinacle of fine sushi experiences but it's a fun and tasty stop."}
{"text":"Seated right away at 6:30 on a Monday. Food was very fresh and good. The California crunch roll and inari is my favorite. Regular and strawberry Ramune sodas available on the sushi conveyor belt. Will definitely we back."}
{"text":"This is a fun place that you should take the kids.  It's not every day a kid gets to take his food off a conveyor belt.  It might be a even a nice place to take a date.  In the lulls of conversations, you can discuss about the next item on the conveyor belt.  When I saw their plates of sushi were $1, $1.5 and $2, color me doubtful.  But I'm pretty happy with the results.  They had a baked scallop roll and I was hooked. While on the belt, the sushi comes covered with a clear plastic lid.   Since the food passes by so many people, this is a nice touch!  A lot of the reviewers mentioned the great service.   They did nothing extraordinary one way or the other; they could have spent more time explaining how the system works.   But you can figure it out by reading the placards on the table and just observing others.   Not a place that can sit large groups well.  Four is the max unless you get really lucky and get tables next to each other across the conveyor belt.  Decor ... lighting makes it feel more like a fast food Chinese place (or just a corporate restaurant).   But I've never chosen to eat at a restaurant because they have a cool statue or fountain in front."}
{"text":"Damn internet cut me off so I just lost this whole review and can't be bothered to retype it at the moment.  Haru is really good value and worth the trip. More details later."}
{"text":"Always happy coming here and we do a few times a month lol it's a guilt free kinda lunch/dinner and so happy we now have one in mesa! :D"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Its good sushi and a great price. Every time we go its always fun and a great dining experience. It was our little Tempe secret for a while but now the word it out and this place ROCKS~!"}
{"text":"My new lunch spot for now! Great revolving concept! Love that you can order off the menu as well and they will make your roll right then and really quickly!  The Hawaiian roll is excellent and I love alllllllll the sashimi and nigir! They also offer more traditional desserts so I feel anyone's tastebuds could be pleased here!"}
{"text":"The short of it? Lackluster menu.  Warm sushi. Fruit flies flying around everywhere, one even came poring out of the soy sauce bottle. Poor service. We asked to speak to a manager and was told \"there is none...\"  Definitely won't be returning.  AZ seriously needs to take a page out of California's book and up their conveyor belt sushi game. It's a joke out here."}
{"text":"A co-worker recommended this place to me. What's great about it is that the sushi travels to tables on a conveyor belt and you can automatically choose what you want. The baked scallop roll is delicious. The staff is very nice and happy to help. One of the best sushi places I have been to. Each plate is ranges from $1-2 each. How can you beat that? Whenever I go....it is usually about $10 a person. They do have a menu you can order off of as well. I just wish they had more of a drink selection."}
{"text":"I have always dreamed of a sushi bar where the sushi rolls revolves around you, where you grab to your heart's content....I mean, I'm from San Diego and I have never been to...as my friends and I like to call it...Conveyor belt sushi!!!   As soon as we walked in we were so excited...we just started grabbing anything and everything we could...well except for the fruit and pudding cups, WEIRD! But once you got over that, the sushi was good, I was impressed that the Las Vegas roll was still warm...and the basic sushi was good!  BUT there were 2 things that I had never had before....and at first look one might skip over these dishes...but you want to try them!! The Squid Salad, so freakin good! So flavorful and yummy! And the Poppers, I can't remember the first part of the name...these are jalapeño poppers, sushi style. So good! MUST TRY!  After grabbing to our stomachs delight and piling the plates as high as they would go, we only spend $12 per person and we were stuffed...next time we should control ourselves better!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Teharu Sushi for quite some time and they are consistently decent (not great.)   Pros: - If you select food from the conveyor belt, you can eat somewhat quickly and inexpensively. - The quality of the sushi has been consistently decent (not great). - Handrolls and other sushi from the menu is much more fresh and much better than that from the conveyor belt.  Cons: - Most of the time they only have 3 or 4 tables open (mostly counter seating.) Not sure why this is the case since the entire restaurant is set up with access to the conveyor belts. - Quite often there is a wait (see \"Con\" line above = open more tables up) - Because of the previous \"Cons\" the servers are often running around and do service is often very poor. The last time I was there the server told me I couldn't have a table and had to sit at the counter even though tables were open. Also, the server gave me attitude each time I asked for something. A woman next to me even noticed the harsh treatment and gave me her fork for my daughter to use. Each time I asked for something (drink, napkin, ginger, more wasabi) she would rush past me and ignore me and then I'd have to ask her several more times. - Some of the sushi from the conveyor belt doesn't seem to be the freshest and often I wonder how many times it's been spinning around on the belt."}
{"text":"The one positive about this place is it is relatively cheap for sushi. But then again, you get what you pay for. None of the plates that I tried we're anything but average.  The service here was beyond terrible however. Sometimes people try to attribute that to persons not speaking English as their first language. As an immigrant myself I don't accept that as an excuse. Here they're just rude.  The cheap prices don't make up for the meh food as well as terrible service."}
{"text":"Quality, portioning, and sizes smaller and prices higher. Used to love this place. However no more. Time to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here for our first time and had an amazing experience. Super cheap and our servers were HILARIOUS. They had us laughing the whole time."}
{"text":"Never gonna eat here again. I've always found their food questionable, and tonight I learned I was right. I've been vomiting profusely for the past hours, and I haven't vomited or had food poisoning in about ten years. I heard this place already didn't pass inspection once, and it seems they don't care about their customer's health. Please beware, and don't risk it. It's not worthy it for low quality sushi."}
{"text":"Well, was again disappointed with the wait and decided to leave to the perfect pair next door and was seated quick. So, this place is larger than they make it.. a typical busy night youd think theyd open up the other half of their restaurant instead of letting 20 people sit and wait 30 min plus.. in addition.. NOT CLEAN! Have you ever looked at your chairs or floor?? The black sludge from constant mopping with nasty water it has collected on the cracks and chairs.. i will still eat here yet i hope this place starts to clean up their act.."}
{"text":"The novelty and convenience of a sushi belt comes at a price. The temperature of the fish and sushi pieces were too warm, leaving an unpleasant mouth feel and much to be desired, taste wise. One of the two times I ate there, the waitress was negligent of our table -- we had to ask for water 20 minutes after seating and already into our meal. Overall: Limited selection of sushi, inexpensive, fast (can get in and out for lunch in as quick as 40 minutes), and friendly but not always attentive servers."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and tastes great for a fast food sushi place, however the service is HORRIBLE.   The last 5 visits here the wait always 20-30 minutes waiting on an empty table when half the restaurant remains closed.  Then other visits the wait is 20-30 minutes while I sit here and look at 4 empty tables that only need to be cleaned.    In the event that you actually wait for all that then get seated be sure you order any drinks or ask for extras while your waiter is standing there as typically she won't be back.  Getting your receipt, well you will defiantly need to ask for it then about 15 minutes later it will arrive.     Long stor0y short, great food and decent place if you can be  Patient enough and have enough time to sit and wait for the shenanigans."}
{"text":"Mediocre sushi but cool experience. Come during a busy time so you know they are replenishing the sushi quickly. No one wants warm fish. Yuck!"}
{"text":"This place is a great solution when you need a sushi fix.  While the sushi is not up to the standards of other places in town sofar as size and taste, it's still passable food, especially if you look for the fresher looking sushi or order stuff.   Conveyer style is very fun and adds to the ambiance.  The staff is alright, and the place can vary from quiet to packed depending on time and day.  3 stars for sure, and it'd get 3.5 if yelp offered 1/2s."}
{"text":"Want a cheap, fun & fast sushi experience? This is it!! If you're a sushi snob, this place may not impress you since the sushi is somewhat mediocre (you get what you pay for!) although it's definitely worth checking out.   The sushi comes on plates (ranging from $1 to $2.50) and travels on a conveyor belt around the sushi chefs - definitely a fun experience! There's a variety of rolls and salads to choose from, as well as random things like Asian soda, juice, pudding, cheesecake and cream puffs.  It's can be a hit & miss depending on the time of day and how busy it is. Lunch & dinner time may have you waiting a while. Be sure to get your name down immediately on the notepad by the door and write how many people are in your party. The staff are friendly and attentive. Once seated, how much time and money you want to spend is entirely up to you! It's definitely a great place for a quick lunch! I go there at least once a week for my sushi fix!  Although what's offered is on the belt, you can make requests for items you don't see. Overall, I'd say this place is enjoyable. The atmosphere is relaxed, casual and clean. Definitely a must-try! Bring your friends and family! At the end, stack up your empty plates! You'd be surprised how many you end up with when you're not paying attention! ;) Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and love the delivery service.  Great to take friends who haven't experienced this before.  Keeps the conversation going as the food travels around the restaurant.  I ate until I couldn't eat no more and it was $12. Pretty frickin sweet."}
{"text":"OK. This place is not good for groups. I repeat, not ideal for groups.  I called this place for several days to make a reservation for my curious diners of 10 and not once was that phone picked up on the other end.  Maybe the ringer was on silent! Well, we showed up, signed in and waited in line. I was nervous because I wanted all of us to sit together.   I got the attention of a waitress to tell her about our dilemma and she said, \"Yeah, we take large groups but you have to make a reservation.\" Really? What a novel idea. Imagine my frustration. I told her to make it work.  Surprisingly, our wait was less than half hour.   So, you could say we all sat together if only the conveyor belt was not running between our two tables.  I guess it was the best they could do \"last minute.\" Nonetheless, we made the most of it.    I was apprehensive about the service from all the reviews I've read, but I must say the waitstaff was on their best behavior.  I thought they were friendly.  I find that it's quite true about where you sit because most of the sushi we grabbed were cold. We were closer to the end of the belt! But we love the saki. We even did some bomb sakis for fun.  Overall, it was a cool spot and a nice experience!"}
{"text":"Food always taste great but sometimes they lack on the selection and take awhile to update the popular dishes. Service is horrible but the only thing you really need the servers for is to get a refill, if your drinking water just ask for a pitcher. Price is great also! Two pieces of Nigiri for $1 and half rolls for $1.50 or $2 depending on the roll."}
{"text":"Great sushi with a lot of choices. Conveyer belt is cool because you can see and try things you might otherwise pass up on the menu if you are not familiar with them. Highly recommend the eel rolls! Seaweed salad is spectacular. A lot of food for a lot less than high end sushi restaurants. They serve sake and such as well. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I luh dis place. I came here for the first time over Thanksgiving Break and it is probably my new go to sushi place when I'm visiting the Chandler/Gilbert area. Pricing? Great! Sushi? Great! The uniqueness of the belt sets it apart from other Sushi restaurants as well and I honestly feel like it is faster than ordering off a card. All in all I am extremely excited to visit again."}
{"text":"the sushi is a good deal & tastes good. decent selection. the service however had us pretty mad by the rime we got out of there. Horrible! our waitress dropped off our drinks & that was it. i had to flag down a chef for more chopsticks, another waiter for a refill, which her slammed down at the end of our table where i couldnt even reach it. we had to stand up & wave to get our check. the staff showed no interest in helping anyone & hung around the cash register most of the time. we wont be going back"}
{"text":"not fine dinning but great for the price. the sushi, selection & service was great. i spent $9.50 w/tip"}
{"text":"Sooo, disappointed.  It's whitey sushi - that is sushi that whitey likes.  All the bizzarre rolls that have never seen the shores of Japan (i.e. Las Vegas rolls, Hawaii rolls, etc.)  Had I realized it, I wouldn't have gone.  But for the price it's OK."}
{"text":"I freaking love this place. My boyfriend brought me here for the first time because I was far too curious about the whole conveyor belt concept. It's definitely not fancy nor \"fine\" but what do you really expect when you're paying one dollar for a plate? Quality comes with a high price. The prices of the plates is what makes it fun because you can try something new without being afraid of ordering an entire roll of something you can't stomach and paying a bundle for it. Have I mentioned sake bombers are 5 dollars and a regular large Sapporo is 3.50? Not bad for going out.  All the waitresses have been fine. Some more English-friendly than others but always very attentive. 10 seconds after I grabbed some mandarin oranges off the belt our server was behind us with a spoon, ha.  I also like the fact that you can eat at your own pace and there's no pressure to order or finish in a typical time frame. The veggie tempura was pretty good and the miso soup was yummy too.  Overall, it's a lot of fun to eat here. It's nice-When you leave, the sushi chefs and servers all say good bye."}
{"text":"I've since been back and they've done some hiring/training. It's much better service now."}
{"text":"I have always had a good experience here. I probably come once a week. I sit at the bar eat and read my book. The wait staff has always been nice and friendly to me. Sushi is great and very reasonably priced. Sometimes they are very busy and u may have to wait a little bit for a refill but that's not common. Overall I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It may not be the \"best\" sushi in town, but it's so much fun. Potato Mountain Rules! Great value."}
{"text":"Decent prices and decent sushi  Cool idea where you just grab plates as they rotate around in a conveyor. Prices by the plate based on color of each plate.   Not the freshest or best but not bad either..."}
{"text":"Love this place. Inexpensive and still pretty good selection off the conveyor. They also have a full menu to choose from."}
{"text":"Cheap Sushi= good, Cheap Sushi REVOLVING around you at all times = GREAT SUSHI! I loved this place the most expensive plate is $2.50. They had super yummy rolls and mochi! I plan to go back!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place , everything is always fresh. Very affordable, I had a bill for 4 people only $35, which not bad for a sushi restaurant. I'll definitely recommend to everyone"}
{"text":"Quality of the food along with incredibly reasonable prices give this place the four stars. The server was rude or it would have been a full 5 stars...  Came in here a few nights ago. Although I don't eat fish but the asparagus roll was amazing and I highly recommend the seaweed salad. My son had the crunch roll and a stuffed jalapeño roll. He said it was really good.   I wish the server had been even remotely friendly I would given them a higher rating...but I still recommend..."}
{"text":"We usually eat at the Scottsdale location, but were in the Tempe area so we decided to have lunch here. As soon as we walked in, employees just standing by glanced at us and started walking away, and one just pulled out two chairs without a simple 'hello' or smile. The sushi was affordable as we expected, but the whole restaurant was warm inside. The fish was room temperature. We couldn't even finish some plates because they were so warm. Hopefully we don't get sick tonight. And the servers never spoke to us except to refill my cup just once. No one seemed happy to be there. We'll stick to our scottsdale location from now on."}
{"text":"Sushi is okay, but my daughter loves the novelty of it!  Probably a good place to try a lot of different options, but not the best quality by any stretch.  Still, fun novelty restaurant."}
{"text":"Wasn't the biggest fan! We were unsure of the pricing and when we asked the girl she responded with \"I don't really know\" sushi was okay just lots of shrimp and crab options..."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Very affordable for a sushi conveyor restaurant. Tons of options and everything I tried was delicious. Just visiting in town for a business trip but would definitely go back. Sushi and appetizers were very good."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for the first time today after a few recommendations from some friends. I wasn't impressed with the food. It was fresh but wasn't as flavorful as the sushi I'm used to eating. It's a good place to grab some cheap sushi to satisfy your sushi craving but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Love! A revolving sushi bar! It's a nice change to be able to select small amounts of different sushi. Prices are great; they charge you by the color of the plate your sushi comes on. We ate a moderate amount with 2 bottles of diet coke and tip for about $25. We could have ate more, but we were full!   The bathrooms were a mess! That is why they only get 4 stars from me. Toilet paper was not mounted (just sitting on counter). I actually felt dirtier coming out! Anyways, fantastic food! Go!"}
{"text":"Love the revolving sushi concept & this is one of favorites. Always a good selection & they will make to order any pieces you want not on the belt. Japanese soda, cheesecake & jello pudding also make an appearance on the sushi belt.  Be prepared for a wait at peak lunch & dinner times as this place is popping."}
{"text":"Very good quality food, the service peoples that sit you down are really lame. Very impatient and super lame! They really show you how lame they are. It's been awhile since I've been there, but hopefully the owner replaced them.  You can't hate on their food!"}
{"text":"This place is far from where I live, but so worth the trip! Had some wonderful friends take me here. I love conveyor belt sushi, and I've missed it - prepare yourself because I am about to brag - ever since I last went to Japan. The sushi quality and variety wasn't bad either...although, I was a little sad that more of the different rolls started coming out about 40 minutes after we were there and I had already stuffed my face to the point where I couldn't eat anymore. I was surprised to see they had gyoza and even cheesecake! Both were good, btw.   NOW - my only complaint about this place was the two waitresses we had that day.  We strolled in just after 1pm and immediately upon entering were abruptly told to sit down at the waiting bench. Okay. The first waitress comes back and tells us that our table is ready. After surveying the sushi bar, we politely asked if we could wait for seats at the bar. Her response was a heavy sigh as if we asked to be seated on the actual conveyor belt, then she walked away.  Sooooooo...does that mean we can or can't? I didn't know, as she walked away from us without an actual answer besides her obvious body language. Come on...I could understand if it was really busy and there were people behind us - but there was neither. So after waitress number one doesn't come back, waitress number two tries to seat us at that same table and we politely asked her the same question - \"May we be seated at the bar please? We're fine with waiting.\" Guess what?!?! SAME REACTION! Walked away and everything... Again, soooooooo does that mean we can or can't?  After a few minutes of waiting I finally got my answer (not verbally), but we were seated at the bar. The food made up for the blatant rudeness, but it is the customer service that is the reason I'm taking a star off. My friends go here fairly regularly and assured us the service was never like that before... I'm taking their word for it and will definitely update my review after my next visit to Teharu Sushi.  Oh...and after all my ranting, let me not forget to mention something positive - the bill was cheap!!! I seriously thought I ate about $30 worth (I SO was not counting), but it only came out to half that :D"}
{"text":"Omgggggggg this place is amazing me and my wife comes here way to much I should have been written a review. There always so busy each and everytime I come here all the sushi rolls are amazing you have to try this place at least once there prices are amazing and so are the ppl that work here. Sushi rolls running across the moving belt you can always come across something new. Def a reg customer and my family came for the 1st time and they enjoyed it as well."}
{"text":"Food was good,  no raw exotic seafood but good.  Interesting the revolving counter where you pick the plate. You pay by the plate. Fun."}
{"text":"Yes, this has dropped to a single star for me after our last experience. We went in for a weekday lunch, so it wasn't super busy. I'd say the quality of the food is the same. What caused the change? The German cockroach climbing the wall behind us. This wasn't a sewer roach. When your house becomes infested with roaches, these are the roaches you find. There is never just one, and the fact that it was in the dining area has it a little too close to the food prep area (which is smack in the middle of the dining room). I'm not generally one to generally worry about a bug or two. Flies come in through the door, etc. Roaches are a different matter entirely. Our last visit was just that... our last visit."}
{"text":"I had never tried sushi before a friend brought me here, but this place has turned me into a sushi addict. Everything is fresh, and you can't beat the prices; if you skip the soft drinks and dessert, it's easy to stuff yourself for less than $10. If the thought of raw fish grosses you out, the menu clearly labels which pieces contain it. Especially recommended is the Tiger Roll, although the Rainbow Roll is excellent as well. I'm learning how to use chopsticks at the tender age of 43, but never fear: forks are available for the asking. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Awesome place!!! I use to go here  since it was a little less popular back in 2010 then people start to notice this place and got crowded. ( long long wait) Now , they're waiting time is less than 15 mins."}
{"text":"Oh yeah. If u like sushi then you have to try Teharu Sushi. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Let's talk about sushi. Better yet, revolving sushi. Great for a bunch of friends or just a cute little date night right before the movies. Super inexpensive and you can leave that place with a belly full of yummy sushi for just under $10.00 bucks. I mean A LOT of sushi for $10.00. Go try it, they are great and friendly."}
{"text":"Definitely a good way to get a quick sushi fix.  The sushi here is INCREDIBLY cheap compared to other restaurants with plates of 2-4 pieces for $1-$2.  However, it might be better to consider the sushi here \"fast food sushi.\"  The rolls are small and pretty basic overall, many are variants of the california roll with different items on top.  i.e. california roll + chruncy topping = crunch roll + salmon = salmon roll + potato = mountain potato  and so forth.  The deep fried rolls are good if you can get them fresh, but by the time they come around the conveyor belt, that is often not the case.  While I love the atmosphere and the simplicity of the dining experience, this is not the place to get real, authentic sushi.  Also, this restaurant is always packed.  There was a waiting list to sit at 3 in the afternoon.  As such, it can be difficult to get the waiter's attention when you need a refill of water or the bill.    All in all, a good restaurant at a good location."}
{"text":"So I'm pretty late on this review! The waiter tony is amazing! I've been here many times before but never had the opportunity to have him serve us. Not saying service is bad he just made it that much better! Treated us as guest and not as customers, yes there is a huge difference! He should be a manger or a trainer if not yet already. Keep up the great work tony!"}
{"text":"My first Revolving Sushi experience ... EVER!  I was more excited driving their I guess my expectations were way High It was decent, My favorite roll their was Baked Scallop Roll, Loved their Baked Mussels. Ps Miso Soup is on menu Must order separate. Will try again soon want to try their  Spicy Korean Ramen on their menu."}
{"text":"Go for the novelty.  (For instance there will be random items like Japanese soda, fruit cups and pudding cups on the conveyor belt).  This place gets busy so call ahead if you are going to be hungry.  I like to stick with the simple sushi, (if you get full I'm not ashamed to admit I eat around the rice).  The rolls tend to get really repeatative, i.e. they all have crab mix, mayo and cream cheese.  If you can get a table near the kitchen you'll have a bird's eye view of the hot items and you can grab them while they're fresh.  Sake bombs are $5.00 which is a steal.  You'll eat and eat and eat and be surprised at how reasonable the price is."}
{"text":"I was skeptical coming here, but I actually liked this place. Yes customer service was not best, but I was acknowledged and everything I asked for I got. A smile or simple hello would help them out a bit.   Anyhow yes the food is on a moving circle thing and you pick what you're craving it's super simple. Honestly I liked almost all my rolls except the shrimp tempura it had no avocado, but that's an easy fix. I really liked that they had all the rolls and salads labeled right before them so we did not have to be asking what something was. My favorite roll was the rainbow roll and the seaweed salad was really good. My friend had baked mussels and he said they were super delicious in case anyone likes those. They also had a cheesecake that was so good that we had 2 lol  I would come back the prices are really really cheap and it takes the craving out of sushi without  having to spend an arm and a leg. My bill was $13 and had a ton of food and that includes my sake bomber."}
{"text":"Dear Revolving Sushi inventor, I fell in love with you today, thank you for your contribution to our society.    When my coworker invited me to check out this place with her I jumped at the chance.  Although I was a little nervous that it was so cheap, I was determined to replace my qualms with a sense of adventure. Luckily, we arrived for lunch at 11:00, I know it's early but by 11:30 eager sushi eaters started coming out of the woodwork and had to wait for a seat.  As we sat down the server took our drink orders and gave us our drinks rather quickly.  That was the last time we saw her until the check came.  I can't say enough good things about what it's like to sit down at your table and already have the food in front of you.  The first thing I tried was the salmon sashimi it was honestly one of the best pieces of salmon I've ever had.  Next I tried the tuna sashimi, meh, not so much.  Everything after that was delicious.  My coworker and I just kept grabbing and grabbing.  The plates ranged from $1.00 - $2.00.  When our bill came it was $26, for both of us!  Stop what you're doing and go eat there, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  One of the best conveyor-belt sushi places in phx!  I've been here many times and the sushi is always fresh (even when there are not many customers)."}
{"text":"A great place to grab a quick, affordable meal. The sushi quality seems good for the price and the service is generally fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Yelp helped me find this place and I'm so happy because I never thought that I would see this type of restaurant in America and I love going here, especially when I'm missing living in Japan. The only thing that would make it even better is the automated system to order from but that's asking too much, haha."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the shaggy dog sushi and the pot stickers! It's fun to just pick up what you see and it's quite affordable. Make sure to keep a good eye out for the fresher plates. Also the cheesecake is awesome! I love this place. It's a good place to go with some friends and just have a big ol sushi fest!"}
{"text":"A last minute decision to come to Teharu Sushi turned out to be an awful one. It being a Sunday evening with a majority of restaurants closing early, we didn't have too many options so we came here.  We arrived two hours before closing and the restaurant was empty with the exception of the very few tables occupied. There were 4 sushi chefs working behind the conveyor belt yet none of them welcomed any of us upon walking in.  Having been to other rotating sushi locations in So Cal, Teharu sushi has limited options available and their kitchen items menu is pretty non existent. The plates cost between $1-$2. Everything on the belt was basic; California, spicy tuna, tempura shrimp, rainbow and spicy crab. In regards to the taste, the quality was poor as the seafood did not look fresh. Even the rice fell apart upon taking a bite.  Service was extremely poor. The server kept forgetting our orders, accidentally dropped our order on the floor and at times had to be approach to ask for items such as more napkins and drink refills. With the manager sitting directly across from our table, she decided to ignore our party while she continued to dine on her meal though it was obvious we were frustrated with the lack of service and disappointment in food.   Never would I return to such a place that could careless about the food they serve or paying customers."}
{"text":"I've never been to a sushi restaurant where the food comes to you on a conveyor belt. That being said I was reluctant to try anything that I felt would be scary if it sat too long. But then I learned that you can order sushi directly from the sushi chef and that way you don't have to worry about it being fresh. So now I can give this restaurant a thumbs up...pretty good. And, I'll say this, it's inexpensive."}
{"text":"My wife and I really dig this place. We have frequented the Chandler location and were very happy to see one in our area sprout up. We have never had a bad experience. The meal price is very reasonable for a sushi place. Here is the secret trick, don't wait for the conveyor belt to come around. If you want something ask for it, if its on the belt they will grab it. If not, they will make anything on the menu and bring it right to you. The scallops and hard poppers are awesome!"}
{"text":"This resturant is great. The sushi good and the prices are cheap. I'll leave here completely stuffed and the bill will be like $20 for two people without drinks, with drinks its about $30 - $40 depending on how many saki bombers you have again thats for two people. the plates range from $1 to $3. If its close to closing you have to order your sushi but it is still the same price as if it was on the conveyor belt."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It's a conveyer belt sushi place. You have your typical sushi rolls and then their specialty rolls which are usually the $2 which is the most expensive plate. My favorite roll they have is the shaggy dog roll! If you're looking for good sushi and be in and out under 30 min, I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I cannot get over how cheap this place is. I love going there for lunch. The food is great, the selection is great, obviously with the conveyor belt, there is no waiting."}
{"text":"Teharu Sushi just opened today perhaps they have yet a few kinks to iron out.    1.  The miso soup was not warm at all. 2.  Sushi on the conveyer were lukewarm at best (what's supposed to be hot was not hot, and what is to be cold was not cold). 3.  Service provided by the waiter was good, no complaints there.  I'll give this place some time to mature and will update with another review later in the year."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! The service is prompt, food is great, $$ is affordable. I only gave 4 stars because I hope they come up with a little more choices in sushi :) other than that, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Sushi is just okay, nothing special. It's somewhere you go if you want sushi for cheap lol. It's affordable and pretty good.  The service here is very very very slow. They do not check on you until way late. They aren't as organized as the location on priest. The servers here do not get you your drinks or anything else in a timely manner. If they can brush up on the service, they have potential.   Oh yeah, and one of the waitress there... Lol.. We told her that the iced green tea tastes like pure water that's a light green color... And her response is, oh well I'm too busy to make another batch.. Are you for real lmao..."}
{"text":"It was good and fast. Not that pricy ., We liked that we could see the sushi before getting it and our daughter liked the revolving sushi idea"}
{"text":"Not a bad option for a quick sushi on budget.  Where else can you just start eating as soon as you are seated? Pick only what you want from conveyor belt and pay based on # of plates you eat. You could eat 3 plates or 20 plates depending on your appetite.  Unlike another teharu location, this particular location puts more nigiri. They have rolls too but I am here for nigiri. On this particular time I came, their white tuna and salmon were good quality, I kept eating mostly white tuna.  Service here is always good.   Good place to come for inexpensive and fast sushi"}
{"text":"Had lunch here shortly after arriving to Tempe. My co-worker asked me, \"are you okay with sushi for lunch?\" Buddy, you have know idea how okay I am with sushi. I've been craving sushi the past couple of weeks!  So on our way to the restaurant when someone says, \"is this the place where the sushi is on a conveyor belt?\" In my head, I was like, \"Yay! revolving sushi!\" I haven't had revolving sushi since last year while in HI. Interestingly enough, one of my co-workers commented on how he's never been or even heard of revolving sushi before. I shared with the guys that it really isn't anything new. It was a huge trend in the late 90s and  then it faded out only for it to be the in thing couple of years ago.  I even told the guys, for us residing in Vegas and Vegas being such a foodie destination, I'm surprised there aren't any in Vegas.  So I'm excited because I'm so looking forward to get a crunch roll!   We get to the restaurant at about 11:15 am and the restaurant is already packed. For some reason, they only opened up half of the restaurant so we had to split up for lunch, 4 on a table way in the back and two that just opened up at the counter. Of course, I want to be at the counter!  So I get my usual seaweed salad and gyoza and two other sushi dishes as I patiently waited for the shrimp crunch roll which disappointingly never came :(  I guess I'm spoiled and asking for too much?  Good customer service, okay sushi, disappointed there was no shrimp tempura options."}
{"text":"Great sushi, great sashimi, great rolls, great food all around.  They do have other options than what is on the conveyor belt, but why wouldn't you want to grab the fresh food that's stolling by as you sit peacefully.    We go at least once a month.  Dinner during the week is a lot easier than anytime on the weekends or Fridays.    Hooray for delicious food on the move! If you're not hungry, don't pull more food off the belt. Only take what you want--perfect for sharing."}
{"text":"Sushi goes on conveyor belt, rolls them in front you, and you take the ones you like. It's that simple. They count up your plates at the end and charge you. You can come here and eat all the $1 sushi you want!  Sushi is cheap. If you get $1 plates, you can spend $7 for 14 pieces of sushi. if you get the rolls, it will be more expensive. Please do not get the can of fruit or cheesecake. Those are designed for suckers.  The sushi is not premium sushi or prepared with the best technique.   But for a fun atmosphere, cheap food and this gimmick with the conveyor belt, this place hits the spot. Just don't come during dinner and you could be waiting 30 minutes to get seated. I come here because all of my friends love this place. And what's eating sushi without good friends, right? :)"}
{"text":"Teharu's concept of the conveyor belt for sushi distribution is novel and fun at first, but then you start to realize that the ones that keep coming around have been sitting there for a while. The options also were not very appealing to me. You can order and have items freshly prepared too, but I feel like that defeats the purpose. Even though the prices are low, I still don't think it's worth it for the quality and amount of the food you are getting, since each plate is often just half of a roll or a really small roll. I would normally pay $24 for two full and hefty rolls at other restaurants, and this always is enough for me. At Teharu, I could easily order eight plates of $3 rolls, but the quality and freshness of the sushi would not be as good. The atmosphere also isn't the best. The seats and tables look and feel really worn, and the seating arrangement for the conveyor belt makes it inconvenient for larger groups."}
{"text":"Good sushi and fresh off the belt.  At least at dinner time.  Don't count on service though and certainly not in the Japanese gracious fashion.  If you want cheap and self service great if you're looking for service go to the location in North Scottsdale.  They know service."}
{"text":"Nothing short of awful. I was so surprised to see so many people here. I asked one man with his family if he had been here before and how the food was on the way inside. His reply was something along the lines of he didn't like sushi but this place was pretty good. Hmm... Perhaps something to consider next time. It's got a belt style sushi server with a list of what everything is and how much it is. The wasabi was whipped. Yes, I did say whipped! The fish on the sushi rolls was microscopic, and everything I tried, I hoped would taste better than the last, sadly did not. The wait staff is essentially non existent, and I was charged too much in the end, which I didn't care, because at that point I wasn't sure where, when, or how I was going to get sick."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My boyfriend & I had never been to a conveyer belt sushi place so we asked how it works (ordering, cost, etc.) and they were more than helpful! The sushi was great, too. Small portions but we were full with 7 or 8 plates and it only cost $15. It was amazing.  Only complaint I have is that they are highly understaffed. We didn't get a refill on drinks because the poor waitress was running around doing everything by herself; hostess, waitress, busser, cashier. But other than that it was great!"}
{"text":"Definitely not the best sushi but you gotta love the prices!"}
{"text":"Affordable, good sushi - check!  Conveyor style with lots of selections - check!  Clean, friendly ambiance - check!  Interesting, fun sushi rolls - check!  Unique appetizers, salads and desserts on conveyor - check!  Full tummies for only $10-$15/person - check!    moral of the story... check it out!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Every plate is under $3 which is great on my wallet. The dumplings are amazing and I love the crab roll. I'm not a fan of how they do their seating though. They have another side with chairs which I almost never see utilized. Instead they they use one half of the restaurant to seat people. When you get there you almost always have to sign a list with your name and party size. Then wait on the side like the kid last picked at recess watching all the other people eat. Meanwhile they have plenty of room on the other side to sit...but it's never open. You can't even sit down at a table and be offered a water you just sit and wait until other people have had their fill. Luckily I've never gone with more than one other person. I bet it's awful if you had a large party you would likely have to wait 20min or more.  When it can easily be avoided all together by opening up more seating. Despite other reviews I've seen I wouldn't recommend going at busy hours if you're really hungry and with a large group."}
{"text":"I am bummed that I did not know about this place until last week. Sushi on a conveyor belt on plates for $2 or $3 per plate? YES PLEASE! That way I can be greedy but on a budget. The place was packed at 11:30am ( it opens at 11am) so that was great sign. We had a GREAT table right next to where the sushi was literally being made and coming out. So needless to say we got the freshest plates first ( not that all of it wasn't fresh as it was) From the unagi to the las vegas roll, to the crunch roll, to the edamame, I mean I could go on and on and on.  So if it was so great, why only 4 stars? Getting your cup of water refilled along with trying to pay for your meal was a little hard. It was like they didn't want me to wash down my sushi or pay for it lol. All in all I will definitely be back to visit again real soon."}
{"text":"Teharu is supremely average. The clientele left something to be desired (I guess that's not their fault though), as when I visited it was full of ASU students. The music was some terrible Billboard 100 mix. I don't know, when I eat sushi I don't really want to listen to what's on 97.5, I guess.   Anyway, the food was pretty terrible. I do like the conveyor belt style, since it's a cool part of eating sushi in Japan, but I feel like they didn't really pull it off. Instead of a small amount of fresh sushi going around, it was packed full of rolls that could've been there for hours, getting warm (I didn't notice any quality control). We visited a while ago so I can't remember what exactly I tried, but it was forgettable. Tasted like grocery store sushi; very fishy and didn't have a really fresh flavor at all. Even for the price (dirt cheap), it really wasn't worth it for SUCH a sub-par meal. The cream puffs were pretty good though, and I was really amused at the snack-paks and apple juice cartons going around too.   I've seen some reviews complaining about the service, but I thought the service was actually pretty good. Just had to signal someone to come over for the check and they were very attentive and nice, quick about getting it to us and giving my card back.  In summary, the next day there were stomachaches had by everyone we'd gone there with, so I will not be back; 2 stars for the cream puffs and the staff."}
{"text":"Walked in and walked out at 9:15. There were a bunch of people just standing around, presumably waiting for a spot at the rotating bar, because there were plenty of empty dining tables.  I did not like:   Not being greeted for over 5 minutes while I was there - it appears that is the way they operate there by choice, if it just seemed like poor customer service the rating would have been one-star  Personally handwriting my name on the waiting list, I noticed that on the whole list I would have been the only party of one out of like 20 names.... I honestly didn't feel comfortable with that!  No bar to sit at, just a rotating sushi bar"}
{"text":"Okay, the only reasons this place gets 3 stars are the facts that the rolls are pretty good, pretty cheap, and with lots of variety. The service here is AWFUL. As in, don't expect a refill on your drink, don't expect anyone to ask how you're doing, don't expect to get food ordered off the menu any time soon (and sometimes at all), and don't expect them to suddenly pick up the speed when it's time to pay. And, when you say something about it, the response is quite literally, \"Meh.\" If you're willing to pay a bit more, there's another sushi place (Osaka) in the same freaking complex and their food is FANTASTIC with top-notch service. You'd think the management would care that their service is so terrible that people regularly complain about it online, especially with a better option right there."}
{"text":"After trying this place out recently, I have to agree with many of the reviews on the fact the price is right but not great quality sushi. I did like the concept of sitting down and immediately start eating. The variety was nice but the food itself was luke warm at best (I like my vegas roll and dumplings warm). The best thing I ate was the \"I love salmon\" roll. Service was OK, our drinks took a while to get to the table and staff was a little too casual for my liking. Our waiter pretty much insinuated I should be able to handle drinking a large beer because thats all they serve in the beer I wanted. When my friend asked for ginger ale, the waiter laughed and said \"we dont have that\". When she ordered lemonade, he brought back an arnold palmer. I get they were busy but a little attention would have been nice. Overall, I would probably come back for a quick and cheap meal but I can't say I will be running back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Fair price, the service could be better. Lack of selection but everything seemed fresh.   J out."}
{"text":"FYI I will delete this review but the owners should know. After my friend and I finished our meal a cockroach began walking across the conveyor belt and up the side of the fresh fish case. And your men's bathroom is filthy. Take some pride in your business and clean things up."}
{"text":"First time here.. the concept is cool. pulling your food off the conveyor makes it easy to pick items that you might not order otherwise. The price and portions was great. The only reason they do not get 5 star is that we had a large group (with a reservation) and they did not open the other half of the restaurant to make it easy for everyone to see the food. so now with 15 people stick out from the conveyor the first to sit down had to grab and pass down orders for everyone else. makes enjoying your food really hard."}
{"text":"This place is either extremely busy with a long wait or slow & u get to sit down right away! I just get super annoyed when they are extremely busy with a long wait and don't open up the other side!! Now onto the sushi... It's cheap! Usually $2-3 per plate.... Not the most amazing tasting sushi... But good enough....hits the spot when I want something small and fast! If you do not like rolls this is NOT the place for you, as 99% of the sushi is rolls! Still always good for a quick sushi bite!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times. I love the sushi, but it's hit or miss as to what's available. Service is the same. Some of the girls really hustle and buss the tables, others, not so much. We walked in at 8pm, they close at 9pm. The waitress told us the kitchen was closed and whatever is on the conveyer belt is all that's available. Needless to say, us and a couple of other tables were grabbing up what we could, which wasn't much. In my opinion, if you close at 9pm, then all food should be available til 9pm."}
{"text":"I love sushi but HATE the wait. For me waiting for sushi is worse than a religious zealot trying to force feed dogma down my throat. *Cough*  Where can I eat sushi without ensuing this torture?! Look no more people of Yelp land; Teharu is sushi on demand!  A large conveyer belt snakes its way through the restaurant, encompassed by bright yellow walls that look like Pikachu took a thundershock dump on the joint. Okay-- so the interior decorators didn't get it right, but the cuisine they most certainly did.    I sit and stare, the sushi plates ride down the conveyor belt at a steady pace.  Sushi predator is ready-- I pounce on my prey grabbing all plates in proximity! GARB-Nom-Nom-Buuuurp! My fix is over in a matter of minutes!  Whew. Glad I didn't have to wait for a 40 minute sit followed by a 40 minute wait. (Yes RA, I'm talking about you!)    The sushi is by no means something Chef Yamamoto conjured up, but is certainly far beyond store bought.  It's good sushi at a cheap price in an environment that was painted by a blind man.  Terrible color Teharu..terrible."}
{"text":"This place is great if you're in the mood for sushi and don't want to spend a lot of money. It's also ideal if you're in the mood for a casual meal with a close friend or friends. If you're thinking date night, the ambiance is not terribly romantic but the  conveyor belt makes the whole experience fun!"}
{"text":"Bomb food and drinks here but the best part is how cheap the bill is after a feast  I highly recommend the cheesy mussels and haru poppers."}
{"text":"I have been to many conveyor belt sushi joints before (San Fran, Dallas, Seattle and Okinawa) and I have to give it to Teharu, they have been the cheapest yet. Cheapest isn't always the best in this case. We came in with a group of 4 including our 4 month old son and we sat in the main area right away. It was Sunday afternoon and so there was no big crowd at all. They had a pretty good selection on the conveyor belt but was shocked to see yogurt, orange juice and cheesecake among others that did not belong there. The sushi was OK but what really brings them down in my eyes was their server. While my wife was chowing down, she picked up some ginger from her plate and found hair wrapped around the ginger. We signaled to the server (younger Asian female) but she was busy tending to other guests and finally after a good 5 minutes she came to our table and we informed her of what we found. We showed her the ginger piece and without expressing concern she just says \"Oh, I'm sorry\". Grabs the plate and walks away. We simply wanted her to acknowledge the fact that yes these is HAIR wrapped around the ginger and they maybe they need to check on their products before setting them on the table. The ginger did not come from the conveyor belt but was brought out from the back. Maybe if they practiced more attention to detail, this would not have happened. We were doing the restaurant a favor by bringing it up and she had something stuck in her behind and did not care at all. It was almost like we made her mad. PLEASE stay at home if you have other issues in your life but don't bring it with you to work because you can ruin other people's day and experience from your business. Thank you but never again."}
{"text":"Tonight I give Tahari ONE star. I don't know which is worse the music or the neglectful service. The sushi was 'meh.' I now believe Sushi Station, while much more expensive per roll is A LOT better than this place. This place wouldn't know good presentation if it fell on them. The rolls are sloppy and unappealing. But what do you expect when the most expensive plate is only 2 bucks? You get what you pay for. Now if they'd just turn up the volume on the obnoxious music, maybe I'd come back... Nah, probably not."}
{"text":"Found a roach leg on my tuna today!!!!! The service here has always been terrible and the food seemed good enough for the low price. But after finding bug body parts on a my food that was just cut once with a knife I'll never be back and it made realize just how filthy this place is!"}
{"text":"Where can you get fresh Sushi/Desserts/Drinks for 2 for UNDER $20?..Teharu!  Loved the 'casual' atmosphere and ability to grab plates off the conveyor belt at whim.   Everything we tried was delicious, including the Cream Puffs we had for dessert!  We left totally satisfied and the check was $16.00! I highly recommend Teharu and will definitely return next time I have a taste for Sushi!"}
{"text":"Wonderful idea and location. Terrible staff. 20 people waiting and the 2nd half of the sushi bar isn't open. I would rather have bad service and be eating than sitting at a table and have nothing. Please think about how you chose to run your restaurant. I would think you would want the sushi made to be sold than to be on the conveyer belt for 20 minutes. And now it's a waiting game. Ugh"}
{"text":"I love this place! Food is amazing price is amazing!such an amazing Lee great place to come for lunch or dinner your in and out pretty quick to people to meet for 30 bucks or less just a great place to go"}
{"text":"Affordable. More like cheap. I come here for cheap sushi. You absolutely can't expect fresh sushi with many different choice of fish but here is perfect for a light lunch. As for service, Jie was amazing but we got an impression that she was the only one that was the right fit for a sushi place. Energetic and young. Or maybe I can't be the one to judge. Too much rice for the size of the slices of sashimi but again, can't complain for that price."}
{"text":"Teharu is the shit, if you're looking for cheap delicious sushi that comes to you (on a conveyor belt) then this is your sushi house! Most plates are under $2 and have 4 rolls on them with an excellent variety of American sushi staples (California roll, Las Vegas roll, etc...). They also have many traditional Japanese favorites as well as a full order off menu if you're not feeling the conveyor belt. I have become a total regular of this excellent establishment and don't plan on changing that anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is a great place for cheap, tasty sushi. I'm a simple girl, when it comes to sushi, so I appreciate being able to come here and eat with someone else and it be 20 bucks most of the time. For both of us. I think that's pretty rad. I live next door, so I go here 2-3 times a week. Never have I seen anything gross or weird, or gotten sick, or had any concern of getting sick. Shaggy dog roll is my favorite, and as far as conveyor belt places go, you will be hard pressed to find a better one in AZ. Check them out."}
{"text":"I used to really love this place, but it has honestly got less clean and the quality of the sushi has dropped. I really hope they start cleaning the conveyor and underneath the tables. Also, Sushi seems to fall apart a lot easier and is not presented as well most of the time. Other than that, I really do love this place and it has good prices."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Teharu for around 5 years. We now like this location better,  its cleaner. The haru sushi is fantastic, be sure to try the iced green tea and the haru hand rolls are also amazing. Service is spotty, sometimes good, but at this location seems understaffed at times.  Only thing that ever bothers me is they need to do more thorough cleaning of the resturant every day."}
{"text":"Sooooo.... Just left this restaurant with my friend. We were in the area and saw the high reviews on Yelp. The decor was nice, bit that's the only nice thing that I can say. The purpose of sushi is for it to taste fresh and to be made to order. However when there are numerous plates revolving around, becoming room temp, it does not make for a good dining experience. We tried the lobster roll and I've never seen lobster that looked like tuna and tasted like one would imagine how cat food would taste. So, we decided to order off the menu in the hopes that it would be fresher since it was just made. WRONG!!! The tuna roll was warm and the Philly roll smelled \"fishy\". We literally left everything untouched.  This was the worst dining experience I have had since being in Arizona for three years. I def would advise any and everyone to stay away from this place unless you are looking for a fast food version of sushi."}
{"text":"$2 per plate for sushi! Great way to try lots of different types, loved this place and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend sat for 45 minutes with no service along and entire row of ignored people. When people complained, they had the nerve to laugh at them and then not expect them to walk out. We placed an order and waited as we watched the first belt get served. We watched as one of the chefs lick his fingers and then resumed rolling sushi with the same gloves. Eventually I had to get up and grab sushi from the first belt before it got soggy and old. The server then came over to laugh at us for grabbing our own food, then over charging us and the icing on the cake: SAID I SHOULD TAKE MY SHIRT OFF!! We left and the only other people on our side of the belt to stay still weren't served in that hour and we were sat after them. I won't be returning to this location. It's sad to say their quality had dropped to this extent."}
{"text":"I wish you could rate food and service separately!  The food is a great value. But the servers are so lazy the only way you could get worse service is to have a 4 year old child who doesn't speak your language try and help you.  My granddaughters love this food.  I would be here more often if they could figure out how to wait on their customers.  Please comment and follow me for more reviews! I would love to have you!"}
{"text":"Great food great prices!  Don't miss the haru sushi roll it is fantastic. You won't find it on the conveyor belt, you have to ask for it!!  Same name as the south location, but this place is WAY better.  Service matters.  I am sad it is so far away from me.  Please comment and follow me for more reviews! I would love to have you!"}
{"text":"Best friend called and said Teharu? I said Hell yeah! If you haven't been to this place, let me advise you if you are searching for RA or Blue Wasabi( which is my fav place)  grade rolls & prices then this isn't your place. This place is fast, fun and cheap, that's right cheap and your food is on a conveyor belt!! How cool is that?? You pay by the plate and the most expensive plate is 2 bucks! They have a variety of sushi that can please anyone's appetite. I have to say my top 2 favs are the Haru Poppers, which is crab salad mix stuffed into a jalapeno & dipped in tempura batter & fried (oh sweet heaven!)  and the Haru roll, crab salad mix wrapped in tuna with acovado on top (melt in your mouth good!) I also like the spicy tuna rolls, Vegas rolls, krab rolls, philly rolls, and of course the Cali rolls and edamame. Also they have cream puffs & cheese cake and other various things beside sushi on the belt.  They also have Sake & beers & sodas & teas.  At Teharu you can get full on sushi and barley put in a dent in your wallet!  Sometimes you have to wait for seating, I have come during lunch rushes & dinner rushes and had to wait both times, also when waiting on your check can be time consuming as well. But over all this place has a cool vibe to it and its fun. If you havent tried it, you should."}
{"text":"This location has just become too dirty! If you look under the tables and look at the fans there's just so much dust and dirt on there that it makes you not hungry. You would think after they failed their Maricopa County health inspection several months ago they would've cleaned it up but they have not."}
{"text":"This restaurant is clean and the service is good.  The sushi revolving around is fresh and if you don't see what you want you can ask the waitress and the sushi chef will make it.  I used to go to the one on priest but it is very dirty."}
{"text":"Sushi at an affordable price and on a conveyer belt which you can see what you get before you order! Vegas roll and dragon roll is zee best I love it here..i don't know that much sushi places where I can get full off of under 10 bucks. #winning! I just wish they had one closer in Mesa!"}
{"text":"The service was okay but the food was terrible. We arrived at 10pm (they close at 11pm) and our favorite rolls were not available so we asked the server and she checked her watch (10:25pm) and said oh ok. We thanked her when she brought them back and she was a little short with us explaining it was last call. The rolls that we ordered and the ones we took off the belt were all terrible. The fish wasn't fresh. Even the edamame wasn't great and I'm not sure how you mess that up. This may have been just because it was the last hour of the night but it ruined it for us permanently. We won't be back. If you decided to go, definitely go earlier in the evening. The saving grace is that it's crazy cheap. The plates were $1.50 and $2.00. I would rather pay a little more for food I can enjoy."}
{"text":"The service is pretty bad. Like be prepared to wave them down for anything you need or want.   Much of the sushi is cut poorly and unevenly. It is difficult to pick up because of some of the poor cutting.   Many pieces were very dry. Some bland.   The selection was hot and cold. At moments there would be a great selection of new pieces and then they'd disappear never to return...all the while the same old California rolls went by again and again on the conveyor belt.   Keep the selection alive and I'd be back."}
{"text":"Super cool place for starving college students to go on dates, or just with friends... It's amazing how much sushi you can get for incredibly low prices!  The sushi was good.  Not the best I've ever had, but Okay.  What makes it fun is the conveyor belt delivery.  You CAN order off the menu, too, but the service seemed super slow.  Probably best to snag it off the revolving selection.  A friend took me here, and I liked it a lot."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great sushi, great prices and friendly staff. Can't wait to go again!!  Sushi conveyor belt with several options. If they don't have it on the sushi conveyor belt they will make it for you!!"}
{"text":"This place is Great. I always get the Haru poppers when they pass by."}
{"text":"Teharu rocks. Have been to both locations and can say it is a great value for sushi lovers. By no means is it top quality sushi but it is palatable and tasty for sure. Also, great prices on beer. I highly recommend going during lunch because it gets super busy during dinner time."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to go during the rush times of the day. During slow times, the food on the belt typically is not fresh (rolls that are suppose to be hot are cold and rolls that are suppose to be cold are room temperate or worse) but you can just place an order instead in those cases. When it is fresh, it's amazing. Their specialty: Haru, unagi, squid salad, and gyoza are my favorites here. I've been to 7+ conveyor belt sushi places and this has been the best at the lowest prices. Great value and the staff has always been friendly and typically are attentive. My drink is usually never empty as a result. Love it!"}
{"text":"A friend and I were the only ones in the restaurant at 11:20 AM on a Saturday -- I guess sushi isn't a brunch thing. The low prices of sushi plates drew me in, and two tall Asahi beers later, it started getting busy around noon. I tried almost everything that was on the conveyer belt, and my favorites here were the Hawaiian roll and Crunchy roll (they put delicious little fried onions on top). The nigiri salmon is priced at $1 a plate, which is a steal. The yellow tail, albacore nigiri, and gyoza also tasted good. Teharu is definitely a value priced sushi joint that has a lot to offer if you're a fan of nibbling on a variety sushi while dining. But die-hard sushi connoisseurs will probably not be impressed. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"I am a fan, quick easy service, you get what you pay for. Good revolving belt sushi. I am a regular and they treat me well!"}
{"text":"This place is LEGIT! Good food and a captivating atmosphere. The conveyer belt kept a portion of my attention throughout dinner as I searched for my next plate. I am 6'4\" and about 230 lbs. I can put down some food... It was only about 20 dollars to eat my fill! Yeah you read it right: good food, good price, good time! Thanks Teharu, I will be coming back. I also heard there is a new location opening in Mesa in a month or so."}
{"text":"Love this place! Being able to take what you want off the belt is amazing. My kids loooooove this place! It's super inexpensive too! For all 4 of us with drinks it's under $30! Great place!"}
{"text":"love this place easy go to good for simple date nite cheap sushi  DO NOT EXPECT TOP SHELF SUSHI WHEN IT IS $1 OR $2 however best best best vegas roll i have had anywhere ever we eat sushi everywhere we go (sister will not eat red meat and we travel as family alot)  dope sakebomb deal"}
{"text":"If you would like inexpensive sushi, this is the place to go, but know that sometimes, you'll be waiting a while for the type of sushi you want to come around ((example: my roommate loves the tempera shrimp sushi and sometimes, they don't put it on the belt until after we've been there for a while))"}
{"text":"Think of it as a sushi buffet.....on a conveyer belt.   Many choices for rolls and some nigiri options. A casual environment coupled with their saki bomb special makes for a fun night."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday and it was surprisingly busy. We had about a 20 minute wait, not bad. Nice variety of sushi ranging from crunch roll, crab roll, las vegas, etc. Best feature is of course the revolving sushi. I remember the first time I came here I thought it was the coolest thing. The prices for the sushi is pretty reasonable. I got a crunch roll, shrimp tempura roll, bake scallop roll, and baked mussels. The baked scallop and baked mussels were special orders you have to tell the waiter and it was well worth it for me because I ordered a few of them and they were delicious!!  The customer service was pretty good and they were nice and polite. A downside I can think of is that their revolving sushi is usually bigger. So, I don't know if it's because it was a weekday and maybe there are bigger parties on the weekend. Overall, I liked it, not a bad place to bring a date. Good service, good sushi/food, price ain't that bad, and I can see myself coming back here."}
{"text":"This has been our go to sushi spot for a few years now. The plate prices are $1, $1.50, and $2. I've never been disappointed or left hungry. My favorite dish is the Teharu sushi which is crab meat wrapped with a slice of ahi and topped with avocado, no rice."}
{"text":"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: This is a great hidden gem.  Teharu is not your typical North Scottsdale frilly and fuss sushi bar.  It's low key and extremely easy on your wallet.  If you are looking for fancy, this is NOT the spot that will satisfy you.  If you are looking for inexpensive sushi, this is your spot.  They utilize a conveyor belt system to deliver fresh sushi throughout the restaurant.  We were not familiar with this method and by the time we had pulled a few items off the belt and finished them, we flagged down a waiter to find out how to keep track of what we had already eaten.  It turns out that the plates are color coded with each color representing a set price. Blue = $2.00, Green = $1.50 and Yellow = $1.00  My favorite item on yesterday's visit was the Haru Popper.  Essentially, it is a jalapeño popper filled with \"krab\" and cream cheese.   The location is easy to get to.  Teharu is located on the north east corner of Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd at the 101 Freeway.  Parking can be sparse during lunch hours.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"At Teharu you get what you pay for - which is $2 sushi. It's not the most amazing thing in the world, but for the price it's a decent experience. The conveyor belt is the main draw-in factor for me, but the food and service does leave a little to be desired. It's not exactly fresh all the time, but it's alright. There are better sushi places out there, but if you want a cheap meal that's decent, Teharu is the place for you."}
{"text":"Excellent affordable. Clean friendly. Great fish. Yummy miso and a hot menu if you prefer noodles or tempura. All at wonderful prices, not much ambiance. If they added a little style they would be packed to the rafters. I think the last houR of lunch....2-3 pm should be 1/2 off all revolving sushi. It does go bad you know.   I love the staff, always cherry happy friendly runs around like lunatics to get you want you want.  They must be very happy at work, it shows."}
{"text":"Another Yelp find, it is one of the conveyor type sushi bars. I went pretty much right when they opened so I thought it would be okay. Was seated and ordered my iced green tea. Most of the items on the conveyor were rolls, basically California rolls with various toppings. I tried one with salmon topping. The salmon was not the freshest. After awhile, hamachi came by and it was not fresh at all, I can tell from my 10+ years working in the fish industry. Each one is different which is indicated by the color of the plate, ranging from $1.50-$3.00."}
{"text":"Love this place for a quick lunch! Just make sure you arrive before 12:00 or else you'll be waiting in line. Food quality is pretty good. Only complaint is that their conveyor belt menu hasn't changed in years - would be nice to see some new items."}
{"text":"We first heard about Teharu from our oldest daughter after she had lunch here with a few of her friends. We are originally from Hawaii and have been living in Arizona for 10yrs now and we love to eat sushi. Its been 2yrs now that we have been going here for our sushi fix. But that is the only reason we do go here. If other sushi places we go to were closer we would go there instead. The service is not so great not sure why they haven't fixed it. The food that is served is okay, wish it was better quality."}
{"text":"The sushi selections are available even if you don't see it on the conveyor belt. Just ask. Plates are fresh and not bad for the price. Great place to try multiple items without breaking the bank or wasting too much if you don't like it."}
{"text":"So I have been going to Teharu for about 2 years. I remember when there short lines and delicious sushi for a great price. At some point and time they started counting on quantity over quality. The portions got smaller and smaller, to the point where I went this evening and the salmon was literally paper thin. So essentially prices are the same but you get less. What?!  Service was not great as it felt like it was understaffed (big difference from the first time I went there).  The worst thing was the cleanliness. Tonight was the first time that I saw plates on the conveyor belt without covers on them, which was a big gross out factor for me.  I will not be going back until they fix the quality of the food and the service to the old standards of the past."}
{"text":"Teharu has been my spot for a sushi fix for about three years now. Every time I go here the sushi just gets better and better! Teharu greets you with a large conveyor belt filled with a colorful variety of sushi. From California rolls, to tuna, to las vegas, to edamame--teharu sushi has it all and all of it is fresh! They have several staff in the center of the conveyor belt preparing new sushi every few minutes! If you see something on the menu that you haven't seen come acrosd the conveyor belt they can make it for you.   I love that their plates are color codded so you can easily see how much each plate is and how much money you are spending--which probably is not much. I usually spend no more than $10- $12 and I am stuffed. But, be warned sushi does not last in your stomach long, so be prepared to take some take out with you! They have a full menu filled with not only sishi, but a variety of teriyaki and rice dishes.  This will continue to be my go to sushi spot whenever I am in AZ!!!"}
{"text":"Teharu is a great place to go if you want some inexpensive sushi. It is conveyer belt style with lots of options to choose from. That being said, there are some guidelines that I recommend following to ensure you get fresh sushi.   #1-anything fried, which should be hot, you should definitely order fresh... unless you actually see them put a new line of plates out on the conveyer belt. You can do this by asking one of the waiters/waitresses, or the cooks behind the counter.   #2- don't grab the last of anything. To me, that means it has gone around a few too many times. Again, if you saw them put it out, the rule doesn't apply.   #3- go during a busy time of day. Yes, you'll probably have to wait a little bit for a seat. But the sushi is being turned over faster.   #4- there's a secret menu! I recommend the volcano roll. Careful though, it comes out hot!   No, this is not my FAVORITE sushi place out there,  because the quality isn't the highest. But when I want to get my sushi fix on a dime, this is the place I go."}

{"text":"Terrible service. I called ten times no answer for a pick up order. My girlfriend went in to order and they sat there while the phone rang. Nobody even helped my girlfriend she ended up leaving. I'm very angry won't ever be going here again."}
{"text":"Sub par sushi and sub par service. It was cheap but so what. Not worth the money waited for something fresh and finally ordered off menu and it was sub par."}
{"text":"I really do love coming here, not for the service which is a little slow but they are still very kind. The food is awesome for the price point and I have never had anything poor in flavor or taste/quality. The conveyor-belt is super fun!!"}
{"text":"This place is great if ur looking for a cheap sushi place!! Been coming to this place and as far as I knw this place hasn't let me down... if u come here in the weekend come early coz this place is always pack!! Especially if ur with a big group u might wait longer than smaller groups... but if u love sushi u should give this place a try... it's cheap and it's really good:)"}
{"text":"They sell very cheap sushi but at the expense of having better quality fish. Teharu is great for a quick stop in if you aren't looking to pay that much. I grew up eating sushi, so I could immediately tell it was not as fresh as 90% of other Scottsdale sushi bars. The staff is decent, but they usually are understaffed so service isn't great. It's a different fun meal, but for food quality, you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Really good. So far i like it more than the one on Priest in tempe. The conveyor belt is awesome plus this location puts signs of what the items are. If theres a roll you want they'll make it. The lady told me on weekdays it gets slow after 1pm. So you might have to request an item. Its no biggy. Staff is everywhere so finding someone isnt hard. Very good prices too."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while since they received a D rating. Ordering the food over the phone was fine as always. The staff can not multi task. You'll be waiting there for a while until they finish a task and then they move on.   Now to the food. I usually get specific rolls because my spouse is highly allergic to shrimp. He comes rushing in my room asking me if the Crunch roll has shrimp. Their menu says avocado. But there was shrimp in the avocados place. Luckily he didn't swallow it so it was minor itching.   Because of that huge mistake I will no longer be going to this location. It has proven that they are going down hill and just don't care about anything anyone."}
{"text":"Thought I would try this place despite the reviews. Was sorely disappointed, slow service and I have had better sushi, get what you pay for."}
{"text":"It's been several years so I feel the need to update my review. This is a restaurant that you come to solely for the cheap prices and the ok food. You do not walk in expecting good service or management  so when you do get it, you are pleasantly surprised.   The servers here have more bad days than good days and it's usually reflected in their service and attitude. I think they work long hours and they probably don't get the best tips so their morale is probably kind of low. But they try, I could see them trying at today's visit for the most part.  Some ways to get around this problem is to ask for everything you want the second you are seated, if you are a single Diner ask for two waters instead of just one since refills will be slow to come by usually. Ask for more napkins and wasabi Etc. Getting all these things in the beginning will lower your annoyances later.  The food: You are getting better than supermarket sushi but lower than a regular style sushi restaurant. If you don't want to wait for the conveyor belt, order straight from the chef. I was there for at least 30 minutes and did not see one tiger roll which was a shame because I'm pregnant and most of things that were served had raw fish in them.( I'm not generally a pregnancy food follower but I know enough to not go Raw here. I'll gladly eat the shit out of some Sashimi @ Kabuki though) anyways I could have ordered it from the chef but I really just didn't care too so that's on me.  Some things are just ridiculous like how they don't have enough bowls of ginger per seating, so expect you ask your neighbor for some of theirs.  All in all:  This is a convenient fast food sushi joint that can be enjoyable if you just overlook its quirks- they haven't changed in the years that they have been around -they are not going to change how they run things now. All you can do is change your expectations and just be glad there aren't any roaches running around anymore."}
{"text":"This place is just an OK sushi bar. They have a rolling station with variety of sushi, salad, and deserts and three tier pricing. You can also order ramen or other food from the menu. The sushi is not good quality though and I was not impressed. All sushi on the roll is mentioned on the menu so I could see what I'm picking."}
{"text":"Solid sushi, great concept!  This was my first time visiting a sushi place with the conveyor belt setup. I must say that I really like it. I've always felt like sushi takes so long to come out after ordering it--I can be rather impatient when I'm hungry--and this place has food available immediately.  The sushi itself was pretty good. I tried a wide variety of options, including both rolls and nigiri, as well as the seaweed salad. I think the salad may have been my favorite thing, actually. But I also had the unagi (always a nice finisher, because it's kinda sweet), a rainbow roll (probably my favorite of the rolls I tried), and several other items.They were all well prepared, and I'd be happy to eat more of them.  For most people, this is probably a pretty affordable way to do sushi. For me, I ended up with a stack of blue plates and a bill that was nearly as high as some all-you-can-eat sushi places I've been.  One other thing that I like about this concept is the opportunity it creates to talk to people around you. Sitting at the bar around the conveyor belt, I was right next to people I hadn't previously met, and it was great to be able to talk to them. I like the social aspect of eating, and this definitely offers that opportunity.  Nice and quick for lunch, tasty food, good stuff."}
{"text":"Fun sushi place for VERY inexpensive sushi.  I tried multiple plates, side of miso soup, side of rice.  All were fine, some were good, some were OK.  I've been here 3 times and each time was fun.  It's better to go when they're busy so new items come out.  Multiple staff members were very nice.  That made our visits more fun."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for lunch with co-workers yesterday and it was quick, fun, and inexpensive. Walked in and we were greeted right away and taken to a booth seat on the far side of the restaurant.  It was pretty busy even though it was around 1 p.m. and that's usually a more \"off-time\" for the lunch crowd.   The conveyor belt was right next to me and it was neat to watch as things passed us by. There were plates with small signs that let you know what each item was as it came up. The only thing I can say negative about this is that it doesn't tell you what's in the item, just what the name of it is, so if you are adverse to anything in particular, you may need to ask a server what goes in it.  The waitress was really nice and friendly and they seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs. I had two of the rainbow roll, some gyoza, and a crab roll plate. Everything was tasty.  The eel sauce that is on the table was good on everything - I recommend you try it!  Overall: A I'm sure I'll head back with co-workers since the hubby has a shell-fish allergy! For the price it's a great lunch deal!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Food is perfectly priced.  It  is not the fanciest of places, but it's fast, inexpensive and staff is friendly.   This is not your standard sushi place, but that is why it's perfect, you can get plenty to eat under 20 bucks."}
{"text":"MOSHI MOSHI!  Great spot for sushi with friends or by yourself.  If you've never had sushi before, this would be the place to try it out.  The portions are small, the price is affordable, and the sushi is conveyed.  Teharu is a must for the sushi enthusiast."}
{"text":"This place is fun because of the conveyor belts... but it sucks when you have to wait an eternity to get seats. If you can call ahead then do so! The good thing about it being busy is fresh sushi but the downside is waiting forever to get those rolls. If you can't find what you want you can always order it which is nice. I think the prices are decent, most plates are $1.5-$2 for 4 pieces of sushi. Do not go there on a Sunday night... I feel like that is when the sushi looks like it has been sitting out for awhile. I won't say it is the greatest sushi but for the price it is just fine. I do love the \"harupoppers\" though but I'm not sure if those count as sushi."}
{"text":"I went here about s month ago as I was craving sushi. It's been awhile since I have had conveyor belt sushi and they do it pretty well. I have never been to one of these places where they have the fried roles on the belt. Staff seemed a little overwhelmed and it wasn't that busy but all in all they did well and the food was great."}
{"text":"We used to love this place customer service has always been bad but the good was good. Now both are horrible and gone way down hill. My daughter asked for a cold drink since the one on the conveyer belt was warm . The waitress told her it was cold enough.  Don't bother ordering off the menu if you get the chance they food will never be brought to you."}
{"text":"Food is average, but cheap. Usually quick in/out if you are wanting sushi without spending your weekly allowance.   Service is awful. No, it is worse than awful. If it were any worse, it would be because they had no employees....actually that might improve service.   We go here often because it is close, cheap, and satisfies the crave for sushi on a weeknight when you don't feel like fast food.  Did I mention service is bad??? Cause it is BAD."}
{"text":"I really hate saying this because I absolutely love the Teharu out in Scottsdale on Frank Loyd Wright, but this one was abhorrent. Cold dish warm, warm dishes cold, rolls are complete slop today. They are smashed looking and have sauce just spooged any/every which way. No no no attention to appearance of the food here today. The toppings are all over the place instead of being placed nice and neat. This was by far the worst Teharu experience I've had and will not be returning to this specific Teharu. Go to the Scottsdale location, you will thank yourself."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is cheap!  This was my first experience at a revolving sushi restaurant.  I think this place is great for a quick sushi fix.  Its not super high quality sushi, but its definitely good and inexpensive.  My only complaint was it literally took us over 30 minutes to get our bill.  We waited and waited and waited.  Its a good thing the food is available on demand, because the rest of the service was very slow."}
{"text":"I have been to other Teharu sushis in the valley and they are better than this one. The service is poor, didn't refill our waters once, and the sushi selection was very poor. Would not return."}
{"text":"This place is great. Sushi is always fresh and they are made right in front of you. I really like the layout of the place too. Tables around the convey belt and then there are tables on the sides as well. Food is delicious too and it's a great price. It ranges from 1-2 $ per plate. They also have desert as well. There are a lot of parking spots outside as well. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"So, I am out an about on Saturday running errands etc. and I see on of those Sushi places that have the revolving Sushi  Bar... I get so stoked because it's quick and easy sit down , eat , and get out.. I'm thinking perfect!. Walk in and there's about 8 people in front of me for a seat at the bar. So, I figure,  ok so what ..I'll miss out on the experience of the revolving tuna roll express and suck it up at a sit down table. I approach the host and say \"hi, I would like a table since the bar is busy, looks like your wide open.\" She replies \"15 minute longa wait, that side of restaurant closed\" I'm like WTF! REALLY? all this business sitting around and THAT SIDE IS CLOSED??? I just stormed out and went to smash burger... ugh"}
{"text":"This place has absolutely the worst table service. When I walked in, no one acknowledged me. I walked in and sat myself and was ignored for the first 15 minutes until someone came and got a drink order. After that, no one checked in on me for an hour. I barely got my check 45 minutes after I was done eating and I waited an extra half an hour for someone to come and get it. Don't eat at this location unless you feel like spending your entire night waiting for service. Not only that, but the same food stayed on the turn style belt the entire time I was there without being replenished so the food sat and got old. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Sushi is one of the foods that you really get what you pay for usually...especially living in a place where you're no where near fishing areas.  But hey, I'm a college student and I like to get my low fat sushi fix on a $10 budget sometimes. I'll rate it for what it is: fun and cheap with not the best sushi, but it'll do. If you're not used to revolving sushi places (lots and lots in California), 90% of the time sushi left standing there rotating is not going to fresh and warm. Although fun, if you want sushi a little bit colder you're going to order it from the chef. You're just going to the get the most basic variety of sushi here, and it's mostly the lower grade fishes.   However, it's recipe for fun for groups: cheap instant sushi and Japanese beer readily available. Oh and guess what? J-pop and Anime music playing in the background! As far as service, this place is consistently packed whenever I go, so expect service to be slow.  Bottom line: Cheap fun with friends, but you get what you pay for....not that great of sushi, but it's price is enticing for any poor student such as myself."}
{"text":"I'm originally from the east coast myself, and can truly say this is by far the best Sushi restaurant i've ever been too! The staff is all super nice. the food is ALWAYS FRESH! and it's quick service with anything you do order from the kitchen. Other then that they have so many different types of sushi to choose from, and if the sushi you want isn't on the moving track you can just order from the cooks. Their prices are amazing the most expensive piece of sushi is about $2.00 which I'm not sure where else you can find sushi this cheap, fresh, and yummy! I defiantly recommend this restaurant to any sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"Revolving Sushi bar and Fine Japanese dining~ That's what the sign says.  Cool little color coded plates of sushi ride around on a moving belt before your eyes. Small portions make it easy to keep grabbing plates, then they add up the colors at the end and bring your check.  White= $1.25 Yellow=$ 1.75 Green=$ 2.25 Brown=$ 2.75 Black=$ 3.25  There is everything from Egg to shrimp and tuna etc. in 2 pieces and all kinds of rolls in 4 pieces, even little desserts go by. Also a small menu with tempura ,teriyaki, salads etc.  Don't see what you want? Just ask and they will make it appear!  I had a crunch roll and tuna avocado roll and an order of tuna (see pics) + drink and a tip was only $10.  Was the sushi Good? ~ it was OK (for $2 I can't complain), I liked the crunch roll, the tuna wasn't cut properly with the grain so you couldn't easily bite a piece off.  I don't know that they should be calling themselves  \"Fine Dining\" it's about as FINE as McDonald's if you know what I mean.  Don't go here here for quality sushi or atmosphere, go because you want sushi and only have $5 bucks to your name.  2.5 stars"}
{"text":"The sushi is alright , its nothing amazing. I really like the idea of revolving sushi that is extremely cheap. I tend to eat here fairly often because its extremely close to where I work and I'm not a huge fan of the surrounding fast food places. I do have to say I like the Scottsdale location better than the one in Tempe. Service here is hit or miss, everyone is extremely friendly however."}
{"text":"Have been here over 30 times with my spouse. Sometimes there is a long wait, but I promise it is worth the wait. I am a fan of spicy tuna, philly rolls, and pot stickers, this place makes the best! One time we went and the sushi seemed lack luster, I can't really explain it....but it was only the one time and every time we have been back since it's been wonderful!"}
{"text":"One of our favorites...fun atmosphere, delicious sushi for a reasonable price and nice wait staff!  It's quite a popular spot; usually pretty busy.  Love!"}
{"text":"The jalapeño roll (Haru Popper) was a 5 star dish.  Everything else was a three star combination of crab salad and thinly sliced fish with some kind of pinkish sauce on it.    This is by far the quickest and best alternative to any fast food options any where!"}
{"text":"The reason I am giving 4 stars is not because this is the best sushi in the valley. This was my first conveyor belt sushi experience. I was happy to see that most of the rolls had a cover over them. ( This was a concern of mine) SO..the Four stars-there were several really great rolls and the fresh tuna was AWESOME. Some of the selections were just ok, but still worth eating. There were 3 of us that night and we all got stuffed- to the MAX- for 27 dollars- TOTAL! The price is right, the food good and we all had a great time choosing the rolls and trying different selections. Definitely would visit again."}
{"text":"If you want to try something different in the world of sushi and spend $15, come to Teharu! Don't expect the sushi to be super amazing, but know that you'll have fun.   Teharu is a conveyor belt sushi restaurant. It's not ideal for groups, as you'll be sitting at a sushi bar, so just invite your significant other and go have fun! The pricing is based on the color of the plate, so you can spend as little as $1 or as much as $100, but I average about $15-$20 a visit (including tip and drink).  The quality sushi is average - don't expect anything super fresh or new to show up on the conveyor belt. It may be a great place to take a sushi newbie, as there are a TON of options they create for little cost upfront. The portion sizes are smaller too, so this may be a great chance for you to try sushi you may not have been willing to spend $15/roll on."}
{"text":"I would eat at this restaurant every day of the week if I could. I love the idea of the conveyor belt sushi. The prices are insanely reasonable. The selection of food and beverage choices is wonderful. I can't say enough great things about this place. It's heaven.   You are charged per plate of sushi (or whatever) you pull off the belt. At the end, the waitress tallies up your plates. No plate is over $2. You can't beat that!!! Honestly...I love this place. Love it!"}
{"text":"As I'm writing this, all three of us who ate here are moaning in pain. One has gas pains, I have stomach pains and my last friend has a headache. This place is the worst sushi we've ever had. Too much mayo and Krab in the rolls, bland sashimi, not much selection. However, it was dirt cheap. We got what we paid for. Ugh. I actually hope I vomit.  36 hours later: never vomited unfortunately. After going to bed with stomach pains, I woke up with indigestion (a \"sour stomach\") around 4 am. At 4:45, the insanity started--I don't think I've ever had diarrhea like this. I had to lay down close to the bathroom because it was coming out so fast and often.  Next day: diarrhea stopped after taking activated charcoal but the stomach pains and indigestion are STILL HAPPENING. I don't feel good. I'm going to the doctor...maybe she can help.   --------------- After eating here and 10 days of abdominal cramping, diarrhea and indigestion, my stool test returned positive for a PARASITE--Dientamoeba fragilis! You get it from swallowing contaminated feces--in other words, someone working here and preparing food is carrying the parasite and didn't wash their hands. I have to take an antibiotic/parasitic called Flagyl.   --------------- 6 weeks later: I'm on my second round of anti-parasitic drugs (the first round didn't get rid of the parasite completely). I had to order the current medication from Mexico because it's not sold in the U.S. It's called Diodoquin, aka, iodoquinol. It's a common medicine to give in other countries but not here in the U.S. because getting a parasite is not thought to be that common. Perhaps one of the employees who has been to another country recently is infected?  So far, I've spent $580 on doctor's visits, medicines and stool testing so it's not cheap sushi anymore. Take your chances if you want, but all of us got sick. I just happened to end up with the worst reaction. If you want good (safe) sushi, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"teharu gets three stars for the price, the fact that it has a conveyor belt, and the haru roll-crab salad wrapped in tuna with avocado on top. the sushi is meh, i'm not sure why they have servers, and it's usually a wait but it's good every once in a while"}
{"text":"This conveyer belt sushi style restaurant is a new thing to me. I started going to the one in Scottsdale with a friend and I haven't stopped. My top sushi choices here are shaggy dog, rainbow rolls, and Hawaiian rolls. The dragon rolls are really good too."}
{"text":"Ok so the sushi is decent - I mean it's definitely not the best sushi I've ever had but it IS good. The real reason I rated it so high was the experience and price.  It's a lot of fun to sit there with friends and just grab plates as they come by. It's the most adventurous I'd ever been with sushi, since I could SEE it, I felt more confident in grabbing it. It's cool cause each person can keep their own plate stack, which makes it easy to split the bill. Plates range in price from $1 to $2...some things were on two plates so they were *GASP* $3. Between that and the beer special ($4 for a large Kirin light) - it was a steal.   Totally recommend it for a cheap night out with a group of friends!"}
{"text":"Our first time and we loved it. The sushi on the conveyor belt are the more common rolls but really good quality sushi. They also have sashimi, fresh and super yummy. The more special rolls have to be ordered, those were also delicious. Definitely coming back! We ate A LOT and it was inexpensive."}
{"text":"Service is just terrible! No one speaks English and all the \"servers\" are too busy doubling as bussers and hosts to refill drinks or total the bill. Didn't get a single soda refill or the water I originally ordered. Stood for several minutes at the register waiting to be rung up. Foods below average and the service was absolutely the worst I've ever had."}
{"text":"Oh do we love Teharu. If you go at night, there always seems to be a wait. But it's never long. You can start eating as soon as you sit down. Sushi is always fresh as it goes through fast. If you happen to not see what you want on the conveyor, the sushi chefs will make it for you if you ask. Rolls are smaller than if you go to any sushi restaurant, and not displayed prettily, but for $1-$2? What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad, but myself and three of my dinner companions all came down with a severe stomach bug the day after eating here. Considering it's the only thing we came together for in the last week, and all hit the same symptoms around the same time, the deduction can't be far off as to the culprit.   We're still comparing notes as to what we had in comparison to the other four that didn't end up hugging a toilet all night. For now, I'm ringing the bell of warning that you're taking quite the risk going here."}
{"text":"Great place to grab some decent sushi.  It's a revolving sushi bar, so it's best if you're not in a huge group.  If you have 4+ people, they'll seat you at a booth.. otherwise, you're seated next to random people... basically wherever there is room.  Usually there is always a wait, but the wait doesn't last too long.  It's best to come at peak hours because it'll ensure that the plate you're picking off the conveyor belt is fresh.. otherwise.. who knows how long that plate has been sitting around.  Sometime I'll see the exact same plate go around in a circle the entire time I'm there. :/  They have your basics, california roll, spicy tuna, philly, hawaiian, vegas roll, nigiri pieces.. and so on! My favorite is called \"the haru\".  Basically it's imitation crab wrapped with tuna & avocado.  Yum.. I could eat a million of these and I liked it best because it had no rice to it!  The Vegas roll is also pretty good too.  If you want fresh pieces, stick with stuff like rainbow, hawaiian or the nigiri pieces.  & if you dont see something on the belt you want, just ask the sushi chefs to make it for you! That way, it's extraaaa fresh ;)  They also have kitchen food as well, but I never bothered to order any of that.  Mostly because the portions are tiny and overpriced for it.. so I just stuck with sushi :)  Prices are cheap! $1-$3 plates.. but it does add up quick because 1 plate only has a couple pieces to it.  Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Sushi on a belt. I still don't get it. This is the lowest common denominator of sushi quality wise. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Cool revolving sushi bar. Excellent speedy waitress service. Not the highest quality sushi but you definitely can not beat it for the price. My wife and I ate here for less than 20$ and that's hard to do with sushi. It's a very good place to go if you're new to sushi and want to try some new rolls but don't want to spend 11$ for 8 pieces. Go here and get 3 pieces for 2$ and if you don't like it well it was only 2$!     Nice atmosphere and an okay place to take kids."}
{"text":"I simply cannot believe what Samantha G. said!  This place has amazing sushi that's dirt cheap!  Try the one that has crab salad filling with tune wrapped around!  great sushi here included salmon nigiri, tuna nigiri, rainbow roll, I love salmon roll, crab roll.  Mochi ice cream is also amazing here!  It is true the staff didn't attend very much and doesn't speak a lot of English, but at least the food is great with great prices!"}
{"text":"I'm usually a huge advocate for this place but today was just awful. My family and I came in around 410 or so and got sat relatively quick. The server (one of two) brought the plates and I asked her if I could have 2 more small ones without wasabi. She stated that some of the ones she brought had no wasabi on them. I said I know but still needed 2 more. Her reponse?? \"What do you need them for?\" UM really..? I just do. She leaves, returns with my plates and waters. OK so at this point I'm better, but then there's absolutely nothing on the conveyor that my kids will eat so I order 2 crab rolls.. took forever.. OK whatever. My husband and I get a Vegas roll off the conveyor. Frozen. Understandable since it's been going in circles for God knows how long. So we decide to put an order in so it's made fresh. Not so much. They pass it over the conveyor from the bar and still cold. I ask for them to make fresh hot ones because if I wanted them cold I'd get it off the belt. Get eyes rolling. Ordered baked scallop roll. Cold. I mean seriously! So needless to say cancelled everything else I ordered and left. Like I said I LOVE this place normally, but not so much today. Which is a shame since I moved about 40 mins away and decided to come here since we were in tempe.. very disappointing"}
{"text":"The only reason I don't give Teharu 5 stars is because the service is consistently terrible, but you don't go to conveyor belt sushi for an awesome customer service experience - you go because there are rows and rows of all the sushi your fish loving heart could ever desire floating past your table at all times.   The sushi is good. It's your typical, Americanized sushi. If you're looking for super fancy, 100% authentic sushi, this place is not for you. BUT there is a great variety, it's made right in front of you and did I mention it's on a conveyor belt riding past you screaming EAT ME at all times?  The prices are even better. My boyfriend (a 6'4 former defensive end, if that gives you an indication of the size of his appetite) and I's (questioning my grammar on that \"I's there so I hope this is not being graded) bill is usually around $35-$40 and we leave very full. Prices are by plate, $1, $1.5 or $2.   We will go back over and over again."}
{"text":"We come here regularly (since we moved to town few months ago) because this is my son's favorite Japanese restaurant in town. Beside the price is reasonable it's also convenient from where we live.  His favorite items are edamame, tempura rolls, miso soup and the Japanese ramyun soda in strawberry flavor.  I like the spicy tuna rolls and eel rolls. They have really good Japanese green tea as well.  We're kind of disappointed with the service lately because the hostess (male in mid 20s or early 30s) holding so many customers including us at the waiting area and yet a lot of tables and bar table are available. He is the most disorganized hostess ever.  Teharu, please address this problem, thank you."}
{"text":"It's hard to tell what kind of restaurant this is from seeing it when you drive by.  I have a million times and finally a friend told me it was one of those sushi spots that have continuously made sushi on conveyor belts with the color coded plates for price.  Glad I got to try it finally.  It's on the corner of a short strip of stores and restaurants by the FLW exit off the 101 so location was good.  It was about 7 pm on a Wednesday night, Inside was simple, clean, and to the point with the sushi makers in the center of the restaurant and some tables on the left hand side for larger parties.  This is a cool dinner for 2 spot since a lot of the seating is at the sushi bar.  It is also a great option for a party of 1 bc of the portion sizes (most rolls had 4 small pieces) which I am sure I will utilize in the future.  Sushi was good and a great variety.  Favs were Tiger Roll with shrimp on top with a yummy slightly sweet crab mix inside, Baked scallop roll (think it had crab on top too).  There was things like rainbow rolls, dragon rolls, crab rolls, varieties of sashimi,  seaweed salad, squid salad, cucumber salad, varieties of cheesecakes, edamame, some kinds of puffs, and more!  With a party of 2 we had 9 blue plates and 3 green ones plus one sake and the check was only 32$.  We were overstuffed (our eyes were bigger than our stomachs and it's easy to grab a lot fast at first), you can't beat that value.  I wanted to make sure we tipped appropriately since everyone was working so hard and nothing was expensive here.  So we asked and we were told the employees pool from what I understand so please tip generously especially since the items are so low priced :)  Tip for the experience not the percentage on your bill (we tipped a little over $10 which I think was small amount for what we got!)  Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Sushi is great... but conveyor belt sushi is even better. I was excited to try out Teharu Sushi since I have had amazing experiences at other conveyor belt sushi joints, however as another Yelper described it, Teharu is only \"mediocre at best.\" Both the food and service fell way short of my expectations.   I came here with a couple of friends on a Friday afternoon and luckily we didn't have to wait for a table. Upon seating I began to  notice that our waiter appeared to be utterly uninterested. I was hoping the quality of food will make up for the lack of quality of service but sadly things kept going downhill. In my opinion, the sushi selection here is extremely limited. Their rolls are very basic and the size of the roll were smaller than what I was used to. They also offer other items such as cheesecake, packaged pudding, bottled juices, etc., but a conveyor belt sushi restaurant is the last place I expected to see (or purchase) those items. The sushi did not look appealing on the conveyor belt, probably because all of the plates were covered with flimsy plastic lids, which looked very old and were either ripped or cracked. I had 5 plates in total... sadly all of them were lackluster and did not taste fresh. Furthermore the sushi rice also appeared to be undercooked, it was tough and grainy instead of chewy and moist :(  When it was time to get the check, our server stood there for a good five minutes scraping the uneaten food into a plastic lid while we watched in awkward silence. And instead of dropping off the check at our table and coming back after a few minutes so we have time to get our payments ready, he stood there and waited while my friends and I rushed to dig out our money. These may be very small details but it was enough for me to conclude that 'odd' is the best way to describe the service at Teharu Sushi.  My search a good revolving sushi bar in the Valley shall continue."}
{"text":"Ditto on what most people have said.. the sushi is decent but the concept is so much fun! And if you're starving you don't have to wait to order and then for your food to arrive. Just sit down and start grubbing. It's also great because you don't have a true server you have to tip 20% to. We has lunch there today and ate until we were very full... like \"I can't eat another bite full\".. and our bill was $28.50 and $4 of that was drinks.   My main complaint is that the staff seems to hate their jobs. Not rude per se, but pretty curt. Not enough to not go back though."}
{"text":"Given the price, the sushi here has reasonable quality. There is a consistent stream of customers so everything is pretty fresh. If you don't see your favorite roll/nigiri around then you can request them to make it for you at no extra charge. My favorites would be the dragon roll & unagi (fresh water eel)."}
{"text":"Oh Teharu,  I've been here enough times with my classmates to write a decent review.  To start off, I never eat at revolving sushi places when I was in Cali because of the quality. However, due to the lack of options in Mesa and the convenience of Teharu, I've been here more often than I'd like to admit (A girl got cravings okay?)   Parking: not bad, never had trouble looking for parking.   Service: decent, they only have about 2 maybe 3 waitresses at a time. During lunch/dinner rush, service is pretty slow. It's hard to wave them down for a special order roll or refill of water. There is never a wait. So us students can just storm in, grab 1/2 of the food from the belt and clean them out, and come back for class in time.   The FISH: + Prices are fair + Salmon is pretty consistent, I definitely recommend any salmon items + Seaweed salad is always on point + Tamago is yum + HAND ROLLS are a must: spicy tuna or salmon handroll. It can be a hit or miss depending on who's rolling them. But we usually get A LOT of fish in each massive hand roll for $3 each. +White fish/ white tuna is usually good +Vegas roll is pretty decent  -Squids are awful  -Tuna is chewy, not really fresh -Fish quality overall is not consistent and more often than not, it's not as fresh as I prefer.  BUT, Teharu is so convenient and fairly cheap. I will probably find myself here every once in a while to satisfy my fish cravings."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying this used to be my favorite place.  My husband found a baby Cockroach in his sushi roll last night and quickly ran to show our server/manager. They said ew and gave us 92 cent discount. .92?!?!? I know mistakes happen but a bug in our food!?!? SO GROSS! I'm so mad our sushi spot is now ruined for date night. The fact that we had to pay for our full meal is crazy. My husband even said regardless if there was a bug he still would have gone back if the customer service was better. They handled this situation very badly!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch on a Saturday. Even though it was later in the afternoon (after 1) it was still packed. But we only had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated.   The great thing about a revolving sushi restaurant is that you don't have to wait for your food. As soon as you sit down you can start grabbing. We tried several different items -the best were the rainbow roll, the potstickers and the tamago, which is a sweet egg sushi that I'd never had before. Overall the sushi was decent, not the best I've ever had but I wasn't really expecting that honestly.   But it's great because you can eat just as much as you want and you can try new things because it's only a buck or two per plate. I thought it was a ton of fun, the food was decent and it's cheap. A great way to spend a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Super fun place to go out and try all kinds of sushi. Very affordable. Can get super busy but it's worth the wait.  You can order special items if you want."}
{"text":"Have to say that we were beyond disappointed. First, they were out of a couple different types of fish that we ordered. We could have dealt with that if everything after tasted great. We were too afraid to grab anything that came out on the belt because we could tell that most of it was old and far from fresh. The service was subpar as well. It was one of those bad experiences where you leave feeling full yet empty because you paid to eat shit food. I guess it was too good to be true to find a decent sushi place that doesn't break the bank. A bit scarred and don't know if we'll ever be back. Guess we'll be going back to expensive sushi that we know will at least be fresh and won't give us the stomach flu."}
{"text":"Out of the conveyor belt sushi establishments, I'm a fan of the newer Teharu at FLW/101. It's definitely closer to my home than Sushi Station (Desert Ridge), which is a plus!  It was a good sign that we had to wait to be seated at an odd time of 2:30p on a Saturday, IMO. My dad and I sat at the bar which gave us close access to plated sushi whizzing by, waiting to be snagged by eager hands.  I consumed:  *Seaweed Salad: big fan, but don't be afraid of adding more spice! *Rainbow Roll: nicely done! *Spider Roll: THE best and my favorite - nice presentation! *Spicy Tuna: also, a hit *I Love Salmon Roll:  good, but used too much rice.  Dad ate even more than I did, and we each had 2 green teas. Total bill? $27-something. Not too shabby on the purse strings either...  I'll be back for more - Teharu - you have been warned."}
{"text":"Took my son here for his birthday lunch. He loved it!! (So did I!!) The sushi was fresh and tasted amazing! There was a variety to choose from. We will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"Ok... Where do I begin? Decor? Service? Food? Ambiance? Ok let's start with decor...  Conveyor belt sushi... Photographs of customers (probably to supply proof people eat here$ Christmas lights inside on trees in July... Poor hand written signs... Very ummmm ugly dishes.... I must resist to say anymore about the crappy decor...  Service... They lag on refills and place their arms in your face as they are doing so... I tried to order from the list hoping for some fresher?!?!?! Fish... But the Korean chef picked up a old piece and handed it to ne... Thanks for the old fish...  The food... Was ummm... Yeah I'm going to get a sandwich as I am typing this... The fish isn't supposed to be paper thin! Please take the pudding, cheesecake, canned orange, V8 and apple juice off the belt that's hella ghetto...  Sadly this is another poor attempt at Japanese food! If your not Japanese stop trying to fake the funk! I'm Japanese I can tell the difference even though other people can't!"}
{"text":"They have good plates going around and their prices are good too. I've never seen anything that looked like it's been sitting on the belt for too long"}
{"text":"I  love this place, I walk out of there paying $5.99 before tip after ordering Miso Soup, & 3 (half sized) rolls. The Las Vegas roll is amazing, and the Cali roll is also. I literally go here once a week!!"}
{"text":"If you need a sushi fix this is a quick place to grab some plates off the rotating belt. The price per plate is $1-2 and the flip side is you pay for what you get. The quality can be improved. Overall not a bad place for the occasional sushi run"}
{"text":"I came in tonight with my family, and the place was clearly packed (as a good joint should be on a Friday night). We were asked to wait for about 15 minutes which was fine, there was tons of sit-down waiting space, they were playing awesome music, the atmosphere was great, and the whole place smelled AMAZING. We were seated by our waitress at a table, and I have to say from then on our service was amazing. Our waitress was kind, sociable, funny, and very attentive.   Once you are seated, you can pick whatever sushi you want on the conveyer belt beside you and start to eat. The dishes are about half-size orders, which is great because you get to try more, which you wouldn't normally get to do in a restaurant if you are not an avid sushi eater (unlike myself, having grown up in the sushi capital of Canada) and don't know what you'll like. Or if you just want to try new things or have more variety. The rolls were AMAZING quality. I couldn't believe I was eating this quality sushi in the desert. It's hard enough to find good, low-priced sushi ($1-$2/dish) in California (ON THE COAST!!!), let alone in the middle of the freaking desert.  At the end of the meal, they even let us take home the sushi we didn't eat in a take out box with no hassle, which is VERY RARE for sushi restaurants. Usually they CHARGE for uneaten/wasted sushi in this kind of place.   This is obviously not a top tier sit down sushi bar that is best, most expensive quality, but for a great sushi joint to come with the family or on a first date, this place is perfect.   Overall,   food 9/10  service 10/10 atmosphere 8.5/10 cleanliness 10/10 price 15/10 ($40 total for 4 people eating a total of 16 dishes) would recommend YES!"}
{"text":"I love walking into a place and being able to instantly shove food in my mouth without having to talk to another person. I get starving sometimes. These things happen. This restaurant is perfect for me.  Still wonderful sushi, and I come here often: Tip to the wise, you can ask for rolls specifically, like the rainbow roll or the dragon roll. They will make them, hand deliver them, and charge you the same. This goes for anything on the conveyer belt. Don't be afraid to ask!  And they scream, \"irrashai\" when you walk in. Roughly translated, that is Japanese for \"welcome to the store\"."}
{"text":"Really good, extremely reasonably priced sushi. We come here all the time. The only reason I give this 4 stars is because I think the Scottsdale location is way better. The salmon is a lot bigger there. I recommend  the Las Vegas rolls, haru poppers, and baked scallop rolls"}
{"text":"Came to this place after going to the  Chandler location for many years. Obviously, it's not the worlds best sushi, but it's dang cheap and I typically pay around $14 /person and I eat a lot! Like you can get super full. It's really good, and I gave it another star (I gave the Chandler location a 4) because the sashimi is way bigger and super great!!  I recommend the haru poppers, the baked scallop rolls, and the las vegas rolls. If you are a sushi fanatic and looking for some good cheap food, come here!"}
{"text":"Did I just come on a bad night?  It is very hard to believe this is a sister restaurant of the Teharu on Frank Lloyd Wright. I've been going to Teharu in North Scottsdale for the past couple years for my conveyor belt sushi fixes. Didn't feel like driving to North Scottsdale so I went to this location for the very first time.  The quality of the rolls was much shoddier (loosely rolled, far too much rice, not sliced all the way through for clean separation) and there was no organization to the rolls on the conveyor belt. The assortment was also much more sparse--about half of the assortment that North Scottsdale has. The only nigiri they had was Hokkigai and Hamachi; there was no ahi, salmon, unagi, etc.   I will have to time my Teharu fixes for when I go to North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Not bad. I like Sushi Station better, maybe because of the setup it seems more full and busy. Anyways, same set up with the conveyor belt sushi and the colored plates (though I didn't like the patterns and found them less easier to discern than S.S.) Cheap sushi that fills you up."}
{"text":"For what it is its pretty on the money! Much better selection and quality of sushi than the other conveyer sushi spot across from desert ridge. Iced green tea is great. Stuffed our faces and had drinks for 32 bucks. Jackpotttt!"}
{"text":"Wait is way too long. They have half of the restaurant which I rarely see them open up. Food is OK."}
{"text":"The only reason why this place didn't get 5 stars was due to service was slow and the waiters were inattentive. However the food and atmosphere made up for that. One of the best sushi places I've gone to.  The chefs stand in the middle of the restaurant and make the sushi fresh, then place it on a conveyor belt that circles the bar. It's amazing, fun and interactive. They will also make any sushi \"special\" if needed. I tried the asparagus roll, which I've not tried before. It's was so delicious that I ended up having 4. :D The prices are based on the color of the plate you grab. It's a perfect set up. As well as sushi, they have a full menu of items to choose from. I recommend this to ANY sushi lover.  Tip: Get there early and come hungry!"}
{"text":"The conveyor belt concept is great, especially if you're on a time crunch. You can always call out a specialty roll to the sushi chefs, they'll make it right then & there. The waitstaff isn't the greatest but it works for me."}
{"text":"Pros: 1. Affordable prices, pay for color on the plates 2. You choose what you want to eat by looking at it (on the conveyor) 3. Fun place for kids (and adults) 4. Lots of variety and constantly being replenished 5. Lots of parking space.  Cons: 1. It is so busy, you will wait if you have more than 4 people in your group. 2. For picky eaters and folks who don't know much about sushi, it is difficult to know what the ingredients are just by looking at it. 3. Definitely not the best sushi place around, but they said they were. 4. The colors on the plates are not as obvious as they used to be."}
{"text":"I'm definitely not an expert on sushi, but I really don't think sushi short be this cheap. I have no problem with the conveyor belt style sushi; in fact I like those types of restaurants. They are good for trying any different styles of sushi without dropping a massive check.  However, their $2.00 sushi is concerning. I've been here twice, and both times I was very disappointed. The sushi is very simple and lacking in flavor. I know they switch up the selection but both times the selection was all very basic rolls (california, tuna, tempura, etc) and missing some of the more vibrant rolls like Dragon, Las Vegas, Soft-Shell Crab, things like that.  My good friend really loves this place, so I know sushi tastes can be very differed; however I felt they were too basic and would rather spend a little more money for big-flavored rolls over $1 to $4 unimpressive rolls."}
{"text":"I was referred here so I expected something better.  The selection was really poor and the taste was bad.  I couldn't tell if the chefs couldn't keep up or if they just don't offer many selections.  Good prices though."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a conveyor belt sushi restaurant and It was awesome. I really enjoyed the variety and selection. I just wish they had more rolls out. We ate so much sushi and it came out to $35 bucks with tip! I would recommend everyone trying this place at least once."}
{"text":"Cheap! Tasty! FAST! I mean it, as soon as you sit down you can serve yourself off the line. And the hits keep coming."}
{"text":"This place is the best! They make the food right in front of you and then put it on the revolving belt. Prices range from $1-2 per plate. Each plate contains 4-6 rolls of sushi. The food is delicious and it's super affordable. Easy to get to go as well. I've never had an issue, & I come twice a month."}
{"text":"The quality of sushi here is between gas station sushi and your best grocery store sushi, but the price is better than both of those options. Most of the rolls only have one or two ingredients, and are very basic but it satisfies the sushi craving without dropping $50-60 on sushi for two. Teharu says that they're \"fine dining\" but I don't really see that. The seats at the sushi bar around the conveyor belt are very close together, and there's very few actual dining tables. I wouldn't consider any of this \"fine dining\" but to each their own, I guess. The only real con to Teharu is that their servers don't really have to serve you anything, so when you do need something they seem a bit rude. All in all, I think the super low price of food makes everything okay.   If you're a sushi snob and looking for top notch sushi, do not come here. Otherwise, if you don't really care as long as you don't get food poisoning, this is a decent place."}
{"text":"Great variety for a great price.     If you're looking for anywhere to go on a cool dinner date all under $25! This is the place to go! The sushi is really good and they have all kinds! If the sushi you desire isn't on the revolving bar you can always order it but I love the revolving bar as it makes you try out new types that I always end up getting twice."}
{"text":"This place is most definitely a go-to when it comes to sushi cravings. In regards to conveyor belt sushi, I'd rate it four stars. Although the service can be lacking at times, the food and drink is very good. I've had a lot of sushi in my life, and I'd recommend this place."}
{"text":"Warning: Bad sushi makes you really sick  I love sushi and good deals.   But I will not be goin back to this place.  Went w 3 friends to check out this conveyor belt sushi Saw same sushi go around n around n around Picked what we thought looked fresh All got sick that night..  Mentioned it at work Turns out quite a few have tried it and gotten sick there as well  No matter how cheap  NOT worth getting sick over"}
{"text":"I try to go here once a month or so...maybe twice. It's great for lunch, it's never really busy then. TOTALLY love the jalapeno poppers they make, and the gyoza. Pretty tasty rolls all around! Though, those plates can stack up FAST. Love the iced green tea. Sure, it's the same rolls all the time, and it's not top tier sushi, but it's on a conveyor, what do you expect?"}
{"text":"FAVORITE PLACE TO EAT IN ARIZONA. Usually only a wait on friday nights but it's worth the wait. Super cheap! Love it!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I love this place! We used to make the long drive to their Chandler location. We were so excited they opened a new place right by our house.   Small dishes of sushi, rolls, salads and other deliciousness pass by on a conveyor belt - take what you want, when you want it.   The handy menu gives all the info you need to make your choices, such as, certain color dishes have a different price, and description of the dishes. Don't see what you want? Ask the waitress and they'll make it for you.   Teharu is just a fun, casual way to dine out. Staff is very helpful and friendly. For 2 of us, we typically spend around $15-20 for lunch, not too bad for great food and a unique dining experience."}
{"text":"I have been going to Teharu Sushi from the time it opened it was a lot different then. My last few visits were less than stellar. I got a warm piece of fish that made me gag and being cramped in with people stuffing their faces with sushi is not fun. I will not watch people eat for 35 minutes until they decide to leave so I can be seated. When it comes down to it's not a deal."}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times and absolutely love it! I like the revolving sushi, because you can just grab what you want and don't have to wait for anyone to bring it to you. Plus most sushi places I go to, I can only eat two or three different rolls because they usually come with six to eight pieces. Most plates at Teharu come with only four pieces, so I can have more variety. The sushi is great, but sometimes it's better than others depending on what time of day you go. The busier it is, the more frequently they are putting out fresh rolls. The staff is always friendly and constantly refilling drinks. If you love sushi but don't want to spend a bunch of money, then this is the perfect place. My fiancé and I eat a decent amount and it usually costs around $20-$25 including drinks."}
{"text":"If I could give it less than one star I would. What used to be a pretty decent place to grab lunch has since turned to complete garbage. I got food poisoning from this dump last night. The service is complete shit and the attitude of one specific waiter is even worse (Guy with glasses you know who you are) being in the service industry myself makes the fact that this place is so horrible even more of a joke. Honestly I don't care if it never opens its doors again. Idk what happened to this once awesome places but I sure as fuck won't be coming back.   Warning: unless you want to be sick all night and day don't go here."}
{"text":"Someone told me about this place a long time ago but I'd never gotten around to actually going until this week.  To my surprise it's only about 2 blocks away from where I work too!  The seating kinda sucks, especially if you have more than two people.  I was with a group of four and instead of having bar top style seating where everyone is facing the conveyer belt so that they can grab their own stuff, they have actual tables where only two of the four seats are next to the conveyer.  Therefore the people on the outside have to either reach in front of the other people or constantly be asking for stuff to be grabbed for them.  Not ideal.  The sushi itself I would put at average at best.  Everything had a general temperature of lukewarm whether it was something that should have been cold or hot, one of the downfalls of this system I guess.  I will say the cream puffs were delicious though, but really who goes to a sushi place for cream puffs?  The service wasn't great either and I mean I guess that's another flaw in this kind of system, your food comes on the constantly moving belt but trying to get your drinks refilled or get the check was a little bit of a hassle.  Basically I think this is a cool place to come for the experience but this is not a place I would go to when I want some good sushi."}
{"text":"Decent and very inexpensive place (by sushi standards). Great place for the kids to try different types of fish and other raw seafood. One likes the hoki clams, the other the fresh water eel (ok, that's not raw :) ), and both like the miso soup. Fun day."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy going here when they first opened but the last couple visits have been horrible on every level. Our server seemed to be more concerned with his hair than anything else. Food and condiments covered in fruit flys or gnats, so much so other patrons were complaining and making a game of killing the flying insects. The sushi was not fresh by any standard, and the conveyor was only half full with a very limited selection. I will not be going back, ever."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! I go there about 3 times a week. It's fast (when I'm alone the entire experience takes maybe 20 minutes). Great prices, friendly staff. Couldn't ask for anything more!"}
{"text":"First of all, the sushi gets the job done. I wouldn't say its the best sushi I have ever tasted but it wasn't horrible.   What they need to improve on is their service. I felt bad for the waitress working because she was the only one there. Obviously, she could only do so much if she's by herself. They management needs to hire more waiters/waitresses to make sure service is fast."}
{"text":"Well this is the nicest sushi place I have been to for a while.. 3rd time here and bathrooms are complete disaster. A gas station bathroom is cleaner .. Then it took 45 mins to sit two ppl.. And after all that the conveyor belt didn't have anything on it .. Ppl are mad .. It really needs to learn how to serve better food service cuz .. They won't get my business again.. 30min for one roll that's pathetic"}
{"text":"We visit this location often, but today I was very disappointed.  We placed an order for over $25.00 becasue the sushi we wanted was not on the conveyor belt.  I had to ask for our order 3 times.  It took the lady making the sushi over 25 mins to do 6 orders of egg.  I noticed that she was busy talking to the men on the other side of the sushi bar and was not filling our order.  It is to bad becasue the sushi is reasonable."}
{"text":"Teharu is a great place to go to get your all you can eat sushi fix.  They have a good variety going around on a regular basis, and you can always order your favorite while you wait and gorge on the other offerings. Weekend evenings are very busy so plan ahead."}
{"text":"Always good food and service. Fast during off peak times and so much healthier. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Have been coming here regularly for a year now- you just can't beat the price. Lunch hour is a little hectic since they are seemingly understaffed, but I still love this place regardless. The chefs remember my order and are so fast! There are new sushi options on the conveyor belt almost ever 10 minutes. Absolutely LOVE the Haru Sushi and Shaggy Dog Roll."}
{"text":"This place was so fun.  The atmosphere is wonderful  during workday lunches.  The prices are great and the food is pretty good.  I will definitely be back because I had such a good time and there is a wide variety to choose from."}
{"text":"Well it certainly is cheap. This place has a conveyer bringing around sushi and the cost is determined by what color plate you get. We were both full after $22!  Normally that would be $50 at a regular sushi place.   Decent variety of rolls. Normal yellow tail and tuna selections. All good there. Not huge cuts of fish but considering the price, it makes sense. It doesn't taste newly prepared but close. I suppose you really don't know how long something has been going round and round. You can sit at a table and order off a menu. I can't comment on the sushi there. I didn't do that.   It's a bit of a cafeteria feel. Matches the super cheap price.   Service fell short. It was not easy getting a drink or paying our tab. We almost got up and brought our dishes to the cashiers and had her price it out. Horrible service.   Overall though, it satisfies your sushi craving on a budget if you don't much care about the experience. So elsewhere with a date."}
{"text":"The best sushi bar I've been too.  You can custom order rolls , ask for them to make fresh stuff  And there's even cream puffs,  cheesecake or pudding for dessert I personally love it and so do all my friends that I've brought here"}
{"text":"This place is fun and has and interesting atmosphere. I dig the conveyor belt and the minimal interaction from employees kind of like the automat that used to be in NYC on St.Marks before they turned it into a pinkberry or something. What is wrong with it is the sushi sucked in my opinion. Their tuna sushi which went around the belt several times was grey. That is not appealing to me at all. And I thought their pitchers that they served your drink in looked like someone's water bottle they pulled out of their lunchbox. Did not dig that. Also the staff don't help you so you're left kinda lost to figure stuff out on your own. Teharu you get 2 stars. Fun atmosphere though.Best thing there was the baked clams."}
{"text":"I have been here 2 times and the food has been good and cheap both times. I like that you can pick different things and that it is a good amount of food. I am pretty new to eating sushi so the quality here seems to be good.  The wait can be pretty long so go before you are really hungry."}
{"text":"Lunch at Teharu was really good, great assortments of sushi and other items to please the non sushi eaters. fast service and good customer service."}
{"text":"\"This has become our go to place for sushi. It's not AYCE but it's actually better for us. You can't beat $30 for all the sushi 2 people cared to eat including drinks. I've had better sushi but have never had better sushi for the price. If you want a good, everyday type sushi stop, this is it.\""}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place on Valentine's Day! It was busy but it wasn't too long of a wait.  I should start out by saying that it's great for families or people trying out sushi for the first time! If you've never done rotating sushi, you'll find yourself seated at a table or the bar by the conveyor belt. As soon as you're seated you can pick off of the belt! Plates all range from 1$ to 3$. The sushi comes in small quantities, and so it won't get completely wasted if you don't like it. You can also get bottled drinks, like Ramune, which are always fun with sushi. If you don't find anything on the belt that catches your eye, you can still order off of the menu.  To me, the sushi isn't the best, but it's still good. It's a great cheap option, especially when you need a sushi fix. There's also edamame and gyoza which usually come around the belt (take it when you see it if you want it... both go pretty fast!)  If you want a fun new dessert, try the mochi ice cream! The strawberry and mango are delicious. They bring you two of them, so if you want to try two different flavors they'll let you.   Overall good experience, good sushi. Good place to try new things. :)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend treated me to lunch today. This was my first visit to a conveyor belt sushi restaurant and, although I have always been somewhat skeptical, I must say that I am now a fan. The best thing about this place, in our opinion, is the price. Yes, this is sushi for the masses.  However, everything my girlfriend (who is a regular and loyal patron) and I ordered was good. Considering that we selected a total of ten items, including Shaggy Dog, Hawaiian Roll, Baked California Roll, Caterpillar Roll, and Salmon Lover's Roll, our check was just a little more than $20 for the two of us. Great lunch spot for sushi. We will definitely be returning.  Photo design by Billie Z."}
{"text":"After a couple more visits, I deem this place the Walmart of sushi. The past few times I have gone it takes FOREVER to get a seat. Then it takes a bit to get your drink and its a bother to ask for a refill. When you want your check - that takes FOREVER too. You would think they would be on top of that and try to get people in and out faster. The sushi is just okay and I now would rather spend a little more for great customer service and better quality sushi. If you do decide to go, take a peek at the floor surrounding the sushi making station. Disgusting! It looks like what you would find underneath a refrigerator."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant! It's so convenient coz we basically can grab whatever food we want to eat from the conveyor belt. And because the plates are color coded with the price, we know how much we're paying after!  And of course, the main reason we keep coming back is, the food is really GOOD! The service? It's as equally good as the food they serve!"}
{"text":"Not much to write. They are awesome and reasonably prices. We go there a lot and its always good!"}
{"text":"Great casual place.  Always good food with a good selection and wait staff.    Good value for your money."}
{"text":"I'm sorry if some people don't love this type of sushi place...but for me its awesome...very affordable and not lacking on the quality! Great Sushi...keep it up!  I highly recommend trying it out...you can't ask for anything better when you sit down and start grub time right away:)"}
{"text":"Good selection and the most reasonable prices in town for conveyor belt sushi! Love how fast we can get in, grab a quick bite and head out!"}
{"text":"A friend and I came for a quick lunch at around 12:45 pm. The place was pretty dead, just a couple other people were eating.  My first impression of the place, it's nothing fancy. The waitress was nice but not very attentive... she brought us one sauce dish at first. Then later, when we were done eating, she brought another one! No big deal.  So, about the food. The rolls were all sooo warm. I stopped with a spicy tuna roll because it tasted really off to me. I had one piece and decided it's not worth the risk to finish it. I also picked up a rainbow roll (minus the tuna), a Las Vegas roll and I tried the crab roll from my friend's plate.  The plus side. The food is DIRT CHEAP!! Prices range from $1.00 plates to $2.00 plates! I did enjoy the Las Vegas roll. You can also order from the menu which is what I'll do if I give this place another go.  I was hoping this would be a go-to place for my cheap sushi fix, but the warm fish is hard for me to overlook."}
{"text":"I did not have a chance to eat here, but I will not ever come back. I showed up for lunch today with two of my co-workers and they have a sign on the hostess stand stating \"Please wait to be seated.\" The restaurant had empty seats all over, but none of the tables were bussed. We waited for about five minutes as the girl who worked there walked by us three times without saying a word, and the sushi chef stared at us awkwardly and said nothing. We decided to seat ourselves and we waited a couple more minutes and did not get greeted at all. We got up and left! We also won't be back. All they had to do was say we'll be right with you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came in at 745 and order bunch of sushi (21$) to go and I waited like fucking 30 mins while there are only few ppl in the restaurant!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for one of our first few dates and we were real impressed. After a year or so, it kinda has been hit or miss when we come. The major sushi rolls we enjoy are usually never on the belt and we have to ask for it a few times before we get it. The staff doesn't seem to enjoy their work. They never ever come back to ask if we want more water or if we're doing OK. We still come cause we love sushi and it's a good price, but they're slacking."}
{"text":"An ok place for Sushi. Not enough seating and not much of selection on the sushi belt. Taste is decent and the service was good but way too cramped around the bar!!"}
{"text":"The spicy tuna made me sick. Some of the revolving food is clearly old. I would recommend ordering fresh rolls. Overall, not really worth it."}
{"text":"Went here with one of my girlfriends after a photoshoot, was my first time here and I was pretty dang happy! Quality ranges from meh to really good, just depending on time and stuff. I'd assume don't go near closing- they'll stop making fresh stuff to put on the belt. Common sense, yo.  The service was great, everyone was super nice, and even though we had to wait for a table it wasn't long or obnoxious.  If I'm in the area again, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My son wanted to take me here, I like sushi so I was game. It was good.  Revolving sushi, means no wait when u are seated... start eating! I worried about the sushi not kept cold enough. Everything was good. Probably not interested in trying again even though affordable."}
{"text":"A veteran of conveyer belt sushi restaurants, I was excited one had opened up here in Phoenix. However, I have to agree with the comment that they are \"as fine as McDonald's\" because the sushi I had there wasn't very tasty.   However, their greatest faux pas is not mediocre sushi; it's location. If they were up by ASU, there's no question they would be busier. But they are way out in a strip mall in SW Tempe, and I was one of only two customers at the dinner hour. I hope they get more of a lunch crowd.  If I were them, I'd 1) change location. They're open til 11pm, so they should be around a college or more populated area. 2) put sensor strips on the bottom of the plates so they can tell how many times the sushi has gone around. The same plates kept going by the whole time I was there, and who knows how long they had been on the belt. 3) The unagi I had was pretty good, but the tamago was tasteless. Figure out which items are tasty and which could be improved. Then improve them."}
{"text":"This is worlds better than the Teharu in Tempe. Carbs for me are an occasional treat, but if they weren't I would live here. My tastes tend to favor the $1 plates, and lucky that is because I can leave here with a happy belly for $5.  I've seen a lot of kids eating here, and I think that's great. It's far healthier than the Mickey D's I grew up on. It's also wonderfully convenient because there's no waiting to order. As soon as you sit down, the food is gliding by right in front of you, beckoning.  A piece of advice - get there at the start of the lunch or dinner hour, as the food will not have gone around as many times on the belt and will be colder and fresher. I should disclose I don't eat fish, so I don't have to worry about warm raw fish. But the veggie rolls are delish. And they have gluten-free soy sauce upon request."}
{"text":"The staff is very very courteous. Yes, some speak English as a second language. Good thing! Must mean they know something about Japanese and Japanese food. Price is right. Sushi is at room temperature."}
{"text":"I've never eaten in a sushi place on a conveyer belt. :) It was very cool! Watching the sushi and selecting was heaps of fun! There was a lot of sushi selections and even desserts like cream puffs! It was also cute how they even had drinks on plates like Ramune. They have a lot of sushi that I haven't tried even as random as \"asparagus roll\". The fish slices (on nigiri) were decent! I'm glad that the sushi was labeled or else I would have eaten jalapeno on tempura batter haha! The price per plate was reasonable!"}
{"text":"Decent selection of revolving sushi. Service is slow and not very friendly, maybe even disorganized. It's 1pm and they have the bar closed down, only the tables are open, which for some is awkward to reach across for your selection of fishy bites of yum. For me, the rolls are too big, not rolled tight and clean, making 2 bites instead of 1. And not all of the ingredients are making it throughout the whole roll . But, for cheap revolving sushi, it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Nothing happens when you yelp this place and it's unfortunate. I won't suggest it to anyone to eat here. You wait forever and they close tables at peak hours. They take forever to clear tables. I seriously considered giving this a 1 star review, but the sushi isn't bad so they get 2. So if you want to wait forever and get aggravated before you eat, enjoy!"}
{"text":"If i could give this place negative stars I would.  We have been going to Taharu for years at the Tempe location and never had issues. Apperantly this must be the red headed step child because the service is bad... Walked in when it was dead at 2 pm it's 314 pm and still don't have my order that I placed. I flagged down the server to have her tell me she doesn't know what happened to my order but if I want I can pull from the bar I could do so. The whole point of using the order form was because what I wanted wasn't on the bar.  No refills on drinks even after asking,  Horrible service. If I come back it will be the Tempe location since they don't leave you hanging for an hour and then loose your order."}
{"text":"Used to eat here all the time until I got food poisoning really bad and was out for 3 days. Never eating here again."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place.  Seriously eat here at least once a week! The Haru Poppers are the best thing ever!!! While the servers are nice and helpful... sometimes the service is SLOW  (drink refills) and if you put in a special order it may get forgotten or put in a while after you've ordered it.  But... we still eat here tons despite all that! Definitely come here if you're looking for a great rotating sushi place!"}
{"text":"For some quick sushi, this is the place to be! Their rolls are quirky and delicious. Getting food here is simple and fast, as you choose your dish from the rotating conveyer belt. However, getting the check or ordering something off the belt can take some time to flag someone down."}
{"text":"YUM! I could sit here all day long a shovel some sushi into my stomach. The rolls are pretty great, typical rolls not that many specials. Not the place to go for anything but cooked sushi really, not that many raw options. Would give one more star but the service can be pretty lacking at times, like when you are in need of a drink refill or want to put in a specific order."}
{"text":"The sushi is descent, the hot green tea is excellent, the price is right, and they have good service. I like to order a few things that are not available in the conveyor belt; the Uni was good 4 out of 5 times. I would like to say this is a great place for a quick bite since the sushi is ready when you arrive but the reality is that the place is always packed and there's usually a 30 minute wait for dinner if you are not alone. However, if you are by yourself, then you can usually be sat right away or with a minimum wait time."}
{"text":"It's not super fancy sushi, but it's good sushi. The people are friendly, it has a good variety, and you really can't beat a sushi place where you can go in, get 10 plates and spend under 20 bucks. Sometimes you have to be a bit vocal to get a drink refill, but besides that this is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix."}
{"text":"On a BUDGET? Eat at Teharu!  Nooo I'm not advertising for them but if your in need for a quick fix of sushi, well then grab a seat at Teharu! Their sushi is cheap, in small portions, and well its CHEAP! Good for college kids on a tight budget. Service is ok and could be improved but...its CHEAP so its works out! Its not exactly a place to order your over the top sushi filled with tons of ingredients but it'll do.   Good atmosphere for all ages. Not really a place meant to impress the boss or something...unless their clueless of how sushi is delivered to you on a conveyor belt...hmmm on a second thought, maybe it will."}
{"text":"Conveyor belt sushi!  Average type sushi for rock bottom prices.  Most of the dishes we got were $1.50, but prices will range from $1 to $2.50.  If you get rolls, there are usually about 4 pieces on one plate.  Larger rolls such as the Las Vegas Roll (which is deep fried) will come as 3 pieces.  They have the usual suspects of sushi: salmon, maguro, yellowtail, bbq eel, as well as octopus, squid, and the uncommon conch (which was too rubbery and tasteless for me).  As well as sushi, you can find ramune soda, pudding cups, orange juice, and various desserts.  They had cream puffs and cheesecake for today's dessert.  Our total for 2 people with sodas was ~23 dollars, not bad for a sushi dinner!  P.S.  If you order soda ($1.75), it comes in a prepackaged plastic bottle so no unlimited refills, but it will give you ~2 drink cup's worth."}
{"text":"Couldn't possibly be any cheaper for sushi! It's good and you can start eating right away! No more having to wait for a server! My boyfriend and I both were stuffed for about $30! Usually we spend at least $100 on sushi dates! It's not the most fancy sushi or very best quality but I'm picky about the freshness of raw fish and this place has never worried me! It's super casual and you sit next to strangers but if tat doesn't bother you then definitely try this place out!!"}
{"text":"Loved the potato roll , the crispy onion roll, the Haru popper roll a must try. I just randomly came across this place and I was not disappointed one bit. Good sushi, great staff, enjoyed it thoroughly."}
{"text":"BAD customer service. Our server barely checked up on us and the other server had to come ask if we wanted refills. We placed two orders for sushi not on the conveyor belt and they forgot about it. We asked the other server if they had placed it already and she told us they don't serve Volcano Rolls on the weekdays so we sat there waiting again. Food was alright, not terrible, but then again you are paying for cheap sushi. The ginger also sits out on the table unrefrigerated.   I prefer Ahi Revolving Sushi bar better because they have complimentary soups, and they actually come and refill drinks and to check up on you and I think the sushi is better there as well.   Almost all their sushi plates here are $2 and it's basically any other seafood on top of a California Roll. There are other revolving sushi bars that offer way better sushi for that price or for $3.   Tbh, I don't recommend this place because there are  other sushi places that are better. But you can decide for yourself if you want to come."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place by far.   Fresh sushi from $1-$3, HUH?! Sushi-sans ready to make your favorite hand rolls, WHAT!!! And everything floating in front of you on a revolving conveyor belt, O-KAY!!! What more could you ask for!   No snobby people, no business attire, and no $100 tab for 2 people.  Every time my bf and I come here we never spend more than $30 and we're always full by the end of the meal.   Some of our favorites: Salmon skin hand roll, Haru hand roll with rice (two slices of smooth tuna, avocado and crab mix), squid salad, seaweed salad and baked mussels. MmmMMM! They also have a small menu for kitchen food, like bbq chicken and desert like tempura ice cream."}
{"text":"Always really nice and fun atmosphere. They have great service and great food!! The price is amazing and they are always accommodating.(:"}
{"text":"DO NOT eat here on Monday nights. They only open half their restaurant. Even though there's so many people waiting to be seated they will NOT open the other half.  For that you get 1 star. You are losing money by having that rule."}
{"text":"Really cool concept! EXTREMELY CHEAP FOOD! For the price of $1-$2 per plate you can't beat it! Ido wish the sushi was colder tho. And the service was unattentive & slow"}
{"text":"Ok, so their sushi isn't exactly Drop-dead-yummy sushi. HOWEVER, for the price, the sushi is pretty good! It's cheap, quick, and delicious. I've been here a few times with big and small groups and it works either way. Too big of a group might not work though. (It's a rotating sushi bar) so seating would be a little awkward in a big group.   You pick the sushi you want to eat off the belt and just grab it and eat it! The prices are based off of the color plates you have, which they total up at the end. Let's just say I myself ate 4 plates one time, and the bill was under $13.00!!! I think it was like 3 rolls of sushi and something else. Now try doing that at any other sushi place. NOT easy, right? :)  This is a great interactive place and wonderful with kids because they get to see and pick what they want to eat."}
{"text":"Love coming here with friends for sushi. Cheap and usually fast to grab some different kinds of sushi off the conveyer. The rainbow roll was my personal favorite. The service with the waiters is quite slow however. It takes a while to get their attention."}
{"text":"The only time we saw our server was when she brought our drinks.  drinks stayed empty throughout the entire visit.  After sitting for 20 minutes after finishing we eventually resorted to going up front to pay our bill.  We have a similar experience nearly every time we visit but keep coming back because of the concept.  This location has turned over 3 restaurants in the past five years.. if this place wants even a chance at sticking around they are going to have to retrain their staff.  I manage a large restaurant and if I were responsible for this establishment I would be frantically developing a development plan because the service staff desparetly need direction."}
{"text":"Good selection, great prices! I love that the smaller plate sizes let you choose a bunch of different options so you can really try everything that looks good without worrying about spending too much."}
{"text":"Big parties are a NO NO they do not let you sit at the bar if you have a party of 5. Oh and if you decide to complain that the wait time is too much, they will throw the drinks and chop sticks at you. Especially a asian old lady called Jay she will be extremely rude! Beware of Jay!!!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is super cute, but unfortunately that doesn't make up for the bad sushi.   I mean, a conveyor belt is super fun, but raw fish riding around the restaurant without any refrigeration is a scary notion.   I am not a fish person, so I stick to shrimp and krab/crab (yes, I know krab is pressed fish.. ) and didn't try any of the fish rolls, but everyone else at the table mentioned that their rolls were all fishy.  Fishy fish is a sign that it isn't very fresh.  A lot of people complained about the service...I didn't think it was particularly bad. You would get the same type of service at any other buffet-type restaurant.  It is cheap, but so is Taco Bell.   I wanted to like this place because my friend was so excited to go there for his birthday, but I really didn't."}
{"text":"This place has me at a meh! Its not the best and its not the worst! Best part is its cheap, if your looking for bang for your buck this is definitely the place, dont expect quality though! Its very cool to be able to eat sushi cheap and try a ton of different kinds of rolls, but when you have had good sushi its hard to go to this lower quality taste. Yes its awesome, the sushi is on a conveyor belt, tons of different rolls to choose from and you can actually see it and pick it up and try it. Yet the taste, just room temperature, bland and squishy. I do think this is a great way to start out trying sushi for the first time! It was frustrating that most of the signs were old/rubbed off so you couldn't see what they said to figure out if you wanted to try the roll or not, or remember it for the future at different places. The staff working this day didn't speak a lick of English, which can be super frustrating when you are just asking for a water and you cant explain that any different. They had pudding and cheese cake on the belt for dessert which I found funny, but I tried it and its basically a piece from a store bought cheese cake. Funny part, since no one spoke English I couldn't get a fork, also they were really bad at paying attention to customers who needed things. They kept disappearing, very bad customer service. so anyway, I had to eat my cheese cake with my fingers! Try eating cheese cake with chop sticks..... doesn't work, fingers thanks for the help! LOL! After almost finishing my piece of cheese cake she saw me eating with my hands so she brought over a fork! A little late, I was done shoveling it in my mouth haha. If you want cheap Saki Bombers and Sushi, come here for sure, good deals! Looking for a cheap date, this is your place. Still an overall meh with me! I like more quality in my food!"}
{"text":"I love sushi! This place is my go to. I don't typically sit down to eat my food for two reason. One the sushi goes around and around for a long time! One time I counted it going around 11 times! Second reason, if you order to go it's way better quality. It's specifically made for you. I order to go at least 3 times a week here. I only down around 12 or less every time I come. Very inexpensive. But if you come in to sit down they will ignore you for about 20 min lol. Sit your self down if you see open sitting ! I have before.  The sushi quality isn't amazing! But it's very very good for the price. Love love love it!"}
{"text":"Yep, I'm in love! Suck it, RA!! I love this place because you can choose sushi from a conveyor belt while you sit. You can also special order an entree as well. I also love how the plates are each $1.50 or $2.00 and the portions are small (3 pieces to a plate) so you're not stuck with 8 pieces when you order one roll. This way, you can sample a little bit of everything. I got 2 rolls, edemame, dumplings (forget the actual name) and my husband got 4 rolls and the total cost? $15! Hot damn, we WILL be back!!!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place out. My boyfriend wanted sushi and has been looking for a sushi spot with the conveyor belt just like the ones we have back home in Hawaii.    Going in it was really busy! Which I expected on a Friday night. I liked that the sushi on the conveyor had lids on them not like back home. The prices were hella cheap and I must say the portion size was a good deal for the price, comparison to genki sushi price and portion! That was a big plus for me. I liked the hawaiian roll! If you're an ahi fan you must get it! The rainbow roll is also Yums!  The only downfall which lacked my 5 star rating was the service:/ I didn't get everything that was on my list which they give you at the start to check mark what you want. Also all night they didn't refill our water. I had to share with my boyfriend! No one came to ask if we needed anything and I felt as if I needed a buzzer just to get the waiters attention! So glad we had our sake bombs to keep us occupied. I understand it was busy, but I think they need a better system or more workers to care for everyone's needs.   Overall I would still go back! The sevice just needs working on!"}

{"text":"Good sushi? Yes. Best I ever had? No, but the price makes up for it. Plus I love the conveyor belt. Not that original but I have only found one other place near me with it. Service is so-so but you basically serve yourself so its irrelevant. No plates over $2 and they have a little chart that lets you know what color is what price. I got a rainbow roll, gyoza (potstickers), shrimp tempura roll, edamame, and a cali roll for $9 inc tax. And the time I went with my bf I can't remember everything we got but we were both stuffed (and he eats a lot!) for under $20. Great place to go for quick, super cheap sushi. They also have a menu if you want to order anything not on the belt or if you don't want to sit at it. Definitely my new favorite!"}
{"text":"By far one of the most interesting sushi bars I've ever been to with a decent selection of sushi. Wait time is a little rough but overall a good dining experience for any time you are wanting sushi...."}
{"text":"I came with a group of 4 at around 11am on a Friday, it was a full house but luckily people were leaving so we got seated almost immediately. It took around five minutes for a server to approach the table and give us plates and water. Then another 10 minutes for her to grab our order sheet. About 30 minutes after the paper was taken for our order to come out even though it was all sushi and sashimi pieces and most of the restaurant had already emptied out. Obviously service could be improved significantly, we were kind of irritated by the wait time. The waiters were more concerned about bussing tables than taking our order. It was also hard to catch a servers attention for more water.   I'm giving this place a 3 because it is pretty cheap -plates are $1, $1.50, $2 and the sushi isn't too bad.   The revolving sushi bar is fun to look at and it's exciting when you do see something you like and grab it. However, most of the items on it are not desirable like a fried onion roll (what?) and a lot of imitation crab rolls, a lot of drinks, and peach cups. There's almost never sashimi or sushi pieces on it.   The paper menu is pretty extensive so most of what you get should be from there. The fish isn't the freshest but pretty good considering it's pretty cheap for such large cuts of fish. Each sushi piece and roll however had WAY too much rice, as if they want you to get full faster. The unagi (eel) was good, white tuna was pretty yummy, and salmon was delicious. The sweet shrimp was also surprisingly not bad. I wanted to try uni but they didn't have it that day. The rolls don't have descriptions on them, I blindly ordered a dragon roll which is basically an imitation crab roll with unagi on top.  Red snapper (white fish) was only $1, it's so cheap it's kind of scary! Haha, overall, a fun experience and pretty cheap. We ordered a lot and the total was only $80 including a 20% tip. Would have been 4/5 stars if the service wasn't so slow."}
{"text":"Super cheap and good way to try new sushi! We will definitely be back! The salmon nigiri, 2 pieces for $1 was a steal! Super buttery cut of salmon. And the Hawaiian roll is so good. I have a gluten intolerance and Teharu definitely give me lots of choices!"}
{"text":"We have been going to teharu for years when up in Phoenix.  The prices cannot be beat,  however the sushi rolls leave a lot to be desired.  A majority of the rolls seems to have a crab mixture which I am not a big fan of.  The service is ok.. When it's busy it's usually not long to get a table. If your looking for a easy in and our and well priced this is your spot."}
{"text":"Having to pick the food on a conveyor belt was a fun experience. Pricing was very clear and far from excessive (2$ max / plate) the staff was smiling and very quick to answer any of my needs would it be a spoon for desert or making me a pair of salmon sushis when there wasn't any on the belt. And more importantly, the food was very good and somewhat innovative. Would definitely recommend to a friend and go there again."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I won't be returning. The chefs clearly don't know how to properly cut sushi. We received a plate that tasted fishy. I ordered the same dish 3 times and it didn't come until we had already paid for our check and were ready to leave, not to mention the order was incorrect. Had anyone ever came to check on us or ask how we were doing I would have been able to address these issues but the staff was virtually nonexistent for our entire time there."}
{"text":"3.5  I had lunch here with a coworker on Wednesday and we arrived mid-lunch rush, so we patiently waited for 2 seats to open up at the sushi bar. I had a california roll, spicy crab and shrimp roll, and gyoza. Everything tasted good, and I was glad that they had labels and descriptions for all of the dishes. The service was good and the pricing was good for the quality you received. I'll definitely return"}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss on the sushi. But I still enjoy coming here.  It's a nice place good service friendly people."}
{"text":"Very different and affordable way to eat sushi. It had good taste. Love the drinks with the marbles."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! A great pick for a group who loves a variety on a budget. It's style is fantastic for my husband and I to get exactly what we want for half of what we pay at any 'ol sushi bar. We would recommend this place to anyone who will listen"}
{"text":"Fast, fun, delicious, cheap. Nuff said."}
{"text":"Ew you get what you paid for I guess. They have these plates that are colored so you're either paying 1.00-2.00 per plate of sushi but who knows how long it's been rotating around other tables before it gets picked up by someone. Some pieces were good most were horrible. I also ended up very sick afterwards and spent most of the night in the restroom. If you do go take a sweater they keep that place freezing. I ordered the last couple of plates from a menu which those where better tasting. Cheap yes good no but that is my opinion and the place was packed the whole time we were there so they get plenty of business."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Superstition location is better. Constant bird noise, kind of annoying. One of the ladies was super rude. Ehh I serve better raw meat at home!"}
{"text":"This place is cheap and, if you get to sit in front of the belt, it is fast enough for a quick lunch. Reading other's reviews and thinking I am eating raw food here, I guess I am a little concerned. But my hubby and I have been here about 4 times and we have not had any problem.  I think if I go back I would do a \"freshness\" test before I start gobbling down the food."}
{"text":"Keep in mind this is not high end sushi. However, for the price and the style, it is good. It is the conveyor belt style sushi. Grab what you want and pay by the plate. If you want something you don't see, they will make it for you."}
{"text":"I have been going to Teharu pretty often recently, not because the food is great and definitely not because the service is great.  It's all about the convince here.  You sit down and can start eating immediately and I love that, it's quick, easy, and cheap.  Blue plates are $2 Green plates are $1.50  I always prefer to come during peak times as that's when they are making the sushi and that's when the sushi is fresh.  For example, I just went at 8:30pm and it was slow.  This meant that I had to request certain rolls as they were not being made and my pot stickers were literally cold as they must have going around for a while.  I then had to wait 10 minutes to flag someone down so they can warm them up and all they do is simply re-fry them & as you can expect they are not the best once they have been fried twice.  Yes I'm going to continue to come here, yes the service is still going to be poor but that's not the point of this place.  It's cheap sushi fast, what else can you ask for.  Return factor- 100%"}
{"text":"Pretty solidly mediocre sushi. On a conveyor belt.  This was my first time eating revolving sushi. Pluses: no waiting for your food (in the beginning, anyway. After a while, you might be waiting for something you haven't tried yet to come around, or for a special request), sushi is REALLY inexpensive (we spent about half of what we'd typically spend on sushi). Minuses: average taste, sort of sad looking, not put together with very much care.   We enjoyed the Las Vegas roll the most and did not like the Hawaiian roll.   We were just passing through town and were hungry and the sushi counter at AJ's had already closed, so we were just glad to find something to eat. The place was slightly crowded and we had to wait for a seat at the bar (they didn't seem to be seating people at the tables) but we didn't wait long. Bigger parties had longer waits, and after we were seated it really filled up and people were lining the walls waiting for seats. We had to specifically request wasabi, because they forgot to bring us some. The sushi wasn't bad; it just wasn't excellent. I guess you never know how long it's been going around in circles.   We requested some eel, which was very sweet and very greasy and just sort of slapped on top of the rice. There just isn't a lot of attention to detail here.   There's something really unnatural about eating off a conveyor belt. I don't think the feeding process needs this kind of automation. The sign said \"fine dining\" but I'm afraid there's nothing fine about adding a labor-saving device more appropriate to a factory to ones meal."}
{"text":"Sushi is on a conveyor belt on hat is not refrigerated Service was poor. No one speaks English. We ask d to have sushi made fresh. Seemed to be a bother. Food was tasty though. Like a sushi buffet. Cheap and smaller portions. Except rolls are good value. Eeel Was good"}
{"text":"Really like 3 1/2 stars... My family loves sushi, and while the quality of the fish here was decent, the kids like the conveyor belt, and the price was right, it might be hard for me to come back.   My kids asked for tekka maki (plain tuna roll) as it did not come out on the belt. No one knew what it was! We are not Japanese and my kids are young, and they knew what it is! I asked the ladies behind the counter (one was making the sushi) if they spoke Japanese and they said no, they were Chinese. That's all good, but know the basics!   Anyway, my kids loved the speed of getting their fill and I liked the price. We will probably be back and go with the conveyor belt flow :)"}
{"text":"What? The sushi comes around on a conveyor belt? What?? The sushi averages $2 per plate??  Yeah, that's what I thought too.  But this is some good sushi.  It's fresh, and it's tasty, and even if you're on a budget, it beats McDonalds every day of the week and twice on Sunday. We once fed a whole table of six for about $60.  You can't beat that with a bat.    I can't say that it's the BEST I've ever had, but I go often, and I am never disappointed.  I really don't have anything bad to say about Teharu. I'm only giving it three stars instead of four because my damn cream puffs are always frozen."}
{"text":"I've been watching this new strip mall area develop as it's right off the 101 as I make my way to and from work every day. I was excited to see a new revolving sushi place was going in as the only other one I know is a bit further north in the Desert Ridge area. For some reason, they have since taken down the revolving sushi signage that they used to have so it just says Teharu now, which really doesn't say much at all.  We went on a weekday for lunch and was able to snag a spot at the bar right away. We were shown to our seats and the waitress asked us what we wanted to drink. After that, there really wasn't much communication. They didn't offer us a menu (they have one as the person who sat down next to us later requested one) or ask us if we were new or anything. Lucky for us, we knew what to do and started watching the sushi roll by. The selection isn't as large as the revolving sushi place up north (look at my past reviews if you want to know what it is) and there are only 3 price ranges: $1, $1.50, and $2. The rolls were delicious and a meal for $3.81, I really can't complain at all. You really can't beat that.   However, the service really was terrible. None of us got refills and we had to wait forever for someone to walk by to ask for the check.   If you're in to raw/authentic sushi, this isn't your place. But if you like rolls and want something super cheap, I would recommend trying this place out. Just don't expect spectacular service."}
{"text":"Went there with my hubby today. Fun and yummy. Liked that if what you wanted wasn't on the conveyer that you could order it direct at same price. Very affordable and can try a whole bunch of items on the cheap.  Weekday lunch rush is busy but can see why."}
{"text":"It was my first time in this place. The first thing that I asked was, did they have uni and they didn't have it. darn.  The foods had less option than the other place at Ray road.  The service was OK, I mean that day wasn't that busy or long line, but nobody refill my water or asked for it. I even put my glass at the edge of the table, wondering if they really see it but they didn't.  I might be go back for second opinion about this place."}
{"text":"I used to think that conveyor belt restaurants only existed in the future and in Bugs Bunny cartoons, but a recent trip to this tasty little sushi joint proved me wrong. The future is now and it is happening inside Teharu.  Tiny morsels of goodness dressed up attractively on colored plates stream pass you as soon as you sit down. The color of the plate determines the cost of the dish, but unless you are a giant squid, you probably won't exceed $10-$12 per person. And if you are a giant squid sitting at Teharu, then you probably have more pressing concerns anyway than the cost of a caterpillar roll, namely - where is the nearest body of salt water and could that adorable server fit into my beaky maw.  All squid-related concerns aside, this is a great little dinner spot. I came here with my girlfriend on a laid-back date night and was more than pleased with our experience. If you're in the mood for quality sushi on a budget then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"best revolving sushi bar I have ever been to! food was on point and service was on point aswell! The wait was long but only because of the time we went at, other than that they always had new and fresh sushi going around! You could literally taste the freshness! This was my second time coming here and I've been pleased both times! Would recommend this to both sushi lovers and beginners!"}
{"text":"Teharu is good for what you get. What you get is super cheap sushi at a super cheap price. This is a classic example of 'what you get is what you pay for.' The service was also just okay. The only cool thing is the conveyor belt, which is a novelty. Other that, there's not much to say about this place. Just come in, sit down and take sushi and eat. Try to enjoy it. I recommend coming here just once so you can see the conveyor belt. It is kind of cool because it's not common in Arizona."}
{"text":"Slow service and sub par sushi. It's nice because it's pretty cheap to be able to eat but you can get better sushi from the grocery store. Their seaweed salad is decent but other than that I wasn't that suprised"}
{"text":"There aren't many conveyor belt sushi places in the East Valley (but if you have a favorite, please message it to me because I'm looking to try more around here) but I really like coming to Teharu. The sushi quality is definitely not as good as say Shimogamo in Chandler or Sekai in Mesa, but there are a lot of other aspects of the restaurant that will allow you to forgive that. I don't really judge conveyor belt sushi places on the same on the same playing field as non-conveyor places because the experience is quite distinguished.  First great thing is that if it's a busy night (talking like Thurs-Sat past 6pm) and you're nearby and you call 30 or so minutes ahead of arriving, your name will be called just as you walk in the door (has worked for me twice, kinda strange actually). Otherwise, it's only about a 25-30 minute wait at its worst for walk-in sushi appointments.   Secondly, the food is cheeeeeap. Definition of a \"1 dollar sign\" restaurant. If you've been to conveyor belt sushi before, you'll know that they charge by the color of the plate(s) your chosen dish is served on (green is like a buck, red might be a buck fifty, don't remember offhand but no one dish from the conveyor is really over $3).  Third, with all the money you saved by not going to Ra, you will be able to buy more drinks!  Fourth, good service. They will leave you alone after they get you started and are pretty available if you need them. Well staffed restaurant.  Fifth... hm... shoulda stopped at fourth but 5 is a better, rounder number.  There are a couple of sushi places I want to hit in North Scottsdale first, but I will soon return to Teharu."}
{"text":"Great place and good food.  Cheap and good :) you have to try it! I go here all the time. Nice environment"}
{"text":"I'd never eaten sushi before, and this conveyer belt style was a great way to get introduced. I got to see everything available and ask questions about everything in real time rather than be force to decide from a menu. My more experianced sushi friends raved about it to."}
{"text":"Love this place!! I take everyone here and the prices are great. I definitely recommend the spicy mayo to dip everything in. This location is definitely my favorite and Vicky is the best!"}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi joint. You could come here for lunch and be in and out and fully satiated in 30 minutes. Sushi is good, not great, but you are getting what you pay for (and you will be shocked every time at how much food you get for so little) The seating is a little cramped and the interior could use a definite design overhaul (large square room, awkward decorations) and I shuld probably mention how strange the music selection is for a north scottsdale sushi spot (oh...cool, a Bieber club song....and now pitbull....*rolls eyes*) Also, it takes forever to get your bill sometimes so make sure you are flagging down your waitress. besides that, delish. Try it out, especially if you have never tried the conveyor belt model before."}
{"text":"Went to the Superstition location last night for the first time and loved it! It was the coolest thing! We decided to go back today for a late lunch 2:30-3:00pm and it was a totally different place.  The food was all old. The cold plates were room temperature, and the hot plates were cold. None of the items were being restocked, and it was the most popular items that were gone (edamame, Cali roll, pot stickers). We waited for the whole rotation to go by a couple times before asking when they would be refilling it, the waitress literally walked away with no answer. Nothing.  There was another woman asking if the desert items would be coming, deserts never came.  As we were leaving with disappointment the chef came out of the back where it looked as if he were sleeping.  I will return to this location for dinner only. Never again for lunch."}
{"text":"Its good for the price. No website and they never pick up the phone, thats annoying when you want to call ahead for takeout. I was in the restaurant waiting for my order, after I was unable to call, and calling from my cell phone-- the phone was ringing, yet not a single person would answer it.  I asked the manager when I paid for my food, \"why arent you answering the phone?\"  She just shrugged and didn't answer."}
{"text":"My first visit to a revolving sushi place, it was way cool.  The best thing is that you sit down and pick up what you want and start eating.    I was a little odd at first, but I soon picked it up in fact I really could have quite carried away with it.  everything I had was delicious!!  the cool thing is you might see something that you like come by but you have a little time to think it over because it will soon be back.  However i didn't understand the can of Vienna sausages or the snack pac puddings that were making their way around with everything else."}
{"text":"Skip this place. Cheap sushi, sure. But not very good at all. Just go to TA on happy hour and you get so much better quality for only a little bit more and so much more variety"}
{"text":"God I love this place!!! If you love sushi, getting your food quickly, only have $6 to your name and 30 minutes to spare welcome to your Mecca my friend. Well okay, let me clarify the speed: come during the week at night and at lunch on the weekends. I know that's probably obvious because that's how most restaurants are but worth making it clear. Everyone is different with what they consider quality sushi so let me break down what I look for: zero or very minimal \"fishy\" taste (check) more rolls that are raw rather than that fried crap (check) decent variety in rolls (check, though from my experience at night after 6pm offers the most variety) tightness of the roll or rather, does it fall apart easily? (Check, they do not). I suggest this place to anyone and everyone that mentions liking sushi; that's how much I love it! Try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends. It's my second conveyor belt driven sushi place I've been too and I like it! Their were some rolls I never had before and they are suprisingly affordable, like really afforable! They also have $4 Asahi beers! Now I'm in! The service here is pretty chill, and they all look great! They also place music that I like here, I don't know how many times I wanted to just fist pump while enjoying my drink and sushi!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy eating here... best sushi for your buck. I could prolly eat here 3 times a week and my kids absolutely love it. My favorite here are the teharu poppers I haven't found anywhere else that has good ones.....yum yum yum"}
{"text":"My original review was almost a year ago, and I think it's time for an update. It appears as though Haru has been listening to their customers, yay!!!  They now have a sign in sheet with a sign stating that you need to sign in when you show up in order to be seated. They are still crowded like usual, however it seems like they've hired a whole new wait staff. There's no longer just one or two people running around trying to keep up, they have enough people there now to make sure you're taken care of and you have refills etc... when you need them. Their sushi is still the same, that is to say good when fresh, if they're not busy I wouldn't go for anything that's supposed to be cooked e.g. gyoza or vegas rolls, they get kind of gross when cold. Overall, the experience here has improved and it doesn't take forever to get your check anymore. Much imporved Haru, I'm proud of you!!"}
{"text":"I just discovered this neighborhood gem and it is a fun new addition. The color coded plate system, affordable prices, grab and go conveyor system and sushi description sheet make this the perfect starter place for sushi newbies. I brought a raw-phobic sushi virgin and she loved it, because she was able to tell from the description card which selections were made with raw fish so she could stick to the veggie and cooked options.   It might not be the best sushi on the planet but it is deffinitely the best sushi deal! It is also a quick and affordable lunch option because you don't have to wait for  a server.  Oh, just a word of warning. If you accidentally grab a bowl of edamame beans and it slips out of your hand and spills all over the conveyor belt and gets stuck in the cracks of the track when it gets to the corner and the track jams and the plates start stacking up you should scoop them up like Lucy at a chocolate factory before the whole train derails and everyone notices. On the plus side you will enjoy the wide variety of dishes that pass by during the rest of your meal with edamame garnish on the side. I mean when is the last time you saw cream puffs with edamame?"}
{"text":"Best sushi for the price. I stuff my face for under $20 at least once a week. Staff is great and always polite. Could not recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"My family and I love Teharu. It is definitely one of our favorite places to eat. The fish always seems fresh and we can get in and out usually pretty quickly for a good price. I only gave them four stars because they could definitely use an extra server or two. It can be difficult to get someone's attention when you need something. They've gotten really busy so they should get more help."}
{"text":"You will see that I go here once and while because I have a friend that likes to stop by for a quick hit of sushi.  I've definitely had better.  I only touch the cooked stuff.  I don't eat raw anything circling and circling and circling around."}
{"text":"Yeah yeah--you could go here if you want.  V unique. V edible. Pick any sushi you want as it mopes along a conveyor belt. You know I t's good when there are never Asian people eating here. Or making the food. Just serving you. Water. But yeah, like, Asian inspired flavors. Green horseradish at every table. An atmosphere. I go here every other week. Stack them plates yo."}
{"text":"It's fast and convenient for a quick lunch. And it's pretty cheap!! The customer service however needs a little work. It's hard to get a hold of waiters/waitresses. But overall great for a quick sushi."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and it is always horrible customer service (i swear it gets worse every time). Last time some little punk kid with plugs yelled at me for being 5 minutes late for my reservation even though i called ahead of time to let them know.  However.. you end up just allowing it because the price is awesome and so is the sushi.  The wait staff is horrible.  They are horrible when you order drinks they are rude when they drop off your check... but ... I'm still coming back for the cheap sushi that so far hasn't made me violently sick."}
{"text":"The wait was a little long but food was good as always and the waitress was awesome with my 6 year old son. I don't mind the wait here because it's always a good experience, well priced, and near my home."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and service. I used to work as a sushi chef so I can get kind of picky.   You can taste how old the rice was, the rolls barely had filling, were bland, unseasoned, and messy.   I went out of my way for this restraunt and I was disappointed. The only thing okay about this place is the price, but you seriously get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This is my favorite revolving sushi bar and I've tried several different ones around the valley. The sushi is fresh, the place is always packed during lunch, and they have other options like their spicy ramen. They are always fast, clean, and friendly. The prices are so reasonable! The cream puffs are sooooo soo good."}
{"text":"Don't come around 2:00 because they'll stop making food since they closed at three. The food is good for the price, but the service is horrible. By 2:30 there was about 5 rolls left on the belt and when I asked if they could make me a roll they said \"were not making anything because we close at three\". 30 minutes before close and you can't make me one roll? Guess if you want to come and actually enjoy some sushi you should come in the middle of hours. Also, fruit flies we're flying all over the place and it was gross."}
{"text":"AWSOME PLACE!!!!!!! never seen something unique and different in how to eat sushi loved this place very cool place and price is not bad at all for sushi very affordable what else can i say about this place it's like a hidden gem in Chandler. staff is friendly and quick"}
{"text":"The food and price is good. The service is horrid. If you can deal with begging for a refill or to pay your bill it's ok. We've been several times but after tonight won't return. We sat for 10 minutes with empty glasses and never got a check. We added up the plates left some cash and left"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. The selection isn't as large as some other sushi restaurants (that's why I didn't put five stars), but you can't beat the price. My husband (a big eater) and I leave *stuffed* for around $25. That's by far the least expensive price we've found for a sushi dinner.  I agree with some of the reviews that said you don't know how long the sushi has been sitting on the conveyor belt. However, I'm guessing those people aren't aware that you can order the sushi you want - and it's made fresh for you. We either keep an eye out for the sushi that has been put out the most recently or ask the chef/waitress for the rolls we want. Just ask for a menu; it shows the different types of rolls you can order.   Tip: go with the \"Haru Sushi;\" it's my favorite!"}
{"text":"I love Teharu, I constantly compare this restaurant to the uber expensive sushi places and it not only holds its own but in many cases (like the Vegas roll) it blows places like RA out of the water. The best part is its 1/4 the price of other places. Word of caution is the lunch and dinner rushes are nuts so go at an odd time like 1:30"}
{"text":"It really sucks to say, but the service and quality have gone down so much since I started going here when they first opened. It takes at least 20 minutes to get an order placed, and when you do the servers won't come back unless you flag them down to get your check. They don't give out menus when you sit down and I feel like the common courtesy of putting the vegetarian rolls in a separate box should be obvious, or at least not squished against the rolls that have eel on top of them. On top of that, they increased their prices, so now my usual $22 is now $29. There are 2 other sushi places within a quarter mile of here, so time to start figuring out which one of them I will start going to."}
{"text":"Had horrible experience with Teharu. After getting a take out order on the Fourth of April and they got it wrong, we returned to have it corrected. They fixed the order and I thought all was good! Then I got a copy of my credit card statement and found they made a charge to my account on April 18th. I was never near the restaurant on that day or any other than the 4th of April. I called Teharu and they could not tell me anything because the owner was out of town and had all the receipts. I called my bank and stopped payment telling them the story. A month later Tegaru called me back and said there was no signature but someone swiped my credit card. I knew this could not be true as I had my card in my possession before I cancelled it due to fraud. This is extremely frustrating as I know when I order out and when I do not! They could not offer a real answer. I told them they just lost a good long term customer. They seemed not to care less!"}
{"text":"Best thing about Teharu, it's so inexpensive! The Hawaiian rolls are my favorite. The most expensive plate I've ever ordered was two dollars. It's pretty good for how ridiculously cheap it is. All of their spicy tuna/tuna rolls are really good. The only thing is that I usually order it to go because a lot of time they are really short staffed. When you order it to go it's usually ready pretty fast. Overall, pretty good sushi for a really good price."}
{"text":"The Sushi was great and super fresh!  The Shaggy Dog Roll had the yummiest sauce."}
{"text":"This place is not worth all the hype or the \"rave\" reviews. The quality of rice is cheap and was hard. About 80% of their rolls are sprinkled with sesame seeds n that's how quality sushi restaurants present or serve their rolls. The quality of fish was poor not fresh or buttery as one review had mentioned.  Each cut of fish was thin paper thin.  The most average or decent roll worth trying is the dragon then the rainbow.  You definitely get what you pay for.  I wanted try this place for the experience n boy was I wrong. Stay clear.  Find another place or go to California."}
{"text":"This place sells decent sushi for a good price. The conveyor belt adds both the kitschy aesthetics and the ability to see items and know their price (the color of the plate corresponds with the price) before grabbing them. Definitely a good value."}
{"text":"Fast food sushi -- I introduced this place to my sister and brother-in-law and they love it....interesting atmosphere with the revolving belt (great if your attention deficient), decent to good sushi, and downright cheap - I think they lowered their prices since Sarah G. reviewed (range is $1-2 a plate).  I agree not to expect fine-dining but will give you the sushi-fix at a great price.  Also with the revolving sushi - bar concept you get instant gratification (My advice is to wait until something looks really good before picking up - they have some really good stuff but also alot of mediocre sushi on the line. We also noticed that a lot of Japanese frequent the place - always a good sign."}
{"text":"Updating my review after having visited a few more times:  For what the place is, it's good.  It's a very cheap sushi restaurant where I can gorge myself for around $15 or less.  As long as it is busy, the food stays fresh.  Some of the concoctions are not very tasty, but perhaps someone other than myself would find it delicious.     I can't give it 5 stars since I've had not so good experiences there in the past AND they never give enough wasabi, but the place is cheap and fast, so 4 stars it is."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. I used to eat here when they first opened. I moved back after 4 years and it's gone downhill. Did they get new owners?   The variety of sushi on the conveyor belt was weak. I requested salmon and it was poorly cut and not fresh. I ordered hot food. I had to ask twice was it was. Orders take so long I canceled a hand roll.   The wait staff weren't happy and their was no section assignment. So when I needed to leave, I just kept waving my arm but my waiter was on the other side of the restaurant. Thankfully another waitress came over to help me."}
{"text":"Service is sub par. We were seated immediately since it was not a busy night, but then ignored for about 10-15 minutes. When I asked the waiter that we haven't gotten our drink order or wasabi she asked if someone sat us. I was a bit confused cause someone clearly told us what table to sit at. A side note, this was not the first time that this happened here. Can't they keep track of the people coming in? If the business is reading this they need to have a better system and fired out the girl who sat us down for not paying attention.  Aside from that, the girl who took our drinks and attended to us should be commended.  For sushi, don't expect high grade sushi or for those critical California peeps, don't expect the same quality. This place is good enough in AZ for a quick bite :)"}
{"text":"I loved this place! I got soo stuffed and I only spent $26 for me and my husband! I was looking forward to trying out many different sushi rolls, but there was only like 6 different kinds. And the ones that they did have,were common ones. Also it's limited seating, so if it's packed be prepared to wait a little, but the wait isn't bad! Like 15-20mins at most."}
{"text":"ordered sushi to this Mexican lady from a counter since I didn't get a paper to order. 15 mins later I still didnt get my order. so I ordered to the Korean waitress then she told the same lady, 20 mins later still didn't get my order. This never happened before and I am very disappointed. Sushi is good but I would not recommend to eat in if you don't wanna waste your time."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I do my best to come here at the very least once a week. If you're timing is right and you have a group of 4 or less, you can usually get a great spot. I've had a lot of very good, high quality sushi from all over the country and have no problem coming here anytime to grab dinner and be satisfied.  The vibe, the atmosphere is fantastic. Typically very friendly when you come in the front door. Very typical, and welcome greetings from the entire staff when you enter. The food as mentioned is very good and especially when you start to consider the prices. The cost (determined by color of plates floating by) are very low for the food you are getting.  I couldn't be happier with this place, the staff and the service. Anytime I have visitors here from LA, Texas, I make sure to take them and they are always blown away.. and frankly jealous I get to live merely minutes from here!  If you're coming with a larger group, keep a heads up that you won't see immediate seating since this place is made mostly for smaller parties of 4 or so."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great prices. The food is decent especially for how inexpensive it is. Mind your plates though as they do add up if you aren't careful. My only complaint is the staff are occasionally too busy to check on you after you've gotten settled in. Overall a great time, come here very frequently!"}
{"text":"I use to come here at least once every week. (I didn't check in all the time.) My main sushi dish is the rainbow roll with spicy tuna inside. They charge $1 extra for it, but whatever that's fine. Now the only thing that really annoys me is the lack of communication and bad customer service with the employee's. One day I'm told I have to pay extra for sauces and the next day I'm told no that's not policy it was a battle every time I was in there. It seems like it depended on which employee would ring me up, it was super annoying. There is an employee I can't remember her name such a shame because she was such a sweetheart every time I ordered my food from her I never had a problem. It's hard to rate this place but I would say customer service 2 stars with the exception of the young lady she deserves 5 stars. And food rating I would say 5 stars what can I say the rainbow roll with spicy tuna is my weakness lol. This place also is great if your trying sushi for the first time it has different levels of sushi plates. For example you can start with just a white plate those are cheaper and aren't that crazy with raw fish or sauces the plates are more on the plain side, kind of like an introduction to sushi. Btw the plates are in different colors which it's a very nice system so your aware of the pricing. Well I can go on and on about this place, until now in total I will be giving 3 starts hopefully customer service can improve and the other employees learn from the young lady. P.S she's more on the younger side, has black glasses and ponytail most of the time."}
{"text":"Love it, love it!! :) before entering this new location in Scottsdale, I have to admit I was pretty excited because I've been to their location in Tempe on several occasions and really enjoyed myself with all the sushi I could eat and sake bombs with friends. I really like this place because they give you some pretty tasty sushi for a more than reasonable price. Favorite thing I ordered on this occasion was the \"I Love Salmon roll\", impressed by the quality of fish, yum! Also I should add it was $2 for four pieces. If you've never been to a conveyor belt style sushi restaurant, you should give this place a try :).   ...Oh one last thing, the staff was very warm and friendly. Thought it was nice that they all thank you for your business as you leave."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, the first few times is especially fun getting sushi off the conveyer belt. The sushi is cheap, fast and tasty, but nothing special. Most of the rolls are just sashimi on top of California rolls. It is a good place to go with a small group and sushi newbies since everyone can get what they want and try a lot of different sushi without breaking the bank. My favorite thing to get is the Salmon nigri, you get two good sized pieces for only $1. I wouldn't recommend the sashimi plate since you don't get as much as with the nigri.   Depending on what time you go there is sometimes a 15-20min wait."}
{"text":"It is my second time here, and the thing I've noticed consistently is the poor service. It's always difficult to grab the server for some reason, even when there were only three parties.   The price is okay, ranging from $1 to $2 per plate. Do NOT get the spicy ramen; it's just Shin Ramen with an egg and some scallions on top for garnish. It was such an overpriced ramen for the quality, and my sister and I felt ripped off. Not to mention that it took over 40 minutes for them to bring it to us after we ordered; over 40 minutes for a ramen that takes 5 minutes to make is pretty ridiculous, and I have had a lot of ramen in my lifetime.  The size of the rolls and nigiri are decent, but not the best quality. The quality is okay for a kaitan sushi place, I suppose.  Do not order the green tea unless you want a tea bag. I had expected some matcha tea and was disappointed to get a tea bag for the price.  The most disappointing thing about my experiences were the poor service. Second was the ridiculously priced instant ramen (which costs $1 to make at home, yet the price was $5~6). There are a number of decent sushi places in the area, including Osaka right next door. Unless I need a quick meal (if I'm lucky enough to get the server for my bill in time), I would prefer other sushi places. I've been to many better kaitan sushi places, in terms of both the service and the food quality, for a similar price. I was so excited to have Teharu open up nearby, but I am very disappointed with my experiences."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill fast. Service is crap, at best. I have had to get up to get my own drink refills, and if you order something it takes forever and comes out cold.  Started by signing in to a decently packed list, watched as they skipped over us and multiple other parties of 2 so they could seat 3 or more at a table, making the rest wait for the bar.  Fish quality is crap now too... Cuts are smaller and smaller and  no longer tastes fresh. It had been getting progressively worse over the last year... I would have given 4+ stars just a year ago.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I have found a new Teharu and I am in love again! I will never go back to the one on Ray but I will drive the extra 15 miles anytime for this location.  Plenty of everything, no loud obnoxious crowds and the staff actually pay attention. I got my tea refilled! That may sound like a dumb statement but it would take me getting up and getting my own at the other location.  KEEP IT UP!!!"}
{"text":"This place is really interesting to say the least. I would say if. Your in the mood for a variety of sushi at a reasonable price this place is great.   My visit was just ok on the other hand because I visited with a friend on a slower evening. They don't make the sushi fresh to order..  Instead you grab the plates that travel around the room on  a conveyor  belt.   Being the time I visited the sushi had a little time to sit and loose that fresh quality you expect.   The sushi was however reasonably priced and I imagine during peak hours it's amazing."}
{"text":"Not the greatest but it's very cheap.. if ur looking for a quick fix of sushi and cheap this is the place to come"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO to this place close to 3pm as it is the cut off time for lunch. They will be rude...they won't care to push you out to keep their schedule. I just came from there 5 minutes ago. The first thing 2 waitresses said to me: \" Are you aware we are closing at 3pm?\" no welcoming no nothing. I went there before 2:40pm and all food was already coming through the moving trail, which there was plenty of time for one single person to eat. Even though I was the only one there (plus another couple), service was not good. Thanks Teharu...here is your review! Thanks yelp."}
{"text":"I absolutely love seeing a restaurant get better over the years, so you can imagine my disappointment in seeing one of my old faves gradually decline in quality.  Teharu may have been my very first sushi experience in the Greater Phoenix Area and the revolving bar novelty had me hooked immediately. The solid sushi quality and constant mission to make a plate stack reach the high heavens kept me coming back all through high school as a cheaper alternative to places like Mido. I'm talking near weekly visits -- would not be surprised if you could catch my ugly mug multiple times in the pictures of satisfied customers plastered on the walls.  During my recent visit to Teharu, I was surprised to find it busy as ever especially after hearing about it kind of drop the ball over the last four years. The revolving resto hype and novelty is definitely still reeling people in. After a solidly long wait to be seated, we grabbed a few passing plates to find that the sushi was indeed on the decline, a few rungs shy of mediocre. Definitely lacking in freshness, which is concerning considering we saw the plates hit the belts not 30 seconds before we nabbed them. We each had maybe 3 plates max before calling it quits and opting for a drive thru burger elsewhere to hold us over.  Holding out hope for some inspired culinary comeback story, but til then will probably aim to hit up the spread of other sushi joints in the Valley."}
{"text":"I went here once with my girlfriend hoping for a good time and surah definitely made it one. She was so nice and sweet. She was always had our drinks refill and help us in everyday."}
{"text":"This place wins the trifecta of sushi:  It's good! It's cheap!  It's fast!  I know, those things combined normally lead to some quality time in the porcelain palace, but Teharu has figured out a way to make it work, and by golly it does.  It's not fancy, the cuts of sushi aren't huge, but it's all yummy and even if you place an order rather than wait for your desired roll to slide by on the conveyor belt, it's quick in getting to you.    One minus: getting/keeping the attention of the waitstaff can be a challenge, but the fact that your potential meal is wandering by you means that you normally only need them for drinks and to get/pay the check."}
{"text":"I really liked this place the first time i went here, however since then i have definitely chosen to drive the distance to the mesa location for a few reasons. One reason being that this place is kind of dirty. Another is that the sushi here is not nearly as good as the other location. They use way too much rice and the other day there was shell in the lobster roll i ate. It scratched my throat pretty bad. Not pleasant at all. Also the service at this location really sucks. They will walk by you and never refill water and you have to wait approximately 20 years to get your check... meh."}
{"text":"My first experience here i was a little disappointed in the service. But, since then, it has improved. The food here is so much better than the priest location that i actually go out of my way to drive the distance here even though i live right next to the priest location. The food is way better here and the restaurant appears to be cleaner. After the first experience the servers have been much more attentive and I have had a pleasant dining experience at this place. I would recommend for cheap and yummy sushi!"}
{"text":"This place is such a great deal!  Sometimes there isn't a great variety, but if you don't see the dish that you want on the conveyor belt, you can request it from the sushi chefs.  They're really nice & accomodating.  They'll ask you how many plates you want too.  I usually only request one, and they put the rest of that roll on the conveyor belt.  My favorites include: -Hawaiian roll: spicy tuna topped w/ tuna -Spicy crab & shrimp roll -Haru sushi: two pieces of tuna wrapped around imitation crab & topped with a few slices of avocado -Haru popper (mispelled 'poper'): tempura-fried stuffed jalapenos -Crunchy California roll: I only eat this if it's topped w/ eel sauce (they should have a bottle of it there for you) -Vegas roll  The asparagus roll isn't good.  I've only tried it once, and refuse to try it again.  The rice was dry & so was the asparagus.  I would say the quality of the fish isn't as good/fresh as Mido Sushi or Kabuki, but hey, it's only $1-$2 a plate!  Being a petite little Asian girl, I usually eat about 6 plates on my own.  The wait is terrible during dinner hours, especially on a Friday night.  However, the good part about this place (other than price) is that once you get table, you can immediately grab plates off of the conveyor belt!  I always end up grabbing at least two plates before actually sitting down & getting utensils from the waiter. :)"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch the other day and I liked it.  I didnt think the food was as zippy and flavorful as it could've been, but it all seemed perfectly fresh.    (And yeah, in case you wondered, my yardstick for a freshnes assesment on a sushi joint is if I had to spend that night curled up in the fetal position on my bathroom floor, white as sheet and drained of all color, weakly clutching a wastebasket and praying for the sweet, blessed release of death.  And the good news is that DEFINITELY didn't happen.)  The food was cheap and I really appreciated that part of it as it's getting harder and harder to afford work lunches that consist of something more than a PB&J at my desk.  I think the most expensive item on the rotating sushi belt was about $3 a plate.    The service was friendly and prompt and I have no complaints there.  The only suggestion I'd make is to make sure to have your doors unlocked on the second that you advertise that you are open for business.  I walked up and tried the door at almost 5 minutes past 11:00 and it was still locked and I had to stand there like a fool waiting for someone to come and unlock it and let me in for lunch.  Overall not a big issue, just a minor observation.  Anyway, this was a unique experience for a very small outlay of money, and for me that is a recipe for a return visit!  ;-)"}
{"text":"The only reason I don't give Teharu 5 stars is because the service is consistently terrible, but you don't go to conveyor belt sushi for an awesome customer service experience.  Bring cash to avoid one more irritation of dealing with the bill.  The food is good, the service sucks."}
{"text":"Teharu's best feature is its prices. The rolls are all different prices depending on the color of the plate/type of roll, but the conveyor belt style of serving the sushi allows you to see all the options as well as keep track of how much each plate costs. As far as the sushi goes, the house specialties are the best. I thought the California roll and Spider roll were average, but the Shaggy Dog and Baked Scallop rolls were phenomenal."}
{"text":"I started going to Teharu many years ago, and I can say that the quality in customer service has absolutely taken a turn for the worst. The conveyor belt and cheap sushi is the only thing they have going for them. The sushi IS cheap, so no, I don't ever expect much quality out of it, but it's fun to eat cheap and pick whatever you want. But the staff, I've just had too many irritating encounters. They won't come outside to call names on the list (if you're not inside attentively listening, too bad so sad they'll skip you), they don't ever properly seat you anymore, only loosely point in a vague direction, we've asked to put in an order and instead of asking us what we'd like, this waiter turned for the paper menu and handed it to us and left, tried to order miso soup and was told \"I'm not a waiter\", we've ordered sushi and actually waited over half an hour for it and it was not crazy busy. We've even tried to call in to order food and the same rude waiter said \"it's gonna be awhile\" and was put on hold without taking our order, so we hang up and just decide to order it at Teharu to go, and upon pulling into the parking lot, it's not even that busy. Obviously I do continue to go, these are all very separate occurrences, but I'm just overall disappointed in the staff. It seems like the ones that are actually friendly are very timid, but the rude ones will give you all kinds of attitude. I never feel welcomed when I come here, and I don't expect it anymore."}
{"text":"I love this place! The sushi is super cheap and the food quality is pretty good! I have always wanted to try a revolving sushi restaurant but I feared they were expensive. Not Teharu, almost every plate is under three dollars...the problem is controlling yourself from overeating because of the prices. I don't think i've ever had a bill larger than $10 for myself and thats pushing it. The staff is wonderful and if there is a wait they are happy to seat you as quickly as possible. If the roll that you want isn't on the conveyer belt, all you have to do is order it from the waiter or if you are seated at the bar ask the chef. I also love that they keep a bottle of unagi sauce on the table--I put that on everything!"}
{"text":"First visit and was plesantly surprised. I was apprehensive about the style of restaurant but it ended up being fun. You pick plates from a belt that travels all through the restaurant. Good variety of rolls, and most were tasty. I also liked that the rolls weren't overly stuffes with rice. Dinner for myself and my husband (we were very hungry!)with one soda and one water was $35 and change. Not bad!"}
{"text":"BEWARE OF THE FRAUDULENT PRACTICES OF THIS BUSINESS!!!!   I am absolutely FURIOUS!  After receiving TERRIBLE service (on a Friday night, nonetheless), which included my server not bringing items that I ordered when the conveyor belt was empty, my friend and I both decided not to tip him because of his terrible service and attitude in response to our requests. Today, my friend checked her online statement for her credit card and found that she had been overcharged $2. I go online to check my statement to find that I had also been overcharged $2. Checking with the 3 other friends who ate with us and decided to tip the server, we were the only 2 who were charged an extra $2 on top of our bill. Furious, I called Teharu, was told that the manager was unavailable and proceeded to begin explaining my situation and was asked if I left a tip. I explained that I hadn't because I had received terrible service. In my opinion, by not leaving a tip I am helping my server to realize that he did a terrible job and he will therefore reevaluate his service and perhaps improve upon it. Being that many people comment on their subpar service that they receive here, the servers must not be tipped very well. Is this the way that Teharu responds? By overcharging customers illegally? When I sign a Merchant's receipt, I am agreeing to pay the amount that I write...NOT any more than that. It's no wonder that their service does not improve...Teharu is illegally making customers tip their servers (I bet we are not the only ones that this has happened to) which causes the servers in turn to have no incentive to improve their customer service. What upset me even more was that the woman on the phone said that there is \"no proof\" that I had been overcharged unless I bring in my receipt and bank statement, in which case they would refund $2 to my account. Obviously, it's only $2 so I'm not going to go all the way there just to get it back...I'll probably spend more on gas doing that. What infuriates me however is that when I explained that what Teharu did was ILLEGAL and FRAUDULENT, the woman on the phone was absolutely unfazed and did not seem to care about her business' immoral practices. Furthermore, my friend is a very light eater and $2 was nearly 33.3% of her bill. Imagine that - terrible service and a 33.3% tip? This business is absolutely terrible...I refuse to support a business that cheats customers out of their money by means of illegal and fraudulent practices.   UPDATE: My friend spoke to the manager, who was apparently on break when I called earlier, and he said that he saw his worker on the phone with me and considered intervening (but didn't). The manager continued to claim that this was a \"mistake\" and that it happens \"often\". My friend said that he seemed concerned and wanted to help us by offering to refund us $2. However, we do not care about the money, but rather that this does not affect other people. Therefore, our concern is not about the fact that we were both overcharged, but rather that this business is not taking the necessary actions to ensure that their customers are satisfied and treated with honesty and respect. Being that the manager recognized that this is a problem that arises often, I do not understand why they are not taking this issue more seriously and investigating the source of this problem...if it happens so often, how is it an accident?! We expressed that we do not think that this is an accident in any way and that we will be contacting the police to investigate Teharu's fraudulent business activities. Furthermore, I have already submitted a complaint to the Better Business Bureau.  If you have eaten at Teharu and paid via credit card, I highly suggest that you check your bank statement to see if you were overcharged. If you were overcharged, I hope that you will either comment on this post, submit a complaint to the BBB, or call the police directly as I will be contacting them shortly. I do not feel that anyone should sit by and allow a business to conduct themselves in this manner - it is not only wrong, but ILLEGAL and I am determined to put an end to Teharu's fraudulent practices."}
{"text":"Cool idea, and cheap prices.   Service is really terrible. There are a couple ladies who don't speak except to tell you how much you owe. The sushi chefs in the middle of the room don't look happy to be there. They ask you to wait to be seated but will leave you waiting for a long time when it's not even busy. They just literally don't notice you walk in.   We've had to just seat ourselves after a few minutes of just standing around being stared at.   The food is not really fresh. There are only a handful of dishes worth eating and the cheesecake is pretty good to. All the fried dishes are cold and the salads are sad and wilted.   I don't like that they hover over you to count your plates and organize the dirty dishes while you just sit there and awkwardly wait. But I guess what's the only way to do it.   If you want cheap sushi, and no interaction with the staff, come here."}
{"text":"Service to get seated at the conveyor was a little slow. Took about 10 minutes.  Sushi is good. But they had nothing with salmon on it. I live for salmon nigiri and sashimi so that was a bit disappointing.  However very affordable and overall a good place"}
{"text":"Decent sushi but fun with it rotating on a conveyor belt! Took and friend and we had a blast!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. I love being able to sit down and grab a plate off of the conveyor. The prices are excellent.    But, the little signs that go around with the names of food are dirty!  I have brought this up to the waiters in the past. Please replace them and clean them regularly!"}
{"text":"The sushi is ok, but I'm vegetarian and I always have to put in a special order, which takes forever.  Only reason for going there is it is inexpensive.  Service is HORRIBLE- you won't get drink refills and even have to ask for your check when you've been waiting forever as it is. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great sushi and you can't get a better price.  I work just a few blocks from Teharu and I eat here often.  The staff is always friendly and the sushi is always good.  For the same price you would pay at subway you can get a full sushi meal here.   I have also ordered to go on a number of occasions and have had no problems. Another plus, for me at least, they are family friendly.  I bring my 3 and 4 year old here at least once a week.  These kids eat at least 10 pieces of salmon each; it's their favorite food.  That would cost me $30-40 dollars anywhere Else, at Teharu it's $10-15 dollars.   The sushi is simple here, they don't have a bunch of exotic rolls if that is your thing.  They keep it cold inside, which I love but my girlfriend bring her sweater with her.   One last piece of advice, if you want anything hot (I suggest the poppers and green muscles) order it fresh from the chiefs or you server. For the price and quality Teharu rocks!"}
{"text":"I have explored revolving sushi restaurants in the past and love them. I was more than excited to try this restaurant as it appears so clean, and high quality with a decent price. Little to my surprise that this was the worst sushi restaurant I have eaten at. The sushi was not only small portions, but low quality. The sushi wasn't even cool, and there were few options to even choose from. The customer service was horrible as well. We only received one drink and never received a check up on how we were until we were already waiting 15 minutes for our check. $19 for a sushi date is a deal, I get that, but I prefer quality over cheaper price. Go to Kiku revolving sushi instead! *not affiliated with any restaurants*"}
{"text":"Great sushi for the price, friendly staff that remembers you and always makes you feel at home."}
{"text":"THANK YOU, YELPSTERS, for giving us the \"courage\" to branch out! We are having sooo much fun trying independent places instead of big chains; we are discovering a new world of great places right here within a few miles of us...  Based on what others say, I think we made a good decision in going when Teharu is busy, a Friday night. 2 of us waited about 15-20 mins for seats, which was fine. Because they were so busy, all of the sushi we had off the belt was fresh & delicious, lots of variety. It's not super high-end gourmet sushi, but we didn't expect that from a volume revolving place. A nearby diner ordered special custom items & said he's happy every time & that the staff is wonderful about special requests. He also says the variety is constant, regardless of traffic flow.  We tried a bunch of different things. We like the belt, as we branch out from menus; \"What the heck? It's $1.50/$2, let's try one!\" Although of course personal preference plays into it, all were really good in flavor & quality. I had plenty & my teen stuffed himself (that means a lot of plates), plus a soda & a $4 big asian beer, all totaled about $24. WOW."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  I mean, I really really like it.  I can eat a bunch of delicious sushi and get completely full and drink a coke and spend less than $15.  The atmosphere is comfortable, the lighting is cozy and the service is good.  The only problem I have is that they're so good at what they do that every time I go I have to wait to be seated.  So maybe they could expand and somehow get more seats.  That's just my opinion.  KU"}
{"text":"the rolls here can be basic but sometimes they surprise you with a cool one! remember you can also ask them to make special ones. its a very cool experience to have sushi go past you on a conveyor belt  and being able to grab whatever you want. the staff is great about checking on you and making sure your drink is full. its cheap, delicious and yes safe. one of my favorites!!"}
{"text":"This place is cheap, and I'm talking Fred Mertz cheap.  In fact, while I'm in the ballpark of I Love Lucy, let's recall the chocolate factory episode where Ethel and Lucy are shoveling chocolates into their mouths.  That's basically what goes down when I walk through the door in this place.  \"Pick that plate up, I wanna try that!\"  Even if I don't like it, I'm out what, $1.50?  I've lost more trying to get the mini Rubik's Cube key chain out of the 50 cent machine at the grocery store, and I've yet to leave the grocery store with the victory key chain.  Teharu is a bit uncomfortable at first, especially when you see that the conveyor goes behind a wall where who-knows-what happens, but can you really justify that discomfort whilst stuffing your face with raw fish?  Sushi lovers have all had bad sushi and it's really never as bad as you imagined it, so what's a sneeze or two on a roll (if that's the case)?  Honestly, you can't beat the prices for the quality of the food here.  No, we're not talking 5 star sushi, but definitely a good place to satisfy a sushi craving when your pockets are light.    It's also a decent place for a first date since the atmosphere refuses any awkward silences.  You're guaranteed to either be seated next  to the chick posting and filtering every roll on Instagram (that's me), or the old man asking his grandchildren what the hell the orange stuff is on top of the food and how can they eat that Asian hot sauce.   Just don't evoke your inner rudeness and reach across your neighbors... it's happened.  I've never had a bad experience here or spent more than $20 eating more sushi here than any human should be allowed to consume at any given time.  Sure, sometimes you get a roll with a texture that is the equivalent of blow-out-tire-debris on the highway, but again, we're talking color-coded plates to mark prices that don't exceed $5... for sushi.  And sometimes for canned fruit cocktail, which most likely the old man will be eating after he realizes what the orange stuff is.  A coffin is the only thing that could prevent my patronage here, especially after my bills and rent are paid but my stomach says \"gimme something fancier than Kraft\".  Decent sushi for a decent price."}
{"text":"Hello to all my fellow Az foodies!  Today I would like to tell you why I think if you are looking to enjoy some sushi and you think about trying Teharu in Tempe you should get back in your auto and drive over to your local grocery store and buy it there!  It has to be better than what you will experience here.  My friend has been RAVING about Teharu in North Scottsdale.  She tried it a few months back and has been a frequent customer since.  She came out to Tempe to meet for some sushi and having heard so many great things about the Scottsdale location and that the owner of each location are brothers I was super excited to check it out.  We went at 2:30pm, the place was pretty empty, yet that converyor belt was full of shushi... I am not sure who all that food was for but lets stop a moment and think about it... ok, so this conveyor belt runs the length of the dining room and there are maybe 10 people in the restaurant and you have to wonder just how long that food has been taking the \"conveyor ride\".  Absolutely NOTHING looked fresh and or appetizing....the freshiest looking food was the little cans of fruit that were \"just along for the ride\".  The signs indicating what the items were, were scarce.  They have maybe 4 or 5 of each item and each one had a different look and color....scary stuff!  The fried items sat under a plastic cover with the moisture dripping back into the food.   In theory conveyor belt sushi sounds good and although this may be common in Japan... this is Not Japan and it just doesnt work!  There were several items we had to take off the belt just to try and identify and we put it right back on...  I know you dont even want to consider this but.......... whos to stop someone from lifting the lids and touching the food as it goes by?  Like you, I would hope noone is inconsiderate enough to do something like that but really..... happens all the time!   Do you really want to chance it?  I tried  a couple items before I just couldnt do it anymore.  The ends of the fish were discoloring and turning up .  I wont bother to go into detail about any one item because there was not 1 item worth talking about.  My friend assured me that the Scottsdale location was nothing like Tempe and she said if she had tried Tempe location first she NEVER would have gone back or tried the other location.  It's the same for me... I made the mistake of trying Tempe location and I have absolutely no desire to try Scottsdale..  From what we were told 2 brothers each own one of the stores but they are run completely different..  So, heres a tip for the brother who owns Tempe location.....   LISTEN TO YOUR BROTHER!  DO WHAT HE DOES.... you are giving TEHARU a bad name!!  What would your mother think?  Oh yes, almost forgot to mention the employees... theres plenty of them... standing around ... but try to get some more water or wasabi!  HA!  I would honestly have to say in the MANY years I have been ejoying sushi...this was the WORST I have yet to experience.  One of the many reviews I read on Teharu wrapped it up to this... \"mediocre at best\"... I feel that was extremely generous!  Usually at this point I say... go, try it...see what you think but I gotta say....  Dont waste your time or money and dont insult your taste buds.  Spend a few bucks more and go somewhere ...anywhere else!  And so I say, enjoy each day as though it were your last and enjoy! Bon' Appetite"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a kaiten style sushi place in the valley and this one is good. They are busy, but the service is good. They are always happy to take orders if your roll of choice doesn't come around. I'm glad I live nearby."}
{"text":"I come here...A LOT. Such a great place to eat and there's always so much to choose from. Haven't had anything I haven't liked yet .... EXCEPT... the service Lmfao. This place is always super packed, which is a good thing for the business, but the service slacks because of it. The only time you see your waiter is when you sit down and she gives you your first drink. You have to chase a worker down to get your drink refills and your check. I still have to give it 5 stars though because the food is incredible and it's not that hard to chase down a waiter in a small place LOL"}
{"text":"We were in town visiting and thought we'd try it since it's a conveyor belt Sushi.  The Sushi was good, we are from the NW which has much better Sushi.  The service wasn't great. The waitress was fairly rude and seemed to act like we were bothering her with our requests."}
{"text":"The waiters in this place could learn a lot from manner lessons. They were rather rude and inattentive. Even with the language difference (they were Chinese I believe), they could at least be more attentive. Food selection was limited. There are other sushi restaurants in town, and this one has rather low standards, compared to others."}
{"text":"This place is good lots of room and tons of sushi options.. Price is grate aswell. Good place to go for a sushi fix."}
{"text":"I was not disappointed by my trip here, even after the stunning review from several of my friends.   The Good: Price-wise this was one of the best options I've ever seen for sushi. Items are served via conveyor belt (if you're sitting at the bar) and plates are color-coded to indicate price. With the plates ranging between $1-$2 each, this is definitely a great bang-for-your-buck restaurant. Between 4 diners we came away with PLENTY of sushi for $10/head.  The Bad: The selection of sushi is certainly far from the largest I've ever seen. Should you be wanting a wide sampling of the cuisine of Japan, this is no the place to go. None of the sushi was gourmet-level, but everything I had was delicious.  I'd highly recommend Teharu to anyone who wants to sample various sushi without comitting to $7-$10 per item. This is also quite the novel change of pace for sushi afficianados looking for a very different serving style."}
{"text":"Sushi is super fresh and they display a large variety of different things that go around the bar ON A GOOD DAY. It is delicious so I can't say anything bad about the food. As far as the service HORRIBLE!!! They need a larger staff.. two people is simply not enough to do the job as a host, server, and to clean up the tables all at once. You leave very few time to take care of your customers and their needs. Same thing as the sushi chefs, you order something so simple and it takes 15 minutes to get to you (literally two small pieces of sushi) this is my experience every time I go.  Could use some better desert options like other sushi stations have. BUT prices are dirt cheap I'm talking $14 to fill you up so your rolling out of there and can't complain to much."}
{"text":"The sushi is cheap.... The fact that it is on a conveyor belt ensures that you will eat quickly, which is a benefit compared to other sushi places. I've been probably about 5 times the last few months because I wanted a quick and cheap meal.   The rolls are decent, but def not hight quality by any means. However my friend had a super sensitive stomach and has fared well here each time :)  Service is okay... Sometimes they are really pushing you out so they can increase turnover."}
{"text":"Was just at this location for about five minutes when two cockroaches ran across the table. The lady who sat us down promptly squished both of them. We promptly asked for our check and got the hell out."}
{"text":"Terrible service took 20 minuets for them to ask if we needed anything it took all 3 employees to serve us and they took 25 minuets to give us the check after we were done eating they also charged us for soda when we got water! First time here don't think I ever wanna come again don't recommend it for anyone!"}
{"text":"We were very excited to try the new sushi restaurant with a conveyer belt near our home but were sadly disappointed. Very bland, dry, not good flavor in the sauces used. The sushi was dry. The cucumbers were dressed in plain vinegar not even rice vinegar. They will never make it if the food doesn't get better! We will continue to go to Ahi Revolving Sushi in Gilbert."}
{"text":"My conveyor belt sushi desire was definitely met.  We order several rolls, squid salad, and they were between one and three dollars.  We got out of there for less than thirty dollars.  No way....Yes way. Can they build one out here?  Pretty pls???"}
{"text":"Shitty customer service. Basic sushi and the laziest sushi chef I've ever witnessed (lady chef). We asked for an order of fresh Gyoza and the lady chef waved her hand at the belt indicating \"we have some on the belt\"...we politely asked for a new order (which we would've happily paid for of course) to which the waitress' reply was \"no one has touched the one on the belt - it's kinda fresh\"  I will not be coming here again. **Came here because it was my daughters choice**"}
{"text":"We came here to try some revolving sushi and teriyaki. It's my first revolving sushi place that we are trying out. Wait was 45mins for 4 on a Sunday dinner night for a table! Took me by surprise.  Service was not impressive. Our server sat us took our drink order. We were 3-4 sushi plates in before we even got our water and Siracha. Our server didn't come back to check on us until she gave us our check. I had to flag a different server down to get more water.  The sushi was good my husband loves the sashimi. You can see the chefs there cooking and making the sushi out in the open. There's also desert which involves cheese cake and cream puffs. My kid love the cream puffs.   Overall we would come back again, sushi is good and service yeah not impressive but you're just grabbing your own plate of sushi anyways."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love Teharu for its inexpensive and yummy sushi.  The plates are cheap and we love the conveyor belt style.  However,  lately the experience has gone down.  They keep half the restaurant closed so the wait is unnecessarily long.  The service isn't great,  we often spend most of the time without getting refills on our drinks. Long story short,  good,  simple cheap sushi.  May go elsewhere soon if they keep closing off half the restaurant though.  Editing after dinner: the conveyor was empty almost the entire time we were here.  We never received two of the rolls we ordered and never received refills on our drinks.  We have even waiting 15 minutes to get our check to leave. This may be our last visit. Teharu has truly gone downhill."}
{"text":"Sushi on a conveyor!! What more do you need to know?  Need to know more? Ok my son and I sat there for a half hour grabbing plates at random off the belt. I didn't bother checking prices. I like to live dangerously. The damage at the end, when we were both full of sushi? About 15 bucks.  Good stuff. Just go."}
{"text":"TeHaru Sushi is the place to go for hungry people, happy workers, and an overall great environment. Not many people go to a restaurant, get seated, and reach beside them and grab a plate. TeHaru Sushi is by far the uniquest sushi place I for one have ever seen. This place is definitely one of my top three favorite places. This place is the town hangout at peak lunch and around 7 at dinner time so be prepared to wait for about 20 minutes or so.    For all the starving people out there, TeHaru is the place to go. You walk in, sign your name on the piece of paper located right by the door and depending on how busy it is, the waiter or waitress will politely say your name and walk you to your seat. Once you are seated, they take your drink orders and your hunger will finally come to an end as soon as you see what you would like to have on the revolving belt. No more waiting 20 minutes for your food to be cooked, it is all made already. If there is something you would like to have, all you have to do is ask a cook, who is constantly making sushi right behind the revolver belt, and tell them your order. The will make any pieces you want.    TeHaru Sushi not only has the greatest food, but the happy employees make it all that much better. As soon as I walked in I was greeted with smiles from every employee. After writing my name down on the piece of paper, my family and I waited for about 10 minutes and were seated at our table. The waiter took down or drinks, cracked a few jokes that made us all laugh and we started eating. My brother did not see anything he wanted so he asked the cook for something specific, the cook without any questions made him a plate and was done with it in no longer than 5 minutes. The best part of this restaurant is that the plates are no more than two dollars but no less than one dollar. Me, personally, can only eat four plates and that is about 6 dollars depending on my plate colors. Blue is $1.50, White is $1.00, Black is $2.00, Yellow is $1.50, Tan is $1.00, and each plate always comes with 4 rolls.    The environment in Teharu Sushi is the best vibe someone can imagine. Even if the place is crawling with people some how the employees never fail to make you laugh, smile, and keep the people waiting for tables updated on how long the wait is. Even waiting for food is a good experience at Teharu Sushi. Everybody is kind there and I have never been treated so well at a place before. Teharu Sushi was such a great experience and I can not wait to go back and have my personally favorite, the California roll."}
{"text":"The food and service were ok.  The scenery was kind of bland.  I like the colored plates on a conveyer belt idea.  I didn't see any yellow plates though.  I recommend starting with the cheese cake since it's very filling."}
{"text":"This place is great, cheap, fast, easy, and yummy! As good as some of the most expensive places that I've gone to get sushi, and way cheaper. I just love the idea of the revolving sushi bar to begin with, because you get small portions of like 3-4 different rolls! My boyfriend and I can both eat for under $25."}
{"text":"Yummy, cheap, and clean! Love the revolving bar too! My husband and I end up going here almost every date night just because we love it so much. And we've tried other sushi places, they don't compare!"}
{"text":"This was such a great conveyor sushi place! The service is pretty fast and the price is definitely reasonable for the amount of sushi you can eat. Even with only three waiters and an almost full restaurant, the service doesn't lag and the food ordered off the menu comes in a good amount of time. The selection on the conveyor was good and the quality of the fish was pretty delicious. The udon was also a decent size for $5!"}
{"text":"It's a cool concept, conveyor belt sushi, but the service isn't as good as the sushi and the sushi is only mediocre at best. It's always crowded when I go, but they only seat people at the \"bar\" are where the conveyor belt is. Granted that's what most people are there for, but it seems there is a conveyor belt(s?) that go around the majority of the restaurant, but only the one around the bar is ever in use. Last time I was there,  someone in another party had to ask for a booth to be bussed after it sat there for 20 minutes untouched, my name got skipped on the list so 4 people that came in after us got seated before us. I said something to two different servers and was told \"oh sorry, I don't know how you were skipped, you'll be next\" before we actually got seated. The first time I went, I had a similar experience but thought it would be a fun place to take a friend. This second time proved that it's not worth going out of my way for"}
{"text":"I thought this place was awesome - the conveyer belt coming around with different types of sushi you can pick from was definitely cool.  We didn't have to wait around for the food and picked what we liked. I thought the sushi was pretty good,  and the price at $2 a plate was a great.  I recommended the place to a couple of friends of mine... and this is wear it got bad.  My friends told me they looked under the plates of sushi and almost all of em where sticky and gross.  The sushi and price were great, but they became apprehensive when they saw that the plates were dirty - especially at a sushi place where there's raw fish.  I'm not sure if they hand wash the plates or use a machine - but I looked like an idiot recommending this place because the cleanliness wasn't the best. I hope they read this review and make sure the dishes are clean."}
{"text":"This is a decent sushi place with a few good favorites. The nigiri selection is good with the usual go-to items such as albacore, white tuna and salmon. The sizzling salmon is really good along with the Hawaiian roll. Downside: there is a lot of crab stuffed items. If that's your gig, that's awesome. Personally, it's not for me.  Another con of coming here is the service. It's really slow so don't expect to get in and out. You have to ask for refills, order said favs if they aren't out and then proceed to grow gray hair as you wait for your requests to be filled.  Overall it's a good, cheap eat as long as you have time to kill."}
{"text":"They are normally OKAY, but this past time was kinda meh. The floor was sooooo sticky where they seated us; it was as if we were just stepping on gum. We have seen them push tables together for other customers, we requested to do that this time... Swift \"no\" okay then... Sat there for a good hour, no fresh sushi. Ordered a few things... It was :(."}
{"text":"Since the other \"conveyor belt sushi\" place in Chandler closed, this is the only kaiten sushi place in town, but don't fret, because I think it's at least worth a try, if only to satisfy your curiosity's sake. When you first walk in, there is no host stand, but only a notebook on which to write your name and the size of your party. This place gets jampacked at most times, so plan accordingly. Once you're seated, your eyes will be greeted by the variety of the items, and how cheap everything is. It's not first rate sushi by any means of the imagination, but it's certainly reasonable if you're in the mood to shove fistfuls of sushi in your mouth. Definitely worth a try in our book, and we should know, because we keep coming back and \"trying\" this place dozens of times already."}
{"text":"Just sharing a quick update. I still rate this place 4 stars because of how convenient and cheap it can be. After having a lot of sushi at a lot of different sushi joints I have definitely realized that the quality of fish here is well below average (if you want a littler higher quality go right across the street to Sakana or Yanagi in Gilbert). However I still find myself coming back here once in a while when I don't want to spend much money and need to cure a sushi craving fast.   I also learned that you can order directly from your \"server\" if they don't have what you want on the belt. So I'm annoying and will order like 4 orders of salmon nigiri and that makes me a happy lady! :)"}
{"text":"The quality of the food and the service has really gone down over the years. I've been coming here for years and choose not to come anymore. The way they make the nigiri is just done poorly. Not to mention, the freshness of their fish has become questionable. The last time I was there I went with my sister and we had salmon nigiri. The salmon was cut weird, almost like a triangle, and it was falling off the rice. Normally the salmon should have the stripes visible and it should sit comfortable on top of the rice. Anyways, it tasted pretty bad because the fish didn't taste fresh or tasted like salmon at all...and it was a bit chewy... We left right after that. Please note also if you like tuna, notice that it's a brownish red...not bright red. It means it's not fresh anymore so BE CAREFUL! Don't even get me started on the service...awful!!! The staff is not too nice. With this in mind, you have been warned!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. Price is great. Service tonight is ABYSMAL. Once we got drinks, it took 15 mins to have a server stop by for menu orders & a refill. Hopefully this is a fluke & not consistent. This is a fun place otherwise."}
{"text":"My wife loves this place everything is pretty good as long as its revolving, I wouldn't order any entrees as they take forever and are subpar, they go through employees like hotcakes, but good for a quick sushi fix"}
{"text":"The wait in this place is NOT worth it. They have half of the restaurant not operating and a long line of people waiting to be seated."}
{"text":"Do not come to this Teharu. They serve warm sushi and warm fish. I was excited to know that this one is closer to my house, but nope! Never again. Go to the one in Scottsdale, it's a thousand times better."}
{"text":"This place deserves a rating as low as  president #45 and that is looooooow. I'm an independent delivery driver that came here to pick up an order for a customer. As soon as I walked in a person told me in a rude manner to \"come here.\" I looked puzzled and said come here and she said yes come here as if she was talking to a child. I was highly bothered by this and had to fight my natural instinct to \"let her have it.\" Instead I kept my cool and just imagined telling her off. She was very rude and unprofessional throughout the entire interaction. I guess I shouldn't be surprised based on some of the reviews about the poor service other people have received. I wouldn't trust eating here based on the service I received. She needs an attitude adjustment and to be fired and never be in a position where she has to deal with the public. In case the manager or owner wants to know (I doubt it), this happened on 10/23/17 in the early evening."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a number of times,  and each time left with a different opinion of this restaurant. Believe me when I say consistency with regard to service is very inconsistent. The food though,  is generally good for the price. If you have not visited, you owe it to yourself to try it. The restaurant feel is very reminiscent of a Chinese buffet. It is not high end by any means, and servers are there simply to fetch your drinks. Upon sitting (hopefully next to the conveyor belt),  you can immediately enjoy Sushi by picking your desired plate off of the constantly moving conveyor. Choices range anywhere from Chinese soft drinks to fruit juices; from seaweed salad to edamame; from California rolls to jalapeños stuffed with crab meat and fried in tempura batter; from cheese cake to cream puffs. You get the point. Generally your choices are good for an average to low price sushi joint with plates ranging from $1.50 to $2. Food wise, this place is great. A party of two can have their fill for less than $30, and this is eating to fill you up.   Service is often where this place falls flat. Today, I stood at the booth waiting to be seated with clearly several spots open. We were only seated because I grabbed someone from their duty. He asked a woman,  who was standing there staring at us the entire time,  who suddenly gave the nod like a kingpin leader giving approval to whack a guy. Other experiences were great.  Seated quickly. Another bad experience had us waiting for our bill for close to 30 min.   When service is good, expect a great experience. Just don't expect the same treatment the next you come.   Food and price alone earn this place 4 stars. Inconsistency of service knocks it down two. Today's experience was unacceptable."}
{"text":"I have been to many revolving sushi places. The only redeeming quality of this restaurant are the cheap prices. Seriously thing place is cheap, and you get what you pay for ... maybe slightly less. You only really like this place if you have little experience with higher quality revolving sushi places. The rolls were often malformed or small. For example we found a few examples of Las Vegas rolls where they failed to make a complete roll. It was a C stuffed with stuff; and they expected it to hold together? Salmon Nigiri where the salmon was slightly warm. Some of the rolls were anemic compared to other revolving sushi places. If you thought this was the norm for these places you should visit Seksun Sushi or Sushi Station in Scottsdale. Sure you pay slightly more; but if good sushi is what you want then it's worth it.   The malformed, anemic, and not so fresh Sushi was only part of the story. The service was also terrible. I asked for a menu and was ignored. Yes she acknowledged a menu. It just never came. When it was time to leave it took 20 minutes to be recognized so we could ask for the bill and another 10 after she gave us the bill to pick up our card.   Yes we left a very low tip. This is what you get when you give shoddy service."}
{"text":"Sushi on a conveyor belt!  Was it the best sushi I ever had...maybe not.  Was it really fresh and good...yes!  Overall this place is a blast and we had a lot of fun.  The prices were quite reasonable the service was prompt and friendly.  We will surely go back."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and servers. Sushi was fresh and delicious. We ate here for lunch, not really packed. I just wish there was more variety. Overall I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I first found out about this place by word of mouth by a bank teller. A few months had gone by before I decided to stop by and check it out, I was so disappointed with myself for waiting so long. My first visit we came a little after the lunch rush, which seemed to be great timing. We sat down ordered or drinks, then went to town getting plates off the conveyer belt as they made their way past us! The pricing was very reasonable, restaurant was clean and staff was nice. The bill was under $30 for two of us which was quite a deal!"}
{"text":"My friends suggested we try this place for sushi. This is one of the worst sushi establishments I've ever been to. First the waitress sat us in the way back And she didn't even hand us a menu!! The only reason I knew was because the ppl beside us started ordering off menu items.  Second the sushi did not look fresh the mayo was turning a different color and not many choices. Also on the conveyor belt were weird items like juice boxes and random stuff that looked like they took stuff out of the fridge...the only pro is that their plates are cheap. But I rather pay for higher quality & a better experience"}
{"text":"Nope!Nope!Nope! Turn around and RUN in the other direction! If you eat sushi often you'll know what to expect. This place was DIRTY I mean gross! There's sauce splattered on the Windows, sticky floors and table. We went on a Sunday after church, there where about 10 diners and I was amazed to see a FULL conveyor belt of sushi. My first though was ok? Maybe they're expecting a rush? After 2 rolls I was disgusted! The fish looked like a fruit roll up, was NOT fresh at all. It was room temp which was disturbing and scared me to death. I really tried to give it a chance thinking maybe I'm being a sushi snob...? No, my husband was looking at me like to took him to an undergroubd sushi place in  Mexico because the standards we not there. I'm still in shock. The waitress was rude and did not want to be there. My 2 yr old son got teriyaki chicken that came with a size of sweet pickles that looked like they'd been sitting on that place from a previous customer who didn't want them either. YUCK! We paid and got out of there as fast as we could hoping we did not get sick. Don't do it man! Cheap but NOT worth it. I'll pay the extra and go to Sakana as I usually do. I should have known better!"}
{"text":"Best value sushi place in th valley. Good rolls and variety."}
{"text":"I was impressed by the selection of sushi. The conveyor belt is awesome! If you are not super into sushi, there are not many options for you. My younger brother and sister aren't big sushi eaters so all they had to eat was gyoza, edamame and cheesecake. My sister said that their cheesecake was some of the best she has ever had.  Definitely add up your plates on your own, so you know that you are not being overcharged. At the end of our meal, our waitress came over and counted the plates and then came back with our bill. You have to go up to the register to pay.  The service here is the type of service where they will leave you alone to eat and will help you when you ask for something.  This place was really fun to take my family to. There were five of us and we had a total of thirty-two plates and it came out to $51.28  Blue plates are $2 Green plates are $1.50 White plates are $3 Yellow plates are $1"}
{"text":"Well i got here in between lunch and happy hour so getting a seat wasn't that much of a hassle.  Like this place because the sushi is okay but prices are pretty reasonable.  The conveyor belt is always stocked with a good variety and also have other things besides sushi on the menu.   The service could use a little work.  Had  a couple of people with me and we must have had a lot of plates because my bill seemed a little more than what we had.  So make sure you count all your plates and make sure the ticket matches the food.  I think i paid 10 or 15 dollars more then i ate.  I usually keep track of how many plates and what color so usually know what my bill is.   I will visit when i'm in the area again but will keep track again."}
{"text":"It's interested concept but the sushi is not great at all. Most of them has crab mix. A lot of fried and I think they place coloring die on the fish. I will not go back here"}
{"text":"Here is the deal. I have raved about this place to everyone - forever. Great deals, fun atmosphere and being vegetarian I love the asparagus roll. The last 2 times I have gone there have been issues. Today was the final. I didn't see asparagus on the conveyer so I placed an order for the rolls. I waited 28 minutes. When I finally flagged someone down and asked about my rolls they said \"they are making them now\". Another 10 minutes and we finally ask for the check. When he is tallying up the plates I said \"hey I don't want to be charged for those rolls cause I have been waiting 30 minutes\" he shrugged. Someone in my party said \"what happened why did it take so long?\" The server responded with \"I don't know sometimes they just don't feel like making it\". My friend said \"are we allowed to sometimes not pay?\"  The server went to ring up our total - in plain site- and stood there mimicking and making fun of our table. When he came back with the bill I said \"is that funny over there?\" My friend said \"were you making fun of me over there?\" Here is the kicker - he said \"yeeeesss\".  After bringing us back our change he THEN said he was sorry. I said that should have been your first response. We let him know we will not be back, which bums me out because I really did enjoy this place. Granted, it's like a buffet wherein you serve yourself.  However, there are servers there to refill your drinks, take your special orders and so on- you should still have a sense of customer service.  I really hate to not return, but I'm not."}
{"text":"Place is VERY affordable with prices ranging from 1-2 dollars a plate for 4 pieces of sushi.   I was pleasantly surprised at the taste too because it may not look appealing but some of their creations really please the palet.   This is a good spot for a casual date because it shows youre cultured and can find a hidden gem tucked away behind in n out in chandler  I recommend this spot for anyone who wants a sushi fix at an affordable price."}
{"text":"This place is the best! Close to our home and not a time has it let us down ! We have been going to Teharu on Ray and man we're glad they opened up this one ! Better place , way nice and the Sushi was killer ! We will be back !"}
{"text":"No comparison to the one in chandler. Less quality less selections and less everything."}
{"text":"Love this place. Price is great and good is fabulous! It gets busy around noon but once ur seated it's fine. Have been here numerous times w not one complaint!"}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to sushi restaurant until last night.  I have been to this location 10+ times and never had any quality issues with the sushi itself, but last night I had 2 major issues that have caused me to confidently say I will never go back.  1. I picked a Philly Roll off the revolving line and it was not cold. This roll is always chilled at Teharu, but it was very room temperature and mushy.  Luckily, I didn't get sick but easily could have.  The roll was probably rotating on the line for hours and nobody quality controlled and took them off once they weren't at an appropriate serving temperature. (I've always been skeptical of this revolving bar style because I've never seen anyone checking temperatures or removing plates that have probably been sitting there for way too long). 2. My boyfriend had a 1 inch long fish bone in one of his California Rolls. Scary. Gross. There isn't even a whole piece of fish on that roll so where did that bone come from? The only reason I am giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because it has always been great sushi for a great price until last night."}
{"text":"My wife and I were starving for some good sushi and wanted to pig out on a budget. What better place then Haru Suhi, it was recommended to us by a friend thats live near there, and we were hooked. The place has a traditional REVOLVING sushi bar just like they do in Japan. ( you sit at the bar, and sushi comes around on a moving belt )  They always yell hello in japanese when you walk in and once your seated ( which sometimes you might have to wait if you wanna sit at the revolving bar)  you can sit down and start eating right a way. There is already sushi on moving belt, you just take the plate you want and start eating.  The portions are small but this way you get to try alot of different rolls and types of sushi instead of filling up on one or two rolls ( which is what I think what they wanted).   They charge you by the plate anything from $1.00-$2.00 and if you dont see anything you like they will make anything you want ( but charge you accordingly). I recommend the VEGAS roll, BAKED SCALLOP roll, HARU sushi, and SIZZILING SALMON are some of my favorites.  We were so full! (sushi coma) we had 14 plates ranging from $1-2  and our bill was $31 and some change, with tax, for the both of us. CHEAP!   anywhere else we would have spent $50 at least.  We go there at least once a week or every other week just to eat there, and we live in Central Phoenix. Its worth the drive for us."}
{"text":"My favorites are the salmon skin roll, the volcano roll and the baked mussels!  This is the only revolving sushi place I've been too, I have been here in a while only because it's in a hidden spot so I tend to forget about it..  If you want something that's not on the revolving table you can ask for it and they'll be it fresh for you."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go. They always have a wide selection and you can't beat the price. My boyfriend and I usually spend about $25-30 for both of us and we are usually stuffed by the time we get the check."}
{"text":"I have a love\hate relationship with this place.  I love the food here. I hate that they seem to have so little concern for their customers, that they make you wait over 30 minutes for a seat when half the restaurant is empty.  I love the prices but I hate the dirty looking floors.  Still I go because the sushi is good and the prices are right.  I recommend the Rainbow Roll, Hawaiian Roll, and the Haru Sushi. The Baked Scallop Roll is pretty good too.  If you don't see what you want, just ask. They seem happy enough to custom make you something."}
{"text":"I am not a big fish  fan, but do like to eat the sushi rolls.  I have been to Teharu Sushi a few times.  The staffs were friendly.  Prices are responsible, Happy Hour prices.  However,  the fish quality was not fresh according to my friends, which know sushi.  Arizona  needs more conveyor-belt style sushi restaurants  ."}
{"text":"I still love this place; the sushi and prices are really great but the service seemingly gets worse every time I come in. The service is slow and waiters hardly check up on you. I went my nearly my entire meal with en empty glass of water without someone close enough to flag down for a refill. Takes forever to get the check as well. Tonight in particular was a bit rough, as we had put our names down on the list and waited forty minutes only to realize that our name was skipped and they sat people ahead of us. Come here for the sushi, but don't expect much else."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to the location on Priest since it's a little more convenient for me, but tonight I went to this one since the wait was going to be a heck of a lot shorter. The sushi selection was the same as the Priest location, which was nice, but man was the service awful. We got seated immediately and got our waters relatively quickly but after that, it all went downhill. I think we were there for a little over an hour and someone came by once to check up, but we waited and waited for our check. We were clearly done - napkins on plates, looking at the time, glancing around - and all of the waitresses looked at us at one point or another but chose not to approach us. It took about twenty minutes and flagging someone down to finally get our check. The girl that helped us was sour, to say the least. Once she took our credit cards, she brought the checks to the front counter and LEFT OUR CARDS THERE while she went into the back. About a minute later, she came back out chewing something, so I can only assume that she left my debit card on the counter to go go the back and eat. How long does it take to run a card?"}
{"text":"Been to the original location in Tempe years back and always liked it. Have been here to this location a couple times and it's been growing on me. Especially since it's so close to us. For some reason we always seem to forget about it!? They're always are pretty busy but the wait is never too long. We really like the crab roll and the baked scallop roll amongst the usual suspects...spicy tuna, rainbow, eel...you can always order fresh hand rolls if you feel it's not a peak time. It's so inexpensive how can you not? Way fresher than your Frys fix grocery store sushi."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. I like the whole conveyor system and the price. The food isn't amazing, but its pretty good for the price. It's definitely a fun experience if you've never been to a conveyor sushi place. The service is hit or miss, sometimes they barely attend to you but others, like tonight, the servers are on it. The waitress that attended us not only with filling our drinks but also talked to us quite a bit about the different sushi options there were."}
{"text":"DANGEROUS!!!!! the fish was room temperature and the hot items were cold.  All of the items that we tried that were supposed to be cold were room temperature and all of the items that were supposed to be hot were stone cold.  This place is going to give people food poisoning, I expressed my concern to the manager and she did not seem to care. We left after a few plates of disappointing food and will not only never be returning, but will tell everyone we know to avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"worst experience I have ever experienced at this place no service no help I asked for more soy sauce they never came back and the waitress clocked out and never came back. My drink was empty and I had to ask a random worker for a refil. when it was finally time for me to leave I had to get up and stop a waitress and they had to add everything up for me. the sushi it's self is good but not worth my money to be spent here again."}
{"text":"Conveyor belt sushi restaurant. Sushi. On a conveyor belt. You really can't get much more simpler than that. At Teharu, you get what you pay for. Don't expect your dragon rolls to be spewing fire or your nigiri to be decorated with any garnishes or anything. If you want crazy fancy fish, go to RA; it's LITERALLY right down the road.  If you or any of your friends are new to the whole sushi thing, definitely try this place out. With the conveyor belt concept, you get to try out a little it of everything (About 3-4 pieces on average from around $1-2). Most of the rolls are pretty much modifications of the California Roll. If the belt looks empty, just try to steal an order sheet and give your waiter your order; *usually* you'll get all your stuff made. Ignoring the insanely long lines on the weekends, the service is not bad. If you want to be seated down quicker with a bigger group, try coming in on a Thursday night around 5:30 or 6. Both conveyor belts are open then.  The service is really nothing to much to brag about. Pretty much all the food is self-served. If you want something from the waiters, ask for it. They can't read your mind. And they all work collaboratively(You don't have one specific waiter serving you in other words).  At the end of the meal, you're probably going to pay under $20 for sushi and leave full. Again, don't expect much. You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Well, it's cheap, and novel (not too many conveyor sushi places around, and the only reason I went was because of this)  But the food, not so hot, or should I say cool...  It wasn't terribly busy when I went, and that was probably a bad thing, the conveyor is pretty big and was always full, but with few patrons the turnover was really low, and everything was warm. Nothing like a lukewarm mouthfull of clam, or tuna, or everything. All the fish was mealy tasting because of this.    Again, it's really cheap though, so think of buffet style sushi without the benefit of an ice bath.   With a plethora of other decent sushi options in the area, it's worth springing for the real thing, or as close to ad you can expect."}
{"text":"Who would have thought a sushi place with a conveyor belt would be found in the middle of the desert?  Well, when we found this place, my husband and I couldn't resist and decided to give it a try.  When we arrived, it was really busy, the seats around the \"bar\" area was completely full, but it looked like some people were getting ready to leave.  Eventual, it came time for us, and we were seated at the very end of the belt, right before it disappeared into the back.    At first, it seemed there was a good selection, we began to pull off plates, and then we began to realize that everything was spicy.  Then one by one, we began to regret our choices, the fish didn't seem so fresh, and anything that wasn't spicy, was not too fresh, I guess they make it all spicy to hid the old stuff.  I think it was a good try, but doesn't hold up to our standards, we have had some great sushi, so this isn't our kind of place."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi. Great prices. Teharu is a great place to get in and get out... while still getting good sushi. Prices are very reasonable. Parking is so-so during lunch hour."}
{"text":"Yes! YES! Hands down my favorite conveyor style sushi bar thus far. If you haven't tried the conveyor belt style yet you are missing out! I am always talking about this place and bringing new people here all the time! Why? I'm so happy you asked...  First, the price. We all know anytime you say hmm I want sushi tonight, the next thought is shit, where is my bank account at?? All of the plates here range from $1-$2. What?! The most expensive plate is $2?? Yes, you heard right. This gives you the opportunity to try EVERYTHING. I can easily go to this place once a week and not break the bank.  Now the belt has a lot of choices so as I said you can try them all. Don't see something you were craving?? Just ask your server and the chef will make it for you. Now some people may say that they are concerned with the freshness and that some items may be left on the belt for a while. Well now let's use common sense and watch the chef put new items out so that you can guarantee freshness.   The service, eh. It's not horrible enough to turn me away, but they are not harassing my table either. This place is ALWAYS busy though so expect a wait. The music is pretty horrid but I didn't come for the atmosphere damn it I came for the food!  Highly Recommend. The end."}
{"text":"Great place to go for some decent sushi at a great price. Went with my friend to the one in North Scottsdale. It's a small place so took about 10 minutes to seat, but that was ok. I like places like this. In and out place to eat. No stuffy people or waiters. Our waitress was nice. The staff greeted us as we came and went. Left a good tip! Definitely recommend. Would go again."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I come here frequently, and we usually have pretty decent service here. Friday night, however, must have been an off-night for them. We arrived around 5:30, and we only waited ten minutes to get seated, so that part wasn't bad. When we got seated, it took about ten minutes for someone to get our drink order and give us our wasabi dishes. That didn't happen until after we flagged someone down.  It's not like they were under-staffed because they weren't. They had seven servers there, but they seemed completely discombobulated. When we were ready to leave, we waited another fifteen minutes, and the only way we got our check was by me moving out into the isle. The other odd thing - there was a guy who was sitting at the table with a to-go container, taking up a lot of room. If he was getting something to go, he shouldn't have been sitting at the main area. But hey, that's just my thoughts.  It will be awhile before I come back, I think. Quite disappointing."}
{"text":"The food and prices are great, but the service is horrendous and consistently so. We've gone here many times and the service is always bad. You get seated right away, but are out of luck if you need to ever need something. The waiters and waitresses constantly walk by, but they won't make eye contact. I ordered some sushi rolls off the menu and never received them. It took 45 minutes after asking several waitresses. The waitress brought out more than I ordered and said I wouldn't have to pay for it. When we got the bill she had charged us for the rolls I never asked for. We even asked several waitresses about the rolls and everyone seemed to have forgotten about them. After terrible, neglectful service every time we finally are giving up on going here ever again."}
{"text":"Loved this place when they first opened in Tempe. Went there all the time with my girlfriends. But we moved to QC so the drive was just too far. But I has so happy to see they opened one closer to me. We went to check it out and it is just as good as Tempe. They have a few more non sushi menu items which made the husband happy. Their spicy ramen was tasty as well as the sushi. I love going here because I don't have to spend $10 a roll that I might not finish. This is a good place to take someone to introduce them to sushi too. Gives them an opportunity to try little bit of everything."}
{"text":"I am amazed this place has so many good reviews! Seriously, look at the Yelp pictures people. These \"sushi chefs\" do NOT know how to slice the fish very well! I think I could do a better job! The other problem I had was the temperature of the fish, not cold at all, and I'm talking about a bunch of nigiri I ordered to be specially made (wasn't sitting out on the conveyor). Look, I know not to expect super high quality sushi at a place like this, but Sushi Station does way better. Teharu needs to step it up some. I felt quite rumbly in the tummy for the next 24hrs. On a side note, it took FOREVER for our waiter to come by and bring us the check despite it not being super busy."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place. The conveyor belt is good for me because I'm still not real clear about the name of my favorites, and I don't have to wear my reading glasses to read a menu, I just take a plate that looks good. Moreover, they have Sapporo and Kirin beer."}
{"text":"The prices here are very reasonable for the high quality sushi you get. In my opinion, the  sushi is comparable to a more expensive sushi restaurant. Yet, you pay a third of the price. They add up the cost of your meal by the empty plates you have. Each plate is only $2 or $3. I've never had a meal that was over $10 and I always leave full and happy!  For someone who is indecisive like me, the fact that the plates come around on a conveyer belt so you can see each sushi dish is also very helpful! I love that concept.  I'd recommend the Las Vegas roll! It is one of our favorites."}
{"text":"This place is awful.... Every roll is exactly the same and mediocre at best. Service was poor and we continually had to ask for things. Avoid this place and go to Fry's, even that sushi is better."}
{"text":"Definitely the best selection for a revolving sushi bar around town. Good drink specials and sake bomb specials too. There is also a separate menu to order specific types of sushi. Staff is usually attentive, overall a good spot."}
{"text":"Still a great value for the price and if you don't have to wait to get seated, it's a darn quick lunch."}
{"text":"Let's start with my reaction when my boyfriend and I got the final bill...jaws drop and then we high-five. For as much as we ate on a Friday night, we walked out of there with a bill less than $20. INCREDIBLE.   An inexpensive bill always makes the food taste better in my opinion, but this place does have great sushi! Now don't get me wrong, it's not going to be the quality of stuff you might find in California, but for Arizona sushi, it gets the job done right. We tried the squid salad, cucumber salad, pork dumplings, the vegas roll, spicy tuna roll, crunchy roll, caterpillar roll, and a few others I can't seem to name. You get about 4 pieces of each roll which is great because it allows you to try more rolls without filling up too fast.   The rotating sushi bar is such a fun concept, because if something looks tasty, all you have to do is reach for it in time and grab it, then it's yours! Takes the pressure off of ordering sushi. It's a perfect spot for an inexpensive date night. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We come here often because it's fairly inexpensive and you can try a few different types of sushi. Are they the best quality rolls? no. You definitely get what you pay for. But for $6, I leave there satisfied. Also, as a lot of people mentioned, the service is pretty lousy and the wait staff always seem angry.   If you are going for lunch, get there before noon, as it gets fairly busy."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. The only bad thing is not getting a table and getting sat in the crowd of people around the main conveyor belt and prepping station. Most of the wait staff is pretty friendly, there a few who just go through the motions and don't give such a great experience.  We love the sushi here and it is great bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Service could have been better. Sushi was def non stop and a good variety and you can request something. The only thing is the sushi here is the dryest I've ever had. I've been to other sushi conveyor belt type places and this is okay compared to those. I wouldn't drive out of the way for this though."}
{"text":"Unbeatable for the price-- works out to be the same price as grocery store or Costco sushi. We go here once a week. I stay away from the tuna and salmon, which aren't great, but most options are crab based and there is a good variety. Always a good experience."}
{"text":"Really low quality sushi, I'd pass if I were you. The people that work here are nice. But everything seems diluted here--from the extremely thin sauces to the flavor. It's \"cheap sushi\" sure, but it's not worth it"}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop by if your in the mood for sushi and quick service. The sushi and other items come to you on a conveyor belt which is pretty neat  and a fun experience. During lunch / dinner is the times I've only gone and the food is always fresh and I assume because it's so busy. The food is totaled by the color of the plate you pull off the belt 1.00,1.50, 2.00..I think it goes up 4 dollars a plate. For my boyfriend and I including drinks the total was about $30.00. That's not bad at all for good sushi!"}
{"text":"Revolving Sushi-oh my! Walk-in, sit down, they take your drink order and off you go! Reach there and grab there and over there, just pluck different rolls off the revolving belt...love it....fresh and delicious! The Hawaiian roll is my favorite! You have to go and try it. If you like sushi you will love this place."}
{"text":"The fish is good and fresh. There are always people here. Me and my friend come here twice a week. That baked scallops are to die for.   The service is good. Our drinks are never empty. If you want a good value with good food, come here."}
{"text":"The sushi here is good and much better than the other location. The service here is definitely lacking and its downfall. Music is super loud."}
{"text":"Wait, a Korean-run kaiten-zushi joint with Hispanic sushi chefs? LOL, NO THANKS."}
{"text":"Hit or miss with this place. Please keep in mind we have been here before and we've had decent service. Don't expect much from them though. Especially the service, it's been the same for years and they all need a class or two. Today was a huge miss. Sat on the far left side at around 3pm. My family of 4 sat here for 25 minutes and none of the sushi on the left side had been replenished in that time. There are two belts. We ordered our own rolls to come out and that took 20 minutes until someone had finally asked if we were doing okay. We were fed up and just had them cancel our orders. Another couple next to us had ordered the same amount at the same time as us and there's had already came out. You get what you pay for, even then it's still not worth it including tip. We left hungry. Come here with caution."}
{"text":"Revolving Sushi. I love that I can sit down and immediately start eating, LOL. They have a lot of different rolls to choose from but sometimes they are all very similar. So far I like the Hawaiian roll the best. They also have other items at the revolving bar like cooked items and desserts. I believe they have a full menu you can order from as well."}
{"text":"Fun for kids because of conveyor belt, but the belt is it's downfall. Food travels around and around until you see a fresh dish or get tired of waiting and starving. It's the Furrs or Golden corral of sushi...just go to the super market instead and rifle through which sushi box you want. It might be much better if place is super busy though."}
{"text":"Really not good service. They were so focused on closing a section down then having customers.  She told me we would have to wait...  We come here more than once a week, well this was the last time for my team..."}
{"text":"I went to this location for the first time today. In fact it was my first time ever having the conveyor belt sushi experience. I must say with the very reasonable prices ($1-$3 per plate), the variety of food, and the wonderful atmosphere, this place is quite possibly my new favorite restaurant. I'm going to be eating here maybe once a week from here on out. You will definitely not be disappointed with the quality of food at this place as well. Try this out at least once, you will be very happy you did."}
{"text":"What a fun place to eat! This conveyor belt sushi bar is on the casual side and is quite popular. We went fairly early on a Sat (5:30 ish) and there were probably 15 people waiting for a spot. We didn't wait too long though, maybe 15-20 min. After being seated, you can begin eating immediately... well, as soon as something you like comes around the belt. There is a small sign before a series of plates with the name of what is on the plates- I wish it also had a small description since there were a few things that I wasn't familiar with and couldn't find online (mountain potato roll... tasty, but I have no idea what was in it). I liked that each plate only has 4 or so pieces, allowing you to try many different items and minimizes the risk of trying new things. Additionally, their prices are very reasonable, with no plates costing more than 2$. We enjoyed the mtn potato roll, the seared tuna, gyoza, inari, asparagus rolls, cream puffs (yuuuummm)... most everything. The edamame was kind of a waste... not salted, with some pods empty when we got them. Additionally, we didn't care for the vegas roll. Overall, we really enjoyed this place and would come back if we were in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Love Love LOVE sushi! I've actually been going to this place for a few years now and I love it. There are two things that I absolutely love about it. It's incredibly inexpensive and the sushi comes on a conveyer belt! What more can you ask for. =P  I think that the sushi itself is quite tasty for the price you pay. Each plate is between $1 to $3. Not to mention they have such a variety of sushi to choose from. Not only is the sushi cheap but even the drinks are reasonably priced! You can get a beer or glass of wine for $4. I usually HAVE to come here at least once a month to get my Teharu fix in for the month because I seriously love this place. I'm little so I'm usually full after maybe $3 or $4 worth of sushi. lol. My favorite roll there is the baked scallop roll. It's basically a California roll with baked scallop on top and it comes out nice and warm for you. =)  The staff is also very friendly and helpful. They're very good at bringing you what you need quickly, no doubt about it.   I think one of the  downfalls is if you come in the evening or on the weekends there is a pretty long wait to get seated. Also, if you come during the day or when it is less busy they don't have a big variety of a sushi selection like they would when it was busy. But don't worry, because it is DEFINITELY worth the wait. =)"}
{"text":"Great food and service! I love going here because you get to choice what you want to eat, and how much you want! If their is something not on the revolving sushi belt, you can ask to have it ordered. I enjoy going here and would recommend to anyone who wants to try sushi, or a die hard sushi fan!"}
{"text":"Arrived and signed in, waited about 20 min - not bad-  we were next to be seated and the party that arrived after us (since they greeted the waiter I'm assuming, regulars with VIP service) was seated right away... Really? The belt experience was semi-ok and the Sushi is kinda supermarket quality, and you better hunt the plates that are just being added to the belt if you want fresh. It's a busy place but as far as customer service is 2 out of 5 (waitress took about 15 minutes to get us water) Long story short, decent place if you didn't have to be rushed out of there, would consider to go back, after all the food is cheap =)"}
{"text":"The boys loved the revolving bar. The waitresses were very friendly & helpful to the boys . Great place Cameron loved it."}
{"text":"Now, first of all, I am giving this place 5 stars KNOWING that it isn't all that \"authentic\". The guy making the sushi is named Juan. The sushi is going in circles. There is awful K-pop on the speakers.  And yet, the place is where I go when I want sushi, and it never fails to deliver. It has a good mix of \"real\" sushi and \"American\" sushi, and everything is fresh and delicious. The conveyor belt is a fun way to pick and choose what you want to eat.  Even my wife, who is quite picky, has found a couple of things she now eats at all sushi places (cali roll, spicy crab and shrimp roll, edimame).  You can order specific rolls if you don't see them coming up (Baked Scallop Cali Roll), and count on delicious Las Vegas Rolls and Mountain Potato Rolls to kick the flavor up a notch."}
{"text":"Revolving Sushi!!!  We love the original location in Ahwatukee/Tempe, so when we saw this had opened up by our friend's place, dinner was decided. The sushi was just a shade below the original standard (still good), but the location was more spacious and less packed. Also, the service was much more personable.  The prices are still crazy low, and my wife and I ate ourselves sick with too much sushi for under 30 bucks. We will be back, and you should stop in too, even if just for a snack (ya know, like anything under 8 plates)."}
{"text":"Love it.  Lines are long during dinner hours but its worth it.  each plate is anywhere between 1$ to 3$.  there are a lot of varieties and you can even order directly.   if you dont like the sushi, there are other food options availables."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to Teharu - all I can say is it's not the way I recall. We waited 45 min for our order and had to ask for a status 3 times.   While sushi may be cheaper than the rest, not worth the lack of quality and chaotic service."}
{"text":"This is a cheap place for lunch and the revolving sushi is the main attraction and a neat feature. Overall the food is good and the service is quick and friendly. I would not recommend this place for a fine dining sushi restaurant.  Tip: Make sure to check the times when they are open because there are certain times throughout the day they are closed. That being said, the best time to come is when they first open up rather than coming near closing times. Choices are plentiful and the freshest during opening/busier times."}
{"text":"This is the only conveyer belt sushi place I have been to so it's exciting and novel for me.  I live the fact that you can sit down and immediately start eating.  I tend to stick with the Philly roll because they put more cream cheese than most sushi places.  I love that because I love cream cheese.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because the wait can be a challenge and you can never be sure how long certain rolls have been sitting out."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to this location for about two years since the location on Ray and Priest has been going downhill. We have noticed that over the past few months, the service has been lacking terribly. Our favorite people are no longer there and the one girl that has been there for some time is not friendly. The newer people there seem to be oblivious. We got seated tonight and no one came over to take our drink order for about fifteen/twenty minutes. We actually had to wave someone down. When the time came for us to get our check, it took us a bit to actually wave someone down. The sushi chefs were amazing though. We sat next to where they put the food out and they were funny and super nice. I'm sad to be lowering my review and honestly, I do not know if they will actually read the reviews, but if things do not improve, we may need to find a new sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Anthony is awesome! Super chill, down-to-earth waiter. I always tell him what's up whenever I'm at Teharu. Also, the food is way cheap for what you get. Cheapest sushi in Tempe/Chandler! You can get a meal that fills you up and a sake bomb for like $15. Unreal.  I don't get how some of these reviews criticize this place. It's awesome, never had a bad experience there."}
{"text":"Best, cheapest way to obtain a fantastic variety of sushi all within a vibrant atmosphere!"}
{"text":"For the price and convenience factor you can't beat it.  Sushi is run of the mill and fresh - service is good because they aren't in your face every 2 minutes."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and always prompt service. Food is good, but not a fan of the soup. Price is good even though we eat like 10 plates."}
{"text":"I like this place. My partner and I pigged out and the bill was only 20 bucks! There are other places I would go for sashimi, but when I need a sushi fix close to home, this is a great place!"}
{"text":"Pretty good price for a decent sushi! I would recommend coming with friends casually. The ????reminds me of staying in Japan"}
{"text":"It isn't the best sushi but definitely the best tasting sushi for the price. I've been to Teharu at least 5 times and every time I go I get great service and you can ask for specific rolls if you don't see them on the conveyer belt. Definitely worth trying for a quick, satisfying lunch or fun dinner."}
{"text":"Teharu is so good!  I am always satisfied with everything I get there.  The sushi is awesome and not expensive at all.  Anthony was my waiter last time and he is super helpful.  I love coming here with friends.  My favorites are the haru sushi, rainbow roll and crunch roll.  Anything you cant find on the conveyor belt they are happy to make for you.  Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I am a regular but three major mistakes were made in my visit.  Ran out of Uni (Sea Urchin),  the salmon eggs were filled with sake (a trick that sushi chef used to cover up the spoilage of the caviar-Can't lie to a former chef like myself), and avocado eel roll served without the eels inside.  Had to complained about mistake number #3..Was fixed but still very sub-standard.  It takes years to train someone to have the precision and allowing amateur Hispanic female sushi chef (major break in tradition--In Japan, they will never allow woman to touch sushi) at a busy restaurant is a major disappointment.  I am not a sexist but to serve a sub-standard product to anyone is unacceptable.  Service was nice so I would have to think very hard to return again."}
{"text":"I love the concept! This place is great for groups because you can try a lot of new things, and if you don't like it, someone else in the group will. Going with a group also reduces your bill, so it comes out to $7-10 per person. I think the quality of the sushi is lacking, but I don't think anyone expects beautiful, decorated rolls when the chefs are producing dozens of rolls in minutes. The fun of selecting sushi off a conveyer belt, and the practicality of doing this with a group are what keep bringing me back. The rolls themselves aren't the best though."}
{"text":"After being here a couple times, I was sure today would be a good day to stop in and grab some sushi while waiting for my car to get serviced but maybe I came in on the wrong day. I sat down and must have waiting over  5 minutes before I had to flag some one down to order a green ice tea which never came. I had to also flag someone down to get some chopsticks and sushi setup so I could eat. I again (for the 3rd time) flagged someone down to get the green iced tea which finally came out but they brought me regular ice tea. At that point, I had eaten a few dishes and basically was done and really wanted to pay and leave. I really hate to be negative but I just did not have a good experience here that day (3 days ago) and probably will not come back. As much as I love sushi, guess it's best to truly go to other places."}
{"text":"If you are on a tight budget, this place is great to get your sushi fix!  However, for those who can afford to pay a little more, it would be worth it to spend a few more bucks to get your sushi elsewhere.  We came on a Wednesday night with a party of 3 and still had to wait 20 minutes for a spot at the conveyor belt bar.  For a conveyor belt restaurant, you would think the bar area would be bigger!  And for some odd reason half the restaurant is just regular tables, but no one sits there bc obviously... you want to be at the conveyor belt where the sushi is.  The quality of the sushi that came out was... not that great.  I appreciated the fact that there was variety in the dishes and a lot of things I usually don't see or try at sushi restaurants.    I don't think I'd be back here again, when I have other favorite sushi restaurants with better quality fish."}
{"text":"Great place for good food. The food is on a carousel so you can start eating right away...good when you want something good and quick!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! The sushi is wonderful! The wait staff....not so much. They really need to get waitresses that give a damn."}
{"text":"Pros: great location, clean dining area, and inexpensive sushi. There might be a little wait time when they are busy, but once you are seated, you can eat right away.  Cons: service is painfully slow. They bring you drinks right away, but if you need refills or additional requests, it's hard to track down a waitress. They also took away the ginger from each table so you have to request it. Conveyer belt can become empty quickly when they are busy. Most of the rolls includes imitation crab seasoned with mayo. If you don't like imitation crab, selection is very limited."}
{"text":"Great spot for quick inexpensive sushi. The fish is fresh they make it constantly and service is good as well. I would highly recommend if you're looking for a quick bite to eat and not spending lots of money."}
{"text":"UPDATED:   Yep, been back a few times since my original review and I still feel the same.  I guess I should add that they are consistent.   Still good sushi, still a good price.  The only change...  There is a new server who literally put my kid in his place, scooting his chair up to the table and telling him to eat... some parents may be upset, but I think my kid needed to hear it from a different adult.  LOL. So I didn't mind.  Decent sushi at a reasonable price.  We go here often.  My only concern is that since it is served off of a conveyor belt, sometimes the sushi is room temp and the items that are supposed to be hot are cold.  We always order off of the sushi menu.  We do love it though.  Great for a much needed sushi fix.  I am changing my review to reflect 4 stars because after visiting a competitor I am left realizing that this place is extremely inexpensive for sushi..."}
{"text":"Revolving sushi it's always fun for the novelty factor! It's what you would expect quality wise, it is yummy but not the highest quality! I loved the cream puffs, which are something I don't usually like but these were not overly sweet.  The gyoza were absolutely  delightful. I also thoroughly enjoyed jalapeño poppers!! The service is iffy, both times I've been they have been pretty abrupt and this last time they didn't bring my friend the drinks she ordered at the very beginning, she had to ask a second time after quite a bit of time when the server came back around. Overall it's a fun place for the conveyor belt experience."}
{"text":"They advertise that they are open till 9 but stop making sushi at 8pm so if you come in after 8 you will have no choice for sushi. To be honest that is bad customer service if you advertise your establishment till 9 you need to have the food available till 9.   This is bad customer service and I am not looking to comeback to this place."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Teharu off-and-on for a few years now.  The price, the K-pop, and the cool conveyor belt sushi keeps me interested but that's all the perks of the establishment.    The quality of Teharu isn't exactly the freshest and the portions keeps getting smaller and smaller.  But for the cheap price, what can you really expect?  Service is usually lacking and slow but I blame management.  They have such a big staff size for the dinner rush but the workers are just everywhere!    This is by far not my favorite place for sushi but it's cheap eats for those days when you splurged on a new designer  purse or a new pair of shoes."}
{"text":"For the food, this is probably my favorite sushi place so far. I love the moving slide with tons of different sushi on it, you just pick whatever inspires you most. You can't miss the spicy tuna...absolutely divine!!! Prices are incredible: according to the plate's color, it's a buck or two each! The beignets are good, they would be even better if they weren't frozen. Perhaps next time I'll go with the cheesecake. Also the atmosphere is not really oriental. Too loud in my opinion. I'm glad they do good business though...We were a party of five on a Thursday night and I really didn't pay too much attention to our service. But I heard they're open for lunch too. I'll come back to give five stars maybe??? ;-)"}
{"text":"Teharu Sushi?  Iloveyou Sushi.  I absolutely love conveyor belt sushi, and this is one of the best I've seen.  There's a variety of rolls, the staff members are friendly, and prices are excellent.  Some conveyor belt sushi places have got it into their heads that they can increase the price for the experience, but this place stays true to serving the reason why conveyor belt sushi joints exist - allowing Americans to stuff themselves until they have to be literally rolled out the door.  And Teharu Sushi did exactly that.  When our waitress came over to count up our plate totals, she made a little \"oh!\" noise and her eyes got really big before she politely smiled and brought us our (tiny) check.  We ate that much, and it was that good."}
{"text":"So I have only been here once and it was my first time at a conveyor belt sushi restaurant. I have eaten at a lot of different sushi restaurants around the valley and I must say I was not very impressed. The prices are great, the staff are super friendly and nice, but the sushi was blah. I went with a few friends and we all really love sushi but this place just did not impress. It was a cool experience and I might try and find another conveyor style place to check out but I wont be going back to Teharu."}
{"text":"Teharu is one of those places where you go when you're in the area and you want some quick and cheap sushi.  It's not the best sushi, but it's decent enough and the prices are definitely right!  Also, I liked that they extended the conveyor belt to the tables at the far end of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Probably the best roll sushi I've had in my life, conveyer belt or otherwise, Japan or elsewhere.  I was pretty shocked.  Delicious and fresh at 2:30 PM....  We actually had to wait just a minute for a couple seats at the belt.  All the rolls we tried were great.  The Shaggy Dog roll seemed to be the house specialty and was specifically excellent.  Squid salad also great.  They didn't have much nigiri on the belt, and what they had wasn't awesome... but you're at a conveyor belt sushi place with rolls that _are_ awesome, so who cares?  I'm super bummed that this place isn't anywhere near where I work.  I'd be here all the time for quick and delicious lunch."}
{"text":"I love this place for the price and variety. If you are looking for a lot of sushi for a low price, this is it. I have found it to be hit and miss recently due to what I can only describe at concerns of cleanliness. The ladies handling the tubs of rice don't wear gloves and I found a huge hair embedded into one of my rolls due to the sushi chefs not wearing hair nets."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst restaurant I have ever been to, the waitress was so ILL mannered. She literally threw plates at us and stomped water glasses kept shouting at us. I didn't even eat anything just wanted to leave that place. I am never going back there unless I get a proper apology from Taharu."}
{"text":"I used to like Teharu, but it has gone from being fresh and cutting edge to questionable in quality and consistency.  Never have I seen a restaurant go downhill so fast, from a great place to pick up some quick Nigiri, to an endless hell of hastily thrown together sushi where the cheap, throw away items are plentiful but where the gems are few and far between.  Good price, but not worth the money in my opinion.  Also, kinda dirty."}
{"text":"Solid place. I used to live right by this place and now I work right by here and it's always a good go to when you want cheap food and a lot of it.  It is good sushi. Not great but not bad. Sometimes a roll will come around and it won't be very fresh but eh what's a $1.50 loss. Whenever I bring someone to this place they are like a kid in a candy store  \"you mean I can have all this sushi and walk out with a bill less than $10?!?!\" The answer is yes, you can!!!"}
{"text":"For a group of many tastes this revolving sushi bar is great.  We also requested specific kinds of rolls we wanted at no additional cost.  We are now fans"}
{"text":"I love coming here once in awhile, my friend from out of state was very happy, he had placed an order and it came out tasting amazing. The service was okay."}
{"text":"As far as revolving sushi goes, this place earned the 5 stars with cleanliness and freshness. As others have said, there is nothing radical or life altering about the sushi, but the quality was good and the value was excellent! It was $23 for 2 of us including drinks and we were stuffed! Also looks like a great place to bring kids. There were several families and the kids were having a blast watching the options go by and guessing what was what.  The only semi-negative was that even on a Tuesday, the wait was about 25 minutes. Wasn't fun waiting, but at least that shows how many folks love this place and once you are seated you can start eating immediately instead of waiting to place an order.  Will definitely be trying again!"}
{"text":"Mediocre sushi. But of course you can't expect something extravagant when it's going around on a conveyer belt all day. But for the price you pay it's pretty good. Special orders come out fairly quick for the most part. Would've given this place more stars if I hadn't come across cockroaches running around the dining room. Brings up some concern relating to their food safety."}
{"text":"Good eats low price. Rotating sushi on a conveyor belt. No soda fountain so no free refills. Fresh fish, only place I can eat sushi till I explode for under 25 bucks for 2 people. Yumyumyum"}
{"text":"This place used to be great. The quality of service in the last year has gone in the trash. They don't fill drinks, the skip you when you've been waiting in a party of 2 in order to seat new comer larger parties(3 or more) they seat people who are friends when they walk in and just sit in a free seat and the quality of the food has dropped. I used to love coming here but this will be the last time."}
{"text":"I stopped going to Teharu on Ray Rd due to service and food quality. I could not be happier to have found this location. The fish is fresh, the service top notch and the wait was non existent. I am happy to have somewhere we can go again to enjoy good inexpensive sushi."}
{"text":"This place  is awesome, I ate  there for the first time yesterday in  Tempe  ...sushi yumness ..especially the crab with tuna and avocado ...I forgot what it's called pics follow !.. My SUGGETION PLEASE OPEN TEHARU SUSHI  AT WESTGATE ON THE WESTSIDE so we don't have to travel this far for this yumminess ..thank you !"}
{"text":"A curious place to be sure. On my first visit, the staff was shorthanded and busy. No one explained how the service worked or how much each plate cost. (I later discovered the following: yellow plates = $1, green = $1.50, blue=$2.) I was relieved to discover my tiger roll (blue plates, 4 pieces each) was only $2 each. The waitress did have GF tamari, but did not bring it out for about 10 minutes, and took longer to catch her for my bill.  On my second visit, the waitresses were available, quick to help. The food is tasty and very inexpensive.   So all told, the carousel makes trying something new easy and fast, and you can't beat the price, but you have to be persistent on getting your waitress."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of the local sushi place that I lived above while I was teaching English in Japan. Nothing fancy, just good sushi that is not horribly expensive. Is it the best sushi in town? No. But it comes to you on a conveyor belt! How can you not like that.   They have a location in Tempe/Chandeler (off Priest/Ray) and it is also as good. But this one had the best selection I have seen since I started coming to this \"chain\"."}
{"text":"Long waits! Slow slow slow! And rude!  People are into the gimmick of the revolving sushi counter. But slow, bad service at a place you SERVE YOURSELF? No thanks.   Showed up at 7PM on Wednesday night and there was a long line. Not gonna happen. So I went to Perfect Pear next door. Showed up the next night at 930 PM on Thursday. No line, but I was ignored by several slow-motion staff and could never get seated. I asked if I could sit at one of the empty spaces at the counter and got some attitude and was told to wait. Wrong answer. So I went to RA Sushi down the street."}
{"text":"This was really pleasant!  I met some friends for lunch on a Sunday afternoon, it wasn't busy when I got there, but it picked up before we left.   Our table was adjacent to the conveyor belt....which made it awkward for the person on the outside seat. But we managed and it became a part of our conversation.  If you back is to the sushi coming at you, you need to ask the person sitting across from you to grab it.  I appreciate the wait staff, they were courteous and not too bothersome.  I tried a few of the salads...seaweed and squid....the creme puffs for dessert and a stack of plates of various fish, shellfish and one roll..the spicy tuna.  Not bad for the money!  and it was a nice place to get conversation in....it's clean, bright and best of all, you don't have to wait for your order."}
{"text":"Not bad. It's all on the conveyer belt, so you may grab a plate that's not as fresh as something else. It's novel to westerners when they encounter the conveyer belt, but this is how it goes down in JP (been there, done it for years). The sushi was ok. Not the best I've had to be honest, but I would recommend this place to anyone wanting a cleaner eat, not too much wait, and great pricing."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is reasonably priced and delicious but the service IS THE WORST! It took 40 min for my shrimp tampura to come out and when I asked if she had put my order in she said she forgot with a quick \"sorry!\" Before running away. The food line doesn't have as much variety as it used to ! I order ebi's that are rarely added to the rotation. They no longer serve taco's  . The whole place gives the overall impression of not being organized. You have waiters literally running from one end of the building to another  dropping things shouting at other waiters and the cooks from across the floor. Basically any time we need anything it's a hassle to get without waving someone down and waiting an extra 15-25 min. The person who sits you down isn't the waiter don't be fooled! They won't come check on you or refill your beverages. But besides the big negative the food is good and at such a great price. My boyfriend waited 30min for his food that never arrived and when I asked to speak to a manager the manager told me there was nothing he can do and the price of the meals remained. No discounts or anything and when I told him how upset we were he said \"everyone is in the same boat and waiting long times\" as if that made it okay..... not too mention we waited 30-40 min to be seated in the first place. No remorse NO APOLOGY And he didn't even look at me while having this conversation. I understand you can be busy but in the cs food industry number one rule is BE TENTATIVE. It was so shocking that he did not care even the slightest bit that our experience was one of the worst we've ever had. In total customers are seated and forgotten  and the manager clearly has no professional respect for the customers that provide his paycheck and the waiters don't get tipped due to their lack of CUSTOMER SERVICE. I'm not a massive complainer only when it surpasses the usual. This place was a HUGE disappointment over and over again. NEVER COMING BACK AND I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT unless you have a couple hours to spend WAITING.  We do however LOVE the Superstition location. Waiters stop by and check on multiple times. They provide and actually done in restaurant experience and the food is also high quality for the price you pay. It's a bit more expensive the honestly the customer service makes it worth it.   Customer service here SUCKS. And so does the managers"}
{"text":"The sushi was good at a great price; however I waited for 25min for an order I put in to come out. When a server finally passed by I asked when it was coming out only to find that they didn't have any left but didn't feel the need to tell Me. This restaurant chain lacks customer service at every location. It seems disorganized and un-disciplined. The server isn't really even your server except to sit you down and grab the check. Rarely will they stop by to check on you or get a refill. If you come to a Teharu sushi make sure you have the time to wait. There's ALOT of waiting . . . ."}
{"text":"No. Just don't do it. I have been to this location once during lunch time and was ignored and waiting forever. It's been probably a year and I decided to give it another shot. I went during a dead time, when the bar is closed and only tables are open. I still had to wait just to be sat and get my check. The sushi looked...not so fresh. I feel like that minimize the items they make during dead times which is fine, but use fresh fish, not something that looks like it's been sitting out for hours. Here's hoping I don't get food poisoning. Travel down Ray a little bit and find way more sushi places at the same prices."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go get cheap sushi.  The sushi is on a belt that goes in a loop which is pretty cool.  Best bang for the buck sushi.  Service is great here as well.  The octopus and squid sushi is the best in my opinion.  I know not many folks like it because its chewy.  Got to be open minded and explore!"}
{"text":"Sushi varieties come out on a conveyor belt!   You can order off the menu too. Grabbed a cucumber salad which was yummy.  Shaggy dog roll was good too!"}
{"text":"Still a fan of Teharu.   Here's something people are missing - The sushi is on a conveyor belt, and the plates are a max of $2 bucks each. Stop expecting to see famed Scottsman Gordon Ramsay rolling up your fish and rice back there. Come in with realistic expectations.  What Teharu is: Fun Cheap Loud (but I dig that environment sometimes) Great for groups  What it isn't: Michelin rated  Put some expectations aside, or go elsewhere. For the rest of us - We'll be smart enough to order a fresh roll via the menu (yes you can) anytime something looks questionable. It's on you, if you don't do that. There's a reason the lines are out the door."}
{"text":"This Teharu is actually better than the Priest location. Props to the chefs behind the bar. The rice is softer and the right temperature. The only removal of the star went to the inattentive nature of the two servers when we first arrived.  Although I did notice, as it was only 4pm, the had two girls working the floor. Once the dinner crowd started arriving there were more servers coming in for their shift.   Thanks Teharu for keeping it legit and consistent on a budget."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, nothing fancy but has some good choices......even some items that aren't typically sushi items (poppers....and cream puffs)"}
{"text":"2 stars for being treated rudely by the server. if for the sushi...i would say it's cheap and they do offer a variety of sushi. they have appetizers and desserts at the revolving table. it can get busy and crowded on weekends so i suggest to get there early."}
{"text":"So I am a newbie when it comes to sushi, but Ive fallen in love with it and fallen in love with this place. I hate going to restaurants and only being able to try a few rolls and already having a tab of 30 bucks. This place I tried so many different rolls on their badass conveyer belt and its sooo not expensive. Each plate is between 1.5 dollars to 3 bucks. We had a stack of plates and 4 big brewjas and it only came out to 40 dollars.... Will definitely be back loved the atmosphere and the chill mood."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!! Conveyor belt sushi has not the best rep but the quality is great. Two can eat heartily for about $30. All the tuna and salmon rolls are excellent. They also do baked scallops, but not a lot. Grab them fast when you see them."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre but really cheap.   We went on a Friday about 7pm with a group of 5, took about 20 min to seat us because the place was packed.   The rolls were yummy. My hubby disliked the sashimi because the ones he grabbed had been on the conveyor too long and were warm. Its biggest feature is also its biggest drawback. They should have some sort of marking system for when dishes go out, so that if they're not picked up by anyone fast enough they toss them.   It took them a while to get the check and they had issues splitting it."}
{"text":"My favorite place for sushi. The sushi is good and the concept of a revolving sushi bar that lets you try many different types is genius. The price is very reasonable. I just wish I could go more often."}
{"text":"I have become a regular here, it's so hard not to when it's so close and so delicious. I love the set up, it's so fast and convenient. Oh and the prices are unbeatable. The staff is always very nice and on point. CHEAP CHEAP sushi that you can't get anywhere else in this area and it is also very tasty!"}
{"text":"For a quick sushi fix, this place is awesome because you get to try a little bit of everything for cheap. We came around noon on a Sunday and it was super busy, the entire restaurant was full and there was about 20 people waiting. We waited for about 20-30 minutes and got to sit at the bar and from there it was time to dig in!! I like that you don't need a lot of service once you're seated because everything you need is infront of you, soy sauce, ginger, wasabi. They're definitely understaffed when it's busy though, there were only 3 servers for the entire restaurant."}
{"text":"Terrible. It's my youngest sons birthday and all he asked for for dinner was sushi. AYCE sushi. I searched Yelp and saw Teharu. 10 minutes away? Sweet! After a 45 minute wait (not too bad for a Friday night), we were seated in the far back corner by the bar to accommodate my daughters wheelchair. Cool. Then the fun started.  There was food all over my seat, and the floor- omg. Rolls, napkins, rice, edamame, and something sticky that refused to come off the bottom off my shoe. I pointed it all out to the waitress and she shrugged. Okay, alright, ya'll are busy, I'll deal. I should have left. I grab some edamame for the youngest, and we order drinks. My oldest grabs two plates and I grab one. I take a bite...YUCK. Stale rice, warm crab salad and not fresh. I get the jalepeno poppers- tasty. Okay yay. I snag another roll, getting into the \"flow\". A Las Vegas roll. Deep fried roll. Hot and crunchy, yeah? Nope. It's cold. Cold and soggy, and the avocado is BLACK. Not brown, but black.   I look over at my oldest and realize he's had 3 plates. My garbage disposal looks at me and says, \"Mom, I tried because I didn't want to waste our money not eating, but if I take one more bite I'm gonna throw up.\" Poor kid didn't realize you don't pay a flat AYCE fee, but by the plate. I flagged the waitress down. After I showed her the black avocado on the cold deep fried roll, she removed it from the bill. I paid the $25 for 8 barely touched plates and got the hell out of there. We're all still hungry at this point and decided to head to our go- to dinner spot for birthdays- The Cheesecake Factory- where we were served by friendly servers and my boy got his Happy Birthday song. We will not be back."}
{"text":"I really do enjoy coming here. Fun little hole in the wall place. The sushi is well priced for what you get. You   don't leave hungry when you come here. I do wish it was closer to my work so I could go there for lunch. It is a little out of my way. But totally worth the drive."}
{"text":"I've been to Teharu a couple of times now and while I like the size of the revolving sushi bar itself, the options of sushi seem to be quite limited. I find that I usually get the same three options because everything else is pretty much the same. Spicy tuna, tuna salad, california roll with tuna on top, etc. The las vegas roll and the shrimp roll are pretty much the only tasty items they put on there. Everything else seems to be a derivative of tuna."}
{"text":"No no no! The only good thing is that the price is cheap.. flies and gnats everywhere! Flying out of the toilet seats.. swarming tables including ours. We stopped mid meal trying not to throw up from the thought of these bugs on or even in our food"}
{"text":"I would def go here again!  Its conveyor belt style which means you dont have to wait for the waiter to come and take your order and then deliver it.  This is entirely satisfying when you are hungry and impatient.  What you sacrifice is a little but of variety, but usually a little patience and what you are waiting for will come crawling by. The quality of the fish was very good.  No complaints, and right on par with RA and other valley sushi locations. The prices are freekin amazing here.  Where else can you stuff your gut with Sushi and have a $15 bill?  Seriously!  And for those that are price weary, the plates are color coded so it is really easy to calculate your bill as you eat!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever ! Did not welcome us as we came in and did not follow the waiting list. We put our names in and they completely skipped us and also I was rudely treated I had to leave this place immediately!"}
{"text":"My mom brought me here for lunch after DD's swim lesson.  The place was jam packed with people waiting to be seated near the sushi belt.  We asked the host how long the wait would be and he generously offered to open up a table for us, if we would let him retrieve our sushi for us instead.  So, we bit.  What was a little annoying was that there were at least five parties ahead of us who could have filled the other tables, but they were made to wait.  A better solution was obvious, to us (at least).  Why not open up the second belt?  We suggested this to the host/waiter, but he said they only open up the second belt at dinnertime.  I understand what your normal operation is, but when you have a full restaurant...   Anyway, two tables were sat after we got our food and three or more of the original parties were still there when we left.  Would I wait that long to sit near a belt?  No way.  The good part about Teharu is that it is decent quality sushi (nothing special) for SUPER CHEAP.  Four adults and 1 child got away with a $38 bill, including one large beer ($4) two soft drinks and a juice.  Also, that included shrimp tempura and a bowl of rice for the little one.    The bad part is that the shrimp tempura was not completely cooked (the batter was still somewhat undercooked on a couple pieces).    Also, the music was quite loud.  It wasn't really my style.  As an aside... They were playing a Pandora station with commercials and all... I don't think Pandora would be too happy about that, either!  I think you have to have a commercial license for that!  It appears to be a clean place, so eat here with confidence.  Overall, I would eat here again if it pleased my mother.  Still, I wouldn't head to this place on my own.  I favor Mido Sushi (just a few blocks away) for many reasons."}
{"text":"Cheap sushi - that is a good way to describe this place.  Have you heard the phrase \"You pay for what you get\"  Really, I don't like to spend a lot for food unless it warrants. But come on this is a grade above gas station sushi.  A former friend talked about this place so we tried it and was waiting for more of a variety of sushi to come out and never did.  The only good thing is the prices"}
{"text":"Haru Sushi is worth the time.   The biggest draw is the speed and the price.  You can be eating as fast as you can take a plate off of the conveyor.  We've fed two people regularly for $20 each time and we leave full.  The quality of the sushi is average.  We have always found the service to be very helpful and timely.  We will be returning often."}
{"text":"Sadly, this was one of the worst experience I had with Teharu.  My mother, fiance and I went around 1pm, wasn't too busy.  We didn't have plates or napkins (my mother grabbed them from another table). Man that food was cold!  The gyoza was cold, the sushi was room temperature/warm.  After eating two pieces of sushi I began to feel nauseous and not right in the stomach.  It took the waitress 10 minutes to even check on us and ask about our drinks. After waiting another 10 minutes to even get our check we told the waitress that the food we ate was cold or room temperature. Thankfully, the food we didn't eat she took off our bill. 17$ after tip for 3 people it really wasn't worth it...especially the sick to the stomach feeling after we all left.  Sadly, we will go to Teharu in Tempe or Osaka's right in the same plaza."}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi restaurant in the valley. It is great for lunch breaks since the sushi is ready to eat as soon as you sit down. The fish is a great price for what you pay and I think the quality is a bit better at this location than the original one. The service is also better at this location as well. The salmon nigiri and the shaggy dog roll are my absolute favorite. You can easily fill yourself up for under 10 here. I will keep coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Teharu Sushi is a fun place to go as you can sit at the conveyor belt or sit at a table where the belt is within reach  .  Price is low and allows you to start lunch/dinner right away which is nice when you are hungry. You may have to wait until what you like goes nearby though as you have a lot of options to choose from.  I like the baked scallops and sometimes they are none on the belt so you can ask directly your waitress for it and they'll bring it to you directly at your table, which is nice.  Most of the rolls are 4 pieces, which is okay for the price you pay. Stacking up the plates if a fun exercise and you can see pictures with a lot of plates from customers.  Lunch can be busy and waiting is not uncommon but it goes usually pretty fast and voila, you are part of the bang wagon!  You won't find individual rolls here like you would as Sushi Eye, it's 100% conveyor. No Hand rolls either, deal with it!  I like the concept as far as it stays cheap but good enough to come back again. Don't expect extravaganza here, bells and whistles are out of the equation.   Appropriate if you are wallet conscious but still want the fun!"}
{"text":"First time, came late but was so good followed up the night after cant wait for the seared salmon!"}
{"text":"Disgusting! I feel like this place belongs on a dirty dining report somewhere.  - No covers over the plates on the conveyor belt. - Thick build-up of dust on the ventilation system right over where food is being prepared - Busser cart full of dirty dishes being pushed around in the main dining areas - Long, long lines with tables/seat going unbussed for prolonged periods of time - Rude and disorganized staff  Do yourself the favor, keep driving and go down to Sushi Eye or Sakana."}
{"text":"This place was great! My mom and I went for a late lunch today. I found it because I was looking for a place near the Mesa airport. Great find!! The sushi was so fresh and tasted amazing. My favorites were the crunch roll and the California roll! Highly recommend this place. The staff was very friendly as well. They need to open one on the Westside now!"}
{"text":"Nothing beats California sushi, but I wouldn't really go anywhere else for sushi if I was in AZ and wasn't in the mood to spend more than $40. Served on a conveyor belt this is definitely a must try sushi joint.  My boyfriend and I came on a random night, walked in, ate, and left in 20 minutes. Plus tip, under $25.  Friendly staff but not very knowledgeable. Don't ask a waiter what's inside a sushi if you're curious or like me worry about someone eating something they are allergic to."}
