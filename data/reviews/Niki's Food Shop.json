{"text":"Food is good but can be very, very salty!! Quick service, but i do suggest you call in and pick up. Parking is a nightmare. If you don't know, you will be told immediately and multiple times, \"cash only\". Must be one of the rules of hood operations."}
{"text":"I went this morning an got the bad service from the Spanish girl with the flower leggings on. She put my order in last after people came after me. She didn't smile. The sandwich wasn't good want be going back."}
{"text":"They have the best salad in Charlotte and I mean that and their lemonade is to die for I would recommend this place to anyone the only downfall is the parking the parking lot is very small so I always park across the street and just walk over but please get you a Nikki salad and make sure you have cash because that's all the accept wish they didn't because I never carry cash so that's the only inconvenience I have to stop at an atm before I go it's 2018 no one carries cash anymore lol"}
{"text":"This place is close to my job I really would have gotten a better burger at Burger King this is my 3rd time coming here and it will definitely be my last I ordered burger and fries and a side of okra my fries where almost burnt dark and crispy and my okra was cold how the 1st time I got the grill chicken salad it was disgusting to say the least my salad was full of grease. How? The second time was for breakfast I ordered home fries they where still potatoes yes hard as if they just came out the ground. I'm not sure what everyone sees in such a DUMP. NEVER AGAIN I would rather pay more and get at my Desk SMH 
Seriously y'all should really branch out this"}
{"text":"The food is good. I don't care for the grits but that could be me. The porkchops are huge and crispy and tender. There isn't much sit down so taking it to go was better than trying to feed my brood there. I haven't had the salad yet but I heard about before the yelper reviews I read. Next time I pick my kid up early from Northwest I will grab a salad. Breakfast is busy so be prepared but they do keep it moving. I will definitely review again once I get that salad."}
{"text":"The Nikis salad is so good. Enough for 3 people to share. Chicken is flavorful and the salad is loaded with toppings. Absolutely worth 7 bucks. I wish they were open longer so I could catch them off of work."}
{"text":"This is the BEST spot on the Ford!! He has been around for yearrrsssss and respected in the community! He is more than just a business he is a pillar in the community!! CHECK HIM OUT!"}
{"text":"Heard the burgers were good here, so decided to give it a shot. It's cash only and everything seemed to be cook to order. I got a double cheeseburger and it was huge! The taste was just so so and a little dry. Would like to go back and try some of the lunch specials."}
{"text":"The breakfast here is amazing but every time you go up there or call they stop serving it at different times. The customer service is awful, like even the owner is awful but at least the food is pretty good. I ordered a fried shrimp salad and I was kind of annoyed that the lettuce and dressing weren't cold but it is a huge salad. Btw don't order more than 2 drinks they put them in paper baggssss! I spilled that delicious lemonade in my car and I was pissed. Overall it's an okay place.. like I said earlier the breakfast is the best."}
{"text":"EVERY time I'm in Charlotte I come here for breakfast!   It is sooooo good and quick and they ladies there will have you in and out fast!  I definitely recommend this place.  Best breakfast spot in town"}
{"text":"This food is awesome. I had country style steak with rice with gravy with yams and green beans. It was all good. The country style steak was delicious!! I wish the yams had more juice. The sweet tea was amazing! Pretty sure I'm a diabetic now because of it. Mac and cheese is only served on Monday, Wednesday and Friday...

***THIS IS A CASH ONLY RESTAURANT***"}
{"text":"I now know where I can go to get a great gyro while waiting for the summer Greek festival.  I keep hearing about the Niki Salad so I will be bringing my dad back this weekend to try it!  Can't wait!"}
{"text":"I can't attest to much on their menu but HOLY BATMAN! the salads here are a must! The Niki Salad is covered in grilled chicken and is much more than just one meal. The chicken is seasoned very well and this is what makes the salad. The veggies on the salad are always fresh.

And on a recent visit, tried the shrimp salad and this was just as good. Covered in fried shrimp goodness. What would really knock my socks off is if they offered a grilled shrimp salad. 

Call in your orders ahead of time because they can get very, very business. Service is always good and they are very friendly here."}
