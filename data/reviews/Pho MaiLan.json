{"text":"Okay~ not a fan at ALL!!! Meat WAS quetionable.. I don't know what type of meat they use but it is NOT BEEF!!! Not reccomended.. Chinatown has a nice soup u outta go there"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better pho places in the Henderson area. Service is kind of slow but overall the food is awesome and the staff is nice."}
{"text":"Usually good spicy chicken wings but today, it was terrible. Previously tried calling for take-out on my way there but no one answered my call for several minutes.  The chicken wings were dry and overcooked, probably recycled from yesterday. Too bad, used to be one of my favorites for this dish.  Might give it one more chance."}
{"text":"Great Chicken Pho! I've never been disappointed with the quality of their food or their service. My kids love this place too! Pho Mailan has great happy hour food specials. I had never tried Vietnamese food before trying it here...and its got to be some to the best Vietnamese cuisine in Henderson! If you're in the area stop by...you'll be happy that you did:)"}
{"text":"This is my fave Pho place.  The place is nice, clean, not crazy crowded and the staff is great.  My order of the Mailan combo special beef pho is always on point.  Even when I walk in and order I don't ever wait long.  I love their pho!!!"}
{"text":"As Vietnamese American who from central Vietnam, I'm surprise to find good bun bo Hue at Mai Lan.  My kids love the pho here too."}
{"text":"We always go here just for pho and calamari and the food is great, but the service needs work. I've been here many times and since the first time they greet you bring your food and along the way forget about you til the check. Not very attentive.   This visit the lady asked if i would like more water and I said yes. I thought she got busy because she hasn't brought it yet but she was just cutting the garnishes. Please don't ask if I want something when you don't mean to get it."}
{"text":"We dine there fairly often, but they have trouble following directions. For medical reasons, we can't eat jalapenos and similar peppers.. Today I called and ordered two types of banh mi sandwiches for take-out. I specified no jalapenos and had them repeat it back to me on the phone. When I drove over to pick up the sandwiches, the young woman who gave me our order said it was two banh mi with no jalapenos. - Guess what? Got the banh min home and opened them, and they both were loaded with jalapenos. I called to complain and they said to drive back and make an exchange, but I was not up for the round trip. I told them I would visit soon and expect either a full refund or two properly prepared banh mi. We tossed out the ones they gave me because even when the jalapenos are removed, the pepper oils still permeate the sandwich. - Very disappointing, and I will tell you this is not the first time that a menu item we've ordered, even dining in, was not the item that was delivered. You may think I am a chronic complainer, but I am not. It's just that this was the proverbial straw that ...etc, etc."}
{"text":"Excellent Pho, and they are brave enough to use tripe and tendon. Good service, nice modern decor. Prices are amazing, especially for the portions you get. I will return whenever I can."}
{"text":"I think this place is pretty good.  It seems like most of the poor reviews are related to customer service or some kind of language barrier.  The Pho, vermicelli and appetizers are all pretty good.  I go here all the time...."}
{"text":"Poor customer service! Beware when placing an order for pickup! Gal on the phone told me the total would be $7.48 for a banh mi and side of broth..great, be there in 10 minutes! When I picked it up, the cashier said \"oh, my manager DECIDED to raise your total charge to $9.50.\" WTH?!? Who does that? She didn't say she misquoted me on the price, but she literally said, my manager raised your price! Food was sub par.. Drive the extra mile and go to Pho Saigon 8 down Eastern."}
{"text":"Every time I am sick I head here! The pho #2 is my go to, as I am weird about meat and the flank steak is thin cut. However don't be alarmed when you get it to go it is raw, but it cooks in the soup! I tried the shrimp Pho, and it was tasty as well. You get a lot of shrimp. But pho #2 is amazing. Plus when you call for takeout it is ready in like 10 minutes. Overall really great pho, if you live in the area I recommend!"}
{"text":"This is my go to Vietnamese place since its so close to my house.  The staff is probably the most friendly I've ever seen at at Vietnamese restaurant.  Their broth for the pho is very tasty and not overly fishy like some other restaurants in town.  Lemongrass chicken and the sliced pork are good too.  You can tell that they use high quality meats since they aren't overly fatty.    If you go between 3-6 pm you get 20% off too which makes this restaurant an even better deal!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty decent, especially since there's several pho options within several miles of it. Had the standard pho with brisket and rare steak, it was good. Deep beef flavor in the broth, good size bowl full of everything pho should have. Summer (spring) rolls were mediocre, but acceptable. Large, clean dining room. Attentive, courteous staff and free Wi-Fi. Right around the corner from church, so I'm sure I'll go again and won't hesitate to recommend it to others. But overall nothing really that made it standout above the average pho spot."}
{"text":"Growing up with a Vietnamese mom, its hard to find a place that's at good as what Mom makes. Reminds me of her. She was recently in town & I brought her here for lunch. She loved it & couldn't get enough. We both prefer the Cha goi's without the wood ear mushroom & wrapped in rice paper but theirs are good too. When she left Vegas she made me promise to bring her back on her next visit, which I will gladly do.   This time around I tried the beef fried rice. Not what I was expecting, in a good way.  Enormous amounts of thinly sliced marinated beef atop a bed of rice. Mom had the rare beef Pho. Portions were just right.   btw...for those reviews based on a take away order...Pho is best eaten immediately when served, not in a take away order. Its a hot broth soup & meant to be eaten hot...not the next day or 20 minutes after you pick it up & get home."}
{"text":"I come here often and always have a great meal.  the service seems to get better each time and more efficient.  they really want you to enjoy yourself and have a great experience."}
{"text":"Stellar service and very good food. We tried rolls and a sandwich... next time we'll hit their noodles."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here for lunch today after Judd L. sent me a recommendation.The boyfriend wanted to go to Lemongrass because they have banh mi.. but I really wanted to try this place especially after we were able to locate it when we went to Lee's the night before.  It is very nice and clean. They have booths as well as tables. The service was very good and always made sure to fill waters and check if everything was good.  I do feel the the menu does lack some variety. No banh mi, so boyfriend ordered pho instead. I got the rare steak and tendon (as usual!)  and they gave a good amount of beef and tendon. The beef was nice and soft and the tendon was melt in your mouth with a couple exceptions for some chewy peices. I did find the broth to be a little more sour/too citrusy  than I'd like. But besides that it had a nice flavor.   Prices are not too bad either at $6.50 for a small and $7.50 for a large. They did give 20% off our bill for the grand opening.   Personally, Lemongrass is still my favorite in the area but Pho MaiLan is definitely a good alternative as well. More than I can say for Pho Saigon 8, and Pho Little Saigon. Will definitely return in the future.. I wanted to try to bun bo hue that the previous reviewers tried! I saw it.. but decided to go with my normal pho!"}
{"text":"I love com Bo luc lac"}
{"text":"Yummy Pho!  Definitely worth it during happy hour."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Pho restaurants & go to favorite. I always seem to order the P3 & spring rolls. Always delicious! The venue is open, clean & friendly.   It's also great that this place is close to home and away from the Eastern bottleneck of traffic."}
{"text":"Great food and for the most part, great service.  Just had one bad experience with one of the waitresses. She was very rude and was hurrying me when I was ordering to-go.  She kept saying \"yeah yeah yeah\" and was really rushing me.  Mind this,  there was no one behind me at all.  She did not say hello or even said thank you.  She did not even give me a receipt or even asked if I wanted one.  I had to ask if I could get one.  She was very unhappy that day but I'll still come back because the food is great and I usually have an overall great experience here."}
{"text":"I'm just not a fan of the Pho here. My husband and I both thought it was quite bland. We wanted to try it after reading the good reviews but we were not impressed. The service was good and the restaurant was clean but I'm not running back anytime soon. Sorry!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Visited a friend in Henderson and was craving for pho. Friends recommended the restaurant which was perfect"}
{"text":"We're from OC, PHO mainland and this place is on par with the best. The smoked salmon spring rolls were perfect and my pho was awesome. Thing I appreciate the most is that large actually means you get more, not just a bigger bowl! Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times without incident. Not sure if they are under new ownership but the food we ordered was not as good as I remember it. My boyfriend ordered the chicken, beef, and shrimp bowl and was up all night vomiting. It made him very sick. I ordered shrimp and chicken and it was served on a platter soaking in a brown liquid with half cooked noodles COVERED in broccoli, there was so much broccoli. It was the most disgusting concoction I've ever seen. It looked like they literally took every leftover bit of food and piled it on. Needless to say, we will never go back. We'll find another Pho, where the food is edible. This is a total letdown."}
{"text":"Omg! There Pho is delicious highly recommend I visit this restaurant frequently with my co-workers we are obsessed and it doesn't help our obsession that our office is right around the corner from this Gem !!"}
{"text":"I was dying to love this place. I'm a big fan of pho and have eaten it in many cities, including some in Viet Nam. Unfortunately, it was just bland. There wasn't that spark that identifies soup as pho, for me. I don't know what it was missing; I just know it wasn't there. The summer rolls were ok, but, again, missing something (the peanut sauce was awesome, though). The iced tea was very good. The setting and service were really quite good. Now, if they could just add the spark..."}
{"text":"A great Pho place needs only a few things:  1: Great soup. 2: Homemade noodles. 3: Nice people   This place has it all.  Quick, really tasty, and inexpensive.  You won't go wrong coming here.    They do a tremendous takeaway business too- always a steady stream of people picking up on the way up Eastern."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, maybe 6 or 7. It's probably my favorite Vietnamese place. And I still see familiar faces among the staff, managers, (owners maybe?).  We usually start off with some summer rolls, and order a large bowl of pho (noodle soup) with brisket and tendon. The beef short ribs / kalbi are super good, too! Also, the bahn mi pork sandwich... Mmm, yea.   Anyway, before you head out try the che thai, it's a sweet dessert. Coconut milk, crushed ice, lychee, jack fruit, and maybe something else I'm missing. I hate to leave without ordering it.   I noticed they won an award for the best Vietnamese Restaurant from... I don't know LV Weekly or LV RJ, Yelp! maybe? My point is, I'm glad they got the recognition they deserve :)  Thanks so much for all the great food!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've eaten here. Tonight I had the special which was Salmon Pho, thought this was interesting since I've never been anywhere thats offered salmon Pho. It was pretty yummy, I love salmon & I love pho so this was a great combo. Their broth is good, a lil oily but good.   Their service is good as well. I was being difficult in seating because I wanted to see the TV since my team was playing but they were very accommodating.   Restaurant was very clean and I was impressed with their decor, very modern & not your typical pho place. I will def be back."}
{"text":"Very good prices and look at the size of those spring rolls! I don't know pho, but I love bun. Delicious thin sliced pork sandwich in faux baguette. I can't wait to come back and try the spare ribs."}
{"text":"I'm a very picky person when it comes to good food.  This place has it!! I have tried so many Vietnamese Rest here and I love it here.  Good food, great service."}
{"text":"Generous amount and quick service! The pho came hot and fast and was tasty. They had quite a lunch rush. I'd return."}
{"text":"Went for the dinner tonight with my friends...had beef noodle,seafood noodle &chicken bbq.., food was ok but the service was horrible.   No waitresses came for check on see if we need anything else besides food.. I don't think will be back there any soon!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say after eating at virtually every Vietnamese restaurant in town Pho Milan is one of the worst! Ingredients are usually not fresh, broth is bland and the service is mediocore. I've tried to support the place because its close to home, but no more."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I have a particular love for Hanoi Ca, otherwise known as Hanoi style fish preparation (grilled with dill and onions).  Not easy to find in most Vietnamese restaurants.  As a non Asian with a very western taste who likes most Vietnamese food as long as it is not too traditional (ie uses shrimp paste), I look for these types of Vietnamese restaurants who have westernized their menu.    We had our family reunion there, with lots of local and non local Vietnamese and myself.  We all left full and very happy with our meals.  My wife really likes Bun Bo Hue, which is also not often  well prepared, but here, she was delighted to find it very authentic.  Their combination pho made my mother in law very happy.  The price was very reasonable and the quantities were generous.  The tables are designed for large family gatherings, but they have tables for small groups as well.  The service was good and the place was very clean, something also rare to find in many restaurants.  Hope that this place considers serving Banh Xeo, Vietnamese Crepe, in the future."}
{"text":"Great spicy pork sandwiches, wings, and Pho Very Clean Place Prices are great!!!!"}
{"text":"Make sure you give them the amount you wanna give coz you're not getting your change back."}
{"text":"The c11 was a good dish when I first got it but this time I got it and the bowl wasn't hot enough the onions were still raw but the beef was good which sorta made up for it."}
{"text":"Although the food is 3.5 out of 5. I give them 2 stars. Because how dry their service is every time I go there. 04/09/16, I came in at 8:07pm (they close at 9) I was told that they were closed because no soup left. Kinda weird that their sign was still blinking \"open\". Starting to hate this place because of their service."}
{"text":"I have been to this place for 3 times and now Pho MaiLan is where I recommend if you are craving for pho, spring rolls, and egg rolls. The all items were what I ordered every visit and I thought that the taste of all items has consistency as I was expecting at the 3rd visit.  I've tried other 2 pho restaurants, but I liked this place much better because I really liked the flavor of the broth and the taste of the egg rolls.  The service was pretty good too. One waitress was very friendly and nice when we requested some things we need. That's one of what I had good impression about this restaurant at the 3rd visit and it brought me to write a review. I think the service is also important and a part of how we can enjoy the food.   That day the only thing I didn't like much was \"the beef stew with French bread\". I ordered it my first time as it looked so good to me looking at the picture of the menu, but when it was brought it up to me, unfortunately it wasn't like at all the one I was expecting from the menu.  Oh well, I don't order it next time and just stick to what I always order here."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite Pho eateries in Henderson. I've tried several surrounding ones and Pho Mailan has won me over. Servers are friendly, free wifi, atmosphere is awesome, and their food is delicious. Must try their spring rolls, egg rolls, and of course their pho! Thanks Pho Mailan for always fulfilling my pho cravings!"}
{"text":"I love their Thai iced tea with grass jelly. It's not overly sweet like I've had in the past. It's just right, to my liking. Chicken Satay is always a fave and so is the Chicken Ph with egg noodle. What I will say is that the shrimp fried rice was not to my liking.   Overall, I have absolutely no complaints about the service, very sweet. I've ordered take out from Ph Mailan as well and my order is always complete."}
{"text":"Just had dinner with my family. When we first came in, the place looks nice unlike other Vietnamese restaurants, not too crowded but service was horrible. Ordered soup first and appetizer but felt too rushed. Finally, some of the main meal arrived except mine. Waited and waited and finally asked the waiter who said I didn't order but 3 main meal. Told him to forget about it. I lost my appetite after waiting for a while. Then few minutes later the waiter came back and said here is your order who told me a few mins ago that I didn't have an order. I am tired of going to Vietnamese restaurants who has little or no customer care at all. Will never go back nor recommend this place.    Ester"}
{"text":"Came here for pho. Out of rice noodles at a Vietnamese restaurant? Got the egg noodles. Pho comes out 30 min later. Yes 30 minutes. Barely any meat. Not worth"}
{"text":"It's clean, and the staff are quick and friendly.   I ordered the pho tai. It was decent but I would go to another pho place before I came back to this one."}
{"text":"Love the food! My business partner n I go there twice a week. Waitresses are very nice n sweet :) see ya soon!"}
{"text":"Food are great!  spacious and clean restaurant. Servers and the manager were very kind and friendly too."}
{"text":"Great food, great price, great service.  This place is new, clean, and comfortable.  Rice noodle bowl with bbq pork and spring rolls was terrific.  Beef pho combo was also very good.  A good spot for a quick casual lunch."}
{"text":"I love coming here. Tonight was a really good night , not only did I get fast service and great food. My dearest friend Philip taught me how to use \" chop sticks \" ! Now who takes the time out to do that?? Philip does ,that's who! Not only did he do that he also mix my pho for me ! This by far had been the best restaurant experience I have ever had! This guy loves what he does and it genuinely shows. :-D  I had pho while I waited for my 3 Bahn mi sandwiches were being prepared. The music was lovely and so was the night and the weather for a nice bowl of pho."}
{"text":"Happy hour is only $5 for pho, and the broth is really good. It's clean, people are nice, and it's really cheap."}
{"text":"I come here quite frequently. The staff,the service ,the food is spot on every time! Keep up the great work;)"}
{"text":"I am very impressed with this place. Had the Bun Bo Hue (Bun Bo Mailan as they call it here) and I wasn't disappointed! All good quality ingredients, no corners cut and most importantly, the soup stock was perfect.   A pleasant surprise is that they offer you Banana Blossom as part of the vegetables to dunk in your soup, I don't know anywhere that offers this and its one of the traditional must have ingredients.  The restaurant itself is nice and spacious, very clean and nice positive colours. The service was very good, didn't have to ask for a refill on drinks once.  I would defo go back, next time to try some Pho"}
{"text":"We're not from here but stumbled upon this place while looking for somewhere to eat dinner at. I love Vietnamese food, and this place did not disappoint. I typically get the bun (noodle) dishes and enjoyed it very much. We came back again tonight, two days later."}
{"text":"Good. Was in the general area and in a pho mood, and chose this one because of four Yelp stars. Right on target; a solid four. We ordered P2 and B15 and the bill was under $30 including tax and tip (can't hate that). Service was very good. Wouldn't hesitate to go back, if we are hungry in Henderson."}
{"text":"Actually ate here last week!! Delicious!! I am a Pho nut!! We ordered several dishes a shrimp fried rice, beef w/noodles, pho and several different spring and egg rolls. Now I will say I have had better pho broth and egg rolls. However this place hit the spot and was still delicious overall! To top it off the employees, especially the cashier were super sweet and friendly! I'm so glad to have found a pho place close to home!"}
{"text":"Service was not so good tonight. We had to ask for utensils after they served our food. I ordered pho with tendon and got one lousy piece. When I asked for a few more pieces, it finally came but was not cooked all the way and was cold in the middle. We had to ask for things at least 4 times that should have been provided in the first place."}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  Service, also excellent.  I would go back if there weren't 5 other excellent pho places between my house and it.  My only complaint was that they took away my chopsticks and gave me a fork and knife when I ordered a rice dish.  I don't know if they were assuming that I didn't know how to use the chopsticks for a rice dish or if I would just need a fork and knife, but it felt very presumptuous.  I'd rather use the chopsticks.  But, minor complaint.  It was excellent other than that.  You should go."}
{"text":"Amazing.  The food was great but the service was even better.   I just found my new favorite spot.  Me and Pho Mailan have just became friends."}
{"text":"P2 and you're in pho heaven. They don't rush you out. Toddlers do get place in the corner table but as a parent I can appreciate that"}
{"text":"My favorite Vietnamese resturant in town. Food is awesome and the staff is so friendly! Very clean Resturant to. High recommend."}
{"text":"I will not eat Pho anywhere else after discovering this place! My husband and I are regulars and are always treated with so much respect. They are so sweet to our son and always have our food out within minutes of us sitting down. Best service, best staff, and best food"}
{"text":"I decided to try a new Pho location other than Jenni Pho. This one had good reviews and I just so happen to be on this side of town. It was really busy which is always a good sign. However, the pho tai nam lacked a lot of flavor. The broth needs more spices and flavor to it. I had to add a lot of extra items to the pho that I usually don't add to get some type of flavor that was digestible. I definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Best pho place in the valley I should say. Everything is just great. I always get the all meat pho, P1. I also love their goi cuon and pork and shrimp salad."}
{"text":"I come here often for lunch. Its a very clean and friendly restaurant. Today I ordered vermicelli noodles with beef instead of pork w/egg rolls. It was delicious as always. I ordered a dessert to go. It had coconut juice, jackfruit, jelly, and other fruits w/shaved ice. Very refreshing!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but service was poor, inconsistent, and rude. We dined in, ate pho and waited for happy hour. We ordered happy hour to go, but they would not let us take it to go. They said that happy hour was dine in only and that there was a sign outside that stated this. We investigated the whole restaurant and there was nothing that said happy hour was only for dine in. Restaurant was really slow and when we spoke to the owner they were rude and gave hand negative hand gestures cueing that they were annoyed by us. I like the food, but I will never again come to this place."}
{"text":"Decent service. Somewhat dirty facility. Restroom was grimy. Meats were a little too salty for my taste but a smoker might love this place. Too much star anise in broth. Again, my preference, not bad flavor, just not my preference. Portions were generous and good price to food value. I wish I liked their interpretations of Vietnamese better but I think I'll be taking the drive to Spring Mountain when I need my pho fix."}
{"text":"I get stuck in other parts of the city, but I still make the drive to the best Pho' and service in the area"}
{"text":"Nice, clean environment and you won't have to wait to be seated. Servers aren't the best I've had, but the food is great if your craving Vietnamese food. I to-go the B1 combination for home and it's flavorful. As for Pho, the P1 special combination is a personal favorite. If you like Vietnamese food, Pho Mailan is a great option."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend when to have dinner here hoping that it be good we sat down and the restraunt stunk like crazy so bad we almost left. Our food we ordered wasnt that great  I was expecting  something better Rather just drive a little bit further  for a better pho restraunt"}
{"text":"It was hot outside and when you get in here it was as hot as well! We were sweating!   The coconut juice i ordered is not fresh, tasted odd!   Not much vegetables and meat! Though meat was tasty  Wont come back!"}
{"text":"I am so excited that the wife and I decided to try this place!   We decided to give it a try 3 weeks ago and we have been back twice since. The food is delicious, the waiter gives great suggestions and has a great sense of humor. The decor is clean and nicer than the other places in town. We have tried a few different items from the menu and have loved each one"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write a review for Pho Mai Lan for awhile, but did not have a yelp account.  Then I realized, I use yelp all the time to find restaurants, that it is now time to contribute.  So, I've been going to Pho Mai Lan since it opened almost 2 years ago.  I would say for Vegas, this is up there with the best Pho in town.  I always order #6, beef, meatballs, and tendons.  They have a consistent fresh flavor.  This is the cleanest pho restaurant I've ever been to, and the vegetables are fresh everyday.  This beats driving to spring mountain and I think the quality and taste is just as good if not better."}
{"text":"The store had some hiccups. With phones which bothered me a bit but I love coming here because they give me good friendly service.  And the foods pretty good.  I wish they would give a little more but it's still filling.  The broth is pretty clean and tasteful."}
{"text":"If I could give -1 I would . Although if you love PHO it's great. I ordered salmon taste like cardboard. They didn't seem to care.Service was terrible a big group of like 20 came in and got all there attention...Place really f_ c_ k_ ing sucks. Rather have bad food and good service but not both Bad service and bad food"}
{"text":"Worse service ever! Heard all the hype about how great this place is. They even have a huge banner out front that said it was voted best Vietnamese restaurant. However, when we entered we waited for 15 min to be seated even though there were 9 tables open, granted most were dirty but it took another 5 minutes for someone to actually clean one of the tables up and then sit us. Then we waited another ten minutes before someone came to take our order. When we ordered beef pho, the waiter then proceeded to tell us they were out of beef pho and only had chicken pho. We were there during lunch hour on a Friday. How do you run out of your most favored menu item during a weekend lunch hour? Terrible service. Completely disappointed. We left and tried a pho place down the street."}
{"text":"The Pho here is average. They have an afternoon happy hour if you need to save a few bucks. There are better Pho places in the city but as far as Henderson area, this will be your best bet. I usually get an order of spring rolls and either a vermicelli dish or the rare steak Pho."}
{"text":"We came here to try their foods, and found very dissatisfied. 1) We ordered their Pho, and asked for slices of lemon to  be put into our ice water, to illiminate it's chlorine smell, also to squeez into the soup. They said that they do not have it. How can a Vietnamese restaurant does not have lemon for their customer? 2) the Pho came like a luke warm water, and the beef was overcooked. 3) we ordered BBQ chicken and egg rolls on the top of rice. Their egg rolls were ok, but, the BBQ chicken was darker and burnt. On a whole, their foods, from our experiences, are not qualified to be called as VIETNAMESE foods"}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I am always seated immediately. The service is super friendly, and I've never had a bad experience. I come here every week for the shrimp pho and fried egg rolls.  :) My boyfriend is always daring, and gets something new almost every time. He has never not liked anything. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is usually good but today not so good! Order Pho' and I can say literally swimming in fat oil. My mouth feels like it has so much grease that a cup of water and hot tea cannot take away. On a positive note the service is great and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"It was quick and clean with friendly service. I've had better Vietnamese at other local places. Reasonably priced for lunch. Spent $22 for 2 ppl. I had the Combo Vermicelli Bowl."}
{"text":"Overall really solid pho. I've had some appetizers here and none have blown my socks off, but the pho is super tasty. Service is decent and the restaurant is nice and clean - definitely a good go-to spot."}
{"text":"Stopped by here a couple weeks ago for a late lunch. The place is clean and has a tv on the wall. I'm not sure what channel it was on, but it was that program where they show you the process of making something in a factory. We caught it from the middle to the end. It turned out to be a garage door. I thought that it was pretty entertaining.   I had the Pho Tai Sach w/my beef on the side. The veggies were fresh. The broth was good. The size of the bowl was decent. The beef was fresh and there was a good amount.  I will give them another try next time I'm in the neighborhood.  Thanks for lunch LiLy D!"}
{"text":"Terrible! I feel like Pho is tough to mess up but they did! The meat was mediocre at best. We also ordered teriyaki beef and that was really fatty. The meats all together we're really low quality."}
{"text":"Well...I will admit that Pho is NOT a FAV of mine. I know this place was voted Best in Henderson, and my visit did nothing to change my mind OR TASTEBUDS!! BLEH---       the chic satay w/ peanut sauce.....my comment \"THAT'S CHICKEN? I've never seen chicken that looks like that!\" Tasted my husband's (he thinks this place is the Bomb!) Pho Beef Soup w/ seafood...... Also just not my thing....Just Ikky~ our server was young, & she didn't understand us, nor we her.   Might I try it again??? I can't imagine why, however I have learned Never to say Never~"}
{"text":"Pho-licious!  I keeps it real and stick with the chicken."}
{"text":"For a place with the name Pho in it you would think the Pho would be awesome but its really not. Its majorly lacking in flavor. It almost tastes like its just beef broth with no Pho spices!!! In fact I think the broth is not authentic at all it does taste like its can beef broth.  I was hoping it was good because they are right across the street from me and sometimes i'm just too lazy and tired to spend 8 hours making my own Pho, but I was very disappointed. Not to mention the seafood pho is majorly lacking in good quality squid and the scallops are a joke their pea sized!!! why even put it in there then?! if I want good Pho I have to drive down to Pho Saigon 8 over in the Chuck E Cheese complex. In addition this place is majorly over priced!!! I have never had to pay $10 for Pho and its not even good!!! That's ridiculous!!! this place is way to over priced. Driving down to Pho Saigon 8 will save you almost $3 per person!!! yeah I have to say the price is just way over the top for being a simple Vietnamese place. If you are familiar with Vietnamese food the ingredients are not expensive at all. I will not be coming back here, I will make the small extra drive to save money and have better Pho."}
{"text":"This place is by pho the best pho I've ever had it's unphogettable all joking aside. Great place I will pho sure comeback to this place.Only a phocking idiot would pass this place up.All I have say is pho get about it this place is awesome.The prices are phocking shocking very well priced for the quality and amount food.              PHO LIFE"}
{"text":"The pho here is delicious, but it doesn't excuse the sanitation here.  I've gotten sick here twice and my son got hand foot disease here.  Maybe I didn't wipe the seat down well enough? But why should I be wiping EVERYTHING down? That's just ridiculous.  The service here is also terrible, you can barely flag anyone down and when you do get a hold of someone, it takes a good minute for them to get it for you regardless of how busy the place is.  I will not continue going to this place and honestly I don't suggest anyone should either. #sorrynotsorry"}
{"text":"It was a very satisfied dish. I like the egg taquitos. Pretty good value for meal I will go again definitely."}
{"text":"I came here on a kinda whim 'cause the boyfriend was sick, and I thought he'd want some good pho to make him feel a bit better. The ladies greeted me right away, and since I already knew that I wanted pho with beef, they gave me a recommendation. Ended up ordering 1 small and 1 large of the Pho Dac Biet to go, and I got the food within 10 minutes.  LOL. Ladies, please remember to charge your customers that order to go before handing them the food. If I wasn't an honest person, I would've walked out without paying.  Anyway, I think I spent about $22, including tip.  I'll be sure to eat in as a different and future experience."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance,fast service.Food here are ok.My friend and I ordered Pho Tai/pho Tai Chin.I ordered Pho Chay(Vegetable) and fried egg rolls(Cha goi).The food were ok not bad but not outstanding.However,I am not sure whether I will come back to this place again since there are better Pho places in the area."}
{"text":"I am so excited!  They opened this Vietnamese restaurant like 4 minutes from my house.  Yay!!! My wife and I just returned from having dinner there.  We both ordered the MaiLan special - Bun Bo Hue.  Man, it was awesome!  There was a great deal of meat in it and it was spicy as heck.  I was sweating bullets.  But, it was SOOO good.  I downed my Thai Tea and drank like 3 glasses of water.   As for atmosphere, very casual.  The restaurant is quite open and clean.  It has a calming effect.  We didn't care too much for the pictures ~ for some reason, they have a cyclist picture in an Asian restaurant.  Figure that they would have more of an Asian theme.  But, really, we weren't there for the pictures.   As for the service, it is a family run operation and they really take care of you.  And, yes, thank god, they actually talk to you and ask you how was your experience.  Customer Service is something that is usually lacking in a lot of Viet restaurant (i.e. Pho Saigon 8 - yuck).    We highly recommend this place.  And, we definitely would be back to Pho Mailan... Yay!!!"}
{"text":"I've tried so hard to like this place since it's the closest pho place to go to for me. It's been a disappointment the 5 tiimes I've gone."}
{"text":"The first time I went here, the pho was ok. One month later, they really improved the soup's flavor and I would tell anyone who wanted pho to come here."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite Pho place! They use very fresh ingredients and their food has a great flavor. They have a happy hour menu with various food selections from 3-5 on weekdays!"}
{"text":"I love the variety of appetizer selections they have here. It's pretty vegetarian friendly too. Ordered  fried vegetarian egg rolls and the meatball pho.  The broth of their pho is really flavorful and fragrant. It comes with fresh mint leaves so you can pluck off and add to your liking. Egg rolls were pretty good too, filled with the thin clear noodles and veggies plus lettuce so you can wrap the egg roll like a lettuce wrap. I'm assuming that's what your supposed to do.  Service is always great. I was lingering there longer than usual and catching up with a friend and our server was really sweet and never gave us the stink eye to leave.  Oh and the iced green tea is actually steeped from tea leaves and not those ground up teabags. Winning!"}
{"text":"It was not until I was seated with my hot plate of pho in front of me that I noticed the glaring \"C\" grade displayed in a semi conspicuous location. I havIe to admit that seeing the grade had a negative impact on my overall experience.  From the outside the place is spacious, modern and appears clean. The service is friendly and to the point. They are located up Eastern near the Anthem area. I had their No 1 combo while my husband opted for Vermecelli. The broth was fine - it was savory with a decent amount of flavor. They skimped on the meat that's for sure.  I really did not find it mind blowing enough to return after their \"C\" grade slip up. I had their pho once before and it was \"fine\" enough to return, but this was before the grade. As I mentioned before, the broth is solid but not mind blowing nor the best in town by any stretch. I think it will do well with the Anthem clientele -- just get the grade under control! Had it not been for the grade issue I would say this is a solid 3.5 joint."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves good food, specially their spicy beef noodle soup. I am only giving it 3 stars because I once ordered a fresh spring roll for pick up after work, and when I got home and opened the box, they roll was dry and have week old lettuce, browning on the edges, very dry, well stored pork and shrimp stuffs. In short, it was awful. But I dont think it deserves a 1 star. They do serve some good hot noodle soups.  Given a choice between this resto or Saigon 8 on Eastern and 215- I would go to Saigon 8."}
{"text":"Pho is always my go to meal, especially when it's a little chilly and gloomy out--it just screams pho weather. :)   I love coming to this place for my pho cravings mainly because of the generous serving of meat that comes in a small bowl and the super tasty and tangy broth. The broth is what makes it or breaks it for me when it comes to pho and I can honestly say that Pho Mai Lan, does their broth RIGHT! I barely have to put any hoisin or limes to get it to my liking.   Another thing that's a must have item on their menu is their Vietnamese style coffee. I am literally fueled by coffee alone so I take it pretty seriously lol ¯\_(?)_/¯ it's brewed traditionally and comes with the right amount of sweetened condensed milk.   A great time to come here is definitely during lunch because their regular beef pho and chicken pho bowls are just $5.00!  With the temperature slowly decreasing, pho weather is everyday, So head on down to Anthem and give this gem of a place a try! :)"}
{"text":"The food was ok and the service was not great! They were very stingy compared to other Pho places we've been to. They gave us one small plate for 3 bowls of soup. The one thing one girl was up on was our water refills."}
{"text":"Idk how this place has so many reviews and still has 4 stars. I ordered the seafood pho. It was bland and very average. They charged extra for seafood, then they wanted to charge extra for extra broth. I was like wtf? It's flavored water. Also waitresses weren't very nice or accommodating. Have had a lot of pho in my time and the all around food and service ranks as one of the worst."}
{"text":"I was excited to see this location had opened up since it is so close to my house. I finally stopped by with my mom one day. It was not very crowded but it took a while for us to be seated and we just awkwardly stood there. We were seated and it still took a while before anyone came to take our drink order. I probably would have left if I weren't really craving it. The food was all right. Wasn't the best or worst I've had. But I won't be going bacl"}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with this place.  Been going to a ramen place down the street for a while and always leave full and happy....   came here after hearing all the hype about pho and wasnt happy.  i totally would pick ramen over pho any day!!!!  the egg rolls were very good and that was the only good thing about the dinner!"}
{"text":"Best pho in Las Vegas.  This place has become our favorite in Las Vegas. We have always have a good experience.  I usually do beef & flank pho and a side order of summer rolls.   Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"It is 4 star because I think they deserve it . Also I'm not a fan of the modern decor but I will say this it is clean very clean with good service and a good pho. Also the pricing is what it is probably because off the location being st the mouth of anthem.  There are just so many pho places on eastern I think they need to step up the flavor a bit.  One good note is opening at 10 am as sometimes we do pho for Sunday breakfast.  Been here many many times and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Our first time at this place and we are very satisfied with the food, the cleanliness of the place & most of all the service.   When we sat down someone was taking our drink order in less that a minute.  The host said is very polite & said Thank you before leaving our table to deliver our order.  My friend & I ordered a large bowl of Pho to share and the host, named T, actually scooped our soup into our individual bowls. That to me, is exceptional.  The food is delicious and the price of it is very reasonable. Worth every penny.  We will go back! Most def!!!!"}
{"text":"Pho Mailan is a good restaurant with good service. I always get the Summer Rolls and Pho Meatball which both have great flavor. I usually go in on a Sunday evening as they have the football game on a flat screen. Glad there is one near home now. I will definitly be back"}
{"text":"Nice, clean family run business. Very nice ambience, super friendly staff and the best part-food is fresh and delicious! Summer rolls are huge and freshly made, rice bowl dishes just the right size, and the shrimp fried rice-so light and yummy with grilled medium shrimp (not those tiny ones normally used). Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The service food and atmosphere were \"slightly\" above par when this place first opend. However, after having a poor experience 6 months ago, we decided not to return until last week. Upon our return, the food server was extremely unwelcoming and appeared to be in a hurry as we were trying to place our order. We were apologized to by another staff member who really did not know what they were apologizing for. We asked for the manager, but he or she was unavailable. Will NEVER return........"}
{"text":"$5 for chicken Pho!! You betcha. It was great as well. I'll definitely be coming back. Friendly staff that kept my water glass full."}
{"text":"I came here for the happy hour special. I was pretty impressed. I had the combination Pho and it was really good. The broth had a little more flavor than other Pho places and it didn't taste like just cilantro. For people who like spicy I recommend putting in the jalapenos they serve with some chili garlic sauce.  I also had some kind of Pork sandwich. I forgot the name. But it was also good. It was served on a crusty french baguette with cucumber slices and some sore of carrot/cabbage slaw mix. The pork itself had a sweet sauce around it, somewhat like General Tsos or Sesame chicken.   Good service and the place was extra clean. I will be returning.  Update.  I've made this place my goto spot for Pho. After eating at at least 5 other Pho places, Pho Mailan easily has the best. It's super clean, the service is extremely friendly and the food is very very good. The happy hour special is great. During the week from 3-5pm they have 5 dollar bowls of Pho, and 3 dollar sandwiches. What a steal!  My only problem with this place is that it's only open til 9pm, and since I work odd hours if i get the itch for Pho I have to travel to Spring Mountain and eat sub par alternatives in the middle of the night. I wish they we're open late!!!  I've eaten at Pho Mailan like once every two weeks for the past 4 months and never have had one complaint."}
{"text":"Great first experience for new neighborhood pho place.  I tried the pho thai, shrimp + sugar cane lettuce wraps and they were both great."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in Henderson, don't have to drive to China town to get my Asian food fixed . Price is reasonable, portion is adequate to huge. Place is simple and look like any type of Asian restaurant in China Town. Quick services . Ordered the summer spring rolls, cold noodles with stir fry beef( bun bo xao) pho special& three beans drink. Reason for 3 stars because hubby didn't like his pho much, he stated it is too bland, there was no basil  leaves to go along in the pho. Again there was no mints leaves in the cold noodles or the spring rolls . The bean wasn't soft and came with jello like strips instead of the chewy jelly kind that you usually get in a true typical Vietnamese restaurant. Meat was also a little tough but they do give you plenty"}
{"text":"Just picked up some pho tai from there on the way home. Broth so cool beef wouldn't cook. If you want some crappy cold pho give them a shot!"}
{"text":"Agree with the yelpers who say this is just an okay pho place. We come often because it's close to home and my hubby likes it (not a foodie like me). I have yet to find great pho in Vegas like when we lived in San Diego almost 30 years ago."}
{"text":"Pho is great here and excellent service. Happy hr is legit and I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Best Pho in town for a great price. The summer rolls are great too!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has good reviews..I think maybe because there isn't another good pho place that's close by..but this place is not good! I've tried it a few times and my opinion still hasn't changed, food is blah! Do yourself a favor and drive down Eastern a little bit for better options!"}
{"text":"Delicious pho, with many varieties to sample.  Fresh, hot and tasty.  Generous quantity of beef (if you like that in your pho).  Very friendly staff and low key but clean surroundings.  Very good prices, easy in and out, quick and plenty of parking.   The only (minor) complaint is sometimes the noodles are not thoroughly cooked - I mean just a few of them, not the whole bowl.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We have ordered take out two times now. The service has always been great and the pho is delicious. Definite must if you are looking for delicious pho!"}
{"text":"This place always hits the spot. Their food has never been anything less than amazing no matter what we order (although the P7 and C5 seem to be our go to favorites). The staff is always friendly and the restaurant is always clean. This will always be a go to spot for pho-tastic Vietnamese food (excuse the pun)"}
{"text":"I've had lunch and dinner here a few times before but it seems that the service, quality, and taste of the food has gotten worse. The sign outside as Voted #1 in Vegas is BOGUS and no longer an accurate description of this restaurant. The food is super salty. Food is mediocre at best!! The restaurant is dirty. The utensils are very old and could use a good polish and a good scrub. The service was awful. VERY, VERY, VERY slow and RUDE waitress. The waitress kept forgetting our table and the restaurant was not busy at all. Had to ask for water twice and the waitress forgot to put the order in the kitchen. We waited and watched while two other tables were served their food. The only time the waitress came back to our table is to give the check and she hovered and stood over me while I took the money out of my wallet. RIDICULOUS. I do not recommend this restaurant at all. There are plenty of other Vietnamese restaurant down on Eastern worth checking out."}
{"text":"Ah! First time here! Great menu! Busy place! Ceiling tiles need to be replaced! Dusty air vents too! Food splashes on the walls! Initially taken to a dirty table! Now out of chicken broth? I will give them my free inspector review!"}
{"text":"Just ate there a few minutes ago..my son and I was so famished, excited to eating at Pho Milan. I ordered P7 small, as we got our food..I hand picked my basil leaves all the time and then something moved in my bowl...it was a green LITTLE WORM wiggling...Yuk!! I ask the waitress to give me a new one, she even got grosse out. I was surprised they did not comp the meal.We  don't know if it's still the same owner but the quality of food is not the same. The beans sprouts are a little brown. We always thought they have a great food. Now I don't know if we'll be back again.  It's sad and the service is terrible. I gave 1 star just because but it needs to improve quality and service."}
{"text":"MSG soup. Large pho  is not very large compare other restaurant. Just large bowl with lots of soup and little content. Might as well order the small.  Their vegetables are not fresh. Checkout the dark spot and withering basil served with their pho. Yuck!  There is catch on their happy hour 20% off. It is only on their small pho."}
{"text":"My standard for Vietnamese food maybe a little high given the fact that I lived in SoCal about a 20 minute drive from Westminster/Little Saigon.  While the service here is very good for an asian restaurant, and the restaurant itself is clean and modern compared to most vietnamese restaurants, the food was just OK. I ordered the Grilled Pork and it was too fatty and salty (even for me who likes to eat salty) :-("}
{"text":"Two Years Later, and my Weekly Visit to MaiLan is Still the Same, Awesome!  I always get the All White Chicken Meat Chicken Broth Pho and add Tai (Filet Steak) to it, with extra noodles, Best in USA. Sometimes I get a side Pork Chop, which is so good I feel like I'm eating Filet Mignon sometimes!  My Vietnamese counterpart changes up with a variety of orders, which says a lot about the authentic quality of the Restaurant!"}
{"text":"This happens every time my husband is sick with a cold. We have to find a decent Pho place close to the house so I can pick up the body and mind healing soup, to cure whatever ails him. I came across Pho MaiLan. The broth is very good, not as much basil as I like to be served but the waiters were very nice and brought extra. I always order Meatball Pho with extra meatballs. If you cannot let your broth and meatballs stand alone then you don't have good pho. The meatballs are very well balanced and had a great texture. I love it when I order extra and I get extra! They pass my test and made my husband feel very good. To top it off they serve Three Color Bean Dessert, if you have never had this, it is a great culinary experience. It consists of a white bean sweetened with condensed milk, a sweet red bean, and a rice jelly of some kind, usually green and cut into strips with a wavy slicer. Layered like a trifle and topped with coconut milk and shaved ice. It is spectacular and so refreshing and fun to eat. They make a very good one here. I recommend trying it if you feel adventurous."}
{"text":"Went here \"late\" the other night and had some pho.  The staff were super kind and willing to answer my date's questions about pho.  I had the sausage roll appetizer and pho with meatballs, round eye, and brisket.  The appetizer was just alright.  It had alright flavor but was dry.  I suppose I could've used more of the sauce but I am not the biggest fan of peanut sauce so I just used soy sauce and lime juice which seemed to do the trick.  The pho itself was tasty but there wasn't anything too special about it.  It wasn't amazing and it definitely wasn't bad.  Maybe I'm just not a pho guy but for what it was, I enjoyed it and had no complaints.  Go ahead and give it a try yourself!"}
{"text":"First time sitting down here to eat, I would usually stop in for take out. I was very happy I stayed in and ate here.  I ordered the large P.3 Pho tai chin, it was delicious! The meat was very tender and melted in my mouth. I feel like the large was too much food for me, I should have ordered the small. The veggies that they brought out for us were very fresh and clean!   The waiting staff were all very friendly and kind, they went out of the way to make sure we were taken care of and it really made me feel happy. I would totally recommend trying this place out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I used to like this place and went a lot, but I stopped going when there was a big piece of plastic mixed in my soup.  I guess they were just in too much of a hurry to remove it.  I actually saw another reviewer say the same thing before it ever happened to me.  I guess I didn't believe him or want to until it happened to me too.  I drive a little farther down the hill now to go to one of the 3 pho places down by the 215.  The Pho Mailan broth was a little bland anyway compared to the others, but I had been willing to overlook that due to the convenient location until the plastic incident happened."}
{"text":"had the pho with tendon, brisket, and beef balls....YUMMO! Ordered their HUGE sandwiches to go! Just in case i get a little hungry later. Service was consistent and food was amazing!"}
{"text":"We stopped by on a Sunday evening for dinner. They were moderately busy, but there were plenty of open tables, so we were seated right away.  The decor and ambience is comfortable, friendly and clean. There isn't any of the usual Vietnamese restaurant smell upon walking in. The service is very friendly and attentive.  The food tastes very good. I would say they are above average in terms of taste. You definitely get good value for your money.  Overall, if you're in the mood for some pho or other Vietnamese-styled food, this place will make you happy. If I could give this place a 4.5, I would."}
{"text":"The place looks cute. When it comes down to the food my boyfriend and i got the eggrolls, soup w ribeye steak, and marinated beef plate. eggrolls weren't that great it was ok. the soup kind of tasted weird but the marinated beef plate was really good served a lot of fat though. I would come again for the marinated beef plate. they brought out the food in a timely manner. service was great."}
{"text":"Normally on the weekends I wouldn't schlep all the way to Henderson for my Vietnamese/Pho fix unless I'm going there during the week from the office.    But on a lazy Saturday afternoon, I was extended an invitation for the official official grand opening of Pho MaiLan with 20% off the meal.  Noodle Houses are not known for ambiance but based on first impression upon arrival, the vibe inside has a fun and relaxing interior.  Me and Mr. UK David C. ordered the Large Bun Bo MaiLan (their version of Bun Bo Hue) AKA (MaiLan spicy beef and pork noodle soup). By default, MaiLan doesn't have the congealed pig blood like a traditional BBH, but I actually prefer it without it. They loaded my bowl with a decent portion of protein which I always appreciate when I eat a bowl of noodle soup.  I put in my veggies (a sprinkling of bean sprouts and they have banana blossoms which I'm sure you won't find in many shop in the US, let alone Vegas).  A nice squeeze of some lime in my eye and in the soup of course.    Hell, I even managed to forget the sting of lime juice burning my eyeball for several minutes while I devoured my bowl of deliciousness.  The broth was nice with the right amount of spiciness that is enjoyable and very flavorful. You can really tell that they use good quality ingredients and prepare everything very well.  For a busy grand opening, the service was consistent and attentive to our needs and I never had to ask them to refill my glass of water.  I will have to try the Pho Dac Biet (Combination Special) and Cha Gio (Crispy Spring Rolls) next time to really round out this review.  We may have a potential new contender for favorite Bun Bo Hue but certainly room for improvement for a future UYE or lunch visit.  It will mos def be in the my lunch rotation going forward pho shizzle!"}
{"text":"I love this place -convenient location and great food! If you are looking for great Vietnamese in Henderson, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in town for PHO. Excellent service, good location, good prices, and the happy hour from 3-5 daily is a great bonus. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"The Spring Rolls are amazing!!  This a really great Vietnamese restaurant.  Not just Pho.  All sorts of wonderful things!  The service was very attentive and the menu creative and lovely.  The ingredients were super fresh and I just loved it.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I found this hidden gem about 6 months ago. Just as good as any of the spots on spring mountain. Food is always hot and fresh. Service is friendly and fast. We eat here 1-2 times per week. Family owned and operated. I have not once been disappointed. Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"The pho here is very good. Soup is flavorful and clean. Chicken satay is ok but a little bit dry."}
{"text":"new place ... very clean good service ... waitress is hard to understand english ... food was good as well ... i have tried the rice dish and pho portions on smaller side but was very tasty."}
{"text":"My visit here last night was not so great.   I came here for some quick dinner. No one came up to me as I waited in the front to be seated. Instead, a teenage employee in the back waited for me to look at him and pointed to a booth where I could sit. A lot of the workers there looked young and they were not attentive at all.   The pho tasted good, but it smelled horrible. It smelled just like a pet store! It was hard for me to eat it because of the stench and I'm surprised that I never got sick from it last night or this morning. Also, they gave me my pho without chopsticks or a spoon. I tried looking for a waiter so I could ask for one, but again, they are all inattentive. I had to get up from my seat and ask for one since all of the employees were talking amongst themselves in a corner of the restaurant.   I honestly did not give a tip because it felt like I was rushed out of there (it was not busy at all) and I was not paid attention to while the waiters constantly checked up on the other customers. You're better off at Lemongrass Cafe where their staff is actually nice and their pho is amazing and cheap."}
{"text":"Great recommendation by my friend! I came during their happy hour with my boyfriend (which is 3-5). They have select appetizers for $5 and some of their pho selections are cheaper. Since it was our first time there we ordered their combination special. It did not disappoint!!! I'm not a great teller on what's super good pho wise but my viet boyfriend is! Lol But I didn't have to be an expert to agree that the broth here is great! It's on the top of our list now. Great amount of meat in each serving, and they also have the option of having a smaller/larger bowl. The small was perfectly filling for me and we also had their spring roll appetizer which was delicious! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really amazing and quick service and pho - tasty and very accommodating for food allergies/modifications. Great place - recommend it for take out."}
{"text":"Where's the beef?  I am use to more meat in my pho.  I fished out 5 slices...pretty weak!  The price is on the high side considering the size of the bowl & the lack of meat.  Flavor was decent...    The springrolls looked like an 8 year old rolled them.  I've made better tasting & more uniform springrolls at home.  The place is hit or miss on service depending on who's working.  It's actually very good for the most part...the younger kid isn't the one you want waiting on you.  It's a clean place...they just need to iron out the wrinkles.  It's close to me so I guess I will eventually give them yet another shot, but this time trying out their rice dishes & banh mi."}
{"text":"I am so happy there is a good Vietnamese restaurant here! Came in on a Thursday night and got seated right away! Staff was very friendly. I liked the fact that we order coffee and the waiter made sure to let us know that it will take awhile because they way Vietnamese coffee is brewed. We order Pho of course with fried egg rolls on the side. What I liked is that they had a variety of Vietnamese food and some restaurants do not have that. I'm so happy I found a good Vietnamese restaurant whenever I'm back in Vegas I know where to go!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since 2011 ! The food, service and price is excellent ! They've added Happy Hour [from 3-5] too - don't miss it !"}
{"text":"Walked in at 8:25, they close at 9:00, male said we are closing in 5 minutes (even though sign on door still says closing at 9:00) they turned us away, then as we were walking out he says wait if you can order in 5 minutes we can stay...um no we are out, terrible service. Besides they aren't the only Pho in Henderson any longer..."}
{"text":"Came here last week.  The food was good, I don't have any complaints about it but my wife is Vietnamese and so has very high standards as to her critiques.  So it wasn't mind-blowing Pho so thats why only 3 stars.  However what is worthy of noting is the great service we experienced when we were here.  Unfortunately we sat in a booth that was neighboring two girls who were seated behind my wife.  These girls were absolutely disgusting: they were burping loudly, singing loudly (horribly), throwing stuff at each other, and just being completely rude, childish, and disruptive.  At one point water starts dripping down the booth almost getting my wife's clothes wet.  The manager happened to be there and I pointed to it and he looked up as if it was the ceiling leaking, I told him where the source was from though: the girls.  He very politely asked them to stop throwing spit balls (yup, they were shooting spit balls at each other and throwing ice cubes), and they were very rude to him saying \"what? what?\" Then my wife got up turned around and told them to knock the shit off.  To our surprise they weren't 15 year old girls but two 26 year olds, one of whom was wearing scrubs (geeze I hope she's not an actual nurse)  He apologized and apologized to us like 5 times, which was awesome but we wish they would have apologized to him.  Anyways they left him a nasty note and we left him a good tip.  But that attitude you just rarely see: the one where the manager is ensuring the experience for all his guests is a good one, with total disregard to whether or not it is his fault or the fault of others.  This guy deserves a raise, he is a great worker here.  And for that I have upped my review to 4 stars."}
{"text":"As much as we wanted to like this place we could not get over the fact that the soup broth was watery and lacked flavor. We have had better. I gave them one star because our waitress had great customer service."}
{"text":"Affordable, fast, and yummy.  We'll definitely visit again!  I ordered the B4 (Bun Cha Gio Thit Nuong) which is a vermicelli bowl with pork and imperial rolls.  It was pretty standard, nothing fancy.  The pork had great flavor and was tender, plus there was a lot of it!  The imperial rolls were delicious, too.  My friend ordered the BM2 (Banh Mi Thit Nuong), a pork sandwich.  They said it was also pretty good."}
{"text":"Went here a couple days ago and guess what??? They were outta Pho!!! Are you Pho-ken kidding me???  It's like going to a Pizza parlor only to be told \"sorry we are out of Pizza!\""}
{"text":"Our first visit here turned out well.  Got greeted and seated immediately.  Looking through the menu at first was a little overwhelming.....consisted of several pages to peruse through.  We settled on large bowls of Pho beef noodle soup.  If you want vegetables in your soup then you have to request an \"add on\" (additional $2.50 charge) so we ordered one extra veggie bowl on the side and 2 of us were able to share it.  We found the soup to be very flavorful and filling!  Don't drink all the broth if you need to watch your sodium intake!  The staff provided good service and were attentive. We will absolutely come back and try other items!  :-))"}
{"text":"Sorry Pho Mailan some how the wrong number was entered after I had the right number."}
{"text":"We just love their Pho.  Can't comment on anything else since that is all we order.   I usually get take-out.   Deep flavor of the broth and lots of tasty and fresh vegs to add.  Choose which meats you like.  Friendly staff and prices that are great."}
{"text":"First time here and wasn't too impressed by the food.  Upon entering the restaurant, I must admit it's cleaner than most Vietnamese restaurants I have been to.  The staff was ok.  Takes awhile to be seated even when the place wasn't full.  Order came quick but the food was mediocre.  Had better some place else.  Pricing is average compared to other places.  Unfortunately, will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is the best and most affordable Vietnamese place in Henderson. Great staff/service and really relaxing atmosphere. I eat here as often as possible and love the happy hour deals! Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Still a fan! The beef stew is a fantastic option for the extra cold weather and a new favorite. Mine came with super tender chunks of beef and some tendon. The Pho Ga seems to be hit or miss, but it can be good. The spicy chicken wings are good and definitely spiiiiiiiiiicy."}
{"text":"I ordered too much.  I guess I am used to some places skimping on ingredients in the vermicelli bowls, but I was stuffed.  very clean,"}
{"text":"I have been here many times with my family. We all love it. Great pho and their other dishes are quite good as well. definitely a staple if you live in the area!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite local pho place! The inside of the restaurant is always clean and presentable. Very friendly staff and the food is always fresh!"}
{"text":"i love their brisket Pho!  Ive never ate at the restaurant but get it \"to go\" and they always do a great job!  The brisket is fatty and delicious!  I love it, I chop it up and drop it in the soup!"}
{"text":"Friendliest, kindly people inside. Clean! Wonderful food. Enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. I am a no carb person and they brought my pho without noodles! That was one reason I had not gone to a pho restaurant before but my sister encouraged me to do so. Glad I did. I will be coming back on a routine basis for fresh delicious food!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. And the waiters were friendly. We loved the pho combination. Worth the drive."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Amazing; Healthy, great food. I highly recommend this place. I'm from Seattle where Vietnamese food is popular; I'm stoked for this kind of restaurant in Vegas."}
{"text":"We were hanging out and running errands in Henderson all day Saturday and worked up a mean appetite. It was 95 degrees out, but that didn't stop our hot bowl of pho cravings! We decided to give this place a try, since most of the yelp reviews were tried and true.   Luckily we came at 4:45pm, just in time for happy hour, which is from 3-5pm (everyday)  This is what we ordered from the happy hour menu: all $5 each  Chao tom (shrimp cake/ shrimp patty) spring rolls - It was 2 rolls cut in half, making it 4 pieces and it was lacking so much! There was a paper thin piece of (chao tom) shrimp patty and it was all lettuce for the most part. The hoisen dipping sauce was tasty, but I just couldn't get past how skimped they were on the rolls. Not worth it, even at the happy hour price of $5. 1/5  Spicy chicken wings - These came out fresh from the fryer in 8 good sized, meaty wings. These were incredibly crispy and saucy! Packed with flavor, salty sweet, and spicy. I love how they were not afraid to pack on the flavor on each wing. Definitely finger lickin' good! 5/5  Pho dac biet (beef special pho) - the broth was good, yet the tendon was not tender and not good cuts. My boyfriend took them all out of his soup since he couldn't eat them - which is odd and not like him at all, since he loves tendon. Yet, for $5 for a small bowl, it's a good deal. 3/5  Pho ga (chicken pho) - the broth was good as well, but I couldn't really enjoy my chicken - they were pretty dry slices. Overall it wasn't the worst pho ga I've ever had and for $5 a bowl, it's still a great deal. 3/5  An hour after dinner we were the thirstiest we've ever been - I felt super dehydrated. As you an imagine, the food was very salty. Oh well, I guess If you want big flavor, you have to expect to be salt-bombed."}
{"text":"This is some pretty good Pho. Didn't want to drive all the way to Chinatown anymore since I live closer to this area now....and thanks to Yelp, I may have found my go-to Pho restaurant.  I'm a creature of habit so I've been ordering Pho Tai since them early high school days. Either that or some kind of Vermicelli bowl....depending on my mood. Pho Tai is good here....although...I've got to say they give you wayyyyy tooo much noodles and not enough beef. I probably got like 5 slices of beef? Is that normal here? $7.50 for a small bowl and I think $8.50+ for a large bowl?  For an appetizer, we got the summer roll. It was my boyfriend's first time eating that and he loved it!!!! You get two rolls...each cut in half. Very light and refreshing."}
{"text":"The summer rolls were well put together with fresh ingredients and the peanut dipping sauce had actual peanut halves that were crunchy in texture. The wait time and ambience were average. The bean sprouts and jalapeños were fresh. I'm used to having mint but experiencing the actual lemongrass was refreshing. I usually judge how good a bowl of pho is by the broth, it was very flavorful and hardly oily, which is a plus since I'm already on a clean diet. The meats tasted fresh, lean, and the actual pieces themselves were more robust than your average bowl in LA. The noodles were perfectly textured and the serving size of a large was perfect. Lastly, the service was stellar. I didn't have to holler to get my glass filled with water or move plates to the side or wait long to get the check. I am definitely coming back to get the bun Bo hue and banh mi."}
{"text":"This place never fails.   Everything is always fresh and tasty.  Love the noodle dishes and of course the Pho soup.  Highly recommend.  Good prices and great food."}
{"text":"For starters....  WHAT THE #@*! HAPPENED TO THIS PLACE?!?!  Our overall experience with this restaurant yesterday was extremely disappointing, especially considering that not long ago (3 months?) it used to be one of our favorites.  And I don't believe they just had a random \"bad evening\".  First off, the young girl that started off with our table seemed completely lost.  How about some place settings?  How about some menus BEFORE asking what we wanted to order?  Considering we were all drinkers, how about taking a drink order?  Nope, she was just a little robot with zero common sense, zero waitressing skills, and apparently zero interest in doing anything because we never saw her again.  Oh well.  At least the food will be good right?  WRONG!  After awkwardly serving ONE PERSON AT A TIME over a 15-minute period, we finally had our food.  The spring rolls were different than the previous visit and very mediocre.  The vermicelli bowl was barely lukewarm accompanied by very cold soggy lettuce and cold water in the bottom of the bowl.  The vermicelli sauce had changed from our previous visit as well.  It was all edible, but crappy.  I'm giving it one star due to lousy service combined with food that was \"edible\" at best.  Nobody else in my party was very impressed either.  Supposedly it won a \"Best in Las Vegas\" award for 2015, but trust me, it will not be winning that award again.  Like I said before, it used to be our favorite.  But after yesterday, I will tell people to avoid it.  There are plenty of other Vietnamese restaurants in this town that blow this one away."}
{"text":"My family's go to Viet place when in Vegas! As a Vietnamese American, I have tried many Vietnamese restaurants everywhere I visit, including little Saigon in California that is the Mecca of Vietnamese food. Pho Mai Lan is delicious and provides a variety of Vietnamese foods. The combination pho is tasty and the soup is flavorful but not too overwhelming. The restaurant is spacious and the staff is good."}
{"text":"My husband and I discovered this place on one rainy Sunday. We were always going to Lemon Grass but wanted to try something different. What I love about this place is the tofu spring rolls...they're huge and delicious!! Their broth is always consistent and hot and service is awesome and the food comes out fast. Glad we found this place."}
{"text":"been here multiple times, food isnt bad!   Had the porkchop rice this time around and it was good! Well made and fresh!"}
{"text":"The tempura shrimp is the best I have had any place and the price is right. Beef noodle soup was excellent. Loved the spring rolls.    Have been there 2 times and each time was excellent and will be back."}
{"text":"Quite empty very spacious really great family venue. Had a party of 9 which they easily accommodated.  Parking ample and easy to find.   Items chosen included Eggrolls, shrimp and pork vermicelli, shrimp salad, catfish rice, spicy chicken wings, calamari, sizzling beef, & seafood noodle.   Egg Roll skin was not crispy as I'm used to. Filling not as tasty and condiments cut up a bit rough and wet (carrots not as long stringy for example). Probably wouldn't order that again.   The other items are really good. Shrimp salad it was just perfect with the right touch of sweetness we asked for salad without pork.  Chicken  wings had a wonderful sweetness n spicy tang . Seafood noodle was loaded with seafood. The sizzling beef was a bit on the tough side. Catfish is good. Calamari crunchy n tasty especially with sweet chili. We roll a bit different than American establishments since calamari usually served with lemon.   Thai iced tea is good but please don't stir in the cream for me. I like to see orange and white separation. That's how it's places serve it. I'm a sucker for mainstream normal in some cases.   Total for us $152 (gratuity included  for this large party.)   Million dollar question would we return? Yep we will!"}
{"text":"Certainly not my favorite.  Dirty dishes everywhere including all the way back to the bathrooms.  Food did not taste as freshly made as other places."}
{"text":"This used to be our family's spot! I don't know what happened but it makes me sad. I'll give it a 2 because the food really is delicious but the service has declined in the past year. The service used to be so much better but now I have to flag the waitresses and employees down to ask for a refill of water, the check, silverware etc. It's like after they got voted \"Best Vietnamese food in Las Vegas\" they stopped giving a f@$k. Ever since I think it was the manager guy with the hoop earrings left its just been on a steady downward slope.  Today I literally had to get up and stand there and wave for someone to come to our table. I also asked our waitress to split the check between my friend while we placed our order but she still brought one check, after I addressed it, there were excuses instead of an apology which was disappointing. Pho MaiLan your food is delicious but you all need to work on customer service. We've been coming faithfully to MaiLan since it opened but after today I think I'm done. The service there used to be UH-mazing and it shocks me that it declined so rapidly. There are so many delicious pho spots in Vegas I'm sure we won't have an issue finding another favorite. Deuces MaiLan"}
{"text":"We finally found our new favorite Vietnamese restaurant. Great ambiance, friendly service. The food is tasty!  Been to 2 other Vietnamese restaurants and this one is the best. Tried B1 - Combo Vermicelli bowl & P13 - Seafood Pho. Love it!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Its so clean and inviting & the staff is always nice and Professional.  And the food is delicious! I always get the Pho and mmmmm :) so yummy! I would recommend all of my friends and family here!"}
{"text":"This place is great and the staff is super friendly.  I'm no Pho expert, and they're more than willing to answer questions about the many options on the menu.   It's really delicious and I'll be returning often.  Oh!  If you show up in the afternoons (3pm-5pm I think?) it's happy hour, and a bowl is only $5!"}
{"text":"Excellent Pho is a nice atmosphere!  Delicious!! Generous portions, clean tasting and good prices.  It's in a quiet part of town in Henderson on south Eastern Ave. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Pho Malin.. I am in love with this restaurant, I just wish only two things, one you would adjust your prices for vegetarian food items and meat items, no way I should be charged the same for a Summer Roll that has zero meat in it compared to the ones that have all kinds of meat in it, makes no since and then second open a location in Henderson!! I need you everyday!  Pho Malin, you are amazing, your Pho is one of the best. I placed my order to go and they gave me the best amount of sides I have received from any Pho location, the to go box came with a large amount of chicken and broth only thing I was unsure of was did they not give me enough noodles or did I eat them all too fast? The amount of  broth  remaining was crazy! Love me some Pho with Lime! And Mint and Soy Sauce.. yummmm.. I will be back tomorrow!  Priced at about $10 for the Pho And $6.50 for the Fresh Summer Roll Veggie style .. since they charge the same with meat I always ask for my shrimp on the side!! (Hence the bag of shrimp in the photo)"}
{"text":"Well I gotta admit I am kind of a pho junkie.  My gf is half vietnamese so we are always hitting up the local places to get our fix.  Beings she is half vietnamese, and her family has some awesome cooks, I tend to know if the pho is good or just mmmmhhhh.  Pho MaiLan I really enjoy.  I have been here about 8 times or so and have gotten various things on the menu.  Unlike other pho places where the broth is really bland and very blah, pho mailan you can really taste the spices they use.  The eggrolls are yummy too.   The sandwiches I get occasionally to go for lunch tomorrow, but I would have to say that they aren't 5 star, maybe 3.  All in all its yummy, the staff is friendly, and it has free wi-fi for my entertainment pleasure.  :)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today food was really good... I tell you the water here is amazing.. lol"}
{"text":"Service is like any other Vietnamese restaurant.  They have pretty good egg rolls 4/5* Pho is 2/5* broth wasn't really rich and full of beef bone flavors. Vermicelli bowls 2/5* the noodles were hard... like old, cold noodles.  I asked for a bottled water, the kid said he didn't have any then pulled one out of a hat and handed it to me. It was hot with crud stuck all over it and bent... what The heck? Where did you really pull this out of?!  And why the hell did you even give it to me?  I handed it back to him. Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"Not worth the wait.  Not even close to \"Best Vietnamese Food\".  The grilled pork in my banh mi was tough. The bread and the vegetables seemed dry and lacked dressing/sauce to keep it together."}
{"text":"This is the first time I had bad customer service. I ordered a bowl of pho, instead the vermichelli I got the egg noodles. When I took that first bite of egg noodles it was soggy and the texture is bad. I was thinking dang these egg noodles must be old. So I ask the lady if I can exchange the egg noodles to vermichelli, she was like no the noodles are usually like that. In my mind, I'm like hell no the noodles was suppose to be a little hard."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of 8 and we were seated pretty fast. Although their prices are little more expensive then back where I'm from ($10-12pp). The portions are TINY for what you get. Their large is a regular here.... It tasted pretty good comparing to the Pho places here since I'm from the San Gabriel Valley. However, I guess things are more expensive and smaller portions out in Henderson....It would be a place to stop by if you want some authentic Vietnamese food in this area though! One thing I'm really happy with was the fact that our server gave us the option to split our bill individually before we even considered it! That was a plus since their menu said 18% service fee for parties of 6 or more."}
{"text":"Excellent. I love Asian food and it was delicious. Appetizers are very good (summer rolls) and the ban mi sandwiches are to try !!!"}
{"text":"We first tried this place when it opened a couple of years back and hadnt been back until tonight. We were contemplating picking up from Pho Saigon 8 but thought why not get from closer to home (about 5 minutes)? I have to say, very glad we gave this place a second chance.    Had 2 large orders of pho tai (rare steak) 8.00 each and an order of springs rolls (fried egg rolls) 6.00 for 4 rolls. I have to say the amount of noodles and beef was way more than my husband and I could finish! I am a very hearty eater by the way...Our large bowls at home were about to overflow with all the food and I actually didnt eat all of the noodles. Each of us had about 12 pieces of steak, which is generous.   The broth was still boiling hot and when we poured it over the beef and noodles, the meat cooked instantly. The soup was flavorful, not overly oily and really hit the spot. the spring rolls were average, no worse or better than other pho places we've tried. It does seem though maybe take out is the way to go!   The only downside was the green leaf lettuce that you wrap the spring rolls in was a little wilted and brown along the edges. Had they been really fresh, it would have almost been 5 stars. We will order from them again!"}
{"text":"Second time having takeout here and it has officially become our go-to pho place. I got their \"special\" mi xao don with seafood. I'm glad only family was around for dinner because I'm actually kind of embarrassed at how fast I stuffed this in my face. It's just that yummy. Fast, friendly service. They don't screw up the order. Good prices. We love them"}
{"text":"We've always had a good experience every time we go to Vegas. This is the spot of choice for authentic and tasty pho. We usually get the combination pho and chicken wings and spring rolls. It is always consistently good. I can't complain. The service is reasonable even though at times they seem a little understaffed. We still get our food without waiting very long."}
{"text":"Solid Pho, my wife loves Pho and uses all the ingredients provided and she is a fan as well. I enjoy getting Pho Mailan Post mated to our house, it's a reliable solid soup option. I'm a plain eater I like the broth, noodles and handful of ingredients. I'm always down to eat here"}
{"text":"Good Service and Good Food.  Mom and I went here the other night because we wanted something hot and simple... and Pho seemed like a good idea.  This was our first visit to this restaurant and we were happy with it.  We didn't order anything unusual... we were pretty boring in our selections.  So we'll go back and try something different next time.  Spring rolls... fresh and tasy.  I really like the peanut dipping sauce, very creamy.  If you like it spicy... add some chili garlic sauce to it like I did which punched it up nicely.  Chicken Pho.... quick and hot.  The broth was not oily like I've read in the other reviews so I'm wondering if maybe it's because chicken doesn't have much fat?  The Pho was good... not much to it until I added the bean sprouts, jalapenos, lime, basil and hot sauce.  Mine had lots of chicken in it so I was happy.  We each ordered a \"Regular\" and it was more than we could finish."}
{"text":"I ordered the tofu pho and it was good except there were only 3 small pieces of pho in there. I also prefer the pho fried so that is why this didn't get 5 stars. It would have been better with more tofu and with it cooked. The service was phenomenal!!!"}
{"text":"My first time ever having phô was here about 4 years ago on a date with my partner. We have been coming here ever since. The food is delicious and the service is efficient and above par. We always have to have the shrimp fried rice with either the spring rolls or eggrolls. On top of the usual seafood phô and spicy beef noodle soup. Amazing!! We have not had a bad experience here (ok maybe once but that was many years ago and we blame it on shark week) please enjoy this hidden gem"}
{"text":"This place was recommended so I stopped in after work 1 night. I ordered 2 bowls, chicken satay and pork fried rice. I ordered the food to go and did not have to wait long. The staff were very friendly.  The food was a disappointment. The satay lacked flavor as did the Pho. The rice was ok but the beef in our bowls was primarily fat and gristle. On top of that it was expensive. We will not return."}
{"text":"I tended to like it here.  The food came quickly, and the service was nice and friendly.  We had a great young girl helping us most of the time who really made sure we had everything we needed, and explained any dishes we weren't sure about.  As far as food quality goes, white it certainly wasn't the best pho I've ever had, it's entirely okay when I'm craving pho and don't want to drive very far from my house.  As usual with Vietnamese restaurants, I'm always disappointed when banh mi isn't on the menu, but not every place can be a banh mi place!"}
{"text":"Pho Mailan was very clean and modern, compared to most. Service was good and prompt, while the food spoke for itself. Ordered Pho Ga, Pho Bo, Sweet and Sour Popcorn Chicken, Pork and Beef Sandwhich, Chicken Satay, Veggie Rolls, Egg Rolls & Spicy Beef Soup. Every dish was DELICIOUS! My Son loved the iced coffee, he ordered 2! Great/healthy fast food. A definite MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"I guess i've followed the majority of yelpers here as I am a fan of the Bun Bo Mai Lan. Spicy but not over bearing and the I licked the bowl dry bc the soup was so scrumcious.   For me the location is far but for anyone who lives in the east side this is a must!   If this were in Chinatown I'd go all the time especially since the service is akin to any non-Asian spot. It's a nice added touch to be treated nicely although what's most important is the quality of the food which they definitely do not short in.  Oh yah it's also clean too!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you wander around on Yelp and you stumble across hidden gems in your own neighborhood, this is the case with me and Pho MaiLan.  If not for Yelp, I would never know about it even though it's just half a block from my favorite Trader Joe's.  I see a lot of potential in Pho MaiLan, mostly due of their Bun Bo Hue, the Vietnamese spicy beef noodle soup, the less known cousin of Pho but definitely the more fitting noodle soup for cold weather.  It's made with a richer beef broth with a subtle hint of lemongrass flavor, a more hearty rice vermicelli, and filling proteins such as beef shank, pork hock, beef tendon & pork blood.  It's a favorite among Vietnamese but difficult to make well, and thus I haven't had a very good bowl since moving to Vegas from Orange County.  Pho MaiLan's version is very tasty without being too fatty, something that I've rarely found in Vegas.  I'm giving it a three stars only because tonight's bowl was missing a couple of things to be authentic: there was no pork blood; also, banana blossom and shredded cabbage should be served as the accompanying veggies but they ran out of banana blossom this evening.    My fiance had Pho, it was good, not the best Pho broth in Vegas but it had a good amount of meat and the beef's quality was very good.  We also had egg rolls for appetizers.  The egg rolls were good; however, I was disappointed because I read from Yelp that the restaurant had Banh Beo (floating rice cakes with shrimp) but they also ran out of that tonight.    On a positive note, the service is great, the waitresses were very friendly and attentive.  The restaurant's atmosphere is cheery and clean (all the sauce bottles seem to be filled and cleaned often).  The Bun Bo is still the best one in Vegas so far for me, but I'm looking forward to a more complete version next time."}
{"text":"The service was okay. The Pho could have been better.  The french bread was yummy.  If you are craving good soup, go down the street to Pho Saigon 8..."}
{"text":"Our favorite Vietnamese Restaurant!!! I love their fresh summer roll with peanut sauce! Everything here taste good!"}
{"text":"Great place go pho. It always hot and fresh. The beef broth is delicious and they are generous with the meat portions."}
{"text":"This is my go to place in Henderson for Vietnamese food. Food has been consistent, service is good, and clean."}
{"text":"Not the best place for pho, id honestly rather drive down a bit further to go to pho Saigon. This is not authentic Vietnamese."}
{"text":"I ordered the lemongrass chicken and I ate two bites and was done. I thought if I took another bite, I wouldn't be able to keep it down. My husband, who eats anything, wouldn't eat it either. The chicken tasted like it's pre cooked and reheated.  All I could think of was that this place should be on kitchen nightmares. The plastic on the bench seat was split. The walls and floor need a good cleaning. I will NEVER go back.   I will admit that I am a picky eater and I hate complaining in restaurants. We paid $30 for two meals and ate two bites of mine and about 5 bites of my husbands. We paid and left full plates on the table. I couldn't get out of there fast enough!"}
{"text":"Food was just ok.  Beef noodle soup was very oily and chunks of fat in it. Shrimp dish over crispy noodles was pretty good.  The servers here REALLY need some training though.  Food was brought out and we were on our own.....nobody to check if it was ok....offer more drinks...nothing.  However as soon as we had finished eating - the bill was dropped on the table.  (forget about offering us dessert or coffee) - basically 'please pay your bill and leave'.  They didn't even bother to clear our meal dishes away until we left.  I wanted to take some of the leftovers home and we were handed a plastic container and struggled to get the soup into it without dumping it all over the table.  They weren't busy so some help would have been nice.  Strange place.  For those prices I expect more."}
{"text":"Great service even when getting take out!! I wasn't sure about some wordings but he educated me on different meats to make sure I got what I wanted!!"}
{"text":"I've been trying to decide whether to give this place four or five stars and it's a pretty close call. Last night was my first time at Pho Mailan as I'm new to the area. My first impression was a good one; clean, airy, comfortable atmosphere. Service was quick and I had nothing to complain about. There also seemed to be a lot of regulars which is always a good sign. The broth was fragrant and light, and was topped with plenty of greens and vegetables which I love. Pho is one of my favorite things ever, so I've had quite a bit in my day. I like to feel good about myself when I eat Pho, so I'm bummed when I get broth that is dark and oily and I feel disgusting afterwards. This had none of those qualities so I am assuming they don't use MSG, can't swear to it since I'm not an expert, but I felt nothing but happy about having a belly full of hot soup. My only complaint is that they only have two sizes for Pho... I would be thrilled to see an extra large on the menu. I also didn't see an \"extras\" section on the menu where you can double up on meat, get add on's etc., but I will definitely be asking the next time I go for Pho because I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"So I love this place and I know I recently gave a high rating but I am really disappointed with the level of service I got here when my daughter and I went in again. I was ignored as we stood there to be greeted. We sat ourselves and got a menu then it was a good 10 minutes until someone came to take my order. I tried finding my server or someone to wave down as we didn't receive any napkins or anything to drink the whole meal. I was done at this point and finally got someone to pack my food up. She disappeared and I don't know where my food went? The trash??"}
{"text":"Decided last minute to go get some Vietnamese. We were sat right away. The service was very attentive. I ordered a veggie pho, which was very good.  Close to home and tasty, and unlike most Vietnamese restaurants, the service was good."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best Vietnamese food in all of Las Vegas. The service is fast and friendly and always delivers quality on a consistent basis."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and ordered the chicken and egg roll vermicelli bowl with a glass of unsweetened iced tea (I didn't specify what kind of tea, expecting the usual restaurant fare of black tea, and received a tasty glass of jasmine which complimented the meal quite well). Our server was very friendly and our food was brought to the table quickly, the dishes mixed by our server right at the table. The food itself was scrumptious, and there was far more of it than either of us expected for the price. All in all, an excellent lunch experience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend thinks their fried rice is the best is ever eaten. I love their pho and the spring rolls. I feel like they up their prices because of the location, but it's our go to when we are having a lazy night and want some grub. I love the decoration."}
{"text":"What a fantastic restaurant! Our first time experiencing Pho. Eric was very kind and understanding. He explained the proper way to order as well eat Pho. Thank you for everything we will definitely be back and spread the word of the wonderful Pho, atmosphere and staff."}
{"text":"One of the best pho restaurants in town.  The waiters and waitresses are so friendly!  The decor is clean and modern, and it is one of those rare places where the food you order comes out looking just as nice as it does in the menu photos.  The tofu spring rolls are delicious, as is the grilled chicken and rice dish. Great food, good prices, excellent service, and a nice atmosphere.  You really can't go wrong with Pho Mailan."}
{"text":"Went last week because I was craving Banh MI. Got the Banh Mi combo. Good price, good quality. The service was very friendly. I would go back. It's a nice little place."}
{"text":"I've only been twice but both times have been enjoyable and the food is very good! I really like the satay chicken and spring rolls... the Pho is pretty good going up against all the other places... this place has a great fresh smell too- which is nice when you're eating! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the BEST pho I've had.   A while back I asked my Vietnamese friend where he goes for good pho, and he told me Pho Mailan is his favorite. I've been hooked ever since. I drive by 5 pho places on the way to Mailan, but I wouldn't even consider going to any of the others. I took my parents there, and now they take all their friends there. I usually eat there about twice a week.   We've tried almost all the appetizers and haven't found anything we don't like yet. I always get the P10, chicken pho. It's the only place I've been to that serves thick, white meat chicken in their pho. No dark meat or gristle ever!  That's the main reason I only go to Pho Mailan.   It's clean and nicely decorated inside. The staff is polite, especially the owner. He takes a lot of pride in his food. Prices are reasonable, especially now that they offer $5 pho during happy hour from 3-5pm."}
{"text":"My favorite literally eat there once a week. They close early so take out is a must. Coconut water fur hangovers and Thai tea for a quick buzz!! Veggie egg rolls all day!!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. But the pho and summer rolls lack flavor. Also, rice noodles. Rice noodles everywhere. Too much rice noodles. It's a cheap, tasteless filler.  Five stars for the customer service.  One star for the food.  I'll stick to Lemongrass Cafe."}
{"text":"I had my first experience with Pho this past Friday here and it will probably be my last. The other reviewers must all be friends of the owners because the specialty soup was just nasty. The staff was very nice and polite but I'm not sure what they tried to serve me. I posted a photo of the soup to hundreds of people through Facebook and  all the comments stated that  they never seen anything like that before even when they ate Pho Vietnam.   Take a look at my photo. That is actually the hoof or snout of some animal in my soup and my GFs as well. I have attached a picture so you can see.  The photo speaks for itself.   Sorry Pho MaiLan. I so wanted to give you a good review, and I just raised the the amount of stars I gave you specifically for your good customer service and for asking us to come back and try something that may not be so daring for first timers."}
{"text":"Wow, Everything we ordered was wrong including the drinks! The Pho was bland, the chicken was dry, and waiter was rude.  I've been a fan of Vietnamese for a long time and have eaten all over North America, this is by far the worst Vietnamese I have ever had by far. Something is very wrong here."}
{"text":"I've had trouble finding a really good Vietnamese restaurant in terms of both quality of food and service. Many Oriental places have fairly surly or indifferent service (I can say this because I'm Oriental) but Pho MaiLan was outstanding on both counts. We had roasted chicken on rice and short ribs on rice, as well as incredible shrimp paste and smoked salmon rice paper salad rolls.  The service was very attentive and not too busy even on a Friday night - it's a little bit of a drive from central Henderson (being near Horizon Ridge  Parkway on Eastern) but it's worth it. My wife and I will be back soon;."}
{"text":"The food here is really good. We've tried various items and haven't been disappointed in the many times we've visited. The 4 stars is because of the service. They're a bit inattentive. All the times we've come in (which were not busy times), our servers don't check up on us after receiving our meals and the wait for our check would be about 15-20 mins maybe more unless we flag someone down. Other than that small nitpick, I'd recommend this restaurant for great Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Its Pho - so you know its yummy!!  Which is the only thing this place has going for it.  Staff.  I actually think they are fem-bots.  They dont speak.  They just kinda grunt.  ZERO customer engagement!!  Caution:  watch your veggies!!  Often they are slimy & wilted.   The meat portions are minuscule.    Bottom line:  if the sun & moon all align & the veggies are healthy and a few extra slivers of meat fall into your bowl your meal will be tasty!"}
{"text":"My favorite pho restaurant I probably eat here 3 times per week everything is yummy and staff is wonderful"}
{"text":"What a great place! Customer service was excellent, very attentive. My Pho was delicious, best I've had! Will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Several times that hubby and I have been back, the broth is still as delicious as the first time we had it.  However, the meat quality has gone down.  The meatball tasted like it was freezer burned.  After one bite, I fished out the meatballs and dumped it.  Just a couple of days ago, I decided to get the chicken pho in beef broth, to go.  When we got home, I opened the box and took the slices of chicken out and lo and behold, the slices of chicken must have just got taken out of the freezer!  There were some frost on them.  Hubby and I are very disappointed as this is our go-to for a nice bowl of pho.  I don't know when is the next time we will come back, but for now, it will be on our maybe list."}
{"text":"Really nice Vietnamese place! I ordered pho tai and fresh spring rolls while my friend ordered some kind of stew with baguette on the side. We both loved our meals!!! Delicious Vietnamese food! The place was also very laid back and easy going. They have lots of customers but there's always enough staff and they're attentive for whatever you need! Food comes fast as well! Will definitely come back to this place! I've also tried them from DoorDash/Grubhub and orders are pretty consistent and I love how cheap it is!!! Thai tea is very good as well!"}
{"text":"We haven't had Pho for a long time. This place was close to where we were staying so we decided to give it a try. We were very happy with the food. Summer Rolls were light and crispy and the Pho was hot and very flavorful. Not so salty like we've had many other places.  We'll be back the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"The service is always friendly and the food is great!  I've never seen it very busy either."}
{"text":"I think I found my calling I love there Pho/soup. I've been there three times this week the place and the food are impeccable as you walk in you feel the cleanliness of the place the welcoming staff. It's an experience this place is really the best one."}
{"text":"Best Pho we have found in Vegas!  Always friendly service, and the restaurant is very clean.  Also try the tofu spring rolls and a Vietnamese coffee (unique and much better than regular coffee!)"}
{"text":"The best Pho I ever had and I love the atmosphere as well. It's up the street from my house and price is very reasonable. My new favorite place for Pho!"}
{"text":"My husband and I used to come here frequently and then stepped in one day during winter to find the place freezing. It was so cold the waiter was wearing a hat and gloves, we could barely enjoy our meal. Our waiter told us the owner refused to put the heat on higher. Fast forward to a couple weekends ago we were down the street and decided to try this place out again, this time there was a family complaining to the owner about how hot it was and they stated\" we tell you this all the time in the summer and winter you need to fix the temperature or people will leave\" . The owner did not seem phased at all by this. Nonetheless I could barely eat my meal it was so hot in there. The biggest pro they have is their varied appetizer list compared to most other pho restaurants. However they aren't all that."}
{"text":"If you're in Henderson Seven Hills area, and love pho, this is the place to go. I've lost count how many times I've been here to satisfy my pho cravings, but I swear it got better with each and every visit. The combination bowl is worth every penny. There are two sizes available, regular and large. Unlike many other places, when you order a larger bowl, they don't just fill it with more broth. Pho Mailan fills it with more meat, noodles, and everything else to make the $1 difference completely worth it.   Their appetizers are a bit on the pricier side ($6 for an order of spring rolls is a bit expensive), and that automatically docks one star from my review. But nonetheless, the food is great, the owners are very polite and courteous, and I can guarantee you won't leave dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Amazing soups. Broth is incredible!  Ba mi sandwiches were a bit of a dissapointment- I did not enjoy their style of bread, maybe others will."}
{"text":"I ordered a small pho with round steak, well done flank, and tendon. The portion size was pretty big for a \"small\" size and I thought there was plenty of meat included. We did stop by on a Monday night, so the service was quick and the waitresses were very nice! Unlike other reviewers' experiences, the broth was hot and I enjoyed my bowl of pho at Pho MaiLan!"}
{"text":"Being Vietnamese, my palette was craving my native food. I stumbled across Pho MaiLan, which seemed to have excellent reviews, so I decided to try it out. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I felt it was essentially the \"Panda Express\" of Vietnamese food, absent the Vietnamese flavors that I look for in a traditional dish. This is not to say that the food was not tasty; my point here is only that it lacks authenticity."}
{"text":"Had high hopes with this place after seeing pretty good reviews, however I just picked up a to go order, a single Pho Tai order and the beef was raw, which is normal, but it was also FROZEN. Needless to say, since it was frozen it didn't cook in the hot broth, it instead just made my broth cold. I had to heat it up on my stove in order for it to be edible. I guess when you call in an order for pick up, make sure you specify you don't want your meat frozen. I have it 2 stars instead of 1, because despite the frozen meat, after heating properly and eating the broth was very good."}
{"text":"Every visit I have made to this establishment has been wonderful. Friendly staff, excellent food. I never leave disappointed; just maybe a bit too full if I can't stop myself from polishing off everything ordered.   My favorites are the shrimp cake roll and any of the beef pho. Must have beverage of my choice is the iced ginger tea.  Highly recommend that you stop in and try some of the fantastic food, especially during happy hour which begins at 3!"}
{"text":"I love pho' n this place is clean n affordable n good location too not far from my house either"}
{"text":"We love this place this is our favorite new place for pho.  Fantastic lunch place and great deal $5 for a bowl of pho.  I would of giving it five stars except during dinner hours they do get quite busy and they lack in service."}
{"text":"Some of the best phò I've had in Vegas! Amazing broth. Great casual atmosphere and attentive service. Also a great price point. $7.50 for small phò and 8.50 for large. Also great appetizers!"}
{"text":"A great place to go when you are in need for a nice warm bowl of pho to beat the cold. They use fresh veggies and they service is good too!"}
{"text":"I've tried many different pho places and this one is by far the worst I've ever been to. I was really craving some pho after moving out here from Cali but I was completely disappointed. The broth wasn't hot, the soup didn't have any taste to it and the combination pho is waaay overpriced for a small bowl. If you're looking for good pho, I suggest Pho Saigon 8 which is down by north eastern - best pho ever."}
{"text":"Good Bun Bo Hue! Came here after a long night at the clubs with my girls... That first sip of soup was very satisfying... it wasn't too spicy, but had good flavor to the soup. I could taste the lemon grass and the pork bones. Only thing i didnt think was that the noodles were waaaaay overcooked, to the point there the noodles were all broken in my bowl :(  Others got the pho, which they seemed to like, and some got the pho ga and it seemed ok. Kind of plain tbh.   A bowl of noodles will cost you around 8-9 dollars. The spring rolls were pricey though, 6 dollars for 2 small rolls cut in half :(   I think I might come back though next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! My husband and I tried this place one night on a whim and it's awesome!!!! We have been back since then with our friends. Food is amazing, great customer service, and good prices!!!"}
{"text":"I usually always order phö from here and I've never been disappointed until now. I order a large portion of pho and received less than a handful of noodles. Ridiculous. Plus they forgot the cilantro and my veggie bag had maybe 15 bean sprouts and wilted basil. Time to find a new place to get phö."}
{"text":"Quick and consistent. Best Pho in this neck of the woods."}
{"text":"Excellent experience from the moment we stepped in to the restaurant. We were greeted with open tables and smiling faces of the workers and were immediately sat at a table. Very friendly workers all throughout the restaurant.  For appetizers we got the fried calamari, which were all rings and not the legs. My favorite! Served with a sweet chili sauce for dipping. We had no problem finishing that.   I got a small vegetable pho, the veggies included were tofu, broccoli and carrots. Bean sprouts & basil served on the side. The small portion was just right for me, I finished everything in my bowl except for some soup.   I also got to try the special spicy pho. I liked the spice level and the only thing different was the noodles. It was a little more thick than the one in the pho, but noodles are noodles in my opinion.  Thank you to the staff for being so friendly & accommodating on our first visit here. Definitely be back to try something new."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Been coming here for nearly 3 years and it is the best Pho in town. The employees are always great and the bossman is a real charmer! I love it here. It's worth the 20+ mile drive for some amazing service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Apparently we came in the wrong driveway and we're going all over the parking lot looking for the address.  We finally found it and when we went up to the door it was dark. The door was open so we went in and discovered we were coming in from the back door.  LOL.  We were quickly greeted and seated.  Ordered the chicken and shrimp vermicelli noodles (bun) and a pork combo banh mi.  Food came quick and smelled great.  Had 3 good size shrimp grilled to perfection.  The bun was good along with the grilled chicken breast.  Hubby thought his banh mi was a bit salty but ate it nevertheless.  Lots of customers were getting the pho.  The pho comes in regular and large size.  The bowls looked huge.  The servers do not smile but I didn't care as the food made up for it.  Clean place and reasonable prices.   After a long hiatus, it was time to get some bun and a banh mi.  We are visiting Vegas and getting our fill of Asian cuisine.  Greeted and seated immediately.  The server also came to take our order immediately but we hadn't even opened the menu!  Our waters came while we reviewed the menu.  We ordered the chicken and egg roll bun and the combo banh mi (Marinated Grilled pork and beef, and steamed pork).  Service was quick and our food arrived.  We both enjoyed our meals although hubby said the meats were rather salty and the banh mi could have included more daikon and carrots.  Very clean environment.  We'll come back."}
{"text":"Really good Vietnamese food in Henderson. Service is quick.   Ordered the egg rolls, C7 marinated chicken and C11 Shaking beef. Really fresh and great flavor in all dishes.   Also had the honey ginger iced tea and limeade with club soda.   Food was good and came out fast. They have a happy hour for different appetizers for $5 each that I would come back to try."}
{"text":"The pho was up there with the best I've had! Hot, rich broth with great depth of flavor. Service good, nice clean place."}
{"text":"Fantastic service with friendly smiling staff from the moment I walked in. Atmosphere is bright and clean. Incredibly fast service with deliciously fresh flavors. So worth the drive!"}
{"text":"The pho broth here is amazing! I can't wait to come back and try more. The only thing I don't want again is there hot jasmine tea. The tea probably didn't steep enough to have any flavor. But the amazing pho broth well out weighs the not so good tea. Service was pretty good and the restaurant was very nice on the inside."}
{"text":"Love Pho Mailan! The chicken pho is the perfect comfort food and the combo Bahn mi is delicious! My son really likes the egg rolls! The restaurant is very nice inside and the service is great :)"}
{"text":"Pho lacked flavor and pricey! Had so much better in the valley. Nothing special to write about with the other dishes."}
{"text":"This place is legit.   Another recommendation by a friend who happens to be a local.  Dropped by with friends for a quick bite before going to the movies. We didn't have much time so we tried to rush the whole process.   We ordered everything in one go. 4 appetizers (3 rolls and shrimp skewer), pho for friends and the usual vermicelli for me.   The regular spring roll was decent, but the pork belly one was bananas. Had we had a little extra time I would've ordered another one for myself. It was so good.   The bbq beef vermicelli I had was hands down THE best I've had. Meat wise anyway. That was perfectly cooked and flavored  The service was also fantastic. I'm used to getting shitty service at Asian establishments since it's typically the norm. This place was a different story. They were attentive and on it.   I"}
{"text":"Was looking for a new place, and definitely found one! I ordered spring rolls (summer rolls) and a shrimp vermicelli bowl. Unfortunately they didn't have alternatives to meat broth (I can't have that), but I enjoyed my vermicelli dish. My friend liked the beef pho though! Wonderful service!"}
{"text":"Guys, this is probably the best Vietnamese food I've ever had in the country. Staff is friendly and food tastes great--we ordered spicy wings, pho and banh mi!!!!!! Try them out sometime!"}
{"text":"The Pho Ga was excellent, our other order with beef was too fatty but also good. Servers very friendly at 11 am. Will try the spicy wings and pork chops another time"}
{"text":"The Spicy Chicken Wings (aka Canh Ga Chien Nuoc Mam) are pretty close to our home style recipe.  I loved that they don't over batter the wings.  It's still crispy and piping hot when they bring it to you.  The sauce that goes on them has garlic, chilly, fish sauce, sugar, and love.  They offer this too during Happy Hour.  Yay!  If I'm in town, this is the place to get my fix on Vietnamese wings.  Credit due to my friend's referral to this spot.  Thankful and compliments to the chiefs."}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite to go for chicken Ga soup. This stuff is so addicting to eat its like eating a whole bad of  doritios , you can't stop. I have not tried anything else because this soup is so full of flavor. Friendly staff and fast service for takeout."}
{"text":"So I was up at Anthem visiting my sis.  Spent summer years (8) and finally college in Vegas and have seen so many good Vietnamese places come and go over the years.  Hard to find back in the 80's, but now so many.  Coming from So. Cal.  I take pride in knowing good Pho, vermicelli, and banh mi, especially as a white boy, hailing from the SGV.  Pho 79, Golden Deli, love it.  Pho MaiLan literally opened the day before and they did great.  Despite the economic climate, I was totally pulling for them.  The food and service was great.  I stop in every few weeks when I go visit sis.  Encourage you all to check it out!"}
{"text":"I was expecting this pho restaurant to look just like any other pho places here in vegas but I was pretty intrigued by the modern cute look of it inside.   We started of with fried egg rolls which tasted typically like any other egg rolls you get anywhere else (yummy) then we ordered Bahn Mi Dac Biet (Vietnamese sandwich) and Pho Dac Biet. The pho was pretty good that's probably for the most part why I gave this place a 5 star and also the look of the restaurant and good service.   I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Usually when u go somewhere 1 thing is good and the rest is okay. But I ordered combo pho, fried kalamari and spring rolls. All good! Excellent service as well. I've been to a lot of pho places in Hawaii and this one was amazing."}
{"text":"A go-to for pho in Henderson!   I always think to order something different from their menu, but their special pho is delicious and I always end up ordering it.    Generous meat portions, love their meatballs, and definitely, recommend happy hour food selections and enjoy their Vietnamese beer."}
{"text":"I loved the food here! The grilled chicken in my vermicelli bowl was so tender and the fish sauce tasted wonderful- all veggies were super fresh.    I had the pho the next day and it was perfect! I switched out rice noodles for glass noodles.    Will def go back next time I'm in Nevada."}
{"text":"Service has been much better than the first time I have been here (Valentine's day 2015).  The food quality is consistent.  Their pho broth is good, and noodles cooked perfectly.  I ordered a pho with round and meatballs, and got round and tendon instead.  It was corrected immediately with a fresh hot bowl with the correct meats and soup.  This is my go to pho place here in Vegas.  I have been here many times.  Always fast, clean, and consistent."}
{"text":"Pho restaurants are few and far between in Henderson, but if you don't want to drive out to Spring Mountain, this place could do the trick.  I finally decided to try Pho MaiLan for an early lunch under just that circumstance. I'm not convinced that they have Vietnamese ownership, but they do have a typical menu of appetizers, rice dishes, noodle dishes, and of course everyone's favorite Vietnamese beef noodle soup.  For me, it was straight to the Pho Chin Nam ($8.50 for my large bowl). The broth is fairly light on spices and flavor, but there was a passable amount of green onion and cilantro, and the meat had the tenderness and flavor that I expected. They didn't give enough Thai basil for two people and the bean sprouts weren't completely fresh, but the lime wedges and jalapeños were nice (although I didn't find that the lime helped the broth much this time). Gotta appreciate the plastic chopsticks instead of bamboo when you can get them too.  This could easily be 3 stars in another city or circumstance, but I enjoyed my meal enough that I'd give Pho MaiLan another shot some time. Call it \"3.5 stars rounded up\" if you will. It's a good enough soup with most of the elements of pho that it'd work in a pinch (namely the situation of not being in California)."}
{"text":"We like this place.  After moving to the area, we have probably eaten here more than any other local place.  As others have mentioned, some of the food is a little plain but the ingredients seem high quality and some of it is quite good.  As for the more moderately good things we have eaten there, it might just be that we have grown to prefer the depth of flavors that you find in Thai food over Vietnamese food, which seems a litte tamer.  But we still like Vietnamese food.  Also, we're not usually beef eaters, so we can't comment on that part of the menu which might well be the best part.  What keeps us returning is that the relationship between price and what you get is very good.  Staff/owners are very friendly, place is clean, seating always available although there is a steady stream of people coming and going including some getting take-out, and the food is always at least good if not great.  I'm not sure of where else (at a restaurant with table service, anyway) we could get two main courses, an appetizer, and two hot teas, leave a 20% tip, and have spent less than $30 for two people.  We'll be back, probably fairly regularly."}
{"text":"Absolutely pho-tastic!!! Everything on the menu is fabulous.  Plus they deliver!!"}
{"text":"The BF loves his PHO - not more than he loves me though- (let's hope) anyways, he told me that he spotted a Pho place in our area and was dieing to try it...So after weeks of saying not today I finally gave in. My first impression was that it was clean and decorated cute-it had a boutique feel to it. Which in my book was cool... On to the food-in the menu it looks like all of the Pho contains beef with the exception of one (chicken) but when we asked the nice waitress she said that for $1.00 more they can put shrimp instead of beef-Cool!!!  -Iced Tea: Be aware that it is lightly colored yellow (like pee) and has an extra light taste so light that it just about tasted like my water. The waitress said it was a green tea not black and that it was meant to be healthy and have a clean taste-the BF loved it. -Cha Gio (Crispy spring rolls): This dish is what determines for me if I want to return or not. In Guam these spring rolls are huge and full of clear noodles,tiny bits of pork and veggies and flavored with lots of black pepper-hella good, I miss it. I'm always trying to find a place that sells something similar.This dish is served with big lettuce leaves for you to wrap the egg rolls in and pickled carrots/daikon(could've been pickled longer) to add with fish sauce to dip-These were OK - I hardly saw noodles and I would like them bigger-but still yummy.. -Com Thit Nuong (Thin sliced grilled marinated pork): This dish comes with rice and cucumbers,lettuce and a sliced tomato- there is never any sauce for the salad in Vietnamese Restrauants- The pork was really yummy-it was marinated well and finger lickin good however I didn't like my rice-I am so picky with my rice and I don't like seeing the bottom of the pot in the middle of my rice-I want my rice shiny white and this scoop of rice didn't do it for me... -Pho Ga(Chicken broth): This comes with rice noodles,shredded chicken,and lots of green oinons. I liked the broth, I thought it had just the right amount of seasoning-so soothing on a cold night... -Pho Tai(with shrimp instead): The BF absolutly loves his Pho no matter where we're at-he adds his siracha sauce,limes,and basil and he's in heaven-so yes he loved this dish. I like that this location is close to home and not jammed packed so that we feel like sardines like at other Pho places. I think we will be back again...."}
{"text":"I come here for the Pho and the good service...I've been to other Pho restaurants in the Henderson area and service is just terrible.. Pho Mailan..the employees are nice and helpful with ordering when you're trying something new..nice flat screen on the wall, so dinners have been great while watching a game on TV."}
{"text":"The server Paul is awesome! He was very attentive. The pho was terrible! Probably the worst I've ever had. How can you mess up on pho? Three stars for exceptional service!"}
{"text":"This place is clean and they are very attentive to the customer, especially if you let them know that it's your first time having this. So tasty!!!!!! I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to grab a bite to eat before we left good old Las Vegas, yelped pho and it brought us here.  The A/C wasn't working that well, still a little warm inside the restaurant, you gotta sweat for some pho, which is fine with me.  Service was top notch, the guy was really nice and sweet, got us everything we asked for. The food was fantastic, I would absolutely come back to this place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Food is ok to poor. Most notable is the terrible service and attitude of all the staff.  Tried several times because of location but will never come here again"}
{"text":"The pho is average but I'm giving it 4 stars for the customer service. Typical food at a pho restaurant, nothing different from the other Vietnamese restaurants. I would say the employees are always there for you and very attentive in case you need anything."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here. People were very welcoming and the food was delicious. Definitely coming back because of the good food and the convenience of how close it is to my house."}
{"text":"We got excited about trying this new Pho spot so close to our house! The place is beautiful! But I've got today this is absolutely the worse Pho I've ever had! The soup was soooo oily! So oily that even my 5 year old daughter would not eat it.... Which also in my opinion wasn't very tasty either. Also... The noodles were already MUSH by the time we got them... Needless to say.. We are never going back again... We are Lemongrass Cafe lovers! We go once a week! Sorry Pho Mailan!"}
{"text":"This place was completely amazing. Friendly, fast, clean and by far the BEST Pho soup we have ever had!!! We ordered the spicy beef noodle soup...I highly recommend it.  They really go out of their way to make everything perfect!!  This is def. Our new favorite place for dinner!!** Even the kids had no complaints!...We walked in at 8:20 unaware they closed at 9pm...even still...nothing was rushed!"}
{"text":"Had pho. Not bad. Not too much ingredients to add to it. Portion was on point. Cost was decent. Banh mi sandwich was different from typical ones. Location was good. But nothing that stands out and yells for me to come back. That's why it's an average rating only."}
{"text":"I asked the hubby if we could get Asian takeout for dinner, and Yelp steered us to this gem.  Being Vietnamese, I tend to be picky about my Viet dishes!  I got the grilled chicken over vermicelli. My particular combo came with 2 pork egg rolls. Standard dish, with two chicken pieces perfectly marinaded and grilled. Delicious!  I also ordered the banh mi with the grilled chicken. So good! It reminded me of the banh mi my mom would make when I was growing up.  Since this was a take out order, I skipped on the pho.  The food was solid, the prices are low, and the service (take out) was friendly.   Definitely stop by this place if you get a craving for home good ole Viet food!"}
{"text":"This place has Pretty good Pho. My Favorite were the grilled pork rolls though.  I wouldn't say it's the way though,sadly. But it's worth a try for sure."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Pho, but this place is good, I played it safe and got the S1 , spicy pho, and man thats Amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is very good for various selection of Vietnamese food! Pho is good as well as the rice and noodle dishes..,my favorites are chicken salad, lemongrass chicken with rice medium hot and combination bahmen sandwich. Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Honestly the best pho restaurant I have been to. Always super hot, not like other places I have been to. The egg rolls are delicious and the service is great. I drive all the way across town to eat here. It's the only pho restaurant I go to now. Definitely worth trying for anyone who likes Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Always good, clean flavors, consistent on food and service (especially Vincent and Jon) quality!  We have been coming here at least 2x a week and ordered different items on their menu and know we can rely on Pho Mailan 100%.  The owner works hard, we see him serving, clearing tables, behind the counter, always friendly and this show us he cares.  There are many Vietnamese restaurants in Vegas but we're not surprised why Pho Mailan is always full even on week nights."}
{"text":"Service was great. We were seated immediately. The place was really clean and nice. It wasn't too crowded when we got there, since they were closing in an hour. I ordered a pho with beef balls and my boyfriend had their combo pho. I had a thai tea to drink and my boyfriend had a smoothie. Our food came out quickly. The pho was pretty good! Not too greasy. I thought the broth was a little salty, but my boyfriend thought it was fine. I ordered a small size and it was more than enough to fill me up. My boyfriend ordered a large and ate the entire thing and was really full after. The thai tea was delicious, but I finished it quickly. Overall, the food was pretty good for the price."}
{"text":"We found this ditty after doing a search on yelp. It was a bit hard to find as there are lots of plazas in the neighbourhood and they are a bit of a maze if you are not familiar with this area around Henderson.  If looking for the resto it's near Lee's discount liquors.   Entering the restaurant is was clean, nicely decorated and the people seemed welcoming. My friend who I ate with is Vietnamese so I told him usually I prefer a bun noodle dish vs a pho on a day when the weather is 75F outside. I went with a grilled pork and spring roll and my friend went with a catfish bun noodle. We shared a bit of each and his catfish was fried in a very interesting batter with a bit of dill. It was excellent crisp and very  unique but tasty flavour. My grilled pork was well seasoned with a nice lemongrass flavour, sweetness and a bit of salty. Overall it was a strong 4/5 for me. Clean, tasty, good portion size and price (not too heavy) is in my mind a slam dunk for Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Got Pho combo. Tastes like how it's supposed to and they gave a lot of veggies. Happy tummy"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place again after not going there for almost 3 years. It's still just \"ok\". I think it's a pretty fair 3.6-3.8 star Pretty much your typical pho joint. Prices are about right compared to other places. However - be warned, we were at table of 4 adults and 2 small children and they automatically tacked on 18% gratuity.  Not a big deal but just be forewarned as it might catch some people by surprise.  Pho broth was good, seasoning just right. I did notice that even though we ordered the pho with the well done beef, it still came out super red. Not a big deal because the broth is piping hot and if you mix it to the bottom of the bowl right away it will cook itself no problem.  The fresh spring roll presentation was kinda cool - it had the leaf part of the lettuce sticking out the side."}
{"text":"I went here with my family today since it's brand new and really close to my house. I ordered the spicy beef pho.. I forgot the name, but it was S1 on the first page. I didn't really like it. Even though it was spicy (and I like spicy), I thought it was kind of plain and very oily, most of the meat pieces in the soup were fat and there weren't enough noodles for me. I did try the regular beef noodle pho, which was okay, but different than what I usually expect. Then again, I'm a die-hard Pho Kim Long fan.   On the other hand, the service was great. The server was very nice and when my mom said that her drink tasted like diet, the server brought out another Pepsi for her to drink right away. I ordered the thai tea too, but like Melissa N. said in the other review... it was kind of different and not really the best thai tea out there.   Anyway, I'll probably go back with my boyfriend and order something different. My mom said the pork chops were really good, and she finished those. I just won't order the spicy soup again."}
{"text":"pho is alright, nothing to brag about. service could of been better. Only gave 1star because the lettuce for our spring rolls was not fresh. the lettuce wasnt as crisp and as if it was not rinsed well enough."}
{"text":"Came back and ordered banh Mi beef sandwich.  Pickled carrots and daikon was ok (not pickled enough), however the beef was so tasty I couldn't stop eating.  The baguette was toasty on the outside; soft and fluffy inside.  Add the jalapenos, cucumbers, and cilintros, you have an irresistible sandwich."}
{"text":"I always come here and service is always amazing. Last night I tried requested my food a little different than usual do to a strict diet and they were perfectly okay with it. Definitely recommend this place for food and service."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here for lunch over the weekend and really enjoyed our meals. The inside of the restaurant was clean and simple.   The service was great from start to finish. We were greeted as soon as we walked in and quickly seated. The staff worked together to make sure we had everything we needed. It was a very short wait for our food.  Both of us went for Vermicilli Bowls. Mine had shrimp, sausage, pork, and egg rolls. His had sausage and egg rolls. They were both large portions full of meat, noodles, and vegetables. The flavors in the bowl were great. I liked the sauces on the table to help add more flavor and heat to the dishes. Pricing was very reasonable."}
{"text":"I just can't way enough positive things about Pho MaiLan! This restaurant is amazing, not only for its Pho but for its customer service. This is a hometown restaurant where the servers know you by face (and sometimes by name) and greet you as you walk in the door. We have ordered the soup and sandwiches, both of which are absolutely delicious. Portions are plentiful at Pho MaiLan. I will continue to frequent this restaurant whenever I'm craving a delicious, hot bowl of soup with all the toppings, and when I want 5 star service. By the way, Ryan is a wonderful server. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food we will definitely be back!!! Fresh ingredients and friendly staff! We used to drive all the way spring mountain and decatur to have pho... But now we found one right around the corner from us!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today for my pho experience. Service was ok. Not great. Not bad. Waitress seemed kind of overwhelmed. We watched two people walk out because they never got service. Food was the redeeming factor for this place. Food was very good. If they could fix the service issues this place would easily be a 4 or 5 star establishment."}
{"text":"Coming from Cali it's hard to find good food in Vegas especially when you're craving for a good bowl of pho. I went to Phi MaiLan with a low expectation hoping that maybe their food would prove me wrong and that it was worth going to eat and my instinct was pretty much right.  I ordered their pho and I tried the broth without putting any sauce just to see how it was and it wasn't bad. When I took a bite of the noodles, the noodles were really over cooked to the point where it was super soft. I had my girlfriend try it (she's Vietnamese) and she did not like it.  Before going to Pho MaiLan we read on the yelp reviews and it seemed to have many good reviews but like I said coming from Cali where there are lots of good food, this was not up there for us.  The staff was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"If you want the best Bun Bo Hue (BBH) in Vegas, Henderson, North Las Vegas and Summerlin, then Pho Mai Lan is the place to go.  We've been here several times since August, 2013 just to get the BBH.  It's authentic BBH and full of flavor.  However, we would not recommend anything else on the menu.  We tried rice dishes and appetizers and were not impress with any of them.  Waiters and waitresses were super friendly."}
{"text":"A solid choice. My large pho with steak and tripe ($9.50) was served fast and hot, and everything about it was just right. There's an extensive selection of other dishes on the menu as well, and I'll be back to try some of them next time I'm in the area..."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Checked their menu before visiting to make sure they had some vegetarian options. It appeared as if they had tofu rolls and a noodle option with tofu. I arrived only to discover they had no tofu and had to settle for the veggie egg rolls. I was going to leave but felt bad especially since I got lost looking for the restaurant.   The veggie egg rolls were uninspiring and had an odd sweet aftertaste to them. Something I am not used to. I understand restaurants will freeze egg rolls and cook to order but these rolls were not fresh at all. Due to the lack of tofu, they replaced the tofu In the noodle dish with more of the (to my dismay) veggie egg rolls. Everything on the menu had beef, pork, or chicken broth. Hmmmm maybe Vietnamese food is just not for vegetarians?  I am rating this restaurant two stars because the staff was pleasant and the space clean and bright BUT I will not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"I had lunch here yesterday. I normally don't give 5 start reviews, but because of the service of one man I did. Not to mention I enjoyed the food as well.  We accidentally went through the back entrance. I guess this happens time to time. There was a man who was sweeping and he graciously invited us in, joking how it didn't matter which entrance we came through. He turned out to me our server as well. It wasn't a large gesture, but I really liked his demeanor.  We ordered the tofu summer rolls. They were full of fresh veggies and breaded tofu served with peanut sauce with fresh peanuts.  For my main I had the beef ball pho. The broth had a nice rich meatiness to it. The balls had a good  consistency and taste. The noodles were round noodles, I'm use to flat noodles, but they were still good.  I'd recommend this place for your next pho craving!"}
{"text":"Today was definitely a pho day for me. I wanted to try someplace new and this restaurant caught my eye.   I did a take out order of combination pho, shrimp rolls, the vermicelli with chicken and egg rolls.   What bothered me the most was they put the raw beef, for my pho, in a opened zip bloc sandwich bag, in the same container as my cooked meat and noodles. I thought that was kind of gross, I didn't think that was sanitary at all. That kind of ruined it for me. I was pretty hesitant to eat my food.   Other than that, everything was good."}
{"text":"I would have rated them higher if the staff was competent.  We came as a party of 5 including a baby and was brought to a dirty table. We did not receive menus after the tables were cleaned. After looking around we took 2 from another table. While waiting around for a high chair we flagged down an employee to ask for more menus and she said they were probably out. Haha wtf? There weren't any other tables waiting to order. She handed us a few menus that were not cleaned. We had 3 different people come to our table asking if we were ready to order but no one asked what drinks we wanted. I don't know if this was at shift change...it was 7pm. Two of us ordered pho and the rest of us ordered something different. All four of us received our meals at different times. We only received one soup spoon for two phos. The server who we had for the majority of the meal was polite enough, maybe she realised what a shit show we were in...but the icing on the cake was when I went to use the bathroom they were out of toilet paper, there was pee on the sink, the sink looked like it's never been properly cleaned and the floors were covered in a black slug along the wall. Gross. I hope the kitchen wasn't like that too. So their saving grace for the two stars? The food was actually good."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time for lunch yesterday. The Pho was excellent. The egg rolls perfect. The small portions are more then enough for one person. Nice place, plenty of room...i.e. your not cramped together like other  places. Very crowded when we were there but the service was good and the prices are very reasonable. Plus they offer red wines and sake..... We will be back."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for dinner one night while I was visiting my sister who lives in the area. This is her favorite place for pho in Henderson and it did not disappoint. The broth was very flavorful and they served our soup with plenty of accompaniments... this is probably the first time ever I did not have to ask for more basil and chilies. The service was excellent and I thought the décor in the place was really cute. Everyone was very friendly and made sure we were happy with our food. I also love the fact that they have a small kids pho so even her three year old walked out with a happy belly.  While we were there they were hanging up a new sign for their happy hour pricing. Only $5 for a bowl of soup or any appetizer. What a great deal!"}
{"text":"There are so many different pho places here in Henderson and I have to say this is my absolute favorite.   I always love coming during the afternoon as it never is super busy around that time. There will be about only 3 other parties in there and it is pretty spacious compared to other pho places. The servers are friendly and quick to bring the food out. I love the waitress who leaves a pitcher of water at our table so we can refill our cups whenever.   My favorite starter to get is the spring rolls, they are nice and fresh but won't fill you up just in time for the pho. I always get P2 as I don't get too extravagant with my pho, the broth is the star in my opinion.   I always end up craving Pho MaiLan's pho more than any other place. Definitely a forever favorite."}
{"text":"It was gloomy day, looked like rain. So decided to get Pho, a Vietnamese soup.  I been driving by this Place everyday for almost a year. Finally decided to try it.  We got 2 beef soups with meatballs and thinly sliced beef, calamari, fried egg rolls and a banh mi vietnamese sandwich. The food was excellent. We enjoyed all, the broth was a little bland for my taste. I added some fish sauce, hoisin sauce, sriracha and pepper. My wife thought it was good, not a big deal for me.  If I could put a sixth star I would, the Vietnamese sandwich was excellent. I got bm1. With beef and pork, and it was tasty. I been tempted to get it for lunch because its so close.  We will back for sure, thank you Pho Mailan."}
{"text":"Don't believe their happy hour advertising, they tried to charge us regular price thinking we wouldn't notice in the bill and then the server said that the manager doesn't let them give shrimp for happy hour menu... When it clearly has an advertisement outside."}
{"text":"While normally amazing with great customer service with a smile. Today was sub-par with wilting poor quality vegetables for my pho. And today was service with an attitude. I'm not impressed! Management please address this!"}
{"text":"I really love the food here, but every time I come the service is horrible! It takes forever to get your servers attention and most of the time they have to get a second person because they don't understand what you're asking. The ginger tea is great when they have it available, and most everything I've tried is good."}
{"text":"Good local vietnamese spot if you're in the neighborhood!!    The Bun Bo Hue Mailan and Pho Combo are both very good.  The Bun Bo Hue is filled with good cuts and also has a good amount of side veggies for you to add into your noodle soup.  The soup for the pho is on the lighter side which I like a lot.    The fried eggrolls and the the spring rolls are both decent, nothing special about them but they are good and what you expect.    The place is very clean and roomy, the service is usually really good.  Tien is really quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I was craving Vietnamese food and decided to come here....this place is nice and pretty upscale.  The food is pretty good.  The bun (noodles) with catfish is to die for.  The bun with grilled meats and shrimp was pretty salty.  The eggrolls ain't all that.  The spicy chicken tossed in fish sauce, oh so yummy...may sound gross but man, this is bar food.  Yeuummm!  If you are looking for the vietnamese cafe with the dripping filter, this is the place for you.  The service was very friendly and attentive.  I will be coming back here again!  Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here occasionally for over 2 years, and I have never had a bad bowl of Pho. Portions are great, and the flavors are fresh. I wish I lived closer so I could be a regular customer, but I still get it every time that I'm on this side of town!"}
{"text":"Came in this place last week.  1st Time trying this Pho stuff.  It was pretty damn good....Pho Sho.  Really didn't know what to get so I got the Pork Chops, now I dont usually get me some swine when I eat out but these chops were good.  We also got some soup,it was nice and spicy and the size was big (for the small bowl).  I give a 4 stars for the friendly and helpful service and for the portion size and quality of the food.  And since its jus down the hill from me, more than likely LilMark will be back."}
{"text":"It is my first time trying this food, and I can say it well satisfied me. Recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite local Pho restaurant but the server tonight had way too much attitude to be a server. She was rude when she took our order and snatched the menus from our table and threw them down as she walked away. They really need to rethink who  they hire because I had to ask to have a different person to bring our food. Life is too short to deal with bad attitudes especially when I'm paying.    Update: I can happily say they got rid of miss moody and their service is back to normal. I eat here a couple times a month and it's my favorite place for good Pho."}
{"text":"Great food. Some were better than bay area. Portions are generous. off the strip, but worth the drive to get some good food."}
{"text":"I want to like this place more than I do because just as other reviewers claim the broth is the best. I've been in search all around our city for an all around consistent pho restaurant to frequent since I crave it literally once a week. One place will have a clean atmosphere but not have quality meats then another will have quality meats but not broth and so the search continues."}
{"text":"Been here a lot of time but my menu has changed since I don't eat meat anymore. With My lan they have variety of seafood on their menu. I'm glad this restaurant  is near my work so i can stop by after work. Oh and their customer service is superb, not to mention the owner is very friendly and courteous. Love this place."}
{"text":"Food was very good service was okay. The air conditioning was not working so we didn't stay long and people were sitting down then leaving but they were apologetic for it and they were having someone work on it not really too much else they could do"}
{"text":"It's very authentic, good prices, I came  for the combination sandwich. However I eat lots of Vietnamese sandwiches and by far I really enjoy thier meats and veggies were very fresh. However I'm a hungry guy and the sandwich was so delicious I could another one but I felt as if the meats wasn't enough. I've had bigger sandwiches before just as tasty. I'm new to Las Vegas and was hoping to find a meaty viet  sandwich"}
{"text":"I ordered the combination pho. The broth was not warm. When I say not warm, the meat was still rare and did not get cooked. I've tried pho at many places and this one in particular just wasn't anything special.   The marinated spicy wings were extremely oily and had a pungent weird smell to them. My boyfriend and I only had two of the six. We did not enjoy them.   I'm sure I could've ordered better but the spicy marinated wings were pictured on the wall and they were being portrayed as a popular choice.   I do like that this restaurant serves wine and beer."}
{"text":"Pho is excellent. It always tastes the same and does not disappoint. Ambiance is the usual mom and pop Vietnamese restaurant. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets away from Spring Mountain Road in Las Vegas.  I would definitely return because 1) it is close to my house and I don't have to drive 20 miles to the city 2) it is clean and 3) the staff are friendly.    As far as pho goes, it is ok."}
{"text":"Coming from Orange County, we had a lot of excellent Pho choices in Westminster which was about 15 minutes away.  We had been searching for a pho spot here in Las Vegas with no luck.  I'm impressed with the pho broth here.  It actually made it on the pho scale where you can rate it.  Compared to OC Pho, it's an ok pho place.  Here in Las Vegas so far for us, it's 1 number.  We only wish it was closer to us, since we're off by Rhodes Ranch.    It's clean and good service here.  We came around 2 PM, there were about 5 other tables here.  We're looking forward to coming here when we make a trip out this way."}
{"text":"Pho' is one of my favorite dishes. I Love their food & service! My husband & I frequently dine there."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my pho. Wife got a noodle salad that was cold, I don't know of she realized it was going to be cold. She ate it anyways and said it was good. Ambiance wasn't anything spectacular. Seating was fast and service was prompt"}
{"text":"I have been in search for good Pho and so happy that I have found it.  Tastes great, good service, reasonable prices.  I have tried multiple Vietnamese restaurants around the area and this is the most consistent with everything - never disappointed."}
{"text":"We were a little concerned when we drove up at 730pm and there where no other customers. Our concerns went away when we received our food. We ordered summer rolls and pho. Both delicious. Also, while we were there customer after customer started streaming through the doors. By the time we left half the tables were filled with customers. Guess we just hit at the slow time :)"}
{"text":"PHO OFH RETARDS. Writing this at Pho. Absolutely terrible service in fact one of the worst places I've ever been. It's full of retards, I didn't know if we sat on are own or escorted.  My lemonade was brought with a spoon in it no straw, not to sure if it's a Vietnamese thing or what. The food however is absolutely fantastic and delicious. Great food with terrible service is better than terrible food with great service.  I finally got a refill at the end of my meal and instead of replacing it with lemonade they gave me water."}
{"text":"Not bad in ambiance and price was not high. I enjoyed the spicy lemongrass and jalepeno chicken I chose. I would eat here again. Service was fine."}
{"text":"Pho MaiLan was really good tonight. I called ahead and was told my order would be ready in 10-15 minutes. I showed up 20 minutes later and my order hadn't been started yet. I was a little annoyed but then they explained to me that they didn't have any more chicken broth available and waited to ask me if the beef broth was okay. I appreciated the gesture and sat to wait for my pho. About 10 minutes later I have my to-go order of chicken and mixed vegetable with no noodles, just as I ordered. Flavor, size, and price were all exactly as I'd expect. Hopefully next time they have chicken broth available."}
{"text":"Was craving Pho, why is Henderson so void of such joints? Anyway, drove out from the southeast side in some pretty hideous traffic and we were both pretty crabby by the time we got there. They totally made up for it by being fabulous.  It's a strip mall restaurant, but not small. Clean, well lit, with nicely modern decor. Eclectic music (from Vietnamese romantic singing to Frank Sinatra to what sounded like French chipmunks - haven't decided if that's a plus or minus). The waitstaff was friendly and efficient. Prices on par. Plenty of selection in and out of Pho.  We ordered Vietnamese coffee and spring rolls. Both safe, both yummy. On to more complex.  I went ahead with the \"famous\" spicy soup - seasoned beef broth, rice noodles, flank steak, tripe, tendons, and that weird spam-like beef substance that these things come with. Got my plate of sprouts, cabbage, jalapenos, and limes nice and early. When the soup came out, my first sip of broth was pure heaven. It made Jim cry & chug water, which means it was spicy enough for me, but not overdone.  Jim got a chicken satay. Perfectly marinated. I got a bite, but that's all he'd offer, lol.  I did have to ask for cilantro and basil, but he brought it out right away, freshly washed and plentiful. Enough to make my soup orgasmic and have enough left over for omelets in the morning.  Totally worth the drive, will be back."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery via Postmates and was very impressed! Everything was beautiful and absolutely delicious! They are my new FAVORITE go to for Pho nights! A+"}
{"text":"Basic beef pho hit the spot on a cool evening along with tofu salad roll - fresh and tasty - suitable for my wife's avoidance of meat.  The menu is ranging for most any palate and the entire restaurant is spotless.  Nice people run the place and the prices are consistent with others of its type.  Proximity to my home in Anthem makes it a new \"go-to\" spot."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and ordered something new and was surprised by the flavor and meat in the stew !! Awesome tastes like a mother's cooking in the back !!!"}
{"text":"This is PHO-tastic.  I really enjoyed this place.  1.  All the Pho here is very good. No need to discuss the PHO menu as it is going to be personal to you. If you want chicken, tofu, veggies, different meats. If you want well cooked meats or odd meats (Tendons, tripe) it is all available and up to you. All you need to do to order a great PHO is to just figure out the meat you want...  2.  Broth - tasty, clear, nice.  I tend to like a bit more of the green onion and bits floating around adding to the taste.  3.  Other Dishes - Had the spring rolls and they were very nice.  Had the barbeque ribs as well and they were tasty.  4.  Drinks- The green tea ice tea is very light and an odd color, yet it has a subtle taste.  If you like soda from fountain instead of can or bottle, this is the place.  5.  Ambiance - very nice, bright, plenty of room. I kinda did not like the serving trays that hold the condiments as these seemed a bit dusty and collecting bits of stuff in it.  DONT look in it. Otherwise, very clean and nice.  I say check this place out and enjoy it."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, atmosphere is nice and clean, and most importantly service is really good!!"}
{"text":"New crew tonight. Staff seems out of sorts. Ordered a 33, nope none, okay I'll have a Tiger, nope, okay make it a Corona, sorry none are cold. Opted for the B18, grilled beef and onions. Dish came, no onions. Asked for some and though they did bring a plate, was told the B18 no longer includes grilled onion... Very odd."}
{"text":"Food was great but the service was awful enough that I feel awkward to ask what I need smh .."}
{"text":"Menu was simple and selection was good. The $6 small egg rolls were on the expensive side but they made up for the value in the large pho for only $9. Service was attentive and food was ok. No complaints here."}
{"text":"Delicious Pho! The broth was perfect - so yummy.  The round steak was tender and flavorful.  The portions are larger than normal - so a small bowl was perfect for me.   I also tried the calamari which was so yummy! I loved the batter - more of a beer batter than usual - i dig.   For beverages - our whole table got the club soda limeaide? It was so refreshing. Specially in combination with the hot steamy soup.   The service was also particularly nice - I'm not used to being greeted with so many smiles at a Pho restaurant. I felt very welcome.   I wish this wasn't so far away - I would definitely be a regular!"}
{"text":"I ordered p3 which is pho with well done beef and flank. The broth was very flavorful and it came with a lot of green onions and cilantro which I like. I ordered the small and finished the whole bowl. If you have a bigger appetite definitely order the large size. It's a dollar difference but I'm not sure how much more they gave you. Overall I liked this place. It fulfilled my noodle craving and is especially good after a long night out. Next time I'll definitely try more things on the menu.   My friend ordered their bun bo hue. She liked it and said it was pretty spicy. Didn't get to try but it did look yummy."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their Pho is the best in town! I've had pho in other restaurants but they don't compare to Pho MaiLan. It's all in the broth...the layers of flavor are amazing! Clean, friendly establishment and consistently great food and service!"}
{"text":"Great pho soup!!  Combo bahn mi sandwich was phenomenal! It had plenty of meat. They also don't skimp out on amount of shrimp in pho noodle soups.  Great service As well! Overall great experience!!"}
{"text":"Best pho I've ever had. Egg rolls were amazing too. Home made lemonade and coffee. Staff is extremely friendly. Great place to bring kids for dinner"}
{"text":"Pho weather season is in full effect and lately I've been craving pho like crazy. I came here after a hard days work but I didn't appreciate the service I received, especially after a stressful intense work day.   I came in and all the booths on the left were full. I proceeded to the bathroom to wash my hands and then tried to seat myself elsewhere. No wait staff to be found hence the fact I figured I would just seat myself. Plenty of tables were left dirty and the three booths in the other side dirty as well. I figured if I would just park it in the middle of the three Someone would clear the table for me. A man proceeds to ask me to move to another table because it was dirty I said no I'd like to sit here I'll wait so he said it would be a few minutes. He starts to clean the other tables far from me first and waits for me last. I know I could have sat somewhere else but it was cold and I was tired and I would have rather sat at a booth. When he finally gets to my table he cleans it quick and walks away. Moments later comes back drops a menu and walks away. No one has greeted me said hi, how are you? Nothing! He comes back and asks \"are you ready\" and I said \"I'll have the pho tai please\" he said ok and walked away.  Returned with water and walked away. No words being said. It's just a bit awkward. Walking away is a pretty common thing they do here at Pho Mailan. Shortly after placing my order a woman drops off my pho and walks away. Not even placing it in front of me. She places it in the middle of the table. I thought ok kind of weird but it was because she was grabbing the condiments for the pho which she dropped off again on the other side of the table and again walked away. Not even asking if I needed something else or if I'm doing ok. Nothing. I mean I didn't need anything else but it's the thought that counts. I actually did need a fork because my chopstick skills aren't the best. She smiled when I asked and brought it quickly. There was one gentlemen who asked if I was doing ok and that was much appreciated.   I'm giving two stars based on service but the pho alone could easily be a 4 star review. Very flavorful broth serves with a generous helping of both meat and noodles presented beautifully with onion, scallion and cilantro. I like to keep my broth pretty plain and add just a squirt of lemon and let the broth stand alone. In my option a good bowl of pho doesn't need much. I was enjoying my pho throughly until I found a shrimp tail at the bottom of my bowl. What if I was allergic?    Other than the sucky service this place has delicious pho and is sure to fix my pho craving when I'm need. I would still come back even though they're flat out rude. Maybe it was just an off day for them. We'll see next time."}
{"text":"I drove by Pho MaiLan all the time going home. This is located on Eastern and Sunridge Heights. And finally i just decided to give this place a try.  I give it a thumbs up!  This is a Vietnamese noodle house.  I ordered the pork with vermicelli and it came with the noodles.  The portions are pretty big it filled me up pretty quickly.  The pork and the noodles were awesome! The pork was marinated to perfection and it was not chewy or tough. It was just perfect along with the vermicelli. The noodles were nice and fresh along with the veggies that came with it. You can tell everything was just cooked and not sitting in the fridge for a long time.  I also ordered the fresh Vietnamese roll. That too was really good. Inside the fresh wrapped were veggies and vermicelli. You dip the rolls into this peanut butter base type sauce, which is mmmm mmmmm gooood!  Overall:  The service is great they filled your water up and did not have to be told.  They have free Wifi so if you wanted to get some work done you can.  This place is nice and quiet , really relaxing, different from those loud Pho places.  I highly recommend this place. This is a must try.   This goes on my top list of Vietnamese places to eat."}
{"text":"I'm stoked that there is a Vietnamese restaurant close to home! This restaurant is clean and is family owned. They are very attentive and friendly, which is a huge plus compared to similar restaurants.  I ordered the Bun Bo Hue, which is my second time trying this dish.  I was not disappointed at all. I like how they do not use the pork blood in this dish.  Chris ordered the beef pho with rare steak and he enjoyed it, but said he had better (3/5).  We also loveee spring rolls with peanut sauce, so of course we try it at every vietnamese place we go to.  We liked it and will probably always order that when we come back, plus it's $3.95 (i think).  I will definitely come back and try the bun thit nuong (sp?), another one of my vietnamese faves.  *oh I ordered thai tea*, but I guess I learned my mistake from ordering a thai drink from a vietnamese restaurant.  It tasted different and obviously not authentic. It still tasted decent, but I wouldn't recommend it.   I'll try coconut juice next time."}
{"text":"Great place to go for casual dining. Food is always great. They serve large portions for great prices."}
{"text":"Right across from my house and it's a great go to restaurant ! The pho has a lot of vegetables and the broth is really flavorful! Prices are very reasonable and service is friendly!"}
{"text":"Banh Mi without cilantro?? Blasphemy!!  I was craving a good banh mi sandwich & after yelping for banh mi in Henderson, I found this Vietnamese restaurant that I had somehow previously overlooked. I had hubby pick up 3 sandwiches on his way home from work; the grilled marinated pork, the grilled marinated beef & the grilled chicken. The sandwiches themselves were pretty good although the meat is def not typical of what you get in a banh mi but more of what you would order on top of rice. The veggies were also a little over marinated for my taste.  The biggest oversight though in my opinion, was the complete lack of cilantro. Wha??? That's prob my favorite part of the all mighty banh mi.  The other issue was they said it would be 20-30 mins but when hubby got there right at 15 mins, they were sitting on the counter waiting for us which led to slightly soggy sandwiches.  I would prob order from them again but I will def be sure to ask for the cilantro next time & arrive earlier & take my chances with a short wait."}
{"text":"Love it! It's such a cute, delicious restaurant! It's decorated very modern and it's super clean! The waiters are very nice and they check up on you to see if you're enjoying your food & if you need anything else, but they're not all over your shoulder and checking up every second. The prices are very good & for five people, our total was only $30! Being a vegan, I only got their Tofu Summer Rolls - but they were so yummy! I also got the Young Coconut Drink, and it was sooo delicious, and they kept it in the actual coconut! And then after I was done drinking it, they cut it in half so I could eat the actual coconut. My family loved the Pho and said it was the best they ever had. The restaurant isn't crowded, and everything is clean and on point. For anyone in the area, I definitely recommend it! :)"}
{"text":"Heard this place was new and wanted to see if it was any good. The atmosphere was a little bit different then most Pho restaurant and gave customers a more modern feel. I ordered the Pho with just beef and it tasted okay but it took forever for the food to come. All in all I would try them again and a different plate !! : )"}
{"text":"The best pho in Henderson! The owner is so kind and welcoming and so are the rest of the employees. I have tried many different items from the menu and have not yet been disappointed. Service is quick and its even great to-go! It is definitely worth the try and prices are great."}
{"text":"Love this place, i have come here at least twice a month since they have open and yet to have an inconsistent experience. It is always on point. Came last week with 12 very hungover Club Crawlers, and we litterally ordered Half of their huge menu, we put this resto to the test, and they passed with flying colors!"}
{"text":"Most worst service and food ever!!!! Super slow, if they don't have enough servers I would understand, but there are 3 servers and 1 cashier to service the whole restaurant with less than 20 tables. With less than 10 tables of customers they are already slow like this, I can't imagine what would happen if they are full house. Perhaps they need to hire more servers or just shut the damn thing down. Didn't get a chance to mention the food was NOT authentic at all!!! Would NOT ever come again!!!!"}
{"text":"This pho place is the best pho restaurant I have ever been to. Their food is so delicious and their service is always on point! The dinning area is really spacious, clean, and the decor is like any other pho restaurant but very fancy looking LOL I always get their spring rolls and their shrimp pho, price is reasonable (roughly around $8 for a bowl) and portions is good enough to satisfy you. This pho restaurant is definitely a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"The color combinations used with the interior decorations is far from your typical Vietnamese/ Asian design. I went with my mom and got the vermicelli noodles, with chicken, eggrolls & vermicelli noodles, with grill pork, eggrolls with the cold sauce that goes on top. The meat was well seasoned but a bit chewy. However, the lettuce, bean sprouts, and cucumbers they put inside were green and fresh. We also ordered chicken wings that were served with a sweet chili sauce. They put pepper in their flour batter that gave it a kick. They give you 20% off your whole menu as part of a promo they are running. Definitely take advantage of the promo! Other than the food that made me give them 3 stars, they had this asian sound clip that was about 20 seconds long that kept replaying, and it was loud too! By the end of the day, it was still stuck in my head! LOL"}
{"text":"This place has got to be the cleanest Vietnamese restaurant, hands down! The staff are always so welcoming. I usually get pho with lean meat and extra bean sprouts and they give more than expected. I can't say I love the broth but the cleanliness, customer service, and thai tea compensate for it. Definitely a place to cure a hangover or a cold. =)"}
{"text":"The pho was awful today. Noodles were not thoroughly cooked through leaving it dry and broth was not that hot either. They also skimped on meat, hardly any in there. I know it's lunch special but I used to get a decent portion. Also I came in 10 mins before 5pm which is when their lunch special ends. When I realized that they skimped back on their noodles and meat, obviously I needed another bowl to satisfy my craving. When I ordered another bowl, they charged me full price. They ran out of basil on me, boy just an all around whammy today. Should of just gone to Canes. Never again.   Still don't understand how they got a banner hanging outside saying best Pho, who voted? Questionable."}
{"text":"Wow... I can't even come close to expressing how happy I am to find this place. I just moved here from CT and there was only 1 place in all of the state that was worth eating pho at. I had to drive all the way to Boston or NY for good pho. I've tried lemongrass, there service was typical Vietnamese service(order, eat your food and get out) and their food was not even close to being good enough to deal with poor service to come back. Been to pho Annie's and pho Kim long.... some dishes were good, but if you're talking about pho or bun bo hue nothing is like Pho Mailan. I've given up all hopes of finding a good pho place, but then the Pho gods delivered an UNBELIEVABLY GREAT ONE instead. Let's just say I cried a little while eating my meal and followed it up by walking into parked car after leaving bc I was in heaven and didn't notice the fixed hunk of metal I was gonna walk into. Walking into a parked chevy did not damper my just then incredible pho experience one bit. Oh and talk about great customer service... THEY HAVE THAT DOWN PACKED!!! Going back right after this review. I went 2 days ago. Hehe :-)"}
{"text":"Try the noodle dishes if it's too hot for Pho. They are well seasoned pieces of chicken and shrimp and quite tasty."}
{"text":"This WAS my go to place! Food was amazing service was great! But... That's all changed now I'll just keep it short.. Well try to! lol .. 1st. We went in and we ordered our usual (we've been coming to mailan for a little over a year) the server was some guy we never saw and he kept telling us we couldn't order a half order of egg rolls we kept telling him that we always get it so he finally said ok and walked away. When he came back he had a FULL ORDER of egg rolls!! Get it together new guy!! 2nd. It's one thing to have a sh*t ton of gnats flying around your restaurant but when I take a bite of my pho and a huge fly comes floating to the top of the bowl that's out of control!! 3rd. We will NEVER be back especially after reading that there was a dead roach on a damn table!! Fix your bug issues!!  GROSS! Seriously guys you are messing up! I hope you get it together for your future customers! GOOD LUCK. The only good thing they have going is the server Thi!! He should leave there himself to somewhere better!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night and ordered  1. Crispy spring rolls, 6 2. Pho Tai Chin, 7 3. Bun Nem Nuong Thit Nuong, 8 For $26  - Nice seating. Spacious. - Can't speak to servers in Viet, but I liked Ryan's attempt to figure out what we ordered. He did have to come back and confirm our order after he went to the kitchen. He still forgot to take out the onions in the pho, but I guess it was our fault to test how authentic this place is. Haha. Great guy! Friendly.  - Fried egg rolls similar to the restaurants in China town. Better than Lemon Grass.  - The grilled pork and vermicelli was delicious. Yummy grilled taste. Fresh vegetables. Smaller than average sized portion.  - Average sized pho portion. Tender beef but lacked in quantity. Broth was good.  - Can't wait to come back during their HH.  - Quite possible the BEST in Henderson! Better pricing/quality compared to others in town."}
{"text":"I really like this Vietnamese restaurant. The food is always good, service is always friendly and the place is always clean...and doesn't smell funky. I used to come here a lot when my office was still in Anthem. I would always get a bowl of pho or grilled pork chop.  Pho: I normally get a bowl of pho with any of the following: brisket, flank, and steak. The broth is excellent. They have different combinations including one with salmon. 5/5  Summer Rolls: Shrimp, pork, vermicelli, and greens wrapped in rice paper. The 2 rolls are cut in half and served with a peanut dipping sauce. 5/5  Roasted Pork Spring Rolls: Roasted pork, vermicelli, and greens wrapped in rice paper.  Again, the 2 rolls are cut in half and served with a peanut dipping sauce. The pork slices have that grilled taste to them. 5/5  Bun Dac Biet: Fried egg rolls, grilled pork, pork sausage, grilled shrimp, cucumbers, bean sprouts, and peanuts on top of vermicelli. You get that vinegar + fish sauce on the side. My friend who absolutely hates egg rolls loved it. 5/5  The service here is always great. I joke around with the employees. In general, the place is clean but sometimes it takes them a while to clear out tables."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE.  They have the best Bun Bo Hue in town!!!!  Everyone needs to try it. I come here to get Bun Bo Hue AT LEAST once in two weeks.  Their service is amazing. At times, the waitress/waiter forgets to pour water, but overall it's great.  If this place ever goes out of business (knock on wood), I am going to cry.  My favorite place to get Pho and Bun Bo Hue!"}
{"text":"The are very timely on the pick up orders and the food is seperated so that my noodles don't get soggy. A place with great tasting food as well!"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese place in town. It's clean and tidy. They have almost everything you could think of. Good service as well. My personal favorites include their chicken and veggie phos and their grilled steaks. Great appetizers as well. Although, I don't recommend the fried calamari."}
{"text":"I have tried many different pho places and I must say this is my favorite one!  I usually order grilled pork plate, i think (the thin slices of meat). But anyways, it had a unique taste to it very different than the ones I usually had.  The food was very flavorful and it has a hint of spice to it.  I dont normally like spicy food, but this hint of spice was just enough to make me enjoy the flavors of it.  The servers are pretty good and friendly. The prices are decent and its worth spending on :]"}
{"text":"Normally, Pho in an upscale area is a rare occurrence. Then add the fact that the place is bright, spotless, and got an A grade by the health department makes it almost unreal for a Vietnamese restaurant. By no means am I criticizing the businesses of my people, but most of the places I use to frequent in LA were C grade.  Pho MaiLan is a breathe of fresh air. The open feel and spread out dining area is a welcoming touch.   To start my friend and I got an order of spring rolls ($4.95). They were two fat rolls filled with lettuce, mint, noodles, boiled pork, and shrimp. It was nice to bite into them and not come out with a mouthful of noodles. The peanut sauce comes with pickled daikon and carrots. It tastes even better with a spoonful of the chili sauce.   Instead of getting Pho, I saw that they had a vermicelli rice noodle bowl filled with all my favorites. The Bun MaiLan Dac Biet ($8.50) was the perfect way to try a little of everything. The lemongrass pork was tender, flavorful, and plenty. If that was not enough, there was an eggroll, two pieces of grilled meat, a couple of shrimp, a mound of lettuce, mint leaves, and more pickled vegetables. It comes with a side bowl of Nuoc Mam. Spoon some over the whole dish, mix up, and it is a meal only a notch under my mom's level. Everyone is biased towards what we grow up with. My only complaint was that the meats were more on the salty side. My friend took a bite of it and said that he might forgo getting the Pho Dac Biet ( Regular $6.95) one day and order this instead. That in itself is an amazing feat, because he will spend a whole day hanging out at the house when my dad makes Pho and eat 4 bowls before the day end.  We also got a Banh Mi Thit Nuong to go for a friend. The meat came in a generous portion. It kept it's warm and tenderness for quite some time. The lean meat and filling were good, but the bread needs more of a crunch. It was too doughy for my taste. It is more expensive than most places costing around $5, but the meat alone is worth it."}
{"text":"I was not impressed in any way with this Pho. The broth, in my opinion, was not good. The broth kind of makes or breaks it and this one was unenjoyable. The service was equally unimpressive. Surprised to see so many glowing reviews. We could even not finish our soup."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Pho MaiLan. Given some other Henderson/LV failures, I wasnt sure how good Vietnamese was going to be outside of the Spring Mountain area. Luckily the food here is spot on. Good quality, good portion sizes, decent ambiance. As others have said the service leaves something to be desired. Pretty obnoxious to be watching your server texting at a table when you need something, but I can overlook this for good pho."}
{"text":"Service is always wonderful here. They greet you right away and you can sit wherever you would like. The restaurant itself seems very clean and set up nicely. I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 because the food is tasty but if I'm comparing to other Vietnamese restaurants around town, I would have to say it's mediocre. The broth is a bit on the watery side and so is their siracha on the tables. They also pack way too much lettuce into their fresh spring rolls in order to make it appear more full. The prices are fair though and I'm actually a fan of their Asian chicken wings. I would still say to give it a try yourself."}
{"text":"Since I'm from Los Angeles, where there are tons of excellent Vietnamese and pho restaurants, perhaps what I consider average or good is skewed, here in Vegas? I haven't tried any other Vietnamese restaurants in Las Vegas yet, just Pho MaiLan.  The most off-putting thing about this restaurant was the service. The servers were OK (meaning, they seemed pleasant and indifferent*), but the service was almost non existent since they didn't seem to notice us when we entered or check on us when we were having our meal. (I wasn't wearing my invisibility cloak! Oy.) I had to flag down the servers to get any service, even to just get the menus.**   *Note 1: The workers were warm and friendly to one regular customer who entered to pickup his takeout order. But, they seemed apathetic to all the other customers.  **Note 2: The restaurant was at 20% occupancy when we arrived (around 5:30pm).   My dining companion and I both ordered pho dac biet. The food was average fare one would get at any given ordinary pho place...although, it tasted blander than average. (Side note: The customers were mostly non Vietnamese, myself included.)  The place looked clean and the standard pho restaurant condiments were provided at every table, which was nice: salt, pepper, sriracha sauce, hoisin sauce, and chili pepper sauce. I wanted a sauce dish, but didn't even want to bother wasting my energy flagging down the servers again for that, so I just used the plate beneath my pho bowl. (Although I had plenty of energy to write this review.)  Here is my ratings breakdown:  Ambiance and Cleanliness: 4 out of 5 stars (better than the average pho place)  Service: 0 out of 5 stars (Out of service! I have received far better service from fastfood drive-throughs.)  Food: 2.75 out of 5 stars (bland and ordinary)  VERDICT: It wasn't horrible, It was just EH. On a 1-10 scale, I give it a 4.5 (mediocre). On the star scale, I give it a 2.75 out of 5."}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant! Our waitress was very nice and quickly brought lime infused ice water (very refreshing)!  We ordered fried spring rolls, a beef baguette sandwich and an egg noodle soup...all was delicious and reasonably priced!  Will stop by this place again! :-)"}
{"text":"Update: We usually go for lunch, but tonight decided to go for dinner. There are apparently a couple new servers. The one we got has no business being a server anywhere. Ever. Even the chef in the back expressed his discontent by ringing the bell several times when her dishes were not picked up. She was completely apathetic and incompetent, tossing the spoons down where they landed (together), not placing one at each setting. She looked utterly confused taking our order. I can't understand why she was hired!  This said, our favorite server Thai (not sure if I'm spelling his name right) came to the rescue, and fixed everything without us even having to ask!  The reason I updated this review is for those of you who got the new girl on your first visit. Please do not judge the restaurant by her. I can't imagine she will last. Go back and ask for Thai.    Fantastic experience every single time. The pho is our favorite in town, and everything else is fresh and delicious. The staff always goes above and beyond, the owner is very attentive and always has a smile. Do yourself a favor, and eat here. You won't be disappointed! We come 3-4 times a month.  Yeah.  We have a bit of an addiction!!"}
{"text":"Solid Vietnamese. Family-friendly and excellent service. While they seem to have phenomenal pho with up to 7 kinds of meat, I actually didn't try any. In any case, their other food was bomb! On their rice vermicelli menu, Bun Dac Biet (B1) was a total meat fiesta with savory grilled marinated shrimp, pork sausage, and sliced pork and a fried egg roll that seemed like a bonus! Then their Banh Mi Bo Nuong (BM3) with grilled marinated beef brightened with carrot/daikon slaw and cilantro on a bun was so good I didn't want to share! Then my whole fam really enjoyed their Com Ga Nuong (C7)- fried rice full of little veggies topped with super juicy grilled marinated chicken.   From start to finish, service was amazing! In fact, we forgot our doggie bag and our server came out in scorching 110-degree weather to find us in the parking lot. Get your Vietnom-nom on!"}
{"text":"Great food, good prices.  Will hit this place again when I come back to sin city!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. They forgot about my order, so I ended up waiting a long time for my pho. I was starving. Won't be coming back and won't be referring others. Still got charged full price for the pho they forgot about until I reminded them about it."}
{"text":"I am visiting Vegas and wanted something fresh, so I came here.  The service was great and the place was clean.  I was happy to know they had some vegan options, but they were a bit bland. For example, the spring rolls could have used some carrots or other vegetable. The vermicelli dish could have used another vegetable, or a different sauce (it came with soy sauce). The specialties seem to be meat based, so, perhaps their meat food has more flavor?"}
{"text":"Best pho restaurant in town I must say! I've been here a couple times and they have never did me wrong. Every visit was always perfect! Food is always amazing. The restaurant itself is clean and looks unique. Service is always quick and on point in my opinion. If you want a eat somewhere and you're in a hurry to go somewhere afterwards I would recommend coming here! Thank you Pho Mailan!"}
{"text":"This place has the best pho, I even got my husband into it! Prices are so cheap, I'm not sure how this place stays open. Cute and clean decor, and the crispy spring rolls are tasty. Nom nom!"}
{"text":"I always go to Pho Saigon8 for my Vietnamese cravings, but this time, I thought... why not give Pho MaiLan another shot since it's been a while since I've been there & technically, it's closer to my house.  I called to place a togo order.  I spoke to a gentleman and I ordered the Summer Rolls and the bun cha gio thit nuong (sliced pork & eggroll vermicelli).  I also asked for a side of \"hot sauce\" to go since I like my food spicy.  I was told that it'll take 15 minutes.    30 minutes later, I entered Pho MaiLan.  I was greeted by a server and I told him I have a pick-up order.  He walked me to the register and said, \"Summer Roll, Bun, and a soup, right?!\"    \"No -- no soup for me,\" I said.    \"No?  You didn't order soup?  Are you sure?\"  \"Yes, I am sure.  I asked for extra hot sauce though.\"  \"Oh?  It sounded like you said you wanted a small pho when you called.  And I figured you meant you wanted small soup.  So, are you sure you don't want the soup?  It's only $1.\"  \"Yes, I'm sure ... I just want the fresh rolls, my noodles, and hot sauce please.\"  \"The soup is only $1.  Are you sure you don't want the soup?!\"  SERIOUSLY?!!!      By this time, I was getting irritated.  \"Listen, I do NOT want soup even if it's a dollar.  If I wanted soup, I would have ordered soup.  So, please,... can I just pay for my order?\"    He took my payment and disappeared.  10 minutes later, there was still no sign of him.  I was baffled because first, I was told my food would be ready in 15 minutes but it's been well over 30 minutes since I walked in.  The restaurant was not even busy so what's taking him so long?!     As I'm hovering by the cash register, an article on the wall caught my eye... it reads...  DRAB SERVICE MARS A GOOD MEAL at Pho Mailan by AL MANCINI (http://lasvegascitylife.com/sections/eat-drink/dining-out/review-drab-service-mars-good-meal-pho-mailan.html).  This article was printed on May 8, 2013.  After reading the article, I shook my head.  Why the heck would the Management team frame this article and post this proudly in their restaurant?!  Is it to warn the customers that their service has NOT improved at all since 2013 and that we should just deal with it?!  Could it be the same server who help Al Mancini with HIS order?!  LOL!    Finally, another waitress passed by and I stopped her to inquire about my togo order.  A minute later, she came back with my order and said, \"Here you go!  Sorry for the wait.\"  Whatever happened to the dude who took my order?!  Maybe he was pissed I didn't want the soup?!   Oh - yeah,... the food.  The Summer Rolls were good.  The bun... Meh!  The sliced pork were salty and fatty.  I think I should drive further to Saigon 8 next time."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get pho but don't go after 8:00 PM because they're all in a hurry to leave. For example, the utensils were just all dropped in the middle of the table. I could write a whole list but I won't do that lol. We've even witnessed them turn people away even before 8:30. Other than that, when I'm craving pho, I come here."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our lunch here quite a lot. Clean, bright and spacious dining area. Friendly and efficient staff. The pho was excellent and the sandwich bread was awesome, light and tasty. The summer rolls did have an unusually large amount of vegetable but I like it like that, it was like having a salad before my soul. Very happy and would recommend anytime."}
{"text":"It's a clean, cozy restaurant with friendly staff and reasonable prices. BUT they have ONE vegetarian option on their menu, fried tofu, and their pho is either beef or chicken based soup which isn't vegetarian friendly at all. Won't be returning!"}
{"text":"Place was nice and clean and food was not bad.  Service was confusing because I did not know who really was our server.  Intentions were good, helping each other, but if I ask for something twice from two people you would think I will get it from one of them but I didn't.  Third time's the charm though! So good food, service ok."}
{"text":"The location and service are great. The food unfortunately was lacking in flavor. I hate adding salt to my food but there was really no choice. We ate Pho custom bolws with round eye, flank and tripe... I also ordered broccoli with it but it never came. We had the fried egg rolls too and had the same issue it lacked flavor. Sorry I wont be back I will stick with my spot Pho Saigon 8. I guess I will deal with bad service for great food."}
{"text":"This place use to be a 5 and I loved it. This is my 3rd times in a row that it's been bad. I returned the meal tonight; soggy noodles and the four slivers meat were 98% fat. So disgusting."}
{"text":"Great pho!!! Especially if you live in NYC with absolutely no authentic pho to eat!!!!!"}
{"text":"ok. I've been a regular here for about a year now and have had nothing but great food and service. I'm not sure what's happening but they better fix it. QUICK.   service has been spotty for the last month and my last visit was the last straw. we came in and were led to a table by the window. a table that had a belly up roach on it. we were all kinda shocked and just stared at it. we called the server over and he was about to pick it up!! with his fingers!!! he must have thought about it and then used his rag. he started to walk away and almost like an after-though asked us if we wanted to sit at another table. uh YEA!   we ordered our usuals and waited. I started to look around and noticed the place was not as clean as it normally was. debris was building up along the edge of the window by the floor in the back. dirt was also accumulating under the booths, which was in plain eye view from my table.  our orders came and my extra noodles on the side were about half of what they used to serve. great... and my basil looked like it had seen better days. one of my meat pieces tasted not so good and my tendon was HARD and had an off taste.   overall this place itself looked like it had seen better days also. WHAT'S GOING ON PhoMailan???? we were huge fans, but it seems like since the manager (I think it was the manager) has been gone it has not been the same.  it takes a lot for me to put it out there like this and \"one star\" a business, but come on.  fix the problem."}
{"text":"I had a terrific banh mi sandwich, a vietnamese coffee and a fruit and coconut milk, fruit and ice dessert.  All these things were delicious.  My sweetie said his pho was ok but not great.  My friend didn't eat much of her meal, a dish consisting of beef, crispy noodles and veggies.  She said it was good hot but in a few minutes it had cooled and was tasteless and uninteresting.  The waiter said it was his first day and seemed very nervous.  This place seems fine if you order the right things off the menu."}
{"text":"I go here from time to time as it's close to my work. Food is exceptional, service is good and place is clean. I can recommend this place."}
{"text":"Come try their noodle bowls! We always get an a6 and a b11!! Their spring rolls (a6) are so yummy!!! The peanut dipping sauce...I could lick the bowl clean.   Their chicken pho is a little on the bland side but you cannot beat this place for good service and yummy food!!"}
{"text":"I happened across this place while looking up Pho restaurants in Vegas. I haven't heard good things about the chains here (especially because several had been shut down for food-safety violations). So I decided to try this place for some Pho. And I'm SO glad I did. The management here is welcoming and the service was great!  Upon entering the smell is amazing. I just wanted some takeout but decided to stay the smell was so good. I decided upon a few things; chicken satay, the pork cabbage rolls, a chicken bahn mi sandwich, the seafood pho, and the husband had the beef brisket pho (all shared between 2 adults and 3 kids). EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING. I have picky eaters, and my kids tried, and liked, everything they ate here.  The sandwich was flavorful, the pork rolls were juicy (and the peanut sauce was the bomb - even though I have always hated it!). However, the pho stole the show. Flavorful broth, tender meat, and delicious veggies. And the price tag on the food we ordered? $35. I will be frequenting this place again. And again. And again."}
{"text":"When in Henderson/Green Valley stop by! Really chill atmosphere & modern decor, friendly staff, & great food! I haven't had a bad dish yet & that says a lot! Everything is delicious!"}
{"text":"REALLY GOOD!! I wasn't sure what to expect from a place that there's not too much request for in nevada (in my opinion), but it was really delicious. Hubbz and I ordered to go and it was literally ready in about 5 minutes. I'm not sure if that's the same time frame if you sit down.  Either way its a MUST try."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love Vietnamese and wanted to try somewhere new. I looked at a lot of reviews and picked Mai lan because it sounded like people enjoyed it and the pictures were nice.   When we got there it wasn't very busy and were seating in a booth. I was looking forward to my vegetable pho, as I am vegan, and it was brought to my attention they don't over vegetable broth!! I use to love ramen but its only chicken or beef broth offered so I converted to a pho lover! I'm very disappointed to hear they don't offer this because traditional pho is vegetable broth or so I've been told. Instead of pho I was suggested to try another noodle dish offered except it didn't have broth and was cold. I think it was call bun, but I may be wrong.  It was cheap for what you got and the staff was kind. Ill be going somewhere else next time"}
{"text":"This place is a very good pho place. My fiancé highly recommended it and when we went there it exceeded expectations! We each had pho and we left stuffed. If your in the area check it out!"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant. Fresh taste. Diligent staff. And my God the broth was legit. My gf was upset they didn't have vegetarian broth (only beef broth), but I thought what they did have was outstanding."}
{"text":"After seeing so many of my friends posting pics of yummy looking pho to their facebook pages, I finally convinced my boyfriend to be adventurous and try it out with me since a new Pho restaurant opened up near us.  This used to be EVOS, a place I was sad to see go. But, they retained the clean, fresh ambience. It looked nice, maybe a bit too bright for my liking. I am sure I would have enjoyed my experience more in the dark as a matter of fact because my dish looked less than appealing.  About that dish, I told the nice waiter that we were very excited that this was our first experience with pho and asked if he could point us in the right direction for ordering. He picked something for us on the first page of the menu and said it's what everyone orders and we are sure to love it. I am going to attach an image of what he brought out. It was not what I expected at all, especially after seeing others images of pho that had more veggies and lighter looking noodles. I certainly didn't expect a hoof looking thing (others have commented that it looks more like a cervix) along with lots of grissle to arrive in my bowl of faux pho.   Because the service was so good, we decided not to say anything. And decided to pretend we were in Vietnam and that this must be traditional pho, whereas what other have been eating elsewhere must be the modernized version. I have since learned from someone who has eaten pho in Vietnam that what I ate didn't look like the pho she had in her travels. Oh well.  I really did love the service at this restaurant though. They were very attentive and nice. I'm thinking I just ordered the wrong thing? Will try out Lemongrass Cafe once I recover from this experience.  ***Update*** We should have expressed our disappointment to the staff while we were there but they were so nice that I didn't want to make them feel bad! Lesson learned. My apologies to the staff for not saying anything while we were there. I am sure they would have made good on the situation."}
{"text":"I will give this a 3.5 rating. I was craving Pho on a cold Saturday, and there isn't much up in my new Green Valley neighborhood so I make the venture up Eastern to Pho MaiLan. They have a Happy Hour from 3-6pm so I timed it right. I liked their menu, they have a lot of good selections. The restaurant itself has quite a few tables and is very nicely decorated, bright and cheery.   I ordered a Pho Tai Chin and thai iced tea, and both were delivered quickly. The Pho has a nice balance of meat and noodles, just a bit light on meat for me. The broth was also a little blah, so it required a few limes and some hoison sauce to perk it up. Served piping hot, I had to wait a bit until it was temperature ready to eat.   I would come back for sure. Its not as good as my favorite, Sidestreet Pho, but its fairly priced and decent. There's not much Pho in Henderson, so any potential business owners.....there's a goldmine out here waiting for you."}
{"text":"Came here due to high ratings. The place looks rather nice and the service was good.   I had ordered a Large Bowl of Pho and was so disappointed. I can nearly eat most Pho and say they all taste the same, but if I dislike it...that's pretty bad. In this case, Pho Mailan, you're a winner.   The meat was thick and hard to chew on. The veggie dish for our pho did not look fresh, but rather old.   Their broth was so bland, I had to add tons of hoisin sauce, but that still didn't cut it. My Brother-in-Law, however enjoyed his bowl. So out of 9 of us, 4 did not enjoy this visit. So u be the judge. He also ordered Thai Tea , but did not finished it.   I suggest ordering a small bowl to try them out before you waste your money on a large bowl. Just in case..."}
{"text":"First off, this review is for the Pho only... My friend got another dish that he really enjoyed... and from what I have read, the other reviews rave about everything EXCEPT the Pho.   The Pho wasn't BAD, just wasn't.. good. I got the flank steak and it seemed to be lacking in the soup:[. The noodles were also different and not the regular vermicelli that I am used to. Sadly the noodles were also lacking in the substance department.. are they trying to go against the grain with their different noodles?? I don't know. But I prefer the standard.   I was left with a big bowl of beef broth that wasn't all too yummy and my Pho craving wasn't all too satisfied.   To return? Yes... just not for Pho."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful!  We came in from Spokane, WA and decided to try this place from seeing other Yelp reviews.  The food was fantastic!  Very fresh and lots of flavor!  I loved  B-18 on the menu.  It was so good, we came back 2 days later to have it again.  That says a lot when you are in such a large area with so many food options.  We will be back when we come back to Vegas.  This is a Must Try food location!"}
{"text":"Been living in Henderson almost a year and had yet to try any Pho out here. Like a lot of reviewers, I'm from So Cal and worked in Orange County where there are TONS of noodle places. Needless to say, I was looking for a family-owned place with flavorful food. This is one of those places.  I ordered P4 (Pho Tai, Nam - Noodle soup with sliced round-eye steak, well-done flank) and my husband had P6 (Pho Chin, Nam - Noodle soup with well-done brisket and well-done flank) and we shared A17 (Smoked  Salmon Rolls - Smoked salmon wrapped in rice paper with mixed freshvegetable and pickles). Everything was flavorful and delicious. We got it to-go and it came packaged well with plenty of fixings for the soup. If you're someone who likes a lot of noodles in your Pho, get the Large size (same amount of broth but more noodles and fixings). The smoked salmon rolls were very fresh tasting and the peanut sauce was tasty.  Prices are very reasonable also ($8 for regular size Pho, $9 for large). We will be back!"}
{"text":"Bun Bo Hue and Hu tieu Bo Kho are both really good. Tasteful with the right ingredients and spice. This s a regular place for my wife and I."}
{"text":"Where have you been all my life ...& Why haven't I been here before!   We've been living in Henderson for over a year now and I can't believe I've never been here.(sad)  Pho MaiLan is located In a small strip mall right on the corner of Eastern Avenue and Sunridge Heights Parkway right next to Lee's liquor and I drive past this place every single day.   We walked in at about 2:30pm (on a Wednesday) & we were greeted right at the door, shown to our table and handed a menu each, Our glasses of Water were then brought out and we ordered.  Love the prompt service!!  And with a smile!! (Very friendly)  I ordered the regular (P15) Pho Ga which is a healthy and super duper flavorful chicken broth with rice noodles accompanied by a side plate of Thai basil, bamboo shoots, lime and sliced peppers.   Add all that with a splash of Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce and my mouth was in heaven!   I always dig in and drink half the soup and then eat the chicken and noodles with veggies... kid habit I guess.  The regular is a decent portion and I couldn't even finish it - so I asked for a \"to go\" container to take it home.. I didn't want to waste my Pho Ga!  So portions are awesome! I did wonder what the Large looked like.... maybe next time!  Yummy food at a great price!  Regular is $8 Large is $9  What a cheap and healthy lunch!!!  I will be back for sure and would recommend you check this ONO place out!!   Ps. Tuesday's Senior day: 10% off  Pps. HAPPY HOUR DAILY 3-5pm - Dine in only -  Appetizers and soup for only $5!!!"}
{"text":"Talk about some real vietnamese food being delivered right to your door step ( 3 mile radius, I am 7 miles away almost got turned down but talked him out of it, yessir!) Thanks to the pictures of food and the menus on yelp which helped out awhole lot. The phone order was easy and smooth. It took about an hour due to 2 deliveries before mine but well worth the wait.   We ordered the crispy fried spring rolls, Pho Tai Bo Vien, Combo vermincelli, vietnamese sausage and marinated slice pork vermincelli, and kalbi ribs with rice. The food was very fresh and really flavorful, everything was really tasty especially the broth of my pho, the kalbi ribs was the best, tender and packed with flavor.  My family and I loved every bite. We will be ordering more to come."}
{"text":"It's unassuming strip mall venue doesn't do it justice, Pho MaiLan serves up very good Vietmanese food in a market that offers very little options. The soup and rolls are great, but the meat is suspect as it usually is with this genre of cuisine. Stop by if you are into this type of food."}
{"text":"For me personally I love this place. Always consistent. The service is good and its so close to my house! Seems like a family own business which makes the vibe even cooler. Everyone that works here is always very nice and accommodating! I've come here so much that they even know my routine! Makes me feel like I'm apart of the fam! Haha!!"}
{"text":"Pho MaiLan is one of my favorite pho restaurants in town and it just happens to be just down the street from my house. The food is reasonably priced and very tasty. The service is great to! While it is not as cheap as many of the pho places I am used to in SoCal, this place does not disappoint at all either."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a new Vietnamese Restaurant in Henderson.. I hate to drive to Spring Mountain..Looked up some review found Pho MaiLan & the review were really good..  Went there a couple of weeks ago it was really good We went back for Lunch today and was not surprised that they were busy..  The place is very clean and very open so you do not feel like some is sitting on your lap and listening to your conversation.. which is like what most Vietnamese Restaurants are like..  I had the same items again & the items were really good again..Egg Rolls really good.. I love the Beef Stew with Rice Noodle.. My son had Pho and said it was good..We had some items for take out ..the Grilled items on the menu really good also.. The service is really good.. friendly & fast.. price is just right..without the drive to Spring Mountain for Vietnamese food.. I have been eating Vietnamese food since the early 80's and this place is really good.."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Service is always great and every dish my family has ordered has been delicious.  Grilled pork rolls is my favorite app.  Love the vermicelli bowls.  Especially the grilled pork and onion.  My kids love the pork katsu plate and the best soup is the Bun Bo Hue, spicy noodle soup."}
{"text":"We kind of stumbled upon this place but we were glad we did. This is like the authentic pho you find in Chinatown, except you're in Henderson.. plus, the service is waaaaay better. Definitely a place to go if you're looking for some yummy Vietnamese dishes and for a good price! They've got certain lunch deals and they're definitely worth it. So is the bowl of pho. It's good sized and tastes super good! We also got the chicken wings and those were boooomb. We were so happy to have eaten here and will for sure come back!"}
{"text":"I've been to Pho MaiLan several times now. It's the closest pho joint to my house, which makes it the go-to by default. Mind you, I wouldn't keep going back if it sucked, and it definitely doesn't.  The pho is decent--good quality meat, broth isn't bad, and they give you a fair portion--and the service is excellent (as long as it's one of the adults doing the servicing... the couple kids who work there definitely don't have the same customer service ethic). Definitely the friendliest of all pho places I've ever been to (although Lemongrass is a close second in that department).  I've had several of the beef pho dishes as well as a couple of the vermicelli ones, one of the new banh mi specials (pork), and their new lemongrass grilled chicken plate. I'll break it down for you:  * The sandwich had more teriyaki-type sauce on it than most I've tried (not sure what that sauce a actually is, traditionally), but was really tasty. * I'm not the hugest fan of the pho ga (chicken soup) as I find it pretty bland compared to the beef pho bowls, but that's true at pretty much any pho place I go. Oh a whim, I tried the mi van special (like the pho ga but with egg noodles instead of rice), but the noodles were super gross and it didn't have any more flavor than the pho ga. I definitely wouldn't recommend that one. * Ok, the lemongrass chicken -- well, it was definitely chicken, but it didn't taste at all of lemongrass, and seemed like it was actually covered in some sort of watery yellow curry (like the yellow curry used in Hawaiian cuisine, but waterier and with less flavor). Seemed overly salty, too, and I didn't bother eating my leftovers later. Oh well.  Above varying food reviews aside, I'll still keep coming back for the friendly service & the decent beef pho. They're also always happy to give me extra scallions & onions, which makes my tastebuds happy!"}
{"text":"So I made a to-go order today and well, the quality of the food was not the same as when I would dine in. I am truly disappointed. Rather than being honest and consistent, someone decided it's ok to trick the customer just to save some money. I drove from the east side just to come here! I was a regular and now, will no longer be coming back. Thanks for my burnt spicy chicken wings."}
{"text":"WILL NEVER come back here considering there are a couple of other better Vietnamese restaurants around the area.   I ordered to go and got: Beef wrapped in betel leaf appetizer Vermicelli with grilled pork  So I went to go pick it up and asked for an extra anchovy sauce that should come with the beef wraps. I've had this from other places and it usually comes with anchovy sauce AND on their menu it states \"served with anchovy sauce\". The employee (super nice btw) had no idea what I was talking about and said she would go and ask. Another employee came and asked me to elaborate. He then went back in the kitchen then came out and told me they were preparing it. I stood there a couple mins and the first employee came back and said let me check on it for you. Then I heard a voice from the back saying, \"no there's no anchovy sauce. We don't have anchovy sauce. There's nothing. I don't know.\" So I figured okay they don't have it, whatever it's fine. But then the second employee walks out and hands me a container of some sauce. I ask if that's really anchovy sauce and he says yes. Really? You're going to lie to me? At that point I just grabbed my food and left.   Reason for 1 stars: 1. Don't lie to me. If you don't have it then just tell me that. Don't try to give me something else and try to pull a fast one on me. What if I was allergic to something in that sauce? Not cool 2. Vermicelli was decent. BEEF WRAPS WERE NOT EVEN COOKED ALL THE WAY THROUGH. They pretty much gave me raw meat. The only part that was cooked was the outside. Completely pink on the inside. That is definitely not how it should be served. I was so disgusted. That's a health hazard. If you can't make a dish right then TAKE IT OFF OF YOUR MENU!!! It's that simple.   I would give this place ZERO stars if I could. I'll pass on this place. Definitely not my go-to Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"Perfect service, polite staff, clean restaurant, excellent Pho with perfect broth! We just stopped here on our way back from Arizona because we were craving Pho...everyone is satisfied with their dish!"}
{"text":"Service and food was mediocre. Mom ordered bun bo hue, the busser, a Vietnamese lady told my mom they were out, not the waitress. Pho broth was bland. My che didn't even come out until the end of the meal and the waitress never once came to check up on us."}
{"text":"When I first walked in I liked how the restaurant was very clean spacious and modern. That's about all I liked :( My husband and I went here for dinner on a Friday night and they were definitely overwhelmed with the amount of people in there. I'd say the restaurant was a little over half full.   We ended up getting the wrong appetizer delivered to us, and the waiter spilled a bit of my husbands pho on his hands when he delivered it to our table. We both ordered pho and it was underwhelming. It wasn't very hot at all...just barely warm. It wasn't enough to cook the rare steak that was in my pho. The noodles were also overcooked and just mush.....blech. The broth was pretty weak and had a weird funky aftertaste to it too. Almost like a smokey flavor to it. I didn't care for it at all. No one came to check on us and we never got refills on our drinks.  We waited a while to get our check and finally my husband just got up and went to the counter to pay. While paying I saw someone else got pho spilled on them big time. I was confused since I saw so many 5 star reviews on yelp which was why I chose to try this place out. Maybe I caught them on a bad night? They definitely need to get their act together or hire more servers. Give this place a womp womp. Don't think I'll be heading back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've been their regular client for prolly 5 years now. The service is always on point, food is bomb!!!"}
{"text":"Finally decided to try this place so I could compare it to Pho Saigon 8 down the street.   Pho Mai Lan is a nicer / cleaner restaurant with better service. Their menu is extensive. They were really good about splitting the bill and didn't rush us (but were prompt when we asked for it).    I had the bun cha gio thit nuong (cold vermicelli with grilled sliced pork and crispy egg rolls), which was good, but the vermicelli was a smidge overcooked for my taste.   I also had the nem nuong cuon (roasted pork rolls / spring rolls), which were alright. The rice paper was fresh and not dry/thick, but the filling was mostly lettuce and not that interesting. The roasted pork was also not the same as the kind I'm used to finding in spring rolls, but it was tasty nonetheless.   Unfortunately, since I've never had the bun at Pho Saigon 8 and I have yet to try the pho at Pho Mai Lan, my goal of trying to compare them was not met. whoops! I'll definitely be coming back to give the pho a try."}
{"text":"Great food so far I have my new pho soup spot.  Pretty clean.  Service can be awesome.  Thai iced tea is pretty good.  Been here several times now.  They even have a happy hour.  Egg rolls have fish in them however still very good unfortunately my wife is unable to eat them because of the fish."}
{"text":"This is a good place to find Vietnamese food if you live around the area and don't want to drive down to Chinatown.  I always order the grilled short ribs since I can't make them that well.  That's my go to dish and they've always been delicious and perfectly charred.  I've also had the banh mi there.  It's okay, nothing outstanding.  The service as well is just okay.  This place all in all is just okay.  Like I said, it's a good alternative when you're in the area and don't want to make the drive to more options in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Affordable, fast &  yummy.. Customer service was excellent!  FYI they have happy hour from 3-5pm"}
{"text":"Walked in and was surprised this place didnt reek of pho like other vietnamese restaurants do. Its really clean, has modern decor, and excellllllent service! Even a good place to do large groups. We ordered:  - meatball pho - nice and clear broth. we're so used to the LA pho thats laden with fat on top and MSG. LOL. I actually didn't taste the meatballs but the bf said he really liked it a lot  - pho with crispy flank and marbled brisket (#7 i think?) - i looove the texture the flank! it was chewy and crunchy and so good. you will like it if you like cartilage-y stuff. the marbled brisket was delicious too. they also give you a good amount of meat in there  - spicy noodle (their special) - this comes with the bigger rice noodles. the broth may look scary and spicy but it actually wasnt spicy at all (for me). it had pieces of lemongrass, galanga and other spices in there. very very tasty! and also, lots of meat in it  - pork chop on rice - came with two big pieces of pork cooked perfectly  Overall, very good!! I love the selection, especially all the different types of meat you can get in your pho. Plus they have banh mi, rice dishes, and other things I wanna try. We will return!"}
