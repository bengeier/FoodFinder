{"text":"I was here while the owner was working. This random drunk girl clearly needed a ride home and I flagged the owner and asked him to help her get a safe ride home. He said \"I've been here 16 hours, and I don't care. Find someone else.\" He should be shut down."}
{"text":"Moved to the area and was looking up local places to eat. Saw the website, saw the menu, and saw that they did carry out. So we decided to call and ask about getting something for carry out. Asked the guy the answered the phone if we could order something for carry out over the phone and come pick it up and his response was, \"Uhh no. We don't do that. Got burned too many times. Yeah.\" 
Alright, understandable (although the website says they do). So I ask if we came to the bar and ordered our food there, if we could get it to go? His response, \"Uhh. Well. No. We're kind of busy and it'll be a hassle. So yeah, no.\" CLICK. 
I looked at my phone and my boyfriend who was listening in was like \"Did he just hang up on you??\"
HOW. RUDE. Excuse me for wanting to try your establishment. But don't fret, you won't be burdened by our business or by the people who come visit us. 
So disappointing that's how people think a business should be run."}
{"text":"Couldn't get service. Walked past the bar to sit down and waited almost ten minutes with no one greeting us. Ended up leaving for another restaurant. Bartenders were more interested in the basketball game."}
{"text":"The Bristled Boar!! Just the name in itself is a sign of class.  With its Barn like exterior, and its huge Boar's head are signs of a true Townie bar the town of Middleton can be proud of.  

As you walk in, the open area for the pool, Foosball, and darts is a nice area separated from the bar allowing proper game play and competition. Also the boar's Juke has a very nice display of music including some of my personal fav's Shinedown, System of a Down, and Hinder. The bar also has an interesting array of  patron's for the true elderly drunks that have been attending this place from their mid 30's to those of the younger ages just looking to throw a few to many back. It allows for many interesting interactions making an evening here very fun!!
 
Agreed with other reviews the beer selection is limited but they do have a descent array of hard liquors especially my personal favorite WHISKEY!! The prices from my one time stop seemed reasonable and the drinks actually had some liquor in them instead of just soda or water.
 
I have yet to try any food or enjoy their volleyball courts but would recommend that anyone interested in a townie atmosphere with the possibility of some excitement to give the place a try. I know I look forward to taking some of my friends to this place to get their opinions of what I like to call Middleton's Best Townie Bar!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so clean! Love the smoking area. The food is absolutely amazing!!! It is not JUST BAR food it is really great! The staff has always been very friendly as well."}
{"text":"I feel like I stepped into the up North in my own backyard, literally. We can hear the volleyball players from the apartment, and they sound like they are enjoying themselves. They Boar's head isn't just a name. It's hanging there, but the old hog adds some atmosphere. The previous reviewer is right, low on the beer selection. But I can walk there. Just another of life's trade offs."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped here for a few drinks for my birthday. Bartenders were very attentive and made all our drinks to order. Prices were pretty good.  Atmosphere was unique as if it was a log cabin, tv's were everywhere, and plenty of options for pool and darts. It was a fun place to hang out for the night. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Came here as a group bar crawl for my friend's birthday.

Though we were only here for under an hour, from what I remember I enjoyed the experience.

It's definitely a local dive, though the floors are cleaner than most. From the outside it gives you a feel of going to your cabin Up North. Christmas lights decorate the outside as well as inside of the establishment giving you warm fuzzies.

In true Midwestern fashion, they sell cherries soaked in Everclear by the glassful for $1. The cherries tasted like a numbing agent in your mouth, but the remaining juice wasn't as bad.

They have nightly specials, and tonight was Apple Pie Shots for $2.50. Not sure how much alcohol it had because we just kept doing these delights over and over again without any repercussion. 

They have a couple of pool tables, darts, slot games, and of course you can do the famed ski group shot here to go on your fb wall, you know, if you're into that kind of thing."}
{"text":"This place is actually pretty neat. I loved the Boars heads on the wall and the old western type feel to it. The drinks were really good, well made and strong but for some reason I really enjoyed the food. For being bar food it was actually pretty spectacular. Any drink ya like at a cheap price and some cool stuff to look at. Whats not to like? They got big TV's and fast service. (eBay style) A++++++++++++ Great Seller!!!!!! Will do business again!"}
{"text":"At its best the Bristled Boar is a great place to go with friends for an after-work drink or three, and maybe a game of pool or darts or just watch the game.  At its worst it is the epitome of a townie joint.  I've seen both over the last five years.  When I first visited the Boar it was a dive.  My college roommate had a job tending bar and we would from time to time take up his offer of free drinks in return for keeping him company.  The barstools were often filled with the usual regulars, drinking under a thick pall of smoke.  There is a certain charm to dive bars and I'm sure for some the old Boar had it, but not for me.  

Fortunately the owner completed renovated the entire bar, and this happened right about the time I moved out to MIddleton.  In place of the dingy walls was stylish wood paneling and tile floors instead of linoleum.  The ceilings were raised and the ventilation was improved, and while it can certainly still get smoky my eyes don't burn anymore.  There is a sand volleyball court out back and bar leagues during the summer.  The jukebox is relatively standard, but there are a few gems tucked in amidst the usual country & hard rock options.  The regular crowd is still around, but a good deal more young people can be found at the Boar these days.  Some nights are vibrant and fun, some not so much.  I can't say that I've tried much of the food.  I know from my old roommate that there is a small grill in back, which was added during the renovation.  The Emil's pizzas are good as always.  All in all the new Boar is a complete improvement over the old one.

There are still a few things that keep the Boar from being my favorite in Middleton, namely the tap selection.  I am a beer snob and proud of it, so when the only local tap option is Spotted Cow I call foul.  I can't think of another Middleton bar that doesn't have at least one Capital tap, or at least Esser's Best.  What really seals it for me is sometimes the Spotted lines aren't even clean and the beer comes out flat and a bit funky.  Another complaint that I frequently have is some of the bartenders know next to nothing about proper drink mixing.  It is usually the same bartenders that act put upon to even mix a drink as opposed to just grabbing a bottle.  Some of the older bartenders are very good, but you almost have to know the schedule to avoid the others."}
{"text":"Walked here from The Club Tavern (bout a 15 minute walk, better than getting pulled over for ridin' durty, trust me).  

This was 2nd bar into the night and everyone knows that a night out with Michael F. translates to plenty of Soco shots and an occasional dart toss (good luck beating the prick, he has his own dartboard in his house and only stops shooting darts to watch tapes of Dragonball Z).

Wooded interior like the retreat in \"The Great Outdoors\" starring John Candy.  Typical Middleton crowd, typical Middleton drink prices and quality, atypical taxidermy (even for a Wisconsin bar).  Its worth a visit."}
{"text":"I knew I had to check the place out as soon as I saw the name in the yelp app.  I was impressed by the large interior and overall layout. It was pretty tame when I was there, but after looking at a few of the pictures, I can tell that this place gets pretty wild. Awesome. I had a nice conversation with some locals and enjoyed a few local brews that were a perfect end to a long day. 

So next time you're in the neighborhood, come check this place out and give a nod to the stuffed boar head on the wall, it's seen a lot more action than pretty much everyone."}
{"text":"Best dive bar in Middleton. Lots of TVs if you want to watch sports. A nice deck for summer time. Food is nothing special, but its fine if you're hungry. There's always drink specials and the bartenders pore stiff drinks if that's your thing."}
{"text":"I am writing this review after going here for years. I have seen some questionable behavior on the part of the owner a few times, but never enough to make us stop frequenting it. Even had my 50th birthday party here. And while this bar has some of the best bartenders ever, last night there were 3 bartenders that I had never seen before. And they are bartenders that I plan on never seeing again. Don't ever run a tab at the bar because instead of an itemized list of what you had you will be presented with a receipt that only shows your total. And if you ask for any kind of accountability you will be flipped off and called names. Some people aren't meant to be in the service industry. The BB managed to find a whole slew of such people. Food is ok. Drinks are fine. But it is now scratched off our list."}
{"text":"Visited bar Sunday night lots of action, volleyball, pool, etc. cold beer great hamburgers and fries 3 dollar pints people friendly will be back."}
{"text":"First off,I feel I am friendly and easy to get along with, but this was the worst \"bartending experience\" I have ever encountered! [It was Thanksgiving Eve 6:15 in case the owner/manager might read this]. Either I was 1] not a regular or 2]a bother. NEVER again!"}
{"text":"Easily the best bar in the area.  A great mix of people in their 20s, 30s, 40s, and above.  The place is clean, friendly, and has a good local feel.  Also, the food is fantastic, especially the burgers."}
{"text":"So the Boar, as we affectionately call it. It's good for a lot of things. Darts, pool, Tuesday blues night (live blues band!), fun times, decent beer, waffle fries, and fried cheese curds (if you don't mind the sort that come from the freezer). The food? Not so great. It's not so bad, but it's just not that good.

I think everything is frozen at this place. Everything. We had pizza there the other night and I could taste the freezer burn. We still had a blast, but it would be nice if the food wasn't so obviously frozen. Everything is ordered from the bar, which is fine but a little weird.

There isn't too much to say about this place other than what I've just said. I'll go back because my friends at work like it, but it wouldn't be my top choice. There are definitely other places that can fill my dart needs while providing me with at least decent, non-frozen food.

Sorry, Boar - the truth can hurt."}
{"text":"I just went there for drinks with friends this past week (either Weds or Thurs, I can't remember which right now).  They had an excellent drink special--$2.50 Absolut mixers.  Woohoo!  

It's an odd place.  It's got an \"up north lodge\"-kind of vibe in one part of the bar; wood paneling  complete with a boar's head with glowing red eyes.  The other part, I *believe* had a different theme without wood paneling and a linoleum floor with a pool table.  There was a volleyball court outside.  The crowd was a strange mix.

Overall, I have nothing against the bar, and would go back if I was at my friend's house again."}
{"text":"Been to this bar a few times and have really enjoyed myself. I love the atmosphere...its very welcoming and the decor is entertaining. Drinks are strong. Love the big deck out back and free pool/darts  on Sunday nights. Will have to try the food soon."}
{"text":"Nicer than I expected. Great place for trivia. Very good fries."}
{"text":"Some friends and I ended up at the Bristled Boar mid-week because they offer one of the earlier trivia shows on the west side (crucial for our pal that has to get all the way back to Lake Mills at the end of the night after killing time after work from 4 o'clock on). 

The Boar is a pretty standard suburban bar - okay food, cheap drinks (my Shirley Temple came in a giant glass and was $1.75 on the low end, and my friend who ordered two Ketel cocktails got out for $9). One person in our group ordered a burger & fries and it looked okay - not a place I'd make a dinner destination, but also not a terrible option if you're already there.

On the trivia front, the venue was great - it was roomy, there was plenty of seating, and there are speakers placed throughout the building so you can actually hear the host's questions from wherever you sit. 

Everything was clean and we received table service despite the menu stating orders needed to come through the bar. I don't know if it'd be my scene once the lights go down, but we'll be back to play trivia again and spend our gift certificate winnings!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good bar food. I recently met a friend of mine there for a burger / it was good really good. There are few bars that I'm willing to order a burger at... and this Bristled Boar has gotten my attention. 

My friend ordered the Chicken Strips. I teased him until they arrived. They certainly were not the standard pre-breaded frozen thugs you find at most bars. They looked hand dipped and cooked to order. The waffle fries... wasn't expecting much - but Shazam - couldn't keep my fingers out of them."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience the first time I visited and it prompted me to leave a review on Facebook. Shortly thereafter, one of the bartenders kindly apologized for what turned out to be a misunderstanding and was gracious enough to offer free drinks to make things right. So I gladly accepted and had a stellar experience the second time around."}
{"text":"Animal heads on the wall always make me uncomfortable. Here, of course, they are boar's heads. Ew. At least they're small and unobtrusive. Other than that, I like the interior, it's all wood siding, floor to ceiling, in a natural walnut tone, not that ugly fake orangey finish that some places use. I like the setup, there's lots of big windows and natural light, easy to watch the volleyball games going on just out the back door. Tucked away in a mature tree filled lot, I really got the feeling that I was in the Dells and not just off a busy street in Middleton. The trivia announcer sits on a little triangular stage in the corner, which is probably where they have bands. Lots of tables spread out on the floor in front could be easily moved for dancing. The trivia was good, not too hard or too easy, and we came in 2nd place after a tie breaker (sports question, of course, oh nooooo...!) Even the tables here are made from the same rough-hewn planks, and one of my party was grossed out by the accumulation of crud in the spaces between the boards. He did have a point. The tap list is unremarkable, mostly mass produced standards with a couple of local seasonals. Luckily one of them was a Karben4, so I was happy. The food seems like standard Sysco issue. I just had the waffle fries, which were 1000% salt. I asked for the ketchup, and friend asked, \"do you mean this FANCY ketchup?\", which is what the label said. Turns out, fancy means tomatoes and high fructose corn syrup, upon further inspection. Who knew. Friend had a burger, which he described as tasteless. He tried dumping a lot of fancy ketchup on it, but finally gave up. They also have pizzas and other things, and another friend said the cheese curds are good. The table service was slow and perfunctory, but the one female bartender I interacted with was friendly and fast. We'll be back for the trivia and comfortable feel of the place, if not the food or service. Three stars seems right."}
{"text":"In Middleton, there are only a handful of bars that feel divey without being run-down and bland. This place hits the sweet spot between dive bar and comfortably hip. You'll find a mixed bag of patrons: plenty of guys in camo Under Armor sweatshirts, along with some fun young groups and middle aged couples in Badger gear. There are a lot of tvs and lots of seating, so it makes a great place to watch sports with a fun crowd.  They also have a pretty big patio by the volleyball courts. One of their biggest strengths: The bartenders are awesome, even during busy game days. 

They have a few macrobrews and a a decent selection of craft beers on tap and a good selection of bottles. There are a lot of daily drink specials and the food is decent. As another reviewer said, not a food destination spot, but if you are there and want some bar food, it's a fine option. Had the nachos during a recent Badger game and they were good, chips were maybe homemade? But they were pretty salty."}
{"text":"Definitely a place I could frequent...nice and open and live blues music every Tuesday night.   Be sure to check out \"Blues and Brews\""}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the Boar, and had been here many, many times over the last few years. Almost all of the servers are friendly and wonderful, and service is always prompt even when they're busy. The owner goes out of his way to celebrate with the entire bar on special occasions, such as football games, by making sure the full bar gets a touchdown shot, or including everyone in halftime goofiness. Halloween is especially fun here. I recommend The Boar for a fun place to go out and have a good time with friends."}
{"text":"Free tacos for packer games!  free touchdown shots!  great prices calm atmosphere"}
