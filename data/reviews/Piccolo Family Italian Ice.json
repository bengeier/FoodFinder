{"text":"Read all reviews. Wonder if one of the reviewers was really in the same shop! This is authentic Brooklyn style pizza and Italian ice..... Not shaved ice with sugary syrup. Dog odor???? I only smelled the delicious aroma of fresh mozzarella and homemade sauce! Shop was very clean and cheerful and we were welcomed with a smile and great conversation. Reasonably priced. I am Brooklyn, born and raised! Pizza and ice  brought me on a mini trip back home!"}
{"text":"Horrible.  I just left an empty store. There are no employees there. I sat in the store as I called it twice with no answer. I mean I drove 30 min to get here and no service. Totally PISSED. Doors unlocked, and empty. If this was NY they would of been robbed blind.   PISSED OFF GIRL FROM NJ!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Terrific Italian Ice with great selection of flavors.  They had amazing NY style pizza.  I could eat a whole Margherita pie by myself. Try a \"slice and ice\". YUMMY!!! Owners and staff could not be friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome Ices, great pizza and tasty sandwiches. Happy to support this small local business."}
{"text":"So fresh and good! I loved the pizza and Italian Ice, absolutely delicious! So glad to have this in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Love the italian ice, especially the lemon, lime and salted caramel. I'm a regular for life!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff behind the counter. Delicious chicken caprese sandwich.  Looking forward to trying the gelato on our next visit."}
{"text":"Awesome turkey BLT and Italian ice.  Friendly neighborhood family owned. :)"}
{"text":"The Italian ice here is excellent and everyone who works there is always very nice. I look forward to trying their sandwiches and pizza!"}
{"text":"This this honestly the best Italian ice I've had! No doubt 10/10 and the staff was friendly. No complaints."}
{"text":"Great place for some awesome Italian Ice & Ice tea. My kids love this place. They also have other item menu's."}
{"text":"We went for the first time to this place for a ice cream as advertised purchased on Groupon. The lady working behind the desk  was either the owner or the manager gave me a cold look when I told her I am referred by Groupon. I purchased 4x5 dollar coupons which she had to accept, it's per person. Instead, she charged me instead of using my other coupon for the other person and said, I don't make money otherwise, terrible, how ride. So I paid Groupon and then I paid her as well. What a scam. Most importantly the Gelato i ordered was not even good, to runny and to sweet. I wouldn't go or recommend it to anyone. Terrible choice.   And what's sad is three weeks after I went to that unpleasant place this person harasses me named Mary L writes me a bull story and lying and trying to make this place look good,  (the only customer sitting in that day). Really lady? I feel sorry for you. Did they give you a free sandwich to say good things to cancel my experience on that day? Come on, the real stories needs to be posted and that's what these apps are for. The good service and good food is what drives a business. You, being the only customer there and lying your teeth is not going to make that place look any better. That was our experience and last time we went there."}
{"text":"Great family-owned Italian Ice Shop. Robbin, the owner, is very helpful and willing to go the extra mile to make sure her customers are happy. You can also earn points to use toward free italian ice, popcorn, and pretzels! If you haven't been to this shop....GO RIGHT NOW!!"}
{"text":"BEST GOURMET SANDWICHES EVER!! Piccolo's is much much more than an Italian ice shop. I live close by and decided to walk in one day. A great decision. I ordered a sandwich and, it was the best sandwich I have ever had. Usually, you have to go to a gourmet deli in a market for sandwich like this. Not anymore. Robin, the owner, picks up the bread from the bakery fresh every single morning. All the meats are fresh and delicious!  Robin is happy to customize your sandwich anyway you'd like, salads too. The chicken caprese sandwich is warm and incredible.  I also love the Gavone.  They make a fabulous Stromboli too.  You absolutely can't go wrong here.  They have beer and soda and bottled water..  The best part... If the kids are getting the Italian ice, you can sit down and relax with a glass of champagne...., and I mean in a champagne glass (no paper cup) Piccolos is an absolute hidden gem. I am so glad I wandered in. The food here is absolutely addictive.  Give them a try, you will be so glad you did.Thank you Robin for these incredible gourmet treats!!!  Went back in and asked Robin to make me the gavone sandwich as a salad. Most fantastic salad....had to post a picture it's literally a work of art. Delicious."}
{"text":"Good texture but we found their Italian Ice to be bland, needing more sugar and fresh fruit churned in.   I wouldnt drive out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Love this little place.  Tucked away in a strip mall.  So you will have to look for it.   Amazing homemade sandwiches, fantastic NY style Italian Ice. Very kid friendly and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Excellent place. The attention is very good, the ice is sooo good. My kids love it. And the prices are great."}
{"text":"Italian ice! Who doesn't love refreshing, cool, sweet, yummy cold treats? I love dessert! So happy to find this cafe last week. My friend apparently stops in often for a peanut butter and jelly protein shake. We saw people coming in for sandwiches and lunch so we decided to try as it was lunch time. We ordered the Gavonne sandwich which is an Italian sandwich and Robin made it for us fresh!  I also had a mango smoothie which was delicious! Fun and vibrant comfortable vibe with great customer service and yummy food as well as treats!  It's in the shopping plaza so there is plenty of parking available. Great for lunch or snacks. I'm going to come by for desserts as well."}
{"text":"Best East coast dessert in AZ. Their pizza is amazing, they use fresh products and their sandwiches are to die for with fresh daily bread! Definitely stop in!"}
{"text":"Really good stuff. Soft Italian ice just like I remember from growing up on the East Coast; only thing missing are those white paper cups that you squeeze to get the last bit...  The Creamsicle had distinct orange and vanilla flavors, great together (mine), the cherry was bright and sweet (wife's), and the rainbow stole the show in the eyes of my six year old.   Worth every bit of the 30min drive from my house to have this cool treat on a hot AZ night.   Keep this place busy please we can't do it alone."}
{"text":"Great local business. Very friendly owners! I like their pizza and sitting out front on a nice day :) well worth checking out."}
{"text":"Ive went there for lunch one day and had one of their hot sandwiches.  It was delicious.  The ciabatta was fresh and the ingredients were perfect.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Try the custard with the Italian Ice, it is fantastic!  The owners are also the best, great local place."}
{"text":"So tasty!  We noticed this place opened right down the street from us, and I'm a big fan of frozen treats so we thought we would give it a go.  Very flavorful and refreshing! They have lots of flavors selections too.  We also ordered a flatbread pizza and oh my was that delicious with the fresh basil and mozzarella. It's a neat little place perfect for a summer cool down.  We will definitely be back!  P.S. If you pay with CC, they don't give you a chance to tip. So if you plan to, bring a little cash."}
{"text":"Piccolo family Italian is so much more than just a quick place to stop for amazing Italian ice. This is the perfect place for delicious fresh sandwiches and salads. Robin the owner is friendly and hard working and the love she has for being Italian shows in her food. Our daughter dances around the corner and this is the perfect place for last minute dinners or a casual hang out. Two thumbs up for this awesome restaurant"}
{"text":"I come to piccolo's a couple times a week and I love it. I get the Italian Turkey sandwich, panini style, with a side of marinara every time! This place has an easy going atmosphere and great friendly staff from Ny. Would recommend Piccolos to anyone!"}
{"text":"Came in here for the first time today and met Robin (owner) who was nice and inviting. She told me about the sandwiches they sell and after checking out the menu, I'll definitely be back for one in the near future. I also have to say the PB&J smoothie was delish! Definitely recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Bad experience. Online it looked like a passable date idea. Grab ice cream. Sandwiches available. Beautiful park with a view of the water nearby. While waiting for my date to arrive, I sat near the corner by the entrance to escape the Arizona heat and look at the online menu. (While doing so, I found the TV noise distasteful.) If I wasn't a clean looking white dude in nice tailor fit shirt and jeans, I would have sworn I was racially profiled or something. I was eyed like a suspicious character, even after letting the cashier know I was waiting for another person to arrive. (It wasn't just a cashier, from the website, it appears that she is the wife and mother of the family that runs the place.) I retreated to check out Goldie's Sports Cafe as an alternative, but was forced to come back to watch for my date to arrive. I walked out to meet my date (who was struggling to get off the phone with a coworker) when the cashier followed me up to my date to ask me if I was taking pictures earlier. I said I was honestly just looking at my smart phone. She hung around acting strange for a bit, but left after I asked her if I could help her. We both walked away and enjoyed Goldie's Sports Cafe a great deal instead."}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE Piccolo's Italian Ice!  Their Italian ice is super yummy and a great cold treat here in the desert!  The vanilla custard is my favorite and my sons love the chocolate ice and custard.  My daughter loves her cherry ice and will add second flavors too!  Their food is so amazing and like a little hidden gem tucked away in Scottsdale.  The Stromboli and pizza are both excellent.  I add peppers and get extra cheese to be high maintenance.   Service is always great and they are so friendly here.  Love supporting local family-owned businesses and they are such a great family!"}
{"text":"Saw this little gem out Pokemoning and thought I'd give it a try. I had the pretzel dog and it was very good! Bun toasted and everything. I'll be back to try the rest of their lunches!"}
{"text":"Cute Neighborhood Cafe' with excellent service, sandwiches, Pizza, pretzels, Italian Ices and Gelato. Absolutely loved the Chicken Caprese Sandwich! Plus affordable prices and everything is made to order. Robin the owner is a wonderful person and very friendly! Open Monday through Saturday 11 AM to 8 PM. Convenient location at Mercado in Scottsdale Ranch."}
{"text":"Surprised this establishment had so many positive reviews-  to be fair, we never even tried the shaved ice because not only were we not even greeted by the cashier upon entering the entire place reeked of wet dog and there are large doggie beds on the floor.  The lighting/decor needs a serious update and honestly a good clean scrubbing--"}
{"text":"Good food but I give the 5 stars for the customer service! Julie was extremely nice and helpful when I had my hands full with 2 toddlers and our dog trying to get food and ice cream lol. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Gotta love a local place in the neighborhood with great snacks and service!"}
{"text":"Being born and raised on the east coast my husband and I were excited to see this open next door to us! We love the pizza and of course the Italian ice is just like home! But the reason we keep coming back is the friendly, welcoming owners!"}
{"text":"A fantastic gem of a place. The service is awesome and the Italian ice is brought in directly from NY, and they serve beer and wine, what's not to like. Absolutely, cannot beat it! Try the lemon, it's super refreshing on a hot Scottsdale summer day."}
{"text":"Amazing chocolate Italian ice, best since I lived back east. Next time I will try the pizza or a sandwich, they look very good."}
{"text":"Bad customer service! The lady who helped me today wasn't friendly at all. I choose this place over Rita's and I was disappointed. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I'm new to the area! I love the welcoming vibe when I first came in!  The place was very clean, tidy, and organized.  The piña colada Italian ice I ordered was the best and smoothest flavor I've tasted in this world.  The grilled cheese was super delicious and different from any other I've ever had.  I can't wait to try more items on the menu! Robin was so kind, pleasant and offered to reheat my food, when I came back just to get a cup of ice. I'm very satisfied with the customer service and will be recommending everyone here!!!!"}
