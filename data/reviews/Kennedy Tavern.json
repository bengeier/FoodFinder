{"text":"I've eaten here a few times, and had overall good experiences every outing.

I usually eat at the bar, but have journeyed to the dining room floor without any faults, which is rare in a bar/tavern type setting.   Kennedy has some great ideas, and a quality staff to boot.

Try the Tuna appetizer, and the Truffled Flat Bread.

Fair and easy to read wine list.

A great place to eat"}
{"text":"We went here based upon some of the reviews and to get a bit away from GVR.  It was so-so.  Food defintely was standard fare (salads, flatbread (i.e. pizza), etc.  Nothing too interesting.  Service was just OK.  Overall, not great value for the price.  Granted it does have a bit of character inside the restaurant but you are better off going to Claim Jumper for more tasty food at better price.  One positive note: decent and varied wine list."}
{"text":"In planning a meeting at Green Valley Ranch, I needed a place for dinner for 20 people.  None of the attendees were locals, and are a mix of men and women, ages 30-60.  

After finding Kennedy Tavern on \"The District\" web site, and reading the reviews of local Yelpers, I decided to give them a try.  The dinner great -- it by far exceeded our \"dining experience\" at Olive's two years prior!  

Neil, the Manager, provided me with a pre-set menu, the chef gladly substituted a pork dish for a vegetarian dish, and Jeannie, the hostess was so pleasant every time I called with a question.  I was also able to preselect wine and appetizers, which were served within minutes after we were seated.

The location was a short walk from the hotel, and everyone liked the ambiance immediately (modern, industrial feel, and cleanliness).  Service was prompt and attentive, even though there was another large group that evening.

Each dish received rave reviews - especially the Onion soup and Pepper-Crusted Ahi.   Each course was served hot and to the desired \"doneness\" on each steak,  we never felt like we were being rushed or ignored (like on The Strip).

For a group business dinner, Kennedy Tavern is a great choice!"}
{"text":"Average food, good happy hour specials for drinks and appetizers, pretty dining room, friendly bartenders and servers. Open late."}
{"text":"Kennedy is so much fun! There are a few things that make this one to put in the little black book.
1. They are open twenty four hours
2. It isn't gross inside
3. They have Cheese fondue
Do I need to go on? 
I do have friends that adore their steak and are happy that it is available all night. However the fact that I can get a salad and melted cheese anytime gives this place four stars alone. Add in the pretty red rose decor and fun wrap around bar and your in for a great time.
Oh, and the wine selection is pretty good too!!"}
{"text":"Kennedy Tavern is one of the stops I must make every time I am at the District. Every time I go in I feel like I have been transplanted back to the sleek/retro bars I used to frequent on Sunset Blvd. It has a very relaxing laid-back vibe that I love. 

I usually sit and dine in the bar. Bartenders are great and can mix quite a cocktail. My fav. is the Midnight Martini which has my favorite vodka (Effen Black Cherry) mixed with pomegranate schnapps and bit of sweet and sour.....The nectar of the gods!!

The food is tasty too!! I recommend the following:

Tuna Chips: seared rare ahi with wonton chips and and orange mint 
                       sauce

Fondue App: Yummy Gruyere cheese with veggies, bread and apples

Hoisen Duck: Tender and flavorful... in a delectable mint sauce

Shrimp and Lobster Linguine: With a ton of veggies all tossed in an 
                                                      amazing lobster broth!! YUM!

On nice, warm day make sure to sit outside....great place to people watch and relax."}
{"text":"I have been here about 5 times.  I live just down the street from here.  Each time it has been tasty.  I did have a cheese plate that was sub par though.  Seemingly processed & uninspired.  Anyway, the service has been better than most LV spots & I have never had to leave a tip less than 20%.  I was told last night that they now close at 4am & stop serving food at 2am.  Adios, 24 hours!  They do offer 1/2 price bottles of wine on Tuesdays too.  Outdoor seating as well, but no misters..."}
{"text":"I live on the other side of town and rarely visit Green Valley.  I was at GVR for a conference and went to a cocktail mixer at Kennedy Tavern.

It was a Tuesday night and besides our party of 50 people, there wasn't very many people there.  It would have been dead.  I had a few drinks and enjoyed the atmosphere.  The servers were very friendly and attentive.  I didn't get a chance to try the food.

Will I come back?  If I'm back in Egypt, I'd consider it."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had at a restaurant.  The food was terrible and service worse.  Don't ever eat here.  EVER.

The male/female bartender were very nice as I walked out, so it may be okay to grab a drink.

But Don't ever eat here!"}
{"text":"Fantastic dishes that are just a little different than what you would expect.  

Very cool atmosphere.  

I have been to Kennedy a number of times now and the experience is consistently good. 

Love the fact that I can get great food, even really late.

Was mad when they changed desserts, but love the new carrot cake."}
{"text":"I went with a group on saturday to take advantage of their \"Super Saturday\" promotion. 50% off all food for our table if we dined between 7-9 and mentioned super saturday when making the reservation. Give it a try!!

Atmosphere: Sleek...modern... fun.. I really loved the feel of this place. The black \"leather\" booths were comfy.

Drinks: First round was awesome. Yummy martinis that were perfectly crafted. 2nd round came from a different bartender. They all sucked. Paying $10 a pop for inconsistent drinks is a bummer!

Food: calamari was excellent. Crisp and a great portion size. Foccacia on the table was warm and delish. My ahi tuna salad was gross unfortunately. The tuna wasn't fresh.. it wasn't seasoned.. it was just bland chewy mush on my plate. The salad came dressed (when I asked for dressing on the side). The plate wasn't put together particularly well.... just not a great salad (especially compared to the delish ahi crunch salad at Yardhouse!!). My fiance was happy (but not super excited) about his chicken fetticuine. 

Overall not a *bad* experience, but not great. I'd try them again, but I'm in no rush at this point."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chinese chicken salad. It was really good and unlike any chicken salad I've ever had. The chicken was like sesame seed encrusted and it came in a bowl made if wonton. The calamari was also good. Not the best I've ever had but really good. I sampled the filet. Also great. Impeccable service but we went on a night the place was fairly empty. 

I also highly recommend trying the key lime martini."}
{"text":"This is probably more of a 3.5 stars.  The food was good but there were some things about this restaurant that annoyed the crap out of me.

First, was the cheese fondue appetizer.  It's a lot of food, and so it should because it costs $18.  They do not give you enough apples, veggies, bread, etc to eat it all.  And when you run out, they charge you if you want more, except for bread.  I didn't want bread, I wanted more apples and cauliflower.  It really annoyed me that I had to pay more than $18 if I wanted it.

Also, we went here because we had a restaurant.com certificate, which is supposed to be a gift certificate, not a coupon.  They have some good food specials and only let you order one special with the certificate, not two.  It was very odd.

However, I ended up ordering the Chinese Chicken Salad and was pleasantly surprised.  It was literally one of the best \"entree\" type salads I have ever eaten.  My husband had the chicken alfredo and it was good too, but we were too full from the fondue to eat it all.

Another weird thing about this place is that they have a really big fish tank in the dining area, and when I went to the ladies room the other side of the fish tank is literally in the ladies room, so when I washed my hands I could see all the diners.  It made me a little uncomfortable knowing that people could see when I go to the bathroom through that fish tank.

This is worth it and would go back, but I have some reservations about how they run their restaurant."}
{"text":"The key with kennedy's is that you have to go during their happy hours to be able to partake in many of their awesome apps (1/2 off during happy hour) Granted..... I can only speak for the seared ahi tuna, but that enough is worth me making the trip down there in the middle of the night. 

And the best part about going during the week during the middle of the night besides the 1/2 price apps? The awesome bartenders who keep the drinks cold and the conversation warm.  (That did not sound to cheezy did it? ) LOL"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Kennedy's for dinner tonight-had never been there before and was looking forward to checking it out. The food was good-Had the Cheese fondue, sausage and pepper flatbread, and chocolate fondue for dessert. Too bad the service was terrible!!!! We saw our waiter twice the entire time we were there and luckily the bussboys/food servers were there otherwise we would have gotten no service (keep in mind the restaurant was slow-not even half occupied). Needless to say I don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"This place was just awesome!! From the time we entered our service was both prompt and super friendly. Our booth was spacious( I hate little spaces or tables). Our server, Kyle, was by far, one of the BEST servers we have had the priveledge of encountering in a long time! By all means, ask for him!

Our appetizer, the Satay skewers were largely portioned and delicious. The Chicken Alfredo was excellent! For dessert we treated ourselves to the Fondue and it didn't let us down. 

During our meal, the manager Neil came by to check on us personally. I can tell you this type of service is what you won't get in one of those \"chain-type\" restaurants. He welcomed us back anytime and I'm sure we'll take him up on that!

We never felt rushed to finish our meal, even though it had gotten considerably busier in the dining room from when we were first seated. We were allowed to linger and enjoy and that's just what we did. 

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Kennedy's to anyone. It turned out to be a really special evening for us, and I'll gladly return."}
