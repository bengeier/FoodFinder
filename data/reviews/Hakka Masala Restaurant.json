{"text":"i noticed this restaurant when it first opened but for some reason never really got the urge to go in until this Ramadan.   the food is great, the service is great and the pricing is great. there is nothing more that anyone can ask for. you get very large portions at fair prices  i have ordered the tanduri noodles (choi main), the manchrian chicken (dry) and the chicken pakora and they all tasted great.   i would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"This place was formerly known as just hakka masala.  New ownership now and the place is just plain awful.  Everything we ordered was garbage.  The butter chicken was swimming in oil and had bones.  Did not at all taste like butter chicken.  The other dishes were also poorly prepared and tasted awful.  I will never visit here again."}
{"text":"I know of this place because I was given a menu many years ago.  I did not have a chance to try this place in Scarborough until NOW!  I needed a Hakka Chinese food fix.    I came in with my cousin around 7:30 and it was surprisingly dead.  There was one other table being served.  It was quiet and there was no music.  There was one host/waiter who came by and gave us the menus.  The menu and food pictures reminded me of Hakka Magic in Mississauga (Mavis & Brittania).   We ended up ordering one of the specials for Wednesday, Chicken Chow Mein for $4.99!  And also, Chicken Pakora and Fish Masala, all medium spice.  The host/waiter gave us a pitcher of water with plastic glasses.  I could hear the food being made from the back and it did take about 10-15 minutes to make.  I really liked how it took time to come out cuz I know it's not already prepared and can mean freshness.  Crispy Chicken Pakora came out first topped with raw onions and a lime.  Then we received the Chicken Chow Mein and Fish Masala.  The pakoras were red, totally crispy and juicy when you bit into it.  A spritz of oil comes out, nice and hot.  Gross and amazing at the same time!  I know that it's mega-oily but they're yummy.  They mimic more of fried chicken, instead of the traditional pakoras.  Not as hot as Linh Garden's!  The chow mein was good.  It had that smoky wok tasting noodles with pieces of chicken in it.  I rather have the Veggie Hakka Chow Mein because the noodles would be thicker and have more veggies but for $4.99, it sealed the deal.  The Fish Masala was amazing.  The outside was spicy, crispy and when you bit into it, it was so soft and tasty.  A little bit gingery but nonetheless, delicious.  Excellent complement to the chow mein.  We also got a bowl of white rice.  By the time we were done, it crowded up and became busy.  I believe there was a line-up for take-out!  Most definitely would go back for more.  It is so close by to Lucky's but I liked this one much more.  I highly recommend passing by, even for take-out!"}
