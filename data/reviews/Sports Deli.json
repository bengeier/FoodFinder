{"text":"(From my tip posted 1/7/2014)  Had a pepperoni slice with extra bacon topping. About $7. Order at the counter and wait around till your number is called. Slow, even though I was the only customer at about 5pm. Pizza slice was great, not too greasy or too doughy."}
{"text":"The sandwiches have a ridiculous amount of meat in them. I got the roast beef and it was really bland."}
{"text":"Pure Chaos....50 people packed into the small ordering area.....Here is just another example of that ole Oxy - Moron : Casino Management! There was a convention on....like usual I suspect. Near Lunchtime, the buffet was closed...2 tiny restaurants to try feed everyone. Second, the people cooking seemed to be bouncing off each other more often than slamming down more burgers on the grill....45 mins wait....filthy tables, pop machine out of carbonation..... oy vey.... C'mon Rio Management.....anyone thinking there?"}
{"text":"Sort of a fast food walk up place where you order then pick up and you get your own table.  Well, you order pretty fast, but you don't get your order fast.  We spent like $35 for a meal for two just becuase it was new years eve and we needed a quick bite.  The $35 was for a combo and one sandwhich.  We sat down and was like maybe they ordered two onion rings and not one  Long time later we get our food.  Nope, one order of rings.  Food was pretty sad too.  I don't mind spending the money but come on.  There weren't that many onion rings plus the philly cheese steak wasn't that good.   I have to say the rings were the best thing there.  The only time you might think this place is good is if you are totally drunk and there is nothing else open in the area.  You can't bring kids there too cuase its part of the sports bar.  We saw some family get kicked out."}
{"text":"Awesome Matzo Ball Soup! Ordered the soup while betting on a football game just by chance and loved it so much, ordered it three more time during our stay at the MGM. Nice meal for only $5 bucks."}
{"text":"Nothing special, Decent food, sandwiches better than the pizza. Good for watching the game."}
{"text":"Very limited menu for deli connoisseurs. There are no knishes or latkes here. But, don't let the other reviews fool you, what's here is damn good (if you crave pastrami and matzo ball soup that is). Believe it or not the pastrami is some of the best I've had in town  (nice, spicy and moist) as is the matzo ball soup (great garlicky broth with thick chunks of chicken, celery and carrots). Plus, it's open 24 hours, so come here when you need to sober up!"}
{"text":"These guys were RUDE!  There was no one in line the guy couldn't even take the time to listen to my whole order!!!  I asked for whit bread he put it on rye. I ordered roast beef and he didn't even take the time to layer it properly everything was just slapped on.   The roast beef was bland and so was the matzo ball soup. I wish I would have just gone to subway!!!  It would have tasted so much better and at least their bread tastes fresh!!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to update my review. This used to be a place that I loved. But things have changed. The menu is different. They changed the burgers and fries. The first time I came after the update, my order took forever. This time, I flipped over my burger before I took a bite, and there were spots of mold on the bun. The food is still tasty, but not as good as it was before."}
{"text":"Decent choice if you're stuck in Rio without transportation.  Turkey sandwich on wheat a reasonably healthy choice.  It comes with a generous portion of meat, fresh lettuce and tomato.  That sandwich is $9, but you can get 14\" (double the size) for $14.  The small is plenty for 1, only get the 14\" if you're really hungry or sharing.  Why only 2 stars?  The clam chowder was a tasteless rip off.  Think consistency of chicken noodle soup and taste of...well nothing...no taste at all.   All that served lukewarm in the flimsiest  foam bowl.  As nice as the Rio hotel is, they can afford to and should treat their guests better so they can enjoy staying onsite."}
{"text":"Inside the Rio, next to the sports book.  I like to come here for their sandwich with brisket and pastrami. (Or do I get the brisket with corned beef? I think they have another with all three types of meat but it isn't as good)."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches!  I recommend the corned beef on rye or grilled ham and cheese.  Most guys like the cheese steaks.  The salads are decent here too.  I don't like the reheated pizza slices here but if you order a whole pizza fresh it's very good."}
{"text":"It ain't Katz's or the Carnegie. Sandwiches  are cheaper with less meat. I had the pastrami which was kinda dry but fair."}
{"text":"I'm with Stuart M, I don't get all of the over-priced comments. Its VEGAS, everything costs a little more. I was actually really happy with my experience at Stage Deli. Its located near all of the action in the casino and its fun to people watch while eating a quick lunch.   My boyfriend and I split the Reuben on rye with a side of potato salad. We also ordered two drinks and only spent $15. The Reuben was delicious, I couldn't have been any happier with the sandwich. The potato salad was also excellent and made a filling accompaniment. We left with full bellies, wallets intact. I would recommend Stage Deli for a quick and reasonably priced lunch."}
{"text":"Food is made fresh... its good, quick and easy!  Only drawback is that you are essentially eating on the casino floor  ...but got to watch a hockey game while I ate."}
{"text":"Good food here. The Italian sub is very good. Quesadillas are good as well. Cheapest besides Burger King in The Rio."}
{"text":"Yuck!  Had the pizza.  Barf!  If you are thinking about getting the pizza, save your money.  You can pour a can of prego on carboard and get the same effect."}
{"text":"Great late night spot to pickup food in the hotel. Huge portions! Not just a deli. Burgers and pizza. Garlic fries are not great.. Under-cooked and just garlic powder sprinkled on top, not cooked in minced garlic."}
{"text":"$11 for a mediocre cheeseburger, $12 for a small slightly better than frozen pizza with my Harrah's total rewards players card. You must be kidding me? No value conscious food choices in entire Rio Hotel. No wonder it is empty. Hope the place closes unless they decide to give their guests better more reasonably priced options to eat. I'll do my part and not spend here anymore until they shape up or shut their doors."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my italian sub a lot, I got the 7\"\" and chowed down half of it in seconds. The second half was just as good while I ate it in the poker room."}
{"text":"A deli right next to the sports book = Sports Deli.  Hmmm there really wasn't a choice for a quick meal and I didn't really trust the Vietnamese spot next door so decided to grab a sandwich.  Went for the pastrami + egg triple decker and damn it is a huuuge sandwich.  Essentially a pastrami sandwich and then on top of it are your veggies and a fried egg, then covered with another loaf of bread.    Tasted whatevers.  The pastrami is your generic deli pastrami, and pretty fatty too.  The egg is pan fried but I wished the yolk was only half cooked.  It's over $10 for the sandwich, so a bit pricey, but it is inside a casino, so that's to be expected.  Again, huge sandwich, so you won't feel hungry after that's for sure.    Add fries and a drink for $5 more.  Saw someone eat this crazy footlong hot dog.  That looked much better."}
{"text":"Hmmm... a wanna-be NY style deli in the casino.  Overpriced?  Yes.  The food?  Surprisingly, not bad at all.  Came here around midnight and I ordered the pastrami sandwich.  I didn't expect much but the sandwich is pretty big, on rye bread, and the pastrami itself was pretty good.  Lots of fatty pieces but I didn't really care at the time since I was so hungry.  It's about $10 for a sandwich with... nothing else but at least it was good.  Stopped by here the next morning for breakfast.  They have Krispy Kreme donuts there for $1.  Overpriced donuts, but I didn't feel like spending $5-8 bucks for a breakfast sandwich hahah.  Overall, sandwiches aren't bad.  Pretty good for a quick meal right on the casino floor."}
{"text":"The quality could be better.  I ordered a hot dog with cheddar and bacon, hot pastrami w/ Swiss, steak fries and a giant chocolate chip cookie.  It was ok..."}
{"text":"The Stage Deli is located in MGM near the sports book. It's a good place to grab a quick bite to eat. Their prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly. The sandwiches are large and taste good. The next time I'm in Las Vegas and on the south end of the strip, I plan on stopping by the Stage Deli to get myself a sandwich."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were very expensive. I totally expect to pay a premium price not only for Vegas pricing but also if it actually is going to be a New York deli style sandwich. I expect a pile of meat on fech bread with whatever condiments and veggies they have. The rye bread was fresh for the corned beef but that was the only plus. The meat was so extremely dry that I don't use mustard on my corned beef because it should be moist or slightly juicy but I had to use 2 of their weird little mustard packets because I was informed ' they don't put stuff on sandwiches\" The meat was also a bit greasy and had very little flavor but lots of fat that I had to cut off before I could eat. The pastrami was also very greasy but dry and extremely fatty. The cheescake was plastic wrapped on a paper plate cafeteria style and was not very good. It almost seemed like it wasn't baked. The crust was very light in color and hard and the filling was more sour than sweet like they forgot some of the vanilla and sugar.'  I definately would never come back here. I would rather eat at the Food court McDonalds"}
{"text":"One of the best pulled pork sandwiches I've had.  The lady from Hawaii is very friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing burger and fries but environment was a bit dirty - wet stuff on floor and trash push bin had a dirty cover."}
{"text":"I only picked up a Black & White Cookie to go.  $3.69 after tax and tip, which isn't bad when compared to the pastry prices at Bouchon or Jean Philippe.  I was rung up quickly and on my way.  They do not accept the mLife card.  The cookie itself isn't super sweet, so the chocolate and vanilla icing on top is where the real sugar comes from.  The cookie itself was enormous and had that soft, bread-like texture you expect from a black & white.  The icing only stuck to the plastic cling wrap when the cookie got warmer sitting in my car."}
{"text":"This is our fav place to eat in the Rio. The service is always friendly, pretty fast and the dining area is kept really clean. We have never had a bad meal here everything is good, o my goodness the parmesan fries are toooo die for. The cut of the fries and the way they're cooked are perfect. The prices may seem high but trust me when u get your food it is worth every cent, portions are shareable size, PLENTY OF FOOD."}
{"text":"If you just want a quick bite to eat then this is perfect spot. They are not open late so get there before 7:00pm"}
{"text":"Pizza, Burgers, beer.  Least expensive joint at Rio.  Ok food, service is pretty slow, seating limited."}
{"text":"Their employee really knew how to ruin good corned beef! It could have been good if they had only trained their employee to slice it against the grain, not with the grain, resulting in stringy, tough slabs. My jaw got tired of chewing. Unfortunately, I had it packed to go so I didn't notice it until I got back to my hotel. I really wanted to give it back and give them a lesson on how to cut the beef. If you want corned beef flavored beef jerky, by all means, go there. There's only one way it could have been worse...put it on white bread with mayo."}
{"text":"This little place rocks. It's tucked away next to the sports bar. I was Yelping looking for something we could walk to that was highly rated. I found the Sports Deli and realized I was standing 30 feet away! Their food isn't gourmet or anything fancy, just good home-cooking at very reasonable prices. Their special was very good with ample servings and good flavors. I was very pleasantly surprised. Just don't expect fancy!"}
{"text":"Try the Tahoe sandwich !  Inside the Rio sports book area. The place is pretty quick and obviously fresh. I love eating from there. Not the cheapest, but hey your in vegas betting so at least your gonna win when you eat a great sandwich!!..  My wife had the salds and it was huge so you could try that but I'm in vegas so beer and calories are on the menu.. :).. From what I can see, the area they make the food is clean and well organized. You eat pretty much in the sports book area, although they do have one table set aside in a side are for familes/parents with kids. Thought that was pretty nice.."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are just bread and a few slices of meat, not worth it for $9. Pretty subpar"}
{"text":"4.28.2016 came in for breakfast. Specials looked decent and were nicely priced, but staff was unfriendly and frankly rude. The cook at the time was also the cashier on a visit the day before and she was extra rude then also. I tried to brush it off as just a one-time manner. At that time, I was using a \"gold pass\" but needed to buy 2 meals. I acknowledged that I was paying cash for the other meal, yet she continued to lecture me on only buying 1 meal- also in a very hurried and demeaning tone. Today, she handed me my to-go box, didn't make eye contact or say a word. Even after I politely, and at a level I was sure she could hear, said \"thank you\"- still not a word.  The cashier today proceeded with the same lecture. I had bought an eggs and sausage \"breakfast\" which was literally just 2 eggs a slice of sausage and a 5 slices of toast! Still hungry, I went back to buy a sausage burrito and the cashier lectured \"you already bought a meal with that card. The program manager is really watching what is getting comp'd\" - to which I again said \"I'll pay cash that's fine\" yet she continued \"you see you already bought food earlier...\"- to which I had to stop her again with \"I'm paying cash\" and handed her money.  Honestly it's a $4-5 meal. If it's really that big of a deal, don't offer the comp to patrons. Between my family and I on this trip, we've gambled a couple thousand dollars just at this casino alone. If comp'ing a $30 meal is that strenuous, which it wasn't even comp'd, then we'll gladly take out \"business\" elsewhere."}
{"text":"I ordered a turkey sandwich on sourdough bread. The sandwich was extremely dry with not much taste and they put a big chunk of lettuce on the sandwich, no tomatoes. I would have been better off going to the McDonald's in the casino."}
{"text":"This deli used to be much better.  The only thing I ever order from here is the corned beef, which used to be less dry and a little tastier.  The last few times the quality has decreased.  The rye bread and swiss cheese that you put it on are good enough.  The cole slaw is an unusual color and processed.  This is a great place if you are staying at the MGM and need something FAST or LATE.  They are open 24hrs on weekends, and close very late on weekdays (I think 3-4am?).  They also sell fresh Krispy Kreme donuts, a plus for the morning if you're on your way out.  If you're a corned beef fanatic, you will enjoy this place enough.  Otherwise I can't strongly recommend it."}
{"text":"I ordered off of the video menu. It's shows a Pastrami sandwich that you could share with 2 other people if you wanted, that's how big the sandwich looks. Now see what I got and their saying its because it was flattened on the panini grill. NOT QUITE!! It comes naked, Cheese extra, no Russian dressing or slaw in the sandwich like traditional all deli style, that's extra too. I complained and was told that the picture is with added meat for an additional $3.00. That's not what the menu says. Take a look at this \"Deli Style Pastrami\" sandwich."}
{"text":"The sports deli had amazing food. I was very impressed. There was a slight wait for the food but it was well worth it. I just have to say that it was really busy and Brian (the one calling the orders out) was doing an excellent job keeping up with the fast pace and gave me excellent customer service. He was very nice and I personally saw him make other guests very happy as well. I really hope management sees the great work Brian and the team is doing. As a frequent Vegas guest, I will for sure be back to the Rio and the Sports Deli because of Brian and his excellent staff. Great job guys!!!"}
{"text":"I was trying to find a quick place for breakfast before I left to go to the airport.  This place sounded like a good idea - hot toasted bagel with ham, egg, and cheese.  The egg was a pre-formed piece of square that they pulled out, put a slice of ham and a slice of cheese on top... then stuck in the MICROWAVE.  Ugh.. at least they toasted my bagel separately."}
{"text":"I come here every time I need a quick bite to eat at the Rio.    I usually just order up a 18 inch pizza. For about ~20 bucks you could feed 4-5 people, which is probably the best deal.    They also have sandwiches, salads, and all those regular deli type stuff."}
{"text":"This place has decent food when you're drunk and been gambling. There was no other nearby places to eat and my friends were hungry. I took granites of chicken tenders. They were okay but nothing about them stood out. Basic dining"}
{"text":"Slowest service I have ever received - took 45 minutes to get chicken tenders with a minimal line. Customer service was poor and made these worse on a Saturday night they should have more staff. They were calling numbers out of order and completely forgot one order once we did get our food."}
{"text":"This is a place you go to at midnight out of desperation...and actually enjoy it a bit. The wait can be long, or maybe it was because I was starving and it seemed like a long wait. The menu is straightforward, the food is priced reasonably and it tastes okay."}
{"text":"Delicious turkey provolone sandwiches. Generous portions, affordable and good service. This is a gem in the MGM."}
{"text":"The worst Philly Cheese steak sandwich ever!!! Came for the Penn and Teller show here at the Rio, which should be great. But couldn't find any place to eat before the show so we ended up here for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Good place to hang out, talk , and chill. First time there was kind of eh. Two staff workers one taking orders and switching back to help cook and one full time cook. Food took almost 30 minutes. They were kind of busy so it was understanding. Second time was really better. Same situation but food was coming out faster. The wait time  was about 10 minutes."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review laying on the couch with food poisoning from the food I attempted to eat early Sunday morning. I will be contacting the health board as well as the food and beverage manager as soon as I feel up to it. But, here's my review minus the food poisoning. I had a $15 food comp that could only be used at casino owned establishments. So, I figured the deli should be solid since it's right next to the sports book (which is big and very nice and they want to keep bettors close by). WRONG! This is some of the inedible garbage I've ever been served! I ordered a philly cheese steak and chili cheese fries. Both were microwaved to death and straight up garbage. I ate just enough to get food poisoning before throwing the rest in the trash. Definitely the WORST casino food ever! The food and beverage manager is NOT doing his job by allowing slop like this s*it to be served. I won't mention the crap customer service and sanitary conditions because it's been addressed. Only eat here if you enjoy food poisoning."}
{"text":"Okay so it's about what you'd expect from a quickfire sports bar - tasty burgers (I'm not used to having to add my own condiments so it's a good thing I grabbed some packets on my way back up to the room), great cream puff things, and the corned beef sandwich smells AMAZING!  The only iffy thing about them was the cheese fries...to be honest I was not expecting, being Canadian and having a completely different concept of cheese fries, to receive fries that were a little damp like they'd come out of a steamer (probably from going straight into a takeout box) coated in the most tasteless nacho cheese in the world.  everything else they do is amazing, tasty, and i would eat there again in a heartbeat.  They even had rootbeer! I love rootbeer.... but I will never have the cheese fries again.  All in all I highly recommend this as the best cheap eats in the Rio."}
{"text":"Shruggin' my shoulders at this one. Typical sandwiches here but pricey ones. It's tough at the MGM to get something decent to eat with spending more than 20 greenbacks."}
{"text":"Bleh. Meh. Pff. Overpriced low-quality diner food. Think Denny's quality with a 300% markup."}
{"text":"Well during my stay at the Rio I pretty much lived off this place for two days. Am I proud of this? No I am not, but when you have to eat you have to go for what is open and close. So I ran through a few things on the menu and some were good and some were not that great.   My first run through of the place was I got the Lake Mead. This is a sandwich with corned beef and pastrami. It came piled high and was a $15.00 sandwich. It was OK, it had a couple problems. The meat just didn't feel like quality, in fact the meat was kind of slimy. I would not get this again. For my second attempt the late night munchies brought me to get the massive hot dog. It was good but its hard to mess up a hot dog. But it is huge, might be over a foot long. My final run was the Philly cheesesteak. This thing saved my life from a nasty hang over on a afternoon. It was a $20.00 sandwich but it was the best thing I had from this spot.   If you are staying here and are in a bind check this spot out. Just be careful of what you grab, I would stay away from the sandwich meat. Go with something off the grill and you should be ok. And I almost forgot, my wife in and I got the Pulled Pork Nachos at like 2AM. They were fantastic, perfect for that drunk munchie hour. If its late and you are buzzed get these freaking things. They are the hang over killer!!! CHEERS!!!"}
{"text":"Cheeseburger was good. I was expecting a single patty. I didn't read the menu correctly as it came with 2 patties. I took one off cause I wasn't that hungry. Fries were seasoned and fresh. Vanilla shake was good. It's fast food so I wasn't expecting it to be bomb. It was average. Nothing spectacular so it's a 3 for me. The pizza looks delicious when hot. After sitting there for a few hours, I decided not to order it. Heat lamps can only do so much and from what I saw, they weren't doing much. The slices are big but didn't look appetizing."}
{"text":"Pricey as everything is in the Rio but this is the best value in-house as at least the portions are huge and the food is good. Best place for stretching your dining credits for sure. Two people can also easily split many of the meals, so like the $12 breakfast is really $6 each if you're a couple.   Bowl of chili w/ cheese and onions ($6) - Was the best value in the casino by far, so of course it's off the menu now :(  Two egg breakfast w/ meat ($12) - Huge portions of potatoes, eggs (they say 2 but it looks like a lot more - maybe 2 mutant eggs), toast and choice of ham, bacon or sausage. The ham steak is the most EV+ by far, but bacon is alright as it's pretty good platter stuff and you get four slices ... I'd skip the sausage, you just get two meh-tasting links of meh size.   Chili cheese fries ($7.50) - Huge tray of these suckers, fries were good, chili barely there though. But definitely big enough for two people to split.   Pizza ($5-6 per slice, or 6.50 for any slice w/ a small but refillable soda) - Good filling size, it's the style where basically a 1/4 of a pizza is cut into two for a \"slice\". Supreme was packed with toppings. Nothing mindblowing but a solid slice."}
{"text":"One of the better places to eat at the Rio.  Huge selection of sandwiches, pizza, wraps and bar food.  Prices are decent, but the portions are huge!!!  You can sit and relax and watch a few games at the sports book or take it to go and eat in your room.  My friends and I eat here more than any other place when we stay at the Rio.  It's inexpensive and food is above average and huge portions.  Check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Shouldn't even give a 1. Boyfriend passed out drunk and they have the audacity to charge 1 dollar for TAP water. No class. No care for the clientele that surrounds it with the popular night club."}
{"text":"I love pastrami!  if could get the real \"homemade stuff\" I'd eat it at least once a week! It's so hard to find fresh homemade pastrami outside of NYC.  Stage Deli is located in the MGM next to the sports book.  The sandwiches run about $9 they are pretty small compared to Carnegie but they are also half the price, so pretty much the same thing in my book.. I really liked the pastrami from here, very soft and tender and very flavorful, i liked it better than Carnegie (in the Mirage) it was more moist.  I also got the Daily double, half pastrami half corned beef, i think it was about a $1 more, also very good.  Best pastrami ive had in a very long time!  Next time ill just order a pastrami with double meat to make it as big as Carnegie."}
{"text":"The MGM poker room and Stage Deli's sandwiches go together like peanut butter and jelly.  But PB&J sandwiches aren't offered at Stage Deli.  Thoroughly confused?  Here's the explanation:  When playing poker at MGM (and clocked in with your MLife players card), you'll earn $1 an hour at the $1/$2 table, or $2 an hour at the $2/$5 table.  That might not sound like much, but it actually adds up pretty quickly and unlike regular MLife comp dollars, these NEVER expire.  After wracking up those dollars, see the floor man for your running total, and to redeem a voucher for discounted or FREE food at Stage Deli.  He'll even have a Stage Deli menu available with all the item pricing (including tax) so that you can have that voucher printed out for the exact desired amount.  Sometimes during a long poker session, you might not feel like taking a long break for a fancy lunch or dinner.  A quick, simple sandwich might hit the spot, and that's exactly what Stage Deli offers, in addition to soups, salads, breakfast, drinks and desserts.  The service is extremely fast, moderately friendly, and the sandwiches are reasonably priced ($8.95 to $10.25).  All meats are delivered from the East Coast.  The taste is...  Acceptable.  Do expect to dress your sandwich up a bit with the provided condiments, and donn't expect to be blown away by quality or uniqueness.  Speed and simplicity should be what is appreciated at Stage Deli."}
{"text":"Good food. Reasonable priced. Rubin was good but the onion rings were full of grease.  Pastromi was great fries were good.  Ppen 24 hours steak and eggs for $6.99 after 11 pm"}
{"text":"Absolute disorganization on Saturday night here.  We were going to a show and needed to find a quick bite to eat. There was a line but it was small, and seeing the amount of people standing around waiting for their food should have been a good indication of the problems but it was our only option for something quick at this point. We figured we'd order something quick, so we had 3 slices of pizza and split mozzarella sticks. Quick right? Heat the slices in the oven, drop the mozzie sticks in the fryer, should be done in 10 min? Nope. 40 min wait. Once we had ordered, we sat at the table having a beer while waiting. I saw a couple people walk up to order their food, and watched them walk out with pizza, burgers, etc and our number had still not been called!  This happened 3 times.  My bf went up to inquire about it, and he said they grabbed a huge trail of paper from the machine and began fulfilling the orders of those standing around waiting forever for food. It's not a place where you're letting sauces reduce down! It's sandwiches, salads, pizza, hot dogs, hamburgers, fries...c'mon!  Get it together!  We literally had 10 minutes to scarf down our food and get to the show which ultimately ended in us both getting heartburn during the show. It was miserable and I will never visit this establishment again. We should have eaten at the noodle place beside it. People seemed to be getting their food in 5 min or less. In fact, I saw two couples get food from the noodle place after we had placed our order. They were both done and out of there around the same time we received our food."}
{"text":"Located inside the Rio. This probably has the best value in terms of affordability when it comes to buying food at the Rio because usually the food is overpriced.   You get what you pay for, but they give you pretty big potions. The food however, is mediocre. But if you are looking for a quick bite at the Rio, or a place for late night munchies... this may be the place for you. They are closed only from 6am to 8am!"}
{"text":"Open late night, great for people just getting into town and want to remain in their casual dress.  Open seating type place, just order at the deli counter and they will call you up when it is ready. Very friendly service, FAST service. We had our food in mere minutes. Fresh! He got the staff recommendation of a reuben sandwich and I got the corn chowder soup. The soup was served steaming hot and I find this just never happens anymore these days. I asked staff at the counter for something spicy for my soup and they were happy to hand over a little container of jalapenos. Extra crackers? No problem! 4 stars for what it is. I would recommend it though and have already to friends staying at MGM."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have ever had!!!! I'm not sure if it was because I was hungry but the pizza here was simply amazing!! They're open all night so it was nice when we were hungry at 4 in the morning. The workers were kind and helpful and we didn't get any rude looks when we were browsing their huge menu. They were patient with us even though it was 4am and we were a little drunk. A must have if you're ever in rio in the wee hours of the night and starving!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst lunch I've had in Vegas. I'm not sure where they get their ham but it was as cheap in quality as I'd imagine possible. The photos they advertise of the shrimp basket special are nothing close to reality. The shrimp were so tiny all I could taste was the over cooked breading. The only thing they have going for them is their proximity to the sports book."}
{"text":"Great food. We eat here whenever we are at the Rio. Sometimes a little slow but always worth the wait. Fresh tasting burgers, pepperoni pizza is bomb. Maybe a bit over priced but it is open 24 hours and always feel satisfied."}
{"text":"First time at this casino...was near by and wanted to try a new place to eat. I came late night/early morning but only one restaurant was open & it was here. Half of the items weren't available anymore but were still pictured on the menu. The lady at the counter who took my order was basically asleep and the rest of the staff just looked bored.   I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with fries after my original order was no longer on their menu & it took about 20 mins. That's kind of long for a basic meal at a deli. The burger itself was very good (that's why 2 stars). The fries were bland w/ no seasoning and some of the tables were not clean. While I was eating one of the casino security guards started talking to me & trying to flirt with me while my mouth was full and I obviously just wanted to enjoy my meal. Not a good experience for me!"}
{"text":"Great for quick sandwiches on the go or before a game. Smoke in hotel really kills it for me."}
{"text":"good place to grab a cheap breakfast sandwhich and coffee if you do not want to spend a fortune on breakfast. Kind of an algternative to starbucks but with breakfast sandwiches. Husband had matzaball soup and said it was good."}
{"text":"We went to Stage Deli at the MGM late one night after watching a show.  The sandwiches and chili dog were okay.    The Pastrami Reuben was okay.  It had a lot of meat and was kind of tasty.  But after traveling to New York and eating sandwiches there, it wasn't really a comparison.    The chili was okay but nothing special.  The hot dog was a little skinny and didn't have a snap.    Overall it did the job of a late night snack."}
{"text":"Located inside the Rio and next to the sports book is this hidden gem.  It's opened 24 hours and I was amazed to see the quality and quantity of the foods for a walk up counter.  I just needed a quick small lunch, but instead I got a big one.  It did take some time, but they cook to order, so you will have to wait a little while.  They have a numbered system that allows you to know when your order is up.  Basic fast food type chairs and tables are there with a good sight line to watch sport books TVs.  I would come back."}
{"text":"Ate the summer barley soup. $5 for a good sized bowl of warm goodness smack dab in the middle of the casino? Let's not get too judgemental, people. That's a good deal for a meal literally steps outside of Hakkasan to end your drunken night of shuffling and/or fist pumping.  There were plenty of veggies, chicken, and barley (duh, it's called barley soup)... And I liked it! Can't speak for the rest of the menu, but I'm a soup gal. I probably wouldn't order anything else anyway.  Haters gon hate."}
{"text":"Guess I should have ordered my sandwich with sourdough instead of the cheap stale rye bread."}
{"text":"It's a starbucks type spot, but selling sandwiches. Bad ones too. I rather eat Subway across the street. The sandwiches are overpriced for what they are. Reminded me of those cold pre-packaged airplane sandwiches. Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed. I wanted to ask for my $ back."}
{"text":"Gross pulled pork nachos do not get them at all. So gross. The onion rings are decent."}
{"text":"I'm shocked this place doesn't have better reviews!   First off, their hours are great. They're only closed from 6 AM to 8 AM so your drunken munchies will be fed, fear not!  Secondly, their menu is surprisingly big making it a tough choice to order. The bacon that comes in the sandwiches is thick, the fries are made to order (so you can order well-done fries), and you can watch them cook your food fresh right in front of you.  Thirdly, The staff there was also not opposed to me making special requests (sourdough bread instead of a burger bun, well-done fries, and extra ranch.) There is also a ketchup, mayo, and mustard station that is accessible so you don't have to wait in line to ask a staff member for some.   Lastly, the prices aren't terrible! Sure, $15 for a sandwich and fries sound bad, but compared to standard Vegas prices? Not bad at all. And the portions were big!"}
{"text":"Convenient and upscale Sports Deli near the Sports Book and Poker Room serves burgers, bratwursts, wood-fired pizzas and homemade sandwiches. Had a wide choice of great tasting Salads."}
{"text":"The Stage Deli in New York closed a few years ago, so it was a pleasant surprise to see the name in the MGM Grand.  Among many high priced restaurants, the Stage Deli seems like a reasonable choice. In any other locale it might be considered overpriced. Neither of us was particularly hungry, and we were planning on meeting up with relatives so we wanted something quick.   There are tables, but there is no table service. The menu includes the typical sandwiches - corned beef, pastrami, etc. They have other typical deli fare including soup. Kerrie and I shared a Matzo Ball Soup and fresh fruit. On the menu, which we didn't get, were various Dr Brown's sodas.  The soup was outstanding. The fruit was okay. I really wish they offered table service."}
{"text":"Not bad but overpriced as with anything else in the casinos. What you'd expect from a regular burger joint. Pretty good bread."}
{"text":"This place is great. The service is excellent and fast for the amount of customer they get during peak hours. Especially during WSOP month.  I had the chicken wings. Delicious! A dozen for $14. The wings was nicely breaded. I ordered the plained wings. Came with ranch and hot sauce on the side.   I tried their slice of pizza also. The supreme. $5.50. Was good.   Overall this a quick place to grab food after a long session in poker."}
{"text":"My vacation buddy wanted a sandwich cause she said this huge sandwich on the video monitor as we were wondering around looking for the CSI Experience. The sandwiches were rather average but tasty. The pickles were nasty and tasted like fish which was odd since  they didn't have any fish on the menu.   The deli was a little place nestled in the corner next to the place where people can sit and place beats on races and games etc. The price of the sandwiches ranged from 9 to 12.00 per sandwich which no chips or drink."}
{"text":"i love this place! people are always asking wheres a fast/good/cheap place to eat in vegas when theyre in a rush to get ready before clubbing or whatever.   besides earl of sandwich.. this sports deli located in the rio hotel is awesome! get one of the triple deckers. theyre about $13 with no fries or drink. kinda expensive but its soo good."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my Stage Deli sandwich. It was a bit pricey for a sandwich ($8 bucks) but what isn't in Vegas. My brisket was soft and juicy and the best part, no line.  Nice alternative to the MGM food court when you need something pronto!"}
{"text":"A cheapish option inside MGM, that serves basic interpretations of new york deli favorites.  Pastrami was pretty basic, and the accompanying pickles (at least you get two spears) were pretty sad.  The Reuben had the thousand Island on the side, which I hadn't seen before, but is a trend I hope more places embrace. All in all there are a bunch of good places to eat in mgm, but not too many places for people on the budget.  They don't serve food here, they serve fuel to keep you going."}
{"text":"Came here to grab a bite to eat before checking in to my hotel. They had pretty popular sandwiches. Heard it was a good place for a quick bite to eat. I ordered a brisket sandwich and it came out as soon as I paid. The sandwich was nice and warm. The bread was soft and fluffy. The meat was kinda dry though. It might be because it's brisket. There wasn't anything in there other than brisket and the bread. Brisket was tender but it just lacked any moisture. Flavor wise, it was not bad. Tasted pretty smokey and meaty. The guy next to me got a pastrami sandwich and it looked better than mine. I should have got the pastrami. It was the same price. The prices are pretty expensive but that's what you expect from a resort on the strip."}
{"text":"I don't know how the day time is, but late night they only serve a few items. The cooks are dirty and don't wash their hand or change their gloves after starting or wiping their heads or running their hands through their hair"}
{"text":"Frustrating to pay more for low quality.  I'm on vacation in a casino.  I expect to pay more, but at least for something good.  The sandwich I ordered was $10 but used grocery bread and iceberg lettuce.  There was no empty tables and the lady at the counter said, \"You can sit at Starbucks...\"  I walked over to Starbucks with a tray and a number of people bumped into me and almost knocked over my food.  Did I mention that the sandwich was not that great???  This place was near the west entrance near the convenience store with a Subway.  Subway would have been almost 50% of the cost and much better quality."}
{"text":"I was staying at Rio last week and had a very late dinner around 10:30pm-ish. We ordered one chicken strips, one buffalo chicken finger, and an onion rings. Was served very slow... very very slow and they lapse my order while chit chatting, and I was just standing right in front of them, watching them prepare my food. Very bad experience. Received our food around 11:00pm and all the chicken strip was very dry and hard. Very over cooked. Same for buffalo chicken finger too and its buffalo sauce was too sour/spicy to be tasty. Onion rings was okay but I would rather go to the AAB&G just right across the sports deli as it may cost less than $5 for the same thing but much better. Anyone who wants to visit this place - remember DO NOT ORDER FRIED CHICKEN STRIPS. Their sandwich or pizza might be better but I don't think I am going to give them another try recently."}
{"text":"Decent actually for a sports deli and one of the best options at Rio casino for the price range. Much better burgers than the American restaurant, chicken"}
{"text":"The sports deli at the Rio is our go to place for a quick snack or late night munchies. The food is served fairly quickly and everyone is friendly. The sandwiches are HUGE. I had the nachos this time, they were just ok, but a decent portion. The pizza is average. I really like the wings, you can order the sauce on the side and just have them crispy. The only negative is the price, it is quite expensive - oh well."}
{"text":"Everything we've had here is great!  And when I say great, I don't just mean 24 hour deli in a casino great, I mean regular great!  During the last trip, we decided to go there because (we always stay at Sam's Town) and my husband was starving.  He got the steak and eggs special for $5.99.  It was an amazing piece of steak with nice potatoes and toast....I mean, good looking food, not just grill food.  I had a grilled cheese sandwich and the fruit plate and it was the most awesome and succulent fruit I've had in a long time!  This month we went back (three months later) to celebrate our anniversary, and once again got hungry late at night.  I ordered the turkey sandwich and it was a very generous portion of turkey and a great sandwich, with a pickle spear and chips.  Too much for me to eat!  My husband had the steak and eggs again.  The staff is very attentive, the cook came out at one point when he had no orders to make and checked to see if we were all okay.  The only downside is that they don't refill your beverage for free, but hey, I can live!  This is a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Good burgers! My patty melt with fries was excellent. They use good quality rye bread! Fries were fresh, perfectly salted and piping hot. Husband got a cheeseburger (huge!) with potato salad he said was very good. Employees can ruin it though as they are miserable and rude."}
{"text":"Came for a casual dinner and was happy with the service. Our waters and drinks were brought out very fast and the food was the same. I was a little upset that I paid almost $20 for a veggie burger that probably wasn't worth and definitely didn't taste like $20. It was good but definitely not my favorite burger. If you want a good time inside your hotel and don't care much about price then this is a good place but if you're looking for something a little better quality then keep looking."}
{"text":"3 stars? you gotta be kidding me. Went to the buffet on a new years day, cashier said that'll be $50.00 please.  And I said that'll be not happening. Just around the corner, the gem of hidden jewels, stuffed my face with an AWESOME, I mean arguably the best freshly sliced reuben ever, for 11 bucks. Plenty of seating, no lines, and caught glimpses of the NFL games. I was pleasantly shocked by how good it was. Portion ok not humongous. The pickle was also awesome, rivaled langers deli back in los angeles, yes it was that good. Great unknown untapped source of deli sandwiches without the headache of long lines and insane prices. Quiet too."}
{"text":"I ate here 2-3 times. It's convienently next to the Poker Room and the service chicks bring you the food. The sandwiches are HUGE and great too. Easily better than any bullshit deli's I've eaten at in Denver.  The Pastrami sandwich is a MONSTER!"}
{"text":"Get the club sandwich that starts with a \"B\". It's great!!  Cheese fries are great too!"}
{"text":"Right next to the sports book, so we were able to catch some of the basketball games while we were there.  There is some tables where you can sit, and still catch the action in the sports book.  We snagged a table in the sports book that said reserved, but it wasn't busy so we didn't get hassled.  We ordered cheeseburgers, chicken wraps, fries, onion rings and a salad.  I would order everything again except the salad.    Prices were a little on the higher side, but it was actually tasty bar food.  Hit the stomach after a night of downing beer after comped beer."}
{"text":"This review is mainly for the coffee here. This was the best priced place I could find inside of MGM to get coffee. They have a Starbucks as well, but the prices were over the top even for Starbucks and usually a long line. I lose enough money in the casino so I am not about to pay $7-$8 for a cup of coffee. There was usually no line here and service was fast and efficient. I did try one of their pastrami sandwiches late one night and it was pretty good. A little dry, but the pastrami had good flavor and the portion was generous. I would definitely visit this place again if in need of a quick snack or coffee. It is about the best deal you will find inside the MGM."}
{"text":"I'm sitting at the deli writing this review at 3:30 am and the place doesn't close for another 2 1/2 hours! Then, it opens for breakfast at 8 am. I've been here a few times and the food has been good and the people have been nice (especially dealing with obnoxious drunk people at 3 am). This time I had the Lake Mead sandwich and fries and it was tasty. The sandwich was fresh and the fries were hot. It's right next to the Sports Book, so you might miss is if you weren't paying attention. Come by for a late night snack."}
{"text":"Sandwich was ruined by my getting it \"grilled\" sandwich was soggy with butter...most disgusting thing ever. Insanely greasy. A napkin didn't even help!!"}
{"text":"The meat is decent but it's way over priced for the sandwich you get. I mean, I know it's supposed to be \"fast\" but this just sucks. I wished I walked out to the strip and just went to mcdonalds."}
{"text":"Very good hot pastrami sandwich on sourdough. Great spot to watch a game. The sports book is right next door. Good friendly service."}
{"text":"So this place is pricey for being fast food kind of. The food is decent though.  The cheese sticks are good but not for $6. I tried the chili and that wasn't all that great. It was $5 and it was not so good. The one thing that was really good was the ceasar salad. It was about $6 or so which is not bad at all. If I would have to go back I would definitely go back for the salad and nothing more."}
{"text":"Man, the portion sizes at this deli shop is ridiculous.  We wanted something light to eat after seeing a late show so I suggested getting a sandwich and a beer.  My buddy got the hot dog and I ordered a turkey club.  The bill was $30 bucks, so I was like, what the hell?  Then the food came out and I saw why...the hot dog was huge!  The sandwich was like a 2 footer stacked mile high.  I was like, are you guys kidding me?!?   I could only eat a quarter of the sandwich even though it was better than I expected because it was just too late."}
{"text":"The food was good, the service was quick, the place was pretty empty, and the staff were nice! When I'm back at the Rio again, I'll definitely catch another bit to eat here."}
{"text":"I would give it 5 stars if they had their previous menu with all the triple decker sandwich options, because my husband and I frequent RIO a lot..and always order from the Sports Deli..but they have changed a bit..I think they should go back to the old menu..and also go back to their old hours:)) Will still go back..just not as happy"}
{"text":"Nice place to eat. Wasn't amazing or anything, but I liked their pizza. Got a 12 inch pie for just 10 bucks and the bread dough they use for the pizza was quite tasty. Good stuff, wouldn't mind eating there again :)"}
{"text":"Pizza was undercooked, the crust was white, it needs to be golden brown.  Chili was awful,  they don't even bother putting onions in it. Yuck."}
{"text":"inedible! their spaghetti and meatballs look and taste like dog food, although i wouldn't feed it to my dogs. their spaghetti used to be so good."}
{"text":"The worst service I've experienced inside a hotel/casino. We were recently working the Latin Grammy Awards at Hakkasan, and this place was close by, so we tried it. I did not expect a hispanic speaking person to take my order, and then an asian person who barely spoke english to ring me up and take my money for 3 sandwiches that totaled $60.00. The food was plain, the service was terrible, and I will never ever go back to this deli."}
{"text":"The food the Sports Deli does best on are the finger foods and sandwiches.  The buffalo wings we just ordered were spot on.  As good as any wings I've had.  My preference is to get the wings dry with the sauce on the side, that way the wings will stay crispy longer.  We also got the #8 Silver State (beef, pastrami, brisket, swiss) which was pretty good.  It kind of reminded me of NYC deli's...yeah, that good!  Next time though I'm going to grab a bite of the #7 Boulder City (pastrami, fried egg, bacon, cheddar)...a recipe to clog my arteries even more.  You're going down #7!...inside my stomach, that is, next time I'm near the Sports Deli.  The pizzas and burgers are just OK.  Not worth an attempt in my opinion, but then it again it's not my appetite or stomach.  To each his own!  But I'll stick to the sandwiches and finger foods."}
{"text":"Just had the mush/Swiss burger ugh! What a disappointment not enough mushrooms and the meat was well done when I asked for med rare. The bun that was suppose to be toasted was burnt, the only thing this place has going for it is the pizza and the onion rings."}
{"text":"A breath of fresh air after five days of eating big, heavy, expensive meals.  I got the Reuben and a side of potato salad it was pretty damn good.  My boyfriend got the pastrami and was pleased to see them freshly slice a huge slab of steaming meat.  Not a bad deal for $20.  We dipped into the Grand Canyon souvenir/junk shop to get some chips for our meal.  Sides and drinks were a tad overpriced.  Not the biggest selection of sandwiches so if you're a picky eater, you may not be too excited about this place.   Four stars for reasonably-priced and not being deep fried and greasy!"}
{"text":"perfect mid-night snack the pastrami was great price was fair for a Vegas casino, I like that i ddint have to stand around waiting 20min for a sandwich the had it ready in less then 5min and thats with 15people in line ordering before me.."}
{"text":"Putting this deli right next to Hakkassan is GENIUS. It's so convenient for those on the prowl for m BASICALLY any food after a night of clubbing!  Got the brisket sandwich and the portions are pretty legit. You get two slices of bread and a HUGE LUMP of meat!   It's about $10 but at that point in the night, it's worth. (Anytime else I would call it insane) Plus, only their patrons are allowed to sit at their dining area so I mean, how badly do your feet hurt?"}
{"text":"This place is open til about 11pm on weekdays so it's open pretty late if you get hungry and want to get something munch on.  The sandwiches here are pretty big if you get the ones with three layers of bread.  It's good enough to keep you full for the night while you sleep in and wake up to a real breakfast or lunch.    The wings were tangy and hot which were pretty good.  Fries is normal and the sandwiches were pretty filling with a lot of meat.   For dessert the Neapolitan was tasty but really heavy for one person."}
{"text":"$40 for two salads and a sandwich. Had they been good, it would totally be worth it - but they weren't. Salads come with one dressing but we were able to get another one, and even with two, half the salad was dry and ended up in the trash. They're large salads, but all lettuce, not much else. For the price we should have gotten a great salad, these were just meh. The Mister had a pastrami sandwich and wasn't thrilled about it. Said it was okay, and he's far from a picky eater! The worst was the seating. The highest, most uncomfortable bar style seating and tables ever. I'm petite, but these were the most difficult chairs to climb onto! Poorly designed seating area! Probably wont be back here. Too many other places nearby to spend the same amount of money for better food."}
{"text":"Located adjacent to Rio's Sport Book.  Obviously, it's titled the Sports Deli.  Usually only one line, but when it's game time, it's a long line.  The good news with a longer than usual line is that you're given enough time to decide what to order.   What to Order? -1/2 Hot Dog:  Yes it's that big and grilled to perfection. Not a hot dog fan, but you can't watch a sporting event without eating a hot dog.  -Fries: My favorite, steak fries!!  -Onions Rings:  Huge, good, but not good for you.  That's the best kind  -Burgers: Made to order and takes about 5 minutes.  Good portions.    -Fried Chicken Wings: Probably their best item.  Tasty, fresh, and breaded just right.  Prices are a bit high in my opinion ($10 for a burger), but locals get 25% off and if you have an Total Rewards Card, even cheaper.    If I'm at the Rio and want that quick something to feed my belly, I have to make a decision.   Do I wait 30+ minutes for the Carnival Buffet or do I get in and out at this deli.  I choose the deli every time."}
{"text":"I would say this place is more of a 3.5 stars but not quite a 4. We were starving when we showed up at the rio. Grabbed a burger and fries. For 2 burgers and a side of fries is was $26. A little over prices but it was really good. Very fresh tasting and cooked just right. I would eat there again. Next time I would try their hotdog. It looked awesome."}
{"text":"Ordered our food at 10:05pm, 10:20pm still waiting. Husband went to ask what the hold up was and he was told they were changing shifts! So in the meantime, you aren't cooking anything?! Heard numbers called but they were after our order. Let's hope the food is good enough to had been sitting here with 2 sleepy kids.  Update:  ordered a BLT asked if the bread would be toasted...yes. Well it's not and everything we ordered was COLD! Why? Because it sat through a shift change. The man who called our number had an attitude as well when asked which bag was ours. The best customer service we received was from the young lady who took our order-Ayuso is the name on the receipt. Not having a great Rio experience."}
{"text":"Had a decent burger here that was wrapped in lettuce, as I am gluten intolerant, and made the mistake of ordering nachos. Maybe the meat and chips were ok, but who could tell? They were drowning in disgusting canned cheese that tasted artificial - as canned cheese does. I expected more for $12 for chips. I understand that it is called a \"sports grill,\" but it is in a casino, not a ball park. Overall, I have been disappointed in most of the food, and even the water, I consumed at Rio: Not many options for gluten -free dining, and when it is, it is either a salad, or bland Pho in a bowl so big you can swim in it. I gave this place 2 stars because of the burger, otherwise, it would have gotten only one."}
{"text":"They open 24 hours on weekends. I got a matzo ball soup ($5) and potato salad ($2.95). Potato salad is good, normal stuff like you would get at a Pavilions deli. The soup I thought was really good - the broth was flavorful and there was big chunks of chicken, carrots and onions. Matzo ball tasted a little weird and mushy to me, although I can't really comment on that since this is the first time I've had matzo ball. For $5 at a Vegas hotel though? I was pretty impressed."}
{"text":"Meh. Food comes out fast and is fine for a quick bite, but not the best sandwich you'll ever have. Reuben on untoasted bread was soggy."}
{"text":"Horrible experience at my go-to sandwich place in Vegas, pretty sad about it. I ordered my usual roast beef sandwich and my friend got the cobb salad. First of all, the service was not acceptable at all. The lady had a butt-face and everytime she asked a question about how I wanted my sandwich, it's like she was yelling at me, rude! I didn't even do anything, I'm just trying to order some food biotch. After getting scowled by the cashier we picked up our food. My bread was dry, like yesterday's bread, my roast beef was too well done. Anyone who eats roast beef knows that it should be pink to light red, that's the way you eat roast beef. My friend's salad was a hot mess, too much lettuce, too much olives, not a whole lot going on there and the salad dressing was nasty. I was so disappointed because I knew this place was better than this. I won't be coming back here again. Sorry, your service and food quality sucks ass, there's too many good restaurants in Vegas to be wasting my money on something so shitty."}
{"text":"I went back to the Rio to change and get a quick bite, and this place looked safe. Run of the mill as it gets, but the prices are a total joke. It's a burger and fries, for 14 bucks! If I pay 14 bucks for a burger and fries at a walk up joint, it should at least be sufficiently kick ass. Not at all."}
{"text":"Sports Deli is a great alternative to the Rio's shoddy buffet. Featuring reasonably priced pizza, burgers, sandwiches, and salads, everything I had here was great, from the pizza to the burgers. Plus, service is fast and you can take your delicious food where you want inside the casino."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Rio for my husbands Exel trade show. Got dinner late 2 nights from here. BEST brisket/pastrami sandwhich! And the cole slaw was the best I have ever had!! I recommend this place if you like beef!"}
{"text":"Very rude employees. If you are closed or not serving certain food until a certain time that's not a problem. But you can be polite about it. Food is good but not worth dealing with the poor treatment of this cashier."}
{"text":"I don't know if it is because everything tastes good after you've been drinking, but I really liked the food that I got from here. I ordered a Reuben, and it was incredible. It was the most expensive sandwich on the menu, but came with a lot of meat and was very flavorful. The dressing came on the side, so I was able to put exactly how much I wanted on top.   I also ordered a side of potato salad and a Dr. Brown's Ginger Ale. The potato salad was better than average. The Ginger Ale tasted too 'dry' for me, and I would have preferred Canada Dry.   The service was a bit of a challenge to deal with. As I was ordering, the clerk would yell over to the cooks item by item. My order could have been taken more efficiently if she would have listened to my whole order and then told the cooks what to prepare. It took a lot longer to order than it should of, and she was already taking the next person's order before she gave me my receipt.   I did like what I ordered though, so I now know where to get a quick sandwich when I'm staying at the MGM Grand."}
{"text":"We ate here multiple times this week.  Great service, prices weren't crazy, nice size servings, food good."}
{"text":"First off, lets premise this that the deli is a walk up to a counter and order.  Let's also conceed it's more expensive than any burger king or char broiler that you have on the local corner.  I ordered the angus cheeseburger medium.  Yes, they ask how you want it cooked. I got the cole slaw and a drink too.  What's neat about this place is you can watch your food being prepared. They have several of those rotating grills like you would see at the Mongolian BBQ. They have flat top and open flame for so they can cook a burger on the open flame or a quesadilla on the flat top.    I was watching them make my burger.  What was initially disturbing was the patty they put on the open flame grill was precooked and sitting in a container.  They put it on the grill to heat it up and to melt the cheese. I'm worried that the patty will not be medium (pink in the middle) because it was pre cooked.   Amazingly when I bite into it, it's juicy and pink. I would never guessed it was pre cooked.  The cole slaw was a good mayonaise based slaw and it was crunchy enough for me to put it in the burger.  It was an excellent burger with slaw.  Based on all the factors I laid out at the beginning, I felt my burger was worth what I paid and it was better than any counter service burger."}
{"text":"Weekend they have New York steak sandwich that is terrific. Garlic Parmesan fries not bad either! Burger just ok."}
{"text":"Price is a bit high for what amounts to bar food.  Don't expect too many smiles from the people working here....and if you do buy one of their overpriced sodas, don't expect any free refills, refills are at full price.  I also have a problem when I spend $20 for food and get a tiny kiddie cup of water!  I will not be back."}
{"text":"I didn't expect much from this place but my brother had been and loved it. Service wasn't great but i wasn't there for that i suppose, food was surprisingly good so if I was staying at the Rio I eat here again."}
{"text":"I ordered nachos and a diet coke before seeing Penn and Teller. It feels like a school cafeteria. Their sandwiches look really good, but they are huge. Very solid nachos. Quick and friendly fast food."}
{"text":"1 Boulder City (pastrami w/ egg sandwich) + 12 wings (with sauce on the side)= a little over $20. For a casino eatery, this is a really good deal in my book. The wings were crispy and just a tad too salty, but as a fried chicken lover, I give these 2 thumbs up! No complaints about the sandwich either.   I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but it's a solid choice for my next stay at Rio, especially if I don't have time to leave the hotel for a meal."}
{"text":"Pretty damn good but PRICY!     While my date was passed out, I woke up hooooooooongry. I remember passing this place the day before when we had dim sum. I kept this place in mind for casual eats.  The following day I went down to get a bite and this place is not cheap BUT the portions are big and very fulfilling! I had a slice of pizza with ranch and it was damn good , great crust to dip into the ranch. I ordered my date a hoagie and its packed with fresh ingredients and they definitely didn't skimp on the meat and cheese. He couldn't eat the whole thing so I had the other half a few hours later and it was just as good as being made right then and there. No complaints from me, just expensive as hell.      If I ever find myself at The Rio again, I'll stop by for a casual bite again :)"}
{"text":"I have to stop by this place each time I'm staying at the MGM because the corned beef sandwich is just delish! The corned beef is soft and moist. I like to add cheese and coleslaw to my sandwich. Although the coleslaw lacks a lot of flavor and could definitely be better, the quality of the corned beef makes up for it.  It conveniently open late so you can come here after a long night of gambling, partying or what have you. The service is super fast! Within minutes, your order is ready for pick up. The downside is there are not many chairs and tables so sometimes you may end up sitting in those cubicles in front of the big sports televisions."}
{"text":"One of two food places open late-night at the Rio ... actually open 24 hours.  I had a calzone. (Specifically, a pepperoni calzone that had A LOT of pepperoni.) While not fine dining, it definitely hit the spot after midnight. The portion was large, and it was the right combination of greasy and grungy."}
{"text":"this place is inside the Rio.  It is the cheapest food inside the casino.  I like to go grab a bite here and watch sports because the seating area is near the sports book.  Wings and sandwiches are good."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I frequent Vegas often, we usually stay at the Rio and spend a lot of time in the Sports book watching football, so as you can imagine we spend a lot of meals in the sports book as well. The sports  deli is conveniently located right next to the sports book and offers a great variety of 'sports watching' foods. You can choose from chicken noodle soup, to a variety of sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs, and their salads are huge portions and are totally delicious and fresh! If you're in the mood for  it they also have a few baked goods to offer and either pizza by the slice or whole pizzas for sale. My favorite item here has to be their garlic fries, they serve the big steak fries and load em up with garlic goodness!!! There's usually a line but it's worth the wait cause it's good fresh food, and if you're lucky you'll get Richard making your meal, he's the main man that runs the place. He always take care of my boyfriend and my meals, and they've always been wonderful! Try it out yourself!"}
{"text":"Still in search of my favorite pastrami sandwich and this place fell short as well.  The deli was in a cool location in the hotel but they didn't even have spicy mustard ARE YOU KIDDING maybe it was the wrong day to visit but the portion size couldn't make up for the non existent necessities for a 'perfect pastrami sandwich'...."}
{"text":"This place was kind of hidden at first.  It is in the back/beside the Pho joint down in the bottom of the Rio Hotel/Casino.  After looking around at all the options of places to eat/drink, this was by thar the cheapest and fastest.  You could get salads, burgers, fries, sandwiches,  but most importantly slices of pizza.  The pizza slices were $5 and fast so that was the winner in my book. However, I suggest not ordering the garlic parm fries.  A friend of mine did and they just take their regular fries, dump way too much garlic powder on them, and dried parm.  BLAH.  That girl stuck for weeks. The salads here were great.  I suggest the greek salad.  I had many of them while there."}
{"text":"It's ok. Service was not to friendly, not unfriendly but blah... It's a bar. Your supposed to be friendly and inviting. Slow for food to come out...  Food was good and huge burger.  Problem was that it was so big it needed to be cut for someone like me with little hands to eat and the basket it was in was wire... Cut through the paper on the bottom, it was messy. I had to ask for a plate.  It's def a guys place for their massive burgers.  Oh and my mushrooms were cold on my mushroom Swiss burger... Ugh"}
{"text":"Casual, cheap and convenient. That's basically what I was looking for at 10PM on a Saturday before heading into Hakkasan. My plan was to grab a quick bite somewhere since I knew I'd later have to take up the challenge along with the rest of my friends to knock out bottles and bottles of drinks along with 40+ drink tickets we received for the VIP bottle service we requested that night.   Stage Deli serves as a casual dining spot for those looking to get a quick bite to eat in between gambling, shopping, bar hopping and what not. Located in between the nightclub, Rainforest Cafe and the MGM casino, this place is definitely easy to find. The prices here are very reasonable compared to other MGM dining spots and they are also quick in preparing their sandwiches. After placing an order on a Reuben sandwich, the order was quickly prepped and ready to eat in a matter of minutes which was perfect! I actually liked the sandwich and how tender, juicy and flavorful it was! It's definitely no Earl of Sandwich,  but it's decent and not so bad as others have expressed. There are plenty of places to sit as well so not a problem there."}
{"text":"I asked to put cheese on the sandwich the lady looks over her shoulder and yells \"hey! Put cheese on that turkey!\" And I guess the guy had already made the sandwich.  So he didn't want to go through the trouble of wrapping it up again, because we know that takes so long. So the guy decided to slice 3 pieces of cheese put it on a plate and wrap it in clear plastic. I didn't find out until I took it to my room.    The only reason this is a 3 star review and is because the sandwich was good. I asked what was in the sandwich after I paid and the lady sighed and said just lettus. Who wants to eat a sandwich with just meat and lettus. How hard is it to say \"would you like tomatoes and onions?\" especially if your paying $9.50 for a sandwich. Or at least wright that on the sign somewhere.   Next time I'll go to the food court."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, and Things. Giant Sandwiches. Their Giant Hot Dogs are Killer, with any toppings you are in the mood for. Their French fries were very good also. One of my favorite late nite snacks from this great place was The Chicken Wings.  You order by one, two, or Three Dozen at a time whatever flavor you like. They are big and juicy and cooked perfectly. Open most nights all night from 8:00am till 6:00am in the morning. Well worth the stop if your hungry."}
{"text":"Located at the sportsbook at the Rio.  Got some wings with buffalo sauce and asked for it to be sauced.  Apparently, they just give you the sauce on the side.  What was confusing was they had \"Buffalo\" sauce and a \"Hot\" sauce.  Went with the buffalo sauce though.  Also got Parmesan Fries.  They use steak fries here so if that's not your thing, you probably shouldn't get it.  What they do is have thick steak fries and just shake some grated parmesan cheese on it.  I was feeling something with meat so I got a Bacon Cheeseburger.  This was alright.  It looked good when people ordered it, but it's alright.  Nice bun and the meat got really dry after a while even after I asked for it to be cooked medium.  Otherwise, a great place to grab a quick bite.  It is pricey though.  Our meal was like $30 something bucks.  That's without any drinks."}
{"text":"Wait in line. Keep waiting. Wait some more. If they do acknowledge your existence, it will be with surliness.  Thus is the summary of the last three consecutive experiences with this place. Oh, and after all that waiting and rudeness, I still ended up elsewhere. First two times because NO ONE ever took my order - nor even made eye contact, even though they were three feet away. Last week, the entire line of people gave up after waiting for 15 minutes and went to Subway for lunch. The only person to get eye contact from an employee also got tools they couldn't get what they ordered. Something about a special code needed to make the grills hot? Meanwhile, other folks got their burgers. WTF? These people hate their jobs.  Three chances. This one was shame on me for trying again. Better service at McDonald's. And I bloody hate McDonald's.  For all those four and five star reviews, look at the dates they were written. There has obviously been a change in management. I guess I missed the golden age."}
{"text":"Surprisingly decent food. I've almost mistaken this place for a Starbucks several times and finally decided to give it a try one night after Hakkasan. They have quite an interesting selection of food ranging from deli sandwiches to Krispy Kreme donuts. Tt. I've had the beef brisket sandwich and clam chowder; both of which satisfied my hunger quite well. The best part about this place is that the service is extremely fast."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Decided to get a quick lunch and didn't want typical food court stuff.  So, checked this out.  They have a $4.99 blue plate specials.  Sometimes it comes with a side, other times it doesn't.  Today, it was the salisbury steak sandwich.  I tried it with a side of potato salad.  The sandwich was a large hoagie roll, and it was SOFT.  I was impressed, it was very fresh and a solid bread for this sandwich.  There are 2 good size pieces of steak on the bun and brown gravy.  The brown gravy was again, better than I was expecting.  I wanted more in fact, it was a very good representation of traditional brown gravy.  Other specials are hot turkey sandwich, fish and chips, etc.  I'll definitely come here again, and likely get the blue plate special again.  Very solid deal.  Drinks are $1.99 for a small, so that's annoying, but the price on the special seems to be a good deal (based on this one visit)."}
{"text":"OK, but would not try again.  Ordered a ham and cheese sandwich on wheat bread, with chips and bottled water.  Total was $12+.  The sandwich itself was incredibly ordinary.  It did come with crunchy dill pickles, which were nice to chomp on.  They did not ask if I wanted my bread toasted.    Limited seating.  I sat in the sports book area adjacent.    Accepts credit cards.  Had a few other sandwich choices - Reuben, pastrami, turkey.  A pre-packaged salad.  Krispy Kreme Donuts.    BOTTOM LINE:  No thanks.  I like the sandwiches from 7-11 better."}
{"text":"located in the RIO.. prices average $8-10 for sandwiches, pizzas, chicken wings/fingers, fries, salads or wraps... the pizzas are placed in the wood fire grill... Good spot if you want to grab a quick bite before going out..."}
{"text":"I'd skip it.  You think it will be fast since it is not full service.  It won't be.   You think that surely there must be something healthy available.  There won't be.  And you'll have the pleasure of breathing a ton of smoke while you choke down about 2000 calories of (whatever you order).  You'd think it might be cheap since the casino wants to keep you there so that they can keep making money on gambling.  It isn't."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good to grab some quick food, I actually went here twice while I was in Vegas, first time I got some chicken tenders, pretty filling, they are a lot bigger than most fast food places and they give about 5 pieces. The next time I got the beer dunk bratwursts and honestly, that thing was pretty plain, not even relish and ketchup could help it, needs some spice in it or something, comes with a full pickle at least. Nice people work behind the counter, they also recommend stuff they think is better and tell you what isn't that great or fan favorite  A-Ok in my books"}
{"text":"Small little deli next to the sports area. I was feeling under the weather and wanted some chicken noodle soup, they didn't have noodle, but they did have chicken soup and the cashier was like \"it's good, lots of chicken.\" The sign also said home made, but when I paid for it ($5) it came out in one of those black cup of noodle bowls, and tasted less stellar than the ones I'd get from a can of progresso or campbells. While the chicken itself was actual shreds of chicken, there wasn't a lot. Also the chicken soup came with a matzah ball which is like a dumpling ball."}
{"text":"Late evening service is pretty slow but the food is decent and the dining area is kept pretty clean.  You can use points to get a \"discount\" when paying for your meal.  Chili dog was only ok - nothing special but not bad either.  The convenience outweighs all else, though, when it's late and you want a quick bite."}
{"text":"Due to the limited dining options in the Rio hotel (buffet, burger king & all american grill... that's it i think) we ended up eating here about 3 or 4 times. The food was actually really, really good!! Its located right next to the sports book. Prices are pretty much whats expected in Vegas.  Try the meatball sandwich and the spicy fries!!"}
{"text":"This is the best people-watching spot in all of MGM.  Grab a table, buy a bag of chips (they sadly don't serve popcorn), get a fountain drink, sit back, and watch the hilarity that ensues when drunk clubgoers stumble out starting at 2am on the weekend.  The food's alright."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Rio and ate here a couple days.  The first time it was late but there was still a bit of a line.  Once you order it comes up in decent time.   I got a Greek chicken pita which came with fries that were very good, the price wasn't great, but for a casino it wasn't more than I would expect. The second I got a slice of supreme pizza- a friend got a sandwich and fries which were both horrible.  I think the fries had been sitting around and the pizza was this wet and mushy consistency.  It wasn't crispy at all and there was way too much cheese on top to weigh it down more.  For $6/slice I would expect it at least be edible and I was quite hungry and could only stomach about half of the slice before throwing the rest away.  For a place that basically only does sandwiches and pizza, seems weird half the product is just not good at all.  I would return if I was at the Rio and very hungry at an odd time, but certainly would not go out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"Great food and nice people. A very affordable place quick and easy access off the on Las Vegas strip. As close to being in New York as possible."}
{"text":"Place is pretty good- but expensive I got a quesadilla for $14 bucks  it was chicken - cheese and tortilla chicken wings were not good. Taste like Costco chicken wings and it was very sour Sandwiches were pretty good Expensive- good place to go if you don't want to drive and you stay at rio"}
{"text":"I call this the \"Guess someone likes me special\" All this for $6.50, very nice people"}
{"text":"OMG if i could give this place a negative star i would. $8 for a turkey sandwich which consist of 2 slices of bread,turkey meat, and lettuce.Pickle on the side and a packet of mayo. 7-11 makes better sandwiches.So disappointed.Subway was so much better.Went to panda express afterwards (food court next to M&M world) and was more satisfied and cost even less.Pay $2 more for a footlong at subway or go to food court.Can't believe this place stayed in business.Never again."}
{"text":"I was staying at the MGM Grand this past weekend.  I was playing poker for most of Sunday, but around noon I needed a little something something while waiting for dinner later that night.  The Stage Deli was right there near the poker room and there's no line.  Close and easy, two of my favorite characteristics of a restaurant.  So I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich.  The sandwich was expensive - nearly $8.00.  Kind of to be expected in a casino.  OK.  I can deal.  I'm not sure I would actually call the meat inside the sandwich chicken.  It was some sort of processed, white, rubbery chicken imposter.  ((pause))  I paused for a few minutes to think of some other substance on the planet that I could liken this chicken to, and I can't.  It must be from another world.  It was absent of any flavor, and had it not been for the lettuce, tomato and mayo i put on the sandwich, it may have been one of the least flavorful lunches of all-time.  The sesame bun wasn't very fresh.  It had that \"I've been sittin out for several hours\" taste to it.  And the pickle that accompanied the \"sandwich\"  wasn't cold and fresh; it was luke-warm and limp.  A complete let-down.  To make matters worse, the girl who took the order barely stopped talking in spanish to her cooks standing a few feet away.  I ordered and she talked right through the order.  Pretty freakin' rude if you ask me.  I'd choose 0 stars if it was a choice.  Stay away from Stage!"}

{"text":"I ate with my Mother yesterday, Sunday, July 17th at the Sports Deli inside Sam's Town. We come to Sam's town every other week or so because there's one of the games we enjoy playing there that is not available at most other casinos. Usually we eat in one of the restaurants like Friday's or the steakhouse but on Sunday we just wanted a quick meal so we decided to eat at the sports Deli. Never actually eaten there before and I doubt I ever will again due to the experience I had.   Let me start by saying that I got frustrated immediately once I got in line. There was a total of 4 people in line. 3 were in front of me, and two behind me. One person ahead of me ordered only a drink. It literally took 12 minutes before I was asked if I could be helped. The reason for the long wait was because the cashier would help a customer at the register and then begin to prepare that person's meal. She did this while there were multiple other people waiting in line. This was confusing because there were two other people in the deli at the same time cooking and preparing meals. Eventually she would finish come back take off the gloves help another person then go right back into cooking and preparing meals.   When I finally did get to the front of the line I gave her my order and paid for the meal. I then took my drinks over to the tables which I found completely trashed. Not a single table had been wiped or cleaned in the entire place. Keep in mind this was 3 o'clock in the afternoon, so the lunch rush, if there ever was one, on Sunday was long gone. You will also see by the photos that there was nobody else in the restaurant except for another couple. Nobody else stayed there to eat, and I soon learned why.     So because the tables had not been cleaned, I went to the counter and told another young lady that the table has not been wiped down. The 3 of them were helping nobody at this point, they were just chit-chatting behind the counter. Time that SHOULD have been spent having some respect for their workplace.  The young lady I told about the tables said \"one moment\" and turned around and went to the other side of the deli. I expected she was going to come back and wipe the table so I returned to the table to wait for her. A few moments later she said sir from behind the counter, and motioned for me. She then held up a rag for me to take from her.  Obviously she was expecting I was going to wipe down the table. I was frustrated at this point, so I just grabbed the rag and did the job myself.  I didn't feel that was my job but at the same time I wanted to eat.  Then I went to the ketchup mustard section to grab napkins straws and condiments, where I found the next nice little mess left by the previous patrons of the day. As you will see by the pictures there was mayonnaise relish mustard and ketchup all over the counter that is not been wiped up in ours. Most of it was hard and sticky stuck to the counter. There was mustard on the box of toothpicks sitting next to the counter which in itself is a health hazard because people are going to put those in their mouths. It also looked like this counter at not been wiped down and several hours either. There was a mayonnaise bottle there, and mayonnaise left on the counter gathers Botulinum toxin. Deadly to humans, so mayonnaise should always be wiped up ASAP.  Once I saw this, I instead asked for ketchup and mustard packages instead.   Once I got the same young lady's attention, she handed some to me.   I then returned to the table which I had wiped out myself and sat down and waited for my number to be called with my sandwiches. From the time I placed my order in till the time I had my two sandwiches was a total of 21 minutes. That means I spent over 30 minutes in this gross and unclean Deli before I even ate anything.  I chose to simply ask for to-go boxes and we took our sandwiches with us. After a while, I got to thinking it would be best if we did not eat the food from there, which we did not.  It was a waste of money, but I truly was worried about getting sick.    Needless to say I will not be returning to Sam's town anytime soon. I am concerned but the other places to eat are met with the same lack of cleanliness in the areas that I can't see."}
{"text":"Packaged pastrami individually packaged then microwaved??? Naaa....no thanks. Charge me 11 for a tiny microwavable? Double no"}
{"text":"The location is optimal; the food on the other hand.. There's nothing that makes this place special. Very plain sandwich with a couple garnishes on the side. We were definitely fooled by its architecture... I wouldn't come back.. But again, they wouldn't care because it's not like it's a \"repeat business\" kinda place.."}
{"text":"For Vegas, this is probably the best deal on snacks you'll find.  Big sandwiches, bagels and lox, fresh bananas.  Decent food, prepared well, and priced no worse than an actual deli in NYC.  Why?  It's next to the sports book at the MGM Grand.  They don't want to old guys betting on horses to leave their seats."}
{"text":"This place was so yummy.  The onions rings 5 stars crispy light and whole thick onions. Clam chowder 3 stars tasty but not worth 7.00 and lots of potatoes  Wings 4 stars, crispy and freshly made Pull pork nachos could have been better but the cheese was Luke warm.  Pepperoni pizza slice yummy thin and well done pepperonis"}
{"text":"in No way should this place be called a deli, its a sandwich shop, and a poor one, i saw a man seemed like a long sub roll, yet had only 1 thin slice of thin deli counter ham, food here is imported,, so after looking at the pitiful sandwich, i decided on just a bowl of chicken soup and a matzoh ball to go... i dont think this soup, ever met a chicken, there were slices of dried out chicken,, no vegetable carrots onion celery, NONE, it tasted like warm water, no salt anywhere, not the soup, not the matzoh ball. totally tasteless,, in fact the 3 nights i was there, i only saw that one other person, that has to tell u something, DONT GO,, go across the street to the NY NY, Greenbergs deli, a real Jewish style deli."}
{"text":"It's the most affordable place at the Rio, I ordered the MVP which two patties, eggs, bacon, jalapeño and a side of fries. (Good) 2am   Next morning instead ordering room service, I went and ordered the steak eggs $15. The steak was thin and I was worried they would over cook it, but it turn out perfect medium-rare. My GF order the bagel sandwich $12 came out nicely done.  Nothing to really wow you, but the staff is friendly. So if you're up late or want quick bite, this is nice place for it."}
{"text":"this place is awesome!   everything i've had here, i've loved!!!!  chicken wings are fried to a cripsy perfection.. tasty.  the boulder city is amaaaaaazing! pastrami.. fried egg.. cheddar.. bacon... AHHHH  YUMMOVERLOAD  their triple decker is also delicious.. pastrami, brisket, and swiss.. so good..  the hot dog is delicious. and HUGE as well!  chili cheese fries, were yummmmm. fat fries with chili generously slathered on top.. with some cheese..   their burgers are all good too.. and HUGEE  man i can't think of one thing i've had here that wasn't good.. and/or HUGE..  so bad for you, but oh what the hell... so is all the alcohol you're going to be drinking this weekend... i say, DO IT. you won't regret it..   now if you are a girl and are planning to slip into your little black dress that evening, DO YOURSELF THE FAVOR AND SHARE YOUR MEAL! lol  definitely a must try!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Deli by Sports Book. Wow!!!!! Don't miss checking out. Foods here goes so Delish when enjoying your Sports Games and betting. Onion rings are killers. Ok. Heres some Yelp Pics"}
{"text":"After a night of clubbing, we arrive back to the hotel and suddenly a wave of hunger crashes over the group . . . so we decided on Sports Deli and what a bad choice this was!  The four of us somehow all wanted the Chicken Fowl sandwich.  Wow . . . I guess I either wasn't drunk enough to realize how bad of a mistake i made, or this sandwich was so bad it sobered me up in disgust.  the bun was still frozen, the chicken was cold and soggy, the avocados were mush, (not guacamole much like thrown into a catcher's mitt mush), the bacon was a strip of grease, the cheese ran away, and apparently the menu noted onions, pepper, and \"sports deli sauce\" none of which existed.  The fries were crispy, (seems to be some sort of odd trend at Rio restaurants) but again, covered in salt.  yuck!"}
{"text":"Computers went down throughout the whole hotel..so NO credit that night. It took so long to order, the lines were long and it took forever to wait in line (since everyone had to pay cash).   Food not bad. The brat and half pound hot dogs were good. The fries were goo too!   Other than that...it was an okay experience.   Sports Deli is right next to the Sports Book..so check out the games while you're hoarding down ur half pounder hot dog!!!"}
{"text":"Stayed at the MGM and had to have come and eaten here atleast once a day to have their Matza ball soup and/or lox and bagel. Yumminess!! Soup is perfect if you've been drinking which is quite easy to do in Vegas."}
{"text":"Quick and legit deli style eats right by the madness that is the sports book and Hakkassan nightclub. I ordered the pastrami on white bread NY style which for $3 more adds 3 more ounces or so of meat. I was hungry. Dont judge me. The plate comes with sliced pickles. The pastrami had great flavor. The bread was soft. The wonder bread white loaf slices stuck to the roof of my mouth after every bite. The sandwich is served plain. You add your own ketchup via packets at the condiments table. Sandwiches are made right then and there when you pay. I also got a large soda and the total for everything was about $17 and change. Stage Deli is a nice alternative to the fast food options at the MGM."}
{"text":"I usually hit up the Stage Deli at least once when I visit Vegas. Located right next to the Race and Sports Book in MGM, it's a great little spot for a quick bite. They have the typical deli fare, but I typically go with the 1/4 pound dog and a bowl of matzo ball soup. The place is nothing fancy schmancy, but it fills the void when you're hungry and don't want to go to a typical sit down restaurant. Plus, it's open 24 hours, which is always a good thing when you're in Vegas. The prices are palatable as well for Vegas strip standards."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly service, smiles all around! Oh and specials everyday, regular menu reasonably priced!  Look for it near the Sams Town Sports Book!"}
{"text":"We ordered the asian chicken salad and the grilled cheese sandwich last night. Everything was just so bad. The cheese was not even melted on our sandwich and the lettuce was not even cut up. We had huge chunks of lettuce and our salad was just a huge, bland mess with chunks of old carrots. Definitely not fresh!"}
{"text":"Not like the Stage Deli was when they first opened in Cesar's Palace years ago. Back then it was a murky image of the Original Stage Deli in New York. This was cheap with hardly any meat, corner store rye bread. The pickles weren't good and they didn't have a variety to choose from.  Very disappointed after waddling the syrup to find the new location. Will not go again here in Vegas."}
{"text":"This deli has the best burgers and fries!  Great place for a quick snack too.  Their desserts are amazing."}
{"text":"Talk about giant size super size my sandwich why don't ya. This Sports Deli shares seating with the Sports booking area at the Rio Casino. Trust me sport fans when I say you can make a bet on your favorite game and order straight from the Sport Deli and chow down on a monster sandwich.   This place conveniently serves burgers, bratwursts, wood-fired pizzas and even breakfast sandwiches. A cool feature is the open fire pit in the center kitchen area where you can watch your burgers get its grill on."}
{"text":"Points for being quick, relatively inexpensive food that's open late, but the tuna sandwich was very lackluster. :("}
{"text":"I remember the original Stage Deli in NYC and was lucky enough to have eaten there a few times. Their corned beef,(served with a side of potato salad) --was unreal.  This was during the  \"pre-gloves\" era and they would use their hands to plop down the meat onto rye bread.   This version at the MGM is a \"nice try but no cigar\"kind of place.   The meat wasn't as moist as I would have liked it nor was the rye bread.  The potato salad was extra too...."}
{"text":"I came here because it was the most convenient place to go to and it was right next to the sportsbook. This isn't really a place you should go to if it's out of the way. The items don't come with sides, so you have to order it.  I ordered the triple decker sandwich which contained pastrami and brisket. The pastrami was decent, but the brisket killed the sandwich for me.   The spicy fries weren't really that spicy. It just had a little cayenne pepper. Not really worth it.  You should order the garlic parmesan fries instead."}
