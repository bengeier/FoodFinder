{"text":"As an American studying abroad this semester, I've been having Tex-mex  withdrawals and this place is absolutely amazing. I'd go as far as to say it's better than Chipotle-yes I actually said that. They have queso, the portions are massive, the price is very fair, the atmosphere is great, and the food tastes fresh. It's a great little place that will be a home away from home for any American tourist hoping to find some Mexican food that isn't tapas or high class."}
{"text":"This place has the best burritos you can get. I've stopped going to any other food places in Galway since they opened. They can't be beaten."}
{"text":"If you've been to America, this place is basically a copy of Chipotle in terms of how it works. However that's where the similarities stop. The staff here is way cool and the food was very good. I had a chicken burrito with pretty much everything on it, and it was so big they had to wrap it again after they couldn't close it on the first attempt! Mighty tasty!!! I can't speak for how fresh/healthy/etc everything is cooked since it is all prepared already, but it is way better tasting than chipotle! Salud & Slainte!!!"}
{"text":"One of my largest cravings as an American traveling through Europe is Chipotle. This place MORE than satisfied that craving. Lunch meal is 7.50 euro for a burrito and a drink which is a pretty good deal for quality food in Ireland. The burrito was huge, and it was absolutely delicious. Give the chorizo a try! You won't regret it.

UPDATE: I went back for a second burrito. Chicken this time. Equally spectacular."}
{"text":"Four stars for the way above average burrito. Five stars for the awesome scene. Its cheap, they were playing the Beatles, and they have a student discount. Absolutely loved it!"}
{"text":"Portions are massive! #Meat is deliciously #juicy and tastes very fresh!!!

All in all a great place to go of you need a big snack which fills you for the rest of the day :) that's value! 

The staff is really nice too..best place in Galway they say ;)"}
{"text":"Boojum is just a godsend, wherever the chain may be. This one in Galway is just as delectable as those in Dublin. There's more of a queue here usually, I think because Galway is such a student hub, but they get through it. It's just enough time to decide what you want and get your money ready. If I'm not mistaken, they don't take card, which is a pain but worth getting the cash out. Good student deals here too."}
{"text":"Getting ever increasingly annoyed at guacamole being extra. It's not a burrito without guacamole. Same for jalapeño. By the time you add the price of extras for basic ingredients up you'd be as well to cook one at home. That said it is tasty."}
{"text":"Amazing burritos and fajitas. The friendliest staff anywhere in town and a quality atmosphere with good tunes playing all the time. Average price around 7-8 euro with a drink and a pretty good selection of beers now as well. Love the place!"}
{"text":"As a California native, it's very difficult to find good Mexican good but this place is great! Even thought it's not authentic, it does the job! They have student discounts and the hot sauce here is actually hot! I've found that most hot sauce has been pretty mild. This place always has a line and it seems really popular with the locals. I'd come back here if I come back to Ireland!"}
{"text":"This place is on par with Chipotle back in the US. Good enough for me!

Boojum gives you the choice of a burrito, fajita, 3 tacos, a burrito bowl or a salad. The price is determined by your choice of filling; for instance, chicken was 6.90.

I opted for a chicken burrito and paid 85 cents to add guacamole. The employee making my burrito gave me a ton of ingredients, to the point where he had trouble rolling it all up. He also seemed new to the art of burrito making, and a more seasoned employee had to help him out.

I also ordered a side of chips and salsa (2.60). Unlike the burrito, this side did not provide the value I was hoping for. The amount of chips was ok, but the pico de gallo salsa was stuffed into a small plastic souffle cup, not enough for all the chips.

So come for the good burritos/tacos/fajitas/what have you, but skip the extra salsa."}
