{"text":"Quite good... not the best Italian I've had in Calgary. The food tends to be better on the weekends as opposed to the weekdays. The valet parking they have there is kind of goofy. There's no real need."}
{"text":"10 years ago, this was a pretty decent place. I took my wife there for lunch not long ago. We were the only patrons in the place. The food was mediocre at best and pricey. Service was almost non-existent. The light of day makes the dirt and dust apparent. The owner thinks he's some kind of a Mafia Don. Ha, get real. Time to sell it to someone who knows how to run a restaurant. The potential is great, but you can only ride Dad's coat tails for so long."}
{"text":"This place. It took about 15 minutes for someone to say hello and get our drink order...typical for an authentic Italian place because in Italy the customer service is terrible. We ordered pasta dishes and they were pretty sub par for the price point. It was bland and underwhelming but then again the food in italy is not what its hyped up to be either. The food was not memorable and the service was slow. We were one of two couples in the entire restaurant... im not sure how these people make money but its not by selling great food.."}
{"text":"We bought a groupon coupon for 1 appetizer,  2 entrees and 1 dessert. I have always driven past here and always wanted to try it but i could never afford it (mind you that was a few years ago when I wasnt making alot of money). I look at the prices now and they are comparable to other fancy restaurants in the city. We got there and our waiter was very friendly and helpful. We ordered two appetizers and paid the difference as we love calimari and we had to try it here. Then we ordered the baked escargot because we eat it once every 10 years. So we splurged. Im glad we did because it was amazing!. Then we picked two entrees and they were massive!! Overall we were very impressed and would definitely come back. Why?  $24 for an oven baked chicken with mozza cheese and capicolla italian ham w/seasoned veggies but its so big that we took half of it home. Bf ordered the seafood linguine and he usually eats a fair bit but even he had to take leftovers home. You really get value for the price you pay. Ive been to restaurants where you pay $36 for a steak entree and you have nothing left to bring home. We really enjoyed this place and glad we got the groupon coupon to try it out. We would definitely come back. Oh and the tiramisu dessery is AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"Who charges for fountain pop refills??? Osteria does. I had no idea I was being charged this and racked up an extra 20 dollars on pop. There isn't a single high end restaurant anywhere in North America that does that. Super disappointed and reminded by others how they sneak extra charges on the bill. Won't be back."}
{"text":"My cellphone died right before I walked into this restaurant . I am very disappointed, definitely not worth the price for. I will give one star for the service, it was good. The owner was friendly... Overall I wish I had stick to things I know and walked into Vero instead of them."}
{"text":"Super disappointed by our experience yesterday. We're seated, and it takes between 10-15 minutes for someone to come take our drink order. 

When the server finally does appear, he starts off by saying, \"You have a groupon I suppose?\". This rubbed me the wrong way. Did we look like we couldn't afford the menu and so he had to ask about the groupon? There must be a more polite way to ask this question, a way that doesn't make people feel bad.

He takes our order. We sit and wait for our food. There's butter on the table, but no sign of bread. Finally we get some. With our food. That pretty much defeats the purpose. The bread was cold and hard too, so it wasn't as it they were waiting for it to finish baking. The service just sucks.

I ordered the \"Seafood Risotto\". It was a huge bowl of buttery risotto and five shrimp. Not the \"seafood\" medley I was expecting.

Half-way through the meal, it gets really cold and the air smells like cigarette smoke. I look out the window to see our server having a cigarette out the front door with the door propped open. When he comes back to check on us, he reeks of smoke. 

Thanks but no thanks, we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We had a corporate Stampede event in the tent at Osteria. Food was O.K. Service was adequate. However we later discovered they double charged us over $1,000. When this was brought to their attention they agreed to overcharging us and told me they would reimburse. Three months later we had not been refunded and when we showed up in person to discuss we were ejected from the building!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, if you want to feel excluded, under-served and like you've over-spent, go to Osteria De Medici.

My disappointing experience was thus - The Osteria over-booked the restaurant on the night we had made reservations, forcing us to wait - although we had arrived on time - more than 30 minutes for our table to be ready.

When the snotty Maitre'd arrived to tell us that we were to be seated, she lead us to an 8-person table in the middle of the lounge and said that they \"we're very sorry, but they over-booked and we had to sit here\". Instead of leaving... we stayed to see how things would go.

After a good 15 minutes, the waiter came by and looked hard down his nose at us while we ordered drinks. We watched our drinks be made at the bar and subsequently sit on said bar for 20 minutes while the ice melted. 

Over the course of the dinner, our server was curt, pretentious and noticeably absent. To be fair, I don't mind an absent-esk server, many restaurants in Europe operate a \"waiters are ghosts\" serving strategy where servers zip around almost unseen serving food and refilling drinks without breathing so much as a word to the guests, save to take an order. But this server was more a poltergeist then a ghost. I felt like if we'd ordered the wrong wine, he'd sweep is starched arm across the table to knock the dishes off.

Throughout the night, many of the other servers, restaurant staff and patrons - I suspect because we were so oddly placed in the middle of the lounge or because at one point, I laughed - cast side-long glances crested with little 'harrumphs' our way. So when a more suitable table opened up near the window, we asked to move. Curtly, we were told, \"that table is not for you.\"

This restaurant would get half a star save for the food was pretty good. It was almost prohibitively expensive and grossly pretentious, but the flavor was alright.

Regrettably, I don't recommend you go here for any reason. Osteria De Medici is a \"famous\" restaurant in Calgary. The lobby is dotted with pictures of 1980s and 90s celebrities who have visited and, apparently, happily eaten. But after being treated like my money, my age or my status wasn't good enough; I simply can't imagine why it's stayed famous for so long.

{"text":"I also would like to give this place 0 stars but that isn't an option...

I got a LivingSocial deal for 4 to try this place out before we were going to see a comedy show.  Wow, we were blown away and not in a good way.  This place is supposed to be a high end restaurant...the only thing high end about it are the prices.  Now, I don't mind paying good money for good food and service but we did not get that here.

First, upon being seated we are told that the deal we paid for is not what we are getting and that each couple has to split an appetizer and dessert instead of everyone getting their own.  Fine, not too big a deal yet.  We order our food and the appetizers were ok but then the entrees come.  My wife and I had both ordered filet mignon...most pathetic steaks I have ever seen.  Normally, you would expect a thick hockey puck sized piece of meat.  Ours were so thin that you could barely see any pink in the middle to deem it a medium rare...it covered nearly half my plate!  No flavor and our vegetables were undercooked (hers) and overcooked (mine), how the hell does that happen?!?  Our friends that we had invited to come with us both ordered pasta dishes and they looked like they had been made in a single pot and then just dumped into the plate...no presentation whatsoever and both dishes were so overcooked the pasta was almost mushy.   WTF!  

The service was horrible too.  The server came by only to take our order and bring our food and never even came back to ask us how it was, lucky for him because I was tempted to send my steak back.  They then had the audacity to put a 20% gratuity on what would've been the actual bill...which normally would be fine IF WE ACTUALLY GOT GOOD SERVICE AND GOOD FOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This place may have once been a good restaurant but definitely is not now.  It is pretentious and does not have good food or service.  There is a reason why they have been repeatedly been offering deals thru Groupon and LivingSocial for the past 8 months.  DO NOT GET THIS DEAL AND DO NOT GO HERE FOR A MEAL!!  NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY!!  WANT A GOOD STEAK?  GO TO SALTLIK.  WANT A HIGHER END DINING EXPERIENCE?  GO TO BLINK!   

THIS PLACE IS A JOKE!"}
{"text":"If you want unfriendly service from a waiter who you couldn't pay to smile, and mediocre overpriced Italian food, this is your place!  

The only bright side was a decent Italian wine list you could order by the glass.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE RESTAURANT!

I have no idea how this restaurant manages to stay open , but wow, what a disappointment . Thought we would give it a try because we had no reservations , could easily get in, and because the place looks high end. 
WHAT A SHOCK, this place was a joke. Food was not good, way overpriced and the service was incredibly rude and insulting.Plus,, I'm pretty sure they overcharged us a couple drinks, but we never said a word, just wanted to get out of that place. We should of read the reviews."}
{"text":"If ZERO star is an option, I would have given them ZERO!  

If you want an overpriced disgusting food, this is the place to go.  Otherwise, save your money and go somewhere else!  Service is atrocious!  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE!"}
{"text":"I agree with the earlier reviewer who said, \"If I were able to put zero stars, I would.\"  

My husband and I, and a couple that joined us, were bitterly disappointed with our experience at Osteria de Medici last evening.

Our wine server was polite, friendly and helpful and the \"overpriced\" wine was the best part of the meal!

We were then served by an unsmiling, unfriendly waiter and the service throughout the rest of the evening was mediocre.  He served us dry, cold rolls with a dish of butter.  We had to request oil and Balsamic vinegar.  My husband and I ordered the Caesar Salad, which, in the menu, was described as Caesar Salad (Prepared in Osteria's Distinctive Way).  It was tasteless.  Our guests ordered Calimari, which they said was good so we ordered the Linguine with mussels, shrimp and calamari as our entrée.  The linguine was perfectly cooked and the mussels were tasty but the shrimp, clams and calamari were overcooked and tough.  The Tiramasu that we were served for dessert was not anything like the description on their menu (Tiramisu Osteria (Lady Fingers Dipped in Espresso Cafe and Italian Liquor Topped with Rich Marscapone Cream).  Ours was a square of moist cake covered with what tasted like \"Dream Whip\" and sprinkled with cocoa!  

Not only were we overcharged for this mediocre meal but we didn't expect to see dust along the window ledges, a wilted flower in the middle of the table that was in a silver-plated vase, black with tarnish.  We will not be returning to Osteria de Medici.  Their website says, \"Experience Excellence\" and this was very far from excellence!"}
{"text":"First, I am going to talk about the Groupon deal, it does not say in the fine print, but it does not include wine/alcohol, which I know may be common sense for most customers but I would like to disclose that. Second, the server we had tonight lamented the fact that we had a Groupon. With that in mind, he decided to check on us every 30 min, I timed it and asked him for water, which he took noticed but never came.. the restaurant was practically empty. He never bothered to check how was the food, refill our glasses, offer more bread, just courteous things a server should do. We tipped him over 20% of the total overall price ($25 dollar tip), and he immediately was attentive, and checked on us while we were paying.  Therefore, the second reason alone is sufficient enough for me to rate it 3/5 because customer service is everything to me, and my date and I shouldn't be treated any less. I understand that people have bad days but that doesn't mean that you have to be unwilling because we are college students, or whatever his reasoning may be. 

Okay, on to the food.. The food came out fairly quick. We ordered the Bruschetta as an appetizer, and it was decent! The bread was pretty soaked and not really crispy, but maybe he just forgot to pick up his order because you know... the place was 'busy'. I ordered the gnocchi and my date order the mussels, which were tasty! The entrees were solid, and definitely the star of the meal thus far. We ordered the recommended Tiramisu, and it was one-noted there was nothing that stood out, it tasted store bought. Overall, the food was decent, which might be overshadowed by the fancy decor, and modern renovations. 

The experience was so-so. I hope to whoever is reading this gives the restaurant a chance because without that mishap with the food it may be worth coming back for someone else, just not me. Osteria de Medici does have a wonderful selection, location, decorum, etc. I see a lot of positives about this place but I hope those aspects mentioned will be resolved in the near future because that's the only time I'll ever come back to this restaurant or advice any of my close friends as well."}
{"text":"1) Space. We got a tiny table in the middle of the room, right next to another table so my mother who is an S size had to move to the very corner to allow herself and the other person by the next table a little bit of personal space. They were almost touching their elbows. You could tell the original floor plan was not about having restaurant guests all cramped like fish in a bowl but the management obviously wants to make money out of every square inch of the over-priced Kensington eatery so they put extra tiny tables in the middle of the room. Having an enormous amount of tables in a little room makes it very noisy and difficult to talk. Just to visualize, the table was so small that there was no room for the bread basket AND the plate with the appetizer.  
 
2) Service. Selective: the couple next to us was served fine. They came later, got their food sooner, got their bread and butter basket as soon as they made an order, had their glasses refilled on time and had the waiter stop by and check on them. We were waiting for 15 min until the lady would come up to us, mumble something and leave a plate with butter. She never returned to actually bring bread to put butter on, passing by with 2 baskets for other guests. After I chased the waiter pointing at butter (the couple next to us who came later were already starting to eat an appetizer) he brought us bread, which was not very fresh anyway. I asked him to take away the basket to get extra room for the food brought in but he was always in a rush or simply ignored me. I ended up stacking the basket, empty plates one on top of the other in the corner of my table for the rest of the evening. 

3) Food. My mother and I got veal, which was all right, a bit plain, the appetizer was good. I wish the waiter offered ground pepper like he did to the couple next to us, but I guess he only offers it to every other table. We also had to use the same forks/knives for the main dish after we finished with the appetizer, which wouldn't be a big deal, however, the couple cramped by the next table got theirs changed without even asking. 

4) Overall. Absolutely no space, no extra napkins or a dining cloth on a table, a rushing unfriendly staff made the experience very unpleasant. Considering the prices are high (pastas start at $20), this is definitely not the classy experience you expect at a fine dinery, more of a McDonalds experience."}
{"text":"I was here for a stampede party at the tent. So I'm not sure it entirely qualifies. 

My husband was shooting the event, so a couple friends and I headed down. First thing...being sober at a stampede is surprisingly fun, cuz I can make fun of people. HAHA. The event wasn't too bad. They had a D in from Vegas Roger something or other. So it was nice to not have to listen to country. 

The set up was pretty sketchy. We had a VIP area so the boards were all off kilter and not straight and slanted. So that was annoying. Again another good reason to be sober. I didn't end up on my face. 

Then about 11 a huge fight broke out, it took the gang suppression unit coming in to break it up. And one of the girls who was part of the foundation that was being supported got hit, so pretty sad to hear that happen. 

It's stampede, some people think reality ceases to exist for 10 days."}
{"text":"I believe that the original owner must be retired or simply allowing others to run the restaurant. She was warm, friendly and appeared to care about her customers.  Last night we went for my birthday dinner and what a change.  They renovated and the tables are so small I thought I was at Starbucks.  Italian restaurants should allow you room to have many plates and glasses on the table.  We ended up having to use the ledge to balance water glasses and bread.  Service was ok..nothing to complain about.  The first they asked if we were there with the \"deal\".  That should have been the heads up to us...why would a successful restaurant be selling deals?  Food was meh..  The atmosphere was rushed..not impressed at all.  Another note: most realy good Italian restaurants close for a portion of August for them to go home to Italy.  I need to remember that for next year's birthday...."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE. Service is awful. Everyone is extremely rude. Food is only OK. Takes for ever to get a drink or your food. It's not welcoming. You feel like a burden just ordering. Definitely not worth going too. I can't say enough about how much I dislike this place. I have unfortunately had to go several times with work and clients. Every experience I have had there has gotten worse and worse. We will NEVER return. Don't know how that place stays in business. Maybe all there 'groupon ads offering half off etc. i would be scared they would spit in my good if I presented a coupon"}
{"text":"Over priced. Bad food. Rude staff. Just about every other option is better. There are a dozen nicer restaurants within three blocks."}
{"text":"This place has been recently renovated from an old-style table dining restaurant to a very nice contemporary eatery with an open, friendly atmosphere that is perfect for couples or small groups of friends.  Unfortunately, along with the renovation to the dining room, they appear to have experienced a renovation to the food that had been wonderful for decades.

What wrecked the dining experience for us last evening was the incredibly incompetent waiter, who was consistently inattentive, and who managed to look very busy while actually doing very little.

Our Caprese salad was to be shared.  For $14, we had literally two slices of tomato with two thin slices of mozzarella cheese drizzled with a nice oil and a nice balsamic.  That was it!  Not possible to share that!  It was barely enough for ONE person!

Then we ordered the calimari.  This was actually quite good in texture, but ultimately flavourless - even with the marinara sauce drizzled on it.

The mushroom risotto appeared to have been made from a box.  Perhaps it wasn't, but my teenagers can easily create a far better dish.  The rice was a bit undercooked, and while the texture was okay.....it was very bland.  Mushrooms were pleasant, but you could not tell that this was a mushroom risotto.  If I had to guess, I'd guess that it was prepared by a recent inexperienced graduate from SAIT's culinary program - that mainly teaches how to accomplish high volume food production.  This was not something I would have expected from an actual experienced chef.

The Scampi was just okay.  For $42, you get 4 scampi that are split in half on a plate.  They are supposed to be rendered in a garlic-wine sauce.  But again, very little care appeared to have been used in the preparation of the scampi that had a strong \"fishy\" odour and which was ultimately flavourless - other than that slight fishy flavour.  Not \"BAD\" - have just had far, far better from DaGuidos in Calgary on numerous occasions.

The Seafood Linguini (sometimes called Fruits de Mare or some such on Italian Menus) was generously proportioned, but it basically sat in a tomato sauce that had been drowned in a lot of water.  The whole linguini dish sat in linguini that had actually not been drained properly!  Was it prepared by a 12 year old?  My 14 year old would NEVER make such a mistake.  

The Seafood Linguini's flavour was terrible.  It is a sign of a bad chef that thinks that they can drench their food in those horrible red pepper flakes that are so spicy hot that they wipe out any other flavours.  That is what happened here.  The sauce was super spicy hot - and I don't mind spicy hot - that you really could not enjoy the dish.

The service was so slow and inattentive that we didn't bother with dessert and just went through the dairy queen drive through on the way home for banana splits.  The dessert menu looked okay - but who wants to wait another hour for dessert from an incompetent waiter?

My rule of thumb is that I start at 20% gratuity and remove 1% for every minute that I have to wait for the bill.  I was down to where the waiter should have paid me!  Nevertheless, I paid a 10% tip, which was overly generous.

Another interesting \"schtick\" is that the owner - a very nice and elegant Italian lady - walks around and asks you how your experience was.  This is silly - because if you tell her the truth, she would be devastated and you'd end up in a scene.  You just want your bad experience to be over with and hope that she can find an honest YELP review online to take heed.  

Dear elegant Italian owner lady, please heed this advice:  Fire your obnoxious waiter - even if he is Family and also fire your chef.  Invest in good waiters and a talented chef and your place would be unbeatable.  People in Calgary are wealthy and they will pay anything for a GREAT meal.  Your place is a lot less busy than it used to be because of the obnoxious waiter and the untalented cooking staff.  For now, I could not take clients to your restaurant for the reasons outlined above.  Best of luck!"}
{"text":"We got a groupon coupon for Osteria De Medici. And, honestly, the food was very good. The pairings with the wine were delectable, and the food itself rich, self-indulgent, and all kinds of delicious. We had a great time.

All of that to say, I'm not sure I will be back. It's not that the food and wine weren't awesome, it's that the regular price is very high. Furthermore, there is little vegetarian fare on the menu, which means I'm not really able to eat much anyways.

Regardless, the atmosphere can't really be beat, and the service was top-notch."}
{"text":"Excellent service, decor and food. Anti-pasta plate was delicious and so was the sweet tea. The sweet tea was a nice surprise. If I had two more hands I'd give this place four thumbs up. If I had 2 more hands then I'd also be a one man standing ovation. Go there. Eat and enjoy"}
{"text":"OMG, we have a reservation for tonight. Having read all these terrible reviews I wonder if we should be going ther at all.   Geez, why post reviews if the restaurant doesn't care what customers think.  Word of mouth speaks volumes.  Open your eyes Osteria!"}
{"text":"It pains me to give Osteria De Medici 3 stars.  So much so that I may try and convince my fiance to go back for another try, just so they have the chance to redeem themselves.  But our first experience was disappointing, to say the least.

We went to Osteria De Medici to celebrate something (anniversary of some sort, I believe).  Being in Kensington and having had friends who previously worked there, I was excited to try it out.  We had heard great things and of course the multitude of stories about the varying celebrities who have dined there.

The decor and atmosphere is very nice, but I was a little put off by the clear windows.  I've done it myself, walking past the restaurant and peering in to see who is in there.  From the other side of the glass, it's pretty annoying.  There are places to sit to avoid that, but it's not where we were placed.

The server we had was really good, at first.  Unfortunately, his lack of focus is what ruined the dinner for us.  Quick disclaimer, be weary of going to high-end Italian restaurants if you don't eat pork.  Your options become very limited.  And that is what caused our experience to sour.

We sat for some time looking through the menu trying to figure out what didn't have pork.  Not being Italian, we had no clue which dishes clearly had pork, so we asked our server for some assistance.  In his defense, we didn't outright ask \"which items don't have pork\", we simply pointed to different items and asked if they had pork or not.  We finally settled on one that didn't appear to have any pork, but once again in his defense we didn't directly ask him if it had pork.  But really, he probably should have picked up that we were trying to avoid picking a dish that had pork in it.

When our meals arrived, we started eating until my fiance discovered pork in her dish.  Essentially, the chicken was stuffed with it.  So we had to send it back; after some time they brought back the same dish but without pork in it.  My guess is that the pork makes the dish, because it ended up being pretty bland and boring.  My meal wasn't much better and we ended up eating separately.

So what could have they done differently?  Well, picked up on our avoidance of pork for one.  Secondly, when we had to send back her meal, it would have been nice for them to offer to take mine back as well until the other one was ready.  But they didn't, the experience was ruined, and it will likely be difficult to convince my fiance to return."}
{"text":"I came here a number of years ago because it was a place that everyone in my family wanted to try. 

We were disappointed in it.

I remember the service was not that good we had to wait a while to get our food.

Everyone ordered the fish that was on special I believe it was salmon but I can't be 100% sure.

In any event it was not that great. It was really dry and had very little taste to it.

I would not go back here It was overpriced and in my option the food was not that good."}
{"text":"I also agree with the \"zero star\" assessment. We are from Edmonton and were in Calgary for our engagement shoot, and wanted to grab dinner before heading home.

Service was atrocious. We were seated and it took 10 minutes before someone took our drink order (our server was also acting as the bartender, and was more overly concerned with flirting with the two riggers at her bar than serving us)

We ordered starters, and kept asking for bread which she said she'd bring over... after asking 3 separate times for bread it finally appeared- cold with hard butter. 

We had finished our appetizers and our dirty plates sat there while she continued flirting & giggling at the bar. I could hear the kitchen shouting \"order up\" and since there was only 4 other people in the restaurant I knew that was our food, but the server blithely carried on, not listening.

From the time we sat down until we got our entrees it was 52 minutes. AND THE RESTAURANT WAS NEARLY EMPTY.

The portions were tiny. I took one bite of my extremely fishy tasting and dried out pasta and decided I was over it. I waited for her to return to do a quality check, (which didnt happen) so we had to call her over.

I asked to have our dinners packed up because we were leaving. She handed the To Go boxes to my fiance, and made him package them.. which I thought was so tacky for a supposedly \"fine dining\" restaurant.Then started to act all concerned as to why we were leaving and started piling on the sweetness (clearly now concerned for her gratuity)

I paid the bill, left no tip, and we went to Pete's Drive In instead. When I got home I fed the overpriced leftovers to our dogs.

WILL NEVER GO BACK.

I'm fairly certain they are only still in business because of their location.The restaurant wasn't clean, service was terrible, and food was disgusting..all for a premium price."}
{"text":"Ahh, Osteria Medici... So here is the story. We were eating out after a rather nasty week in the office, going wherever. Driving past a classy-looking building, and K-man is like: \"Here's some Italian place, let's go there? what do you think?\" And we were like - ok, we are hungry.

So we sort of park that rental Malibu and dropped in. The place looked, well classy inside, too. We have been seated at a nice round table, and all the expensive forks and crusty napkins and stuff were around, intimidating. And the guys were like: \"Ok Sergey you know about wines, so why won't you choose one to start?\"

I am confidently pulling out a menu and start browsing. And smiling. And browsing and smiling more and more. And I'm like: \"Hey people, the cheapest shush here is about seventy bucks a bottle, but that should be some garbage - are you into something like hundred and fifty a bottle?\"

And the waiter was like: \"Oh sure sir, but that's cheap as well - real good stuff starts on this page... And oh yes, like five hundred a bottle and up. So we kinda laugh (awwwkwaaard...) and choose something reasonable, and well, there went plates, and one of the girls was like: \"I am going for a dessert only, this is it!\"

Anyway, the food was surprisingly ok. Surprisingly - because for that amount of green president faces it should have been smacking awesome! Same as the size of the portion. Main course look and feel was like an appetizer. Service was obviously top-notch, they have not even laughed at us too much - what can you get from such a bunch of cheap rats...

They've also messed up - brought a plate with some pork without asking and failed, as one of us was a Muslim. At the end of it we've finished the dinner and went away with a wind blowing through our pockets - still hungry - and only then noticed a board next to the entrance. And on that board there were the photos of all those funny people who have visited the place on their trip to Calgary - like Luciano Pavarotti, some astronauts, president Clinton (or something) and so on. Cool place we've chosen - laughed at ourselves a lot! :-)

And just a couple of weeks later there was a story with Oilers busting like fifty thousand bucks at Osteria Medici and refusing to pay because they were still hungry, and such a stars, and so on - so, see, we were in the same league with celebrities! That alone was worth parking that freaking Malibu in a rather dense setting..."}
{"text":"Proper, authentic Italian food. A classy establishment for those looking for a classic option. Modern but not overly so like most restaurants in Calgary try to adopt."}
{"text":"I was a guest at a Stampede event and had a full day's experience with Osteria De Medici.  The Stampede tent itself is well done in terms of comfort and room.  I was with a party who reserved their own section, so we had cushy seating and our own server.  She wasn't always around to help us when we needed it, but I'm not going to complain that I got to play bartender a few times.  That was fun.  I just really enjoyed the experience overall and Maurizio, the General Manager, was very welcoming.

I ate several meals here.  One included traditional Stampede fare with steak, potatoes and beans.  I NEVER eat steak and I couldn't help but eat this because it melted in your mouth and was spiced well.  I don't know what red wine was served but it was fantastic.  My second meal was Penne Al Salmone and a few other items to share, which I didn't order myself and cannot remember what they were (it was a long day of celebration).  What I can tell you is that my dish was very fresh, creamy and delicious.  I couldn't finish it so others at the table polished off my leftovers.  

The only downside is that the women's restroom was \"out of order.\"  I snuck in and used a functional toilet anyway, but the lights were low, so it was moderately challenging.  I'm sure they were hoping to encourage everyone to use the portable toilets beside the tent.  

Based on the overall price range of this restaurant, I'm very grateful to have been a guest but will return at least once for a more authentic experience."}
{"text":"Have wanted to come back here for some time and decided what better place for a birthday lunch. Service was attentive and the food was outstanding. Risotto was very good and beautifully presented. A little expensive but noted the table next to us purchased a groupon for lunch, something I will consider for next time. Definitely want to return for dinner."}
{"text":"If I was able to put zero stars I would.

We used them for a Christmas function.  The food was OK, but just OK. Some of the servings didn't even arrive, but all told food was average.

The big nasty happened later when we got the bill. It was thousands of dollars more that agreed upon. When we broke down the bill, it turns out the people drank and average of 18 drinks each. Many of the drinks were handed out at the door with the impression they were complimentary, but they were actually 12 dollar drinks on the bill.  Maybe a couple of people could have gotten to the 18 drink mark, but about 10% of our staff are non-drinkers, and most couples had a designated driver, so it's very unlikely.

Service was not very good. Servers and management alike were often rude."}
{"text":"Went the other evening as I continued to push the limits of my expense account.  

I'll admit that Osteria wasn't my first choice but since my customer was picking that's where we went.  I had made reservations earlier in the day so was annoyed that when we arrived (5 minutes early and before the dinner rush) we were told our table wasn't ready.  

Once seated we seemed to cycle through 3 different waiters/waitresses.  Not good as it caused some confusion but more on that later.

Our appetizers (prosciutto & melon, shrimp and carpaccio) all seemed as they had been prepared for an earlier service.  The prosciutto and carpaccio were dried out and almost crunchy and the shrimp were soggy (yuck).  Our mains were anything but inspired.  Not bad per se just exceedingly average.  Two of us has pasta dishes which looked as though they came from a steam tray (vs. being prepared fresh) and one had a veal dish that in her words was \"painfully bland\".  Again, nothing that tasted off or was foul tasting but it was more along the lines of what to expect from a food court vs. a restaurant that attempts to bill themselves as high end.

As a conclusion to the meal the messed up our bills.  I can say with absolute certainty that no one from our table asked for separate bills (why would they, everyone knew I was treating) so when our last waiter showed up with three checks it came as a bit of a surprise.  If I was paying for it myself it wouldn't be an issue, just would have said run my credit card three times.  But knowing our accounting department and how picky they get submitting three different receipts as one dinner would cause grief, so I asked to have them put everything onto one check.  Wow, the look I got was stunning! Then the waiter brings over the manager who asks \"so what the hell is the problem?\".  Excuse me?  I'm trying to take customers out for a nice dinner, I don't want to create a scene and didn't appreciate the snarky attitude."}
{"text":"I'm pretty surprised by all of the negative reviews here. Osteria De Medici is one of my family's favourite restaurants! We go there fairly often and the service is consistently fantastic. We've tried majority of the items on their menu and everything is delicious. We always leave extremely full and satisfied. Plus- every so often the owner comes around and checks up on everyone. I have a lot of allergies/ dietary restrictions and they're always very careful to get my order right. The place is quite nice too. Not a single bad thing to say!"}

I don't think I have EVER experienced such horrible customer service in my life.

My boyfriend and I pre-purchased a Living Social coupon for this place which entitled us to fritatas and mismosas on selected afternoons during stampede.We chose one of the selected dates and called the night before to make a reservation for 11:30am the next day (figured we should make a reservation since it could be busy being stampede and all). The reservation was confirmed no problem and we informed them that we would be using our Living Social coupon and this was alos confirmed no problem. 
We planned our day around coming here from brunch. Anyway we show up for our reservation and the host or whoever came over to assist us VERY RUDELY told us that they \"were not ready for that deal\" and that it was a misprint and they would not serve us. We told him about our reservation but he brushed us off and would not even look at our coupon that we were trying to show him and would not even make any attempt to offer an alternative or apoligize.He then just walked away while we were trying to ask him more about what was going on. We started to leave but then decided we deserved some kind of explanation on what to do since we had already pre-paid for this meal with them. The same man came back over and this time told us \" look guys we aren't even open this early, but you can come in and have beef bun instead if you want\". I asked him \" if you are not open this early then why did you accept our reservation for this time when we called last night\". The guy didn't answer my question and just walked away again. We decided since we had already pre-paid for a meal and were very hungry that we may as well go in and have the beef bun he offered. So we sat down and after waiting 15 mins and have nobody even so much as acknowlege us we decided to leave. On our way out another man (which I think may have been the manager or owner) asked us if we were going to stay. We explained to him that nobody had come to serve us so we decided to leave. At this point I was so upset that I can barely recall what this man was saying to us but he was also very rude and dissmissive when we explained our problem. He was also not willing to offer a solution or alternative. And told us \" we can't offer that during stampede\". So why did you make the deal in the first place then?? And if you can't honor it then at least offer an alternative.

I have previously worked many years in the customer service industry for Fairmont  Hotels and Resorts as well as Four Seasons so I know what should be expected on a customer service level, especially a place that is supposedly \"upscale\" and I have never been treated so rudely as I was here. If they could no longer honor a deal that they made and customers pre-paid for then they should have been prepared with an alternative and still treated us to the same level of service that they would any customer. We had actually pre-purchased another Living social coupon here as well which was for a $99 wine pairing menu. We have asked for a refund on this as we no longer have any desire at all to ever come back here. In fact you couldn't pay me to enter this place again. We eat out at least 3x a week and live in the Kennsington area so could have easily been repeat customers had they treated us properly. 

Kensington is a beautiful, unique area in Calgary that does not need this buisness. Would love to see something worthy of Kensington go up in this location instead."}
{"text":"Incredible food! Our selection was amazing especially considering we had a groupin we had so many amazing options! Such a value! We sat in the dinning room and loved the ambience but the place could use a little dusting. Our server warmed up to us as the night went on but was always professional and very attentative! Thank you for helping us celebrate our first year of marriage here!"}
