{"text":"This weekend is the \"soft opening\" of a The Covenant, situated on the northwest corner of Tatum and Shea. The Camelback corridor from Central Avenue east, the Arcadia area and of course Old Town and North Scottsdale have seen the birth of and a recent surge in some of the finest dining in the Country and now \"The Covenant\" brings 5-Star dining to a place where Paradise Valley-Scottsdale-North Phoenix intersect.    The atmosphere is open, bright, modern and unique and suited for young and old alike.  You would guess that there are tons of kinks to work out on the first night or two of business, but what they pulled off was flawless.  We were expecting long waits to get in, long waits to order and even longer waits for the 900 degree kitchen to produce our orders, but it was all obviously well thought through and rehearsed.  The staff all look like they are old pros at the food and beverage industry; no beginners here.  The menu is wonderful because it offers about a half dozen appetizers, but they vary so much that you want to try them all.  Nothing routine here.  Our favorite was the Charcuterie Board - a large portion of Prosciutto, Schrieners sausage,  roasted Piquillo peppers, honeycomb, Sea hive cheese, Point Reyes bleu Cheese and a delicious house bread.  There are only 9 or 10 entrees but like the appetizers, the variety is so great, that the menu is anything but boring.  We had the Tomahawk Steak - a flame roasted bone-in ribeye steak that was possibly where the 900 Degree Kitchen concept works best.  It melts in your mouth and was perfectly prepared to order,  The cut is so large, the bone is probably at least a foot long. We also ordered the Half Roasted Chicken which sounds ordinary enough, but it's mouth-watering and has the most amazing seasonings I've ever had on chicken.  It comes with fingerling potatoes, roasted veggies, charred lemons and a micro salad.  We also ordered the Chef's Cheddar Mac (Mac 'n Cheese) with andouille sausage, smoked wild Mexican shrimp, and a tasty trinity pepper relish.  We ordered a couple of desserts for the table that included chocolate panna cotta and a gelato affogato which was amazing.   They offer a variety of salads and of course some amazing looking burgers and sandwiches.  They will serve brunch on the weekends and I believe they're going to be open for lunch and dinner 7 days a week.    This is a great destination whether you're in Phoenix, Scottsdale or Paradise Valley.  The prices are extremely reasonable, with the Tomahawk Steak (which honestly is enough for two people) at only $59, which is a giveaway for Tomahawk.    The official opening is this Monday (August 28, 2017) according to the sign. The staff was amazing; starting with the valet, the folks greeting us at the door, our server, all of the managers and GM and even the owner.  The bartender (didn't catch her name) was all over it and the bar, which I'm guessing seats 25 is a great place to drink and is so spacious that everyone seated at the bar were eating full dinners, yet it's bar intimate too.  Plenty of large screens at the bars with a variety of sports playing.  Five Stars for sure."}
{"text":"The food was way overpriced and didn't taste that great. $17 for a burger plus $5 for a side. Crab cake was salty and $16. Wine was $14... wife had a chopped salad with chicken and they forgot the dressing. why? You need to revise your menu with better items (pizza and ribs are good for 900 degrees) and reduce pricing on drinks and food soon or you will be going the way of the dinosaur quicker than you think. It's early enough to make these changes and win back a big portion of customers but I have a feeling your rent was so high due to the TI you did and your margins are barely clearing."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last week and it was an awesome experience.  Went out with my wife and another couple.  We tried a little bit of everything 3 apps(Try the octopus), 4 specialty drinks, We all had meals and shared(Salmon, Steak, Chicken & Scallops).  The salmon was everyone's favorite.  The main course was very filling.  It wasn't ala carte.  It was a full meal which I thought was a great value.  Deserts were also really good.  The food presentation I thought was also one of the highlights.    The DÃ©cor is absolutely amazing in my opinion.  Great concept.  Fun furniture and it works with the concept well.  The service was timely and on point.  The manager came over at the end to thank us for coming in and we all spoke for a few minutes.  It was really nice.  I would definitely go back and recommend others to go as well.    Thank you for a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service, awesome appetizers. Crab cake was the best I've had in a lo"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Amazing service! Amazing Owner!!!  We had our annual girls dinner here and ordered half the menu!  There wasn't a thing we didn't love.  I'll be back soon with the Husband."}
{"text":"Obsessed! The decor, the bar stools, the cocktails and food! Everything is 100! I would bring a big group of girls and share the yummy hummus and veggie boards or bring my husband for the insanely good meat plates! This place won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Fantastic service & good! Had scallops and side of smashed potatoes. And lavender espresso. Wow!!"}
{"text":"Very excited to get a new restaurant in the neighborhood, we stopped by on Day 1. Food was average at best - service was ok and we paid 145 bucks for 2 kids meals, 2 appetizers and 2 entrees priced at 25 each! We had no dessert and 1 drink priced at 12 bucks. A kids grilled cheese sandwich came out with crispy bacon and yellow tomatoes. I am all for healthy eating for the kids but it was too much. I wish them the best but was hoping for a better dining experience. The layout and ambience is nice."}
{"text":"Just opened, so they must be learning how to do it. I hope they can train the staff and improve, I really do. Our server was inattentive and could not get the orders right. My friend ordered her cocktail 3 times, and it never came. So she was finally given a drink on the house, but then she said it tasted awful and she did not want it.  I ordered a green salad with roasted veges. They tasted like soap. I can't imagine what is going on in that kitchen! Hostess was very nice (again), and I was not charged. Another friend had a glass of wine, small cup of soup, a tiny side salad, a tiny bowl with a piece of octopus and her bill was $38. Very little food served for so much money. Someone said the scallops were good. On the positive side, the decor is lovely to look at, so just go for a glass of wine and look at the light pretty fixtures."}
{"text":"The menu has a great variety & dishes are well executed but everything is over-priced, even for this area. My husband & I got 1 entree, 2 apps (I ordered one as my meal) and 2 glasses of wine for a total of $96. No wine by the glass under $15. Some dishes over-salted and the cut of chicken was average (lots of dark meat)."}
{"text":"Lunch on Labor Day, after this new restaurant in our 'hood had a few weeks to get the kinks out. Billed as a \"wood-fired kitchen\" we went expecting rustic choices and definitely pizza. Sad sacks here. Instead it was a swanky, mirror, crystal and Tiffany blue retro-fitted ex-shoe store with a trendy and expensive menu to match. Pretty, yes but definitely for a bar crowd who wants to be seen and prob better (and even more spend) at night.   Seared tuna banh mi sandwich had the right flavors and the beef and bleu burger was good but it was a speedy little outing more appropriate for those who want some sparkle."}
{"text":"Service is NOT their forte. After being greeted with a hearty \"I have a table for you but you have to be gone by 7\". It didn't get any better considering it was before 5 p.m. and the restaurant was mostly empty. The south wall of windows was dirty, as was the stem of my wine glass, but no one seemed to care. My Malbec was served too warm and they served the desert with a spoon that clearly needed a knife and fork, which the table next to us got. The food was good, but nothing else was.  We never saw a manager and no one asked how our evening was. It's a shame no one cares. However we do and we won't be back."}
{"text":"First of all, we are fans!  A great place for lunch or dinner - I've had both.  The vibe is great with good energy and not too noisy.  Even at the height of Fri happy hour, the noise level was OK.  Food was very good and the service was exceptional!  Our server, Emir, was professional, thoughtful and very personable.  He chatted with us just enough to understand what we wanted in our dining experience and steered us to the right choices.  And this guy was busy on a Friday evening!  The menu is varied with good choices for everyone, and the 4 of us enjoyed everything we ordered.  Crab cakes, charcuterie, fish special of the day, scallops - yummy all around!  And don't miss the apple tart for dessert! A new favorite for us."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an appetizer and a little more vino and ordered a bottle of Spanish Albarino.  They had it but it had recently arrived and it wasn't chilled.  So I passed and ordered a nice Oregon Pinot Gris.  Which was a very nice bottle.  About half way  into the bottle and enjoying a nice charcuterie board.  All of a sudden Brian, the manager, stops by, apologizes for not having the wine ready and chilled and comps our bottle of Pinot Gris and says the Albarino will be chilled and delivered shortly.  Needless to say we stayed longer had more apps and are now customers.  Great first experience and impression. Food was tasty besides the board we had crab cakes and ceviche."}
{"text":"First time here it's new, absolutely beautiful very tastefully done the menu looks great although we have not eaten yet but so far this place is really really nice"}
{"text":"This was a fun place to get together for ladies night to have a cocktail and appetizer. The staff was pleasant and the food was decent. Everyone else with me seemed to enjoy their time as well. The wine was great and they have such a unique feel. Would love to go back in to try their coffee bar!!!"}
{"text":"The parking was great. Atmosphere was big, open and a bit loud. It's new and it was packed. So to be expected. The service was amazing. And the food was just OK. I think it was a bit overpriced but it did taste good.  The bartenders were amazing.  Gemini is seasoned and killed it. Andrea was my favorite. She has a super personable attitude. Over all....it was 4 stars. Would have been 5 but a bit over priced."}
{"text":"Gorgeous restaurant!! Absolutely stunning decor throughout - even the restrooms are beautiful! We came after church for brunch.   I had the salted caramel cappuccino which was very good and ordered the chorizo gravy and biscuits with  two eggs over easy. The chorizo gravy was fantastic but I had to order an extra side of it because there wasn't quite enough for the biscuits.  Service was excellent. My husband ordered the corn beef hash with two eggs Sunnyside up. The eggs were a bit too runny and the corn beef hash had big chunks of corn beef in it and it wasn't as good as it could've been.  I also ordered a side of the tomato soup and it was delicious.  My husband wasn't as impressed as I was but he wants to go back to try other things so we will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch. I would give it 5 stars except the server was overly, weirdly flirty. One other reason for just 4 stars was the unnecessary complication and messiness of the chicken sandwich. I honestly have no idea what I was tasting. It wasn't bad tasting or anything but way too much crammed in there!! Now for the good stuff. The Tuna Poke was phenomenal. Best I've ever had. I could live on it! It's a large portion for a starter and fabulous!! it's sooooo yummy!! Will definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"Came in for the first time, our server Jordan was prompt profession and knew the menu completely and reccomended great food. Excellent service and food was fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"First time here. Tried braised short rib ravioli. Delicious. Friendly and knowledgeable bartenders at the bar. I will be back!"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to come here since the opening but could never find a time.  We are so glad we finally got an opportunity today. Amir said he would take care of us and he did a phenomenal job but none of that would have mattered absent good food.  We had a great meal of poke, octopus and scallops. Each dish was excellent from very flavorful poke to tender octopus in an amazing broth to a fantastic scallop dish  We already made plans to come back an we are looking forward to it."}
{"text":"The drinks are great but the scallops are TO DIE FOR. Husband had the tomahawk steak which was huge and had a very Instagram-worthy presentation.  The ambiance is fancy-casual:  you want to dress up, but the music makes it feel like you are hanging out in a friend's living room.  Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"PROS 1. High quality food 2. AMAZING decor (looks much better than the bar pics shown on yelp) 3. Great neighborhood vibe 4. Friendly crowd  CONS 1. Entrees are about 25% more expensive than they should be for what you get"}
{"text":"My wife and I and another couple tried this restaurant for the first time last weekend and thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere, food and service.  John was our waiter and he did a great job in telling us the history of the ownership, how the food is cooked, etc.  We are big fans of O.H.S.O. And were happy to hear that the owners of O.H.S.O also own The Covenant.  I would highly recommend this new restaurant!  I had the short ribs and my wife had the ceviche - both dishes were prepared to perfection and again the service made the evening!"}
{"text":"Service is amazing!! Carissa was our server and she was great!! And brian Kenny was great, showed us different whiskeys and let my date try a new one! Awesome place and food is very tasty!! They do have a happy hour 3-6 Monday-Friday that we will have to try soon!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor. That is about all that is good to say. Food is bland and uninspired- if I'm paying $59 for a steak I should not have to add salt and pepper to have flavor. Pricy and blah food- menu sounds good but food just isn't."}
{"text":"A trendy happening spot with an art-deco dÃ©cor. I frequented this new restaurant for happy hour and was very impressed with the service and menu...Caters to a more upscale 35+crowd, which I was cool with. I will be back to patronize this new business! Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and was disheartened after all the buildup. Service was mediocre which I'll say bc it wasn't busy but we had to wait every time for people to check on our water, ask for a check, etc. I got the beet and goat cheese salad with shrimp. The beets were chilled which sort of robs them of flavor. The goat cheese was slathered between the beet slices and so was also chilled and basically beet flavored instead of contrasting with the beets. The shrimp were well cooked but i chewed some grit twice so was all around underwhelmed. We'd been anticipating this place for a long while so it was a big bummer. Maybe they're still just getting their legs under them, but don't know that for the prices, i would risk another meal..."}
{"text":"Our first time here we liked the atmosphere and sat at the bar for lunch. The menu is savory and I liked the grilled cheese and tomato soup. We will come back"}
{"text":"I cannot give enough stars to this restaurant! The food, ambience, drinks and service, all A+. Special shoutout to Craig and Brian who are two of the best workers I've ever had the pleasure to meet! This place does not disappoint and has become a for sure stop during my AZ visits."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like the Covenant.  The atmosphere is nice but the food and service is terrible.  We tried 3 times but food was never worth the price."}
{"text":"Beautifully crafted cocktails, great wine selection and fresh locally sourced food paired with exceptional service makes for a beautiful night in the valley of paradise. Upscale but we'll priced spot for dining and drinks in Paradise Valley, great for locals and worth the drive for everyone else. All the hot-food is made in the wood-fired oven and our meal was on the money. We started with a rum cocktail and the pear cocktail and the charcuterie board. The cocktails we're well balanced and a beautiful start to the meal. The fresh home-made pit bread was great with the board and I couldn't get enough of the home-made sausage. We had the short rib entree and the tomahawk steak with the farm salad. All were delicious and you can't go wrong with the steak but the short ribs really nailed it. We finished with the afogatto and the panacotta paired with some wine and another delicious cocktail. All of this delicious food was followed by courteous and prompt service. We've already picked out our next three meals! Needless to say we highly recommend The Covenant!"}
{"text":"Wow, wonderful meal!  Loved the charred octopus appetizer.  Both the chopped salad and short rib entrees were big potions and even bigger flavor.  The dessert Triple Delight with coconut, chocolate, and Carmel over a cookie cake and topped with berries was amazing.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We were there for brunch. Very creative menu with exceptional flavor. Biscuits with chorizo sausage gravy excellent, as was the Mexican bowl and the corned beef hash. Yum!"}
{"text":"The decor was really cool in this place. Loved the liquor selection. They had a very thorough selection of whiskey. Open kitchen so you can see what was going on. Drinks were good. We sat at the bar and got to talk to the bartenders. They offered excellent suggestions. Got drinks and an appetizer. I will say it took 30 min to get our bruschetta. Other reviews did talk about the slow kitchen service. It's still a new place though so hopefully they get their groove."}
{"text":"Had lunch today at this new restaurant.   The Decor is beautiful... very cool place. My two business companions felt the place was very feminine.  They did say best Hamburg they have had!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for awhile, and I have to say I was unfortunately disappointed this morning when my husband and I met friends for brunch.  The pros: the atmosphere is amazing! I loved the bright light coming in the windows and the trendy decor. The food was good too. I wouldn't say great amazing food, but good. Bloody Mary was very tasty!  Cons: our server seemed out of it- I asked if they had sparkling rose' and he said he \"didn't think so\" so I got the previously mentioned Bloody Mary instead. After seeing 3 or so glasses of what appeared to be sparkling rose' go to other tables, I looked more closely at the menu and saw that they do in fact have it. I guess I should have just checked for myself to begin with but I assumed the server would be aware of that info!  I asked for no onions on my order and it came out with onions. My friend ordered the melon and feta salad and it came out without feta (??) so she had to ask for some. My husbands avocado toast was TINY- picture 4 small crostini bread pieces with avocado spread instead of the traditional avocado toast for $12 (or $14 if you add one egg like he did.) just seemed overpriced! Service overall seemed slow as well.   I really had a different idea in my head of what this experience would be and I'm bummed it wasn't what I expected. I'd maybe come back again for happy hour to avoid the high meal prices and I'd sit at the bar to hopefully avoid any delays in service, but even then I'm not sure I'd come back, unfortunately"}
{"text":"Fabulous decor, ambiance and service. Amazing Apps, salads, steak and scallops!! Definitely a very happening place and should be next on your list to try!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best corned beef hash I've ever had. Very pleasantly surprised. Service and decor are both top notch. Highly recommend. 6 year old really liked his cheese pizza and he's pretty hard to please."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Carmel lattes... yes please! Happy hour is good and dinner is good. Most of all I love the ambience here."}
{"text":"Came tonight for dinner w two friends.  Right off the bat, I was a little annoyed w parking but did use the valet (who were super nice!)  We walked in and the place is pretty cool.  The chandeliers are gorgeous and the details of the decor were nice...will say we were a bit confused by the tvs playing sports, as this appeared to be a place that was attempting to give a more upscale vibe.  Smaller menu, but the food all sounded delicious!!  I was really excited about the melon and feta salad!  Our server was Drew and he was nice.  For drinks, we ordered an OHSO beer, a glass of \"complicated\" Chardonnay (which Drew said was recommended by owner, explaining she had chosen all the wines), and a lavender cappuccino.  For dinner, I had the melon and feta salad and added Mexican king prawns (delicious!!), and my friends had the short rib ravioli and the grilled cheese/tomato soup.  All the food was excellent!!  The cappuccino was delicious, but the wine was just average.  Was a little disappointed in the price points for the wine by glass.  Overall, good food, decent drinks, inconvenient location, good service.  I would go back again!"}
{"text":"Hey Hey Hey everybody ...let's give a warm welcome to this newly found gem ! They have only been open three months . This place will become a favorite for many . The Covenant is sleek and fresh from the decor to the food . They support local farmers and use organically fresh produce and ingredients ! It's delicious and your taste buds will thank as always don't take my advice try it for yourself . If you go let me know what you think . Enjoy !"}
{"text":"So last night my husband and I dined at The Covenant Sunday, Oct. 29th, 2017, greeted with great decor and bold colors.We decided to take a seat at the bar since it was date night and sitting at the bar is always more fun! Our bartender wraps up his conversation with the other guest and says a quick hello and gives us two menus and glasses of water. No introduction or information on the space (We found out later that it was 2 months old so he should have been way more excited to have us in explain what the Covenant was all about.) So, we dive into reading the menu and we go over every part. ( I LOVE READING MENUS) After a few minutes, my husband and I decided to try the glass of absent-minded professor with   1/2 roasted chicken and vegetables and the Nicoise salad. The wine was average nothing special and serviced in a very cheap feeling wine glass.  We get our food in a timely manner which was great, or so I thought. Presentation for the chicken was okay but the flavor was terrible, the dark meat was a weird round thing that I have never seen before, the white meat breast was SUPER unflavored it was like they forgot to season the meat.I tried the potatoes which were average potatoes without seasoning and STEAMING hot, then I tried to take a bite of the carrots which were ICE cold, a completely uneven dish. I had to ask for something different because the chicken made me feel as if I was at Boston Market not $19 worthy. So while I waited for the short rib ( the bartender's recommendation )  I tried my husband's salad, it was flavored right but not presented in the typical Nicoise salad with the heavy portions they are supposed to have. The salad had very little tuna on the salad, but none the less average tasting salad. Finally get my new meal and right away I am already seeing uneven knife skills in their \"roasted mirepoix\" there was a very large piece of onion along with uneven cuts of carrots, and celery. I wanted to give it a shot so I dug in, and again everything was unevenly cooked with no seasonings. On one side of my plate the carrots were hard and the other side, they were overcooked and tasted like plastic.  The beef was not seasoned at all it screamed for flavor! The farro risotto was the only thing that was a tiny bit eatable but then again it needed salt and pepper.  After this being a second disappointing dish I told the bartender I couldn't stomach another poorly executed meal. He apologized and took it off the bill but I was incredibly disappointed in this restaurant. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone!! Food is terrible and service was nothing special for the prices.   After writing this and then looking at the yelp reviews and photos it looks like the NiÃ§oise salad is not uniform and extremely uneven portions"}
{"text":"I work in the area and was so excited for a new restaurant to open up. My husband and I went in on the 2nd day they were open.  5 stars for the decor. Beautifully done. Gorgeous wood floors, beautiful plants outside, great bar in the middle of the restaurant and I love the open concept. Server didn't know much about the menu, but given they had just opened, we didn't think much of it. I liked the look of their wine list - a lot of variety. Food was decent - I do think $17 for a sandwich is a little pricey. It's a little more upscale than I thought it was going to be (great if that's what they were going for!). Will definitely go back for dinner one night."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere!! Great food & service. Hopefully they expand the happy hour selections to include food. Very happy to have them in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is terrible.  Service is incredibly slow, and menu is overpriced.  Its trying to be a Scottsdale restaurant,  but it doesnt have the chops to be any more than a strip mall type spot.  Avoid."}
{"text":"Great place! The atmosphere is fun and elegant. I had the chorizo burger and it was pretty good, but could have been better. They had good coffee too. The service was great, but could've been better/more personable. I've been here twice now and have not been overly impressed by the quality of their menu."}
{"text":"This is a new favorite! And clearly not just for us -- we had a 5:30 p.m. dinner reservation and expected the place to be empty, but it was (believe it or not) full!   First, a word about the decor: fabulous...as in, I could totally live there. The windows were thrown open, which was wonderful for helping to keep the atmosphere fresh and dissipate the noise (we had a booth on the outside wall, which was perfect).   Service is friendly and welcoming, but a little slow, and our party of four really enjoyed the food. Hubby's bahn mi was fresh with crispy veg and just a touch of spice, my grilled cheese melt was yummy and grease-free (though the tomato \"soup\" was more like a marinara sauce), and our companions loved the chorizo burger. Adult bevvies are pricey, but it's a decent wine list focused on fan favorites and a few interesting choices thrown in.   Yep, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is adorable! I absolutely love it here. The staff is so sweet and they have amazing food. Would recommend this place to everyone I know!!"}
{"text":"I had the Nicoise Salad. It was absolutely fabulous. The greens were the freshest I'd had in a long time in a restaurant. The other ingredients were incredible. HOWEVER, the portion was not very generous for the price. Also, we asked for some bread or crackers but we were told we'd have to purchase the hummus and pita dish to get any bread.   My friend ordered the Chopped Salad. She said it was not anything special and very expensive for it's size as well.   The wait staff were decent. The decor was quite pleasant."}
{"text":"This was really not gluten free. Gluten free means don't eat the pasta or sandwiches. It was difficult to get dairy free because they make things like potatoes ahead and put butter on them, so you can't get potatoes without butter. All dressings for salad including the vinegerette Dressings are creamy meaning they also have dairy. They did hand make a lemon and olive oil vinegerette, but there are places that handle allergies a little better. Was also extremely expensive for their lunch menu."}
{"text":"We went to the soft opening and it was an awesome experience. First, the atmosphere, decor, layout of the bar, aluminum metalwork, open kitchen were just amazing. Very creative design!  The wine room has glass walls and a double wrought iron staircase that is very cool. We went inside, never seen anything like it before.   The restaurant was very busy and for a first night, everything ran smoothly! Drinks were fun (OHSO beers) and the food is incredible. For some reason I did not anticipate such great food. We shared several dishes, half chicken, butcher steak and halibut. Beet and goat cheese salad and a melon salad. I would highly recommend all of them!  They are planning to do coffee in the mornings and light brunch menu, wifi etc so that will definitely be a stop on the way to work, or great to hang out at the garage door windows in the cooler months.   If it's as busy as I think it will be, parking could be a challenge. However, the valet service will make that a non issue.   Great addition to our neighborhood!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time and definitely will not be my last. This was such a great first experience.  When we immediately walked in my friend wouldn't shut up how awesome the place looked. It did look cool! But I said let's wait and see how the service and food goes- we weren't disappointed. The service was great. I love when servers make sure my drink is never empty. The mimosas are big here!  I had the corned beef hash (one of those dishes I'll pretty much always get if someone has it). The server warned me saying it wasn't traditional which I appreciate. I tried it, and it was so good. It was a little smaller portion than expected for the price so next time I'll just ask for some toast or something.  Anyways, I loved this place. My friend did as well. We will definitely be back soon as we go to brunch every week. I'm so happy this place opened. I can't wait to try this place for happy hour or their dinner menu!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is great. The food is excellent, but I gave this restaurant a 3 star review because half of my family are vegetarians and the menu is sorely lacking vegetarian options. We would love to see more alternatives."}
{"text":"The food hear was fabulous!  The highlight was by far the braised beef ravioli.  The pasta was cooked perfectly, and the short rib meat inside was unbelievable.  Best ravioli I have ever had.  We also had the cheddar mac with sausage and shrimp.  It was also fantastic.   Great place for a date night.    Our waiter was not the best in the business; he was slow and inattentive.  The beer selection was terrible, but the wine and scotch selection was great.  They also do not carry Belvidere vodka, and a restaurant of this caliber should."}
{"text":"The neighborhood needed something like this. This review is a bit delayed as a lot has been going on but I'm finally getting around to it.   We went on a Tuesday night around 8:00 p.m. so there were no issues with parking. During the weekend, I'm sure valet will be necessary as we have driven past this place and noticed that it gets packed.   I didn't think the menu was all that creative but the food was still good. I went with the pan seared scallops dish, my fiancÃ© decided on the short rib dip and my future BIL went with the butcher's steak. I thought the scallops were quite tasty and the polenta cake that came with it was a nice pairing. I was also a fan of the carrots on my plate - nicely plated as you can see in my photo.   My fiancÃ© did not care for his sandwich. He wished he had ordered something else. His brother thought his plate was a decent steak but nothing spectacular.   The bartender that was taking care of us was very nice and helpful as well. She actually recommended the scallops and I'm glad she did.   Not sure if it is a place we will frequent but we will visit once in a while since it is nearby and we had a good first impression."}
{"text":"Oh boy!  I was a little nervous to go here for the first time because I saw the reviews were a bit \"iffy\", but the restaurant is practically brand new and everyone has growing pains and adjustments to make in the few months of opening... but, with that being said....  I loved this place and cannot wait to go back!!  Dinner for 4 on a Monday night... the parking was empty, but I valet'ed anyway...  I always wear an imaginary tiara!    The decor was charming, glittery, and fabulous!  So much fun!   The service was so friendly!    Our table ordered the hummus plate - fantastic.  I had the short rib ravioli and it was delicious!!  My friends had the scallops, the melon/feta salad with steak, and the chicken... and everyone was extremely pleased!    Like I said, I cannot wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"So excited that The Covenant is in our neighborhood!  Happy Hour from 3-6 Monday-Friday.  $5 draft Arizona beers, there are 5 $7 glasses of wine Chardonnay,  Sauvignon Blanc, RosÃ©, Pinot Noir and Red Blend, and a couple of cocktails.   Brunch Saturday and Sunday at 9 a.m.  The barista section opens at 7 a.m. starting September 25th with pastries and plenty of plug-ins for laptops."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. It's easy for a trendy place to rely solely on ambience and falter on the important stuff (food and service), but The Covenant does an amazing job in all aspects. We've always sat at the bar, and every bartender we've had here as been extremely knowledgeable and friendly.   Get the charred octopus appetizer. And oh my god, anything with their short rib. I literally day dream about their short rib dip- it's the best sandwich I've ordered from anywhere in recent memory. Their wine selection is amazing, and their house cocktails are very good as well."}
{"text":"Finally, a wonderful spot in Paradise Valley to visit often; and bring friends to. Every. Single. Thing.  Perfect.  Amazing drink suggestions and paired to my food choices by Brandon. (He was spot-on with every one).  Such a refreshing place where the people that serve you are as happy as their guests.  Even if I move away from the area I will absolutely come back to the Covenant every chance I get. It's THAT great.  Thank you, and very well done in every way.  Tomahawk Steak was the best steak I've had anywhere."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and enjoyed dinner with my husband. All the food was good, nice service - I loved the crossanti(?) dessert I had! We had two drinks each, a shared app, entree each and dessert each and ended up at ~$150, not too bad. All around a solid experience."}
{"text":"Food was just okay.  the short rib dip was cold. The side salad was what you would get on the tray of food you get on a plane. My Moscow mule was flat. I pretty much won't be returning. Bummer, it's close to home."}
{"text":"Excellent food...but when your waiter doesn't check on the meal to se if it's too our liking, and when we have to get the hostess to get us water, and when coffee is served cold I call that 3 strikes.  Will likely not be back...a shame, it's a beautiful place!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I have a consistently great experience here every time I come in. The atmosphere is so fun with the perfect amount of class. Love the chairs, I need them for my house. The bar tenders and servers have never rushed me out at the end of the night. They are always so pleasant and fun to chat with. They have been great accommodating large groups and small groups the same. I love showing this place off to people. The chorizo burger is delicious and has so much flavor! The charred octopus is my absolute favorite. The ceviche is also a solid choice. I've tried the tuna Banh mi and the prime rib dip also, both delicious and flavorful. He house salad is always fresh and has nice variety. The NiÃ§oise salad is another good option with tuna. The drinks are great here also! They have quite the variety of unique cocktails. Their coffee is also worth checking out. They have a lavender syrup that is a surprisingly good addition to their mochas. Our bartender today was Sara and she was so great! She gave great advice and insight on food options. She was attentive to our needs!"}
{"text":"We came here for Mother's Day brunch and the food was amazing, the drinks were delicious and the service was great. Everyone was so friendly and the atmosphere is welcoming and elegant. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing place with great drinks and very amazing food!  Love the decor!  Get there when they open for brunch as they get busy very quickly!  Love the bottomless mimosas!"}
{"text":"We were there opening week.  Had a 5 pm res and were pleased with the complimentary valet parking.  The banquette seating was so close we felt we had to converse with the neighboring tables and whisper if we wanted to discuss anything personal.  Wait!  Couldn't whisper because the noise level was so loud we could barely hear each other with inside voices.  It was also so hot that sweat was running down our face and neck.  Maybe the sweat was what attracted the flys.  Very limited and expensive wine by the glass selection.  I had the scallops and was surprised at the generous portion (5).  They were accompanied with roasted carrots (4), brussel sprout (1/2), and 1 broccoli flowerette. The scallops were served with a light sauce which served as a little swimming pool for the polenta, which was soggy. The price wasn't bad @$29 but the quality was mediocre at best.  At 6 pm we were out the door, so one hour of just ok dining at $60. plus for one including just 1 glass of wine and tips, earned this my 2 star review."}
{"text":"First time here and it was wonderful.  The short rib dish was so delicious. Expected a little more amazingness from the chopped salad, but it was still pretty good. The decor is beautiful and classy, suiting the ambiance very well. Definitely will return - great spot!"}
{"text":"First thing I would say is definitely make a reservation if you plan to go here for dinner on a Saturday night. We got there at 7, we're told it would be a 45 min wait.....and then waited over an hour. We almost left. But, redeeming qualities: the manager comped some appetizers (and would have for drinks too but we were not drinking that night); the server was really friendly; the food was really good. So was it worth the wait? Eh. I would be willing to try it again for brunch."}
{"text":"A couple of my girlfriends and I that live nearby thought we would try... It was really crowded as we expected for a newer place, however we were met by a pretentious manager, that acted as if we were asking a ridiculous question of him, when we asked if seats were open in the back part of restaurant. He actually commented, quite surly..\"what did you expect, you'll need to show up earlier if you want a seat!\" I guess it was the way it was said. We left and went to Rusconi's across the street."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the SECOND time and yet again extremely rude service and terrible customer service. We decided last minute to go check it out for happy hour and the first thing they first thing they asked was \"do you have a reservation?\" And there were multiple tables open and then they told me I could only sit for 1 hr since they had reservations. We finally were able to sit and the happy hour menu was very disappointing with hardly any options. This place is just too uppity for me and is NOT the \"friendly neighborhood\" place I was hoping it would be! The decor is great and very fancy just not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"This place is about 5 months new and is owned by the same couple that owns O.H.S.O. Brewery. But it's much more upscale. The drink menu is full of local beers, there's a wine room that goes up to the ceiling, and the cocktails are varied and delicious. Now as for the food, the emphasis on local and fresh ingredients makes such a difference. You can tell the chefs put a lot of heart into the menu and you can taste the difference. I had the fresh fish of the day which was mahi-mahi and tried my girlfriends braised beef ravioli. They were both amazing. The goat cheese bruschetta appetizer was equally impressive. I figured we'd be boxing some leftovers but we couldn't help but eat every bit. Oops. It's a pricier upscale place, but it's well worth it and great for a special occasion or date night!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour last Saturday evening, and what a great place! The appetizers were amazing.  We ordered the Shrimp Poke, as well as the Crab cakes. Loved them both. The drinks were wonderful as well.  What a fun atmosphere! Enjoyed sitting up at the bar. As the night went on, it was very busy. People were friendly, buying drinks for the crowd.  What a great time we had for my first time there. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Our waiter recommended the Poke Tuna appetizer with crispy wonton crackers, wakame, daikon, toasted sesame, avocado,edamame, tobiko and spicy aioli.  My sister said it was spicy and very good! She had the pan seared scallops which were amazing and I had the half roasted chicken since I'm living on Whole30.  Amir recommended the \"Lincoln Drive\" cocktail which my sister really liked. Great atmosphere excellent food so if you feel like splurging on lunch just do it!"}
{"text":"Great dinner this week! Started with the poke appetizer which was phenomenal. The one with the chips was a great presentation and tasted even better. Had an opportunity to enjoy both the steak and scallops as my wife and I shared. Scallops were delicious with the polenta and the steak melted in your mouth. The after dinner coffees were so good I want to head back this week for one on the way to work. It definitely does not hurt that this place is within walking distance to the house. Looking forward to getting back for a chance to partake in happy hour."}
{"text":"Beautiful spot on the corner of Tatum and Shea. Atmosphere is classy but casual, garage door style windows are a nice touch.  For appetizers we had the crab cake and charcuterie board both were excellent.  The short rib ravioli, scallops, and banh mi sandwich were a favorite of everyone. Good cocktail and wine list, the girls loved the Carri and Big guy cocktail.  I would definitely recommend this to friends. Looking forward to the coffee bar opening up soon. It will be a nice spot for morning meetings."}
{"text":"Excellent food and presentation, swanky atmosphere and great staff and service!!  Would definitely recommend and can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"The most amazing place with the best atmosphere ever. The service is excellent and the food is out of this world. Marie our waitress was beautiful. Her smile and service impeccable. She was a true joy.  My experience was wonderful. I will return."}
{"text":"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy... and that goes for hard working girls, too. I mean you GOTTA mix some play into the day, so my girls and I headed over to The Covenant for lunch/early happy hour.   First impressions: Wow! Just wow. Absolutely LOVE the decor, the wine selection, and the fact that the windows open up so you get the outside breeze. We sat at a high top along with wall with the perfect breeze from outside. Our amazing server (I think it was Katie?) came over and got our drink order (RosÃ¨ all day!), and recommended some appetizers, including the hummus board. We were sold on the hummus board, and when it was brought out, it was pretty much the most gorgeous and colorful hummus board I've ever seen in my life! (See photo).   For lunch, we each ordered different items so we could share/taste a variety of items since this was our first time here. I ordered the Grilled Cheese Melt -- and need I say more? It was ooey, gooey, melty cheddar cheese with tomatoes and bacon on sourdough, served with pesto tomato soup on the side. Perfection at its best!  One of my friends ordered The Farm salad, which, let me tell you -- this salad makes you excited to eat healthy. It was so colorful and beautiful, it looked like a bowl full of colorful confetti over a bed of baby field greens... and the charred lemon vinaigrette was phenomenal. My other friend ordered the Braised Beef Ravioli, so rich with flavor, yet cooked to perfection that it literally melted in my mouth.   Since this was our first time dining here, our wonderful server brought us out an apple crisp dessert... and although we were super full, we still ate it 'cause you know dessert doesn't go to the stomach, it goes to the heart.   Overall we had a great experience at The Covenant, and I'm excited to go back and try other menu items, as well as the Coffee Bar items!"}
{"text":"Went here for a date night, which me and my boyfriend don't get too often because of our hectic schedule, and we loved everything! We are both in the industry and everything from the food to the service to the management was amazing. We had a reservation at 5, sat right away, it was slow at first but then it picked up. We had some happy hour apps (brussel sprouts and clams) and omg they were amazing! We each had 2 cocktails, a glass of wine, and a coffee cocktail...its date night, it's allowed! :) but a really nice craft cocktail list and wine selection. The butcher steak was lack luster but honestly everything else was so good that it didn't matter. Shout out to the manager Aji. Asked us how we were numerous times and gave us dessert on the house for our date night. She's awesome!!"}
{"text":"Nice place to chill... great food, open late, open early, extensive bar.. nice atmosphere.. 30 somethings"}
{"text":"OMG! What an amazing place! Gabby is absolutely fantastic. World class service...Thank you!"}
{"text":"We recently celebrated one of our friends birthdays there and it is beautiful! The bottomless mimosas are a great way to start your Sunday. The civiche and ahi Tuna appetizers were so good! Great service, very accommodating, and great wine list as well!"}
{"text":"Big quiet hotel with large suites and nice staff. Fist thing you notice is lack of upgrade: old tube TVs, old telephones and sticky floors. There is a strong smell in the rooms that you never get used to."}
{"text":"What a nice find, this is a bright and inviting place with fun decor. I went here with some ladies for Sunday brunch and was so pleased with such great service and nice atmosphere. I had the avocado toast and mimosas finished off with a huge latte and everything was delicious. My friends were all happy with their food as well. One friend mentioned she would have like more salmon on her Salmon plate, but other than that all was delicious. The Parking was a little tight and I could see this being a problem at popular times. We were surprised that it was super quiet for Sunday brunch and we will visit again"}
{"text":"My wife and I have had dinner at The Covenant twice. Both times the dinners and service was outstanding. It's worth the cost which can be expensive but for a special night it is certainly worth it."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is sooooooo beautiful! Great menu with quite a variety, a little pricey, great craft cocktails. I had the chorizo Chile relleno with an over easy egg, very delicious. They have a farmers market cocktail that's made with a green Chile vodka - very unique."}
{"text":"What a great new spot in Phoenix! The inside decor is modern, cozy and inviting. The wait staff was incredibly kind and knowledgeable. My favorite meal on the menu was the chili rellano. Be sure to check out this new hotspot!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try The Covenant as I drive by it all the time. Headed there tonight for a girls night out. The ambiance is good, service was good but my food was not. I asked the waitress for a recommendation as I was torn between a few options. I thought I wanted the Banh mi sandwich, but she said that the soft fish on the hard baguette was off-putting to some patrons but that she had never tried it (strange that she would say that to me). I asked her about salads and she pointed out the NiÃ§oise salad - it is listed in red type on the menu (house speciality) and said it was 'amazing'. So I ordered it. Amazing it was not. Zero flavor.  I mean, zero. Just a bowl of mixed greens with bland veggies. It supposedly had a vinaigrette on it but I couldn't taste anything. Really disappointed in something that was supposed to be amazing.   My friends and I did share the hummus board, which was ok. But it's hummus - it's hard to mess that up. I ordered a Moscow mule too, which was just average.  The food/bev was not inexpensive either - the quality & flavor is going to have to go up if they want to stay in business.   I am not a food snob, it doesn't take a lot to make me happy but I think I'll spend my money elsewhere rather than go back."}
{"text":"I had a business dinner at the Covenant a few weeks ago and was so excited to check out this new place!  First off, it is beautifully decorated and has an open and airy feel to it.  The service was great and food was quite tasty too.  I had a glass of Sancerre with my meal and really enjoyed it.  We shared the hummus with roasted veggies to start and I enjoyed the scallops for my entree (too much food, but quite delicious).  Definitely a great addition to the Phoenix dining scene!"}
{"text":"We have had lunch here a couple of times and decided to take another couple with us for dinner last night. We were seated by the kitchen, had an excellent friendly and fun server who told us she loves working there, because of the owner and managers. We all completely enjoyed our meal and experience. The beet goat cheese salad was amazing, as well as the Poke appetizer which was my main course, a fabulous presentation! Others in our party had the roasted Chicken, Scallops and Relleno's. It was fun to see all the wonderfully presented food coming out, talking to and watching the Chef. Highly recommend this establishment!"}
{"text":"This place is very cool inside. Awesome decor. Food was good. Wine is pricey and everyone seems very nice"}
{"text":"My wife and I are purchasing a house in the neighborhood and were concerned about what local eateries and umm, drinkeries (?), there were close by.  We drove 'round the neighborhood and found The Covenant and wow, are we stoked.  Everything we ate and drank was awesome and everyone was so friendly and informative about the area.  We can't eat to live close by and make this our go-to place!"}
{"text":"Not so sure about this place  We got there at 8:15 pm a group of 6 ppl  One of our friends came with a plastic cup ( with Alcohol) I know it's not ok but he came from a different place and forgot , the manger came rude to him like he is 4 yrs old and start bitching at him ( he is a doctor btw )  After that we got a lady nice server , she was AWSOME funny and fast we order food .  Wow the food DONT ORDER FOOD . Everything was over cooked ( maybe bc it was Monday and the have 3 team chef there ) the prices are crazy and to portions are small We stay there 2 hrs and the atmosphere was nice bc of the group of friends .  The drinks where bad too  I order vodka soda twice and got vodka water  So there are many place to go just not my place I guess"}
{"text":"Wow, pretty disappointed. We got three salads to go. I had The Farm with chicken. There were a few roasted vegetables (under 15) on a big bed of greens. They were roasted well but without much flavor. The dressing was excellent. The chicken was flavorful but the skin fat had not been removed and it was overpowering. The fatty flavor was gross.   My friends had similar reactions. For the $$$ pricing, this salad has a long way to go."}
{"text":"Amazing food,  awesome service! Bottomless champagne mimosas were good and never stopped coming.  I'll be a return customer."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to the covenant. I will say I have enjoyed the 4 dishes I have tasted, my favorite being the tomato soup with grilled cheese. Yum. We went there tonight for a celebratory dinner for my boyfriends first day at his new job. They told us it was going to be 30 min but then two bar seats opened so, yay. Tonight we ordered the melon and feta salad and the slices were like fucking steaks of melons, no easy eating! My first bite had a sticker from one of the melons in it. It wasn't  a huge deal not a finger or something but, I don't want to eat that. Smaller pieces of melons would have been nice but all and all delish. Then we ordered the braised short ribs and received the prime dip, (which looked delicious also but not what we ordered). When the right dish came is was so yummy. We ate it all and the bartender comped us a desert and a glass of wine. Good enough for me! We will be back for brunch now that they have $15 bottomless mimosas!"}
{"text":"This restaurant came highly recommended from friends and oh it was worth the hype.   One of our most fun nights out all year.    We sat in a super comfortable booth that had a huge open window so it felt like dining outside while being in the comfort of this glitzy restaurant.  We started with a bottle of wine and got a little crazy as we ordered the Poke appetizer but also the Chefs MAC and Cheese.  It is typically an entree but we decided to share for an app.  It was tasty.  Cooked perfect!    After that we decided to share 3 meals for 4 people. The very best was the ribeye. This steak melted in your mouth.  And it was perfect to share so everyone could have a taste.    We ended with coffee drinks that were just out of this world and a great dessert.   The waiter was attentive but not too much and the Manager came over to insure we were having a great experience.     A super place for a date nite or going out with friends.   Don't plan to eat and run.  You have to enjoy the adventure!   Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Honestly... way over-priced with trendy food that will leave you wanting to go get something to eat.  People are nice and decor is yuppie nice but just the kind of place for snooty types.  Wasn't for me.... at all.  $30 for a small appetizer and one drink... really?"}
{"text":"We made a reservation for four. The restaurant was vertically empty of patrons when we arrived.   We were seated at a table and given menus. We asked for the volume of the music to be lowered since it was so loud we could not hear our table mates.   We ordered the hummus appetizer which was interesting and tasty.  We asked the server about the daily fish special and although he knew what it was, he had no description of it. Was it a steak? Filet? Dense? Flakey? Sweet? Strong tasting? Preparation?  We had to ask to have the hummus cleaned from the table top since it had flowed over the edge of the serving board.  We also had to ask for the appetizer plates to be removed when we were finished with them.   A requested medium rare burger was presented very well done. When a replacement burger was brought, it was still overdone.   We repeatedly had to ask to have our water replenished and often our server was no where to be found.   When we asked for our check it took almost fifteen minutes for our server to bring it to us.   The service was very, very poor, the food fair. This restaurant needs a manager to oversee and coordinate service and food!   We will not be frequenting Covenant again."}
{"text":"Short Story - NEWLY OPENED Gorgeous Glamorous New American Style Restaurant that may be still finding their stride. On my visit one out of three dishes was delicious and technically great! Another dish was ok....and one dish wasn't ready to be on the menu yet. Our server was attentive and the manager made light conversation and was open to criticism.  Longer story -   The Covenant is located in the corner of the Whole Foods Shopping Center and has free valet parking. Inside is very glamorous with chandeliers and artsy mirrors. They have a Charlie Palmer Style Wine Tower in the room and also an open rack of whiskeys on display to wet your whistle. The kitchen is open so you can view the action or the 900 degree wood oven. There are a small amount booths but most of the seating are high top deuce banquets or at the large bar. On my visit the atmosphere was energetic, a bit loud and the air was on the humid side.  We started out by sharing a Melon Feta Salad. The salad was very generous in size. They graciously split the salad in two large bowls. We received a variety of melon, tangy feta, peppery arugula, a little creamy avocado that was dusted with Korean Red Pepper Threads. The salad was more like a fruit cup because it lacked dressing of any kind. I did speak to the manager about this dish and he agreed with me and informed me that the kitchen is coming up with a dressing for this dish that sounds delicious so maybe by tomorrow this dish could be wonderful.  For dinner I wanted to order the fish of the day but I was informed it was already sold out before dinner..............  I went with my second choice and picked the chicken dinner. I received a STUNNING CHICKEN DINNER. Super moist flavorful thigh and breast with GORGEOUS Extra Fancy vegetables they smashed creamy fingerling potatoes and crisped them up. It was a great big serving too....They did a chicken dinner really well.  My husband had what they called the Chef's Cheddar Mac. It was pretty good but my husband wished that the dish had more of the really tasty andouille sausage and he also wished the shrimp weren't over cooked.  I think things will improve rapidly since the manager has an open ear to the customers.  This is a very nice gorgeous restaurant but since it's newly opened it could be a little hit and miss for now.  Great Potential!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were so excited to try this place. We don't have super hip restaurants in this area so we eagerly awaited their opening and gave them about a month to really settle in before we went. The decor is beautiful and hip. The food, unfortunately,  just didn't live up to the rest. We started with the Ahi Poke appetizer and shared one of the chopped salads. The Ahi was good...just a little lack luster for the price and the chopped salad was pretty bland. My husband had the Fire Braised Short Rib and I opted for the Braised Beef Ravioli. His dinner was pretty tasty. I think I ate more of his than my own. The ravioli was so disappointing. I've never had ravioli that I needed to cut with a knife before. It was just dried out and chewy. I ate two of them and then just gave up. I was hoping the manager would be walking around. I'm happy to give my feedback, especially for a new restaurant. That never happened and the waitress didn't seem to care that I barely touched my food. Overall it was just OK. There are many really good restaurants, especially at this price point, that just get it right. SHOOT...there are many below this price point that I would prefer to go to. At the end of the day we will try them again, in maybe 6 months or so. Hopefully they will take the feedback offered to them and make some adjustments."}
{"text":"So although I'm leaving 1 star, I feel I am leaving a complete and honest review.  So first, the atmosphere was great. Very modern and nice. We had reservations so no wait.  Then came the bad. It took about 10 minutes before a waitress came to give us water but she wasn't even our waitress. Another 5 minutes passed before they came over. Ordered drinks which took a while. Then ordered food which took over 40 minutes. They cut our bill in half for the wait, but still it just wasn't a pleasant experience. And our waitress had zero personality. The food was maybe a 6 out of 10. Sooo overall while the place was nice; the service and food were not spectacular, especially for the price. Probably will not go back; but guess it was worth a try."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time and money here. Waited for over and hr for my food and Findlay had to walkout. If you can't get the food prep and serve on Monday night, maybe you should close it down and start a hotdog stand for start Bc you're wasting peoples time."}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere! The Butcher's Steak was one of the best dishes I have had. Just be sure to make a reservation beforehand! :)"}
{"text":"Such a cool atmosphere. Very fresh and new. My friend and I came here for lunch. The music was classic 80's. Love. We enjoyed the Ahi appetizer. Short ribs were also a great choice. I had the ravioli 's!!! Yum! Ester was a fabulous waitress. She handled our requests and questions with ease. We will definitely be back to feel out their night life vibe."}
{"text":"Terrible place. Nothing good to say, and we eat out all the time and are easy going. Beautiful atmosphere and wine room but the wine came out bad. Service was terrible and waited so long for water glasses to be filled, actually had to go to the bar for water refills. I had the chicken, guest had the fish. Both were dryers out. Like they had been precooked and under a heat lamp. And to end the night, the bill was $200.00. They better work on their service and quality soon or we will looking at another Scottsdale Resturant available for rent."}
{"text":"We selected another restaurant for dinner across the street, but turns out they had a 2 hour wait, so asking for what else was good in the area, they directed us across the street to The Covenant...and what a great recommendation. This is high quality dining.  Eight in our dinner party, and the reviews were \"phenomenal\" from everyone.  Among the standout selections we had: tomato soup (fantastic), salmon (excellent), mac and cheese dish (well done), and the favorite at the table, tried by a few folks was the beef ravioli.  We had a few of the deserts, with the apple berry item getting the most nods of appreciation.  Very good whisky selection - I had High West Campfire - oh so nice - desert in a glass. Service was stellar with a capital S.   Bravo - The Covenant!!!"}
{"text":"First off, I like the decor and the layout...but that is about it.  I don't mind a noisy restaurant but I would like to be able to chat and not have to lean in to hear.  We sat at the bar and even the waitress had a hard time hearing our order...I am a deep bass voice guy that normally  gets told by my wife to talk softer.  The food was blah.  I asked about the corn beef hash and was told that it is outstanding.  So if you call rubbery chunks of corn beef with fried eggs on top when the menu calls for poached, then this is your place.  The wife and granddaughter's dish were mediocre at best.  Too bad as we live in the neighborhood and this would be an ideal location for us to patronize on a normal basis but no mas."}
{"text":"A huge win for the NW corner of Tatum and Shea.  I was able to enjoy this restaurant during their soft opening and it's a Wow! Awesome decor, food, drink and service. They put a lot of effort (and $!) into creating a great space from the bar to the kitchen to the wine racks.  They've got some nice house cocktails to get you started and a good variety on the menu, from goat cheese bruschetta and ahi poke on the appetizers, to a tomahawk steak and nice looking salads.  I'm looking forward to coming back many more times."}
{"text":"Nope.  No thank you.......   Ambiance: The restaurant itself it cool - modern feel, groovy lighting, and located in a pocket of town that seriously needs an upscale place.  Service: Mediocre (at best).  Not impressed when I ask the waiter to recommend his favorite dish...and he immediately responds \"the Tomahawk Steak.\"  Uhm...you mean the $89 Tomahawk Steak?  I'm good.  Food: Nothing on the menu looked particularly interesting.  Went with the Butcher's Steak. MEH....  Pretty tough and flavorless, plopped on top of some barely-identifiable, mushy veggies.  The potatoes, again - soft and lacking in flavor.  The tomato jam/sauce was one dimensional in flavor - sweet. Come one guys...add some heat or salt to the flavor profile.  For the same price, I could have had the super-yummy Hawaiian Ribeye from Hillstone...always a great steak, great flavor, cooked exactly as requested. Yum!  This place seems to have an identity crisis.  It feels as if an attempt to replicate Houstons/Hillstone/Grassroots....but falls short.  The Yelp reviews are pretty all-over-the-place.  Seems like this might be an okay spot for Happy Hour - for dinner, I'd pass.  Cheers!  POSTSCRIPT: My dog would like to report that she found the leftover steak to be quite delicious and succulent. Four paws up!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place for brunch and bring a group of gals to try the experience with me. I've been here for happy hour before and sat at the bar and it was pretty good so thought it would be nice to try a meal at some point too. So we made a reservation for today, were seated in one of the large booths towards the back of the dining area close to the restrooms. I didn't think anything of the location of the table at the time, but towards the end of our experience realized that it can't be easy to check on the tables back there without actually walking over there. Which no matter what, the server should be keeping a good eye on the tables he or she is taking care of.   That said we took our time ordering our food. We ordered Lavender Mochas which came out first and were very delicious. It then took a while for the server to come back for our food order which finally we were like hmmm is this person ever coming back? The place was pretty busy, but not overloaded to where they couldn't handle quality service. We'd been there over an hour at this point which wasn't too bad as we were all busy chatting. Anyways we finally order. I got the chicken sandwich. Another 45+ minutes goes by where finally we're like hmmm what happened to our food? Finally it comes and one of the managers expressed a brief apology about a back up and mishap in the kitchen. Okay, no big deal since we have our food now. Well sadly the bottom bun on my sandwich was soggy so it must have been sitting for a bit of time in the kitchen area to become that soggy. Too hungry at this point to say anything or send it back, I just dealt with it.   Once we finished we didn't see our server until she swiftly comes by asking if we need any boxes. Took a while to finally get the one box we asked for, but the server disappears for a long period of time once again. Finally we had to wave down someone, anyone to get our server to close us out. What we hoped would be a casual Sunday lunch catching up with some girlfriends ended up being a bit of a let down in terms of the restaurant experience and service. I want this place to succeed, but I think there is some lack of attentiveness with some of the staff - or something, but I probably won't be going back here anytime soon. I'm not even in the neighborhood and made a trip from downtown Phoenix to try it out.   Hopefully some significant changes can be made because I'm impressed with the ratings on Yelp for this place! Hopefully something was just off and we had bad timing in coming in today. We didn't even have mimosas or cocktails either!!!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I finally got to try this place out! The decor inside is just beautiful! Lots of tiffany blues with crystal chandeliers and mirrors. Reminds me of some places in Houston. You just don't see many places as gorgeous as this.  They also have high end liquors.   The food did not disappoint either. Four starters, were had the goat cheese bruchetta...  which was topped with pistachios, this, and a beet reduction. Highly recommend.  I ordered the fish of the day which was halibut that was cooked to perfection- a nice crisp and flakey paired with polenta. My husband ordered the short rib that was atop risotto. Both were AMAZING!!!  I seriously can't wait to go back.  I noticed the brunch menu and happy hour... I still need to return for these!"}
{"text":"Nice people and atmosphere. The food absolutely is horrible. My wife and her friend had the best Salad with chicken that was so drying was like chicken jerk. I had the Chili Reano that was so bad I had no idea what it was. No happy hour the cheese and meat board were lame. No thanks"}
{"text":"My wife and I loved our experience at your restaurant, the food was great our server Aamir was off the hook incredible, we had the time of our life go here as often as you can and try everything."}
{"text":"Went with a work group for late afternoon lunch. Great ambiance and bar. Excellent drinks  Good food Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful place that was tastefully done. They put a lot into the decor. However they also should have put some time and effort into the food they serve. Ho hum menu with all the basics just doesn't cut it. The Salmon, Roast Chicken are so average and boring without much flavor. The same roasted vegetable with every entree. No bread served with entrees either.  Service is ok but not up to par. Servers seemed inexperienced. This place is like a whole lot of others. Mediocre. It just not worth a return trip. It seems like they all care about their Cocktails programs and not the food!!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Fiona Apple - Criminal)   I've been a fat fat boy I've been hungry for a delectable meal And its a bad ass world When a man will sing a song just because he Yelps  Don't you tell me to deny it I've done drank and I want to suffer for my sins I've come to you cause I need whiskey to be true And I just don't know where I can begin  What I need is a good menu So I'm feelin' for The Covenant And I need to be refreshed To the place I've Yelped with friends Because it's all I ever knew of food   The Covenant is a beautiful restaurant located in the busy heart of Paradise Valley.    The restaurant definitely has a classy allure with a casual ambiance.  They serve up some modern American meals with a hint of some cultural punch like the Banh Mi, Poke Bowls, and Chile Rellanos.  Their drink selections are fun and extensive so take your time.  I'm a whiskey guy and the manager was willing to offer his suggestions and boy did he hit the spot for me!  I love it spicy and he did me well.    Moving on to the food since this is a food review, we started out with some brussel sprouts and steam clams.  The brussel sprouts were slightly roasted and came along with some andouille sausage.  Our steam clams came on a sweet and savory white wine tomato sauce.  It was so good I asked for another round of flatbread to soak up the sauce!  Sweet and full of chunks of tomato; it was savory with every bite!   For my entree, I shot for the Fire Braised Short Ribs while my friend got their barramundi.  She said it was well cooked and had a nice crispy skin.  My short ribs were on fire; but not what you think.  It's not spicy by any means, but man it was tender to the point where I didn't need a knife to cut through it.  The farro risotto added a sweet creamy texture along with the vegetables which was cooked to perfection; not raw, but still had a fresh crisp crunch.     Overall, our service was phenomenal and attentive.  The ambiance is fresh and cool; definitely need to come back for just drinks and HH.  Finally, the food was popping especially to my palates!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Dinner was great! Good variety of Rose' wine to choose from. Cocktails looked yummy too! We had the ceviche, melon salad & poke for an appetizer. All were tasty. The ceviche & melon salad could've used a bit more spice but that's a personal preference. For dinner we shared the short rib ravioli & relleno. The ravioli was delish. The relleno was highly recommended but not my favorite. The filling was good but the pepper was undercooked. The service was good (plenty of check-ins, multiple servers) but it needs some fine tuning (plates not cleared in a timely manner, wine not refilled). Overall a great experience and I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Very good lunch, excellent service, nice ambiance.  I booked a table on Yelp and came here for lunch the other day and I am already thinking when can I come back again here?  Our table started with hummus board. Healthy option for appetizer and I loved it.  I had scallops for lunch and scallops were cooked to perfection, side dishes were tasty too.  Server was attentive, he was friendly and efficient.  Most of all, I liked the way they decorated this place. I was here for lunch but this place made me want to come back for dinner. I think this place will be good for first date. Not that intimate but open enough to feel comfortable. Looking at all those alcohol, good place to come for a drink."}
{"text":"To preface this review, we eat out often......very often and was waiting for The Covenant to have sometime to get it up and rolling before we had our visit.  We had two join us for dinner, cocktails and dessert. If you like bling and great service, this is the place; however, if it's food you're wanting, go elsewhere. Had the octopus appetizer that was cooked fine, but without flavor.  We also had the scallops and \"chorizo chili relleno\". Notice the relleno is in quotes due it falling short of one.  I am undoubtedly a relleno connoisseur.  At best I would label it as a stuffed pepper loaded with potatoes and sprinkled with some chorizo.  Heavy on potatoes, light on the chorizo and lighter yet on flavor. Very disappointed with the lack of flavor and overstuffed with potatoes.  The corn sauce the chili sat in may have better been enhanced with bits of roasted corn kernels throughout. Scallops, cooked to perfection, but again lack of flavor in its sauce.  The roasted vegetables save the dish from total disaster.  Don't think you can mess up roasting veggies. Friends had a salad and sandwich, which they were less than thrilled.  I was told the salad was just that, a plain ordinary salad and the chicken sandwich had great flavor.To prefe  Overall, great smiling service and attentive, hence 3 stars, and of course a comfortable atmosphere.  If they can only ramp up the food to wow you at their prime pricing, this place may do well."}
{"text":"This new restaurant is on the corner of Tatum and Shea.  Parking can be scarce but they do offer valet.  The interior is decorated beautifully.  Their menu offers a lot of hearty choices.  We went with the grilled octopus and the large Tomahawk rib eye steak.  Both were very tasty although the steak was slightly over cooked for the way we ordered it done.  They did offer to cook us another one but who wants to wait while the rest of the dinner party is already eating?  They also have some sort of partnership with OHSO and I really liked my Boom Dynamite IPA."}
{"text":"Awesome craft drink bar. And coffee bar. Awesome wine choices. Awesome restaurant. Cool decor. Reminded me inside of The Henry. Staff great. Cooks amazing. Chorizo Burger was da bomb. Salad Nicoles yum too.  Going back for coffee bar next time. OHSO draft beers. Soooooo good. Tatum & Shea. 2 months since it's been opened. Run don't walk...."}
{"text":"This place is super cool. Great food and drink menu. We've been a few times. No complaints."}
{"text":"Wanted to love it., but ended up being underwhelmed by the food AND service. Went on a Sunday afternoon at 1pm.  It was moderately busy but not slammed. Plenty of open tables.    Son had the grilled cheese and soup which was tasty.  I ordered the chicken sandwich.  It had absolutely no flavor.  The bread was good and I was starving so I ate half of it and gave the other half to my teenage son...who took just one bite.   Now, they are new and I can overlook that IF the server or anyone for that matter acted liked they gave a sh$t. I told our server what I thought of the sandwich and he did offer to get me something else....but we had already waited a lonnnng time for one coke and for our food to come, so I passed.  Either he didn't pass my comments on or management doesn't care about their customers experience...not sure which.  Along with that, waters were never refilled and by the time our server checked in after delivering food, the son was finished and I had eaten half my sandwich.   Waited another several minutes for the check. While waiting, I looked at the wine list.  YIKES!!  super steep prices!!   Not sure we will try again or just wait it out at OHSO. :o/"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant, fantastic service and delicious food!!!  The drinks are yummy and the tomato soup is splendid."}
{"text":"This place was so good and soo pretty inside. I just want to live in this restaurant and that wine cellar. I got the tomahawk steak and it was amazing!!!   Scallops were great and so was the beet salad! I recommend all three!"}
{"text":"Beautiful new restaurant!  We stopped in early dinner for a quick bite.  I was taken back by the inside decore.  We sat at high top tables and ordered a few items to share. Planning to go back for a girls night out!"}
{"text":"I just returned home from another visit to The Covenant... this time it was for a Mother's Day ladies brunch and it was great.  I made a 10:45 reservation via Yelp for four people (me, my mother-in-law, my grandmother-in-law, and my daughter).  I wasn't sure how it would work out for my 5 year old, as I didn't know if The Covenant offered a kids menu, but they did, and it worked out just fine.  This time my party was seated in Gabby's section, and she was fabulous.  My daughter did the kids pasta and fruit and the adults shared a hummus board, avocado toast, and a frittata.  It was more than enough food.    The special chocolate covered strawberries for the mothers at the end of the meal were a very nice (and delicious surprise).  Thanks so much and Happy Mother's Day to those reading this today ;)"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Amazing service, drinks & food! And great atmosphere. Will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a super delicious dinner at Covenant. We didn't have a reservation so it was great when we walked right up a were seated at the community table. I started with a vodka cocktail, the farmers market. So refreshing and citrusy but not too sweet - delish. Three of us shared the octopus appetizer which was fantastic. The octopus had a nice char with good seasoning and was wading in a tomato broth goodness that also had chorizo and fingerling potatoes. Such good flavors! We did family style sharing on entrees. Chopped salad, Mac and cheese, and tomahawk steak. The chopped has smoked salmon in it (very much like the gladly chopped but not as good IMO) and dates. A nice salad. The Mac was fantastic--cheesy but not overwhelming. It has a spicy dollop of pepper relish that you can mix in our take in small bites with your Mac. It's not visually appealing, but it tastes great. Taste it before you mix it completely with the Mac. The star of the show was the steak. Cooked to perfection and seasoned so well! Just a great steak. Served with, I think they were called potato croquettes and roasted vegetables. Oh yes. Nothing on the dessert Keanu piqued my interest so we passed."}
{"text":"Went in Saturday for the first time to have brunch. This atmosphere and vibe of this place is awesome! It is simple yet industrial on outside but the inside is elegant and stunning. Perfect place for any occasion to have a girls day, date night, or host a party. Our server was a gentlemen and he was fantastic! Unfortunately I don't remember is name. This place was pretty busy but I love that they accept reservations and it's easy to make on yelp. I love the open kitchen concept where you can see all the fresh ingredients and amazing food they are putting out.  $15 for unlimited champagne during brunch, extra $2 to add a glass of OJ which lasted about 3 refills. I also got a lemonade which was fresh squeezed and the best I have ever had! So refreshing and would make a great summer cocktail. The food menu was great with a ton of options. I got the grilled cheese melt with tomato soup. It was very good and the perfect portion. The soup was pretty simple but paired well with the amazing grilled cheese filled with crisp bacon!! My friend got the roasted pulled chicken sandwich which was huge and looked incredible. She enjoyed it as well! We ended the meal with the apple berry crastada dessert which was light and had the perfect amount of sweetness.   Overall everything from atmosphere, service, and food was excellent. We had such a great time. I can't wait to come back and bring friends and bring my husband for date night. Dying to try that famous huge tomahawk steak for dinner! See you again soon! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Decent vibe, busy place. $85 steak was sub-par, looks like the kitchen stays busy, warmed-over side dishes were not really fresh. Service at the bar was ok, they gave away my seat while I was in the restroom. Mediocre experience, but not worth the price."}
{"text":"The entrance was grand with the biggest yellow door I've ever see!  This place is definitely trendy and hip.  Everyone was beautiful and dressed to impress. I was here to celebrate my girlfriend's engagement.   Food:Tomahawk with creamy mash truffle potato and mixed vegetables. My girlfriend ordered it, she said it was very flavorful and  extremely juicy. It was a surf and turf with grilled shrimp which were a little dry but still had flavor.    Her fiancee ordered a sirloin steak with the same sides, boy did it look awesome.   All of the alcoholic drinks were awesome! Order the French martini....so yummy!   Our waitress was Carissa who was attentive and helpful.  Every item Carissa recommended was excellent.    Dessert: a delicious coconut, chocolate layered cake.   Make sure you bring money, the tomahawk was $89 but it feeds two people (so why did my girlfriend eat the entire thing herself) lol..   This place is a great hang out with the girls, wife or girlfriend date night, side chick date night, the girl your trying to make your girlfriend jealous with.....you know! It's the new must be seen place and with good food too!"}
{"text":"Stopped for a second supper close to closing time. The nicoise salad was fine with nicely seared tuna and an decent dressing. B ordered the feta & melon salad- nice and light. Smashed fingerlings were served nice and hot. Pretty place with good, if not particularly memorable, food."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere is amazing! The only reason I am giving a three is because of the HORRIBLE service we got from Trish the bartender. Started out with slamming cups down while she was making drinks we couldn't even carry on a conversation.She was rude from the start, spilled a drink all over my phone and into my lap didn't apologize and continued the insulting service. I could continue on but I will stop here. I really hope she is OK and was just having a really bad day. Needless to say the manager was nice, WE did end up paying our entire bill and our drinks."}
{"text":"This place is one of the most beautiful dining experiences I've ever had! Jordan was our server and he did an absolutely astonishing performance, his recommendations were amazing. I'll definitely be coming back not only for the amazing food but for his service."}
{"text":"So, at this time, I work across the street at Rusconi's American Kitchen. The whole area around this Shea / Tatum plaza doesn't have too many \"shining\" favorites (in my opinion). However, I LOVE this spot! On my lunch breaks, I go across the street and enjoy the Short Rib Dip, and the Charred Octopus. Both are excellent. The overall decor of The Covenant is vibrant, blue, open, and overall comfortable. The blonde lady bartender is always so sweet. The younger day bartender (shorter guy, beard, maybe 20-25?) also very polite and always on top of service.  For dinner, I love their wine selection and prices. Usually a bottle of Clark & Telephone (maybe 70 dollars which is a steal) along with the Chile Relleno or Short Rib.  An excellent spot, that would absolutely KILL IT in a spot like the Quarter or near Fashion Square."}
{"text":"I've stopped here a few times for coffee on my way to work.. amazing coffee, friendly team!  So I've been super excited to try The Covenant for a full meal! It did not disappoint! We managed to make it for the last part of happy hour and I ordered the French 75. They had 2 cocktails on the menu, a few beers and some snacks. It was a really great drink! My friend and I split the ceviche appetizer, which might be the highlight of my WEEK! So fresh and light! I could eat this as an entree and be perfectly happy.  Next I ordered the beet salad. It was good but I wish there was more salad and less beets. (Yes I said it... and I love beets!) It was a bit overwhelming and I think the portion would be small if you don't also order an appetizer.  Overall--The atmosphere was great and it was pretty busy for a Tuesday night! I would definitely recommend The Covenant. I'll be back to try breakfast next!"}
{"text":"Came in earlier this evening and was in awe of the beautiful decor, valet parking (complementary). I did speak to the manager on the phone before hand and he was extremely professional. Upon entering the hostess didn't even smile when they greeted me and it was really awkward. Once i was seated my server came by and wasn't very informative, he seemed like he was possibly new. You would think that their would be higher standards for such an elegant establishment. Well I did order a French 75 and had a beet salad and the fire braised short rib. I was really disappointed in the food, it lacked flavor and for the prices that shouldn't be an issue. I spent nearly 80 dollars for myself and left unhappy. Received indignant looks from the staff. Probably won't be back. Too many restaurants all over the valley that offer better food and service for that price! Heck even restaurants that are inexpensive have better food and service."}
{"text":"I went to The Covenant for my anniversary dinner. The food was amazing and the service was great! My husband and I will definitely go back. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've probably been here 6 or 8 times since they opened so, obviously, it has been pretty good. Well not tonight. Our server, I forget her name, is one that I have had several times and she has always been great. Tonight, however, she had a table of 18 along with several other tables in addition to ours. Consequently our sever sightings were few and far between. My 2 big issues with my dinner tonight were 1) the size of the liquor pours. If you are going to charge $16+ for a drink, it should not be, insultingly, small. It is not as if I was ordering Pappy Van Winkle. Medium priced bourbon, tiny pour. Second, the Chorizo Chili Relleno was completely lacking chorizo. Bottom line it was a potato stuffed chili pepper. Now I have had this here before. It certainly was not like this (or I would have never ordered it again). By the time that our MIA server came back again, everyone, but me, had finished their meals. At this point, I was not about to get something else and have everyone hang around and watch me eat. Just a horrible dining experience. I can't say that I won't ever be back but unlike in the past I will never be the one to suggest it again."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited for the first time yesterday, meeting some friends for lunch. We had heard good things and were hoping for the best considering we drove all the  way from Surprise. The covenant didn't disappoint. This is a trendy yet comfortable spot. The wall of wine was huge and the atmosphere was modern but not too much for us to feel out of place. We were sat at a booth immediately and advised the hostess we were waiting on friends. We had water and drinks in front of us in no time. Once our friends arrived we started with an appetizer which was the hummus board. It was truly amazing and I would have been fine with just this and my glass of Moscato. Everyone at the table agreed and my wife wants to go back for it again!! I ordered the chorizo stuffed Chile relleno which was incredibly delicious. My wife ordered the melted grilled cheese with tomato, I want to call it bisque, which she said was amazing. Of our friends, one ordered a frittata which she said was delicious and it was also HUUUUUGE and her husband ordered the seared tuna sandwich which he greatly enjoyed. The Covenant is a wonderful place to enjoy some delicious food and enjoy a nice time with friends. I HIGHLY recommend it."}
{"text":"Very disappointed   This was my second visit as the first visit was not good, but it was only the third night for them being open. We ordered the Octopus which was salty and tough followed by the hanger steak which we couldn't even chew. Tonight ordered the ceviche which was bland and tasteless followed by the Scallops which were raw in the center. If you want to go for the atmosphere and cocktails... okay but do not eat the food!!"}
{"text":"First time here and glad to have a new hangout!!!  Beautiful interior.  Great food.  And our server Gabby was the most friendly gracious person ever.  We will definitely be back.  Avocado toast is off the charts."}
{"text":"It was a busy night, so we sat at the bar. We got an appetizer and placed our dinner order at the same time since it was busy. We finished the appetizer and were waiting for our meals. If had been over 45 mins since we put in our order, when they informed us that one of the dishes we ordered they were out of. We just decided to share the one they did have. They then told us the next drink and dessert was on them but then charged us for the dessert. I'm not sure if it was a bad night or just miss communication. I just don't think I would come here again. I know they tried to fix the problem and we were very understanding. Just not a place I want to go to again."}
{"text":"This new restaurant has a great vibe, interesting and stylish decor, and great food!!  The entrees are varied and the craft cocktails delicious!  A welcomed new place in this area!  So excited about this!!"}
{"text":"See the Check-In  review. Katie was great. Food fantastic and lov d watching the bartender in action."}
{"text":"The First Visit!  My experience was beyond my expectations. I thought I was just going to walk into a coffee shop and do some work . Little  did I know I was about to have the best meal I've had in months.  Amir was my waiter, or should I say my host . I felt more like I was visiting a friend and having a meal . Amir recommended my lunch  - the crabcakes on a bed of vegetables, The Farm salad  and it was way over-the-top delicious.  I eat out a lot and this place won my business and my heart . Great job The Covenant.  Ask for Amir if he's there and tell him Teri sent you."}
{"text":"I am sad to be giving this place a less than favorable review as I have been an OHSO regular since they opened in Arcadia; and knowing this is a sister restaraunt, I was excited to see what they had to offer!  Let me start with the positives: the location is great and the inside looks fab. We went during the day on Sunday and I imagine it looks even better at night with all the pretty light fixtures. Our bartender was friendly and our order came out fairly quick. I got the chicken sandwich with a side of the potato wedges which was tasty! Now for the not-so-positives....my boyfriend ordered the ravioli. For $19, we were expecting to be blown away. Unfortunately, it came out drizzled in olive oil and felt undone - I think some type of sauce/seasoning would have helped. The ravioli pieces themselves were half cold. The couple pieces we had that were warm tasted pretty good. We did let the bartender know about this and we're surprised to see he didn't either try to bring us a freshly cooked plate or comp that entree.  While we were there, it appeared to be during a shift change. It was odd that the manager was sitting just a couple seats over from us counting money with some of the waitstaff. I would have expected this to occur in a back office or something. Just felt a little unprofessional for a nice restaraunt.  My hope is that this place is still working out the early kinks as I think it could be a good addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"So here's the thing. Before I decided to write a review on this restaurant, I wanted to give it a few chances. I think it is only fair. Holding true to the photos, this place is definitely decorated vibrant, bold, unique and  the blue bar stools kinda scream,\"come hang out at the bar\". Their mission of making their own everything from scratch and farm to table experience is also why we went back more than once.  The hummus board is really good and it's an appetizer you don't see everywhere else. Good wine selection. BUT and it's a big BUT. The service is awful! I mean terrible. All three times we waited almost 10 min before someone came to see if we wanted drinks. Then it took so long to get them. She put he drinks on the table and quickly ran away and we waited another 10 min before she can back to see if we wanted anything else. Ummm yes, it's Friday night at 7pm , all four of us ordered wine.. of course we \"want something else\". All three times were the same. Poor service, long waits for drinks and food and the waitress , three different ones, were miserable and definitely didn't want to be there.  My girlfriend ordered a Chardonnay and it came out almost warm and we literally got an eye roll from our waitress when we asked for a new one. There are SO many other great places in Scottsdale to enjoy your evening. GO FIND THEM!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and food were great! However, the server was one of the worst I have ever had. We had ordered the hummus and seeing I am gluten free I kindly asked the server to bring out a side sliced cucumbers to go along with the hummus, I was told no, then I even offered to pay for a side of cucumbers in addition to the pricey $16 hummus and was still told no that it would ruin the chef's presentation. I have been to many restaurants a lot nicer than this one and they have always accommodated for me and don't worry about the chef's presentation. I asked him to please check with the chef or I would like a manager and he came back 5 minutes later and was able to bring me cucumbers. Then my friend I was with ordered the grilled cheese and asked for no bacon he made a joke of extra bacon and when our food finally arrived it did indeed have extra bacon on it, so we had to wait while they remade it. The place has great potential but seeing the service was not welcoming made it a very unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been waiting for the restaurant to open since construction started and were VERY excited to try the restaurant out.  Here's a brief summary:  The decor is VERY on point and quite nicely done.  The menu offers a lot of choices but out waiter wasn't very knowledgeable about the different meals (I get it, it's a new restaurant so this can be forgiven).  The atmosphere is VERY loud (both people noise and music), more bar like than an intimate restaurant setting as is evident by the fact that the majority of the space seems to be the large bar in the center of the restaurant with bar seating all the way around it.  My girlfriend ordered a salad with added pulled chicken, I guessed there was probably only 3oz of chicken on the salad and it was very finely shredded.  Our server did bring an additional side of chicken for her upon our request and the Manager did come over to apologize.  I had the salad niÃ§oise and it was good with a fair amount of Tuna.  My biggest disappointment (beyond how noisy it was) was that the wine menu is EXTREMELY overpriced with a glass of Cabernet ranging from $14 to $18.  This seems rather high compared to similar restaurants in the area.  We will give The Covenant one more try, but I don't see it becoming a regular dining spot for us."}
{"text":"It's always hard to watch a restaurant in their first week.    The Good:  The location is great.  The decor is very pretty.  The Typical Growing Pains: The servers and managers looked completely overwhelmed.  There wasn't much food coming out and you could see there was major confusion at both the bar and kitchen regarding orders.  We had planned to eat dinner but gave up on that idea.  The 'You Probably Should Fix This':  The bar needs to step it up. Example: the party next to us wanted martinis and their vodka choice was limited to Kettle One; then they didn't have stuffed olives....they gave up and just ordered something over ice.  You can't stock a Scottsdale restaurant like an airport bar.   And drinks aren't inexpensive here either....nor is the food.  We'll go back to give them another try after they have a chance to work through their first few weeks.  If nothing else it could be a pretty place to go for happy hour."}
{"text":"Tried The Covenant today with my son. I've been in the area for years and have seen the establishment change from business to business several times. Upon driving up I was impressed with the aesthetic of the outside, but was nothing compared to when I walked in the door. I'm by no means a expert of interior design so I wouldn't even know where to begin with the style, all I know is it felt good when I walked in and felt very cool. When I stepped up to the register I was kindly greeted by a friendly gentleman named Jake. Being my first time here I asked what he recommended and he gave his suggestion. Not seeing it on the menu I gave my trust in his judgment and was not disappointed. It's some type of hot chai/mocha/almond milk concoction and MAN! is it good. My son got a hot chocolate and he seemed as satisfied as a kid can get. My curiosity doesn't always lead me to the best of places, but I can assure you I'll be back to try the other offerings that The Covenant has to offer."}
{"text":"The Avocado Toast and Mochaccino Coffee  we go here often on Sundays before we grocery shop at Whole Foods! I also read they have bottomless Mimosas for brunch but I have yet to take advantage of that!!   I do love the setup of the place, it's beautiful and has great color tones, brightness, plants, and seating options! It's a great place for dinner, lunch or brunch!"}
{"text":"We had an early dinner at the bar on a Sunday. We were surprised to hear that Sundays bottles of wine are 1/2 off. The restaurant is beautiful with a view of the massive open air kitchen. The short rib beef raviolis were outstanding, and the crab cake was all crab..the centrally staged bar is the main feature of the restaurant.. the service staff was very accommodating and responsive. A good dining experience."}
{"text":"Amazing food and intimate atmosphere...not a picky person when it comes to food but couldn't help but not rate this restaurant with all 5 stars.  Boyfriend and I will be coming back and recommending this place to many of our friends and coworkers (physicians, nurses, therapists, etc.)"}
{"text":"Totally impressed by this new hotspot from start to finish.  I've been there on two occasions so far and definitely plan to make it part of the regular rotation.  Walking into the restaurant, the colors and decor immediately pop with originality and stand distinguished amongst the crowd of other strong Phoenix culinary destinations.  A number of high definition screens are spaced evenly over the bar area but are also big enough for the surrounding tables to appreciate.  Bathrooms get a thumbs up for cleanliness.  On to the food - it's a fantastic mix that appropriately falls under the \"New American\" designation and truly includes something for everyone.  What is so fantastic about Covenant though are their unique riffs on familiar foods.  For example, rather than a standard burger they do a chorizo blend burger that is spiced to perfection and primed to trigger some binge eating.  Additionally, while a lot of other restaurants seem to veer away from doing a hummus appetizer these days (unfortunate), Covenant not only does it but adds their own mix of unique grilled vegetables and some drizzled honey.  I have yet to try their brunch menu but again, their blend and array of dishes is more than a little eye catching.  On the cocktail front, their signature cocktails are memorable and balanced to perfection.  For tequila lovers, the Handshake Deal is a must-have.  Although I wasn't able to pry myself away from the cocktails there yet, wine lovers will be pleased to know that their selection is a tour de force.  Considering that many restaurants don't have any Zinfandels on their menu, the fact that Covenant offers four different Zins should put things in perspective.  In other words, if you love wine and have a pulse, you're in good hands.  Finally, the service here deserves a special mention.  All staff were above-average pleasant and friendly to interact with, including the second time when a trainee was involved.  During my second visit we experienced two notable mistakes (plus the kitchen ran out of a dish), however, what really won me over was how the staff handled these incidents.  In each case, staff members not only immediately acknowledged and owned the mistake but they also really went out of their way to make sure things were fixed and our party was happy.  Their efforts meant a lot to us and we really left there feeling blown away by how professional the whole operation is run in all aspects.  While I would not hesitate to call attention to any restaurant's deficits, I have yet to find a negative things I would say about The Covenant.  Highly recommended.  Ambiance: 4.5/5 Food: 5/5 Service: 5/5 Value: 4.5"}
{"text":"Had a great visit with some co-workers for lunch. Our server was really sweet and had that fine dining polish to service. The food was really good especially the steak ravioli and the hummus board. My chopped salad was good, a little heavy on the blue cheese crumbles, though. It's pricey and swanky but for what it is, it's a solid spot"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and friends told me the dinner fare is great, but very pricey....Welcome to PV! The FREE October coffee month brought me in the door. Beautifully appointed restaurant with easy parking.   Coffee was not bitter, hot, and the baristas were very friendly. The Savory Scone was delicious!! Looking forward to reviewing after I find the time to dine during dinner hours."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place.  Great food and great service.  Also aware of Gluten-free eating challenges.  I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"The hummus appetizer was incredible.  Chile rellenos are un-traditional, but incredibly good. Would be even better with a little more chorizo, and maybe some homemade salsa or hot sauce on the sito kick it up a bit.  Bar did a great job, service was great, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great new restaurant in Paradise Valley.....the brunch today was excellent. The corned beef hash and biscuits & chorizo gravy won't disappoint. Delish! As for dinner, we just love the poke tuna! A must!  If you want a burger w a twist, try the chorizo burger, super flavorful. Happy hour now has food to go along with the happy hour drinks! M-F 3-6. Pretty swanky place, just what we needed."}
{"text":"I found this place when looking for a central place for my friends and I to meet for our Saturday night dinner.  I wanted a place that offered different types of meals from great quality cut steaks to hamburgers.  This place had it!   When you first walk in the place is absolutely beautiful.  Different styles of seating areas from booths, to tables to high tops and the bar.  For dinner we started off with the shrimp and crab ceviche (unfortunately no pictures of that... sorry).    For dinner we ordered: Cedar Plank Salmon, Steak and truffled mashed potatoes, and Salade Nicoise. (See Pictures)  For dessert: Waffle topped with ice cream and berries, Creme BrÃ»lÃ©e, and Berry Crostada. (See pictures)  Everything was delicious!!! Now, the ONLY reason for the 4 Stars versus 5 Stars is because the seating in our booth were very dingy and dirty. I am so picky when it comes to cleanliness.  However the service was wonderful and we definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite spots!! We sat at the bar and found the drinks to be moderately priced. We ordered the Poke Tuna, which was phenomenal! Highly recommend this appetizer! We ordered two entrees to both try, steak and the scallops. The steak was cooked perfectly! The portions were perfect! For dessert we ordered the apple pastry dish. It was unique and delicious. With dessert we had two coffee drinks. Wow - really good and HUGE! Well worth the $4!! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The Covenant is a sister restaurant of one of my favorite outdoor establishments, OHSO.    The place looks great; kudos to their designer.  I've been here a couple of times, including the grand opening; the appetizers we tried were good.  They are still working out those little kinks that all new restaurants have.  I'm giving them a 4 star rating for their potential."}
{"text":"What a great experience! We were seated at the large wood table, tucked between the whiskey wall and wine staircase and it felt so regal! We started with the hummus board and it was beautiful in presentation and beyond delicious, so flavorful! For my entree I had the French Dip sandwich, also delicious and flavorful! I will definitely order again! The wine menu is perfection and I love all the by the glass options. I'm excited to try more items on the menu.  The decor is beautiful, you can tell there was a lot of attention to detail. I can see lots of nights and Sunday brunches at the Covenant in my future!"}
{"text":"Had dinner. No plant-based entree options!  You guys need to get with the latest research on the best diet for the human body.   The hummus platter was the only truly nutritious dish and it was delish!  The cook was unwilling to put something together for me for a plant-based entree. Now that's just being lazy or arrogant.  Then my son ordered a whiskey neat and was charged $19!  They didn't tell us until the bill came that they double the charge for a neat. That's a first! The 2 stars are for the decor and the hummus platter. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is alright.  I am confused by the name.  I  am confused by the decor.  I didn't expect this place to have such an upscale feel.  The name and the color of the door and signage led me to believe that I was going to be walking into a unique situation. The menu selection is basic.  Nothing notable or super creative. The theme was very little protein.  The poke app was MAYBE 2 ounces of fish with too much sauce on an oversized wonton. The tuna bahn mi had about 3 ounces of fish (thinly sliced).  The baguette was not toasted and was heavily doused in vinegar. I don't know how the 900 degree oven plays a role, I suppose I will never find out since I don't have a strong desire to return. Strange restaurant. UPDATE: Just discovered that O.H.S.O. is a sister restaurant.  Makes sense. The food at O.H.S.O is just alright, but is priced well.  The atmosphere at O.H.S.O. is chill and fun.  I would rather eat \"just alright\"  at better prices at O.H.S.O. If I was choosing between the two restaurants."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place, the decor is awesome and menu looked great. We came for an early dinner and there were maybe 6 tables in the large restaurant. After being seated we waited and waited for a server. Just as we were about to get up and ask he came over- \"what can I get you to drink?\" Umm a hello would be nice.. this monotone and unfriendly \"service\" lasted the whole meal and was so unwelcoming we didn't stay for dessert but walked to the yogurt store next door. When asked about the menu or recommendations, \"everything is good\" is not a sufficient answer, or helpful. Food was good but not great for the price and was barely warm. Not sure I would give this place another shot."}
{"text":"This is the new hot spot ! Hubby & I have been here a few times already & each time we have been impressed. Great food, great service. The ambiance is very hip and sleek.  The avocado toast & grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup hit the spot last Sunday . This new restaurant has been slammed since its opening , we are excited to try more dishes & cocktails."}
{"text":"Love this place. A little pricy but the beat and goat cheese bruchetta and the short ribs are two things I love. Great wine selection also not cheap. Bartenders are friendly and my only recommendation is service gets really slow when they are busy so be aware and be patient."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place more seeing that it is close to home. It is beautifully decorated and their food presentation is stunning as you can tell by the photo of my ravioli. The service was on point and the the staff was super friendly. That being said the food was lack-luster. Hubs had the chicken romesco sandwich which sounded amazingly complex but had no wow factor taste wise. My ravioli had great potential with crispy prosciutto, toasted pine nuts and peas but the filling of short ribs was missing the punch of flavor it needed to complete the dish. With all the good points it had, the food is the most important thing and it was just ok. May give them some time to tweak the menu and try again since it had potential."}
{"text":"The location and ambiance in this place is great, but I was severely disappointed in the quality of food and service. The tables I was seated at (directly to the right when you walk in) are incredibly close to each other and our waitress kept trying to fit between our table and the one next to us to take our order and check on us. This is a better alternative to shouting, but I think they could work on the layout to make it easier on staff and patrons. It was also incredibly uncomfortable to be seated at a high-top style table right next to a booth where the booth is directly facing me eating.   I got the braised beef ravioli and it was oily and not worth the price. My boyfriend got the chef's cheddar mac, which he said was subpar. If you're looking to have an \"okay\" meal for a higher-end price in a ritzy locale, this is your place. Overall, I didn't feel I got the most bang for my buck and don't plan on returning.  Ambiance - great Food - okay Service - okay Price - not worth it"}
{"text":"While all restaurants having growing pains during the first few weeks, this one knows how to adjust and make their customers happy.  The menu is interesting offering a great variety.  The CHARCUTERIE BOARD is delicious and filling!  Their house bread is addicting...its warm and light and soft!  the drink menu is fun and the wine is great!  The staff knows their wines and the bar tenders are fun and lively!  We have been their 3xs and tried a few different things  We went with a large group and shared the Tomahawk steak  It was amazing! The grilled cheese and soup are a treat.  The SALAD NIÃOISE was really fresh and light.  The manager Woo is awesome and the host staff is cool and pleasant despite the buzz and the crowd!"}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this place since we live so close, but it wasn't awesome. The place is quite small. I think they said it only seats just over 100 people? The drink menu was meh and the food was good but not GREAT. We started with the octopus, which I enjoyed, but hubby didn't. Then we shared short rib ravioli and the chorizo burger. Both recommended by the waitress as best options on the menu. They were both good but a tad salty. I know this place is newer so perhaps they're still ironing out the kinks but we still prefer Rusconi's across the street."}
{"text":"I was excited to find a new local restaurant in my neighborhood and The Covenant is just what we needed. The decor is casually elegant with inviting fabrics, lighting, fresh air and fresh flowers.  Music was playing just loud enough to notice but not overbearing to invade conversation.The menu has a great selection of unique finds and trusted favorites without being too large.  Our server Marie was knowledgeable, personable, and efficient. Overall a very good place that I will definitely frequent."}
{"text":"The decor and ambiance is unique and welcoming, a nice little surprise when you walk in! We had a pleasant server who suggested a grapefruit vodka cocktail which was refreshing and exactly what we wanted. We had a yummy goat cheese and beet bruschetta board for an app, but after seeing our neighboring table with their hummus board I was jealous - will definitely try that interesting take on hummus next time! Dinner for us was a lovely sea bass with Brussels sprouts and a chopped salad with smoked salmon. We split the meals and enjoyed them both. We each commented how we had never had such a unique take on a chopped salad. Overall we enjoyed our entire experience and will be definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time here! But I'll likely be back. Dinner was great, on a Friday night it was about a 30 minute wait for 3 people. But they do get your number and can text you while you wait. The hostess was a bit rude, but it was a busy night. Our server though was so sweet!  So food, we ordered the prime rib dip, the chefs mac, and the roasted chicken. I think everyone's favorite was the roasted chicken, it was so flavorful! I loved the chefs mac- it included shrimp and sausage. Prime rib was also great, there were no leftovers ha. I'm going to come back during the day to try their coffee bar! It has its own separate little checkout area and menu."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing atmosphere. Gabby was AMAZING! Definitely a place you have to try."}
{"text":"Everything I ate was delicious. I want to try everything on the menu. The short rib was cooked perfectly. The beat salad is unique and unlike any other beat salad you'll ever have. You'll have to order it to see why!  The Covenant is my new favorite place to be."}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 3/5 Happiness - 3/5  My wife and I went here at an off-peak time to have a couple of drinks while our kids were at an event. I had been eying this place for quite awhile. And... it was OK.   The biggest barrier was the price. Virtually every drink was over $10.00. And they were all fine, but not particularly memorable. I also ordered a fancy mocha and I just wasn't blown away by it. The bitterness of the espresso overwhelmed the other flavors.  We also split a salad of roasted veggies, field greens, and additional hangar steak. The steak was absolutely cooked to perfection (I'd come back to try out a full steak for sure), but the greens were a bit too wilted and the veggies unremarkable. It was also essentially a $20 salad! The service was also disappointingly slow, particularly as we were one of only about three tables there.   Nothing particularly wrong with The Covenant, but outside of the steak, I just didn't get a lot out of it."}
{"text":"Had our first brunch here and so impressed.  What a great location and beautiful interior.  Our server Gabby was the best ever. We will be back just to see her!!!   Thanks for a great Sunday funday!!!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest we initially wanted to go to OHSO and ended up here due to the wait. This place had a small wait as well but we were lucky enough to luck out on four spots at the bar - and it was GREAT!  The decor is amazing. The blue leather chairs are an incredible design touch. Indoor/outdoor feel with open windows and desert plant accents made for a wonderful esthetic.   On to the important parts. Our bartender, Wyatt, went out of his way to make our experience excellent! He was above and beyond with customer service! And the food was incredible. Get the biscuits and gravy!"}
{"text":"My mom and I popped in around 2:30pm on a Monday about three weeks after The Covenant's doors opened. We thoroughly enjoyed our time at the restaurant. We both agreed that the hummus platter was the best either of us has ever had; the veggies were roasted perfectly and there was the slightest bit of honey, adding the perfect touch. We also had the chopped salad (with no smoked salmon) and it was delightful. The service, atmosphere, food, drinks, parking, etc were all amazing. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I loved, loved, loved the way I felt when I walked in here. So gorgeous and modern, yet classy and elegant. 6 friends and I came for brunch on a Saturday morning. The server was kind enough, he got us our coffee and drinks no problem. We ordered the avocado toast for the table. That's when it went downhill. Really nothing special, and there were 4 pieces while the waiter said 5. Next, I ordered the frittata. Like the avocado toast, it was very bland. Pretty tasteless, actually, that I had to douse it in Cholula and even then it barely cut it. My friend had a breakfast bowl, and said the only thing that saved it was the avocado salsa. Which is supposed to be a garnish. So all in all, the taste didn't live up to the beauty and I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Our food was outstanding but everything else was just \"meh.\"  We came here early around 5:30 (hiking all the way up to Tom's dang Thumb will make you ravenous for the rest of the day!) but were told all the empty tables were being held for reservations. We were offered spots at the bar or to take seats at their \"communal tables\"...I'm usually fine with communal tables, since they're long and spaced out for parties. These were two separate 6 tops. We had another couple join the table in the middle of our meal and it was just...weird. At least join the two together to space people out? I noticed at least two other parties walk in, say they didn't have a reservation, but then get seated at a table. Huh.  Anyway, we wait way too long for our server to greet us. She apologized, but we were about to walk out. (See previous review re: Fox RC's being the only ones to do it right, which is so odd to me.) Luckily, the food was great. The hummus board is a work of art, and all the veggies were drizzled with pesto and local honey. It was such a great, beautiful version of a hummus appetizer. I opted for the half chicken, which was served with some more of the same roasted veggies and smashed, roasted fingerlings. It was all delicious, as was my husband's braised short rib over risotto. The wait between our appetizer and main course was, again, way too long.  We spent over $100 for dinner, and were just a little underwhelmed by everything but the food. Probably a pass in the future. But kudos to the kitchen."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and decor was beautiful! The beer and wine was great! We thought the customer service was lacking. We were the only people sitting at the bar at happy hour and it took a while for someone to approach us. The bartender actually never said a word or made eye contact...I believe it was a manager that took care of us. We really want this new place to be successful, but for the price, we hope for a better experience next time."}
{"text":"This place is beyond gorgeous!!! I've been wanting to come here for a long time and finally made it happen! Our waitress was awesome and the whole staff was friendly.   Now let's talk about the food! Delicious! I got the veggie omelette with avocado. The way they cook the food is top notch , and it was nice to see them making ours!!! Fresh local produce , amazing taste that you don't have to add anything and the presentation PERFECTO!. They put the heart in soul of making these dishes! Perfect for Brunch, and 15 unlimited mimosas is a steal! Come check it out for the food the drinks and of course the ambiance!! Will be back again soon! Cannot is wait to try the dinner! Cheers!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch last week.  The nicest person was the hostess.  Our waiter Joe did not even tell us his name and was not at all personable but rather kind of rude.  I think the owner needs to decide if she wants this place to be upscale or a sports bar as there are 6 tvs over the bar.  There is really nothing special about the food.  Everything is pretty much overpriced expect about $30 per person just for lunch.  The salad we ordered was nothing special and salads are better at sweet tomatoes or any other place.  The prime rib dip we ordered which we were told would be a foot long actually was only 6 inches and again nothing special but rather very boring.  The ladies bathroom had nice wooden doors and cool ceiling but the tile floor makes it dingy and dirty looking. The blue and silver decor inside the dining hall is real nice and different.  We wanted to like it but with a rude waiter plus boring & overpriced food is not a place for us to go back.  It was nice to try."}
{"text":"We have been looking forward to checking this new place out, and did last night for my daughters birthday.  I made the reservation and let them know about the special occasion as well.  I was surprised how busy it was for a Monday night.    They seated us in the very back corner near the restroom which made me disappointed.  Thought the reservation and special occasion would have told them to reserve a nicer spot.  Didn't want to ruin the occasion so ignored it.  It took awhile for us to get waited on but she finally came and was friendly.  Not to be snobby, but her attire was unexpected \"plaid casual shirt\", just didn't fit the place.  Oh well whatever.  Service started out good but went down hill rest of our night.  They didn't notice a fork was missing and waited awhile for someone to even walk by looking our way to wave them down while food was getting cold.  Got birthday dessert with no candle and no silverware??????  Again, long wait before we can flag them down.    It's pricey, elegant but service needs some attention to.  Food was good tho!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service,  exceptional in every aspect. Try the clams. They are worth it."}
{"text":"Came by for a martini after work could not get a club soda. They don't sell it by the glass. This is my 3 time here. Strike 3."}
{"text":"I wanted SObadly to love this restaurant but it was just ehh. The location and dÃ©cor is amazing. I loved the atmosphere and the service was pretty good as well.   The issues lay in the food and price. I went there for lunch and spent $47 on a sandwich, salad and 2 iced teas. I don't mind paying the price for top notch food but this food was not it. I had the Feta and Melon salad. Luckily I added ahi tuna or else I would have been left with just a bowl of fruit. I expected a little more salad and a little less fruit. There didn't seem to be a dressing on it all, just the spices and juice from the fruit. Honestly the avocado and  tune saved the meal for me. My mom had the Chicken Romanesco sandwich. The sandwich was actually really good ( wish I had ordered that) but she ordered a side of vegetables that had almost no seasoning on them and seemed a bit over done.   I am truly hoping that the menu improves. Its way too expensive for the mediocre food. For now I will go to O.H.S.O."}
{"text":"First time here. Have been meaning to come since it opened. Oh so glad to be here.  First impression.... Wow!! First the bright yellow door outside! Love it! Inside I would call it industrial Glam!! Beautiful Blue chairs and chandeliers! Stunning.  Our server was wonderful!!  Started with some beer. The menu was beautiful. What to order? I was between the Poke or the crab cake or the grilled Octopus. Server said.... go with the Octopus! Done!!!  My friend ordered the goat cheese and beer salad.  Both arrived and were beautiful. Great presentation! Mine was spectacular! Was served in a tomato broth with chorizo and potatoes. And a warm pita. I could have eaten another order!  Friend said her salad was great too. ( I'm not a beer fan!!) Wine list looked great.... it was just so hot out I wanted beer!"}
{"text":"Turning into an area & local destination.    Great decisions by the owner/developers to include a gourmet coffee bar opening at 7am daily. Ambiance is off the charts including its Staff and wonderfully caring people like Jake (at the coffee bar).  They also have scintillating breakfast items which we found out this am.  Have now lunched here 3x's and the menu is so creative.  You will not find a roasted vegetable & hummus plate (with homemade pita bread) anywhere like The Covenant.  Executive Chef Richard is a quality freak as he surveys EVERY meal before it is delivered by their wonderful Servers. We witnessed him telling our Server that he refused to prepare the daily fresh Ahi as that day's delivery was not up to his standards.  Very refreshing to know that he equally wants to uphold the Brand while protecting the newly minted & coveted Covenant clientele.   Not to be outdone, Chris was a passionate foodie/server & outstanding gent.  Have to love how The Covenant has attracted such talent.  The love for this place just amps higher & higher. A destination appeal while earning its 5 Star stripes....."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, too soon to judge the service since it just opened but they are very friendly. I liked the brunch menu but want to go back for dinner. Its great for groups and has an open air feel so will truly dominate in cooler weather. They were very accommodating with the menu for gluten free options."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went for dinner on a Friday night. We sat at the bar. Worst service in town. Bar wasn't even half full and the bartender said she was too busy to get us drinks. We waited for a solid 30 mins to get a drink. Would not recommend this place solely based on the terrible service."}
{"text":"Great new place - sat at the bar and enjoyed a nice glass of wine and some food. Goat cheese bruschetta was great and the head server gave us a free order of poke tuna nachos that they had made by mistake. Unfortunately they were out of our first choice main -- beef ravioli -- so we opted for the Mexican stuffed pepper, which was good (not great). Really liked the atmosphere and it was nice that they stayed open past 10pm. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delightful restaurant! Great food, beautiful interior atmosphere and super service. I watched this restaurant being built. Well worth the wait! Give it a try. You'll definitely enjoy."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant! Amir was our server and was the best server we've had in a long time. Fun, attentive, and so informative about the food. The meal was amazing and I'd recommend The Covenant to anyone."}
{"text":"I've only been to The Covenant twice, the food was decent enough but in this case it was the service that upset me.  I have two real pet peeves, one being when you order your food before the table sitting next to you and your food arrives much later, like after the people at the next table have finished eating.  The other is when this happens and there are other service failures the establishment does not rectify them with a sense of urgency.  My wife and I had a different server than the couple sitting right next to us.  We put our order in about 4 or five minutes before they did.  I noticed that they ordered the exact same thing as my wife.   Over a half hour later, they receive their food and are now finishing up and our food has not arrived, even after our server assured us it would arrive soon.  It finally comes, delivered by the manager or expeditor.  My wife had requested no cheese and no cream, and it has cream sauce all over.  Not the server's fault because he repeated the order back to sans cheese and cream.    So we immediately notify the manager that the order is wrong before he can get away and he takes it back to the kitchen to correct the order.  Now, when you've been waiting so long for your food and it comes out wrong, I would typically expect some sense of urgency to correct it.  So we're waiting and waiting and I'm seeing dishes coming out of the kitchen, even the same dish my wife ordered going to other tables.  I feel like in this situation, you should go to the front of the line.  All they had to do was scramble some eggs, everything else was pre-braised.  So after about another 15 to 20 minutes her order finally comes correct.  No apology, no recognition of the service failure. Granted it was during Sunday brunch, but only we seemed to have problems getting our food.    In any case, the food is not good enough to overcome these service failures especially at this price point ($$$).    Fool me once shame on you!"}
{"text":"Great vibe, very open feel and beautifully decorated.  The food was delicious,  all five of us were happy with our choices. The only reason that I didn't give it a 5 star is because the mark up of the wine is ridiculous and they should take a consideration charging $19.00 for a glass of wine that the bottle could be purchased for $17.99"}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend to try out their brunch. We had been wanting to check it out for a while especially because the place looks so cool from the outside as you drive by and it's always full. I'll start off by saying the service was good, our waiter was helpful and friendly even when they messed up our drink order - no big deal. The biggest problem was the food, my boyfriend ordered the chorizo chili relleno which sounded amazing and for 21 dollars it should have been, it was plated nice but the flavors were just bland and there was definitely no chorizo. Also wasn't exactly a relleno which is usually fried, this was just a stuffed pepper. I ordered the smoked salmon plate and it wasn't so great either, the pita bread it was on had a weird taste like it was old. We spent 50 bucks for a meal that neither of us were even satisfied with. Overall if the prices were better we might have given it another chance but I can't justify spending that much for food that I don't enjoy. You could walk across the parking lot and go to OHSO and get a better brunch for half the price."}
{"text":"Went for lunch about a week after opening--figured we would let them work out kinks--I am a former restaurant manager with several openings under my belt--I know the drill.  Decor is beautiful, but my husband felt it was too feminine--especially for a place advertising a \"wood-fired 900 degree grill\". Felt it was like a woman's bathroom.  He was expecting a little more of a masculine or at least neutral decor. I loved the decor, and love that their high tables come with a foot rest, but would appreciate more room between them--I don't want to eat with people I did not invite to my lunch.  The restaurant itself was HOT--so much so my husband was sweating at the table and it was not comfortable in there for lunch.  Server was very pleasant but did not know the menu well--by this point I would have expected her too.  Was served half a grilled cheese sandwich and small bowl of soup (menu did not say half sandwich) and while I was fine, anyone with a larger appetite would have gone away hungry. Tomato was sliced too thick and overpowered the sandwich--almost couldn't taste the cheese.  My husband said his burger was very good, fingerling potatoes were just OK.  We ordered water since the wine was a bit pricey for us at lunch.  I WANT to love this place--I really do, as I think PV needs it, so I hope the management is reading the reviews.  Needs: Better AC; more food per plate at the price point (lunch without drinks was just about $40 for 2 with tip), a few wine choices closer to the $10 per glass mark, at least at lunch, a happy hour menu, a few more things that are actually \"wood-fired\" on the grill.  We will try it again, but if things don't improve, it won't become a regular place for us and we were really hoping it would.  We live close and would like to make it a regular stop."}
{"text":"So I finally tried the covenant for happy hour. This is an interesting location that at one time was a shoe store and also a vitamin store. You would never know it when you walk in today.  It's a bit of a trendy bar and restaurant. But there's a little bit more substance than just sizzle. They are very much into using local supplies from farmers and other artisan purveyors. Maybe they take it a step too far, in the fact that of the beer that they have on tap, half of them are from OHSO, which has a location in the next parking lot. I would've liked to see other wonderful local beer choices. (If I wanted OHSO's beer, I would've gone there, just saying).   It's got a wonderful open feeling in the restaurant. The kitchen is totally viewable from the bar. And you can see all of the bustling activity going on. The bar is also uniquely set up with a hundred bottles of alcohol attractively displayed. As you move toward the back of the restaurant they have a very large wine storage glass locker that goes from floor to ceiling Maybe 16 or 18 feet tall.  The crabcake is very attractively served on a bed of arugula and unlike others it is not filled with crackers. I liked the charred octopus but would not preferred that come with roasted potatoes. They have a nice charcuterie board as well as a hummus board. And a goat cheese bruschetta and I know the goat cheese comes from my friend Wendell Crow's Dairy.   I did not try any of the entrÃ©es since I was there for happy hour. That will be for another day."}
{"text":"I've been to the Covenant a few times before -- love the dÃ©cor and the fun atmosphere-- not too stuffy, not too casual.   The food and service have always been good... until last night.   Last night, the food and drinks were just fine as always but the service was stunningly BAD.   I noticed one or two favorable reviews on here about the server, Gabby.  That's who we had (or at least that's the name on the receipt) but surely we can't be talking about the same person.  The Gabby we had was The Worst. She could not have been more disinterested, unfriendly, uncaring.   She took our drink order, got the drinks delivered and then vanished.  Every so often we'd catch a glimpse of her chatting with other staff.  Finally we asked another server to please go get her.  He did so, she came to our table and the service deteriorated from there.   Gabby avoided eye contact the rest of the evening, never so much as cracked a smile, never asked if we needed anything, if our food was ok, nothing.  Every time we needed something (drinks), we waited and waited for her to re-appear and when one of us would catch a glimpse of her (always chatting with her co-workers), we'd wave frantically.  We ordered appetizers, discussing in front of Gabby our intent to split them among the four of us.  One of the seafood items we ordered arrived at our table with only one scallop.  Not exactly the kind of thing to split four ways.  A good  server would've made us aware of this and perhaps would've offered helpful suggestions of something more suitable for sharing.  Not Gabby.  She couldn't have been more disinterested.   She finally reappeared to take our dinner order and as mentioned before, the food (I had the salmon) was good and later on, when the plates had been cleared, we all thought we might want dessert.  We eventually found Gabby and asked about dessert possibilities.  She motioned for the hostess to bring dessert menus to us.  Sighhhh.  We gave up and decided not to prolong our stay there.  All in all, during our dinner and despite Gabby, the four of us in our group had a great time--  laughing and catching up on each other's news.  Each time Gabby came to the table, there was a chilling effect.  We made every effort to get her to smile/lighten up but no go.  Very disappointing, Covenant.  Not at all up to your standards."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd visit at Covenant.  First time was about a month ago where I had a great steak and decent service.  My last 2 visits were within this last week and service was not the best. Last night my waiter was running around that I couldn't even complete my sentence while talking to him and he would run off to another table.  Steak was not prepared as requested and had to send it back.  My friend was vegetarian and her food option was not available.  Waiter tried his best but I think it was too busy!  Hope they get things right because I love the location but I wont be returning for some time."}
{"text":"3 stars for now mainly due to the service. The food is 3 1/2 stars so far. The service at the bar was so so. Granted it was a busy night, the bartenders should be a bit more attentive. At least acknowledge you if it's too busy. I'm ok waiting as long as I'm acknowledged.  I'll give this another try after they work out the quirks and update my review. Hopefully there won't be as many pretentious Paradise Valley old farts there...  The octopus, risotto and beef short ribs were delicious, but it took quite a while to get our food.   I like the fact that they have valet because the parking lot is small."}
{"text":"Met a friend for late lunch. My first visit. Very interesting ambiance. My friend liked the decor a lot. Modern and whimsy. A bit noisy, not the place for a first date, IMO, good service. Had food related questions and the chef made time to come by and talk to us. We were impressed. The food was fine. Worth another visit, maybe happy hours?"}
{"text":"Great experience at this new, hot spot! Came in for brunch and had a delicious Salmon plate accompanied by a refreshing Bloody Mary. Service staff was very friendly, and the manager Aji was very accommodating. Can't wait to come back and bring friends."}
{"text":"So disappointed,food was ok very pricing I was expecting something better!! The server was great in the beginning!!....but later he brought us (my husband and me)dessert without saying anything we thought was a sample!! But he I did charge in the bills!! So manager was back and forth checking if we ordered or not.....!! So be careful!!"}
{"text":"Didn't think the food was comprable to the price. Little bit of an attitude behind the bar. Will not come back"}
{"text":"Though we live within walking distance, we waited almost a year to try this place out due to rumors of bad service,  figuring they needed to work the kinks out. Last night we had a reservation for a very early dinner with another couple. The restaurant was not crowded .I was immediately told by the young lady that my reservation for 4 was not found and then, that it had been canceled. I had made this reservation myself on the phone a week prior and showed the gal the confirmation text I had gotten the day before.... our male server had a bad attitude and seemed like the last thing he wanted to do was wait on us. He was very disinterested in answering menu questions and we had to ask him to wipe us a spill from the appetizer we ordered. I won't go on, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. At this price point, waiters should be way more happy and accommodating. I did not like my dining experience at all. A We will take our business elsewhere... no shortage of great places around here."}
{"text":"We met some friends for dinner and had a blast. Fun atmosphere, great service, excellent food! I loved the scallops, and the poke was also delicious. Everyone enjoyed their food. The wine wall thing is super cool. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome setup they have in there! The way the lighting hits everything, it definitely make the whole place feel very chic. Friend brought me here as we were looking for more organic, natural food after a movie. We found it, that's for sure! He had the salmon and veggies, which was a good helping. He said the flavors were all just right. I had the spicy tuna banh mi with side salad. Very delicious although didn't feel too authentically Vietnamese. However they never claimed it was and I'm sure the chef put his/her own twist on it. Very friendly service from Gabby and we appreciated the whole experience. Would recommend for drinks, food, and/or good social time!"}
{"text":"Went here last weekend for brunch with a girlfriend. This place is gorgeous! Teals and cream and lots of blinging lighting, huge bar with comfy seats and a beautiful glass wine tower with an open kitchen concept. Been eyeing it for the last month waiting for it to open and seeing the chandeliers go up sealed the deal!   The staff was super attentive and nice and most importantly the eggs benedict was in point. The portions are generous-even with my latte...it was huge and yummy.   The menu is simple but looks delicious...will totally be back for dinner for the scallops. On our way out saw some pastries that looked good too-will have to save room next time ;)"}
{"text":"I've been driving past The Covenant for weeks now curious about trying it. Today, I finally made it in for brunch, and I really enjoyed it! I will definitely return to check out their dinner menu sometime.   On to the details. We showed up on a Saturday and there were a few tables full, but it wasn't crazy busy by any means. Score! We were promptly seated and the greeted by our waiter. He was super nice and grabbed our drink orders, then returned for the rest. I was debating between a few options and he advised me to go with the Mexican breakfast bowl and I am so glad I did.   I really enjoyed the food. I had an espresso as well and it was perfect. My breakfast bowl had great flavor and had eggs, short rib, onions and peppers, cheese, avocado and some cilantro sour cream. Amazing. I will be ordering this again when I return for another brunch. They also have $15 bottomless champagne but I played it sober today, so I'll have to check that out on my return as well.   The overall decor and vibe of the place is probably the coolest part. It's modern and trendy and just a cool place to sit and hangout at, especially since it wasn't crazy today. The bathrooms were nice and clean and they had good music playing. They were a little slow on delivering our checks but we were all chatting and more tables were coming in so it's understandable. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great concept. Great food. Great cocktails. Had one bad server here that kind ruined a night with friends, but the bartenders are cool and the management seems genuine so I frequent this place.   Get the Lincoln drive, charred octopus for the appetizer and then the ravioli for your entree and you'll be feeling very nice."}
{"text":"Went to the Covenant for breakfast. This is a beautiful place. Great vibe. I got the grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup. My wife got french toast. The staff was very friendly. I had a Bloody Mary which was yummy. We placed our order and waited, and waited, and waited. Our waitress was very nice to make sure we knew our food would be coming soon. And we waited, and waited. Finally, and we were seriously considering just leaving, our food arrives. My wifes was cold. My grilled cheese has sat long enough so it was warm, but the cheese has already gone solid again. I like my grilled cheese hot and runny. The tomato soup was still \"warm\". My wife told the manager and he quickly took it away, brought back a fresh on, not reheated, and took it off our bill. I didn't make a fuss but told our server my thoughts about the food. She explained they had been open only two weeks and were still working out the kinks. I appreciate that a new place takes time to get their rhythm, but whoever was watching the kitchen should never let cold food out regardless of how long they have been open. It is their main purpose. I gave 3 stars because they seemed to really want to do things right. And even with the food not exactly right, it was really good. If it had been hot I believe it would have been amazing. I will try Covenant again and see how they progressed, but with so many great places to eat in this town and new places opening all the time, I will try again only once before writing it off. I will post an update after I go again."}
{"text":"My wife and I live in the area and were excited to see a new upscale restaurant coming to the neighborhood.  We frequent another restaurant that's near by that starts with and \"S\" and ends with an \"W\" and were really looking to forward to eating and drinking at The Covenant.  We had such high hopes of this place only to be extremely disappointed.  First of all the decor is very upscale but the noise is extremely loud, I liked that the kitchen is open for the customers to see but we didn't like the food.  We were going to order the charred octopus only to find out that they were out of it.  We ordered the poke tuna which was good and had good flavor.  For our entree my wife was going to get the short ribs but guess what, they are out of that as well so instead got the chef favorite chili relleno which was room temperature when she got it. They took it back and reheated the dish but when she got it back the sauce broke and was still not very hot.  I got the scallops which were very good.  I was also very underwhelmed by the drink selection  they have for their signature cocktails. All very girly and when we had ordered an off drink ( an old fashioned) it was horrible. My wife had ordered an gin martini wi th 3 olives and they forgot the olives in her drink.  Overall this place is very disappointing, but hopefully they will get it together I  the next couple of months."}
{"text":"You gonna wait for your food forever. Also the portions are small and very overpriced. There's nothing special about their food. I had half chicken and it was more like an 8th of chicken, not half..."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here two nights in a row it was so good! The service was wonderful - extremely kind, friendly staff. We had the salmon and scallops as our main entrees - delicious! The poke as an appetizer was one of the best starters I've had at any restaurant. And if you saved room for dessert, their waffle sundae is perfection. Definitely check them out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Trendy place -- Will definitely be back. Great covenant coffee cocktail and great wine selection. Just came for drinks so can't yet speak to food but presentation looks spectacular. Excellent service and cool vibe - tvs, nice furniture and food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here multiple times for everything from brunch to dinner and in between. I've taken clients here, I've met friends for happy hour. This place is absolutely fantastic and honestly the most consistent restaurant I've been to in the valley. The menu is inventive but not gratuitously so, the service is amazing every single time no matter who is bartending/serving, and the prices are fair. I love that they have valet, so parking is never an issue. The decor and atmosphere is very well-done. Definitely one of my favourite spots to visit."}
{"text":"The Covenant is a good local foodie restaurant, in a part of town that really needed it. The food that is good, is very good and the places where they miss the mark, they really miss the mark. Let's start with the bad. When I visited the Covenant for Brunch there was no drink specials. According to their website, they have since added $15 bottomless mimosas, but unless you want to get completely smashed on a Saturday or Sunday morning, a $5 Mimosa or Bloody Mary option like Rusconi's has across the street, would be a better offering in my opinion. For food I ordered the Roasted Vegetable Frittata. The menu says that it's made with farm fresh eggs, spinach, seasonal vegetables, heirloom tomato, basil, goat cheese, and an arugula salad for $13. There was no accompaniments, no side of potatoes, toast, or even salad like the menu states. Just the frittata. The salad is a green garnish on top. This was one of the worst breakfasts I may have ever ordered. I was hungry, it wasn't very tasty, and I was disappointed that the salad was a sad garnish. I ended up ordering a side of toast and jam, making the subpar meal even more expensive. My date had the biscuits and gravy. The eggs were cooked perfectly but overall presentation looked unappetizing. He said that it was OK but nothing great. I wouldn't recommend these two dishes, but there may be other items on the brunch menu worth ordering.  Lunch at the Covenant was AMAZING! I ordered the Grilled Cheese Melt white cheddar, sugar cured bacon, heirloom tomato, sourdough, with pesto tomato soup for $12. The white cheddar cheese is so rich and flavorful, the sugar cured bacon and the heirloom tomatoes are perfect and the pesto tomato soup was delicious too. Dinner at The Covenant was also good. We ordered the Half Roasted Chicken which comes with smashed fingerlings, roasted vegetables, pan sauce for $24 and the Butcher's Steak which is pepper crusted hanger steak and comes with crisp fingerlings, roasted vegetables, cipollini onion jam for $29. Although both were good the Chicken was definitely the star of these two options. The skin was perfectly crusted and the potatoes and roasted vegetables were cooked to perfection. The Steak was good but really paled in comparison to the Chicken which was the star. We also ordered an Espresso from their extensive coffee bar. It came in this fancy cup and was very tasty! The Dessert was to die for. I highly recommend saving room for the Berry Crostata. The flakey, buttery pastry was topped with roasted apple, fresh berries, drizzled with a sweet honey sauce and topped with fresh whipped cream. One of the best deserts around hands down.

{"text":"Decor was fantastic. Bartender was a bit absent minded/unobservant.  Menu is great. Chopped salad is missing some crunch (I think they missed the pepitas).  Octopus was great, but they could have thrown a couple extra tentacles.  Hanger steak was delicious and well plated...would have been better if came out hot."}
{"text":"Came here last night for a Mother's Day dinner w my in-laws. As soon as we parked, an overwhelming smell of fish consumed me...Wasn't sure if it's from the restaurant or someplace else.  Very cute interior. I loved the chandeliers and the open windows so it feels like you are outside but not technically since it was 96. Almost gave off a vintage lounge vibe..   As soon as we sat down, my husband ordered a bottle of Chardonnay and I got a glass of prosecco. A small wine selection but it was half off.. even better!   We started w the hummus board and goat cheese bruschetta. The hummus comes w roasted veggies n what made it soooo delicious was the honey!! The combination of savory n sweet! We all thought it was amazing!! The same w the bruschetta. The pistachios, dates, w goat cheese n also the orange blossom honey!! The sweet and savory combo was perfection!!! We also got the chef's cheddar Mac n cheese but without the sausage n shrimp n added chicken instead. It was very buttery n my tastebuds were very happy!!  As for my entree, I got the braised beef ravioli which was paired w a creamy pesto sauce, toasted pine nuts n crispy prosciutto. It was fantastic!! My husband got their pan seared scallops which was slightly undercooked but still very tasty.   Besides the screaming baby sitting behind me, N getting hit on the back of the head, I still enjoyed myself. And only complaint was that after our server dropped off our bill, he was never to b seen for like 15 min so my husband had to go find him...   Cute place n good food."}
{"text":"New to town and trying out nearby places. Went here on a whim since we were driving by. They were completely booked, but had family/communal-style seating open so we took that. Drinks were delicious and food was great. The salmon was really good, but the blistered veggies that came with it were bland and tasteless. That was disappointing. Overall service was good, but our waiter was a bit off, but maybe he was just overwhelmed because it was a busy night. We'll likely give this place another try in the future."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we were very disappointed with The Covenant. It was very hot inside which was uncomfortable. The atmosphere is nice and pretty but the food was a huge let down, especially considering the prices. I got the Chicken Romanesco sandwich & my  man got the half chicken. I thought the sandwich was gross & the chicken was just meh. The biggest turn off was the amount of flies that we had to keep waving off. I also don't understand the wood fire ovens and \"900\" degree concept without any pizza on the menu. Dessert was nice though and the service was good."}
{"text":"This is a happening place and a welcome addition to Paradise Valley.  You couldn't find a more convenient location on Tatum & Shea and the valet parking was perfect. Although we didn't have a reservation and they were quite busy at 7:30 on a Sunday night, the personable hostess accommodated us at a 'family table' in comfy, chairs and good space between us and the other diners at the table. Our waiter was efficient, friendly and pretty well familiar with the menu. I had the outstanding 1/2 grilled chicken with root vegetables and a glass of the house Chardonnay, which was complex and delicious.  My husband had a salad with the addition of grilled scallops.  While good, he said they were unremarkable.  He also had chocolate panna cotta for desert which was very tasty and a little different.  My 'dessert' was a Divine M coffee drink which was served chilled in a small champagne goblet.   Overall, we will be back for sure and I'm certain they will be 5* soon!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place so we came for lunch. Very pretty interior and great food. Friendly staff as well. Yummy"}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant ! It was great and the service was excellent! There small plates were good and fun to share! There drinks were superb!"}
{"text":"I've been here for both breakfast and dinner now and have had a good experience both times. One thing to note is that there isn't as much seating as you would think, so expect a wait on busy nights with the potential for parking difficulty.  The service overall is great, with helpful, friendly staff and short wait times.  BREAKFAST Great coffee selection from the espresso bar and a well-rounded breakfast menu. I've tried the avocado toast and the breakfast burger which is surprisingly filling. I RARELY leave food left over, especially in burger form, but this one had me beat.  DINNER Great appetizer selection. I had the grilled cheese for dinner, which was delicious, but slightly underwhelming portion-wise.  All around a great place to go with an awesome vibe. Try it out for sure!"}
{"text":"Oh geez... I don't even know where to start with the Covenant. I have now been here four times which would make you think that I love the place. But really, it's just insanely convenient because I live nearby. The food is decent but never great... however, the drinks are outstanding. The staff are also outstanding. I wish the food was as exceptional as the bar and the staff.  Best thing on the menu is the hummus platter appetizer. They roast the veggies and smear the hummus along a board under the vegetables. It's delicious.  Their coffee is excellent if you're a coffee drinker.  The Ambiance is very odd. They've mixed a ton of different interior design motifs which makes the place feel a little overwhelming and confusing.  It's very loud, so beware that it's hard to have a quiet conversation.  If you go, ask to be seated in Gabi's section... she's the best server."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Any time I'm near I stop to grab a bite. The chicken is delicious, their chorizo chili relleno is to die for. Great service, bright upbeat environment, cool atmosphere. 10/10 recommend."}
{"text":"Stoped by today at the official opening. What a wonderful addition to the area!  Fab servers (I forget my great young server's, name but his tie tying skills are mad). Decor, menu, location, staff - all rock.  Parking is easy if it use the big lot west of Trader Joe's (also used for OHSO).  Heading back soon to try some of the menu items.  Happy Hour is 3-6pm and the app and drink specials will rotate.  All smiles here. Update- stopped by again for a happy hour drink which was fine, server wasn't to attentive but I think they are still trying to find their stride...but---it was very warm and humid!  We had one drink and started chatting with another couple but we couldn't stay for a 2nd drink because of the heat.  Hopefully they'll correct this. Also, no apps on happy hour yet."}
{"text":"This place was amazing great atmosphere phenomenal food and excellent service. Karissa was our server and she was excellent and on top of everything. If I go back again I will definitely request her as my server. The manager was friendly and quick to ask how everything was. I would highly recommend this restaurant we were blown away by the freshness and taste of all the courses from appetizer to dessert.  The braised short rib ravioli was extremely flavorful. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So far this place was rockin on opening day! Evidently the neighborhood has been waiting for an establishment of this caliber; I know I have! First off, bring a few bucks cash with you. There is absolutely no parking, but instead free valet so make sure you have a couple bucks for the guy parking your car. Don't be that jerk who parks At Trader Joe's.   At first glance, gorgeous place with no attention to detail spared. Glistening chandeliers, powder blue leather stools all around the rectangular bar and at the many high top banquettes. A few booths and a nice community table complete the seating arrangements. The bar is gorgeous, conducive to socializing and complete with a stunning \"whiskey wall\" as I'd like to call it -- it's a work of art -- and at least four HD TVs, two on either side.  In a nutshell: swanky, trendy, innovative, somewhat pricey, and loud. These are not necessarily negative things in my opinion; just things to know before you go, to prepare yourself. A definite plus: kitchen open til 11pm or later, depending on the day of the week.   Unfortunately for someone like myself who lives for happy hour, Covenant disappoints a bit. Great drink offerings: a few beers for $5, two crafted cocktails at $6, and four high end wines for $7 each. However, there is only one food offering during hh (which appears to change periodically/ daily); when I went it was a bowl of marinated olives for $7. Not a deal. They definitely need some hh food!! The menu, albeit fantastic and very appetizing, is spendy, so for folks like me, hh is something that is lacking. Considering there are at least six restaurants within a mile of here which have great hh, Covenant should step it up. Perhaps they don't feel the need to... that they'll do enough revenue without it, and I get that. I'm merely speaking from a local's pov.    So far that's my only criticism, as I haven't had a meal yet.  The menu is fantastic, including the wine list. Wines btg are pretty expensive compared to other restaurants in the area, but appropriate for this type of establishment. Overall Covenant has a great vibe; I quickly learned from the folks I met at the bar that this will definitely become a new neighborhood hotspot. I look forward to going back. Again, a perk: kitchen open til 11pm."}
{"text":"My first impression of the place was \"this is nicely decorated\".  Classic and modern blended in a very nice way. I must say... I thought it is a retail store from outside. Thank goodness my friend insisted that he thinks it is a restaurant.   Environment - 5 It is beautiful. I love the giant yellow front door especially.  Service - 5 Austin is the man.  He is so cool and friendly.  He provided just the right amount of service.  Food - 5 So good.  My friend got the rib dip sandwich and I got the chicken sandwich. Plus I got a dessert.  Yum yum in my tum tum.   Overall experience - 5 Love it.  It was a nice afternoon meal with a relaxing environment.   I would highly recommend this place.  And please haters out there... Don't complaint about every little thing.  My first job was at a restaurant. People complaint about the most ridiculous and stupidest things on earth.  Get a life or cook your meal at home.  Or just go to McD.    Good job.  Keep it up.  Thanks Austin for being awesome."}
{"text":"We came here on Monday night and had to wait for an hour just to get our appetizer. Then we saw people finishing up their food while we were still waiting on ours, and they came in way after us. The service is horrible and the food is not so good either. Also it's way overpriced for what they offer. Never again."}
{"text":"First time here and I think we found our new hangout spot... bottomless mimosas for brunch and GREAT service from Gabby!!! Small but delicious menu!"}
{"text":"What a beautiful restaurant. Chandeliers, greenery, gorgeous colors, and even TV's! As I walked in a little late for my reservation, I was met with friendliness from the three hostesses standing at the front and I was seated right away. Make reservations, as it is a busy place!  The tables are close together as they attempt to fit everyone into this vibrant, loud restaurant. You can definitely hear the neighboring conversations. We started with the beet and goat cheese salad which was perfect. I found it difficult to decide on my dinner selection but our server gave great recommendations and descriptions and I ordered the short rib for dinner - and it was fabulous.  My dinner mate ordered the salmon and it was cooked perfectly.  Both meals had beautiful presentations. This is a fun lively place that has awesome service. My only complaint is the limiting dessert menu- three choices is not enough and considering Panna cotta is one - well there is just an untapped market for some delicious desserts."}
{"text":"Be sure to bring your wallet for this place. First time here, our fare consisted of hummus board With roasted vegetables cedar plank salmon braised short rib ravioli, and Chefs cheddar Mac. We also had three Lavender mocha coffees to go. It was all very good but the bill came to 100 dollars for 3 people."}
