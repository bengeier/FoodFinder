{"text":"I had bubble tea and mushroom egg soup for a bedtime snack.  It wasn't the best bubble tea I've ever had, but it was good.  The soup was delicious!"}
{"text":"All of their chicken dishes taste the same, too much black pepper.   Waitress did not say thank you for anything, seems she feels its our privilege to be there."}
{"text":"I loved the Hot &Sour soup and the dumplings were top notch. ($5.50 for 12, $9.99 for 24!) and the noodles were great too. I was less impressed with the General Tso chicken; I found the sauce a little goopy and wasn't thrilled with seasoning. I will definitely return for the soup and dumplings.  Update: Went back again and tried the lemon chicken, crispy beef short ribs and beef with black bean sauce on rice noodles, plus some more of those dumplings and all of them were excellent. The ribs were tender on the inside, crisp on the outside and seasoned perfectly. The lemon sauce was tangy without being overly sweetened or goopy.   Inexpensive and tasty."}
