{"text":"This place is a hidden gem for getting delicious bread for cheap! All loafs of bread are only $2 after 6pm. My favourite is their cape seed bread made with whole wheat flour and packed with many grains and seeds. Its's so good! They also have a variety of other breads, rolls and baguettes that look just as good. The reason I am giving it 3 stars is because I am not a real big fan of their desserts. They have a wide variety of cakes and pies, but the once I tried so far did not really stand out. However, I will certainly be coming back for more of their delicious bread."}
{"text":"I used to get the best butter tarts just a few years ago at the The Hot Oven bakery but this past week the tarts I tried were a major disappointment especially at the price of 1.90 for each tart!"}
{"text":"I agree with the first poster. Hot Oven Bakery is not the same as it was when I was growing up! They used to have delicious jam cookies that were large, buttery and full of nuts. They were a favourite of myself and my dad. Now they are sad little cookies with a smear of jam in the middle and no buttery deliciousness. And the price has increased.

Sad to say the upkeep of this location has also gone downhill. During my very last visit years ago there were fruit flies swarming the sweets in the display cases. I pointed it out to the staff but nobody seemed to care. That was the final straw for me, I never went back after that."}
{"text":"What happened to you, Hot Oven????? I grew up with you as a child....you were the stop that my mom and i made whenever we passed by Cloverdale Mall.  When I moved back to Toronto a few years ago, i noticed you were different. not only did you multiply and now exist in the Kingsway and Bloor West Village, but you are also a lot cheaper and of less quality!!!!

So here I am in the Hot Oven bakery today.  I've noticed that the ingredients used in their traditional winners have made the products taste different.  Somebody tipped me off that they changed ownership a few years ago, which is probably when they changed ingredients...you can tell that the stuff they use now is a lot cheaper. For instance, the meat pies have a darker crust (lard in the crust, perhaps???) and the meat is fattier.  Those meat pies were to-die-for in the olden days.  The classic orange chiffon cake is also darker in colour.  Not sure what they are using, but it has also changed a bit in taste......

No longer do they give out free cookies to the kiddies like I remember.  And, today, they had the nerve to CHARGE ME to write \"MELODY\" on a cake.  5 cents per letter. WHA???????????????????  I told the lady at the cashier that i have been coming there for 30 years and they have never charged to write birthday messages on the cake.  She told me \"it is a labour charge\".  WHA????? 30 cents??? Craziness....a great way to tick off your longstanding customers and for what????  A mere few cents? i don't get it.

Oh Old Hot Oven of days past...I miss you!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely not the best bakery in town but it's okay. 

I find that, over the past couple of years, they've been slowly reducing the amount of meat in the meat pies and charging more.  The last steak and mushroom pie we had only had three pieces of meat.  It's unfortunate because the meat pies were really, really good - soft fluffy pastry and very tasty filings.  It's busy there too so I don't understand the stinginess.

I'm tempted to just give it two stars because, last time I was there, this idiot was making my turkey sandwich (they weigh the meat) and didn't put the full amount of turkey on it because she said it \"didn't fit the bread\" - so I'm supposed to pay the full price for half serving?!?  It was painful to see the struggle she went through just to make a sandwich - like it's not rocket science."}
{"text":"Old folks be LOVING this place. Tuesday lunchtime, this place was jam-packed with senior citizens craving some baked goods.

Their gingerbread cookies are some of the best I've eaten. Most of the staff is also really friendly. Other than that, everything is pretty overpriced and decent-tasting. Nothing too special here."}
