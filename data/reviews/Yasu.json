{"text":"My first omakase experience in Toronto. Tons of fresh fish options and they go the extra mile to educate you on what you're eating. Rice was inconsistent with services in terms of texture and mouth feel. Don't miss your reservation. They wont hesitate to charge you for a missed appointment."}
{"text":"I feel like I need to write a review about Yasu because the reviews here really led me astray - I expected way more than what was delivered - if i were really cynical, i would say that people have been paid to write these reviews. Basically, the quality of the sushi and the skills/ professionalism of the sushi chef did not live up to the hype although it wasn't half bad. 

First off the good - 
(1) ambience is nice  - jazzy music - clean environment - establishments with an extensive wine menu 
(2) quality of fish was not bad 
(3) 18 pieces of sushi as well as dessert for $80 was a good deal. 

the bad -
(1) discrimination from chef - who served the three people who spoke to him in japanese \"better\" pieces - by this i mean for instance with the tamago - they had the ends cut off - while with ours - he did not cut off the ends - NOT ACCEPTABLE - this kind of practice passable for an average sushi restaurant
(2) after the omakase service, the sushi chef started cutting up fish for the next service (we had gone for the first service) and his skills he showed off really left much to be desired. very unimpressive. 
(3) the fish quality although ok was not great 
(4) the omakase is actually being served only by two sushi chefs for the entire restaurant which seats about 14 people so be aware of that - so you do have to wait for your \"fresh\" piece of sushi ....

Overall - this is average sushi in an ok setting - to equate it with high end or even above averages places in Tokyo's Fish Market, Tokyo or New York is highly deceptive."}
{"text":"You might ask - who the hell pays $80 for sushi? I mean, I could probably go to Sushi on Bloor and get one of those ridiculous boats with enough sushi to feed some unfortunate village and still have enough money left over to do god knows what one does after a boat load of sushi. HOWEVER, if you agree that there's possibly more to Japanese food than all-you-can-eat California rolls and endless slabs of salmon, then read on:

As you probably know, dinner at Yasu is a $80 fixed price affair. I'm pretty sure there were 17 pieces or something like that, but I was too busy having a food-gasm to keep track. The restaurant is modern and clean if somewhat sterile. But you aren't coming here for the decor or ambiance. Service was efficient. There are only twelve seats, 10 at the sushi bar and a two seater at a table. I would avoid the table. Half the joy is watching Yasu prepare each of the pieces with the instruments of his trade. As for the food, the type of pieces that are served fluctuates. On my visit, the tuna was delightful, particularly the fatty tuna (otaro). The scallop were fresh tasting, with just the right amount of blow torching. My other highlights was the monk fish foie gras, sardine, and mackerel pieces.

Overall, I think Yasu is definitely worth the visit. The question will be if they can maintain their quality going forward. The place has recently generated some positive press and interest will start to increase...I hope they can keep it up for the next time I come back."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic sushi. The sushi is served in ascending order of flavor, with white fish at the beginning building to those with darker, stronger flavor. I was disappointed with the amount of soy sauce and wasabi applied to the earlier white fish nigiri, as these condiments masked the subtler flavors of the fish. However, the chef asks you about any allergies or taste preferences at the beginning of the meal, so if I returned I might ask for a little less (assuming he remembers-- he had to be reminded about another patron's scallop allergy, whoops). The best and most memorable sushi were those with stronger flavors-- the mackerel with ginger, and the bluefin toro with freshly grated wasabi root were superb.

The service is very attentive and friendly, and the decor is nice, but the ambiance is lacking-- too-loud soft rock was played through the meal, which was distracting and made it hard to hear the chef at times and especially the soft-spoken waitress. There was also a strong smell of lemony cleanser (?-- it smelled like the hot towels from the beginning) that persisted through the entire meal that was quite unpleasant.

Overall, the food is excellent but I think that a quieter atmosphere and more appreciation of the subtleties of the fish are needed to make Yasu worth the price tag."}
{"text":"Love this place! The fish was really fresh and everything was amazing. The service was great really recommend the sushi bar so you can see the sushi chef work their magic!"}
{"text":"Pros: decent ingredients (but not mind blowing - have your expectations in check). Sake pairing was good but again, $50 for 5 small shots -  pricy.

Cons: 

I noticed one of the chef's nail is black and used the same wiping towl for the knife, surface and handing - it ruined the experience 

When the 18 pieces were done, the chef asked if anyone wanted more without telling us they are gonna charge us for the extra - feeling fooled. 

In all, won't go back and doesn't worth the $300 bill and one month wait on reservation."}
{"text":"For straight up sushi this is as good as it gets. Excellent, fresh fish from all over the world and for a reasonable price as well ($80 for 18 pieces of sushi only). Chef Yasu was very nice and explains each piece of sushi and what's on it after a little prompting. Here's what we had:
Sea bass from Greece 
Fluke from Boston
Scallop with Himalaya rock salt from Hokkaido Japan
Horse mackerel from Portugal
Monk fish liver from Boston
Amber jack from Japan
Spot prawn from Vancouver Island (head and tail)
Sea breem from Greece 
Salmon roe fresh yuzu
Stripe jack from Southern Japan (very rare)
Tuna, filet, y toro o toro from Mexico
Golden eye snapper from Portugal
Mackerel with pickled daikon from Norway
See eel handroll with cucumber
Tamago (unreal)

I think some of the highlights were definitely the spot prawns which are seasonal, you suck the juice out of the head while still moving (not for the squeamish) and then eat the tail on rice. The Stripe jack from southern Japan was amazing and I've never seen it before in Toronto. The Golden snapper and the horse mackerel were both excellent. The tuna from Mexico was also excellent. The Hokkaido scallop was unreal as well, very sweet and slightly briny in taste but unlike any scallop I've tasted before.

For $80 this is by no means a \"deal\" but hey, you're getting some of the best fish from around the world. The Kirin beer from Japan was also delicious as others have noted.

For straight up sushi I would strongly recommend this place for both the fish and the experience of watching a true master at work in Chef Yasu."}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed the omakase experience set by Yasu. I recently came back from Japan and can say that the quality of sushi served here was either on par and even better than some sushi I had at the Tsukiji fish market. Some of the sushi in the 18 piece dinner definitely gave me a \"wow.\" All the pieces melt into your mouth as sushi is supposed to, but what stood out for me out of all the pieces was the Uni. I was never a fan of Uni due to it's plain, bitter taste until I tasted Yasu's which was full of flavour. Yasu's service was as expected with the food, good. Chefs were also friendly and seemed to enjoy interacting with customers. I will definitely come back next year."}
{"text":"This is a late review. I went to Yasu in September 2015. I would give this place a 4 when compared to sushi restaurants in other cities, but given that we are in Toronto, it's definitely a 5. It's a small and cosy place with friendly staff. The fish was fresh and of high quality. The omakase included 16 pieces of various sushi, 1 maki and 1 handroll. Try to get a seat at the bar; watching the chefs do their thing was pretty fun."}
{"text":"Yasu is a must-try sushi experience in Toronto. $80 for an 18 pc omakase is WELL worth the price. I would eat it twice in one night but it is surprisingly satiating. Make reservations as it is usually booked a month or two solid but if you book thru OpenTable, you can sign up for notifications in case of a cancellation. And get a bar seat. We had the best seats in the house right in front of executive chef and itamae Yasuhisa Ouchi who served us with meticulous care and incredible skill. The whole night is a performance. Fresh ingredients that melt in your mouth. Both the chefs and servers are very attentive, which is natural considering there are pretty much 10 patrons at a time. 5/5 would eat again and again and again."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant after reading a review on the Toronto Star. 

I've tried other omakase restaurants in the GTA (Kanji) and in Japan. I must say the quality of the fish is on par. You get approximately 18 pieces of nigri throughout the evening with a desert at the end. You get to watch the chef (or rather Chefs as there is one chef per six diners) prepare your meal. The chef then places the nigri in front of you as you finish it. 

Green tea is included and like others have commented, the service is excellent. 

*** BEWARE *** At the last course, the chef will tell you that you can order one more piece. However, this is not free and is NOT included in the $80 fee. Each additional piece cost $10 EACH.

Update: had a slight tummy upset after eating here. Not sure what to make of it..."}
{"text":"It took about a month to find an appropriate time for a our reservation for two....
however, it was so worth it.

12 seat Sushi restaurant. Two chefs working in unison. Reminded both my wife and me of our sushi dinners in Tokyo.

Fish was delicious. Fresh and flavourful, Some from Japan, such as the big eye snapper, but the fish from Greece (ie Sea Bass) was also awesome.

First time for cod sperm sack (from Japan) and trust me, it's very delicious... don't worry!! it's good.

very friendly staff were extremely attentive. 

$80 per person and we had a 15 course Omakase menu... all nigiri except for a hand roll.

Fresh wasabi! loved that too. Rice, perfectly seasoned and slightly warm (as it should be!!)

Overall I would give it 6/5 if I could.

This is a must try if you enjoy sushi."}
{"text":"I have been to Yasu several times.
Each Occasion was a wondrous event indeed.
from the moment I sat down till the final course I was mesmerized.
The chef is a virtuoso, who prepares each course by hand one by one, part of the experience is just watching him prepare each piece, and the excitement you feel as he places it on your plate.

At the price of $80 dollars, it is literally a steal. I do not think many restaurants in the GTA can give you a similar experience at that price point.

This restaurant is one of a Kind"}
{"text":"Let's exclude omakase experiences in Japan for a second. If so, this is truly a firm 5/5. Every bite delicious, even the fish with stronger fishy flavor tasted more sophisticated, more delicious. Also, their uni is perfect and of excellent quality. No bitterness at all. Service also top notch. Only note.. Please don't embarrass yourself by asking for wasabi like the two uncultured couples beside us.. They will humour you but, smh..."}
{"text":"Yasu has been getting quite a bit of attention in the last year or so making onto EnRoute's Best New Restaurants in 2015.  Reviews here have also been generally positive.  

So recently decided to make a reservation and see what the fuss is all about.  2 seatings a night and for the 8:30pm seating, it was completely full, 11 at the bar and 2 more by the window.  2 chefs took care of us, dividing us between them.  

18 pieces in all plus dessert.  The fish variety comes from all over the world, Mexico, Peru, Vancouver, Boston, Norway and of course Japan.  The type of fish also changes but there does seem to be a staple of fish that they like to serve or at least be able to get a hold of in the quality and quantity that they need.  We had fluke, bluefin tuna from lean to fatty, scallop, sweet shrimp, mackerel, uni (sea urchin), monkfish liver, lightly smoked bonito, salmon roe, yellowtale, snow crab, sea bass, sea eel,  and snapper.  So definitely no shortage of variety.  

We sat right in the middle of the bar table and was able to see both chefs at work which was a really nice treat.  I would definitely recommend getting a bar seat rather than the 2 seats by the window.  There were fish that didn't make too much of an impact but I really enjoyed the mackerel, medium tuna, sweet shrimp, eel, scallop, bonito and even the uni and I'm usually not a fan finding it a bit too strong for my liking but the one from Vancouver I found quite creamy and nice.  Everything was made with care and placed in front of us one piece at a time.  The attention to detail was evident and nice to see.  

Negatives?  Not much I would say.  The portions if I had to be critical were a bit thin.  No one would ever mistaken Yasu for an all you can eat sushi restaurant or should it ever be.  It is aiming for Kaji, more focused than Zen.  I think it bodes well for Toronto that Yasu can do well in the city and is getting the recognition that it has.  It means we have more choice than salmon, tuna and some nondescript white fish.  Don't even get me started on the Dragon Rolls."}
{"text":"My experience with YASU was very disappointing. After reading multiple reviews for this restaurant I finally decided to make a reservation.  The restaurant is quite over rated.  The sushi was good (not excellent) and in my opinion not worth the price. The wait staff did a good job explaining where the seafood came from. Tip - do not sit by the table next to the window since you will be the last to be served. Unfortunately  I give YASU 3.5 out of 5."}
{"text":"I'm torn between two and three stars.

My partner and I have been lucky enough to have enjoyed experiences with some of the most highly regarded sushi chefs in Tokyo, and we have our favourites in New York as well. This is Toronto, and the omakase at Yasu is only $80 CAD, so it would be unfair to make direct comparisons. Even still, I was pretty disappointed.

In detail: the uni was probably the weakest I've ever had, the monkfish liver was a letdown. The toro was good, the hamachi was good, the tamago was well made, I enjoyed the scallop. Most of the rest were average. I also enjoyed the sake, although I don't know enough about sake to offer an educated opinion here.

I understand that, especially with the weak Canadian dollar, Yasu simply can't offer top-end products without raising the price a lot -- and even though I wasn't blown away by any of the pieces we were given, I do still think the value is there. The bigger problem with Yasu, though, is with the service.

First of all, do not expect traditional Japanese-style service. You won't get a hot towel (which also means that you will not be able to eat the sushi with your hands, if that is what you prefer). Each chef shares the rice, so the flow is paced expediently, not customized after careful observation on the part of the chef (the way it should be with sushi). And as someone else on Yelp observed, the progression wasn't very elegant - it felt a bit random.

I made our reservation for my partner's birthday, and every other sushi restaurant we've been to for birthdays or anniversaries -- including Kaji in Toronto-- has acknowledged the occasion in some way (not Yasu). Far worse, though: I'd been in touch via email to ask if we could be seated opposite chef Yasu. I was told that they would 'try' to seat us by Yasu 'if possible.' This is the first time I've ever heard a response like that from a sushi restaurant. If those seats were already booked, then communicate that, but if not, why not confirm the request?  

Well, when we arrived, another couple got there just before and us and were asked to choose their seats from what was left, so it became obvious that the service at Yasu does not pre-book individual seats. The couple ended up choosing spots at the far end of the bar (not where Yasu works). But it turned out that Yasu wasn't even in that night anyway. A sushi restaurant that operates without the chef? This normally doesn't happen, and shouldn't. But at the very least, I would have been so grateful if that were communicated to me when I sent the initial email. If I had known that he would not be in that night, I would not have made the reservation. 

This might sound overly picky, but I mean one of the things you expect from sushi restaurants (and any high-end Japanese restaurant) is an impressive level of service, and even in Toronto there are other places that deliver on this (Hashimoto, but also Yunaghi, Kaji, and Zen have proper service). Why, when you maybe can't offer clients the very best product, wouldn't you optimize the service?

All in all, I'm so disappointed. Sushi is about subtlety and detail. Lacking this, what's the point? I was really looking forward to finally having a regular sushi place in Toronto. I'm not sure if their location alone will be enough to save Yasu once all the hype dies down."}
{"text":"I highly recommend Yasu if you are looking for really good sushi. You must get omakase for $80, but have the option to continue buying anything you liked after. We get 18 pieces + dessert (sesame ice cream) and I got 4 additional orders. 

The restaurant is a very small (seats ~12) cozy place. The design is simple and the focus really becomes about the chefs and the food. 

All pieces we got were consistently good. I think this was a good contrast from other omakase experiences I've had where many were good, some were great, and others we okay. I found I really liked everything, but wasn't particularly blown away by anything either. Overall, a very enjoyable meal with every item being a solid 9/10. What I find Yasu does better than most other places I've been to, is achieve really good balance.  I found the pairings of garnishes (grated daikon, picked daikon, grated ginger and garlic, yuzu zest, etc.) with the neta really well thought out and did a great job complementing and balancing out the taste. Never was it over-powered or out of place.

Nothing is ever perfect and so my only real gripe with Yasu was that the service can be improved. Not that it is bad, I just find that other restaurants at this price has more on-point service. The servers are friendly and informative, but they are not really good at keeping customer's tea hot/full. I saw that everyone with tea had to request a refill in order to get one. Sake and beer are quickly dealt with at the initiative of the servers, but tea was not. Attention to detail would add a lot for the overall experience. Something like clearing out the paper that is used to hold together the chopsticks would be an improvement since the counter top has a simple but clean look, but then we have some random paper scraps laying around that detracts from it all. 

These issues aren't really a big deal for me, and certainly not a deal breaker. It's just me trying to be picky. The experience really was wonderful and I am already eagerly planning my next meal here. I just wish it was easier to reserve on shorter notice since I'm sure there'll often be times when I'm craving Yasu, but would have to wait weeks :("}
{"text":"I was blessed to have eaten at both Zen and Yasu this week and my criticisms of Yasu's rice still remains. It's harder and more densely packed when compared to Zen's rice but there are things at Yasu that you are unable to eat at Zen. That being the: tamago yaki, ankimo and shirako (when they have it). I would still recommend trying Yasu at least once for the experience but in my humble opinion the best sushi in Toronto is from Zen. Make sure to reserve seats at the sushi bar for the omakase as they apply the soy sauce for you and each piece comes one at time!"}
{"text":"It is definitely over priced for what you are getting.  You get to enjoy only tiny bit of the fish but lots of rice. I would expect Sashimi instead of Sushi.
For that my rating is low."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been here a couple of times now and it's been a treat every time. Yasu was my very first omakase experience and it definitely set the tone for every other omakase/sushi place I've gone to afterwards. This is the place I recommend to all of my friends who are either visiting Toronto or want to try higher end sushi. I love that the fish is seasonal to ensure the freshest fish possible and also allows you to have something new every time you go! I also find that this place has the most exotic fish flown in (e.g. a lot of them are from Japan, Boston, BC for the uni, etc.) which is really neat. I will also happily note that I've been to Japan and the quality and flavour of Yasu is definitely up there. The service is great and I highly recommend sitting at the bar rather than at the table to get the full experience. Thanks for a wonderful time and I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience here. The fish was extremely fresh, the service was spot on and the atmosphere was very sophisticated. Each delicate piece of sushi was made with such thought and precision. The meal was not cheap, but you pay for what you get.  I feel we truly experienced the art of sushi at Yasu! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Sushi is what YASU is all about. 

Came here with a good friend and enjoyed every last bite of it. 

Guess i can admit i was a bit nervous-- cuz really a restaurant that only seats 10 persons can make one go \"hmmmm ...\" sometimes.  Then u start imagining it's too bourgeois ..or something. whatever. 

So, we got there. greeted. and sat at the counter.  In front of me was a gigantic salmon head surrounded by big blocks of ice; it continued to be there throughout dinner. 

The chef asked if there were any food allergies, which was nice cuz i can't eat shellfish and a dish was crab sushi. real crab- not fake crab. 

It's a set menu. To be honest i lost count after like fourth dish. first dish came, delicious. second --super. third-- amaze balls, so and so forth.  At the end, my friend and i were stuffed. Didn't think small sushi would be so filling. Never under estimate the power of sushi.

The place is clean, and cozy. The atmosphere was nice, and the staff were friendly. The chefs were engaging and telling the customers where the fishes are from, which was pretty educational. 

YASU turned out to be a very nice and authentic sushi house, in my opinion.  I don't say authentic very often when it comes to restaurant.  
I have never had anything like it. It was truly a great experience. Worth the money. 

I'd love to give it 5 stars but --- that's only if it was my grandmother's cooking :)

GO TO YASU"}
{"text":"High quality sushi and overall great experience. Sushi chefs and quality aren't at Kaji-san level but for the opportunity to order strictly omakase sushi its worth going."}
{"text":"Before I review the restaurant, I'd like to note about some patrons I witnessed here. I really hope that people understand there is expected manner at restaurants. Some were constantly looking at their smart phone, texting, watching video as they wait at the sushi bar table. This is not a drinking bar. The chefs at this restaurant serve each sushi in front of you each time, sometimes directly hand it to you, explaining the type and origin of the fish. And they take three days to prepare that dish, including the fish selection and planning. If you are busy with your phone, you can't have that important conversation with the chef, which by the way is PART of the sushi course, and to be enjoyed. Please have a good manner and respect the chef. Just because you are paying money doesn't mean you don't have to respect them.

That being said, it seemed like the chefs were completely aware of such patrons and they were deliberately excluded from such conversations ;)

OK, enough of bending about other rude patrons...
The sushi fish is absolutely fresh. The shrimp head was still moving when I attempted to eat (it's optional in case you are wondering). What amazed me most was the egg. It is beautiful and smooth, unbelievably tasty. There are three chefs in total. It seems like one chef is in charge of 6 people. Depending on where you are seated you get different chef designated to you.
The only improvement I'd like to request will be the dessert. It's a sushi bar. I don't expect much for dessert. But a little better quality ice cream may be nicer :)"}
{"text":"Having dined at several Michelin starred sushi restaurants in Tokyo, I was delightfully surprised at the meal I had at Yasu. The sushi was very fresh, the presentation was superb and quantity was just right. And relatively speaking, $80 was quite reasonable for this grade of a sushi restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"This was one of the best sushi experiences we've ever had. Each serving was just as good as the last. We did not sit at the bar and regretted it. We could still see the sushi prep from our table but for the full experience - sit at the bar! 
We added the sashimi plate to start which was an extra $25 each but worth it. 
The service was excellent. We asked our server for a saki recommendation and wanted something a bit sweet. Her suggestion was spot on but just to be sure, she also brought us a sample of another option to try. She explained each dish and told us where each piece of fish was from. 
I would rate each dish a 5/5 but the the monkfish liver was the absolute best, it was so smooth and creamy - definitely exceeded our expectations.
The green tea ice cream served at the end was the only disappointment. It left very little to be desired but by that time we were too full to really care."}
{"text":"Yasu was one of the best culinary experiences of my life.

It's a tiny sushi bar place on Harbord Street, in a converted house. I missed it a few times while driving by. It sits around 10 people around the sushi bar with 2 additional people at a small table. I would highly recommend showing up on time to get a sushi bar spot as seeing the sushi made in front of you is a big part of the experience. 

They do only two sittings a night, omakase style, meaning a chef's choice for $80 per person, coordinated by 2 chefs. 

Before I walked in, I thought I knew good sushi, but I was absolutely blown away by Yasu. The quality of the fresh fish shines through and the sushi rice was the best I've ever had. 

I don't even have pictures of the food because for two straight hours I just sat down and ate. I'll definitely be returning and would highly recommend for anyone in Toronto."}
{"text":"Fresh fish, impeccable service, one amazing experience! Words, pictures and videos really don't do it justice. Try it for yourself!

Full details of my visits are here on my blog: http://jade-eats.weebly.com/blog/yasu-55"}
{"text":"This may very well be the best sushi I've had in Toronto. The chef serves you piece by piece and you watch him prepare everything right in front of you. All the ingredients are fresh and from around the world. We had fish from Vancouver, Boston, Alaska, Mexico, Spain, Portugal, Greece and of course Japan.

For $80 you get 18 pieces of sushi carefully crafted right in front of you (and a dessert at the end). The chef tells you what kind of fish you are eating and where it's from. Amazing food and great service. We asked for recommendation for a sweet sake and what we got was perfect. 

If you are a sushi purist, I highly recommend this place. Sushi doesn't get any better than this. For those of us who can't make it to Jiro in Japan, this might be the next best thing.

Would definitely come back here for more!"}
{"text":"We've been to Yasu twice over the past year and this place is a consistent 5 *!  IMO, Sushi Kaji still ranks #1 for an authentic omakase experience.  But you really can't go wrong with Yasu's @ a mere $80 per person!

Zen Japanese Restaurant used to be our #2.  But now that it has upgraded its location (to 7634 Woodbine Avenue in Markham) with upscale décor and higher prices, Yasu has definitely won us over!

2 seatings on Wed and Thu.  3 seatings from Fri to Sun. Closed Mon and Tue.  Book early or be prepared to go on their waiting list.  You'll only have 15 mins to respond to a wait list opening before it goes to somebody else.

Chef Yasu brings in fresh fish from all over the world!  Returning from Hokkaido in July, I was craving for Japanese uni.  We were so thrilled to see Hokkaido uni being part of their omakase menu here!  Other sushi restos including Zen, Hiro and Sushi Bar Sushiya tend to serve B.C. uni.  If you're as picky as me, you'll most likely prefer Hokkaido ones too - having more of a delicate texture and absolutely no after taste!  So go now, before the season ends!"}
{"text":"If I could I would give Yasu a 4.5/5. Hands down one of my favourite sushi places in town. I've had omakase style sushi at both Kaji and Zen and found Yasu to be more traditional in their presentation and choice of sushi (very similar to Zen). Their selection was amazing and I liked the order that they delivered their sushi in. It starts off with a piece that has a light and clear flavour to it, then they give you something with stronger, then light again, etc. all the way until dessert (a ginger ice-cream with candied ginger pieces in it). Just based off of the food, the experience would have been 5/5.

The only minor (and I really do mean minor) flaw was that the wait staff took a bit longer to attend to us than expected. They were very quick to give me water when I initially sat down and explained the menu well but it took them a while to come back when we wanted to order our drinks. I also asked the chef if he could put slightly less wasabi in my sushi and I noticed that he would kind of forget to do that sometimes. But he was super friendly and even joked around with me afterwards when we were ordering extra pieces.

Would 100% come back again. It is expensive ($80 for 18 pieces) but definitely worth it for special occasions."}
{"text":"Service was great, however you can't eat the server. Sushi was ok, nothing spectacular. I've had better at JaBistro and Kaji. Try to book a bar seat if you can, we sat at the table and noticed some strange things about the difference in quality which I'll highlight below.

The 3 piece we had consisting of regular tuna, light fat tuna, and fatty tuna belly was cut very poorly compared to some of the diners at the bar. The sizes were uneven and my friend had a piece that seems like it was cut and then ripped off the steak. Almost as if a child had cut the piece off. All could've been ignored if the quality was there.

Also, the Uni sushi we had consisted of 1 piece of uni split into 2 for the both of us. It was no longer a speculation after the 2 pieces were joined back together to form the original piece, a fun little project we worked on. Needless to say, this Uni sushi was 90% rice and 10% uni, leaving the rice massively exposed and nothing like the photos posted on here, which took me by surprise considering the price tag on this place. Not to our surprise we noticed our fellow bar dinners received generous pieces while we pretty much ate plain rice for this course.

So once again I must stress the importance of booking a bar seat when visiting as it seems like the chefs in the establishment differs in skill and standard."}
{"text":"Highly recommended to all sushi lovers!!!! Excellent service extremely high quality!!! Quite of pleasanton satisfying experience!!!!"}
{"text":"Yasu is on par with the top notch sushi restaurants in Tokyo.  It is expensive by Toronto standard but the same meal in Japan could easily cost double or more.

Other reviews have gone in depth to describe the food in great detail and thus it's hard for me to add much value in that regard.  However, a relative ranking should help highlight the food quality.

Yasu is a hair better than Shiro's in Seattle, which is head by a chef who is an apprentice of Jiro Ono of Dreams of Sushi fame.  That's how good Yasu is."}
{"text":"The food is really good and sashimi is really fresh. The Saki drinks are pricy but worth to get the wine paring with 5 shots glasses of different Saki for $65. Good place to go for date."}
{"text":"Amazing experience.  A seat at the bar is a must to watch the show.  I went over and above the standard 18 pieces, ordering and additional three of my favourites for an additional cost of about $6 each.  Overall, a very serene and relaxing meal.  List of fish seems pretty static lately, but as far as I recall (not necessarily in order):
- Striped jack 
- Red snapper (certainly not your garden variety stuff from your local take out sushi)
- Sea eel 
- Monkfish liver
- Cod testes
- Salmon Roe hand roll
- Bluefin Tuna x 3 (lean, fatty, extra fatty)
- Uni (urchin) x 2 (east coast from Boston/west coast from Vancouver)
- Seared shimp
- Scallop
- Hay smoked mackerel

{"text":"Worth every wallet injury. I expected good food, but I didn't know it was going to be so fun. The chefs made the atmosphere great and it was a UNIQUE dining experience. We had not just great sushi, but also a great time. This is a charming spot, unlike the typical seriousness that gathers in a sushi omakase.  The fishes were top notch and flavoring was simple but on point and the sequence they came in was well designed. Had shirako for the first time and it wasn't all that scary. The tamago on the house though was HEAVEN! Will be going back soon, perhaps to experience some Spring season fish."}
{"text":"I think basically everything has been said about Yasu, it was just incredible. The freshest fish that I've ever tasted, the most amazing chefs, attentive service. Sit.at.the.bar.people. We left full, drunk, satisfied and I think this ruined all other sushi for me because I've tasted what it could be like and literally, nothing lives up to this quality. 

This place is just wow, go, go, go."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Standouts included some amazing torched scallops, the toro, mackerel with a sliver of pickled daikon, and some totally sublime uni from Hokkaido. The hostess was charming, and the chef was very accommodating - he asked folks about allergies and preferences off the bat, and watching him work was a blast. Pacing was great, and the atmosphere was very relaxed. Our seating wasn't full, but I can't imagine that being the case for much longer. If you like sushi, check it out!"}
{"text":"The omakase was PERFECT. Oh goodness, just thinking back to the sheer perfection of it all makes me salivate. It is $100 meal (tip and tax included) for 18 pieces of sushi + dessert. The fish selection is constantly changing, and it is chefs choice, based on availability. 

This was our line-up: 
Sea Bass
Fluke /(Suzuki) - My favorite :)
Hokkaido scallop
Spot shrimp
Type of yellowtail (kanpachi) amberjack
Lean tuna and medium fatty tuna (Chu toro)
Sardine from Portugal
Salmon roe
Stripe jack (shimachi)
Snow crab
Horse mackerel
Golden ice snapper
Smoked bonito
Monkfish foie gois
Mackerel with pickled dicon radish
Sea eel hand roll ( anago)
Tamago (egg) - SO GOOD.

Dessert: chocolate panna cotta or ginger ice cream. The only thing that I think they could improve on is dessert. They were both overly sweet. The chocolate panna cotta was better, if I had to choose one. 

The service is amazing. Your water glass is never empty, and your ginger stash is promptly replenished by Chef Yasu. There are two chefs, and we were lucky to have Chef Yasu as you can tell that he was a bit more skilled and knowledgeable than the other chef. You can have sake pairing for additional fees. This is definitely a must-try!"}
{"text":"First omakase experience and it did not disappoint. First of all, we had one sushi chef taking care of our party of 5 plus 2 do it felt extremely personal and exclusive. The speed and pacing was also perfect, and the selection was pristine. Absolutely recommend for the reasonable price and fantastic experience."}
{"text":"Don't eat here unless you're serious about sushi.  If your idea of sushi is a california roll; if you make a thick greeny-brown paste of wasabi and soya sauce; if the words \"all you can eat\" excite you, this is not the place for you.  

However, if you like fresh sushi, prepared with pride and skill, served over the course of an hour and a half, then this is like home.

We went for Omakase last night and spent an enjoyable two hours savoring fresh seafood caught from all over the world.  Over the course of the meal there was something like 13 pieces each served in it's own fashion.  Some had lime shavings, others wasabi and sho-yu, and others came with thinly sliced pickled daikon radish.  

The flavours and textures were complex and at times very subtle yet so delicious it makes it difficult to remember to slow down and enjoy the flavor.

The bill for two, including tax, tip and half a bottle of sake was $230.  Which, believe it or not, is very reasonable for sushi of this caliber."}
{"text":"We went for my birthday and I had high expectations because I've heard so many great things.

However, the experience was rather disappointing. It was  a tasting menu of different sushi with different kinds of fish, not a lot of variety, or at least I didn't expect it would just be 18 pieces of sushi...

Would not go back because I like variety a lot!"}
{"text":"My husband and I chose this restaurant as our day-after-our-wedding splurge. Wow...were we impressed! The whole experience is top class. We were fortunate to sit at the sushi bar and watch a master at work! You don't think you'll be full but because of how perfectly spaced the pieces are presented and how mesmerizing the prep was, you realize you're happily satisfied by the end of the 1.5-2hr experience. We tried fish we never could have got at an ayce and could taste the freshness and quality! I recently booked my parents to have their anniversary here and the staff is so helpful and accommodating. Thank you for setting up such a great place in TO!"}
{"text":"A wonderful place where they serve you a traditional omakase sushi dinner. The attention to detail in the service, presentation and the freshness of the food is as authentic as the high end sushi restaurants in Japan.  

The fish, as everyone has noted, is flown in from around the world.  The spot prawns from Alaska were so frisky, they almost didn't stay on the chef's cutting board as he prepped them.  

The restaurant is delightfully small making it seem like you are being catered to at your own private table.  

Remember to make a reservation and ENJOY!"}
{"text":"If you always thought tomago (egg sushi) was the worst sushi of them all that's because you haven't had good tomago. Yasu will enlighten your taste buds. Not only was everything delicious but it was the little touches I noticed that elevated the experience, in each dish but also in the service and that's really what the price tag reflects. Don't settle for anything less!"}
{"text":"Excellent.  We loved it so much we went back for a second time.  What a wonderful meal!  And the special menu by Chef Yasu was even better than the regular menu.  Worth every penny!  Looking forward to going back next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Consistently great Sushi that won't break the bank. Hard to find better value for money for the Omakase here."}
{"text":"Amazing little place, limited seating only 14 people at a time. Make a reservation if you are coming.  This is the real deal, no sushi will be good enough after this one"}
{"text":"Best place next to sushi kaji on queensway 
However this is 10x harder to book due to the size or restaurant 
Expect to wait a month if u want a weekend or prime time"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and didn't dare to post any reviews until I've been here at least twice because sushi places in Toronto always disappoints me on my second visit.

I had a moment of disbelief that Toronto can get this kind of quality of sushi. If you yearn for Sushi Nakazawa in NYC(Jiro's Disciple), this is as close as you can get to that in Toronto.

It's a bit silly to compare this with Sushi Kaji because the two serves a completely different kind of japanese cuisine. Sushi Kaji serves kaiseki style meal. Yasu, on the other hand, serves just straight up sushi. The chef fold the sushi in front of you and serves it one by one. This is the kind of thing you'd expect from real sushi restaurants in Japan, not the kaiten sushi(conveyor belt sushi) or AYCE chinese sushi.

Service is typical of real japanese restaurants, which are run and owned by japanese. The kind of service where your server offers hot towel before meal with both hand and so on.

The fish here depends on what's on season. On my second visit, at the end of the meal, the waitress let us know that they have a special hokkaido uni and shirako from japan. Always get their special! The hokkaido uni is a completely different beast from the BC uni that were served earlier. BC uni has this bitter after taste to it, while the hokkaido ones are extremely buttery with a yolk-like after taste. Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Yes. I love sushi. I love to eat raw fish. But how you prepare that little piece of raw fish with rice makes a huge difference. 
During my spontaneous Canadian trip, my husband made a reservation at Yasu for our exceptional sushi experience while we were in Toronto. 
It was very small restaurant but modern set up in downtown Toronto. Walk ins are not recommended. From other reviews, it seems like you need to at least call 2 weeks in advance to get a reservation. 
12 seats in sushi bar and 1 small table for 2 people. Our seating was at 5pm. After everybody got seated, 2 sushi chefs came out. We were so lucky to  have chef Yasu make our sushi. Whatever he prepared was so good. Melted in our mouths. We didn't need any soy sauce as Chef Yasu brushed soy sauce on top of our sushi.  
If you are ever in the greater Toronto area you must try Yasu."}
{"text":"This is my first sushi-only omakase experience and I have to say that I really enjoyed it.  Watching the sushi chef's handle the sushi and present it so beautifully made the experience very special.

Each bite was delicious and I can't wait to go back.

Favourites were the sockeye salmon, sardine, mackerel, bonito and the sesame ice cream at the end - what an amazing dinner!"}
{"text":"I went here as my birthday dinner and I was blown away. It's a small but intimate experience given the omakase style serving. Having been to Zen and heard the reputation of this place I had high expectations. I must admit that the starting pieces were not too impressive but I guess the chef was brewing the element of surprise which worked out well. There were a few memorable mind blowing moments in the middle and my taste buds were spoiled to a new level. 

Needless to say the ingredients are superbly fresh and I think it would be safe to call them exotic. I don't know most of the fish I am eating but they are surely delicious. The monkfish was memorable both in the texture and its ... ugliness... I somehow made the association with ugly animals taste better. Back to the food. I really like how the chef pairs the pieces such as the 3 tuna pieces (lean, medium and fat) you can compare the different cuts in one setting which is a true unique experience. The medium was my favourite. It was extremely rich and melts in your mouth. Another worthy mention was the Uni. It's packed with flavour and allowed me to understand how high quality Uni tastes like or for the matter, how good ingredients should taste. 

The sensory experience is superb. I can't say the same about the service. The servers are a little clumsy and it leaves me in awe about how you get confused with the orders when there are only 13 patrons.  The decor was nothing fancy. It was rather bare and minimalistic. Despite the little drawbacks I still highly recommend this place since it offers an experience that is well worth the admission."}
{"text":"Food: 9.5/10
Atmosphere: 8/10 
Service: 9/10
Overall experience: 9/10

All the other reviews cover the reasons to go here, but I'll quickly recap:

- great, unique experience for somebody who loves Japanese food. If you've already done the izakaya thing, and are tired of eating sub-par sushi - this is your place. 
- service is great
- food is ultra fresh. Again, going back to the experience part, it's nice to be served each piece at a time so you can really enjoy and savour the flavour

Bonus for me - they have the Mio sparkling sake that I love!

THE BOTTOM LINE: the freshest of sushi, and a unique dining experience overall!"}
{"text":"My all time favorite Japanese restaurant in Toronto! Parking might be a pain, and it could have been raining last night, but that won't deter me from coming! 

The food is a delightful surprise everytime. My last July visit didn't have the seasonal items that were available during the spring. Items like shirako, Sakura shrimp, and the fairy squid. All so delicious!! 

Skirako, basically fish testicles, have a very interesting texture, almost like egg white but softer. The taste is slightly savourary with a light hint of what I could only describe as \"liver-y\". This delicate may only be for the adventurous, try it with an open mind! 

Highly recommend getting the premium sashimi platter. The Hokkaido uni that's part of the platter is much more premium than the BC uni that is part of the sushi. Excellent uni, like Hokkaido, does not smell or taste like a dirty diaper! :) The ones at yasu are sweet and refreshing. 

Service is very attentive here. They are very on time. Buffer in two hours exactly for this meal."}
{"text":"I made a reservation at Yasu a month in advance for dinner on a Sunday night. They're fully booked all the time, and only open reservations 30 days prior to the reservation date. 

When I got to the restaurant, there were a couple of other guests waiting around at the front. Nobody was seated yet at the empty seats, and I'm assuming they wanted to wait for everyone to arrive before starting the dinner service? Because of this, the whole meal felt like a group dinner with a bunch of random strangers. 

For $80 per person, you're served around 18 pieces of sushi. Again, everyone was served the same thing at the same time. The work was divided up between three chefs, and all three shared one rice bowl, and had to wait for one another to slice the fish before passing it on to the next chef. So, I found the spacing between each piece to be quite long. 

I know this is Toronto, but I can't help but compare this to my experience in Tokyo where Jiro's sushi had a flow to it (from lighter tasting pieces to the heavier tasting). At Yasu, the pieces seem to be quite random - we were served baby sardines, and all the tuna came at once from lean to fatty O-Toro. Some of the fish did not taste fresh to me and the tamago at the end tasted more like cheesecake. 

We ordered an extra piece of monkfish liver sushi at the end (that was my favorite!) and when the bill arrived, we saw that we were charged $7 per piece. 

For those who enjoy Sake pairing with their meal, they offer that with the omakase for an extra $50. 

Yasu is definitely a great experience for those who have never tried it, but it is also not the best sushi in Toronto nor the freshest. Don't come here with high expectations, because you won't be blown away."}
{"text":"This place is terrible and the food wasn't even great. I got a really painful stomach bug from their seafood. After calling them they claimed the owner lives in Japan and there's nothing they can do about it. The stomach bug lasted for 2 weeks."}
{"text":"Elegy Ending in the Taste of Uni

Sometimes I say I've just had omakase with my brother--
as though we've never used coupons before--it sounds perfect
as I sit down at Yasu. I never thought I'd care about eel

in ways food TV stars perform their care, from city to city,
like a familiar home was everywhere. Now, at this bar,
I am watching four people take pictures of each piece of fish

as I finish chewing mine. The waitress comes to us
with an iPad, showing a picture of striped horse mackerel,
saying it is the chef's favorite. Omakase is a kind of art

cameras eat up. I watch our chef slice into the sides of fluke,
snapper, and amberjack. He cuts four or six at a time before
plating. I like a pause with eyes. I like a pause with a knife

picked up to make a single slice or one tender butterfly
when I'm ready. Yasu is just efficient. I watch from the bar:
art stamped out, sharp and machine-like in its delivery

and deliciousness. I could have been sitting at a table,
or lying in my bed watching Jiro Dreams of Sushi
on Netflix, me drooling, me eating up the efficiency of this uni."}
{"text":"Very good food, good atmosphere, and a very kind chef. No problems whatsoever. Definitely would recommend even though it is a bit pricy for sushi."}
{"text":"I probably would have had a good experience at this restaurant but I had a horrible experience dealing with them over their cancellation policy. I don't remember making a reservation here at all - I think a friend or relative may have done so without my knowledge while in my home with my credit card - and despite not having even come to this place or eaten their food, I was charged $191 on my credit card! I tried to explain to the manager on the phone that I did not make this reservation and it must have been done by mistake, but he barely spoke English and told me they would not be refunding me because they \"prepared fresh fish for me\". When I asked to be given this \"fresh fish\", he told me they had \"thrown it out\".

I am a student with tons of student loan debt, but even if I wasn't, it is OUTRAGEOUS to be charged $190 for a meal at a restaurant I didn't even get to enjoy simply because I missed a reservation. You would think a restaurant charging this much money would be able to cover their own costs of a few pieces of fish and balls of rice. I have literally never heard of a restaurant charging you money without your consent for a meal you didn't show up for, and the utter lack of understanding from the manager at the outset was ridiculous.

After some back and forth with the guy, he's now telling me he can't do anything or issue a refund because the owner is in Japan and controls the Yelp account. Manager told me he's going to email owner and see if he can do anything. Maybe I will update this if anything gets resolved, but I am definitely going to dispute it with Visa if it doesn't.

UPDATE: The owner of Yasu just threatened over email to \"sue me for damages\" because I am writing truthful, honest reviews about my horrible experience with this petty and greedy establishment. A restaurant that was doing well would never enforce such an unfair policy on their customers - nor would they be threatening their customers with legal action for writing honest reviews.

Moral of the story: do not give your credit card to these dishonest people because they will abuse the crap out of it with unauthorized charges in exchange for ZERO services or goods rendered. Pure thievery! 

I also read another review on Google where they basically did the same thing to a family that drove three hours to eat at their restaurant, were late because they got into a car accident, and were charged $300 with no explanation. This place sounds like it's run by the most awful person on earth. Don't bother - there are so many good sushi places in Toronto who actually care about their patrons."}
{"text":"Some of the best Sushi I've had in Toronto. On the pricier end but incredibly high quality fish and great service. I would recommend the omakase and pair it with a bottle of sake or a nice white wine."}

Rating: (10/10) Food, (10/10) Service, (10/10) Value, (10/10) Ambience, (10/10) Presentation, (10/10) Cleanliness

My Experience:  

Was taken here for a birthday dinner, and I cannot sing enough praise about this experience. Sitting at the bar and watching the chefs do their magic was like watching a performance.

Omakase was worth every dollar and I've never really had quality fish like this anywhere else. Every course was meticulously prepared and presented beautifully.

Words can't describe this amazing experience.

If you're looking for one of the best Japanese restaurants, this is a hands down winner!"}
{"text":"This was a very daring and interesting encounter. I was very timid to start, and the chef was intent on pleasing his guests.  We sat at the bar and were able to watch all the food being prepped. It is not for those with queasy stomachs who don't like people touching their food. At least I could see where the chef put his hands.  There were several courses and they got better as they went. Thoroughly enjoyed the smoked tuna? - one of the last pieces of sashimi served. And of course the black sesame ice cream was excellent. Very good quality fish. Everyone should experience this at least once."}
{"text":"I've traveled to Japan for many times and have been enjoying their foods ever since. To clarify what I mean, by \"Japanese food\" I mean something prepared in their traditional ways -- for sushi it would be no cream cheese, no spicy tuna, no fusion of any form, but a delicate bite of selected high-quality seafood and nicely flavored rice.

So here is the place in Toronto I would recommend for an authentic sushi dinner. I dined there about a month ago when this place hasn't become too popular to take a reservation for 6 pm dinner at 4:30 on the same day. Upon arrival I was warmly welcomed.

They don't have an a la carte menu, but only Omakase (means let the chef decide, like a taste menu) dinner. You'll be seated at the sushi bar (as they only have 10 bar seats), watching the chefs prepare each piece of sushi for your meal in front of you. Also the service was very friendly too, I always had my water glass filled promptly, and I did enjoy a great time chatting with the waitress about Japan, and some daily life stuff in Toronto as Asian immigrants.

Overall it was a perfect dinner. Although such a meal was a bit pricey, it really worth it. Again, a must-try for real Japanese food fans in Toronto. I'll always look forward to being there again, it's the best place to have authentic sushi in Toronto, and thus deserves 5 stars!

While the only pity to some person might be that they didn't offer any non-alcoholic drinks like fruit juice, but they do have sparkling water."}
{"text":"My Friends and I came here for the omakase (Chef's choice). The experience was phenomenal. I find a lot of times when I go for omakase the chef isn't right in front of me to explain where it's from and such and this was a food education as we were seated at the sushi bar. Every piece placed in front of us was explained and any questions we had were answered. They recommended some stuff that was in season. In our case we ordered a la cart uni (sea urchin) from Japan, even though we had some with the omakase that were from BC. There is a bit of a difference but I enjoyed both.  I also ordered the hot sake which goes great with raw fish I find. 

Overall I would come here again but reservations can be hard to get and it Yasu is on the pricier end but completely worth it."}
{"text":"Elegant sushi! Only a dozen seats available in the small place. Every customer gets intimate experience with the chef and will definitely be taken care of.  Not sure I understand the wine, but really enjoyed the sushi and dessert."}
{"text":"I had their omakase $80 with the sake pairing $50.  The pairing went well in the first round but the other rounds didn't make any difference, especially the last sake pour with the ginger ice cream -it didn't make sense.  The chef gave me another piece of uni for $8.  My only concern is a lot of the white fishes taste the same, with different texture.  The other unique pieces were amazing, IE: baby squid, or the eel from Peru."}
{"text":"Very good sushi and a fairly reasonable price for what you're getting. Definitely a must go if you're in Toronto."}
{"text":"Yasu was rated one of the top sushi places in Toronto and so for my second year anniversary, I decided to bring my girlfriend here. Coming from Vancouver, I am a \"sushi snob\" since good quality and cheap sushi is in abundance on the West. After reading the reviews it seemed comparable to sushi in Vancouver, but a tad more expensive (mild underexaggeration). I made a reservation online where I had to provide my credit card info. Due to its popularity and limited seating, if I called less than 48 hrs before my reservation date,  my credit card would be charged the full price of the omakase ($80/person) which was fair. 

Yasu did not disappoint. 18 pieces of some of the best sushi I have ever had. Every piece was crafted like a work of art. I could truly taste the subtle flavour of each sushi piece. To top it off, the sushi chef noticed I was left handed and placed each piece so it was easy to pick up. This was the icing on the cake. 

Definitely recommend Yasu for its great sushi and a unique and authentic Japanese experience."}
{"text":"My friend and I are not one to splurge normally for a meal. We had a date night at Yasu due to its recommendation, and was not disappointed. The tentative details to the meal, and each piece of nigiri was made with careful scrutiny. Worth every dollar for the experience. You cannot get the chef to diner experience in other Japanese restaurant"}
{"text":"Great dining experience when I came here for the omakase dinner with a few friends. Reservations for this restaurant have to be made almost a month in advance because they only have two seatings per night. 

The omakase menu is the chef's selection of 18 pieces of sushi and dessert. There are two tables and also seating at the sushi bar right in front of the chefs. I sat at the sushi bar which was amazing because you can see the chef making each piece of sushi. The chefs are Japanese and are very experienced and elegant in their sushi-making technique. Out of all the sushi, my favourite was the uni (sea urchin), blue fin tuna, and sea scallop. 

The service was very excellent and the chef would introduce each piece before serving it to you. The waiter also showed us pictures on a tablet for some background info on some of the sushi. The price is 80$ +HST, which is pricy but is worth it for a special occasion or when you want to treat yourself or somebody else!"}
{"text":"Yasu Sushi Bar was on BlogTO's top 10 new sushi restaurants in Toronto; it didn't make the 'Best japanese restaurants in Toronto' list, but I can safely say that it's a must-try. Right in the heart of Toronto, Yasu is a solid choice for an omakase sushi experience.

The storefront is small and unsuspecting, and the interior clean and bright, but very small. Each sitting hosts around 15 people, so it would be an understatement to say that Yasu takes their timing very seriously. When we arrived, we were told to wait over in the corner by the door and the coat rack, for our seating. There was no one sitting in our seats, but no matter, it was simply \"please wait over there\".

Luckily, that is where my gripes end. Once we were seated, the service was great, and the fish was fresh. What more can you ask for? The chef takes care to explain what you are trying with each service. Attentively, he asks if the rice and wasabi portions are to your liking, and brushes soy sauce on each piece as appropriate.

We doubled down on the toro at the end, and he took a blowtorch to our second piece. Nothing much to say but an amazing way to  end the meal."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times already and I must say their food and service is consistently good. They serve omakase ($80) and I must say it's definitely worth it. Aside from one incident when I wasn't done binging on nigiri and the waitress gave me my ice cream and I tried explaining to her that I wasn't done with my sushi fix but with the lack of English she spoke and my lack of patience I gave up and ate my ice cream misty eyed. 

The environment is a little sterile and I feel bad for even breathing sometimes but I think it might be because they want you to focus on your food instead of being distracted with everything around you?

There was once this couple pulled out their phone and watched a baseball game on loud during dinner. I was super irritated as much as I am a fan of any Toronto... the whole restaurant (it's already tiny) does not need to be filled with the commentator's voice.

I prefer Yasu over Zen and Yuzu... Have yet to tried Kaji as I heard that Yasu used to be with Kaji. I would definitely come back (already have two reso booked for the next two weeks) - booking is super simple but you can only book up to 4 people and with a credit card. Ugh, I cannot wait until Friday!"}
{"text":"My bf took me here for dinner in one if their sessions* i had high hope and expectation and i was a little disappointed*
I find the fish selections fairly average, it was very fresh consider every piece are from different places around the world* but it was not to that level* the private sessions was not very interactive through out while not interesting enough just to watch* 
I find each piece of fish slightly too thin as well* for the light fish selections, easily the rice took over the attention and texture* 
However their were a few wonderful pieces such as the toro and the monk fish liver~*"}
{"text":"Read past reviews about this place and decided to take my boyfriend here for his birthday. Right off the bat, the environment was warm and welcoming for the 6pm reservation we had. The servers greeted us, showed us to our spot on the sushi bar and offered coat check.

My boyfriend has an allergy to crustaceans and I was amazed at how the Chef made note to it and brought amazing substitutes for any dish that contained it. The entire omakase was a splendid experience for ourselves and the way they presented his dessert with a candle for his birthday (I left a note when making reservations) was the icing on the cake! 

Would highly recommend coming here for the experience of multiple fish from across the globe."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Toronto by far.  I'd been wanting to come by over a year and we finally made it for my birthday.  We got the $120 omakase that includes sashimi.  The dining experience was a very relaxed and intimate 2 hours.  We started with the beautiful sashimi platter.  We loved the crab and lobster, both were so sweet.  Next was an appetizer that I really enjoyed, salmon roe on top of some rice with two kinds of uni.  Then rare seasonal blue firefly squid in miso with seaweed was so delectable and delicious and tender!  The roe were like boba bursting with juice.  The unis were both delicious.  Then the 15 pieces of sushi.  Standouts among the amazing selection were the Hokkaido scallop, ocean trout (so oily and good!), there was a smoked fish that was delicious.  Man so many delicious pieces I could eat this over and over.  It ended with tamago and some green tea matcha ice cream with red beans.  We hadn't had an omakase like this since Nakazawa in NYC two years ago.  We were very full at the end (and I'm a big eater).  I'd go again in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"First time having omakase and, truthfully, the experience was one of the best we have ever had. Food was amazing and carefully selected. Service and hospitality was spot on. Try this place and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Sushi place in North American I ever visit. I visit cities such as Seattle, Chicago, San Diego and Los Angeles but It is good. I ordered Omakase ($80/person) for two and I told them what my wife could not eat, such as hamachi, then they arranged menu for us."}
{"text":"Wow. Okay, it's not just a meal here, it's a two hour show. It's definitely an experience and you'll want a bar seat for this. It's a two hour meal of around 21 courses. You get to watch the chef prepare each nigiri. They were all incredible. Except maybe the cod testes. I ate cod testes. What."}
{"text":"Location/Service
A very small restaurant located on Harbord St. Street parking is available and a few parking lots around the neighborhood. Inside is a very simple decor with around 16 seating available. Make sure you try to make your reservation by the bar so you can fully see how the chefs prepare all the sashimi and sushi right in front of your eyes. 
Service is also good. The waitress and chef were very detailed in explaining each piece. I had to reschedule my reservation and the waitress was quick and accommodating to make the change. 

Food
At a fixed price around $105, each meal differs day to day as it's omakase, meaning the chef's selection. For this experience, I get to experience tamago, unagi, black sesame ice cream. And a lot of imported fish such as Nova Scotia lobster, BC sea urchin, Iceland mackerel, Mexico and Japan imported fish (salmon, skipjack, cod, shimaji, scallops, blue fin tuna). 
For my first experience, I really enjoyed it and can justified its worth the price. 

Rated as the best restaurant in Canada, Yasu really deserves a 5-Star rating!"}

{"text":"If you enjoy sushi rolls covered in mayo and subpar fish - then DONT go here!

this is delicious, authentic sushi with service to match. For $80 + (plus tax and tip) you are treated to an assortment of fresh sushi. The seafood is sourced around the world, made right in front of you with a wonderful blurb about what you are eating and where it was sourced from. Each piece is delicately made and presented. We had mackerel, tuna, salmon, trout, uni, scallop and much, much more. 

The resto serves 12 only - 10 at bar top and then a private table for 2. The bar top is where you should sit - you get to see the chefs in action plus the \"vibe\" is there. Went with a friend and we ended up making friends with two other people sitting beside us - just everything I love about going out and dining. Our new dinner friends treated us to some of their sake - I cant even describe how smooth and pure that sake was. I'd love to find that bottle!

The service was wonderful, they were attentive - your water glass was never empty, they kept replacing green tea mugs so that your tea was always hot (and man that green tea was good!). My friend has been to Giro in Japan which this restaurant is often compared to. She said she could tell the difference but would continuously come back to Yasu.

Please make reservations and visit this fantastic establishment. Eat some real sushi and make some new friends and remember why Toronto really is turning into a great foodie town."}
{"text":"Yes, we've probably all seen \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\" by now, and this is probably the closest you can get to that experience in Toronto. I made dinner reservations a month in advance and received a call two days prior to confirm my reservation and to note any allergies. To say I was excited for this meal is an understatement. We arrived at a little past 7, and our reservation was at 7:15. The restaurant was already empty (previous round was a 5:15pm seating) so we went in and the waitress gave us our seat at the sushi bar. For those who are unfamiliar, there are a handful of table seats and the rest are at the sushi bar (trust me, you want the sushi bar seats). We were quickly given a drink menu and a quick description of what the night would be (omakase style, 18 pieces plus dessert, and chef recommends that you eat the entire sushi in one bite). If you're a fan of sake, they have a wide selection here, and the sake pairing (an extra $50) seemed popular among other diners. They also have wine and beer selections. 

Our sushi chef began doing some prep work shortly after 7:15 and slowly but steadily, the sushi began appearing on our plate. The chef reminded us that we should cleanse our palate with the pickled ginger on our plates between each piece. He told us what we were eating, where we were from, and answered basic questions about the fish that was being served. Honestly, half the experience was watching the chef prepare the sushi. The fish was very fresh and every piece was delicious. There will probably be a type of fish that you don't like, but that's fine. For example, I'm not a huge fan of salmon roe and there was a salmon roe sushi. During our course, my favourites were the Argentinian Red Shrimp, the striped jack, and the amberjack. Getting to taste three different cuts of bluefin tuna was also quite an experience. 

The pace of the sushi being served was perfect. I never felt rushed or felt like I was waiting too long for the next piece. However, you should try to be on time. In our section (5 people), one individual was late. The chef placed her portions aside and only began making the sushi for her after her arrival. He worked quicker than he usually would have for her servings and eventually caught up with the other four in the section. It was impressive to watch him work the timing. The staff were also very attentive. My chopstick skills are sadly lacking and I was concerned that eventually I would drop one of these master pieces on the table. After 3 pieces, I began picking up the sushi with my fingers (which is perfectly acceptable). Shortly after, a waitress came by with a little tray and a wet towel on there for me to wipe my hands. Others using chopsticks did not receive that, so I was impressed by the attention to detail.

All in all, this was a fantastic experience. Not a cheap one, but good experiences are rarely cheap."}
{"text":"We made reservations a month in advance for Friday at 7:15. We arrived early and saw the previous diners finish their meal. The wait staff and host were efficient in cleaning up and prepping for our reservation round. 

TLDR: I cried. First Omakase experience, and it's changed the way I think about food. 

We sat down right on time. The setup is very intimate; you are at the bar watching as the nigiri is made in front of you. Luckily for us, the shape of the table was a \"L\" and we were at the short-end of the bend, meaning straight sight down to each chef's prep station. 

We ordered the deluxe sashimi platter omakase menu, and my partner paired it off with the sake tasting menu. 

Absolutely blown away. 

Deluxe Sashimi - Blue Fin Tuna (México), Oyster (Vancouver), Uni (Hokkaido), Kampachi (Hawaii), Grouper, Lobster (Halifax) 

Cod Testicles

Ikura Don -  Salmon Roe (Alaska) 

Nigiri (12 Piece Set) 
1. Firefly Squid  - Hotaru Ika (Toyama Bay) 
2. Hirame - Flat Fish 
3. Sakura Shrimp - South of Mt. Fuji
4. Shima Ají (Striped Jack) 
5. Scallops - Hokkaido Japan
6. Mackarel - Norway

Break - Miso and Striped Jack Fish Broth 

7. Blue Fin Tuna - Mexico
8. Toro (Blue Fin Tuna) - México 
9. Uni - Vancouver
10. Golden Eye Nappa - New Zealand
11. Anago (Salt Water Eel) - Nagasaki
12. Tomago (Egg) 

This meal was indescribable. I was as present as I could be during this meal and wow. My mouth was on a world tour. I told my partner this is the first time I have ever cried during a meal. The toro blew my mind, it was soft, savoury and smooth that melted like butter on a frying pan... Except the frying pan was my palette. 

I wish I could describe what culinary mastery was happening behind the scenes. But I can't simply because I do not know exactly what they are doing. Their knife wielding expertise, the way they balance the flavours with just a brush of soy sauce, or a zest of yuzu fruit. It's all very impressive, and a calculated chemistry of motions. 

I wish we had taken a picture with our chef. There were three chefs working that evening, and Yasuhisa Ouchi (Executive Chef and Owner) was there. My compliments to this restaurant and for changing my perception of food. I took for granted my relationship with food, and I hope I never will again!"}
{"text":"It a great place for tasting omakase menu, and it is by reservation only. It's around $100 per person, but it worth it. My husbend and I spent our 1 year anniversry in Yasu. The dining environment is elegent, quiet, and romantic for us. The chef comes from Japan and he designed a great menu for us to enjoy different kind of Nigiri. One inconvenient thing is that there is no free parking nor a large parking lot."}
{"text":"More like a 4.75/5 - amazing, but...

The other reviewers have described what the setup is like well enough. This place is omakase - aka chef's choice. You sit at the bar (there is one table next to the window for two people), and the chef serves you as a group. He may give a few items to you individually, which is sign for \"don't wait for your group, eat it now.\"

At the end, if you want to re-order any single items, you can do so then.

We booked online, which was pretty easy breezy. We started right around the planned time, and the service was very friendly and courteous.

I also won't bother with favorites - hey, it's the chef's choice. He'll give you whatever he damn well pleases!

So why not 5/5? I may get lambasted by the people who are obsessed with authenticity, but part of the experience is you can chat with the chef about the food you're being served. There were two chefs, and the one our group had was pretty weak with his English.

So the food was absolutely fantastic, but our inability to fully communicate with him and understand the whys of the food was a bit unfortunate.

Just something to consider.

Oh, and if you've never done omakase before, make sure you leave ample time. It's the opposite of a fast food experience."}
{"text":"Be prepared for the best omakase experience in Toronto. The chef and his team's dedication to their craft is second to none."}
{"text":"I like this place cause I got to try fish that I've never had before. For the really special rare fishes, server comes out with an Asus tablet and explains what the fish is and shows some pictures. I can appreciate the educational part of the dinner. 

The thing that's annoying about this restaurant is that it only fits like 12. Resos are done online and you have to wait at least a week or two in advance which really exercises your patience. 

Not a perfect restaurant omakase experience for me though. The rice is not on point. Under seasoned for my liking. But regardless, a truly special experience. Keep your voices low. Quiet dining experience."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what Toronto needs a no fuss serious sushi spot without venturing out from the core (Zen & Kaji) or skipping on the mortgage payment (Hashimoto more kaiseki than sushi) while all of the places I have mentioned have their own forte' this spot stands on its own IMO. The place might feel pricey but good sushi is pricey and from what I have seen one can easily get close to this price range with a compromise on quality.  I didn't like some sushi offerings but that's due to personal dislike for white fish for sushi/sashimi and not due to the sub par quality. 
Here is what we had on that day
Striped jack: Good
Red snapper with uni: Not a fan of the snapper but Uni elevated this offering
Scallop with salt: Top notch. What a clever way to elevate the sweetness of scallop by adding salt to it. (I have seen this used in desserts before but didn't think of adding it elevate the sweetness of scallop bravo!) 
Monk fish liver with shiso leaf: Not a fan of this monk fish liver even though I enjoy foie gras quite a bit so I should enjoy monk fish liver but somehow I have had a colder version when I have tried it and has never gone well with moi. This is one of the better offerings I have had as served just at the right temp. Not quite foie gras but close (maybe they should call it faux gras!) 
Sardine from Portugal: Didn't like this one. Too salty. 
Sea bass. Meh
Golden eye snapper. Meh times 2
Lumberjack: Meh 
Nova Scotia snow crab. Nice serving though one could enjoy it the same if not better without the rice IMO
Salmon roe: Decent version of this hand roll.
3 pieces blue fin tuna (lean to fatty): How can one go wrong with good quality tuna. This would be the highlight offering for most people as one gets to enjoy the flavor/texture changes from the same fish. Top Notch. 
Fluke: OK
Smoked bonito: OK
Anago: Nice hand roll with good presentation. I like eel so I enjoyed it quite a bit.  
Tamago: Folks this is not your average tamago offered by majority of places. If you haven't had this style before its more like a cake with a slightly sweet finish. Just beautiful. I could have ordered more but was getting full. 
Uni: Daily special add on. One either like uni or not. 
Ginger ice cream. Hmm nice soft serve with ginger pieces that add a nice texture and thankfully not the overwhelming flavor. 
This is my first visit here so I didn't want to sully my palate with alcohol. They have a decent selection of Sake and some beer/wine options. If I recall the sake tasting add on was 50$. Might be worth looking into. 
The negative: reservations at a decent time were almost impossible for our group size even though we started testing waters a month in advance (Gulp!) I don't like abburri style sushi so I think I will ask for the items that are not prepared that way next time.  
This place demands your attention and has a seriousness about it which might not be for everyone. I personally enjoyed it as I treated it as an event meal. This is the best sushi I have had folks in Canada. I will be back."}
{"text":"All hail GTA's new King of Sushi. As good as Sushi Kaji... maybe better if your in the mood for sushi only. Yasu is officially my new GTA favourite. Special thanks to Karen L. for her brilliant recommendation. 

The restaurant is in small converted house. Only seating for 10 - all at the bar where you can watch the skilled chefs at work. Comfortable seating with a perfect angle to see the action and talk to your chef.

Service is just spectacular. The staff really gets to know you and engages in good conversation. The sushi bar has two chefs who handles 4-5 people max - perfect for learning about the fish and sushi in general. You feel like you have your own private sushi chef. Awesome experience.

Only a single Omakase menu at $80. You get about 18 pieces of sushi per person and some kick ass black sesame gelato for dessert. One seating at 6pm and a second seating at 8:30. Reservations a must.

The sushi is as fresh as anything I ever tasted. At one point the chef pulled out two  jumbo prawn that were still moving!!!! Even after he cut them, the chef pointed out that the piece of sashimi was still moving slightly (and then in my belly). Fish is flown in daily from Japan, Vancouver, Portugal and Alaska. 

The finishing touches / details are second to none. Every piece comes with little extras (i.e. various fresh spices or scented cherry blossom leaves for aroma). The chef adds both wasabi and soya sauce to every piece in appropriate quantities. Wasabi is made fresh in front of you. Palate cleansers are provided after strong flavoured fish. 

Some of the fish I enjoyed included salmon roe, mackerel, monkfish liver, bluefin tuna, flounder, Japanese red snapper, tuna zuke, sea eel, snow crab, bonito, N.Z. trout and many more... 

The couple next to us just returned from Japan and noted their experience at Yasu was largely on par.

The drink menu included about 6 wine choices, 4 beer selections and about 10 different Sake's. 

Dining perfection - Incredible food, friendly atmosphere and a truly personalized experience. I just can't recommend it enough.

BK"}
{"text":"Yasu's omakase has a global feel, sourcing ingredients from different parts of the world, keepin' the perspective fresh ;)"}
{"text":"This is one fine Japanese restaurant.  The omakase experience is extraordinary and the ingredients can't be more fresh!

Sitting at the bar allows you to interact with the chef and see their delicate and skillful techniques while they prepare each piece.  The attention to detail and subtleties add so much to the flavours of each unique piece of sushi.

The steady pace of the meal leaves you comfortably full at the end in such a way like it's the healthy pace and portion to eat at.

What used to be priced at $80pp was a steal.  At $105 I would call this fair market value.  An optional $25 upgrade for a premium sashimi is fair too and the meal is pleasant whether you opt in or out of that.

Probably not an everyday meal sort of destination but certainly a great way to indulge for a special occasion.

The only drawback?  You gotta book way ahead to ensure you get a spot!"}
{"text":"Yasu is a 5 star sushi experience. Hands down the best sushi dinner I've had in Toronto. 

This sushi restaurant offers only Omakase at $80 per person. Omakase is literally translated to \"I'll leave it to you\" meaning that you trust the sushi chef to select your menu. The Japanese consider this to be a great honour and they do not take it lightly. So if you came here expecting spicy salmon rolls, I highly doubt they'll offend you like that here at Yasu. 

The restaurant itself is very small. It is an L shaped sushi bar, with two small tables at the back. DO NOT MAKE RESERVATIONS AT THE TABLES. When I went for dinner, I noticed that the guests at the tables were trying to see from afar what the sushi chefs were doing. Omakase at Yasu is a \"dinner-and-a-show\" experience, sitting in the back will ruin the experience.

The menu changes frequently at Yasu. It is impossible to predict exactly what seafood will be available because it is imported all over the world from places such as Japan, Norway, Boston and Vancouver. I will say that recent reviews here on Yelp is nearly identical to what I had  (with one or two pieces different) so maybe it is seasonal. 

At the end of the night, the sushi chefs will ask if you want any extra pieces. I opt-ed for an extra piece of Cod Testes and Toro for an extra $8.50 and $7 respectively. 

The beauty about this restaurant is that you get to try fish from all over the world, from genuine Japanese sushi chefs. The lighting here is perfect for taking pictures, and my girlfriend spent as much time taking pictures as the sushi chefs spent making the nigiri. 
I strongly recommend this to any sushi enthusiasts for an anniversary or special date night."}
{"text":"Came by here recently for my partner's birthday. The service was so amazing even though we ended up sitting at the table near the window, and not at the bar to see the action up close. Each piece was explained with detail and care. The sushi was absolutely delicious. Some pieces were more fantastic than others. We bought a big bottle of sake which was great but wished we had done the sake pairing in the end. Definitely recommend and will return!"}
{"text":"I'll be echoing most people here, this place is fantastic. 

My tips:
1) Reserve a bar seat
2) Try to come a few minutes early so that you can get a GOOD bar seat (hopefully served by Yasuhisa, but the other guys are pretty great too)
3) The premium sashimi is so worth it (I didn't get it but my partner did and I was definitely jealous)
4) Put your phone away and just enjoy the experience!

My favourites (in no particular order) were the mackerel, the unagi, the three types of tuna, the monkfish liver, the salmon roe and tuna belly rice bowl, and the seared bonito and lobster sashimi. Oh and can't forget the tamago, that was great for a finisher. 

Their wasabi is fantastic, I've never tried wasabi like this before, they grate it right in front of you, it's so fresh and flavourful. 

We also had snow crab with crab liver, spotted prawn, fluke, firefly squid, sakura shrimp and scallop. My least favourite was the macha ice cream with red bean (I don't really think it fit in after having all that wonderful sushi). 

I also had the sake pairings. I don't drink much saki, so for me it was a nice intro into different kinds of Sake. Unfortunately, I don't remember most of the names, but I liked the one from Hiroshima and the one featured in Ocean's 13 the best, my least favourite was the last unfiltered one.

One of the best restaurants I have ever been to. Yasuhisa was also really friendly and had great attention to detail. Thanks!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for rolls drizzled with mayo or stuffed with cream cheese, don't come here.  (Just wanted to get that out of the way!)

Now that we've gone a second time, I think it's pretty safe to say this place is our favourite sushi place in Toronto.  

With only ten seats and two seating times (6pm and 8:30pm), make a reservation so you won't be disappointed.  

There is a menu for drinks with a selection of sake and beer.  

A wet towel is given to each guest to clean your hands and to continue using if you choose to pick up the sushi with your fingers.

There is no food menu.  Everyone gets the chef's choice of fish for the day.  Everything is amazing.  The texture and taste of the fish is sublime.  We are talking straight up nigiri sushi---ranging from 18-20 courses with a small dessert at the end.  $80 per person.  Totally worth it.

If you want to have traditional, Japanese sushi, this is it. The range of fish is incredible.  Last time we had Uni (sea urchin) but since it's no longer in season, we were able to try other delicacies of the day.  I've never had Shima Aji (striped jack/white trevally) before.  That was so good!  You can't find this just anywhere either!  

I can't compliment them enough.  Service was extremely friendly and welcoming.  The pacing of the dinner is very comfortable.  You can savour each piece and never feel rushed.  

I hope they get to the point where they are booked weeks (months?) in advance.  I want to see these types of places succeed.  You can tell the chef really cares about what he's serving and is maintaining high standards.

I've already recommended Yasu to numerous people, some of whom have already been and plan on returning as well.  I love making a recommendation and having it so well-received!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi place! Fishes were super fresh and the chefs were extremely kind to let us know what each pieces of sushi was and where it came from. Loved the whole experience"}
{"text":"Last night I went to Yasu with my friend. We got bar sit which is good to watch the chefs to prepare our dishes.

We got the sashimi plate along with the omakase menu. 

The sashimi plate 3.5/5 , lobster from Nova Scotia is way way way to salty, felt like I'm eating a spoonful of salt...

Other than that everything tastes good but not mind blowing.

For omakase

The toro is from Mexico which I'm disappointed that they don't use ingredient from Japan , it taste great. However not as sweet as the Japanese one I got before.

The see eel ( both of them are from Japan ) one is grill version and one is normal, are both bland even with the source lol. And still have soft blond inside the fish, although I like eel but definitely not this one.

The texture of the tamago issimilar to uncle tetsu's cheesecake but the taste is more fishy tasted.

Other thing are ok not mind blowing as well.

For the price I'm looking for more Japanese fishes lol not the fishes from local or Mexico."}
{"text":"Price: $80/person (18 dishes, including dessert and tea/water)

Service:
Nothing extravagant, but I could tell the ladies were very well-mannered and my tea was also refilled lol. Honestly, I just don't want to be thirsty. I think the chefs and the waitresses could have done a better job describing each piece of sushi, but they were okay so we are moving on. My only complaint, and apparently this happens often, is that the waitresses needed to REALLY reach past my seat to refill the tea. It's like whoever designed this restaurant thought all the waitresses would be 6 feet tall with arms like Luffy (reference to an anime character who has super long arms, from One Piece).

Food:
Amazing. *Bows head* Damn good. We were very blessed to have been served by the main chef. Goodness, my first bite was already filled with the taste of heaven (whatever that tastes like). I was honestly quite full by the end of the meal, and holy cow, that black sesame ice cream is the best in town. I tried very hard to get our waitress to spill their store secret, \"WHO IS YOUR SUPPLIER? I WANT THIS BLACK SESAME ICE CREAM\". She simply returned with a slight smile, and apologized. Why are they so polite even when they are refusing lols.

Tips:
- Eat with your hands (if it's nigiri aka fish on rice), and don't let the sushi sit there for too long
- Most of the time you don't need to dip with soy sauce, and if you do don't soak it
- Nigiri should be eaten in one bite, with the fish-side down (which I did not do btw)
- Cleanse your palete by taking a small bite of ginger in between each serving
- Book ahead of time and prepare to sit/eat for 2 hours
- Get a seat at the bar, not at some faraway table because you won't get the full"}
{"text":"I went to many sushi restaurants in and out of Japan and I feel like this is the best sushi I have ever had. I went there with my husband and we had a great time. Excellent service, nice interior and seasonal fresh ingredients. It's not cheap but for a true sushi experience, it is worth it. If we have a chance to go back to Toronto, we definitely want to return."}
{"text":"Came back for round 2 for my birthday about a month ago. I won't go into detail about all my pieces like my last review, but this is my general impression.

1) Wasn't as impressive as the first time around. Pieces felt smaller. (Picture evidence showed that the Uni sushi was much smaller this time).
2) Fish selection was too similar to the first time around (I was hoping for something different. Is it the season? Last time I came was also around the same time).
3) Was still hungry after. Went for a pizza afterwards :\
4) The filefish sushi with filefish liver on top was perhaps my newest discovery and the best piece of the night.

Still excellent quality sushi overall, but something was lacking compared to the first time. Less wow factor in terms of quality, and smaller pieces made it feel the value has gone down a little.

9.25/10 for the quality. 9.5/10 for the service. 8/10 for the value. 9/10 overall (not an average)"}
{"text":"Treated to a 18 piece omakase for a special occasion, and it did not disappoint in both experience and taste.

The service is very attentive. They offer to check your coat and immediately presented us with a wine/beer list (psst, Sapparo is $8). You can also do a 5 type sake tasting add on for $50. 

Three chefs served the dining area. We sat at the bar and I don't know what the point of going would be if you got stuck in either the booth, or the window table, frankly. Half of the experience, in my opinion, is getting to see the sushi chefs at their best -- carefully slicing fish and immaculately assembling sushi.

We got to sample two different types of sea urchin (one from Vancouver, one from Boston). We also got to sample a piece of firefly squid, which only appears during certain periods of the year. We also received some Norwegian mackerel. They served a piece of blue fin tuna alongside its less fattier counterparts, which I thought was cool. The chefs made a point of communicating which fish was what, and from where it originated. The servers would also go around and display photos and background information about the more rarer items (i.e. the squid). The fish was clearly fresh - no fishy taste at all.

We ended with a piece of fluffy egg, and dessert was black sesame ice cream.

I feel this is definitely a fun date night/special occasion type place, mainly for the experience of being able to view the sushi chefs in action.

Both the chefs themselves and the servers asked for feedback, and offered additional pieces if needed."}
{"text":"$80 per person for a set menu (17 pieces). The experience was very unique, I don't regret coming here. 
 
It's best to be seated in-front of the bar where you can see the sushi chefs create the dishes. 

The fish was truly fresh, I could taste the sweetness of each one, but I give three stars because of the rice to fish balance on each sushi. I feel like there was too much rice. The quality of the soya sauce was really tasty however I feel like they put too much.  The rice and soya sauce combined overwhelmed the taste of the fresh fish. Half way through my meal I had to roll the sushi so that the fish is sitting on top of my tongue first before I took a bite to really get that fish taste. 

Other than that, the service was great. Our waiter was very polite. The dishes were served at the right pace. You'd think 17 pieces won't fill you up, but with that amount of rice, it definitely will."}

I loved everything, the SUSHI, atmosphere, decor, seating, cleanliness etc. It definitely on par, if not better than what I experienced in Japan (*mainly comparing against Sushi Dai in Tsukiji Market). My boyfriend was skeptical at first but after the first piece of sushi, he was amazed how Yasu can pull this off in Toronto. He agreed 100% that it is on par with Japan sushi, we only wish that this experience can last forever. Freshness and variety of fish, chefs' technique, excellent service, atmosphere and money for value; overall it was perfect, my boyfriend and I walked out all happy and satisfied!! Try it yourself ~

{"text":"I went to Yasu with pretty low expectations despite the high ratings because I usually get let down by a lot of higher end sushi places in Toronto. Yasu definitely exceeded my expectations!

I think you definitely have to sit by the sushi bar to get the whole experience. The chefs are very technical and I was blown away by the way they cut all the fish with care, and place the sushi at the right angle, etc. They really aren't there to entertain your conversation but you really don't need the conversation to be amazed. I loved the way they chose their cuts, their knife craftsmanship, the way the smoked some pieces, and how fluffy their egg was. It was interesting how they put the two sea urchins from the opposite coasts to compare their flavours. I've eaten uni from both coasts but it was interesting to compare them side by side. Their salmon roe was pretty high grade and I've only seen similar ones in Japan. The ones that make it here are usually small, not sweet, and not plump... I was most blown away by their quality of the red meat tuna! Such a popular sushi but it was definitely the smoothest I've had, and I would say that I had my fair share of sushi from Japan. Sublime. The chutoro and ootoro were good too but I may have had better. Other pieces were all very delicate in flavour and texture and I left very satisfied. I may not have been completely full but I was still so satisfied. Great place for people who can appreciate sushi and I thought the price was reasonable for the quality of cuts they provide.

Thanks Yasu for the experience!"}
{"text":"Absolutely brilliant restaurant. It's a small place, sure -- with a long white bar, black stools, and a single glass table near the window (that was happily reserved for little ol' me!) but the high-quality menu, renowned chefs, and knowledgeable staff made this place truly unforgettable.

I went with a friend for the 18 course omakase, the first of many for both of us, and with servings from Norway, Boston, and all over the coasts of Japan... it was the best sushi experience I've ever had. The chefs cut the fish in right of you, separated by the different levels of the bar, the sake selection is long, and the tea was plentiful. The only fault I'd give (which I'll try not to generalize the actual establishment with) would be the sexism the waitress displayed when she declared \"this sake is good for girls\" as she handed me a glass (when I said I didn't drink, mind you). The stereotype that girls can't take hard liquor never ceases to amaze me, and the fact that they would allow such inequality in a restaurant as classy as this was a bit of a shock.

Nevertheless, I powered through and even ordered three other favorite pieces after the 18, which were just as beautiful and delightful as the first time. I suggest the monkish liver, as well as the different types of ootoro (\"medium\" is always a good choice). I can't exactly see myself coming here again, as the service does need some work with how much you're paying, and the bathrooms upstairs are of that which you'd see at any 7-11. But hey! I had good company, the best sushi, and was generally astounded the entire time (the way the chefs sliced and diced the sushi... with the exact measurements in each piece...), so you never know."}
{"text":"OMGkase with kids. My son and daughter watch way too much food vlogs on YouTube and after Simon and Martina from @eatyourkimkchi moved to Japan and changed to @eatyoursushi the kids followed suit. Somewhere between the worlds best seafood with @_mattgranger and dining on a dime with @staletwizzlers we found YASU.

This was the first omakase experience for the @dalenliashow and they've been pretty adventurous when if came to sushi in the past, but were completely California roll and salmon washed when it came to their palate.  18 pieces of chefs choice was just what they needed. 

Pricey sophistication mixed with a laissez faire  eat with your hands attitude.  It was perfect to bring your kids to for a special experience.

Don't be afraid to talk to your sushi chef.  We found out that Chef Yasu has a 4yr old that loves pizza. So make sure you sit at the bar! 

Definitely will be back once we save up our spare change."}
{"text":"The sushi was amazing. It doesn't quite compare to what you get at sushi restaurants in the fish market in Tokyo, but this is definitely one of the best sushi you can get in Toronto. Watching the chefs make each piece of sushi added to the dining experience."}
{"text":"This is one of my more difficult reviews, because I'm not sure if it's substance reflects my own ignorance or the pretentiousness of the restaurant itself.

We were there at 6 PM for the \"first sitting\" on a Wednesday evening. There were 12 guests at an \"L\" shaped bar overlooking the preparation area and four of us at two tables. (Note in one case barstools are near the window at a small roundtable and the other a bench at a narrow table at the back of the restaurant.
The demographics were quite interesting; the average age of the diners must have been significantly less than 30 years old, and 12 of the 16 were of Asian origin, the rest Caucasian. The demographics of the group that came in for the \"second sitting\" reflected very much the same demographics.

There were two servers who worked in front of the bar and three chefs who worked behind it. We had been phoned two days in advance to determine if we were interested in the \"Standard\" menu at $80 per person or the \"Chefs Selection\" menu at $120 per person. We chose the former.

There was quite a pause at the beginning, while the three chefs set themselves up. The guests ordered drinks. A good selection of Sakes and a short list of red and white wines. We had a glass of the most basic sake, cold - I don't think warm was an option, and a bottle of fine Albarino at $70.

After a while the sushi started to appear two by two each time. 
In our case scallops from Japan and firefly squid. We were shown a video of the latter on a laptop that was taken around to the guests. One saw them leaping about in the sea and was told they only lived for a year. They were cute but not exceptional.
Next was fluke from Boston which was bland and snow crab from Nova Scotia. Snow crab is out of season, so it tasted very wilted.
This was followed by Striped Jack from an island South of Kyoto which tasted like the fluke from Boston and the scallop from Japan. In a blind tasting I doubt I could have distinguished between the three of them. 
There was a slight shocked look when we asked if we could have soy sauce. The answer was \"no\" .The only variation we could make from the chef was to add ginger. We were also told that it was strongly recommended to eat them in one complete piece. I found this rather uncomfortable on occasion.
 With the Striped Jack came fatty tuna which was more like a tartar with seaweed binding and was good.
Next appeared monkfish liver with Japanese mint leaf - slightly bitter, very mushy but with a rich complex taste. It was accompanied by Amber Jack which was slightly stronger tasting but not that much different from the Striped Jack, the scallops, etc.
I imagine I simply don't have a sufficiently educated/sophisticated pallet for this.
Then came three Maguro - lean, fatty, and very fatty. It was certainly interesting to make the comparison between three. The lean I found to be excellent, more like beef. The fatty was mild but more bland and the very fatty I found tough with a soft taste.
Salmon egg wrapped in seaweed came next, with a mild somewhat salty taste. Its partner was sea urchin sludge, Uni from Boston, which I've always found overrated.
This was followed by Sea Trout which was lovely, soft, subtle and the best so far. It was accompanied by smoked Bonito which is rather like the lean tuna.
Last was Mackerel with its characteristic oily and strong taste with a bit of vinegar and some radish on top. Beside it was eel, Unagi, which was very good.
We were also given a Japanese desert egg dish, (Tomago?) with white fish in it and finally a small portion of black sesame ice cream.

Overall, I have to say that the sushi  did not \"sing\".
One felt slightly that one was in a \"straight jacket\" and it was \"this way or the highway \"

The music was very soft and one felt one's conversation could be heard by those all around. Any frivolity would have been severely frowned upon. This was serious stuff,   or was it?. 
We hardly had time to decide because the \"second sitting\" was already upon us standing in the entrance to the restaurant and outside."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi meal I've had outside of Japan! They say you get what you pay for and that couldn't be more true. The restaurant is modern and fancy, but really small so you really get an intimate experience, especially if you sit at one of the bar seats. 

I loved the \"sitting at the bar and having the chef hand you each piece of sushi\" atmosphere - I also haven't gotten that experience since I last went to Japan either. You get 18 pieces of sushi - most of them are standard but a few a seasonal specialities. Go with an open mind because if you ask about what the specialty sushi is, you might not wanna eat it anymore ;) 

Remember that they only have about 20 seats and 2-3 sittings per night so make sure you reserve in advance. I think this is THE perfect place for a special night, be it a birthday or anniversary, ESPECIALLY for sushi lovers."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I know how to properly articulate my experience here. After all, I'm just an uptown Markham girl who grew up in a saturated market of how-much-sushi-can-you-stuff-in-your-face-at-this-ayce-to-make-your-money's-worth?

This was my first omakase so I'll try my best and hope to do it justice. 
The omakase was an 18-course meal that consisted of, in order: crab, shima aji, scallop, red snapper, fatty tuna, mackerel, uni, shrimp, tuna, salmon roe, monkfish liver, salmon, mackerel again, smoked bonito, eel hand roll, and tamago. I sat along the bar so I was able to watch the three sushi chefs handcraft every piece with precision and care. Everything was so fresh and the quality of ingredients that they used were among the best that I've ever eaten. My favourites were the crab (how often do you get real crab and not that artificial meat?!), shima aji (oh my gahddd, I had to inquire about this one cause I had not tasted anything so unique and delicious before and the waiter told me it was a popular fish in Japan but hard to find in Canada), scallop (which is my all time favourite fish so I might be bias), and salmon roe (which was just a burst of happiness in my mouth). 

My boyfriend and I also shared an order of the sake pairings to complement the omakase. Some were sweeter than others, and some were more pungent - my favourite one was Yama yuzu which had a sweeter base and an added kick of citrus. I mean, I can see the added value of getting a little loose with these drinks and getting to try different types of sake, but I'm not sure I would say it's worth the additional $50. 

Overall, I had a pretty good experience and I loved that I wasn't judged for taking photos of everything (since everyone else was doing it too)! The food was great, and the price point definitely reflects it. My only comment for improvement is that they could use a little work on the dessert, which was just a small scoop of black sesame ice cream that wasn't any different from grocery bought ice creams."}
{"text":"OMFG!  Hands down, my best Omakase experience ever! The 6:00PM seating session started promptly and each sushi chef took their position on the counter and began their preparation for the evening. Watching Chef Ouchi meticulously hand prepare each piece of sushi was an art performance all on its own. He handled each piece of fish with so much grace and fluidity which added to the experience.  Chef Ouchi described each type of sashimi used and the origin of the fish. We were all dining globally as each piece of fish came from a different country.  The sushi does not require any additional soy sauce or wasabi since each piece contains a little bit of freshly grated wasabi and was brushed with a light layer of soy sauce and served immediately to each restaurant patron.  The seasoned sushi rice created a harmonious balance to the sashimi.  The meal ended with a piece of tamago which was a prelude to the spoonful size serving of black sesame ice cream.  I highly recommend opting for the premium sashimi appetizer and with the sake pairing.  

Reservations are a must as the establishment only accommodates not more than 20 people per dining session and I believe there are only two sessions available each day. You'll have the option of making reservations for either table seating or sushi bar (this one is a no brainer, sushi bar is where you'll enjoy your dining experience the most).  I'm beyond impressed and felt so honoured to have had the opportunity to dine at Yasu."}
{"text":"A very intimate way to have omakase.  I think there may only be about 15 seats available.  So, reservations are imperative.  The food just melts in your mouth and the decor is super clean.  A great place to take a date.  And for $80 per person omakase, you just can't lise!"}
{"text":"What a great nigiri omakase. The Mexican Blue Fin Tuna was so good I had to do the maguro, chtoro and otoro set twice. Other highlights were the bonito and tamago (which had the texture of cheese cake).
Will go back and try with the sake pairing.
A really nice experience."}
{"text":"Not as great as I had hoped. Kaiji Sushi is better. Food presentation and uniqueness of the preset menu was lacking. Most were just regular sushi pieces with the fish being the variation. I also don't like how you're rushed out as soon as your block of reservation time is up (restaurant can only accomodate 12 seats at a time). Would rather go back to Kaiji."}
{"text":"This is the second time I come to this restaurant (yesterday) and just realized this is my first review for this restaurant. But I guess it really doesn't matter as thisreview is based on my most recent visit.

The score is higher than 4 stars but abit lower than 5 stars. The freshness of the seafood are great and tasty, no questions about it. Overall, it's good 18 pieces of sushi from the tasting menu for $80. I think I am pointing out details that may or may not matters to others but are these things that prevented me from giving a 5 stars.

The choice of seaweed they use for pieces such as the negi toro and Ikura are not the best kind of seaweed I have tried before. The seaweed aroma is not as strong as the one I have before, and it can make a difference. But don't get me wrong, the overall taste of the sushi is still good but i guess it would be even better if use a different kind of seaweed with stronger taste.

Another thing I like to point out is that (maybe it's just my problem) there are some pieces, when I pick up the sushi with my chopsticks, it feels like the rice is gonna fall out any second and I need to bring it to my mouth quickly before it falls apart. Not exactly I like to see ...

I guess those two would be the only not so perfect details and I think that's about it. The overall experience was pleasant, just like the first time I was there. Considering you get 18 good tasting/fresh pieces of sushi for $80, it's a plus for me. :) Most importantly, 18 pieces is good portion for me as I am not a big eater. The service was sincere and I got my table on time. I was actually 10 min early and get to be seated right away. I also like the friendly attitude from my sushi chef and also taking the time to tell me the name of each sushi and where the fish came from - in an audible pleasant voice as well .. sometimes in other places, the sushi chef would speak in such low volume that you can hardly hear what they are say about the sushi. :)

The place is clean and tidy, comfortable and quiet, an environment where I can relax, focus on the sushi and enjoy my dinner. Yasu is easily a 4 stars restaurant and just slight below 5 stars considering all of the above. I will come again for sure! Keep up the great job!"}
{"text":"waoooooow this place is amazing. It really set the bar high for any regular sushi place I go to now. 

Quality of every ingredient really shined through - the rice, the sashimi, the seaweed. Amazing quality. We came in February, and I believe the menu change due to in-season of the ingredients. It was artful and informative about where the ingredients come from. 

This was my first time trying omakase and it's truly an excellent experience. Everything was top notch - excellent service, excellent atmosphere, food was delicious. We booked at least one month in advance to be able to sit at the bar for 3 people. I really enjoyed my experience and it's definitely worth the splurge!"}
{"text":"Splurge sushi - the best kind of 'treat yo-self' sushi. 

You are seated at the chef bar, being pampered. You watch as the chef takes out each piece of fresh fish and prepare it right in front of you eyes. The anticipation and the wait makes every piece enjoyable. You chat with friends and there is no one to rush you with your meal. The chef makes small talk and the hostess is also super accommodating. It almost feels like you are a guest at their home and they are showing off their expensive knife and fresh fish from Japan (and Portugal, Alaska, etc) 

I understand traditional sushi has wasabi inside - but the amount was a tad too much for my tolerance. Some pieces had me tearing! 

All in all, it was a great experience and we all left with satisfied belly."}
{"text":"This was my first omakase experience. I came here with my best friend and we did the sake pairing as well as the premium sashimi. It was probably one of the best sushi and sashimi I have ever tasted. The wasabi is real wasabi - the chef grated fresh wasabi from the root. The sake pairing worked perfectly and the chefs were all so friendly. Although it's super expensive, it was worth every penny. Amazing experience!"}
{"text":"I had a foodgasm.  Each pice of sushi delivered was better than the last.  Nothing more to say. Outstanding."}
{"text":"Wow. Girlfriend and I ate here last night and it was a spectacular meal. Yasu serves Omakase (chef's choice/tasting menu) only, and that's really for the best. Being left to do your own ordering would almost certainly result in a less exciting meal. The Omakase is $80pp and well worth it. 18 pieces of incredible sushi, generally in order from more mild (we started with scallop) all the way to stronger flavours like smoked bonito and BBQ eel, each with their own distinct flavours and textures. The chefs explain the type of fish and it's origin (lots from Japan, Boston, BC...clearly they source the best of the best). You just sit back and let them take you through the journey. On that note, try to reserve seats at the bar, not at a table. A huge part of the experience is watching the masterful preparation!

Service was excellent. The waiter helped me pick out a great sake to drink with my meal, but honestly I preferred drinking green tea before eating more sushi, as is does a better job of cleansing the palate and preparing you for the next piece. Before beginning service, the chefs ask if you have any allergies or aversions. I don't like uni, so the chef chose a replacement piece for me that was not even part of the meal, so that I had no repeats. At the end, before desert, you'll have an opportunity to order any additional pieces a la carte but we were absolutely stuffed!

This was an experience I will absolutely repeat."}
{"text":"Probably the most expensive sushi I've ever eaten but was it worth it? Hell yes!

There were only about 18 pieces of sushi but we sat there for 2 hours enjoying each piece to the fullest. You can just tell that each piece of sushi was created with care and love. The rice and fish worked wonderfully and nothing overpowered one another - epitome of true Japanese cuisine. 

The servers were very nice and took the time to go over some of the fish we ate. I enjoyed every single piece of sushi and the dessert was absolutely divine as well!"}
{"text":"Came here for a special date night and was blown away by the variety and freshness of sashimi. There's select dining times only so make sure to reserve tables beforehand! 

The restaurant seats 13-15 people, mostly seated around the sushi bar and a table for two on the side by the window. No matter where you sit, you're still close enough to see the live action of food being prepared before your eyes. It's really quite impressive how intricate each sushi is. 

The omakase meal involved 18 pieces, mostly consisting of sushi topped with tamago and scallop sashimi. My favourite is the monk fish liver and the Saba (mackerel). So delicious! There was also a smoked flounder sushi that was paired with ginger and green onion that was a close second. This is just to show you the variety of fish and sushi as part of the meal! 

Service was great and servers were very attentive throughout the experience. The whole meal took 2 hours, since each sushi is served one piece at a time, however it was well worth every second of waiting for the next piece. 

Do try it!"}
{"text":"Wow. My fiancé took me here to celebrate my birthday and wow. The quality of the fish is probably one of the best I've experienced. The waiters come around with an iPad and educate you on where the fish is from and what part you are eating. Each bite is well balanced, and melts in your mouth like butter. Space is limited and works on a reservation basis. Completely in love with the food and service, expensive but very reasonably priced for the amazing quality. Will 100% come again. Environment: 10/10 Food: 10/10 Service: 10/10"}
{"text":"Probably the best meal of my life! I love the uni. I really like the vibe and the interacting with the chefs. Sitting at the bar is also great for people watching."}
{"text":"Had a lovely 2 hour meal at Yasu - enjoyed the company of the other diners, and well as joking around with and asking Chef Yasu questions. Our favourite was the Scotland trout, the Japanese eel (yasus favourite) and the stripe jack. You also can't go wrong with the classic tuna trio. Highly suggest for a special occasion or to experience something different!"}
{"text":"Excellent sashimi and sushi, a bit pricey, but would definitely go back again.
Tried rare and exotic fish sashimi, very good dining experience."}
{"text":"18 pieces of sushi at the Chef's choice and an ice-cream dessert for $80 per person. Worth the price of admission in every way. 

Yasu is a small space consisting of a bar which seats about 12 people and 2 tables behind that. TIP: Sit at the bar for the full experience. You'll be able to watch the chefs in their element, crafting each piece with precision and care, sprinkled with the right ingredients or sauce to enhance the taste of the fish to the best that it could be. They then place it directly onto your plate under the most perfect lighting for a photo op which is essentially every foodie's dream. The fish is gleaming from the freshness, laid on top of the sushi rice where you can identify every single grain. Pretty much sushi in HD.

The menu changes depending on the season/whatever is freshly imported. A few things that were served for my dinner include: striped jack, ikura handroll, 3 cuts of blue fin toro, cod testicles, mackerel, sea eel, monkfish liver and seared sweet shrimp. As for dessert, it was ginger icecream which was light and refreshing. The highlight of the night for me was the Cod Testicles which was creamy and surprisingly delicious, despite how much I was cringing at the thought of what I was actually eating. Tastes almost like Uni without the sea smell. 

It was my first time having omakase in Toronto with my one other time in Japan at the Tsukiji Market. Yes, we're paying almost triple the price but it's probably as good as it gets here, people! We're not shying far from the real deal (in terms of quality) at all. An absolutely wonderful experience that everyone should indulge in."}
{"text":"Great experience!!! Absolutely delicious and fresh fish/seafood, with seasonal items I've never tried before or even heard of, like firefly squid. Everything?is beautifully presented, service is great. The restaurant is quite small - only 12 seats or so, with three sushi chefs showing off their chops in front of you. I can't say enough good things about this place, just go! Sake pairing was great too."}
{"text":"Best omakase in Toronto. 
Each piece of sushi is served one at at time.
I would love to dine here everyday if I was able to afford it!"}
{"text":"At Yasu, I would compare each bite to the first kiss at the end of a date. The careful preparation by the chef is the date itself, building up to the moment. He presents the sushi carefully in front of you, and it's like you're staring into the eyes of someone you really like. You take a bite and explore the flavours and textures. And just like a first kiss, it's slow, deliberate, and sweet. 

Sitting at the sushi bar, Yasu's mastery of minimalism is clear. Things are black and white, polished and organized. Each piece of sushi is highlighted with just one or two extra ingredients. The chefs are clearly dedicated to their craft. You can sense their disappointment in a slight head shake if something is not up to standard. Every imperfection is carefully carved away. 

Preparations start promptly and piece after piece arrive at a good pace. Everything is meant to be eaten in one bite. There's monkfish liver from Bosnia, a fatty and rubbery delicacy that is cut perfectly by a sliver of shiso leaf. Then comes red shrimp from Argentina and fluke from North Carolina, that taste like the sea the moment your tongue touches it. Alaskan Salmon roe that explodes on impact, enhanced by yuzu zest. Creamy sea urchin from opposite coasts. A tuna journey from Mexico that takes you from smooth to decadent. Striped jack, Amberjack, sea eel, things that I have never heard of, let alone tasted. On and on it goes until you reach 18 pieces and you're left in a state of pure bliss.  

Servers are prompt, informative, and professional. Endless sake is brought out and described in great detail. The plum wine is a perfect palette cleanser in between dishes. You are encouraged to ask the chef questions though chatter is kept to a quiet minimum. It is, after all, a show. And the chef's handiwork doesn't demand, but encourages, undisturbed respect. 

No, this isn't a complex 'mouthgasm'. It's not a messy love affair, like tacos, or a complicated whirlwind of spices and herbs, like curry. It's a different kind of delicious, simple and beautiful. All of your senses are engaged. Take a bite. Fall in love. Repeat. 

(100/100) - 2016, Yes...I might've planned for Yasu to be my 100th review of the year :). Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Yasu was planned about a month in advance as the grand finale of my latest trip to the city. I had never experienced high end sushi in Toronto, and wanted to try. It's almost difficult to refer to Yasu as a sushi restaurant, because it's such a gorgeously unique, intimate experience.

Upon arrival you're warmly greeted by both hostesses and immediately seated, and provided with some fresh green tea. There are only ten seats in the restaurant, which is why I made the reservations so far in advance. As far as I know, it is full during both seatings every day.

Shortly after 6 PM, the show began. My friend and I arrived first and so got what, in my estimation, was the best spot: right next to the sushi chef and owner, along the shortest side of the bar. For the next two hours we watched him artfully, carefully, provide about 15 varieties of nigiri.

Yasu shines, I had read, in what unusual and very fresh fish it is able to source. Both proved to be very true. Each fish was described to us by the chef, and in this he was assisted by the hostesses who gracefully float around with tablets that illustrate the fish when it is whole.

I ate some fish I had had before, mostly in the US, such as fluke, mackerel (two varieties were served), or fatty tuna. And they were all wonderful. The chef lightly brushes each fish with a housemade soy-wasabi glaze, and encourages you to ask for either more or less. But I also ate some nigiri I hadn't had anywhere else: bluefin tuna, baby sardine, Alaskan salmon roe, or monkfish foie gras. Each piece was beautiful, fascinating, and very different in texture, taste, and feel from the last.

Occasionally, pieces are accented very lightly with some form of garnish or added flavour. Be it a finely chopped white radish, some thin ginger paper, a smoky flavour, or a touch of fresh wasabi, watching the chef meticulously craft each identical piece was an amazing experience.

As the night progresses, the diners become more friendly and intimate with the chef and with each other. While the two chefs do not speak to one another at all, they are happy to chat and joke with patrons without losing focus. The size of Yasu is perfect for a party of two to appreciate the breadth of the experience.

I also opted for the chef's sake pairing and would recommend it for people like me: I was impressed by the detail put into their sake list but don't know enough about it to truly make an informed decision. You get five different sake samples, each slightly larger than two ounces. As with the food itself, each variety is chosen by the chef and explained in some detail, and so you walk out having learned a lot about sake. The citrus dessert sake was the most curious but probably my least favourite.

Yasu is not a place to go every night. It's a place to appreciate on rare occasions, or even just once. Which brings me back to not referring to it as a sushi place. I can eat more conventional sushi every day, anywhere, but this was a unique experience that's meant to enjoy, educate, and savour."}
{"text":"Definitely did not eat a bad thing on the menu. Overall, it's pretty pricy - but if you have the money and you're looking for an omakase experience, then I recommend it! It's 20 pieces, plus an additional $25 for a sashimi plate, and everything was delicious. 

My only gripe was that I definitely didn't feel fully satisfied at the end of the meal for the price of the meal. Also, make sure to get a bar seat when you're making your reservation!!"}
{"text":"Incredible!  Best sushi in Toronto.

Small chic restaurant tucked away on Harbord street and seating only 19 patrons at a time, served by 3 sushi chefs.  Dinner is set course omakase only lasting about 2.5hrs.  Bar seats are best as you can watch chef prepare your meal.  Each piece is prepared one by one and hand served to you by your chef who explains what the piece is called and where the fish originated from.  The sushi is high quality, fresh, and delicious.  I can't recall how many pieces were in the set omakase (somewhere between 15 and 17 I believe) but it was a lot of food and by the end, I was stuffed.  You can order up to 3 additional special pieces once the menu is done including shirako (aka cod's testicles).  I did not try the special pieces as I was full but my companion did; the shirako had a mixed review.  The vibe is minimalistic, quiet and sophisticated.  Other diners were serious foodies with large cameras to document each piece of sushi.  The restaurant is almost awkwardly quiet at times.  Definitely a place that requires all attention to be on the food itself.

Yasu is a fantastic high end sushi experience.  I would definitely go back but would tend to reserve Yasu for special occasions as it is a long meal and a filling one - I would choose the early seating and plan a long walk afterwards!"}
{"text":"4.25/5. Yasu is great (it was actually quite difficult to get a reservation) and intimate. All the pieces were really fresh and the price was definitely fair for the quality of the sushi served. We won't spoil any of the details but their egg was surprisingly one of the highlights of the night, and that's not to say that the sushi was bad; that was just how good the egg was."}
{"text":"I am sorry to say this place only deserves 3 stars. I wanted to like it, I was excited to try it, I had such high expectations, but we all know how the saying goes - no expectations, no disappointments. The experience began with a bunch of diners huddled up outside Yasu on the sidewalk in the rain, as the dinner was set to begin at 7:15 and they would not open a minute early. 

My friend and I were seated at the sushi bar and our omakase experience began. We were presented with 18 pieces of sushi, one at a time, with the chef explaining what type of fish each was as it arrived. By no means was the sushi bad, but for the price we paid and the hype of the place, it definitely wasn't good enough. Perhaps I am spoiled by my experiences in Japan and even from times in Vancouver (sashimi on the west coast is amazing), but the quality of the sushi is just not comparable. Even by Toronto standards, I have had fresher, better, more authentic sushi/sashimi elsewhere in the city. Also, I feel the presentation of the nigiri could seriously be improved. 

The bill per person (including a bottle of wine) came to $150. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi I've ever had. I've never been to Japan but I can only imagine this venue comes close to the real deal if not hits the nail on the head. I sat at the chef's bar and loved every bite I had. Tried things I never would have and learnt about new seafood. This is an incredible experience that I cannot forget and need to return to ASAP! Strongly recommend to all Toronto sushi lovers out there!"}
{"text":"First time experiencing Omakase dinner and eating authentic sushi. By far the best sushi and sashimi I've ever had. Every bite makes me crave more. 

Omakase menu is 109$ per person, definitely pricey, but the quality of every dish is worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Food: our long awaited Yasu date was fantastic when we finally managed to book a seat for 2 ( often need to reserve few weeks ahead but not too advanced since they only open the calendar for up to the month). We were served at the bar which was great since we got to watch the chefs do their magic for the omekase. We enjoyed trying each piece as it was served to us. I think it tastes really fresh and tasty. The uni was delish ( sweet as it should taste) and I remember loving the different sashimi tuna slices ( separated from fat, medium fatty, and extra fat). We also did the Sake pairing with the sushi meal. We had a very polite and kind waitress.

Seating: small restaurant. The bar has about 7 to 8 seats, where you can see the chef prepare your food. The other table were small ( can seat 2 tables of 4). Not a big restaurant at all. Should probably go with a small group.

Reservation: definitely call or book online ahead of time for reservation. Make sure you are punctual. Everyone is served for each session at the same time. The chefs make sure everyone is here ( not just your party, but the restaurant customers) for that round and then they will start. 

Loved our experience here. I've recently been to Japan.... And my love for Japan's omekase is still the best. 

Location: small restaurant in a quiet street downtown Toronto

Parking: Street and paid parking"}
{"text":"This restaurant may be very good but the way they treat potential customers is not. I walked in and was told to wait a few minutes. After being ignored for over 10 more minutes while about 8 open seats were in front of me I decided to walk out and will kit be back. If they were fully reserved they could have said so rather than waste my time on this frigid night. Also, it's not very impressive looking inside, rather tiny, and whomever called the decor modern doesn't understand the concept."}
{"text":"My first omakase experience and it did not disappoint. The service was exceptional and the food was amazing. It's a small restaurant so I would recommend reserving and sitting at the bar to get the full experience. There is only 3 time slots in a day as well (5,7:15 and 9pm). You would however need to provide your credit card and if you cancel within 48 hours of your seating they will charge you the full amount. The omakase is chosen by the chef can differ day to day. You get 18 pieces and dessert. The chef would cut each piece freshly and prepare it right in front of you. They recommend to eat each piece in one bite. I loved the toro, monkfish(foiegras), scallop and Boston uni. For dessert I had the black sesame ice cream (rich in flavour).It was definitely worth the money and is considered reasonable price for an omakase. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"4.5 stars but minus 0.5 for not taking American express...any high end restaurant should accept Amex. .."}
{"text":"Yasu offers a truly authentic Japanese sushi dining experience. I've never had the opportunity to try Jiro's Michelin star restaurant in Japan, but this place certainly rivals any of the top sushi places here and is comparable to other top notch sushi places I've tried in Japan.

On weekends, they have three services nightly starting at 5:00, 7:15, and 9:30 pm. All patrons at the bar and surrounding tables are served simultaneously by 3 skilled Japan-trained sushi chefs. After spending years washing dishes and peeling daikon as an apprentice, they have come a long way to become truly master sushi chefs. Watching them slice the fish to the perfect thickness, forming the delicate rice balls, and adding just the right amount of freshly grated wasabi effortlessly is a real joy to watch. As others mentioned, definitely worth sitting at the bar to get the full experience watching the chefs prepare the sushi.

The menu is very simple with only one choice, the $105 omakase, which consists of 14 pcs of sushi, a Dashi soup, and ice cream. The only option is whether to add the premium sashimi plate for an additional $25, which consists of a small oyster, a piece of uni (sea urchin), and 5 assorted pcs of sashimi.

The main omakase dishes for the night consisted of:
(1) White shrimp from Toyama Japan with yusu. 
(2) Shredded toro from Mexico with Ikura from BC. 
(3) Anikimo monkfish liver from Boston. 
(4) Lobster from Nova Scotia. 
(5) Ocean trout from Scotland. 
(6) Scallop from Hokkaido Japan. 
(7) Saba from Norway. 
(8) Red shrimp from Argentina. 
(9) Dashi soup. 
(10-12) Bluefin tuna all from Mexico. Maguro (lean part near bone), Chu Toro (near skin), and OToro (belly). 
(13) Snow crab with crab liver from Nova Scotia. 
(14) Anago sea eel from Nagasaki Japan. 
(15) Egg. 
(16) Black sesame ice cream.

The sushi quality is phenomenal, and is just as good if not better than the Omakase sushi from Zen, Aoyama, Solo sushi, Inaho, etc... The red shrimp was my personal favorite of the night followed by the o-toro. However, my preference is to have a more conventional Japanese omakase meal with more variety. The sushi and sashimi is great, but I miss the chawanmuchi and other delicacies that come with the omakase at a place like Solo. Also, for someone with a big appetite (like me), I was still a bit hungry at the end of the meal. However, for someone that craves sushi and sashimi only, this place is a must try! I much prefer Yasu over the new Zen. 

Overall, had an amazing dining experience at Yasu. They serve some really fantastic sushi and sashimi. But what makes the dining experience even more memorable is watching the chefs prepare the sushi in front of you. I would definitely consider coming back, once my wallet recovers..."}
{"text":"Went with my bf to celebrate our 3rd anniversary during weekends. The presentation of each dish was amazing! The best part was all the dishes are made in front of you! The seafood is so fresh and the sushi I would say it was the best sushi I have ever had! 

The restaurant only allows around 20 people to have dinner in the restaurant due to the limited space every time. Make sure you book a month in advance especially if you want to sit on the sushi bar to see the performance from the chef.

We really had a great time in this place! I would recommend to everyone! This is the restaurant you should have in your bucket! We would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Yasu is very reminiscent of JaBistro, but has better atompshere while JaBistro provides a wider selection. As the kind of person who always orders uni at sushi bars, I can say that the seafood vatiety is nothing special, but the quality might be the best and freshest you can get in Ontario and Quebec. Dinner is a set cost with an option to upgrade the first sashimi course. Doing so gets you a few extra pieces of rarer sashimi. A bit pricey but a good choice. During the meal you sit at the sushi bar and watch the chef prepare your food. You can talk to the chef or just chat with your friends. Overall a pleasant experience, and well worth the cost of admission."}
{"text":"I came here for the \"chef's selection\" and paid around $80/person before taxes for a 18-piece meal, black sesame ice cream, and the tea/water that comes with it. This is probably the best sushi that I have ever had in Toronto, and you can really taste the freshness. 

You typically have to book 2 weeks in advance, and they would only have 2 session a day. Each section houses around 14 - 16 people and it's a great spot for dates, or other special occasions.

I will be definitely coming back to Yasu in the future!

Tips:
- Be sure to ask for a bar seat so that you can see your sushi being prepared.

TL;DR: Best sushi place in Toronto. Hands down. MUST TRY!

1. Food (5/5)

This is the best quality sushi that I have ever have. The fish is so fresh!!! Not only will you be paying for the freshness, but for the experience. In front of you will be chefs that have practiced the craft for tens of years. By simply watching them handle the sushi, you can tell that what you're about to eat is something amazing. You'll also have a chance to try fish from not only locally, but around the world (Japan, Boston, etc). The black sesame ice cream that we got is also one of the best we have eaten up until this point. Truly an experience you will want to have.

2. Service (5/5)

The waiter is extremely friendly. She comes around and explains what you're about to eat before you have it, as well as the order in which you should eat it in. No complaints what-so-ever.

3. Ambiance (5/5)

You're also paying for the mood. Since they limit the number of people per session, the noise level here is extremely quiet. The mix of design and lighting also allows for some really nice pictures to post to your social media. 

------------

Overall (5/5)"}
{"text":"All time favourite omakase in Toronto. Although every time I go we get  different types of seafood but this time it was different this time we got sashimi before our sushi omakase. 

I enjoyed sitting at the bar since we got to talk to the chef and we got to see how the sushi was made. 

The difference between this experience and the last experience was instead of introducing the various types of seafood individually to each party, they sectioned the bar to three and just did a brief explanation by three.

Sometimes i wonder if it'd be nice if they had the option of omakase Sashimi as well as Sushi so for those who don't want to have carbs can have that option."}
{"text":"Best sushi I have ever had in Toronto. Great service great food alongside with great people. 

Expect the meal to take two hours to complete as they prepare all the food in front of you. The place is really small I would say it fit less than 20 people each time. Make sure you book a month in advance.

It's a bit on the pricier side but it's definitely worth it!! The whole experience was amazing. ;) 

Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"This was my first omakase experience and Yasu definitely set the bar high for me. I booked my reservation for my friends and I almost a month in advice so it's safe to say Yasu is one of the best in Toronto. 

The restaurant itself is very small with mainly seatings in front of the sushi chefs and a few tables which allowed the chefs to really talk to their customers. Everyone gets the same menu at a fixed price which comes with around 18 pieces of sushi and dessert. At first my friends and I thought we wouldn't be full since we were use to all you can eat sushi, but by the end we were stuffed!

As for the sushi themselves, the fishes came from all over the world which was amazing. The chefs prepared each sushi right in front of us and explained each type, where it came from, and even pictures of the actual fish as well. Every piece was very fresh, sweet, and savoury. You can tell that the chefs are devoted to bringing the best fishes from different areas of the world to serve to their customers.

I think omakase is something that everyone should try at least once because this experience is so much better and makes you feel like you are in Japan with their authenticity and dedication in creating each piece of sushi."}
{"text":"Went there last year for my birthday. 

After tasting some of the best sushi restaurants in NYC and having expected the restaurant to be on the same tier, I was slightly disappointed after we started the dinner. 

I would say, it's absolutely one of the top sushi restaurants in GTA. However, to make its name out of the area, it still has a long way to go.

Tips: The table seats are not extremely hard to get if you need to make an urgent reservation. However, if you're going with no more than 2 people and the main focus during the meal will be on the food, go for the bar seats (as always) and make a reservation early."}
{"text":"Best sushi I have had in Toronto and wonderful service as well. Yasu is a perfect date night destination or for a special occasion.  Prices are very good considering the quality of the food. Expertly prepared and well thought out. HIGHLY recommended."}
{"text":"Just want to say Yasu is amazing! Great food and lovely host.  

I read some of the not so good reviews and found it rather disturbing! First of all, you shouldn't be comparing Yasu to Jiro's sushi!!! Jiro's sushi has 3 Michelin Stars in Japan, I realized many of reviewers failed to mention that and you would have to be an idiot to make that comparison or even have that type of expectations!!!   

Yasu deserves his own review as his own and it's not fair to make comparison to the best of the best....Don't forget if you eat at Jiro, it'll cost you $300 USD plus/per person and he's IN JAPAN ...Yasu isn't charging that price tag so all you people need to sit down and stop complaining."}
{"text":"Just as expensive as Zen, but really, just as good sushi.  Bill came to just over $300 but man, was it worth it.  It was like heaven in your mouth.  The fish was fresh and the service was bang on.  Will be back 100%!"}
{"text":"With their highly sought after reservation and near perfect ratings, I was so excited to finally get my hands on the 'best sushi in toronto'. Unfortunately, Yasu couldn't claim that title for me.

We were seated at the small brightly lit sushi bar with only around 10 seats in total. They start serving the whole place at the same time so don't be late. The environment was pretty quiet with everyone's eyes hanging on the 3 sushi chefs every elegant move. 

The plum wine we ordered was a delicious start to the highly rated $80 omasake experience which I thought is a reasonable price point. I am a fan of the simplicity and enjoyed watching the chefs delicately create the sushi pieces like works of art. Our chef, although very polite, spoke so softly that half the time we couldn't hear the details of what we having. I did not know I ate cod testicles until after the fact.. It was a pleasant surprise.

There were for sure some delicious pieces such as the toro, monkfish liver and sweet tamago and I think it's very easy to appreciate the authenticity of the experience. Overall though, I felt the fish lacked their distinct sweet freshness and the rice missed the mark on the vinegary acidity. Wait time between each sushi was also sporadic that I got hungry in between. An interesting experience but I was far from being blown away. 

Was seriously hoping for a 'Jiro dreams of sushi' moment but it seems like a ticket to Tokyo is still the best bet."}
{"text":"Fresh delicious sushi - the hand roll with the sea eel wasn't good (it was bland and dry), but the rest was perfect. Unfortunately, the chef gave us only 17 pieces out of 18 that was on the menu, but we didn't want to say anything because we thought it would be rude. For the price, the experience is worth it, I just wish some of their sushi looked a little better."}
{"text":"The service was great, the servers were courteous and attentive. They give you a story with some of the dishes and let you know the tasting notes for the sake. It didn't manage to be intrusive as one would expect and gives you something to talk about too.

I've been to several omakase, none in Toronto have ever really captured my attention as much as Yasu. Definitely one of the top sushi places to go. 

Fish Selection (in no particular order):
Hotaru-ika
Toro
Chuu toro 
Akami
Kanpachi
Bonito
Buri
Tai
Hotate-gai
Unagi
Ikura
Tamago
Saba
Zuwai-gani
Sakura Masu
Shimaaji
Monkfish foiegras
Kuruma shrimp (not 100% sure)

My favorites of the night was the hotate, the tuna flight, Ikura, and the smoked bonito. All of the fish was fresh and prepared with great attention to detail.

My companion and I did the sake pairing, each of them were great and complemented the sushi perfectly. The volume was around 70-80mL for each glass, so you do end up drinking quite a bit, so it may be wise to share, if you cannot handle too much alcohol. 

The facilities were clean and well-kept, not a thing to complain about.

The dining room is simple and the focus is on the chefs at the bar, or if you're at one of the 2 tables, the person you're with. This makes it very pleasant and cozy. The place is small and seats a very limited number of people (typical of omakase restaurants) and they only have 3 servings per day, so make sure you make a reservation well in advance.

{"text":"CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK!!!
it's sooooo sooo good, food is good, services is good. You get 18 pieces plus dessert and you can choose to get additional pieces if you don't have enough. Even though i really want to order more, i was so full."}
{"text":"Had a very pleasant omakase experience at Yasu, but I've had it better down in the States in Seattle. Their rice was really nice, but the fish were the usuals, nothing really too spectacular. I was hoping to eat most fish imported from Japan, but it turned out that only a few were. And the price is on the pricier side for what you get (half cup of soup will cost you $5)"}
{"text":"Went in for the 'chef's selection' priced at $120/per head, which included an amazing sashimi platter and lobster broth on top of the nigiri omakase 

Ambience was fairly serious and quiet - for the full experience, it's best to sit at the bar so you can watch the chefs at work

The quality of ingredients was excellent - but the clincher was how the focus and pace of the meal encouraged me to actually think about what I was eating

Yasu turns sushi into an art form. The omakase was a dance with my taste buds that leaves me craving for more."}
{"text":"This restaurant definitely should be on everyone's bucket list! Everything was absolutely amazing! They pay close attention to every detail from the moment you walk in to the last breath you take in the restaurant. 

Luckily for us, the omakase menu recently changed to include sashimi and other special surprises in addition to the traditional nigiri. There was an amazing assortment of ridiculously fresh fish that delivered exceptional flavours. Though this experience costs $105 per person, it was worth every penny."}
{"text":"I love Sushi so much and I think this is one of the best sushi post in Toronto!!!
Great food and I love downtown and its Located downtown and I was so happy that we got to go to this place!! If you love GOOD sushi go here and don't kiss out!"}
{"text":"Came here for an early birthday celebration yesterday. I was surprised as to how small the restaurant was! We reserved the bar seats which was smart as we could see the sushi chefs work their magic.

Everything was superrrr fresh. You get 18 pieces of sushi + dessert for $80, which, in my opinion is very worth it. The food I would definitely give 5 stars for, but the service needs to be worked on, so that's where they lose the 1 star. Due to the language barrier, I couldn't really understand what they were trying to say, especially the sushi chefs. Servers weren't that attentive either, filling up our water, asking how it was etc...

Food! My favourite was the Sea Eel and Otoro. Majority of the fish was so soft that it melts right in your mouth. I also loved watching the chefs slice the fish and squishing the rice together, definitely a great show.

Oh and their bar lighting is amazing. Makes all the photos look great! 

This is probably the best sashimi I've had in toronto by far. Would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Being a connoisseur of raw fish and having been recommended Yasu by Toronto by a local couple when I was at Meadowood in Napa Valley, I was excited to be there. Overall the atmosphere of Yasu simple and causal, but still true to a Japanese sushi restaurant. Some of the ingredients used the night I was present were quite expensive with the fish was high quality and fresh.

So why 3 stars? In my opinion, sushi is more than having high quality fish. If that was the case anyone could open a sushi restaurant and be successful provided they have a good fish/seafood provider. Sushi is one of the few foods that I think needs it because of how simple it is. It is fish, rice, and whatever extras are added to it (yuzu, wasabi, etc.) and in this case the preparation was generic and at least from my observation the sushi chef was handling the fish (excessive touching) and rice (shaping) too much resulting in a less refined taste. (It actually matters if you've ever had god-tier sushi.) Furthermore, I would of loved more creativity in the rice or the additions. While I don't like making comparisons to justify ratings typically, since sushi is so simple some exceptional sushi restaurants would try to show culinary skills and cooking experience by using rice flavored or cooked differently to cater to the fish. In Yasu, it was most the same. Fish + simple rice, occasionally yuzu with a bit of overhandling. Good fish, left happy, but by the next day there was nothing memorable, which you would expect for a Japanese sushi restaurant with an omakase format, high acclaim, and the price range of $100."}
{"text":"This place has the best straight up omakase in Toronto. Everyone shows up for their reservation and we are all seated at the same time. No menu, $80, 18 pieces per person.

Get a seat at the bar so you have a view of the sushi chefs hard at work. They serve you one piece at a time, and the progression and timing of the whole meal is perfect. A server will come by and show you a picture of the fish that you will shortly consume.

I wasn't sure if i would be full after \"only\" 18 pieces...but towards the end, I was definately full....in a good way. If you're not, you can go back and re-order any of the sushi that you just had.

Honestly, we've been to Kaji, and that is an amazing menu as well...but Yasu is where you want to go if you want strictly sushi."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to Yasu for Valentine's Day dinner :) 
He booked a month in advance - so book early if you plan on visiting here!
It was amaaazing.. We agreed on coming back here again :P 
Highly recommended.

We ordered the sake pairing which comes in a set of 6:
1) Niigata prefecture sake
2) Niigata prefecture sake #2
3) Ichinokura from Miyagi, Japan
4) Yamagata prefecture sake
5) Seikyo from Hiroshima, Japan
6) Yuzu sake

CHEF OMAKASE (18 sushis in total - chef selection):

1. SEA BASS from Greece WITH UNI from Vancouver, Canada
Uni was very fresh  - a good mix with the sea bass.

2. SHINAME FLUKE from Japan
Sweet taste to it

3. MARINATED TUNA from Sri Lanka
Buttery flavour and cuts in very easily - not too much fat

4. WHITE SHRIMP from Japan
Sweet and mushy

5. SCALLOPS WITH ROCK SALTS from Hokkaido, Japan
Sweet and mushy - similar to the white shrimp but more sea-taste

6. OCEAN TROUT from Scotland
The fatty is SO GOOD :D

7. GOLDEN ICE SNAPPER from Portugal
Tail moves up when he seared it! So fresh! Not too strong of a fishy taste

8. SNOW CRAB from the East Coast
My boyfriend said he got goosebumps from eating this because he loves this so much hahaha

9. BLUE RAY MACKEREL WITH PICKLED DAIKON
Salty mackerel and daikon created a good texture and a good balance

10. IKURA handroll
One of my favourite! The roes were huge and juicy

11. STRIPPED JACK from Kyushu, Japan
Chewy and super fresh

12. MONK FISH FOIE GRAS from Boston, USA
This one is MY FAVOURITE :D - We actually ordered another set of this at the end of our meal because we loved this the most out of the 18 sushis that we've had. AMAZING :) The mint was a good mixture with the flavour - monk fish was very sweet.. loved it!

13. SEA BREAM from Greece
Less chewy version of the snapper, similar in freshness

14. OTORO from Spain
My top 5 picks of the night :)

15. BONITO from Japan
Seared part of the fish was amazing

16. TORO and SCALLOP HANDROLL from Japan
My boyfriend said it was the best handroll he's ever had in his life.. hahaha 
The sushi chef made this handroll in a very crafty way - he cut up the seaweed so that the contents would stay in tact easier

17. ANAGO from Peru
So sweet, not too much bones

18. TAMAGO
Tastes like cake

DESSERTS:
- Green tea panna cotta
- Ginger ice cream (I liked this one more)"}

Best sushi I had in Toronto 

- Tip: 
Book the seat by the window if you're planning a special intimate night."}
{"text":"Tip 1: Book a month in advance via yelp - make sure you have your credit card. They need it for the reservation. 
Tip 2: Get a bar seat - the table seats are so NOT worth it. You need to see them in action!
Tip 3: Be prepared to try new seafood

I took my husband here for his birthday last night. We were super lucky to get a bar seat where Chef Yasu was serving us. There are 3 sushi chefs, 12 bar seats, and 4 table seats. There's three seating times I believe. We went for 7:15pm and finished around 9:15pm. We ordered the tasting menu for $105 and added an additional sashimi platter per individual for $25 each. It was TOTALLY worth it! We were super full at the end of this dinner, which as a serious surprise.

Verdict: Unique foods, thoughtful and detailed chefs, and a wonderful experience.

I have been to Japan twice, and many Japanese Omakase tasting menus, including my favourite restaurant in Toronto, Sushi Kaji, and I was prepared to compare it to Yasu.

To my surprise, they are pretty different. Yasu has this unique feature where they get specialty fish from all over the world, and some are only in season for a short period of time. It makes me think Chef Yasu hand picks each fish. We tried many unique fishes here. The quality of Yasu and Kaji are on par, both amazingly fresh. Experience is similar, but I do have to say, while Kaji will always hold a special place in my heart, Yasu came out on top (ever so slightly) with it's unique menu. I also want to add that kaji does other dishes like tempura whereas yasu focuses on seafood so it's hard to compare. 

We had: 

Sashimi platter: Oyster from BC with a unique Japanese sauce, tuna from japan, bonito (seared fish), amberjack, lobster sashimi, and uni. Very nicely paired with different flavours from all the seafood. Chefs took care arranging each piece. They even grounded up fresh Japanese wasabi in front of us. 9 pieces for $25 

Tasting menu: 

1. Monkfish liver with fluke fish fin - amazing flavour. I have never had monkfish or fluke before. Google monkfish. They are scary looking!

2. Salmon Roe and fatty tuna topping rice - the roe was not too salty, paired nicely with the rice and fatty tuna.

3. Fresh live shrimp from BC - only in season for four weeks - Chef Yasu took it out live,  inspected it, and prepared it in front of us. He was so detailed, only putting a drop of soya sauce on it.

4. Fluke fish - new for me! Google it!

5. Scallop sashimi sushi - very fresh. You can taste each piece of rice and it was not too sweet.

6. Firefly squid - the servers came around with ipads showing us this firefly squid in it's natural habitat in Japan. They glow in the dark like fireflies It only lives for one year and it was in season right now. It was very good. He put a miso sauce on it, which made it sweet and flavourful. *one of my fave dishes

7. Stripe Jack fish - very unique, a new try for me

8. Sakura shrimps - crunchy and flavourful. Never had such tiny fresh shrimps. *another home run

9. Fluke fish miso soup - the chef made it in front of us. It was so good!!!

10. Three different tunas from Japan - lean, medium, and fatty belly - totally reminded me of Japan. So so so FRESH! I loved how they paired it like this so people can compare the three parts of the tuna! Exactly like how i had it in Japan.

11. Ocean Trout from Scotland - I can't tell how this is different from salmon, but it was amazing!

12. Mackerel - this was so good. Not too salty and perfectly seasoned.

13. Fresh water eel with a sweet Japanese sauce - I didn't even know there was a difference between fresh water and salt water eel! It was fried and served hot. Very good!

14. Egg sushi - very soft and sweet. It was almost like a dessert.

After this last piece, if you are still hungry, you can add extra pieces. We were super full and didn't need to add anything.

15. Dessert: Green tea ice cream with red bean topping - they added a candle for my husband because it was his birthday. *make sure you tell them when they call to confirm your reservation.

We got lucky and got to take a photo with Chef Yasu.

I really enjoyed Yasu. We paid about $350 with tax and tip. Expect to try different fishes depending on what is in season. It was definitely worth it in my books!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite omakase sushi spot! Standard omakase is 105, upgrading to the premium sashimi platter is an additional $25. If you're sitting at the bar, would recommend upgrading so you don't feel left out! 

Small, intimate restaurant with limited number of seats, and clean and minimalist design. The focus is on the fish and the nigiri (which it should be), chefs and waitresses are attentive and friendly. If you've ever watched Jiro Dreams of Sushi, it's a similar style - the chef places the nigiri at the bar and you're meant to eat it almost immediately. The fish is extremely fresh, the waitress show you photos of what they look like, and some dishes are seasonal (ie. firefly squid in the spring). 

There is no choice of what you receive, but you can notify the waitress beforehand of allergies. Personal favorites are the monkfish liver, firefly squid, and the fluke! 

Having been 1-2 times over the past year or so, I've noticed they are starting to add more dishes at the beginning (ie. sashimi platter, striped jack fish miso soup, salmon roe and negitoro on rice), which filled me up fairly quickly compared to what it used to be, of simply 18 pieces of nigiri. 

Make reservations at least 1-2 weeks in advance, and make sure to show up on time!"}
{"text":"Of the omakases I have tried in Toronto so far, Yasu is definitely at the top for me thus far. As always, the first impressions of a restaurant is the decor. Unlike other restaurants, Yasu is rather small and seats only a small number of patrons. That said, it is not a downside as you get a very intimate experience with the chefs for the duration of your meal. The restaurant has a modern theme in that it is simplistic and classy. Both times I have been, most of the seated patrons would choose to sit at the sushi bar (there are only two other tables that I have seen at the restaurant). The service staff are very efficient and friendly - they gave us warm welcomes, are quick to serve and come to each party to spotlight the seasonal sushis that are being served. 

The choice sushis that we have had so far are all very fresh. You have your main dishes such as toro, mackerel, bonito, etc. - all of which are delicious, fresh and a delight to your taste buds. Then there are the seasonal catches which have also been a pleasure to try. The chefs introduce each fish to you as they serve it and explain where is is from and what is special about them. I have had the pleasure of being served by Yasu on my second visit and watching him (and the other chefs) prepare and serve each sushi was a memorable experience in itself. They are very particular about their cuts, the presentation and the timing of each dish. I truly enjoyed myself each time I've been there and am anticipating what the next season will bring us."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed the omakase experience at Yasu. Sitting at the sushi bar watching the 3 chefs was a special and interesting experience. We started with shrimp head and enjoyed a variety of 18 pcs sushi from all around the world + black sesame ice cream. My favorites were the Stripe Jack (melt in your mouth! so interesting), Smoked Bonito (think that was the name?) and the tamago that tastes and looks like cake!

It is recommended to eat the sushi in one bite and they don't serve it with soy sauce so it's def a different experience. Some say it's overpriced and of course you can get good quality sushi at a fraction of the price, but I would recommend it for overall experience and quality with some pieces that did give me a 'wow' factor - I really could taste the difference. Although our chef did not really smile, the others looked happy and conversed with the patrons. An intimate setting recommended for dates/groups of 2."}
{"text":"Top-notch service, very elevated traditional omakase experience. We sat at the sushi bar in front of the chef and he was exceptionally attentive, describing the origin of each fish and  answering all of our questions. The best part of the experience is watching the chefs expertly craft each piece of sushi with incredible precision and expertise. 
There were many delicious items (several of which were so good that we ordered extra!), but unfortunately a few small missteps that brought my rating down from 5 stars to 4 stars. The good: all of the fish was very fresh and very delicious. A variety of flavours from clean, slightly sweet red snapper to firm (almost crunchy) aji to creamy hamachi to melt-in-your-mouth otoro to perfectly seared sweet raw shrimp. Personal favourites were the smoky, umami bonito and sweat, creamy, and intensely rich uni from Vancouver. Things I would have changed: the sushi rice was inconsistent: sometimes it was too warm and sometimes it was a tad too dry such that you could feel individual grains in your mouth (this only happened with a few pieces, but is still a consistency issue). Tamago looked and tasted like cheesecake. Ice cream dessert has clearly been through a freeze-thaw cycle, as there were large ice crystals.
I would still recommend Yasu to anyone looking for an authentic omakase experience and exceptional service; just a few small tweaks and that recommendation would be without reservation."}
{"text":"AMAZING! 18 pieces, ginger, plus ice cream dessert. Three sushi chefs and two servers for a small intimidate party."}
{"text":"Yasu specializes in Omakase sushi set course. There's normally 18 pieces of sushi, as well as dessert and tea for $80. They also have a $120 premium course with sashimi and other extra fare. 

Reservation normally has to be done weeks in advance. They ask for credit card info and full meal price will be charge if cancelled last minute. So it's important to commit! :P

We had seats at the sushi bar and was able to watch the chef preparing our meal. When each piece was served, the chef would tell us what it is, and where it is from. For some more uncommon fish types, the waitress came by and showed us photos of the fish in between courses. All the ingredients were super fresh and delicious! They 
My favorite was the toros (tuna). There were three pieces from lean to fatty, and you can really taste the difference between the fat content. The eel and uni were also very delicious! I added an additional Hokkaido uni at the end, and it just had the subtle sweetness and was so good!

Yasu is definitely worth the splurge!"}
{"text":"It's as good as everyone says it is. The idea of the true Omakase, one piece at a time seems like it's not enough, however you might feel like you've eaten a by the last piece, and if not, they offer additional pieces (for additional cost). The sake pairing was interesting, I was only served one daiginjo, the rest were regular sakes but they have a wide variety so i'd recommend trying a sake pairing once."}
{"text":"Wow, what an experience. 

Going to Japan has always been such a dream of mine, so to get a little slice of what it'll be like here on Harbord St? Amazing!

It was a 2-hour seating, with around 16 \"dishes\" which include pieces of sushi, some toro and ikura over rice, the most DELICIOUS miso soup I've ever had in my life, and of course, tamago to end the meal. They change it up based on what's in season, but if you're dying to get something they didn't offer as part of the omakase, they'll ask you afterwards if you'd like a little something extra--and chances are they'll have what you're looking for. 

The service was fantastic and I loved that it was such an intimate experience! The bar only seats 12 (If I remember correctly) and it gave us the chance to converse with the sushi chefs and the other diners and it was just such a nice time. 

Come here. TREAT YOSELF!"}
{"text":"Is Toronto ready for this?? Yasu is a brilliant sushi experience for those who appreciate the freshest sushi in a beautiful environment, served with pride, but without any high end snobbery.

Yasu is not to be confused with the dozens of all-you-can-eat sushi joints around town or other decent places. It is a masterpiece. To compare Yasu with any other sushi restaurant would be akin to confusing local graffiti with works by Jackson Pollock. It is amazingly delicious.

For 80$ you will have a filling meal of about 12 pieces of fresh sushi from all over the world (primarily Japan). You will be served fish that you have not had anywhere in Toronto on perfectly cooked rice.

If you like sushi and appreciate a delicious (albeit pricey) meal, this is your place.

{"text":"YAAAA... SUUUUU (like the Wu-Tang callout).

Okay - I agree with the majority here - this joint is dope.  The $80 eighteen-piece sushi omakase is excellent and actually surprisingly good value for money considering the ingredients and preparation.  It's purely sushi (fish on rice) in the strictest sense - so do not expect wagyu or other nonsense you may get with more expensive omakase sets.

Had to book about a month in advance for our Sunday 9:30PM seating for two of the 10 seats at the sushi bar.  I opted to just have water (the beer I wanted was sold out -- they had Japan-made Kirin Ichiban, not the Busch brewed swill!) but my guest really enjoyed the suggested sake.  They also have a sake pairing option for +$50 / person - believe it's 6 different sakes.

Service was excellent.  The place is very quiet as it's mostly silence with diners speaking in hushed tones and the chefs mostly working in silence while they ply their craft, breaking their silence when they serve you in limited English.  Despite the language barrier, service was warm with nods and smiles and the sushi chef was attentive without being intrusive.  The waiter ensured all drinks were topped up. We had one chef serving 4 people at a time and the whole experience was roughly about 90 minutes.

Overall, this was an excellent dining experience.  The pacing and slow build-up from lighter to more 'heavier' fish was well done and every item was seasoned beautifully.  Here's what we were served with some tasting notes:

1. bluefin tuna
2. amberjack - probably one of my favourite items of the night - very, very nice texture
3. seared sea bass
4. scallop
5. baby sardines
6. sea bream
7. snow crab
8. mackerel with white radish - nice move with the radish to combat the oiliness of the mackerel
9. sea urchin - one of my all-time favourites, did not disappoint
10. salmon roe
11. fluke
12. monkfish liver - 'foie gras' of the sea, decadent
13. ocean trout
14. otoro - crowd favourite, nothing much to say here
15. hay smoked bonito - the smokiness and saltiness of this really reminded me of ham
16. tuna roll - kinda of the 'filler'
17. sea eel
18. tamago - very nice way to end the meal, taste and texture was similar to sponge cake

After the meal, the chef asked us if we would like more of anything we had for or if would would like to try anything off the 'special' menu (both for extra charge).  The special menu was a mainly a selection of rare cuts of fish.  I decided to go for the baby squid (was an addition ~$7) out of curiosity and a sense of adventure - but felt perfectly sated with the regular menu (and I have a large appetite).  At the end, we had our choice of two desserts (ginger gelato or chocolate pancotta).

The only downside I can point out is that the serving tray was not cleaned throughout the service, so the sauce from the previous item may find its way to your next dish.  However, our chef was careful not to seat the sushi into any messes.

And a total nitpick from me: all dishes were presented as '[Item] from [Exporting Region]' (i.e. 'Sea Bream from Greece' or 'Uni from BC', many items being from Japan/Europe).  I understand that some people are curious and it 'adds value' in the mind of the customer - but it seems unnecessary for me.  I trust you are sourcing the ingredients appropriately - no need to 'sell' me.  In addition, most high-test seafood is graded anyways and 'imported' doesn't necessarily mean 'better' - I used to get annoyed at Vancouver sushi bars that would brag about sourcing their items from Tsukiji Market in Tokyo... when some items are actually best sourced from west coast Canada/US (i.e. uni).

Overall, it's definitely a spendy dinner - but still good value for money.  The quality is definitely on par with my expectations.  Will definitely return."}

{"text":"Omg, best sushi I've ever had. The entire dining experience is exquisite! 

Boyfriend took me there for my birthday and we enjoyed every bite of sushi we were served. Can't even pick favourites because all 18 pieces were so good. 

The restaurant is small but cozy with nice counter seating and the service is great. You get a front row seat to the action and watching the chef make sushi is fascinating. 

If you're a foodie, you must try this place."}
{"text":"Doubtless the best Omakase sushi in Toronto. 
The only downside (however pretty obvious) is that most of the fish is actually from Mexico/Europe, some had a very fishy taste.
In terms of authenticity I think this is a 'fusion' Omakase because of the different fish used from traditional Japanese sushi due to unavailability in North America. 
Every piece comes with Wasabi and Soy sauce so there isn't much variation in tasting - although I would assume the only reason every piece is covered in savoury soy sauce taste is to overcome the REALLY fishy taste from the Mexican / Portuguese fish.
I gave 5 stars because of the service and good Sake pairing. You actually need to chug some sake to get rid of the fishy aftertaste on your taste bud. 
This is a good entry-level Omakase outside of Japan , without the steep price either.

--

Forgot to mention - on the weekend that we went to this place, me and my husband drove over to J-town up in Markham and Taro fish market in North York as well - both place had EXACTLY the same selection of fish from Yasu. I would suspect that they had the same suppliers or Yasu just bought the stuff from either of the 2 places.
Cost us around $50 to purchase the fish we liked from the previous day tasting (definitely NO PORTUGUESE SARDINE EVER) and made a homemade Chirashi Don and had WAY MORE FISH than the Omakase at Yasu. 
So for people who can make an easy at-home Japanese Chirashi Don and live closer to those two stores, I would recommend getting the fish and make yourself a tasty treat at home - the fish are just as fresh and no hassle for reservation."}
{"text":"I have been to Yasu 4 times and all experience are very impressed!  That's why I come back again and again.  The new sashimi plate for $25 definitely worth the price.  A must add on for the first time visit.  The omakase price increased from 80 to 105 now, but I still believe the price is acceptable especially when compare to quality and service to Zen.  Remember to leave some room for the ice cream.  Just a reminder that extra piece at the end does cost extra $8-10 per piece!

Yasu is always my favourite omakase location"}
{"text":"Had to rate this more severely, because it was pretty expensive. I've been privileged to try many delicious omakase in the past that this experience was just at par.

Managed to get a seat by the sushi bar and watch the itamae-san at work. Found the additional $25 sashimi presentation haphazardly plated. Not sure why, but just felt it lacked heart, because by omakase standards, each piece would had been cut and placed 1 by 1 onto your plate/wood block. Also would like to mention that the small rectangular plate should had been wiped of residual soy sauce to prevent flavour contamination that may ultimately change the flavour of the next piece of nigiri. But alas, they didn't do this. 

The quality of fish were quite fresh, and it was nice to know where the fish came from. The tuna from Mexico, I found out later was actually the Pacific Blue Fin Tuna, which is an endangered species due to being over-fished with its population dropping 97% since last year. While it was nice, I don't think I will ever have it again--will choose more ethically sustainable fish carrying forward.

Not sure if times have changed since last year, but one must mention that there were several pieces broken pieces served--sushi chefs in Japan would find it heart-wrenching, because sushi is considered an art and the chef the artist. To serve guests flawed pieces of food means to taint one's masterpiece which isn't acceptable. 

Finally the big reason why I was met with disappointment was the fact I found thin piece of hair in the anago covered in the kabayaki sauce. Anyway, emailed the establishment and was told it was from their marinating brush because their chefs wear hats. Yes, while I am sure precautions may have been taken, it doesn't eliminate the fact that it may have come from another source; accidents do happen. In any event, the hair was too long to be of that sort, but I won't contest. Do check your nigiri and bring it to the staff's attention (or you'll end up kicking yourself like me for not letting them know sooner.)

All that to say, Yasu was good but nothing extraordinary. It was quite pricey, but a nice treat for special occasions--came here for our anniversary. Will we return? Maybe, just not any time soon.

*ETIQUETTE* 
Also, don't be a \"D\" and talk on your cellphone during the experience like the scrub seated next to me. It is considered very rude, and a big slap to the chef's face. If it were me, I'd kick you out. Just don't be a \"D\" :)

{"text":"One of our favourite sushi restaurants in the city. It has been a couple of years since we have been here, and the food and service is still amazing. They offer sushi omakase and sashimi as an option to your dinner.  A small restaurant that seats 12 people at the sushi bar, and I believe there is a 4 and 2 table seater available. Definitely make reservations before going. I believe they have 2 dinner time options. On our last visit this is what we had:

Lobster sashimi from Nova Scotia and Scallop sashimi from Hokkaido (one of our faves of the night)
Cod testicles from Japan (very different)
Fatty tuna from Mexico and Salmon Roe from Alaska (another favourite)
Spanish Mackarel from Florida (it was so much lighter than the saba, really good)
Cured Fluke from Japan
Uni from Boston
Amberjack (aka shimaaji)  from Japan (it is the best, great flavour and texture)
Snow crab legs with liver from Nova scotia
Shimaaji soup (so flavourful)
Lean, medium, and fatty Tuna from Mexico (amazing)
Mackerel from Iceland with pickled and grated ginger 
Fresh Water Eel from Hiroshima
Steamed egg sushi

Last dessert was sesame ice cream to end the delicious night"}
{"text":"I was a little nervous coming here as it received a lot is hype online and I was wondering if it would be on par with Zen sushi or Kaji. Some have gone as far as comparing it to Japan standards. 

This place is tucked away from the major streets of downtown and has a very modern design inside. The waitress was very friendly and would occasionally come around to explain what fish you're eating and make small conversation with you. In my opinion, I personally prefer the sushi rice more at Zen due to texture and flavour, and the seaweed is WAY better at Zen. The seaweed/nori here lacks the crisp and taste that Zen has. Nonetheless, the fish here was very fresh and delicious. When it came down to star rating, I docked a star due to personal preference of sushi rice and the Nori. 

For $80 I would rather go to Zen as it's $65 there for an omakase instead. However, if I lived closer to the downtown area, this would definitely be a great alternative."}
{"text":"I cannot think of another place in Toronto which offers the intimacy and theatre of Yasu.     Watching the chefs create each piece of sushi is almost hypnotic with the elegance of their seemingly coordinated movements.  

As someone who often uses sushi as a vehicle for a shocking amount of wasabi, the delicateness of  each piece really enabled me to appreciate the flavour subtleties of each piece of fish.  

We were exposed to new fish, the jack fish and cod sperm (forget the real name, but that is what it is) we're the most memorable.  

Service is good, not overly polished but that was fine.   

The black sesame ice cream at the end was fantastic.  

We ordered a bottle of wine but probably wouldn't bother if we went again, I didn't find the sushi enhanced by it in any way"}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical at first because coming from Vancouver, I feel like sushi in Toronto isn't as good (I know I'm a tad biased) But with $80 dollars for a person it was AMAZING. The combinations were amazing for example, Scallop with pink Himalayan pink salt and yuzu sauce. I've never had this combination before and the flavours balanced itself great. It's a bit pricey so might only come back if there's a special occasion. Check for last minute cancellations! Sometimes if you check on the site there might be some late 9:30pm bookings available :)"}
{"text":"Food: 5/5
Service: 5/5
Location: 5/5

Highlight: The overall experience was truly one-of-a-kind. Took sushi to a whole new level. Being able to watch the masters at work further enhanced the delicate flavours presented throughout the night. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. 

After tax and tip I paid $100 for 18 pieces and dessert, but if you order drinks or more pieces (they give you the option of choosing to purchase your favourite pieces a la carte), expect to pay more. 

The sitting was coordinated by 2 chefs - around 10 people per sitting, with only 2 sittings per night. With such a small number of people being served at a time, the experience felt very intimate and tailored. The food was outstanding. As a sushi lover I loved the pieces that you don't usually find at all you can eat and lower-end places. The sweet shrimp, raw scallop sushi, and roasted eel hand roll were my favourites. The shrimp was so fresh that it was still wriggling when it came to the table. 

I assume the menu is determined by the availability and seasonality of the seafood, therefore every experience you have here will likely be slightly different. If you're adventurous with your food and are willing to dish out a pretty penny for a special meal - YASU is definitely a place you need to try."}
{"text":"I went to Yasu last night to celebrate my fiancee's bday, we sat at the sushi Bar in front of Chef Yasu San. 
It was an incredible experience, Yasu Omakase it's fantastic, 18 bites of the freshness fish. 
My favorites....uni (sea urchin), negitoro and the rare bioluminescent squid (it was like tasting the ocean).
The service were very attentive to the guests, they explained every particular kind of fish also showing us the picture from a tablet."}
{"text":"First time dining here and it was also my first time having omakase - it was an amazing experience that everyone should try out!
18 piece course and dessert. They serve a very aromatic and well made matcha green tea to accompany your dinner and the waitress was always there to refill your empty cup.
We were seated by the window so did not get a chance to sit at the bar, but the waitress brought our food 2 pieces at a time and explained what each one was and from where. 
Was not disappointed with any of the sushi that were served up - absolutely fresh and creatively made.

They try to wait until everyone is seated (total of  about 18 seats) before they start the course - which I would recommend that everyone should try to arrive on time!
Parking in the area is hard to find on a friday night so plan for some extra time."}
{"text":"I was treated to Yasu for my birthday and enjoyed it tremendously. To start with, you must plan this well in advance. They accept reservations up to a month ahead. To ensure the sitting you want (on Saturdays, when we went, they have 5:15, 7:15, 9:30), book as early as you can.
We sat at the bar, and  I highly recommend it. You get to see the food being made and interact with the chefs by sitting at the bar. 

The drink choices are 4 beers and a variety of wines. Although my partner and I had green tea (which was constantly refilled, a big plus!) and water. 

The only choice to be made food-wise is the standard sashimi or the upgraded version. For our meal, the standard was 2 types of sashimi while the upgraded was 6. The sushi was as fresh as I've ever had and the presentation was incredible. In addition to sushi, one of the courses was rice with fatty tuna and salmon roe. Another non-sushi course was miso soup.
I'd had fish I'd never heard of and parts of those fish which I didn't even know were edible, such as milt. 
The meal was finished with two more pieces of a la carte sushi (which the chefs kindly offered) and black sesame ice cream. 
While the price was very high, it was a special occasion and well worth it."}
{"text":"Yasu does many things right and I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here on a date night with hubby.  But Yasu fell short on a few expectations and I had to take a star away for the following reasons.  

1.  They give you disposable wooden chopsticks you get from any take out joint.  We were not provided with hand towels so we could eat with our hands.  
2.  I know it's omakase and we were given the option to request for more or less wasabi but it would still have been nice to have some at the table alongside the ginger.
3.  A few of the sushi tasted under-whelming at best.  See below for comment.

With that said, my review breaks down like this. 
Ambiance: 5 
Service: 5
Food:  3.5
Overall experience: 4

Yasu is very intimate and that was perfect for our date night.  I loved the fact that there is limited seating and we felt free to chat and giggle at our own table which was 1 of the only 2 available at the restaurant.  The rest of the folks at our seating time sat at the bar as we enjoyed the intimacy of our small table with banquet style seating and watched the chefs work from afar.  

We both opted for sake pairing option (addtional $50 pp) which provides you with 5 different sakes to compliment the courses.  We are not sake connoisseurs by any means but we were super smitten with the Dassai 50 they served as the first glass.  Rest of the sake were good as well but Dassai 50 is now on my shopping list.  

The list of fish we were served were almost identical as Lisa C's (with the exception of the snow crab) so I won't go into a detailed list here again.  We enjoyed most of the fish served that night but the Cod soft roe, uni from both coastlines, perfect salmon roe were that stars of the show, although the nori that accompanied the salmon roe was a little too thick for my liking.  

The striped jack, we were told were very rare in North American Japanese restaurants.  Although the fish was excellent quality, I did not feel that it would be a favorite for me even if it were offered widely in other Japanese restaurants in Toronto as there was a mildly fishy tasting finish.  I preferred the amber jack as it tasted less fishy in comparison.  

However, the real disappoint was the shrimp and the monk fish liver.  I felt the charring on the red shrimp was too over-powering for the fresh sweet shrimp and really failed to enhance the sushi as the charring was all we could taste.  The monk fish liver also suffered similar fate as the shiso leaf in the sushi was too strong for me to enjoy the creaminess of the liver.  

The rest of the fish, in my humble opinion, were just fine.  Very fresh, yes.  But I expected more unusual variety of fish which was not the case.  

Perhaps best thing about Yasu's sushi, and my favorite thing about the sushi that night other than the freshness of the fish, was the rice.  Their sushi rice is second to none as the delicate balance between sweet and sour has been so finely achieved, that it elevated all their sushi to to a totally sublime level.  

Overall, the food was good, the service and the ambiance was excellent.  Would I return to Yasu?  Maybe.  But I really want to re-try Zen at their new location first."}
{"text":"This was an astonishing meal. I definitely recommend the option with premium sashimi, it was worth its cost. The fish was extremely tasty, superbly cut and presented. I think this is possibly the second-best sushi I ever had outside Japan (and actually better than many nondescript Japanese joints).

I will definitely be back if I am in Toronto again."}
{"text":"Wowzers!

This place is amazing. There was a grand total of twelve guests in this restaurant. There are only two tables... That explains why it's so hard to get a reservation. But I'm so very glad that we got a reservation and went tonight. I like that the restaurant was small and everyone started and ended their meals at the same time. I think it's great because then all the guests are treated roughly the same; and I should note that the staff was great!

Now onto the food! Every piece of the eighteen pieces of sushi was simply amazing. I've never had a striped jack piece of fish before tonight. Now I can't get the taste out if my mind.... Hold on... I'm going to need a minute before I can continue this review...

Ok. Let me continue. The cod milt was interesting. The red snapper and the yellow tail were great! But I have to say the highlight of the night was the yuho (\"rhythm of the centuries\").  It goes with the blue fin tuna soooo well. We ended the meal with black sesame ice cream and some tea. It was the perfect ending to such a harmonious menu. 

I'd definitely come back again, assuming I can get a reservation any time soon. Can't wait!!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience, would definitely go again! One of the top Sushi restaurants in Toronto, and the price is quite reasonable; $80/pp for a 18 sushi dish meal, and at the end you can pay extra to try something again or something that wasn't on the menu! Definitely pay the few extra to try what's in season, we had the golden ice snapper, very tasty!

Like what others said, book in advance at the bar seat (not the table!)"}
{"text":"I feel like a thief! To all my New York friends.   18pcs plus home made black sesame ice cream uhhhh yes please... $80CAD that's give or take $65USD?! For Omakase this is a must visit if you're in Toronto.  The price is a steal compared to the prices in Manhattan and the sushi is just as good, comparable to many good jap (not the best in New York ofc) And if you have ANY doubt look at the price just look at it...Great value.   Recommend to come with 2 people or max max 4 people bcs the place is small and only ofc only sit at the sushi bar otherwise as we all know it's wasted Omakase experience if you aren't.   I look forward to visiting again.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"One of the most unique restaurants in Toronto.  The experience in itself was spectacular, not to mention the top quality sushi and the presentation of each dish.
Plan your visit well in advance as they fill up very quickly!"}
{"text":"Overall, it was great sushi but it wasn't the best I've had. 
I drove through rush hour traffic and made it just before our reservation time, 6pm. I was a bit annoyed that people were coming in late and our group actually ended up starting at 6:20pm ish. 
Food is fresh and service is great, but I wasn't blown off by it. It is definitely always interesting to watch the chefs hard at work to create the best food but it is a bit too slow for an impatient girl like me lol. And I think a lot of the lower-rated reviews here complain about the portion. You can't expect to get full from the omakase itself but you can order extra after the set at a surcharge. 
I think I had higher expectations for this place since I had to book almost 2 weeks in advance... Regardless, it was a memorable time."}
{"text":"Amazing. This place has no menu. It's all about the Omakase with an option to add sake pairing for extra $$. Let the chef create magic for you. The fish was high quality, Fresh and delicious. You need to call weeks ahead for reservations.  Ask to sit at the counter.... Trust me. This is such a great restaurant. 10/10"}
{"text":"I don't want to sound like a broken record so I will keep this review brief. My pal and I needed to a restaurant to go to for our annual Christmas dinner. After reading about (and hearing) great reviews of Yasu, it was a no brainer - our dinner was going to be here.

Reservations are a must because of how small the restaurant is- there are 8 seats at the counter and 2 by the window. There are two dinner times - 6:30 and 8:30. You can easily make reservations online, but based on my experience, do it early so you get the day that you really want.

The concept is really cool. Our sushi chef was very personable; I also enjoyed watching how he would slice fish with his knife so beautifully and make the sushi rice in a perfect rectangle. 

The food is fresh and very good! I can't wait to return again.

Good for: night out, celebrations, sushi"}
{"text":"Yasu is a very small but chic Japanese omakase-style restaurant, where the chef picks out your sushi for you. We made an appointment a week in advance for 5 pm, and unfortunately we didn't get to sit at the bar area where the chefs make the food in front of your eyes. It was a full house on a Friday night, and we left the restaurant a little after 7 pm.

We ordered two glasses of sake, about $15 each, and the food was served up a bit on the slow side. The waiters and waitresses would describe each sushi to us, and usually you're supposed to eat from the left to the right, but sometimes the waiters would mix up the order and just give it to each of us in different directions. 

The food is sublime! As this is my first omakase-style restaurant, I don't have much to compare it with, but I am an avid fan of Japanese food so I had an enjoyable time. I docked off a star because the waiters' accents were quite thick, so sometimes I couldn't understand their description of the food at all. As well, the food was served slower to us compared to the guests sitting at the bar area.

Oh well! I would come back for a special occasion. For two people it cost around $220, so your bill will be quite costly."}
{"text":"4.5 stars (okay, maybe 4.75)!!

Amazing food and great service. Food was definitely 5 stars!

The flavours meshed so well, the rice was loose and perfect, the wasabi wasn't overpowering and even the ginger was pickled enough so that the spiciness of it was practically gone. 

The food and service seem to be quite consistent after reading the different reviews. The service was great, very attentive. I never had to ask for more water as they would just automatically notice. Mind you, there were only 9 customers at the time and two waitresses. 

The chefs serve each piece of sushi to each person individually and tells you what it is that you're eating. They also ask about any food allergies at the beginning. I didn't know that they served tea until we were almost done eating, so I had asked for water.  You can also order other alcoholic drinks, such as beer, wine, and sake (for which they have pairings). Halfway through the meal, they mention that you're half-way done. I was so sad at this point because I didn't want it to end..ever!

At the end of the meal, they mention that if you're still hungry, you can order individual pieces. They didn't mention how much each piece would be, so it would've been useful to know. You're also served a small dessert, such as ginger ice cream or chocolate panna cotta.

I also wish they had explained more about the different types of fish that were served. At first, the waitress showed us a photo of the first fish we were having (striped jack), which I thought was very cool, so I was expecting that for all of the dishes, but that didn't end up happening. At least the chef told us the name of each fish as he served it though.

Further, if you come here, don't expect to be completely full. This restaurant is for the experience and the opportunity to taste a variety of fresh fish available around the world.

I was definitely in sushi heaven for the two hours at Yasu, and would love to come back on a special occasion!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi bar i've been in Toronto. They fly in the fish daily from across the world. you get to try fish from Japan, Norway, West Coast, all over the world. Need to book ahead of time ~1 month, reservations only. I believe they do 2 dinner seatings.
The chef make the food right in front of you, you try one dish at a time. It's delicious!!!! would definitely go back"}
{"text":"YASU was my first omakase experience and after hearing great reviews and seeing all the pictures, I had high expectations for both the restaurant and omakase in general. We came in on a Sunday night at the 9:30pm slot with reservations and it was still a full house, so reservations are probably either required or highly recommended (we had reservations). I understand there is a penalty for late cancellations 

We sat at the bar infront of the 3 sushi chefs, which I highly recommend as you get to watch them prepare your sushi in awe. Our sushi chef appeared to be the lead / head sushi chef and was fantastic. He clearly explained each piece of sushi to us and was kind and smiled to us throughout.

We ordered the omakase experience at $105 and added the sashimi special for an extra $25 - pricey.

My favourites were the toro (tuna), stripe fish, shrimp, and the sashimi platter (which I think was worth the extra money).

Overall, a great and I'd recommend YASU to anyone looking for a premium omakase experience in the city."}
{"text":"Yasu proves their spot as top Omakase dining experience in Toronto! There is an option of regular ($105/person) or premium ($130/person) for omakase - comes with sashimi, sushi and dessert. The difference is the sashimi served and all else are the same. We decided to go with the premium, and we have no regrets - everything was so fresh and delicious!

I love how Yasu takes time to introduce every single piece, making sure you know what you are eating and where the seafood came from. (Service is simply amazing!) I kind of wish I made more notes, but this review would have to go off on my memory. Below are my TOP PICKS for the premium omakase experience (Dec 05, 2017):

- SASHIMI PLATTER (premium): My top 3 were the uni from Japan, the scallops and the oyster. You can really taste the freshness and sweetness of the seafood (I'm getting hungry just thinking about it...)
- FISH ROE AND UNI DONBURI: This was just unforgettable for me! The uni was very creamy, and it tasted amazing mixed with the rice and fish roe.
- MISO SOUP: This was simple yet so bold in flavours, brewed with fish bones
- SNOW CRAB WITH CRAB LIVER: The snow crab was so so sweet, and the crab liver was extremely flavourful and not fishy(?). 
- MACKEREL SUSHI: This was from Iceland and it was wrapped with a thin slice of radish to balance off the taste of the fish

FYI - This is a small location so make sure to book a reservation either on yelp or call in! Reservations are opened 1 month in advance of the day you are trying to book for. There is an option of table or bar seat so it's up to your preference. All in all, would I ever come back? Definitely (but I need to start saving up first... LOL :p)"}
{"text":"The food is melt in your mouth fresh and the cooks are amazing. I had heard about these places in Japan so I am so happy to finally exprience it here.  My only thisn is that the ambiance was a bit too quiet.. but again, it is about the food!!!! soooooo amazing. a must go."}
{"text":"Likely the best sushi and sashimi I've had outside Japan. You must arrive on time and the omakase style menu means you eat what the chef serves. Not for picky eaters, but such a treat to anyone with a love of fresh fish!!"}
{"text":"Finally - a great, authentic omakase experience downtown!! Kaji is excellent and I have heard wonderful things about Hashimoto, but both are far from accessible by transit. Yasu is right on the Harbord strip, steps from the Spadina streetcar. It is also very reasonable for $80 -- it's a lot of food and they use very high quality fish flown in from abroad (mostly Japan, some from Portugal -- follow them on twitter or FB to see what fish they have chosen as it rotates every month or two). Unlike Kaji it is all sushi here, so don't expect any cooked food, noodles, etc. They do some nice desserts - a matcha panna cotta and black sesame gelato on my visit. 

I went on a Tuesday night for the 8:30pm seating and ended up having a private dining experience with my DC! It was great but I am trying to spread the word so they get busier too! They have been open since May. 

I can't add much considering Karen L.'s two detailed reviews! It's 10 seats and it's all bar seating overlooking the kitchen. This is great if you enjoy watching the sushi chef at work. I loved watching him cut the fish so delicately and assemble the sushi with such care. Everything was flavourful and delicious. The scallop and the monkfish liver with shiso were particularly memorable. The chef is soft-spoken but happy to talk about the food and tailor things to your preferences. 

Our server was attentive and polite. She kept our tea cups full and all the staff are very interested in ensuring customers have a great experience so that they will return! 

Music choice was... interesting. David Guetta and Bob Sinclair hits -- I didn't mind it, although seems a little incongruent with the ambiance:P"}
{"text":"Yasu was a really great experience for me. I appreciate some of the things other reviewers say, when comparing this place to other omakase restaurants, but it's still a very refined, elegant and elevated sushi experience. I got to try three different pieces of tuna, firefly squid, super-fresh uni and various other kinds of fish from all over the world. The presentation was refined and delicate, and sitting by the chef at the bar was fascinating. 

If you've never done omakase before, this place is really approachable and affordable. Book a weeknight reservation at least a week in advance, and there won't be any trouble getting a seat. And if you've done omakase before, it may not be the same as other places you've visited, but it's still a lovely experience :)"}
{"text":"You get to eat fishes from different parts world.

Today, Yasu took my stomach to Peru, Sri Lanka, Japan, Sweden, Vancouver, and many other more places, I can't remember.  Lolz...

If you want to experience fishes at it's finest, then this is the place to go.  18 pieces of Sushi, I think was the number we had for $80 + dessert afterwards (not too memorable, but who cares, I came here for the sushi).    At first I thought, 18 pieces of sushi would be too little, but because they are all sushi (with rice) and not sashimi, it was actually pretty filling.  Everything tasted unique in a non-traditional way.   

Sushi Kaji used to be my ONLY favourite Japanese restaurant, now there is another contender.  Except, Yasu is much closer to me than the latter.  So,  yay to that.

They only take reservations.  So, be sure to reserve for the bar seats area because they're the best seats.  However, they do have a table seating for two by the window.  Ok, if you want a little privacy.  But still, sitting at the bar is better for the \"experience.\""}
{"text":"If Toronto had a Michelin star restaurant, this would be it. It's an intimate gathering of ~20 people in every seating. Approx 2 hours of the finest sushi in Toronto. Would recommend getting the premium sashimi platter. Loved all of it and highly recommended."}
{"text":"We did the omakase. Definitely worth it. The uni from Japan is super delicious, I wish I could stay in toronto a bit longer"}
{"text":"After close to a 2 month wait, Jiro style omakase dinner was nothing short of amazing. It was a theatrical experience. Chef Yasu is definitely giving my all-time favourite, Sushi Kaji a run for the title, Best Sushi Restaurant in Toronto. Without the time to travel the world for good sushi, this is the next best thing, IMO. Fresh fish and seafood that I've never had the chance to try from all over the world; Japan, Spain, Boston, Alaska, Norway, Beirut, and Vancouver. Our favourites were the scallops and sea urchin from Japan! Heaven.

All of this for $80 per person, which includes 16 -18 pieces of sushi plus dessert. A deal if you ask me.

Note: After the meal, you have the chance to order more. Our scallops and uni sushi were $16 a piece.
Reservations: A must
Parking:  Street parking
Hours: 6:00 PM - 11:00 PM"}
{"text":"I totally love Yasu. I brought some visiting family here for what I expected and hoped to be an amazing omakase experience. Success! The rave reviews that YASU has received elsewhere are well deserved. Our experience was like a tour of the world's seafood bounty. 

We had fish from Japan, Scotland, Norway, Chile, to Canada's Atlantic and Pacific coasts and beyond. The intimate setting of the space was perfect and the staff and omakase chef were a pleasure to interact with. 

I highly recommend the sake pairing for the full experience. Totally worth it! Book well in advance in order to secure a seat at the bar. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My parents had an anniversary dinner and we decided to go to Yasu. We were expecting to get a similar service we always get and Sushi Kaji or Shinobu but this was not the case. It was a major accident right in front of our house and police closed the street so I called the restaurant and I told them that we will be there at 6 and if its ok instead of the 5pm reservation. Keep it mind it was 3:30 when I called them. Waiter said it will be no problem. We came at the restaurant at 6 and I told that my mom and brother are parking it will take a few minutes. The waiter came back and said that we would need to leave by 7 and they will give us remaining of the food on a take out. We drove exactly for 3 hours from Maple because of the accident and would never do it knowing that we have less than hour to eat. I told the waiter that then we would need to leave and I asked him to tell their manager to call us back. Instead of that they charged my dad's credit card for $300 and never called us. I have been in many high end restaurant around the world, but this is worst ever experience I had. It been a week since and no one even called me. I will try to speak to a manager or owner one more time and if this would not work ill seek a legal advice. Its not about the $300 , they ruined the occasion and we drove for 3 hours to the restaurant and for one hour back."}
{"text":"Let us get the negative out of the way for indeed the negative aspects are very real and present.
1- Reservation requires a credit card with the provision that you will be charged if you are a no-show or try to cancel past their deadline. So the experience does not begin kindly or politely. Yes, money talks in this world, but service wins customers more.
2- The atmosphere, sign outside, decoration and system are not Japanese. It is an austere setting.
3- The set dinner times are untraditionally harsh. You have to leave by a certain time as they are sitting the next merry-go-round and you cannot enter even a couple of minutes before your seating because they are not ready for you. of course, it is reservation only and there is not any other option. People huddle outside until they are allowed in. 
Yes, nothing so far about this restaurant is Japanese!

There is not a menu at Yasu. You get a set course pre-determined by the restaurant (omakase); however, they ask about allergies and are cool enough to offer you substitutions and extra nigiri for additional charge at the end.

Most importantly, however, the sushi was excellent and on par with Toronto's best. Hard to imagine the owner, who was not present the night we went, used to operate a takeout sushi joint. This is authentic sushi presented by trained Japanese folk and unlike the other sushi joints in the area and so half the customers were Chinese-Canadian. A lady next to us was Japanese and was spoken to in her mother tongue by the chef Ken who has been living here for 14 years.
The night started with the chef's recommendation that sushi be eaten in one bite (who remembers Mikado?). Also, the wasabi (actual wasabi not the powder crap) and soy sauce are applied by the sushi chefs so this is not the place for those people who like to pour a saucerful of soy sauce and mix pretend wasabi in it. 

Here is what was served:
Hotate from Hokkaido
Kani (with kanimiso which is the innards of the crab which was my first time) from Kumamoto, Japan
Negitoro (in an original cute nori square)
Ankimo (monkfish liver) with sweet daikon (my first time with this combination)
Shimaaji from Ehime, Japan where one of the waiters came around with a picture of an Aji fish on a tablet
Shimaaji from Portugal
Akaebi from Argentina whose slightly bitter taste was a lowlight (then again it was a shrimp)
Chutoro, otoro and akami, which are three parts of the same fish, were served together like a tuna train with the last one being zuke or marinated 
Ikura
Two kinds of uni (from the East Coast and Vancouver) and the Eest Coast one being better
Kanpachi from Kagoshima, Japan
Shimesaba
Hay smoked Katsuo (my first time having hay smoked bonito)
Anago, which was falling apart
Tamago, which was so smooth and linear I thought they had cut Castella cake
As a bonus we requested kinmedai aburi...

The fish was excellent, the cuts superb, the cutting superior and only the slightly coarser rice and slightly smaller nigiri left something to be desired. This was a 9/10 experience and for the quality and quantity of 18 pieces the value is the best in town. Thankfully, they are not charging customers a lot.

The chefs were experts, polite, explaining things, friendly and not pretentious (this was the best part after the fish!) either. The washroom was clean.

Yasu is a clear instance of a restaurant that one would revisit."}
{"text":"Meh. I liked some things; I disliked some things. Perhaps I'm not that cultured an eater. It was a special meal, for sure, and it's special to eat fish flown in from other countries, but the food was not justified by the price tag, in my opinion. For very high end sushi, I think I prefer Sushi Kaji."}
{"text":"I came not knowing what to expect. I've been to a few of these types of Japanese dinners - omakase, the sake pairing was really good. I can't even decide OMA favorite as the majority of picks were amazing. A few that I remember- the smoked bonito, the tuna and toro, mackerel, and egg were AMAZING. I would definitely go with the sake paring. The Dasai 50 and the plum wine were my favorite. They ran out of nigiri tonight which was too bad. 
Move talk a great meal. Way cheaper than going to Kaji."}
{"text":"You can definitely taste the freshness, the preparation and ingredient uses enhanced the fish well. A couple of \"unique\" sushi that I've never tried before, which is quite a unique experience. Everything was made of high quality. A new level of Tamago was experienced; it was almost like a light sponge cake.  Service was great!"}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience here...not saying it was perfect but I look forward to coming back.

We arrived a bit earlier than our reservation and saw some people waiting outside the door. Seems like the door wasn't open. We walked around and came back couple minutes before the reservation time and was seated.

Our server took our drinks order and they came quickly. The whole omakase experience then begins. Two peices were served each time except for the tunas. I have to say the selection was amazing and fish was fresh. Slightly disappointed at the size of the fish compared to other omakase places. 

Yasu serves everyone together in the restaurant, so the pace is dependent on everyone in the restaurant. I am a relatively fast eater and I did have to wait quite a bit for certain plates to come.

Lovely experience here. Will be back."}
{"text":"Made reservations 3 weeks in advance and managed to get a seat at the sushi bar even though it was a saturaday 9:30 pm time slot. The entire meal lasted almost 2 hours. 
The regular omakase is $105, we got the added sashimi plate for $25 per and was decently worth it. 
The entire restaurant seats less than 20 people so be on your best behavior.
Everything was pretty great except a more inexperienced server who made a few mistakes but thats ok."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary and wow were we amazed! Going from AYCE to experiencing Omakase is as mind-blowing as you can just imagine. We thought the 18 pieces + dessert were definitely worth the price. You could taste the freshness in the quality of the raw fish and each piece complemented the next. Our chef was very friendly and was very thorough in making sure to explain each piece to each person. Our favourites would be the fatty tuna, sea scallop and the 3-piece tuna. We were pleasantly surprised by the egg, it tasted like a Japanese cheesecake. The black sesame ice-cream completed the entire meal for us, it was extremely rich in creaminess and flavour. We would definitely recommend this place and will be coming again in the near future!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review with great difficulty. First time I'm giving a 3 star review for a restaurant that I really enjoyed the food. Why  3 stars? The only option to dine here is the set menu in which we were ok with but after a $300 meal me and my wife were still very hungry. If it was only me I wouldn't right this review. My wife who weighs $105lbs was starving. The fact that we left and went around the corner to Cora to get a slice of pizza seems so wrong."}
{"text":"i'm a fan of traditional, high-end nigiri served omakase style. My review is geared towards like-minded diners.

Based purely on taste, I give this place 4 stars. On Toronto's high-end nigiri circuit,  it's a step below JaBistro, and similar to Zen and Kaji. Some pieces were a bit underwhelming and ultimately lacking the umami finish that we're all looking for. 

Other considerations:
- The fact that everyone in the restaurant is served the same piece at the same time and sitting at the sushi bar is fun. 
- The sushi actually a decent value - you get 18 pieces + a dessert for $80. 
- Unfortunately, the least expensive sake option is a $50 bottle, or a $50 sake pairing (per person)."}
{"text":"I don't think this restaurant needs anymore raving because everyone knows it's amazing!! If you don't believe us, go and try it out yourself  just make sure you call and book in advance. Prepare to be wowed."}
{"text":"We booked our table one month earlier and it worth the waiting. The menu is set by the chief and it can only hold around sixteen people at one time. The sashimi is so fresh and tasty. Hope to try it again"}
{"text":"Yasu has recently increased their Omakase menu by $25 CAD and added a sashimi plate for $25 CAD as well.  At $80 this place had incredible value but does the increase in price equate to an improved experience?  Short answer... yes!  It's hard to quantify experience to dollars.  I would say that the increase isn't exactly linear.  So here's what I think is different.  First, the quality of fish has improved.  There is a marked difference in the quality of sushi.  Additionally, Yasu has also added a bit more to their repertoire by adding in a mid-course soup and straying slightly from a 100% nigiri menu.  What you end up with is a more diversified sushi experience with better quality fish.  I'll still look to revisit Yasu when I can but if you haven't tried their updated menu I'd say you give it a go."}
{"text":"Yasu was my first omakase experience and I am absolutely obsessed! We got the 16 course omakase and the sashimi plate starter. The quality is amazing and you can tell that the chefs pay a lot of attention to details. Every little bite was an explosion of flavours, but my favourite probably has to be the snow crab and the monkfish liver. 

The sushi chefs seem very friendly and cracked jokes with the guests. Unfortunately I made the mistake of reserving a table so I have to try really hard to hear the chef's jokes from 3 meters away... Please don't make the same mistake as me and make sure to grab a reservation at the bar instead!"}
{"text":"Small sushi place on Harbord with only 12 seats so reservations are necessary. Menu is set so you enjoy whatever they're serving. Food is good but not outstanding. Nicely prepared, and plenty of pieces of sushi, but some of the fish choices were very similar to each other (ie. several different mackerels). I expected more variety. Good service and a nice choice of sake and wines. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Yasu is definitely one of the top sushi experiences in Toronto, without being too harsh on the wallet

Bite after bite of heavenly pieces of sushi is delivered to your plate one by one. The anticipation is half the fun when you sit at the chefs counter and watch the magic happens. Fish is carefully sliced with precision, and with the utmost respect. The freshness and taste is unparalleled.

I find the price paid to be quite reasonable for the amount of food and quality. I do recommend the sake pairings, which I did - but it will certainly double the dining price."}
{"text":"Great dining experience at Yasu! 

The hubby and I came here to celebrate our anniversary and we couldn't be happier with the whole experience.  We sat at the bar (must do) so we got to watch how the sushi chefs fillet and prepared each piece of fish with great details and precision.  Seeing and then tasting it made it a great experience so make sure you don't get stuck sitting at the tables behind the bar. 

As for the food, it was heavenly delicious. Each piece of sushi has an unique taste with the various garnish like sheiso leaf, daikon, spicy roe, crab liver mousse, Yuzu zest and don't even get me started on the variety of sauces.  We had so many different types of fish that I can't even keep track but what I know is all my previous bad experiences with certain type of fish for example mackerel doesn't apply here. Every thing was uber fresh and didn't have any fishy taste to it.  I would recommend getting the premium Omasake, for $25 more, you will get sea urchin, blue fin tuna, scallop and 2 more premium fish. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was perfection. We went in with high expectations and did not leave disappointed. The taste and presentation of food was impeccable. Everything was so fresh and came from different parts of the world. The service was also highly attentive, friendly and not pretentious at all. It was such a wonderful experience to be seated at the bar and watch the artists at work. It's hard to pinpoint what our favourite piece was, but if I had to choose, I'd say uni (sea urchin). Fresh, buttery and a hint of sweetness. The bill was hefty, but we came to celebrate my husband's birthday. Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Delicious going in but a disaster coming out.  Be warned, anyone with immune compromised health can become hospitalized from this type of illness. They need to look at the sourcing of their shellfish because multiple people in our party got violently ill 48 hrs after eating there. Vomiting and profuse watery diarrhea. This was likely NOT from improper food handling but from poor food sourcing. Very sad we cannot go back as it was delicious."}
{"text":"Yasu is a great spot for birthday, anniversary, or any special occasion celebrations.

Reservations: 

- Reservations open up 1 month in advance, and always always ALWAYS reserve the bar instead of the odd table in the back behind the bar seating.

Price: 

- It's not ridiculously pricy at $105 per person for some really good quality sashimi.
- I also recommend getting the sashimi platter at an extra $25. You're already there so might as well!

Menu:

The menu varies depending on the fish in season but you'll probably always get some of the classics (3 tuna belly slides at various fat levels, sea urchin etc)

Staff:

There are 3 chefs covering 2 or 3 pairs at the bar. They explain to you where the fish is from and tell you how to eat it. Watching them prepare and cut the slices of fish was really neat. 

There's free street parking nearby if anyone is looking to drive."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Took my wife here for her birthday.

Premium sushi with Saki pairing came to approx $200/pp, it's not a place I could afford to eat at everyday,  but definitely a great place to take a loved one for a special occasion.

They take their time to explain each piece of art they create and where the fish came from.

Would be nice if they had valet parking for the price, but the food and service alone was spectacular"}
{"text":"Great service and the fish is super fresh.   Only ten seats per seating service so book ahead.  Get seats close to the owner/chef to see how it's done!"}
{"text":"Went to Yasu with my girlfriend and it was hands down the best sushi I have ever had in Toronto. The price was a little steep and came out to about $300 after getting some wine. would definitely recommend this place and have recommended this to everyone I know, but its definitely an occasion spot as not everyone has $300 to blow on a single date night."}
{"text":"I'm really torn between a 4 star and 5 star rating for this place but decided to round up.  Coming from New York, I definitely have my share of top notch sushi establishments in the city to choose from, but $80 CAD (~$60 USD with the current FX rate) for 18 pieces of fish plus dessert in an intimate 12 seat omakase restaurant is something that does not exist in the city.

The fish was very fresh, and you get some really high quality cuts as well (ie. uni, otoro).  Otoro and scallops were probably the highlights for me, and I also quite liked the monk fish liver which you don't normally find in a lot of omakases.  The fish was brought out at a measured pace (everyone is served at once) and the portion was just right although you can get additional pieces for a surcharge as well.  I loved the sesame ice cream at the end too since I normally like to finish with something sweet and not all Japanese restaurants will indulge me there.

DO make a reservation since it is a very intimate setting, and request bar seats closer to the entrance since then you'll be served directly by Chef Yasu."}
{"text":"To begin with let's be clear.  This is THE BEST SUSHI IN TORONTO.  This means a lot to me to say this because I have spent quite a bit of time in Asia and there are a lot of sushi restaurants in Toronto and we have eaten in most of them and there are a few that I like a lot but none of them come close to Yasu.  Okay.  I got that out of the way.  Now for the rest.  First of all you need a reservation and it will take a few weeks to get one at least--there are no walk-ins.  They have a two hour sitting at 6p and another at 830p.  Dinner is $80 prix fixe for 17 pieces of sushi.  That would seem a lot except this is THE BEST SUSHI IN TORONTO.  We arrived a little early and they were not ready so I would arrive a little after your reservation.  The sake and dessert were also excellent.  The service was a little stiff and I think perhaps two hours is a bit much for me--I would prefer an hour and a half.  Also you really don't get the vibe of a place that you could come to regularly or have a lot of drinks.  But we will be back and again...this is THE BEST SUSHI IN TORONTO."}
{"text":"The thing is, you cannot compare this $80 omakase with $180 1 Michelin star or $400 3 Michelin star sushi. 

For the price, it is excellent and wonderful. The restaurant is beautiful, the sushi is excellent. It is extremely enjoyable and for most people it will probably be the best sushi you have eaten in your life. 

I will definitely be back. I only have good things to say, given the price. Had the pleasure to try Shirako sushi for the first time... Seasonal... you can Google that."}
{"text":"Don't think you can go wrong with Yasu for $80 per person. 

The fish is super fresh. The unni and monk fish foie gras tasted amazing. I won't spoil the rest but they definitely use premium ingredients. My date said it reminded her of omakaze in japan. 

Asked for a split sake pairing but they just give one shot glass and you share, which is fine if you're out with the gf/bf. But doesn't seem like they're willing to split it with two separate glasses.

Got seats by Yasu and he's really friendly, down to earth kind of guy but has a heavy accent.

Overall really enjoyed the dinner and the intimate setting."}
{"text":"Finally tried Yasu in August 2015 and it did not disappoint! My favorites were the sea eel (not the eel served at typical sushi places) and sweet tomago. Comes to over $100/person, but worth the splurge if you're looking for a unique dining experience."}
{"text":"Out of the many omakase restaurants I've tried in Toronto, Yasu has got to be one of my favourites. Decent pricing for a great selection of sushi ($80 for 18 pieces of excellent and fresh quality sushi). 
What I find most appealing to other omakase restaurants is that they offer only sushi in their meal courses, which is a plus for me!
I've been to yasu two times and I will come back again. The two times I've been there, there is a slight difference to the sushi that were made. Both times I've sat at the bar where I'm able to communicate with the chefs and watch them work their magic. Chefs are extremely friendly and definitely loves what they do!"}
{"text":"I've been to Yasu twice, and both times were just incredible experiences. I really like the interior set-up so that all patrons', service staff's, and sushi chefs' focus are all on the sushi. You get high quality seasonal products that are mind-blowing and not an experience easily replicated elsewhere. I was thoroughly impressed by the care that goes into each piece of sushi from slicing the fish, to adding the lemon zest, to even accommodating requests (like less rice, or working around allergies). If you are going to splurge on sushi done right, it's here. I do wish the dessert was a bit more varied like other places. The single scoop of black sesame ice cream ends is more of an abrupt dénouement than ending on a sweet note. However, for the sushi itself it is still worth a 5-star rating in my opinion.

Maybe it's the nostalgia bias but Yasu was my first Omakase experience a couple years ago and after trying Sushi Kaji and Zen, it is still my favourite."}
{"text":"Exquisite, every course was a hit. Best sushi in Toronto as far as I'm concerned!  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"You want to make a reservation early for Yasu, so you will be seated along the sushi bar. My girlfriend and I sat at the table, and our food came to us a little later then everyone else with every course. This reservation only restaurant serves omakase style, with no a la carte. Perfect for date night! Decor is modern, but I could've wished for a little less lighting as I felt it was a little too bright. The sushi was very fresh and in season. We definitely had a great time. Only complaint was they didn't have a corkage fee so we couldn't bring our own favorite bottle of sake."}
{"text":"That's it.... I don't think I can go to another sushi place. I thought it was just hype but you can really taste and experience the difference when eating sushi at Yasu.

18 pieces of sushi chosen by the chef with each piece created in front of you and served artfully and delisiouciously. The flavors got more interesting and diverse as the meal continued. The rice was the best sushi rice I've ever had and every piece of sushi was incredibly tasty and so fresh. Each piece was just as good, if not better than the last piece that was served.

Not only was the food perfect, but so was the presentation. Each time the chef finished creating your sushi, he would place it on your plate and explain to you what you are going to eat and where it came from. He doesnt ask, but he even takes notice of if you are left or right handed and places the sushi on your plate angled according to your dominant hand to make it easier for you to pick up. I've never seen little details like that done anywhere else and I thought that was such a small but incredible gesture.

To keep it simple, the food is amazing, the staff is friendly and watching the chefs work is a show in itself. Definately worth the price tag. You have to check this place out if you are in Toronto."}
{"text":"I love that Yasu is paying homage to a more traditional take on omakase meals. I love that their repertoire of fish selection includes new and different types of fish. 

However, as a self-described purist, I'd love it if the chefs did not use the same sauce on every, literally, every piece throughout the meal. The sauce, while great on one or two stronger fish such as the mackerel, drowns out the flavour of milder and sweeter pieces, like scallop, uni and amaebi. 

Also would have loved to have seen maybe a bit more in terms of a starter or some cooked appetizers."}
{"text":"My bf loved the experience since he's from Japan! I loved every single item, perfect balance of flavour. Would come back again"}
{"text":"This place really deserves 4.5 stars, but they're still new and not quite deserving of the full 5.  However, this is as close to a true-omakase style sushi meal that you will find in Toronto, and at $80 per person for this quality of fish, it's actually good value.  

I have been fortunate to eat at many amazing sushi restaurants in the US and gotten their omakase (Urasawa in LA, Masa / Nakazawa / 15 East / Ushiwakamaru / Ichimura / Yasuda / Azabu in NY) and while this isn't quite to that level, at this price point, it is close, and certainly the best I've had in Toronto.  

Sushi Kaji for many years was the king of Toronto sushi, but having gone there many years ago and then again a few months ago, I feel they've \"sold out\".  The fish quality has deteriorated significantly, and the sushi-making is much less personal now given they expanded the bar (Kaji-san makes every one's pieces at once now, and then servers come and bring you the pieces on a plate)... Kaji's tasting menu also provides more cooked dishes (which are good, but nothing spectacular) and is more expensive.  I'd much rather go to Yasu now over Kaji... 

Anyways, back to Yasu.  This is traditional sushi omakase (nigiri-only, no sashimi).  The fish quality is excellent, and you get ~17 pieces in total + dessert.  Many pieces are flown in from Japan and Europe.  The fish has that \"high-quality taste\", with the soft \"melt-in-your-mouth\" texture.  The preparation is a bit below what I've experienced at the top-end sushi restaurants, though still with good attention to detail.  For example: for each fish, the chef at Yasu made 6 pieces at once, rolling the rice nuggets all first, placing the fish on and making the sushi, and then adding the garnishes / sauce if necessary).  True sushi chefs at the highest level will make their pieces one (or two) at a time, and then place the sushi immediately on the customer's plate.  The temperature of the sushi after leaving the sushi chef's hands is important for sushi at this level (and why you're supposed to eat it in less than 5 seconds after the sushi is placed on your plate).  Can most people (including myself) taste the difference?  Probably not.  But they say it makes a difference, so just thought I'd point it out.  In fairness though, as another reviewer has said, Yasu-san makes sushi for the 4 people at the end of the sushi bar closer to the kitchen.  I was at the other end, and so our sushi was made by the other chef.  Did not know who was Yasu-san until the very end of the meal, so didn't notice whether it was any different at the other end of the sushi bar.  Conversation with the sushi chef was fairly minimal but for him mentioning what the fish was and where it was from.  

Service was also a tad on the overly casual side, for a restaurant of this calibre.  I enjoy banter and friendliness from servers, but at times this swayed to the unprofessional side of the spectrum.  

Overall, a fantastic meal, incredible sushi and at a reasonable price for this quality of fish.  Toronto needs more restaurants like this!  I will definitely be back!

{"text":"If you looking for a real sushi experience, go to Yasu. 

If you just want to eat salmon sashimi till you full, there are tons of ayce places you can go to on Bloor St.

I am just happy that Ouchi San decided to open Yasu. I have been to his previous restaurant Nigiri-Ya at Leaside it was good but not as good as what he is doing at Yasu now. $80 seems to be steep for \"sushi\" but trust me the experience more than worth it! 

Fresh fish and seafood from all over the world including Japan, Europe, North America. Each fish is featured as a piece of art in nigiri sushi with just the perfect preparation method and condiments (fresh wasabi, soya sauce, yuzu salt, shiso, ginger....) 

Procedure: 
- watch the preparation
- listen to the explanation
- admire my food
- smell my food which will further enhance my experience
- use my hand and put it my mouth and eat slowly and just let my taste buds dance
- making happy noises and smile
- Repeat

I was sad that I miss the fresh  Hokkaido Uni but seriously Aburi O-toro, Ankimo, Hokkaido Scallop even Mackerel tasted so good...

I will be back.. I want to be back... 

When am I coming back? (let me go check their availability on Yelp reservation!)"}
{"text":"A good friend had mentioned Yasu numerous times, but having lived in Japan I typically find most of the restaurants to be good by \"Canadian Standards\", not necessarily by Japanese standards. I can't express how amazing the entire service was, from food quality to server attitude. 

The omakase (Chef's choice) comes with 18 pieces of sushi - lots of great pieces like blue fin tun, bonita, mackeral, red snapper, scallop, salmon roe and so forth - every piece was handcrafted, extremely fresh and made with perfection - had such an amazing experience. Even the things I normally wouldn't be a fan of like liver, eel and salmon roe were so tasty. Another poster mentioned the high quality of the salmon roe and I would completely agree. 

Overall the price is on the high-end ($80 per person) especially if you have a few drinks, but if you are a sushi lover, this is extremely reasonable. In Tokyo you would potentially pay double or more. While I won't be a weekly regular at Yasu, I will definitely be coming here once every few months. Such an amazing place, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Best sushi experience in Toronto. If you love sushi you must try it out ! Everything is so fresh and tasty. I suggest pairing it with sake"}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite place for sushi hands down.
If you have seen the documentary, Jiro Dreams of Sushi, you will definitely appreciate this restaurant.

I went last summer just before word got out about their sublime sushi, back then you could get a reservation for 4 just two weeks ahead, but I'm sure the wait is much longer now.
As probably have read there are only 10 seats in the restaurant with only two seatings per night, so the sushi chefs could really hone in on their attention to detail and craft some of the freshest and most delicious sushi I have tried in a long, long time.
The place is sleek, modern and minimal, a casual and very comfortable place that doesn't distract from the food and service. I really like the cut crystal-like glass serving trays which really elevates and make the sushi morsels stand out.

$80 for 18 pieces of sushi is reasonable in my opinion considering the quality and preparation -- there are no trendy gimmicks here which is great if you are a sushi purist. I also consider watching the three sushi chefs preparing the sushi a performance that's part of the great dining experience. They know how to highlight the taste of the fish and each piece had its own characteristic.
The service was great even though their English is not very good. The three sushi chefs work in almost zen-like quietness crafting each piece of sushi with grace and attention, they will often try to engage in conversation with the diners even though they may not fully understand the English. My water glass was always filled right away and I fell in love with a rare sake that was recommended to me -- the waitress managed to pick the perfect sake for me based on the flavor profiles I was looking for which took some time to explain what I wanted.
The amount of food for this omakase meal was just perfect for me, if you are still hungry for more they will make more pieces for you with the limited amount of fish they have on hand for a little extra, though they shop many times a week specifically for each dinner seating.

The black sesame ice cream to end the meal was very good and I like the creamy rich sesame flavours which pleasantly nutty and toasty. The grey colour of the ice cream was both unusual and really stunning to look at -- I want to paint a room that colour!"}
{"text":"If you are ever splurging on sushi and spending you life savings on a meal, Yasu would be the place to go. Yes, it is \"your last supper\" quality type of food.

The cost of the meal is $110 per person. Yes, you will notice the prices of it has been steadily increasing as you scroll through reviews. YOLO! Each piece of sushi is made to perfection. Lobster, grouper, jack fish, toro, sweet shrimp, mackerel, eel, tamago, uni, to name a few are all part of the Omasake courses. Interestingly enough, my favourite part before I mistakenly Google what it is, was a part of the cod, as described by our server. It was soft with a hint of sweetness and had a creamy ocean finish. The cod organ is dressed with yuzu soy sauce. I was determined to find out what the part was (I will reveal which organ was served at the end of this review. Feel free to skip it if you feel ignorance is bliss). 

Seafood from Yasu  are sourced from around the globe. Rice is well seasoned. Temperature of the fish or crustacean is well controlled. Even the spoon provided for the sesame ice cream dessert was cold. 

I cannot rave enough about Yasu! Highly recommend it if you have to choose a last meal on earth in Toronto. 

The Big Reveal: the cod part is called Shirako. It is the cod's sperm sack."}
{"text":"The first omakase I had in Toronto. Not sure the quality about others. So I compare it with some of the good ones I had in NYC. 
Price is good, lower than NYC
Service people are very friendly and introduce the fish on each sushi you have.
The place is hard to get a parking though... I ended up parking somewhere 15mins walk to there. They only have two small tables and 12 sushi counter seats. Chairs are very cozy and soft.
In terms of fish quality, they were fresh enough for me:) but the types of fish were limited- most of sushi were tuna (lean, medium and fatty). I didn't get one with uni.. probably not their favorite things to serve. 
The size and number of sushi were good enough that I felt very full after eating all of them.
I gave it 4 star.. nothing wrong but nothing amazing."}
{"text":"This place is pricey but it's certainly an experience, which explains why this place requires reservations months in advance. Make sure to book the bar seats because getting to watch their skilled chefs is what makes this place worth it. You get a large number of unique kinds of sushi during the omakase that most other sushi spots won't serve, such as bonito. Also, you get ootoro which is amazingly buttery tuna. Also take note that the entire dinner can last around 2 hours since the chefs are painstakingly crafting your sushi slowly and carefully.

Oh and they do use a lot of wasabi, but they do let you know at the beginning of the dinner to let the chef know if you don't want as much wasabi or more soy sauce, etc. Each chef only takes care of a couple of patrons, so this is quite doable for them."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!

Omakase!! Whether it be the regular omakase or the premium upgrade of the omakase, they are both delicious!

Regular omakase costs $105 pp and the upgrade is an additional $25 pp. The only difference between the regular and the upgrade is the amount of sashimi you get with the upgrade as the first course. Regular would only get you an oyster and scallops whereas a premium omakase will get you an additional sashimi pieces. You get uni from Japan, blue fin tuna slices, lobster sashimi, and stripe jack fish slice. 

You have to really love fish because the whole omakase is fish from different areas of the world! The experience really takes you around the world with the fish they source from and present before you. Their kitchen is basically what you see when you enter the restaurant! They make everything at the bar. It's really cool to see them make your sushi right before your eyes. 

Unlike other omakase, it's not about the presentation here. Nothing fancy accompanies the sushi or sashimi slices and you won't see any flowers or fog or great presentation. It's just the freshness of the fish and where they source their fish that makes up the price that you pay. 

My favorite dish is of course the blue fin tuna. There were three pieces of different sections of the blue fin tuna that was served as three pieces of sushi as one course. I loved every piece of it that I ordered more of it! If you want more sushi, you can order at the end of the meal too. Just to let you know the benchmark you're looking at is $7-9 per sushi if you want more sushi and depending on what sushi you order more of! 

There is also a wine menu that you can order alcohol to accompany your omakase experience. Ranges from 4 oz of sake to 9 oz of Japanese wine to a full bottle of 300-700 ml. There was one bottle of Japanese wine that was about $1000! You can also do sake pairing ($65) with the set course which is nice! 

Overall, I thought the chefs were nice to show their knife craftsmanship before our eyes and our particular chef greeted us with a smile. I liked how they kept asking us how our experience was and made us feel very welcomed. And most of all, the dishes came from all over the world. From Boston to Vancouver to Mexico to Iceland to Alaska to New Zealand, I felt like I went fishing around the world and got to taste of the world! 

LAST TIP?!

The restaurant is REALLY small. I really recommend you to make a reservation to sit at the bar because you get to see the knife action before your eyes. Like I said, the kitchen is basically where the three chefs stand at the bar. There are only two tables that surround the outer area of the bar that people can sit at. Either two or four people. You can somewhat see the chef but you won't have a good view of the fish they are slicing or what they are doing behind the bar! So yes, worth the wait to find a spot at the bar!! Premium upgrade is worth it if you love sashimi and want to try out more sashimi from various parts of the world. It is also additional food so if you're up for more, premium is a good option to go. I think I would still order premium set next time I go! Mind you, some of the sushi you order may appear throughout the courses you see with the regular omakase too (except for the lobster sashimi, and the uni sashimi that is from Hokkaido). There's no particular spot where I would sit at the bar that would be better. I guess it depends on which chef you like best if you go here often but it's usually preassigned because there's only 12 seats around the bar for each sitting!!"}
{"text":"YASU is well worth the money. Absolutely fresh fish from around the world.  Atmosphere is perfect. Highly recommended & will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation a few weeks ahead of time.Definitely go for the bar and not the table if it's still available. I think they only seat 2-3 dinners a night and the restaurant fits around 18 people. We ended up getting a table and wish we got a seat at the bar. The bar gives you a great view of the chefs and they explain the fish and food to you. The dinner lasts about 2.5 hours and has 16 pieces of sushi. At the end they'll ask you if you want extras for an additional price. 

Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"Food was very good but not great... the sushi chef butchered a few of the pieces and overall thought the fish pieces were sliced too thin for my liking.  If Tsujiki Market is a 10, I'd give Yasu a generous 7."}
{"text":"I picked Yasu for my birthday dinner this year because I heard so many glowing reviews about this place. First things first, the restaurant is small, so be sure to book early (resos open 30 days in advance). I booked maybe 20 days before my birthday and couldn't get a seat at he bar, which is highly recommended. We were seated at a small table by the window, which was nice, but the whole time I was throwing envious glances at the diners at the sushi bar. I feel that sitting at the sushi bar really elevates the whole omakase experience. 
As for the food, it did not disappoint. I thought the sushi overall was exquisite, and I also appreciated the education throughout dinner (the chef or a server will come explain to you where each fish is from). I paid an extra $25 for the deluxe sashimi plate, which included oyster, sea urchin, and fatty tuna on top of what was offered in the standard set. That's basically everything I love, so I thought it was well worth the extra charge. One area that left me desiring more was the dessert- it was simply black sesame ice cream. For the price paid, I'd like to have seen something a little more creative.
But all in all, I had a fantastic experience at Yasu. It's definitely not cheap (but apparently it's pretty well priced for omakase), but the sushi is truly delicious. I would highly recommend for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Where oh where do I begin here?! Get ready folks, this is going to be a long review.

Made a reservation ~2 weeks in advance for a weekday dinner reso. Questions you must ask yourself: do you want to reserve a bar seat (highly recommended) or a table seat? do you want to dine at 6 or 8:15pm? I took the 6pm time at the bar seats and it was probably the best choice you can make.

Did my research and they said they start promptly at 6 and wouldn't encourage anyone to be late. So being as eager as I was for my first omakase experience, showed up 15 mins early and actually had to wait outside for a bit as they weren't even opened yet. We actually didn't start eating till roughly 6:20pm. PS - found free street parking nearby, there's tons of residential streets around, or Green P parking right on Harbord.

A grand total of 12 bar seats to watch the chefs work their magic, plus a 2 person table near the window, and a ~4 person booth-like table. Yes, that's all the people they can fit at once so don't even think about walking in to this place without a reso. 

We were served 18 pieces of sushi of varying fresh seafood from all over the globe and BOY was it super fresh! It's as if I had physically just caught a fish and just bit into it's smooth body (ok maybe not that graphic). The precision and care put into each piece by the chef was such a work of art to witness, I don't understand why you would come here to not sit at the bar and watch them. The chefs were very friendly as well and cracked a few jokes here and there. My top 3 pieces of the night have got to be the scallop, uni, and smoked bonito. Honestly, I don't think I've ever had such amazing uni in my life. Oddest thing I ate (and probably on my list of all the weird things I've ate in my life) was the shirako (aka milt aka fish semen). It not only looks like brains but it also tasted a bit odd, it's hard to describe... All in all, every single piece we ate was made with so much care and the texture was just so amazing. Even the tamago (a piece of egg that was so spongy and soft, it tasted like cake) and the black sesame ice cream were incredible. Just writing this is making my mouth water again. 

However, why is this place not a 5 star for me? There's quite a few areas of improvement. Firstly, an indoor waiting area would be nice (def not necessary in the summer), secondly, as authentic as the chefs were, it was sometimes hard to understand the sushi they were describing. Would've loved either a printed menu to refer to and understand or perhaps one of the waiters could reiterate to us as many customers had to repeatedly ask. Lastly, and my biggest reason for deducting a star, was that the same soy sauce was used on every single piece. Though it can enhance the flavour of some sushi pieces, it can also overpower others. There were a few pieces I would've preferred a lighter soy sauce (or no soy sauce) to truly take in the taste. It was quite salty at times and other patrons agreed. 

Overall, yas u should check out Yasu (get it?? am I lame at puns??). It has definitely set the bar for quality sushi and my first omakase experience."}
{"text":"WOW. $105/person (+$25 for the premium sashimi plate) seems to be very excessive for sushi but this is MORE than just food...it truly is an experience that comes with it!

What is OMAKASE?
It's basically a tasting menu of seasonal fish of the sushi chef's choosing that differs every time (which is why they don't have a specific menu). The sushi chef makes the dishes right in front of you and explains the ingredient while serving it.

//THE FOOD//
~20 sushi pieces/dishes were served, with a small scoop of black sesame ice cream at the very end of the meal. 
My personal favourite dishes were the monk fish liver, salmon roe with sashimi on seasoned rice, uni sashimi, and the medium fatty salmon sashimi.

//THE EXPERIENCE//
They only take reservations and make sure you request for the bar seat so you can witness all the sushi making magic! Once you walk in, only 2 servers are present, come early so you get to choose where you sit. There's a sushi master and 2 other sushi chefs that are in charge of making all the food. The meal starts off with the sashimi plate and it's about a 5-10 minute wait for the making of each of the subsequent sushi/dish. Throughout the entire night, I interacted with the sushi master who was serving our corner of the bar seating area. He's very polite and answered all my questions about the fishes he used/inspiration behind some of the dishes! 

//OVERALL//
This place definitely gave me an unforgettable dining experience. I would highly recommend this for a special occasion outing for individuals who really appreciate sushi."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that this place is AMAZING! Brought my boyfriend here on his birthday and we both were completely in awe with their food. The chefs make the sushi right in front of you, so like others have already reviewed, it's definitely best to get a seat at the sushi bar where you can see all the live action. They serve you loads of sushi so you don't still feel hungry at the end of your meal, and they also ask you if you want extra if you can still fit in more in your stomach!

I didn't find it hard to get a seat at the sushi bar, and only made a reservation a few days in advance, but I would recommend making a reservations at least a week in advance.

It's a bit pricey, but worth every dollar - we also tried the plum sake which was a miss for my boyfriend, but I thought it was good! Not sure if I would get it again, as it tasted extremely watered down, but it was still nice to try. 

Definitely give this place a try if you're in for the splurge! (Also, this place is very casual - no need to dress up)"}
{"text":"Had the omakase and sake pairing last night and it was perfection. Intimate restaurant made it feel like you had a one on one experience with the chef. Highly recommended and unique sushi experience in Toronto."}
{"text":"Life changing sushi experience for me. How can something so simple taste so good? Simply put, just quality ingredients and devotion from the chefs"}
{"text":"The sushi here was amazing. Ambiance was alright, but would definitely return for the food."}
{"text":"Its absolutely overhyped. The food is just ok. Not high end sushi for sure but better than average. The chef in the middle position offer different services standard for different customers. I don't want to say its racism but its not professional for sure. Disappointed in general."}
{"text":"What happens when you put quality sushi, and an amazing experience together? You get YASU. A truly unforgettable experience as we were served this Fatty Tuna O-Toro, one of the 18-pieces from their omakase sushi dinner menu.

Their interior decor is quite simple, with much of the focus on the sushi bar, creating a very intimate setting between the chef and the guests. Seating at the sushi bar is limited (no more than 12), which gave everyone a front row experience to watch the chefs technically demonstrate their knife craftsmanship, using only fresh ingredients from Japan, and carefully handcrafting each piece to perfection. 

Service was top-notch, as their staff were attentive, courteous, and made the whole experience much more enjoyable. Overall, @yasutoronto exceeded all my expectations. Definitely a bucket list item that must be crossed off, if you're a diehard sushi fan. My biggest fear now is expecting all my sushi experiences to be like this. Sigh, talk about first world problems."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place five stars - I truly did. But while the food was remarkable, a small service flub at the end of the meal kept it just short of flawless, and for about $110 a person, perfection should be the measuring stick.

My party of 3 arrived at about 8:32 for an 8:30 reservation, and we were the last ones there (the restaurant only seats ten at a time). We were welcomed by name, and promptly seated at the far end of the sushi bar. It's worth noting, perhaps, that the three of us were served exclusively by Yasu himself - I don't know whether his placement is consistent, but if it is, it's worth asking to be seated near the kitchen so that he's serving you.

The restaurant is small (in an old converted home), but the décor is modern. The lighting is provided by potlights over every diner's sushi plate, so the fish is beautifully illuminated. A somewhat eclectic, but surprisingly ambient mix of electric music plays softly in the background (it's less weird than I'm making it sound). A sole waitress walked by from time to time to make small talk and refill our water.

Hot towels and a drink menu were promptly sent around. I wanted to preserve my palate for the fish, so we ordered sparkling water, instead of something from their rather extensive sake menu. Expecting a huge markup (the sparkling water wasn't a menu item), we were pleasantly surprised that they only charged us $4.50.

I can't remember each course in detail or in sequence, but suffice to say, everything was uniformly excellent. Particularly standout were the lean Toro, which tasted extraordinarily fresh, the mackerel, whose distinct fishy taste was beautifully complemented by a pickled daikon wrap, and the Ankimo (monkfish liver), whose title as the 'foie gras of the sea' is clearly well deserved. There was no Uni the night we went, which was disappointing - apparently they had some in stock last week, but alas, they've since run out.
The dessert, a green tea panna cotta, was better than I anticipated - the texture and density were wonderfully light, and the matcha flavor was spot-on in its intensity.

The preparation process was delightful to watch - the two chefs are clearly masters of their craft, and their deft knifework and meticulous attention to detail is a sight to behold. If even a small imperfection was found on a slice of fish, a precise set of tweezers (they almost looked like surgical forceps) was brought out, and the errant blemish removed.

The reason I'm deducting a star is because the two chefs seemed to have forgotten a piece of fish; one of the parties was served snow crab, but the others weren't. The chefs seemed to realize this mistake afterwards, as they looked into the fish case, saw the evident excess of crab, and looked sheepishly at one another. The two conferred quietly in Japanese, then offered everyone an extra piece. Obviously, my friends and I jumped at the opportunity, but in an apparent misunderstanding, our plates were ushered away and the dessert presented. A relatively minor fault in the grand scheme of things, but a substantive one.

The chefs speak somewhat spotty English, and it was often difficult to decipher what exactly they were saying. This ordinarily wouldn't warrant mentioning, but part of the experience is knowing the provenance of what you are eating, so it's a relevant factor here. Because of the language gap, engaging Yasu across the counter felt initially rather intimidating, but by the end of the evening, I had asked him about his own culinary history - his experience opening Nobu in Australia (his wife is Australian!), his previous operation of Nigiri-Ya, and the critical acclaim that Yasu has so far garnered.

In all, this place is great for splurge sushi - an end of the month/pay day treat, or an evening out with the significant other. I have no doubt that the small slip last night was not a regular part of business, and I look very much forward to returning a second time to confirm this hypothesis. 

In the name of science, of course."}
{"text":"Omg the food was amazing! I came here for my birthday and we had such an amazing meal. Although I wasn't really that full after ... But still such a great way to try different fishes/seafood."}
{"text":"Came with my husband and our experience was underwhelming. We liked the quality of fish but the menu was not creative. We had miso soup as an appetizer and green tea ice cream for dessert. It was way too generic. Service was adequate but also underwhelming (tea was not refilled frequently enough). Overall, it felt like a westernized omakaze. I would recommend Zen over Yasu."}
{"text":"If you want to experience omakase, this is the place you have to go! 

The restaurant itself is super small and you'll be eating in a very intimate setting (a little less than 20 seats in the restaurant). Seating is either around the bar or on the tables about 2 feet away from the bar. I would definitely go with bar seating for the full experience. 

Right off the bat you'll be treated by the servers and the sushi chefs and they'll give you their full attention throughout the serving. I was given the option of choosing between the regular omakase and and upgrade to premium sashimi for an extra $25. I figured if I'm spending $110 anyways, an extra $25 couldn't hurt. With the premium upgrade, I was served toro sashimi, uni and scallop. The sashimi and all the seafood that followed was extremely fresh and clean (to taste). 

It's impossible to expect what seafood you'll be served that night as omakase plates depend on seasonality. However during my visit I had to opportunity to try such nigiris as monk fish liver, stripejack, mackerel, uni, and red shrimp. With each dish the servers or sushi chef will explain the food being presented in front of you, where it came from and how to eat it. We finished the nigiri selection with beautifully sweet tamago and fragrant black sesame ice cream. 

My favourite for the night was the monkfish liver nigiri, the shiso and ponzu daikon helped cut through the heaviness of the liver. I was also surprised with the shirako as I expected the slimy texture to be off putting but it wasn't and almost dissolved in your mouth. They tell you is \"a part of cod\" without any further description and I wouldn't advise googling which part unless you are truly curious. 

Overall a great experience and I would definitely come back without hesitation if it were a special occasion. One of a must try's for sushi lovers and a \"have to do try it once\" experience for all foodies."}
