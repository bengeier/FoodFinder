{"text":"The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because they people were nice. The food on the other hand, should get 1 star and only because most of it was edible. We ordered the Hawaiian bbq beef plate, large bento, fried noodles and a side of kim cheese along with 2 drinks. Total bill for two people, $30, which is decent, however.. beef was fatty and tasted reheated. Sauce on the spicy chicken in the bento plate was nothing short of sweet and sour sauce from a jar with added siracha- terrible. Kim cheese was NOT made from Napa cabbage, but instead regular green cabbage and pretty much resembled coleslaw with red chili flakes.. It may be a harsh review but honestly, if you're from Hawaii, like I am, especially Kahuku, you would know that the food that comes from that city is second to none. Don't claim to be a \"local\" establishment if you basically serve teriyaki sauce because that doesn't make your food \"local\"... Save your money guys and go to Ross J's."}
{"text":"I went there few days ago and also that was my first time to eat hawaiian food. My firs time to eat kahuku was wonderfull!! I never forget it and i wanna go again.... Fresh fish!! Especially i was so impressed at meat jun and shrimps. I Hope our county has same restaurant like here!"}
{"text":"Thought I would give this place a second chance and it was Disappointing to say the least. I had meat jun and Kalbi. The meat jun was soggy and flavorless like it was yesterday's leftovers and the Kalbi was chewy undercooked and salty. To top it off they give you very small portions for a high price. it was $18! It's not even that expensive at the Ala Moana food court in Honolulu! Do yourself a favor and scratch this place off the list! I won't be going back again."}
{"text":"It was my first time here. The place was really clean and the cashier was really nice. I ordered a BBQ Mix with chicken and Beef. Total was $12.96. The chicken was great, the beef not so much. I will be going back and trying other items in the menu."}
{"text":"It was no terrible but when the food came to the table i found a piece of hair in my poke bowl. When i got another one the fish was very chewy."}
{"text":"The Good:   Pork Katsu plate has HUGE portions Roast Pork is one of the best I have had: fork tender and juicy!  The Bad:  Poke was OK for a place that calls itself \"Kahuku Poke\" Lomi Salmon is OK but needs to be \"lomied\" and aged a day or two Kim Chee needs to be fermented: as it is, it is like eating salted cabbage with some pepper kick.  The Ugly:  Pricing is high  Update 2-19-16  This place still remains a hit or miss proposition since my last review: I have sampled more selections.  Bento: how anyone could screw up a classic is beyond me: in my experience Bentos have always had a portion of beef, pork, chicken and fish on a bead of rice. The rice would be sprinkled with furikaki and a side of tsukimono on top. Sometimes a side of mac salad was offered.  Chicken in the Bento from Kahuku Poke was deep fried battered balls with a heavy garlic and spice flavor: not traditional or my cup of tea. Hot dogs sat in for the traditional Spam for the pork portion: that was OK but a larger portion is required for the price. No furikaki: Now that is blasphemy.  It was nice to see takuan on the side: but again this was \"manini\" sized: too small of a portion for this Hawaiian.  Listen up Kahuku Poke: us Hawaiians don't mind paying a higher price for larger portions but this Bento was too stingy for the price: a resounding fail on this item.  Saimin was added and this was a HUGE hit for me: nothing especially outstanding, just basic goodness served up in a Hawaiian style portion.  Kahuku has seen it fit to add too much pepper in their brown gravy: this takes their EXCELENT Pork Katsu dish down a notch: stop with the spice overload: let me add that if I want to. THANK GOODNESS Kahuku Poke has kept the salt levels low: this is one of the redeeming features of this establishment.  The Hits:  Pork Katsu (BUT WATCH THAT PEPPER, KAHUKU)  Roast Pork  Saimin  The Misses:   Bento Box  Kim Chee (seriously? Store bought would be an improvement)  Lomi  Salmon (I never thought I would say this: but less Salmon and more \"lomi\" get that salmon squished up then let it age overnight to let the flavors meld)  Poke Rice bowl (I don't care WHAT ANYONE SAYS: the poke is OK but not good enough to be sitting on rice)  The misses are getting greater than the hits: Kahuku is risking a star at this point: trying the chicken next.  Up Date 5-10-17  The Barbeque Chicken is good: not great, not bad: just good and good enough to keep them at 4 stars. I also had the combo plate with chicken and pork Katsu and THAT was HUGE! Well worth the price if you are hungry (that alone might have got us to 5 stars but they remain at 4 stars [see below]).  Glad to announce that there is NO pepper in the brown gravy (as it should be)... but, on occasion there DO put some in: I give them a pass because they are new (the kitchen staff is in transition) and might not have the consistency of a more established restaurant.   They have added desserts and I ordered a slice of \"Chantilly\" cake. There are others like guava and they are all pre-sliced and ready to go: the cashier assured me that the Chantilly cake was their best! For me, the cake was dry but the frosting was good: I give it only two stars. The cake might have gotten stale in the refrigerator and when a cake is pre-sliced, it loses moisture: I don't know what the issue was but I probably won't be ordering cake any time soon. They also have cream puffs which I might look at in the future.  I had a craving for some Katsu recently and they were closed: they are now closed on Mondays: bummer.    Kahuku Poke retains their 4 stars."}
{"text":"I ordered 1/2pound of shoyu poke. They have the BEST poke. Made fresh to order.  Melts in your mouth like butter.  The taste was clean and not fishy nor slimy at all.  They add a little chili in there but you cant really taste it unless you eat the chili seed.  Better than any other poke place that I have tasted in town.  Going to try the limu next time.     Ive been here more than once.  Tasted the kalbi/chicken combo.  It was alright.  Im thinking they could marinate it a little longer to really infuse the flavor.  Same with the shoyu chicken which was good but needed a little more ginger to get that real authentic hawaiian flair.  Also ordered spicy bbq chicken which also needed better marinating.   Side dishes are decent. The cabbage kim chee lacks the acidity of real kim chee which was disappointing but still edible.  The mac salad has really improved since the first day they opened.  My bf really likes it and so do I. He compares it to that of Mikis in Hawaii.    Their grand opening is this Saturday 8-8-15 and you get a free shirt with any purchase of $25 or more while supplies last.   Thats easy to do since poke is currently at $18.99/lb."}
{"text":"I love the food just the customer service is terrible.They don't even greet you and when I'm about to order she looks like she hates what she's doing,can't even look at me in the eye."}
{"text":"Went here cause I seen it on facebook. There was three of us. We started started off the spicy poke bowl, the fish was not sashimi grade. It was the darker bloodier part of the fish. Or maybe we got the bottom of the bowl. I wasn't  impress. Then we ordered two dishes. I had the fried noodles looked ono but most noodles was burnt and no flavor. My husband ordered the fish Jun, he said it was just ok. The service was great though and the order was served expeditiously."}
{"text":"I really want to like this establishment so I came in to give it another try. Unfortunately I will not be coming back here....ever! Attached is a photo of spicy ahi mayo poke I ordered. The fish had no quality and was very chewy. I might as well have eaten a tub of mayo since it was all I can taste. And it came with macaroni salad...more mayo!! Food was tasteless and did not finish my plate. Didn't come with the sides that was on the photo in the menu. I'm not a disgruntled irrational customer, just very disappointed."}
{"text":"I would never come back here again!  Very pricey for their food!  Poke was not fresh I wasted the 1lbs poke I bought and threw it away.  The musubi had more rice then spam like really!  The wait was long and my food I ordered wasn't worth waiting for thanks but no thank you!"}
{"text":"Drove by and came in for lunch for some poke. Was told that they are out of poke. Seems to be a regular occurrence. Prices on higher side compared to competition."}
{"text":"I actually really like this place. I wasn't expecting much but I was happy I went. A lil pricey but food is great."}
{"text":"I visited the soft opening of Kahuku Poke and its is delicious. My family and I enjoyed their BBQ chicken, chicken katsu,  BBQ beef short ribs. Definitely looking forward to visit and highly recommend this Hawaiian bbq to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"Great \"home away from home\" food alternative! Being from Hawaii, and now living in the OC, I had to be sure I got my Hawaiian food fix when visiting Vegas. And this came pretty close!  The Customer Service: 5/5 The lady behind the counter was very polite and friendly. She took my order, addressed me by my name each time. She made sure I was taken care of through my time and wait there. She offered various sauces to try with my meal. That's going above and beyond!  The Food: 4/5 Here's what we ordered... Meat Jun- was a little bland to my liking. The meat was lightly seasoned and the egg tasted like, well, egg (unseasoned, perhaps?). Unlike most places in Hawaii where the taste of meat jun is a little on the sweeter side, this one fell short. However, I did pour extra meat jun sauce all over it to get it to my liking. They offer two types of meat jun sauces, original and spicy. I liked both. Mochiko Chicken- just like home! Had no complaints on this one. Highly recommend! Shoyu Poke- melt in your mouth goodness! Pretty close to home, but there was something lacking. Maybe it was the shoyu used, as someone previously mentioned. Also, the price.. $18.99/lb. It's a little on the high side. But hey, can't get as good as this in the OC! Chantilly Cake- don't forget about dessert! Can't seem to find Hawaiian chantilly anywhere in the mainland. Kinda wish it had more chantilly frosting, but that probably jus the fat kid in me talking..  The Restaurant: 4/5 Clean! You don't walk away smelling like the restaurant unlike most Hawaiian/Chinese restaurants. A lot of seating also. Kinda wish they had outdoor seating for those who like sitting outside. Also, ample parking! However, There is one parking stall right in the front of the store reserved for the manager only. Almost parked in his/her stall until I noticed the sign. I would recommend reserving ALL stalls fronting the store for your customers.  See you next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Love the Shoyu Poke, fish is so fresh. Love the BBQ Chicken too, chicken is very tender."}
{"text":"My sister recommended this spot because she knows how much I love and miss Hawaiian food. First off this place is clean, new or not I like places that are clean! Lol. I ordered the garlic shrimp because my sis says it is bomb and I have to admit it was bomb lol. Definitely going to have to take my husband here to try it too! We also had the roast pork and mochiko chicken. Bomb and bomb. Oh yea the poke was good too. I just can't believe that this was the first time I've been here and its the closest to where I stay when Im in town :/  the customer service is good too. Girl up front was super sweet and polite. Good place to come to for sure!"}
{"text":"Soft opening so I will try them again later. As for my visit, I tried their chicken katsu, it seemed like they either didn't want to prep, don't know how or this is actually how they make it. It wasn't pounded out thin, the fat and skin was also left on and the breading was close to uncooked, it was barely browned. Also very expensive. Needless to say I can do better at home. They need to step up their game because right around the corner there is 2 other Hawaiian joints that  I know are good and won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I decided to stop into this new Hawaiian barbecue place that just opened up, I saw it said it was a soft opening and they have a limited menu. I went in anyway. I went to the counter and asked what they were limited too. The cashier was very helpful and let me know everything.  So I started with the SHRIMP TEMPURA and the dipping sauce WOW Then I had the AHI LIMU - WOW do I need to say anymore the best I ever had So then I ordered the LOCO MOCO lol lol lol loved it Yes I took a order of JAP-CHAE home for later and it was great Can not wait till they have a grand opening with the full menu I will be there  Keep up the great food and service AWSOME"}
{"text":"The workers are really nice and the food is really good. It is nice to have options other than L & L for Hawaiian BBQ. Great post work out restaurant because you will get a generous portion of protein and carbs. I highly recommend trying this Hawaiian BBQ restaurant. (:"}
{"text":"Bad customer service. I ordered a garlic shrimp plate and got more of an over cooked lemon peppered shrimp. Being from Hawai'i and growing up eating Kahuku garlic shrimp I expected it to have been almost as good, I mean this is Kahuku Poke and it says \"Worlds Famous\". This is far from it. I went up to the cashier and told her my shrimp was over cooked (the shrimp was half white) and hard so I asked if the cook could make me a new batch and they said she could try cook it medium but it would be a bit raw. At this point I was over it and ordered a fried noodle plate paying for another meal because I was not satisfied. They didn't even offer me a discounted meal or further help so this was such a bad experience. Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"I tried their \"poke\" and it tasted like a salt lick. I could literally feel the salt grains in my teeth! I hate wasting food, so I'm usually good about finishing even bad meals, but I could only get through one-third of the container until it became inedible. $15 down the drain."}
{"text":"My dad has been raving about this place nonstop since the beginning of the year, it is now the end of August.  The parking is a bit awkward, and I think the format of the seating could use work, but the lighting is great. The staff is friendly, but most importantly their poke straight broke da mout! I asked for spicy though, and that could use some work. Otherwise, so happy to find another fantastic Hawaiian place in the valley."}
{"text":"Honestly it's like L&L but way over priced. The only thing they have that L&L doesn't is the poke. Restaurant is very awkward, maybe they should play some music? Other wise everything was alright."}
{"text":"I agree with previous comments... The Shoyu sauce is not very good. It's as if they covered it in soy sauce AND then added more salt. All you can taste is sodium. My first experience with poke was in Oahu and this doesn't taste like that. If you want some authentic poke, go to Island Sushi. It's amazing there.   I will say the garlic shrimp was fairly good. But not amazing.   Overall, we paid over $30 for two mediocre meals. I didn't even finish the poke plate it was so bad! That's a first for me! :("}
{"text":"This was the 2nd time I've tried the location, the first time was a better experience.  I order some poke, and being in Vegas I know the price is going to be higher, so I wasn't shocked.  The thing that took me by surprise was the mini bbq chicken plate...it was super mini, they tried to fill in some space with a bed of shredded cabbage, but even still, it looked like it was for a a child.  The scoop rice was like half an actual scoop, and the Mac salad was like half an actual scoop, and the chicken I got must've been the runt of the litter.  I think I was done in 3 bites.  The thing that bothered me the most was the spam musubi, I'm still questioning if that was truly spam, or luncheon meat, because yes, there is a difference, but the worse part was the plastic wrap...idk what kind they are using, but it smells down right toxic, and the smell even carries over into the flavor of the luncheon meat musubi.  I try to support business that tout the 808 state, but after this, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Just had lunch with my daughter @ Kahuku Poke & BBQ. What can I say, awesome! I had the #19 Loco Moco and she had the #40 BBQ Chicken & Beef. The Loco Moco was great, but I think the BBQ chicken was my favorite (Still debating). We both loved our meals and shared with each other. She is a picky eater, so for her to say it was good really means it was great!   The food was priced appropriately, but better than that, it was a great value, as the portions were so large. My daughter turned her meal into two by eating half a taking the rest home for dinner. I unfortunately, did not have any left to take home.  We will return to Kahuku!!!"}
{"text":"Love the food here, ONE OF best plate lunch IMO... POKE IS THE MOST FRESH!!!... Try the spicy pork my personal fave!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate there. It didn't knock my socks off! He ordered the meat jun and chicken katsu. He liked both and I like the katsu. I ordered the shoyu chicken. I was not impressed. It was more like a gravy! And the spicy ahi poke bowl was pretty skimpy on the ahi and generous on the rice."}
{"text":"Hawaiian spot, not so many selections for a spot like this is a surprise to me. I chose the garlic shrimp. Shrimp are large so it was a plus. Price was ok. Beverage price was a bit much for fountain drink"}
{"text":"A new restaurant opened near my home (Silverado Ranch/ Bermuda).  I am from Hawaii and I love trying new places that serve Hawaiian poke and dishes I'm familiar with from home.  My family and I ordered the meat jun, BBQ chicken, ahi belly and fried noodles and 1/2 lb of their shoyu poke.  As I talked to workers the fish is fresh and it's NEVER frozen.  We eat sushi and poke a lot here in Vegas and this is the first place that I know of that has fresh fish.  The friendly cashier explained to me about their menu and the fresh fish.  Two Thumbs up in my book!!   Due to their soft opening their menu is limited. I will be back soon to try other dishes on their menu.   I am a huge supporter of local businesses."}
{"text":"This place is a total rip off! They gave me the wrong food which I realized when I got home. I took it back and they basically said that it was MY FAULT! I showed them the receipt and they still kept saying I ordered something else. It was crazy. And then they just stared at me and basically said there was nothing they could do. I spent $40 and tipped them. I would think they would want happy customers. Will never go back there. Waste of time and money"}
{"text":"Fast service, I ordered the garlic shrimp and was super excited to try it, only to be disappointed. The shrimp was covered in lemon and butter, I hardly tasted any garlic. The lemon was over powering and lacked garlic! Not sure if I would come back and pay $12 for their shrimp."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful poke, got the shoyu poke bowl and meat-jun.   rice was perfect and the cashier was very pleasant.    Definitely will be a regular here"}
{"text":"Moving from HI to Vegas, I knew I'd miss the food from home. Coming from Hilo where FRESH Ahi is available year 'round, it was nearly impossible to find out here. Being somewhat of a food snob, I can't eat the prev. frozen poke which is pretty much what you'll find all over Vegas. Then Kahuku Poke opens up and FRESH, never frozen ahi poke appears a block away from my house! There IS a God lol!  Everything on the menu tastes just like back home because everyone there IS from home. Chun is an amazing chef, I'm still trying to get her to sell her home-made kimchee, it is AMAZING!  Lilly always greets you with a smile as well as the rest of the friendly staff. Highly recommended for Hawaiians both visiting and living in Vegas. Located two blocks East of SouthPoint casino, just off Silverado ranch. Ample parking right next to the Neighborhood Walmart market."}
{"text":"I had different experience! My husband got me a fish plate. Marinated with soy sauce.. It was extremely salty and smell bad too. Went to trash right away."}
{"text":"Love this place. Foods consistent, friendly employees, clean environment and overall a great place to eat plate lunch Hawaiian kine food!!!"}
{"text":"Poke bowl was really good, I added a bit of spice because I like my food spicy!  Good clean place with good service"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for their soft opening and we were not disappointed. I ordered the shoyu chicken and it was delicious and the portion was worth the price. It came with three chicken thighs. My boyfriend ordered the chicken katsu and mind you he always orders this plate every Hawaiian restaurant we go to, but he was very impressed with their katsu and the sauce.   This place is worth trying and my boyfriend and I will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Ordered garlic shrimp and shoyu poke. Both came with Mac salad and two scoops white rice. $28 total, water to drink. Garlic shrimp was good, not north shore truck good but hey, this is NV not HI. The poke was not delicious. Fish was fresh but sauce was bad. Didn't finish it. Might go back and try katsu or something non-poke. A little disappointing."}
{"text":"Been here twice and I love it! The guy that takes our order is always so nice. He makes sure that he greets the customers and never ignores them. The food here especially their poke is so delicious. I had the spicy poke and the limu poke, and both was super good. Oh! The garlic shrimp is bomb! The only thing is that they close at 8 pm, in which I think is too early here in Vegas. But definitely my top Hawaiian place to go to."}
{"text":"I love Hawaii! nd what I love about Hawaii is their POKE! I had a day off and gave this place a chance and damnnn their POKE broke da mouth!!!!! Soo good! I also had their Tonkatsu! Super crunchy! I ordered the garlic prawns.. i wish they wouldve made it crispier but the flavor was great! Anyways, I will be back on my next day off!"}
{"text":"Their shoyu poke is the worst in vegas only because the cheap nasty shoyu they use! Why! That ruined my poke! Please go back to kikoman or aloha. I know it's a little expensive but the quality will be way better and it will keep people coming back."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a go to for Hawaiian/Korean BBQ. and it looks like they dropped their prices from there opening menu."}
{"text":"Ordered the 'Shoyu poke plate' the MOST DISGUSTING sushi I ever ate. Quality of tuna was horrible, not fresh at all, seem liked expired fish mixed with soy sauce. I eat sushi at least once a week, didn't realized tuna fish had fat it in till this place."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good \"local\" Hawaiian food here in Vegas. I was pulling into another place and saw this was new so decided to give it a try.   I had the meat jun/bbq short rib combo, it was excellent. Reminded of of Dong Yangs in Wahiawa. I also bought some limu poke after talking to one of the workers. They claim the ahi is flown in fresh weekly from the islands, and I believe it. Its definitely not frozen and thawed like many other places around town serve. It's a little pricey but it would have to be to have it flown it. And with how good it is it's worth the price.   Overall a great place, I'll definitely be back. Aloha!"}
{"text":"This is why you never judge a book by its cover.    I was a little hesitant to try this place as the reviews were so so. When trying new places Kahuku never came to mind as it's vet hidden. Out of sight, out of mind.   We had just gone to wellsfargo when babe said hey let's try Kahuku finally. Again I was hesitant, as there were no cars out front and it was that 1pm lunch time.   Walking in the lady at the front greeted us with a friendly hello and asked if we needed any help ordering. We explained it was our first time there and needed a moment. Looking around I noticed it was very clean. Everything on the menu had pictures which I LOVE! I hate ordering somewhere new and not knowing what the food will look like. That's why I love yelp because I scan photos before I go in and order typically. Here it wasn't needed.   We narrowed it down to the poke combo and the spicy pork combo. The lady explained that both combos came with rice, Mac salad and the entrees. I don't remember he priced individually but it totaled to $30 for two combos and two drinks. Not bad. The portions were huge. We asked for it to go.   While we waited for the food we saw lots of cool things. Prices for extras. Desserts in the window that are homemade Hawaiian specialities. They even have prices for catering; small and large pans.   Once at home we chowed down and I can tell you it was delicious. The spicy pork was tender and seasoned to perfection. It tasted saucy yet there was no sauce. So I will assume their marinated it for a long time before cooking it. Poke was yummy too. My fiancée makes poke a lot as he worked for a couple restaurants that made it and he loved it too. Said it tasted very authentic. The Mac salad was perfect. I just wished I had ordered extra! My one years old couldn't get enough and that says a lot"}
{"text":"Not the best poke in Las Vegas...the spicy poke had too much mayo and the chunks of raw fish was small.  Their signature shoyu poke, although it looks good, was bland.  I never went to the location on Oahu so perhaps I should check it out whenever I'm in Hawaii.  But all is not lost, their mochiko chicken is the best, according to my wife, she absolutely loves it!  If it weren't for that, I would've rated it a star less."}
{"text":"First time trying today, friendly cashier. Ordered Meat Jun, 2 item combo of Meat Jun/Chicken Katsu, and Fried Noodles. Meat Jun was delish, the best I've had in my 13 years of being in LV. Better than Jun's & Ross J's. The Katsu sauce was different than any other hawaiian bbq places and the best yet too. Fried Noodles were your typical fried noodles you get in HI. The prices are comparable to where I am from on Kauai. Overall an awesome restaurant. It's a must try but just remember it's their soft opening and menu was limited as of today. I wanted to try a bento and that wasn't ready yet."}
{"text":"Came in with my family around 12 expecting to buy poke and was told that they did not have any poke available at the moment. 10 minutes later, someone else was ABLE to order poke. I ordered #35 (chicken katsu & meat chun bento). Chicken katsu was alright but the sauce wasn't the best (tasted very gingery) & the meat chun had no flavor to it & was very very dry. My dad ordered the roast pork & lau lau combo (roast pork good & fatty). The fried noodles were VERY dry and had ABSOLUTELY NO TASTE TO IT. The Teri beef also had no taste to it & the spicy pork wasn't even spicy. THEY ALSO SERVED ME SPOILED KIM CHEE AND WHEN I TOLD THEM ABOUT IT, THEY DIDNT OFFER TO REFUND ME. Rating it 1 star because the portion size was the only good thing about the place"}
{"text":"Being from Hawaii, I wanted to eat some \"local\" food. I had heard about this place and my daughters and I decided to try it out. We ordered the Meat Juhn and Fried Noodles. Both of which were actually good. Needed to add a bit more of shoyu to the noodles but otherwise pretty good. Serving size was perfect and prices were reasonable. Seating area was spacious. Location is perfect in terms of being located in the Southwest area because a lot of people from Hawaii live out this way. They also have desserts. We had the Chantilly cake and what we would call it back home \"Rainbow Cake\". I would definitely like to go back and try the Teribeef or the Pork Cutlet."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and the food was sub par at best, with the local food competition within the area they really need to step up their game.   The shoyu poke had more onions then fish, the meat jhun was rubbery, the rice was hard, and the macaroni salad was flavorless.   The cashier Jane was very sweet, I had asked her where the owner was, she says the manager is the daughter in law who is running the place, and the owners live in Hawaii.  I expressed my views with her and said there needs someone to taste the food. This place should be packed on the weekend, they're right next to a Walmart, however there were only 2 other people in there waiting for their order."}
{"text":"Very very clean place. The food came clean too. And tasted good. The rice tasted like they washed it. That's very important for me because a lot of places don't wash their rice and you can taste it. I took a peek at the kitchen and it looked clean as well. I would just like to thank them for being one of the few restaurants in Vegas where I go and I actually feel like it's clean"}
{"text":"Happy that this location is closer to my house so I don't have to drive farther to get to Island Flavor!  Prices are reasonable and the poke is fresh as you can expect getting shipped in. The restaurant is clean and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"This spot was recommended by a friend after having a conversation about food being one of the things we miss most about Hawai'i. Apparently it's owned by the same people who own Kahuku Superette located in, you guessed it, Kahuku on Oahu's North Shore. Kahuku Superette is known for some of the best poke on the island and I can definitely vouch for it.   I can't say that this is the best local food I've had while living here in Vegas, but it wasn't terrible. My family and I came on a Saturday afternoon for lunch, which I guess is a bad time to come if you want poke because they had no spicy ahi left. There was only enough left to make the poke bowl that my sister had ordered. The poke is priced a little higher than other places I've been to in the valley, but it was good. I liked that the fish was cut into small pieces.  Meat Jun- It was just okay. The meat was thinly sliced, just how I like it. Pan fried in a traditional sweet egg wash. It definitely needs the sauce that it's served with. I'm disappointed that the rice wasn't sticky. It was rather dry. Mac salad made up for it though! Can't go wrong with mac salad, right?  Fried Noodles- The typical fried saimin noodles with chicken, fish cake, and a variety of veggies mixed in. I wasn't a fan. The dish was extremely bland and the chicken was completely dried out. It needed more than shoyu!  I also ordered a side of kimchi. Don't waste your dollar! The kimchi didn't even look fermented and it lacked that tangy flavor.  If you have room for dessert, I would recommend the guava cake. I don't think it's made in-house and it was a little on the dry side, but it was good and satisfied my sweet tooth after a savory meal.  The menu is reasonably priced and the customer service is great! Overall, a decent place to fulfill your Hawaiian/local food cravings. Kanak attack for sure! If I come back, it'll definitely be to try the garlic shrimp."}
{"text":"That is really good. And they have mini plate for $5.55 , it is good for me cause I can't finish the regular one. It tastes really good."}
{"text":"Soft opening . Limited menu. Only one kind of Poke. Ordered Ahi Belly, Meat Jun and 1/4 pound of poke to try. I have been to the name sake Kuhuku Superette. I lived in Kahuku before moving to Las Vegas. The owner said she only would sell poke by the 1/2 pound. Told her she could keep it. Poke Express is down the road.  Brought the food home. Same sauce used for poke was used as marinade for belly.  It was over cooked also came with one scoop of rice and bland macaroni salad, Kim chee, and pickled radish $13.95. Meat Jun fell apart. Breading was just falling off same composed dish as Ahi. $9.95. Too little food for the money. Never saw any sign to make aware of the minimum purchase of Poke. Stupid to begin with. There is no try before you buy on that either. I got so many other places to go. Don't believe I'll ever come back here. I tried to talk to the owner, but she was adamant it's her restaurant.  I agree ...it's your restaurant and it's my money, I'll take my money else where. I said this before I will say it again. Great Customer service will always make up for food short comings. This place lacks both."}
{"text":"Service was good place was clean. I ordered tako poke and it was a little icy which I didn't like. The shoyu poke was way too salty. Plus it's pricy. I prefer island sushi poke."}
{"text":"Vegas strip prices at an off the strip location. Ouch.  A regular combo at this Hawaiian / poke establishment can set you back $15 a plate for two meats.   A more reasonable bento box option will still cost you $10.     As far as the poke goes, there are better options here in Vegas.  I found their shoyu poke to be overly salty with a bit of a spicy kick by the chopped onions added.  What I didn't like about this place was the inability to sample the poke prior to purchasing.   I was told it had to be made to order but shouldn't you have at least samples to allow customers to try before they buy?  I expect the best especially at a price of $19 per pound.  Finishing the last piece of tuna did not leave me satisfied.   The bento box we ordered included small portions of each of meat jun, kalbi short ribs, and bbq chicken.  The macaroni salad and kimchee accompanied the warm noodles to complete the meal.    I could not care for their kimchee as it was dry and did not seem fresh at all.  The macaroni salad was average at best.  The meats were good but other places would give double the meat at that price.    I have to deduct one star because the value is not here.  You simply aren't getting your money's worth. A second star because ordering is quite painful.  Their posted menu above had text literally using maybe 12 or 14 pt Times New Roman font.  It's really small to see even right in front of the counter.  My wife gave up trying to figure out the difference between #34, #35, and #36.  A 3rd star gone because the selection of poke was lacking.  Spicy tuna poke or shoyu poke.  Little options and average flavor.   It was funny watching people in line squinting at the menu above.   Okay!  That's it.  The search for better poke continues..."}
{"text":"It was a pretty far out drive for me but the food was almost worth it. Not as many options on the menu that I expected but it was yummy. I did like that they have fresh poke it's really hard to find that out here in Vegas. I'll definitely go back only when I'm really craving some ono poke."}
{"text":"Had the garlic shrimp here and it was good! I back this spot . Never had the poke but if it's Hawaiian style it can't be bad"}
{"text":"I couldn't believe it when I drove past the sign. Kahuku Poke? As in the infamous Kahuku Poke from Oahu, Hawaii?   You betcha. This is the place. They use the same recipe as the tried and true famous Hawaiian Poke stop, Kahuku Superette. And if you're from Hawaii, you know their Poke is legendary.  Also available (other than Poke) is your traditional Hawaiian Barbecue fare. The portions are HUGE and come with your usual two scoop rice and mac salad. The musubis here remind me of the genuine kind I can find in Hawaii, complete with Saran Wrap.  Portions are very well priced and the poke is worth it. If I close my eyes and ignore the desert heat, I'd have sworn I was on the North Shore of Oahu."}
{"text":"tldr  The unagi was just decent with a lot of bones. The sauce faired well with the rice and unagi but it was just not that great and pretty pricey for the amount served.  Got: -unagi bowl: eh"}
{"text":"The service was okay and the food was okay too. I'm a food lover and I always love to try new restaurants whenever I have time. I expected a lot from this Hawaiian poke since I love poke. So I ordered poke shoyu today and I wasn't impressed. The price was reasonable \"I guess\" but I think they can do better with the taste."}
{"text":"Recently came here to get lunch for my boss and I since we wanted Hawaiian food. The meat Jun was pretty good and the portion is a good size. My boss got the 1lb ahi poke. I liked that they were just freshly cutting the ahi but I'm taking a star since the seasoning has not really soaked into the fish yet when I got it. Overall good food and will come back :)"}
{"text":"I love poke and was excited try this place but $20 for a plate of poke rice and scoop of mac salad is beyond me. Now normally i wouldnt care but it wasnt that great. The Limu was extremely salty! Almost unbearable. Service was fine. Food was fast but i cant get over my salty poke. Sad."}
{"text":"First Time here an I should say I was impressed. The quality is there the portion is perfect. The menu is not over done like some Hawaiian establishment that I've been to here in Vegas. Over all a nice place to have a meal!"}
{"text":"Good food... Leewards style mochiko chicken plate,  kahuku shrimp truck style garlic shrimp, kahuku superette poke (wish it was pre made to soak the shoyu) other then that it was yummy!"}
{"text":"First time, we got kalbi (beef short rib) plate and garlic shrimp plate and one Hawaiian sun $28 frickin nuts! I felt like it was way too expensive. The kalbi was good but only Gave 3 pieces, for 12$ 4 short ribs would have been better. Plate lunch comes with side Mac salad and kimchee. Mac salad was bland lacking in flavor, kim chee didn't taste fresh. I was disappointed in my garlic shrimp. No Garlic flavor, drenched in butter like soaked. I tasted more lemon butter flavor than garlic. To me growing up in Hawaii, I'm sorry it did not taste like back home. Good service, Clean. Since they are new I'll give them a second chance, but I will never order the shrimp again. Good marketing, they give you one free TSHIRT!!"}
{"text":"I love their food, the only reason I don't come here more often is because I'm on a diet. Otherwise, the staff here is nice and they automatically know my order. Place is clean also."}
{"text":"Quick service with ver tasty food. I had garlic shrimp and it was delicious. Very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Average at best.  I thought I would try this place since its new.  The Tako Poke was pretty decent, but not great.  The spicy pork was awful!  I don't see me returning here.  I'm more likely to go Poke Express instead."}
{"text":"The finest Poke in Vegas.  I have been to many poke places and I would have to say this is the Creme de la Creme.  Exceptionally fresh and not previously frozen. The first bite took me back to Hawaii.  Ahi is fresh, Limu is fresh, and perfectly seasoned...Broke da mouth!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and the food is ono and the poke is fresh.  A place I would come back to when I'm down on the Southside."}
{"text":"I've eaten from here about 3 times now and I've never been disappointed. I always order take out and the staff has always been nice, patient and super helpful. I literally get the same thing every time i come here so I don't know how helpful this review is lol. I always get the bibimbap(sp?) and usually an extra 1/4 pound of shoyu ahi to go with it. The fish is always fresh and I've had no issues with it. The rice, cabbage and seaweed in the bibimbap is always amazingly delicious and fresh as well. All in all I'd say this place is solid but like I mentioned earlier, I haven't tried anything else from here and might never because I enjoy what I order so much. I've also never eaten in the sit down area but as far as looks go, it's casual dining! Super clean too."}
{"text":"Onolicious ! Loved the shoyu poke - MP - but great quality. BBQ combo excellent, Lau Lau good Hoping they will have poi and chili pepper water next visit. Gonna go back for sure and try the bentos and lots more."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously good. I had the short ribs and the chicken katsu and both were fantastic. Best lunch I've had in a long time"}
{"text":"Try the Tuna Poke! The cashier even offered us a sample tasting of the salmon poke which was also tasty but as usual we went with our favorite the ahi poke. The prices here are a little more than the average Hawaiian spot around Vegas but the portions are way bigger! My boyfriend and I got the ahi poke bowl, short ribs and pork Katsu! Yum and we were sooo full! We can't wait to go back for the poke bowls again! The place is clean and the cashier was very sweet and informative. We got there around 6:30 and while we were eating the place got pretty busy, you'll have a little bit of a wait for your food but it's most definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Never had this type of food in the past but it was great. Totally recommend the spicy poke with white rice or even the amazing garlic shrimp, which was amazing. Stop by if you're in the area. The people here are great"}
{"text":"Kahuku Poke is a typical Hawaiian style take out restaurant. There is zero pizzazz.   Kahuku Poke is my go to place for lunch. It's quick and in expensive. And if I like, I can order coco puffs to take home for dinner. They also have chantilly cake, my favorite although I haven't had Kahuku's cake just yet.  Any times, I've ordered the fried noodles plate because it's my all time favorite dish. As consistent as the dish is, I found that sometimes the noodles are over cooked and a little burnt and the chicken over cooked and dry. The noodles come with nothing else so I do order a side of Mac salad. It comes in a tiny dipping sauce container which is fine by me as I need just a taste of it. And it is reasonably priced at $.85.   It's an ordinary experience with Kahuku Poke which I am fine with as I tend to prefer an uneventful and quiet lunch before heading back to crazy amounts of work waiting for me at the office."}
{"text":"Recently moved to the mainland from Hawaii so was craving some local food. My first visit, ordered the Spicy Ahi Bowl. The bowl literally came with just rice and ahi. Felt like it was missing some greens as a bowl in Hawaii comes with veggies, but it's ok, the flavor of the ahi was good and spicy! I also tried the Kalbi, that was so good too, the perfect amount of fat and chared flavor, just like back home. Oh and we also ordered quarter pound of the Ahi Poke - sooo ono, melt in your mouth, fish is fresh!!"}
{"text":"I love Poke so much. I remember when they first opened last year and I wanted to try this place so bad. But then I saw all the reviews on Yelp saying \"Their Poke tasted the worst.\" and \"The service was terrible.\" That made me stay away from this place. Today, I was in this neighborhood so I did a quick Yelp search. I stumbled upon this review saying \"Their garlic shrimp tasted like \"Giovanni's shrimp truck\" in HI. OMG, I freaking love Giovanni's!!! I had to come here.  Garlic shrimp... YES!!!! Very close to what I had from Giovanni's. Strong garlic flavor and buttery sauce. A hint of lemon (very slight). Of course, I like Giovanni's better but their garlic shrimp made me satisfied. Now I don't miss Giovanni's as much as I did before. Thanks to Jade T. for the review!!  Salmon Poke... Thank God I got the poke sauce on the side. Their salmon poke was as good as Poke express. Very fresh and delicious!! But their sauce... Umm, I'm not a fan of their sauce at all. Did they put salt in soy sauce? Tasted very weird. I used my own soy sauce and it was so much better. Same price as Poke express but I would get salmon poke at Poke express because their special sauce that comes with salmon poke is delicious.   Definitely coming back for their garlic shrimp!! My new favorite spot!! The service was not bad at all. Same shopping center as Walmart neighborhood market. Right next to UPS store."}
{"text":"Musubi, poke, seaweed salad and kimchi for lunch with scoop white rice!   The tastes of the islands!   What a treat!"}
{"text":"since we love poke and this place is just like a mile from the house we REALLY REALLY wanted to like it... the first time we went in to check it out was a couple of months ago and we had a weird feeling about it bc they were out of alot of items, the prices wer super high and the girl at the register made us more confused than ever.  so we didnt order anything, kindly took a to go menu and said \"thanku we'll be back\" ... today we came back :/  this is another lesson in why you should always trust your first instinct bc intuition is almost always right! i had the salmon and tuna poke (.3 cup of each) and a cup of rice, husband had the bento box w/spam, beef and chicken.  the poke was ok, the beef tasted boiled and was just meh... not worth it..."}
{"text":"Ate here today.  My cousins and I met here to celebrate my birthday.   Not a big selection from the menu.  However, I had the Laulau plate and it was excellent.  Best laulau I have eaten compared to all the Hawaiian restaurants I have been to.  Lomi and Kim Chee was ok."}
{"text":"I walked in here today after playing with yelp and seeing that this place was just across the way from where I was. Score! I was super excited to try a new Hawaiian spot in this part of town... And THEN I saw Poke on the menu and was sold and had to rush over! Once I got there I was barely greeted however there were many employees... They seem to only sell tuna & tako poke as bowls/meals and I was just looking for a snack and asked if they could weigh it out and if I can buy it like so... No problem... Except there's only two sizes, ok that's fine... Now the gentleman and the lady helping me both seemed to be on completely different pages and the whole excitement of trying the new potential poke spot became stressful. I let them know if it was too complicated that it's totally OK and that I don't NEED a snack/meal/food but simply saw them on yelp and wanted to give them a try... Gentleman says something along the lines of no problem we can do a half for you but then the Korean lady follows up saying something entirely different in regards to the order and well... Sadly, I did not try the new poke spot... But I saw some great menu items and I understand this is a new joint and wish them the very best! The restaurant looked very clean and at the register there were spam musubi's and kimchi which I love both... So perhaps with some time they will all get on the same page and deliver better customer service to not have a potential customer walk. I will be back! And hopefully will be able to change this reviews rating!  Till then I'll make the trip to Hawaiian Style Poke."}
{"text":"Thank you for delivering (Postmates) my yummy lunch... my BBQ short ribs are delicious...."}
{"text":"First time here...I actually came here because when I found this place online, it had pics of long johns, but when I asked to order some,  she said they discontinued it a long time ago. So we figure we'll just eat dinner here, took a lil while to order cuz nothing really caught my eye. Some of the items were out.  I ended up getting the roast pork and my son got the mochiko chicken.  Opened up my plate and, DAMN it looked good! Took a bite and no flavor... disappointing, pork was tough, gravy no flavor, mac salad was too firm and the rice was borderline of being too hard.  Locals know hard rice throws off the whole meal.  My son's plate same thing...2 stars is because the mochiko chicken was ok.  He and I ended up sharing his chicken... ONLY the chicken.  It might not be fair that I give only 2 stars because I didn't get to try everything, and I'm sure there's stuff on the menu that's ono, but first impressions is everything. It didn't give me that \"wow\" factor where I'd tell people they gotta try this place"}
{"text":"Love the roast pork! Must try! This place have the best roast pork in Vegas no joke!  It's a bit pricey but way worth it.  If your a pork fan try it and trust me it is soooo good! Also the fried noodles is sooooo good as well reminds me of Hawaiian fried noodles! Ask them to put spam mo betta!"}
{"text":"A lot of fatty meat. Most of my meat portion was not edible. Not worth the price, I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"I spent the New Years Holiday weekend in Enterprise, Nevada with my family and happened upon this local joint, Kahuku Poke and Hawaiian Barbeque.  I was so excited to see that this was the real deal poke, just like I used to get back home.  The restaurant was decked out Hawaiian style, and the seats and tables were comfy.  The first day we tried this place I ordered the Limu Poke plate, a little pricey but still cheaper than a plane ticket home.  Kahuku Poke did not short this limu poke because it was exactly the same as I remembered growing up in Hawaii.  We loved this place so much we ended up coming everyday before we left.  Their saimin is the S&S brand, yep, hard to find in the bay.  The saimin, or most commonly known by the haoles as ramen, was authentic, it hit the spot especially after we had a night of too much drinking.  The staff there were very friendly, just like being back home, service with a smile.  My sisters had the Kalua Pork and Lau Lau plate and they loved it.  My sisters boyfriend had the Shoyu Poke plate and he loved it so much.    I've tried many places around the Bay area that serves \"Hawaiian Style\" poke but you know something's wrong when the description of the poke included avocado!  What?  Who puts avocado in Hawaiian poke?  lol  PS - try the Paradise cake, you will think you're back at De Lite Bakery, really!"}
{"text":"Poke was ok!  Loco moco was not what I was used to.  Was greasy and a \"grey gravy\"  not brown.  Kalbi was prob the only thing I would order again."}
{"text":"Their portions are huge and worth the price!! The only down fall was they were out of limu for their poke and I was really looking forward to it."}
{"text":"I threw up... that's how nasty it was! Hair in my order, terrible tasting sauce covering the shoyu poke, and the ahi just didn't seem like a good cut. Also, something hard was covering the fish and it wasn't the sesame seeds: hard enough to hurt my teeth. Macaroni salad was decent though. Eat here at your own desperation!"}
{"text":"That was shoyu chicken? It was probably the worst I've ever had. But the absolute worst part of our visit was the prices. Seriously, this place is located in a strip mall, next to Walmart and they have the nerve to charge what they're charging??? Especially when you take into account that the food doesn't even remotely taste like the food back home in Hawaii.   My daughter ordered a combo plate and I ordered the shoyu chicken. We had two drinks. Our bill was almost $30. Yes, I am serious.  I was born and raised in Hawaii so maybe I'm spoiled but to me the food was horrid. I gave it one more star than I should have because the girl at the counter, while pretty dense (she forgot one of our orders), was exceptionally friendly."}
{"text":"DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT for the love of God, go here for Poke. This was the worst poke I have ever tasted. Even I make it better. 1) there were no sesame oil or sesame seeds and 2) while shit, all that damn salt that's in there!! It's insane! It tastes nothing like how poke should taste. If you want good poke, go to Island Sushi. They have various types of poke to choose from.   My bf ordered the shoyu poke plate and I ordered the bbq chicken with a 1/4lb side of limu poke. All that came out to $33. The only thing that was good was my bbq chicken. We had to throw the rest away.   The poke made the bf sick that when we got home he passed out for a few hours.   We will never come here again."}
{"text":"Tried this place one more time after their grand opening.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The shoyu poke was much better this time.  No scales.  No major stringy pieces.  Still pretty darn tasty.  My daughter had the meat jun and from what I am told it was tasty.  Although their prices are still quite HI (yes pun intended)... What do you expect for landlocked Las Vegas?  I will need to try some other things on the menu!    If the owners are reading this - as a friendly touch to the female cashier and the older gentlemen cleaning up... You can talk to the customers!  Because if you don't it just makes you seem unfriendly.  A hello and goodbye, and an occasional thank you would be great.  Just a thought."}
{"text":"I went here for poke, and walked out without trying any. Instead, I ordered the combo chicken katsu, BBQ chicken, and spicy pork plate. The price is a bit steep for what they give you. One piece of spicy pork. What?  Katsu was good, but I did not like their katsu sauce very much, but that's because I'm very used to the typical standard. Theirs is a bit different. The breading was good, and I enjoyed it. The BBQ chicken is a definite must. I liked it the most out of the three.   Spicy pork was really off on flavor. I was expecting a korean standard spicy pork marinade but it was 1) not spicy at all 2) a different cut of meat than I expected 3) flavor had some sour vinegary taste that I was put off by, it just was not good. Definitely nothing like the spicy pork you'd expect at a korean restaurant.   I let the cashier know, and thankfully she went out of her way to do a taste test. Too bad that they stopped making it spicy to cater to the \"American\" taste buds due to some complaints. \"American\" people complaining about something being spicy when it's called \"spicy pork.\" Tickles my fancy. Either way, they seem to respond very well to their customer's comments, almost to a fault. There will always be someone that isn't going to be happy with the food. But I say bring back that spice level for the spicy pork. It's like Mc Donald's has warned you the coffee is HOT coffee. Well, I'd say people have been warned plenty if it says, \"spicy pork.\"   Now your combo plate will not come with kimchi because of some complaint that they were served kimchi that went \"bad.\" And apparently a lot of people waste it and throw it out. What a bummer. It's super rare to eat \"spoiled\" kimchi because it's fermented. That's like saying I had \"spoiled\" pickles. Now how often does that happen?  The service was great, and the cashier was super nice. So yeah, didn't get that poke because the price was crazy for the small size. The marinade for their BBQ chicken is one of the best I've ever had. It was perfect and had a great char. Not too salty, not too sweet, it was super balanced."}
{"text":"When I am away from home (Oahu), I miss my poke.  First off, I would NOT eat any fish that is previously frozen, it must be FRESH.  I love the fact that their fish is FRESH.  If you are from Hawaii, its a must for you to try it!  For those that can't tell the difference between FRESH and frozen go to the cheap places."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, menu is kind of limited but overall staff are friendly, right down the street from me so it's very convenient"}
{"text":"A friend told us to try this poke restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised that it is a full Hawaiian restaurant with everything from poke, eat jun, chicken katsu, fried saimin, musubis, Loco moco, etc.  We ordered  spicy poke and shoyu poke - both were excellent.   The Shoyu poke is their signature dish and it does not disappoint.  It has a great tasting bold sauce.  The fish is sooo good.  I have had poke all over town, this is the freshest tasting poke in Las Vegas.   You can definitely tell this is fresh and has NOT been frozen.  We also ordered meat jun, bbq chicken,  chicken katsu,  and fried saimin.  The portions are gigantic.   My meat jun/katsu combo was large enough for 3 people.  You should ask for the spicy meat jun sauce.  The staff is very very friendly.   They were very helpful and always smiling.  We will definitely be back to try some other items like the Ahi Bibimbab."}
{"text":"Just opened 3weeks ago with limited menu like everyone said. Only available poke was their Shoyu(supposedly their best from what the cashier said), very bland and disappointing. Im kinda afraid to try the other style poke. I also had the fish jun which was the first time I've had it super greasy, fish was very thick and again, bland.  Their sauce was also more on the shoyu jalapeño side which was new to me.     I hate to say but if you want poke go to island sushi just down the road. Thank me later. Still undecided if I'll be back or not."}
{"text":"I like this place! It's your standard poke/Hawaiian BBQ place. There's nothing that really stands out about it, but it is consistent. I find that all these new poke places have a lot of extra \"fluff\" which kind of takes away from the simple quality of a Hawaiian poke restaurant. When food is this good you don't need a ton of toppings/sauces etc. They have a variety of poke bowls or plates that come with macaroni salad and 2 scoops of rice. It is a little pricier than other poke places I've been to but you get a ton of food so it is definitely worth it. I've only ever have had their shoyu spicy poke and it is great. It is perfectly seasoned and comes with huge chunks of tuna. They also have your standard Hawaiian food items like loco moco and spam musubi. Food is 10/10, service.. not so much. I'm not sure if the girl working was having a bad day but she wasn't very pleasant. No \"hi how are you\". Just stood there and waited for my order and wasn't even willing to help when I was confused about different meal options. Hopefully she was just having an off day because I plan on returning."}
{"text":"If I want Poke, I go to a place with Poke in it's name.. and expect it to be good! On a recommendation of a co-workers, I've gone here a few times and found it it meet expectations.  Poke is expensive.. but I'm happy to pay for quality and freshness which this place seems to have. My go to is the small poke bowl of either Shoyu or Limu. It's big enough to fill me up for lunch.  I haven't tried the rest of their menu yet but I will be sure to do so soon.  I also like that there are no long lines and parking is plentiful.. also no traffic to get here!"}
{"text":"Had the 3 meat combo of Meat Jun, Kalbi, Shoyu Chicken ($15) and half pound Shoyu Poke ($10). Very comparable to most Hawaiian style places, none really stood out and was more on the bland side if anything. Drove half hour and went there about 2 weeks ago and can say it still is on the way to make it a good place or will fall like any other plate lunch joint. The prices are not your typical plate lunch price (high) but poke is about the going rate. When you up charge for not bad but not great food only hurts the patrons in 2 ways: would you go out of the way to get it? Is it worth what you pay for if you can go somewhere else for the same items? They should probably downsize the menu and create more consistent choices because that's what it tasted like, something sitting because it's on the menu and not so much an item that's freshly made to order. Overall clean restaurant and kinda friendly staff and would probably try it one more time if we're in the near area."}
{"text":"on a slow day..take so damn long for your food!!..super disappointed!!..slakin big tym!"}
{"text":"The corner of Bermuda and Silverado is the place to be. Fresh&Easy, Walmart Neighborhood Market, Bank of America, Eco Cleaners, 7-11... I am always driving by or going to one of these places when running errands.  I decided to try Kahuku Poke the other day after staring at it every time I stopped by Walmart for the past few weeks. I got a 1/2 lb of the Shoyu Poke to go and it was a little shy of $10. I recall the lady working the register to be pleasant and it only took minutes to receive my order!  The tuna is marinated in a nicely seasoned soy sauce based ponzu sauce with sliced onion and chopped green onion and is INCREDIBLY soft!! It is marinated to perfection - the tuna literally just melts in your mouth. Tuna is cubed into large pieces and only a very few (bound to happen) had a chewy white stringiness to it.  The tuna tasted fresh and not at all fishy. (Later found out they never use frozen fish, it's always fresh and shipped in daily!) It's a little pricy for the portion but not at all an issue because I was thoroughly satisfied with the taste. I look forward to trying their other poke next time!"}
{"text":"First time here and i was surprised by the price of there food !  i had the lau lau and pork roast combo and a small drink for 17$ ? No thanks!! Food was dry! Its not worth it!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant very clean. I had the garlic shrimp plate and it tasted like when I visited Hawaii. Brought back memories from my fond vacation. Due to soft opening I'm looking forward to grand opening. The staff was so friendly and welcoming.."}
{"text":"\"Quality is the recipe\"  this is the mindset when it comes to their ahi poke @ Kahuku. Today I came for lunch and was sadly disappointed to find out they were closed on Monday. I was craving it so much so I went to a competitor and that's where I made the mistake. After the first bite I knew I definitely should of waited.   Ever since I found out about kahuku, I've been coming at least a few times a day. Literally!   The Meat-jun and the limu ahi poke are my go-to plus a side of macaroni salad. Bam!  Big boy plate and the owner looks at me like I've never eaten in my life. Lol   That's my style. Once I find something good I eat it so much until I get sick of it. But to be honest. This might take a while. Its a little bit pricey but it's so good and healthy. Oh well, at least it's not some greasy fried food that's taste good but bad for you health wise. Eat well & Mahalo my friends!"}
{"text":"I have came here multiple times during their soft opening and have had a wonderful experience! I understand that it was a soft opening and their would be a limited menu to choose from but that was ok with me! When I walked in the restaurant was very clean and presented very nicely. The menu was easily seen and pictures were displayed. The first thing I ordered here was the small shoyu poke, it was seasoned nicely on a bed of rice and extremely fresh! No frozen fish here! I literally saw them carving up a big tuna through their window, now that's fresh. The next time I came in and tried the meat-jun. it's was incredible! Thinly sliced beef in and egg wash and pan friend served over rice with their delicious spicy soy sauce and kim chi. I will defiantly be back to try out other dishes as well as different types of poke when they arrive! And don't forget the different varieties of Hawaiian sodas they have also."}
{"text":"Not too big a fan of the poke. Shoyu was insanely salty. Spicy tuna wasn't good. They marinade the tuna with shoyu before mixing in with the spicy mayo. And it makes the tuna look brown which is displeasing."}
{"text":"Got samples they gave us smaller than a penny sized for me and my boyfriend to share. SHOYU POKE was horrible, overly salty. The poke itself is not prepared right, very chewy. Maybe the other items are much better but skip this place for their poke. Fish tasted like it wasn't fresh"}
{"text":"I'm glad I took a chance on this place despite some 1 star reviews. We've been out here for a year and this is the FIRST place that had FRESH POKE. true to kahuku superette. Exactly....I REPEAT... EXACTLY how fresh poke is SUPPOSED TO TASTE!  Simple. Good. Ingredients."}
{"text":"I always get the meat jun here cuz it's so good. There are only about 3 places that serve meat jun that are bomb; This is one of the best for the price.  Well basically everything you get here is good but just ask what type of fish they are using for the fish Katsu since it changes at times.  The poke though brings back the feels of beach days on the north shore of Oahu in Hawaii. The sauce is the same recipe as the Kahuku Superette in Hawaii. It's unique from all other poke shops which makes it really good.  If you like L&L type of stuff this one will be so much better, price and amount of food wise."}
{"text":"Ahhhhhhh finally found some tako poke. Been over 20 years since I last ate some before I left Hawaii to come home to Cali . Well here's my review...loved it has more selection than L&L or Ono's.....I give them 3.5 stars... Kahuku u get 5...u made my belly happy nd brought back some memories.. Ok folks I'm getting kanak attack gotta go aloha"}
{"text":"Worst food I had. Worst flavors. Nothing like Kahuku Poke back home. Will not be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It has some of the best poke outside of Hawaii. The BBQ chicken and spicy chicken is great. My son loved the loco moco. The service was excellent and the prices are good. It is definitely a place to try out. We'll be back to try some more offerings from their menu."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since this little spot opened. I like to try different \"Hawaii Style Local Cuisine\" for the various reasons. One reason is that I am far away from home and if it is one thing I do miss..I miss the food. Comforting, filling and can turn a bad day good. I can tell you that this place hits the spot when I'm missing home for comfort food. I have to say that I'm not a \"foodie\" so if you are huge on 5 course meals...fancy places ...top chefs and Zagat recommendations then maybe you should skip my review. This place gets 5 stars because  I can tell you that this place gives great service, the girl at the counter is always friendly and remembers me each time I place an order. The food quality has been consistent each time I order. The place is clean and welcoming just like I would find back home. Food presentation is pretty good and the price is perfect."}
{"text":"Love this place!  This place definitely has the best pokè in Las Vegas. Everyone is so nice there!"}
{"text":"Spicy poke is way too drenched in sauce. The place is also expensive. I'd rather go to poke express on eastern. Atleast their poke bowl is larger and cheaper. Also it's tastier. My first and last visit to this place."}
{"text":"This is not anything like kahuku! Or Hawaii for that matter. Disappointed that they used the kahuku name to get you in."}
{"text":"I'm so glad they opened this poke shop next to our house!!!  I miss poke so much since we moved to the mainland...I'm glad this is so close  Service: is amazing always very friendly reminds me of the island, talk to the OG auntie my first time here, she is the bomb!  Poke: first time here they had a limited menu and where out of spicy poke...even on the islands if you didn't get there island you weren't getting the good poke so people crying about them being out of poke is on them....if you are from the island you know you have to get there early to get the poke you want....the shoyu  poke was bomb better then I thought...today we tried the spicy poke and it was good, but I have had better.  Complaints: for a local shop who got huge from the locals, kinda crazy they don't have kama'aina or even military discount.  Keep the good work going and the yummy poke and we will keep coming!"}
{"text":"Love the local selection! Garlic shrimp... poi... coco puff.... meat jun.. katsu... guava cake! And the Mac salad is the most accurate to Hawaii! We will come back again a and again! Plus had choke locals inside to talk story with."}
{"text":"Love it here! the girls are so sweet and I've ordered often enough that they know me. it's not the best in town but it sure beats having to go 2 miles to the next one when I only have 30 minutes for lunch. And they are much better than some of the lnls I've had with no sauce on the bbq beef."}
{"text":"Hawaiian food is everywhere in Vegas and so are poke places.  The only reason why I would go here is because Kahuku is one of the few places that serve garlic shrimp just like in the North Shore. While it's not perfect, it fulfills my cravings for Giovanni's. There's hella garlic, maybe a little too much and a shitload of buttah.  Their shoyu poke is decent here too.  *****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge***** 74/100"}
{"text":"First time order food from this place..Love the meat Jun and the chow mein.big potions . will  recommend to all my friends"}
{"text":"Visited my mom in Vegas and I told my mom I was craving some poke, she took us here and I really enjoyed their shoyu poke even though the price was a bit too steep. I will come back again but maybe to just buy half pound, 1 lb was about $20."}
{"text":"Each time I try to eat here it's just bad timing. The first time I came in they were closed luring late lunch due to something occurring in their restaurant, my second time coming in is at 8:30pm where they're closed but on Yelp it says they close at 9pm, my third and probably last attempt I come in at 8:15pm and got turned away because that's their last call time since they close at 8:30pm.   I came in after a lady did and they took her order and declared her as the last customer they will be serving. Initially when I came in I did hear one of the employee's sigh as if it was a burden to come in 15 minutes before closing. Then the other employee starts shaking her head saying, \"sorry we are closed.\" I pulled out my phone and was like, \"closed at 8:15?!\" and they said it was their last call time. It's frustrating. Don't put on the door that you're closed at 8:30pm, just say 8:15pm so it doesn't waste people's time coming in."}
{"text":"Discovered this place while driving by. My fiancé  ordered the chicken Katsu and bbq chicken combo for 12.95. I ordered the lau lau plate. Both plates came with side of kimchi, Mac salad and rice. The portions are small. The bbq chicken came with one piece of chicken and the Katsu had one piece as well. The lau lau was bland and there was not any pork fat( my favorite part of lau lau). We are frequent customers to L n L and I was disciplined. The prices are higher and the amount of food is less. Although the food was ok, the customer service was excellent."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch didn't order any poke. Just wanted meat Jun and Kalbi. But again I ordered 3 plates. Dam those tastebuds when they can't get along.  Anyway the meat Jun was delicious so was the Kalbi. The Bbq chicken and Mac salad were good. The Mac was a little plain but not horrible.   The laulau and Kalua pig were both moist and flavor full ,so no complaints from the family there. The only disappointment here was the lomi wasn't very fond of it.  I ordered the saimin also and ate the whole thing. Not to salty like some of the others out there. So I enjoyed it.  The staff were great and helpful. So no complaints here."}
{"text":"For all that say it's gotta be fresh it's very rare that good ahi is not flash frozen at sea and kept froze prior to using.  FYI"}
{"text":"Meat jun was really good just the prices was too extreme for a plate. The poke was over priced everything was actually over priced , not even a 5 star restaurant and prices aren't reasonable ."}
{"text":"This place over priced..ordered the spicey poke and felt as if they are hiding the quality of fish with over saucing it..THERE ARE WAY BETTER OPTIONS..they will out price themselves out business - $20 a pound"}
{"text":"Went here and thought the prices were outrageous but when I received my meal... Omg! It was so much food that me,  my wife and daughter couldn't finish e the mix combo plate... I definitely give this place 5 stars since food was good amount for the price and also quality was the best!"}
{"text":"Small portions for the price. Lau lau was small and did not have butterfish as advertised.   Poke was fresh but very salty."}
{"text":"Great location and friendly staff.  Prices are fairly steep, but all poke in Las Vegas are all fairly steep.  At first the portions was a little small for the price, but as I kept going and making this spot a weekly visit for lunch, and getting to know the staff a little more, they start hooking it up with a little extra more poke :)  I wish they had a stamp card or something to get free poke.. one day maybe?"}
{"text":"They didn't have ahi poke because the shipment was bad but the Korean ribs and garlic shrimp were pretty good! Not as good as the food trucks in Hawaii but pretty close! Friendly staff and clean hole in the wall place off of the strip!"}
{"text":"I usually get their bbq chicken and kalbi plate.. it's really good and a good sized portion. Their loco mock is really good too, taste home cooked. I do also enjoy their shoyu poke rice bowl but I wish they put a bit more poke.. I get it poke/sushi is expensive but the rice to fish ratio seems off to me. It's really good and fast, I go here quite often since it is right around the corner.. I wish they were open 10 well at least 9 every night and every time I think about going to get it they're closed. Try this place out if you like Hawaiian food, definitely a good spot to grab some ono grinds."}
{"text":"This  is one of the best Hawaiian restaurant on my side of town.  I usually come in here for lunch. I have had their bento box before and it was pretty good. Today I just stopped in for a Spam Musubi, macaroni salad, and to finally try a slice of guava cake.    The location is pretty quiet. I've never seen a crowd inside. I've never taken it as a bad thing because I have never had to wait for my order for too long. The people have always been nice. The only downside is that they charge $0.50 for credit card usage under $10.   The one thing I have not yet tried is there poke. I've been told it's pretty good so I do plan to try it. I recommend giving this place a try if you are on this side of town."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience here. Hands down, the best poke in Vegas. I'm from Hawaii so I know how good poke taste like. Apparently the owner of this joint is also the same owner of kahuku superette back on Oahu, the poke at kahuku superette is one of the best on the island. I just wish the spicy ahi was more fresh, but can't really complain much since we don't leave near an ocean.   I don't know why a lot of people are complaining about the price. I think it's reasonable & you get what you pay for (in a good way). Most plate lunch places back home range about the same price. I also know that fresh Ahi is limited in Vegas so of course they would need to up the price.   I ordered the Kalbi, BBQ chicken, shoyu poke, spicy ahi, and meat jun. They all tasted really good. Better than L&L in my opinion. They gave a generous amount of meat and 2 scoops of rice with Mac salad.   The employees were really nice and sweet on top of that. I only waited less than 10min max for my order. I'm planning on visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"Clean as heck, super friendly local aunties working the register and Foodland tier spicy Tako poke (#1 in my book), what more can I ask for! The place playing Hawaiian music over the speakers brings it all home."}
{"text":"Poke and Barbecue was delicious. I loved their employees when I came in for a visit.    I ordered the barbecue short ribs and it was an outstanding experience! Their rips (although difficult to cut around all those bones), you will taste tender, delicious , mouth watering meat, that will make you go back for more.  Get a small cup for free refills."}
{"text":"We went back to give them another try and it was Amazing! We ordered the bbq chicken and bbq beef combo. Plenty to share with my partner! Cashier or owner remembered me and told me thank you for giving them another chance.  Next chance Poke and I will tell my Hawaii Friends."}
{"text":"I have to agree the prices were a bit high for the quantity of food. They did not have everything available. One menu on the wall is different than the one by the register. It was a disappointing experience. Not sure I would go back"}
