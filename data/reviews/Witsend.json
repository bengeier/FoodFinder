{"text":"Great atmosphere, good selection of beers and drinks too. Known for long waits to be served, it's not unheard of to wait an hour or more for your meal. Fish n chips are great but everything else is just alright. Unfortunately do not get the quality of food for the price you pay. Aparently you can get a free lunch on your birthday,  so that would be a good time to try it out to see what you think."}
{"text":"L'ambiance est bien, on y sert de la bonne bière.  La bouffe est généralement savoureuse.  Les fish&chips et les côtes levées étaient très bon."}
{"text":"A popular lunch spot for motorcyclists, Witsend is your typical irish pub with typical pub food. Don't expect to be wow'ed with the food -- it is not bad per se, but its nothing spectacular. Prices are on the high side for this quality, perhaps due to the popularity of the place."}
