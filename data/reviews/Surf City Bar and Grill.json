{"text":"Being best friends with the bartenders helps but my friends and I practically lived here for a long time.  We knew the whole staff, and have some great memories from this place.  The prices are great, and the food is incredible (for bar food)."}
{"text":"Love this place a little more each time I come. Once you get to know the bartenders it's hard to go anywhere else. The food is great (especially the guacamole). Can't beat this spot when you want to relax with good food, booze and people. ;)"}
{"text":"This place is great, every bartender is awesome and I always win here"}
{"text":"Cook shows up late, manager is always angry, and comps for gambling are inconsistent.    Used to be a regular spot for night shifters getting off in the morning... now its dead.    Treat your regulars well... it pays off in the end."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm giving this 4 stars even though I only wanted to give it 3 stars.  Here's why:  1.  Phil S. writes a nice review with no faults & still gives it only 3 stars.  WTF Phil?  \"Awesome\" nachos, bar & table seating, a jukebox - where's the loss of stars?  Location?  Get real.  You shouldn't deduct stars because you had to drive home drunk too far - that's your own damn fault.  2.  It is connected to and part of Que Mas Mexican Cafe next door, and Que Mas is the best casual Mexican sit-down restaurant I've found in North Las Vegas so far.  Yummy.  Read my review there unless Yelp takes my advice and lumps the two places together as they should.  3.  Service at the bar was good, but not great.  Bartender was hot, but she spent too much time with the \"regulars\" at the bar and ignored me & my girl (who is also hot) while jabbering with them.  Not cool, so they only deserve 3 stars.  At least the bar part does.  Hmmm - maybe they shouldn't lump the two places together after all.   In fact, the rather lackluster (it wasn't bad enough to be crappy or reprehensible) service at the bar might have been enough to warrant only two stars.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt due to the fact that the day shift bartender (did I mention she was hot?) was working swing shift this night, covering for the regular swing bar babe.  She was a little tired & out of her element, so probably not at her best.  She looked good though, so if you don't mind waving your hands or whistling across the bar to get her attention then you're all good.  Make sure to order a shot from a bottle on the bottom shelf while you're at it.  :-)  And get a margarita too - we tried them when we went back to the restaurant part a couple of weeks later & they were absolutely spectacular.  Didn't stop in the bar part to see if it was our ignore-the-newbies hottie who made them 'cause the GF was pretty \"anxious\" to get home after having a couple with dinner, so we split rather quick.  Check please!!!!"}
{"text":"Sizzling enchiladas are where it's at. Also the carnitas and shredded beef tacos are fat and juicy. Chips were nice and warm served with tasty salsa, not to hot. Friendly service and a full tummy. Glad I found this spot. Yum!"}
{"text":"Our experience started while looking for a parking spot. As we had the windows in our car rolled down we noticed the waitress grabbing something from her car. She turned around and yelled \"hello, how are you\". As we walked in the bar was packed and was a bit nervous we would not get attention since we decided to sit at a table. Immediately the waitress we seen outside holler \"hiiiii... I'll be right with you!\" In less than a minute our waitress April came and took our drink order. We liked the fact they had a full menu from the restaurant next door called Que Mas. We ordered Wings as an appetizer. The wings were perfectly cooked and peeled off the bone smoothing. One of the best wings I had in a while. Then we ordered the Vallarta enchiladas and the beef chimichanga. So fresh and great! this is coming from a food critic. April was attentive, quick and so personable. A good atmosphere. Defiantly a great experience. The only thing I would change is changing this to a Raider bar! :) Thank you! We will see you again soon!"}
{"text":"Tacos for $1 after 8!! They are soo good :) We live right near this bar, it is an awesome neighborhood grill, reminds me of the years I lived in Southern California! The tacos are so juicy, what do they do to those things that keep me coming back for more!   And the manager is awesome and from New Jersey like me so it's really fun to catch him in there late night and shoot the Jersey sh*t!  Great place :)"}
{"text":"The food is very good, always hot and tasty. The service could use work. The manager seems good and will work to get your order done for you. The bartenders the several times I have been there seem to be younger under 35 and just not so interested in being welcoming unless they know you. So I bring my own friends in that way you don't have to rely on them for any type of sincere verbal exchange. The place is easy to get into and centrally  located within NW Las Vegas but if you are expecting a \"Cheers\" type atmosphere  (Fa-getit) lol...One other good thing it appears to be a drug free zone which is kinda hard to find here."}
{"text":"I was actually looking for a pool table, nice music, and I didn't smell like smoke when I left....Found it!  I am so happy to have been introduced to this spot.  Try the guacamole/salsa and chips.  Was Great..   Nice friendly place to hang out with friends of all ages, with a nice mixed crowd.  The theme is of course Surf boards and stuff."}
{"text":"I would like to give this place zero stars for many reasons but it made me give it at least one.   We had just moved to the area and after a long day of unpacking we decided to go get some food and drinks and since this was one of the few places I had passed on the way to the new place we decided to try it out.  We got there and sat at one of the tables instead of the bar since we knew we were going to be ordering food.  Well i guess it was to much to ask for the bartender to acknowledge us let alone come to the table to take our order so my boyfriend went to the bar and placed our order for both the food and drinks.  There were 3 of us and we each ordered a meal and then an order of chips and salsa as an appetizer.   We never got the chips and salsa and I ordered a beef chimichanga and received chicken enchiladas (not even close to the same thing).  Not once did the bartender check on us, ask if we needed anything or even ask if we wanted another drink so we continued going up to the bar to get our drinks and finally to get our check.    I was dead set on never going back there but my boyfriend convinced me that maybe it was just a fluke and so we tried it again.  This time we knew to just sit at the bar if we wanted to get any service.  I had to use the restroom and when I came back the bartender still hadn't even said so much as a hi to my boyfriend and continued to have a conversation with another employee that must have just gotten off work.  We still sat there for a few minutes waiting and he still never even  turned around so we got up to leave and then he turned around and said \"oh can I get you guys something\".  We said no and walked out.  So if you feel like eating, getting what you ordered and actually being waited on I would suggest not going to this place."}
{"text":"food and drinks were awesome at this place...mostly locals due to it being off the strip"}
{"text":"The wife and I work quite different schedules. I manage a bank and am always home fairly early in the evening. My wife, however, is a general manager of a retail store and works many late nights. We often meet for drinks or a late night bite and are always looking to try out new bars and local hangouts that we simply had not had the chance to try out in our 12 years living in Vegas. A while back we came upon finally trying out Surf City bar located behind Arby's and the 99 Cent store on Martin Luther King & Craig.   The bar is connected to a very large Mexican restaurant called Que MÃ¡s I believe. We have never dined there as by the time we get there it is closed. The bar; however is 24/7 in typical local dive bar style, but Surf City is certainly not what I would consider to be a Dive Bar.   It is styled like a California beach city in the 50's and 60's, with surfboards, posters, and aesthetic adornments on the walls that remind you of Huntington Beach and Laguna.   They have one coin-op pool table that has very nicely maintained felt and firm bumpers. The coin-op mechanism works perfectly and even the house cues are quite straight and usable.   Every time we have gone there, we have had the pleasure of being served by Dean, the Bar Manager. Dean is the type of bar manager that you wished all bars had. Reminiscent of Sam Malone from Cheers for his humor, friendliness, and welcoming nature, I feel like Norm when I walk in, warmly greeted and asked if I would like my usual.   We have tried a few different versions of their nachos from the bar menu and all have been delicious and fresh. It is evident that the cooks are very familiar with the recipes as the nachos are ones that are certainly prepared with experience.   The game of pool will run you $0.75. Dean will sell you quarters if you didn't bring any. They don't have Midori, but I'm totally fine with it as the well melon liqueur is just as tasty and cheaper anyway!  The Surf City is a wonderful local hangout with solid value, tasty bar food, and a comfortable place to smoke and play some pool or some video poker. I look forward to probably going there again tonight!"}
{"text":"After patronizing this resteraunt frequently and have never had a problem on the resteraunt side but today was told we needed to be on the bar side for happy hour . No problem.  After sitting there for 10 minutes noone helped us and having to go get our original waitress to address this the waitress came over and was rude and nasty off the bat. Her demeanor was unacceptable and nasty. And was upset we actually couldn't sit at the bat where there was smoking because of my attitude. Lord forbid she had to actually walk and help someone who isnt sitting at the bar .It seemed as though she customer profiled us off the bat. Which is unacceptable. The manager April triied to make it better I guess but her telling us that doesnt matter hear nor there . It really did matter. And I honestly don't believe she will address it and that's fine she really doesnt have to at this point because I will nolonger patronize a business who will treat their guest like that. I'm in business and I won't accept this kind of service and spend my money at a place that we aren't treated with customer service attitude. Period.  No need for free drinks I'm more then capable of purchasing my own. Thanks but No Thanks."}
{"text":"awesome bar. Not just because they show my charger games, well, yes, because they love my chargers. great food.  great service. sandra keeps the drinks cold and the food hot! the football specials are great. pacificos for 3.75. hot wings, potato skins, and nachos. cant go wrong here. come on by . youll love it"}
{"text":"My brother, BFF, boyfriend and myself decided to check this bar out last night. It was big and bright with nice colorful decor. We wanted to play pool and to our surprise it was only 75 cents! That's hard to find in decent bars. So my brother and boyfriend sit at the bar while my BFF and I set up the pool table. My brother then walks up to me and says the bartender wants to see our IDs. So I took my BFF and my IDs over to the bar and this pathetic excuse of a bartender (blonde with fake chesticles) keeps walking pass me and kept talking to the other customers and paid no mind to us. Not once, but three times she walks pass. My brother extends both IDs so she can see it. Finally she comes up to us and asks what I would like to drink. I said nothing you wanted to see our IDs right? And she goes, \"Oh yeah.\" Takes a glimpse, and basically shoves it back. Rude, much? Her attitude was so horrid, my brother and boyfriend left the bar area so they didn't have to deal with her attitude. By the way blondie, if you're working for tips, next time, you should be nice to EVERYONE. Because our group was the richest people at the bar at the time and you didn't get a tip from us. You were totally barking up the wrong tree.  why one star? POOR SERVICE FROM BLONDIE!"}
{"text":"Good happy hour. Good food.  Not too smokey for a bar.  Gotta love Mexican food in large portions.   It's a San Diego Chargers spot. So all the better for my families team. Bring the football season and bring the cold beer. We are ready.   Only there twice, so far.  Yet with our food orders and what we saw to others served.  You won't get tired of the menu.  I saw locals there, which the bartender called by name.  I like spots where they know your name.  More personable."}
{"text":"The bartender was vey unpleasant. The bar was empty with only one other couple in the bar and she acted as if we were interrupting her. I asked the prices of there draft beer and I got an extremely rude response. Both of out orders came out missing part of the meal and I didn't notice until about halfway threw the meal and when I brought to our bartenders attention she rudely replied that I could have said something before I ate half of it.  The burrito was mostly beans with barley any meet."}
{"text":"This your local area 24/7 bar and grill, but it serves Mexican food. I love this place reasonable drink prices, great margaritas, and a friendly staff! I'm in here at least once a week for Brad, Jason, and Bridget, they are the best. They are why I show up! If you need Mexican food at any hour, this I the place in north las Vegas! Dollar tacos at night FTW! damn good tacos for a buck too."}
{"text":"Great place. We went their to have a drink before we went to the restaurant connected to it, Que Mas Mexican Cafe. We asked the bartender (Doug, I think) for a special brand of tequila, Don Julio Anejo, and he went to his magic closet, brought it out and we had a couple of shots. He was amazing, friendly and very attentive to all the patrons that were there. Now that football has started, you need to visit this place. Especially if your are a San Diego Charger fan."}
{"text":"Well, I notice there hasn't been  a review on this place in a while...but...sorry to say, not much appears to have changed.    The service is very subpar in that the bartenders ten to ignore the heck out of you if you don't sit there five days a week and play their bar slots. Actually, they spend a LOT of time talking to each other like they don't spend hours on hours together at work. It's actually kinda pathetic....Not to mention, one of the bartenders is a smoker and he's always chain smoking over on the side which I find rather rude. I don't think I've EVER been in an establishment where it was ok for employees to smoke WHILE working, but *shrug*...When they FINALLY do get to you, they are nice I guess but by then you already feel like crap from having been ignored for so long....  The food...comes from Que Mas (attached/same biz) and it's pretty good. My fave are the chicken wings (they're fried with some great hot sauce on the side) with the nachos coming in second.  Dollar tacos are a winner too.   The drinks are so-so. Nothing to write home about (hence, why I'm writing about them on Yelp lol) and you can get them ANYWHERE. No signature drink that I'm aware of and the happy hour prices cover only the basic beers/margaritas. Again, nothing you can't find at any bar.   The only major upside is that the place is never really super crowded that I've ever seen...but hey...that may have something to do with the service *shrug*"}
{"text":"The first bar I came to when I moved here. Yep. And I'm still going there 6 weeks later. The staff made me feel so welcomed. I know that's their job but this place and the staff are special. My neighbor recommended Surf City and I'm glad. It's a small place that embraces the surfing concept complete with a tiki house bar. Drinks are great! Get the braised beef taco or ceviche! The food comes from a Mexican restaurant next door and they share an inside door. I think every bar here has video game gambling, but I haven't been anywhere else but here. I'll continue to consider this my go-to bar. Go ahead and check out Surf City!"}
{"text":"We ate at the Que Mas restaurant inside the Surf City and had a Restaurants.com coupon. We ordered the fajitas...... one chicken and one steak. The food was good with large servings ...... atmosphere and service... were good. The margaritas and chip/salsa were fine as well. From what I've read of this place, the bar is not the place to eat. I'll be back with another coupon; trying different dishes and writing additional comments.    Updated:   02/10/2013. We entered at the Que Mas entrance and were seated promptly. We ordered 2 house margaritas. They were good. Manny, our server, did a great job. Nice chips and salsa. My girlfriend ordered fish tacos and I ordered the Supreme Fajitas. My girlfriend stated that the fish tacos were some of the best she's had in a very long time and she's from Florida. My fajitas were tastey..... the shrimp was cooked  well.... very flavorful. The serving size was very nice..... I got a to-go box and had some left-over fajitas for breakfast. I like this place.... kinda cozy, not too dark, not noisey and the service was good. They take coupons from Restaurant.com. I will be back again."}
{"text":"Came in for my weekly chicken wing fix, I hardly ever gamble but decided to put $20 in machine, I was just a few hands in when I hit a royal Flush!!!! Very happy to say the least. The bartenders, drinks & food are always excellent but tonight was exceptional. Will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok place to drink during the day, very good bar menu. But I found that some of the swing shift  bartenders (guys) have an I don't care attitude.  I still go there some what regularly but try to stick to day shift."}
{"text":"Saturday night was my first time here and I was accompanied by my brother & my fiance,... the first few minutes were okay. But right away I did not get a good vibe from the blonde bartender. We mainly asked for beer so we didn't give her a hard time. By the end of the night she gave us the nastiest attitude ever while we were signing the receipts because she wanted a tip so badly that she basically forced it upon us while asking for it by practically telling at us. I understand it's nice to tip but sometimes people dont have extra money to be giving away. Sometimes we walk in with a limit of what we can spend. We tip everywhere we go except this one time we couldn't tip as much as we usually do. It was the worst experience when she yelled at us in front of her coworker & everyone else in there. I was so disgusted I gave her $3 so she can stop complaining...we went to sit back down & from all the way across the bar I heard her complaining about her tip. She literally killed everyone's vibe & we had to get out of there asap because of her nasty attitude. The attitude even continued after she complained. We were getting disgusted & uncomfortable so we needed to leave. We will never be going to this place ever again and I will let my friends & family members know so they never come across this female bartender. Worst experience. I would give it 0 stars if there was an option."}
{"text":"Bar and grille with surfer decor. I visited this bar once as one of a few bars during a night of barhopping and It was a nice locals place. I had the nachos which were big and awesome, but there are other menu items available. The food comes from the kitchen next door which is a Mexican restaurant of which the name slips my mind right now. This place has bar and table seating, tables are made out of surfboards. There is also a touch screen juke box for all your music needs. A little far in North Las Vegas and I live in North Las Vegas, but closer to Downtown. Check it out if you are ever in the area."}
{"text":"Finally got around to checking this spot out after living three miles away for over a decade.   I was pleasantly surprised and will be sure to return.   The bar looks like it was picked up from a beach city and transplanted into North Las Vegas- it's super cute with tiki hut/surf board decor, very clean and well maintained.   There are tables made of surf boards, brightly colored furnishings and whimsical decorations suspended from the ceiling- a nice change from the myriad of shady taverns in the city.   The tap selection is surprisingly diverse, featuring staples like Sam Adams and Blue Moon but also Hoffbrauhaus.   The property is connected to a Mexican restaurant next door. While the restaurant closes at 10, there is a limited food menu available all night at the bar. Will be sure to try it next time.   They have a clean and well maintained coin operated pool table, which was my main draw tonight.   Bartender was very friendly and chatty, all in all place has a really friendly vibe, I'm sure to add them to my list of \"go to\" spots."}
