{"text":"This restaurant has to be one of the worse places I've ever experienced.  If not for my two exceptionally hungry boys I would have gotten up and left many times over.   Issues:  1.  Reservation: we were not seated for almost 40 minutes past our reservation time.  2:  Service:  nonexistent.  There were not enough servers.  We repeatedly had to wave one down for drinks and it took several attempts to get water and tea.  3. Dirty grill: The chef didn't clean the grill before cooking. I could see leftover food from the last service and bits of wrapping paper from straws on the grill while he was cooking. Yuck! 4. Contaminated spatula: the chef served the fried rice with the same spatula he just used to cook raw chicken.  5 No sauce:  We were not given any dipping sauce. When we asked the chef he told us to ask a server. And, of course, there were no servers to be found.  6. Mixed up orders:  there were others at the table who didn't get the meal they ordered because the chef plated them on the wrong person's plate.   I hope this place is helpful to those who are considering this place."}
{"text":"Not the fanciest restaurant but food is fairly good with plenty of seating for larger groups. I ordered a deluxe teppanyaki which comes with a salad, miso soup, meats of your choice, steamed rice, and 1 scoop ice cream. All of this for about $23 without tax. Flavours were good but I did find it greasy. If you are super picky about food contamination/cleanliness, I would avoid this place as the chef uses the same spatula for raw meat as he does for everything else including fried rice and veggies. That being said, it was a great show: he entertained us by setting the grill on fire and doing tricks with the cooking utensils! If I return, I will try their sushi and sashimi next time as they had a lot of variety on the Japanese menu. Plenty of parking around this restaurant located at corner of Tomken and Eglinton.   Gave 3 stars because overall it was a lot of food (and decently delicious too) for the price, with fine service. Gave it 2 stars less because it wasn't the most sanitary or nicely decorated restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good tapanyaki table, pretty decent japanese chef, well i'd say the best one in mississauga/oakville. One thing about this place, it's quite popular and if you go there especially with tapanyaki in mind, do make sure you have a reservation, otherwise they'll turn you down. it looks so small from the outside, and once you step in you realize that it's a pretty decent japanese place run by the chinese people. offcourse they have Chinese, Japanese and Korean all sorts of foods. Scarboro/Markham has lots of good asian places, especially \"A taste of japan\" for tapanyaki. yum yummmmmmmm"}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place. The waitress gives us salad and soup but no fork or spoon, don't understand why we have to ask for it. The sushi I ordered their rice was very under cooked. I stopped by a fast food spot after this because the food was not satisfying."}
{"text":"*** to bad you can't give a restaurant 3.5 ***   Went to the Iron Chef (love the name & the show) with a group of friends to just chill, chat and have a good time.  Iron Chef has two kinds of dinning - one is the restaurant and the other is on the teppanyaki table.    The iron chef has many trained chefs that do a lot of cool tricks on the teppanyaki table - if you have been to other teppanyaki style restaurants than you know what I am talking about - most of the tricks are fairly standard, flipping and spinning knives, setting things on fire and throwing food into people's mouths!  Though I think what makes the whole experience exciting is the actual chef ..  the chef who cooked for us was witty, funny and very chatty.  Not sure what his name is, but when you walk into the restaurant his picture is on the pull up banner...  getting back to the food, the food is your typical Japanese food with fish, chicken, pork, beef, shrimp, - most meals come with soup, salad, and your choice of rice (steamed / fried) - i went with the steamed but after watching him make the fried rice .. i wish i had chosen the fried rice lol ..   **one thing to note - is that this place has very few veggie options (it is a steak house) ...   Other than that the place was not bad, the service from the waiters was a little slow - but i;ll let it pass :P  Also, we tried the appetizers - they were \"okay\" - the dumplings weren't good and a little over done, and the sushi was okay .. not their specialty i guess  overall i recommend this place if you have a big group and want a little entertainment too!"}
{"text":"I used to prefer Prince Sushi on Eglington for their Teppanyaki but after recent repeated visits of both places I now deem this place as the best Teppanyaki in town. Chefs and wait staff are all very friendly. They don't rush to put all the food in front of you at once. More importantly their chefs know how to cook.  They do attempt to show their enthusiasm at the table but unfortunately you can tell they got worn out having to do this to hundreds of people every week. Still good enough to entertain my little ones though as they love watching the volcano trick (setting stacked onions on fire). No disappointment from the sushi bar either as the fish they use is pretty fresh and properly prepared. The decor they have did not give me a complete Japanese feel but the atmosphere of the restaurant is great. I left without a greasy smell from their Teppanyaki table every time which was important for me because I like to go back."}
{"text":"We went for the teppenyaki dinner - good food - not spectacular but definitely enjoyable , good service, friendly staff and the best part was of course the performance by the chef. I enjoyed it so much it felt too short and left me wanting more !!!  Amazing to see the food being cooked so fresh right in front of your eyes and served piping hot onto the plate ! Great experience and would definitely come back again, more so for the tricks than the food !"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Probably one of the best restaurants I've been to in a long while. The servers were super nice and considerate. Loads of smiles and great food. Definitely a place I'd recommend. The cook was really fun to watch and he made fun jokes while cooking, it was such a unique experience!"}
{"text":"The food was ok. Service was really good but I just wasn't impressed with the food itself. The portions are a good size but smaller than their competitors. Prices are in-line with their competitors. I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night in July. Place was empty but it was only 6:00pm. Seated promptly. Ordered drinks (Sapporro was $10 a can!). Tried the sushi/sashimi platter to start. Very fresh. Nice presentation. Teppenyaki for the main course. Our chef worked wonders with the grill but wasn't as active as others. High Lite was the fireman. Sirloin was tasty and tender. Shrimp were perfectly prepared. Salmon was a hearty piece and scallops were plentiful. Salad, miso soup, steamed rice and mixed veg on the grill rounded out the meal. Finished it off with a green tea ice cream. Fun had by all. Walked away satisfied but bill was almost $200 for four with only one beer and a small hot saki from the bar."}
{"text":"Big fan.  Nice little restaurant that is always busy at lunch when I go with co-workers  Good prices, and great lunch specials. I'm a vegetarian so I've always enjoyed the veggie type rolls and have always been fresh. However one time I went at lunch one of my co-workers did say that he could tell one of the more popular rolls had been pre-made and had clearly been out for awhile as it was not as fresh as the other food. With that being said I'm not surprised they may pre-make some of their rolls before the lunch crowd, and other than that one experience, it's always been very good"}
{"text":"I have to agree with Madelaine here. Very generic Chinese American food, I could probably try cook it at home.. I could probably try flip the knives and choppers at home too but it's not a good idea. I expected more as far as the food is concerned ... I doubt I will be going there again."}
{"text":"I ordered for a party tray one night for delivery and what a disappointment!  Price was ok but the worst part was he sashimis looked discolored and they tasted old.  How can you expect people to come back to you if this is what you're going to serve them...garbage!!!  I was very pissed and I swear never to order or eat from them again.  I really just want to give them no stars but I think one star is the minimum."}
{"text":"My favorite Japanese restaurant in town, convenient location off the highway. Can never get bored of their Hiroshima roll or their awesome cherry blossom mushroom appetizer. Got to try their deep fried cheese cake!!"}
{"text":"Food, service and atmosphere was beautiful. It's a different kind of dining experience.  A \"must do\" if you haven't already. The sushi was fantastic."}
{"text":"Really like this place!  Great healthy food!  I seem to always order the teriaki chicken or beef, but last night I tried the salmon.  The chicken and beef are always great and the salmon was really good!  The salmon like the chicken and beef were grilled.  The salmon might have been cooked just a minute or so too long but it was still really good.  This dinner comes with rice, salad and a bunch of sauted vegetables like mushrooms, carrots, and squash.  They use a mild amount of teriyaki sauce on the dinner itself which is the way I like it but if you like extra sauce be sure to ask.  I also always get their edemame which is a good amount and is lightly salted.  Takes about 10 to 15 minutes to get your to-go food.  I would definitely recommend. Great food, really nice atmosphere and the staff is always nice and polite."}
{"text":"Came here recently with a group of 6.  We had the teppanyaki. If you have never experienced this type of dining before, you might find it more entertaining.  But comparing the others that I have been to, the performance is amateur and doesn't represent a true teppanyaki dining experience.  The food is decent, nothing fancy.  Don't expect too much from the service.  It's operated by Chinese not Japanese.  It's the only one in Mississauga. So if you want to try something different, not bad to try it."}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery only because my mom was coming home from a long flight and I wanted a nice variety of food ready for her to eat. So this place came to mind and to try somewhere new for me.  So I ordered 13 different items so hopefully this give you some insight into their food.  Appetizers:  Garden Salad w/house dressing - Its a basic everyday green salad. It was good and fresh. I personally didn't like the dressing only because it was heavily creamy and I like more vinegar based dressings.  Yam Tempura - This was disappointing 3/10, we received 4 pieces that were not cooked properly. 3/4 were very under cooked.  Tempura Mix - 7/10 - The shrimp were cooked well but again the vegetables were under cooked.  Cherry Blossom Mushrooms - 10/10 - OMG these were amazing!!! so big and so flavorful!!! I high recommend these no matter what. If your allergic to mushrooms I feel bad for you.   Yakitori Moriawase - 5/10 - These weren't really great, I was expecting more flavour, mind you they were cooked well, just lacking in taste.  Chicken Katsu - 8/10 - Very well cooked, good crispiness and good size. Could use a little more flavour.  Beef Kushiyaki - Skewered beef with teriyaki sauce. 7/10 - Well cooked and flavourful, but small size for the money.  Entrees: Shrimp Fried Rice - This we gave 10/10, it was great, not oily or dried out like some places. I love when restaurants add egg, it makes to so much better. As well it had a good balance of shrimp/rice/veggie ratio so every bite had something.  Salmon Teriyaki Bento Box - This was one of my favorites 10/10. Great portion size and a lot of flavour. The Salmon was well cooked and the mix of mushrooms and Zucchini was really good. Highly recommended.  Grilled Shrimp Bento - The shrimp and vegetables were cooked perfectly. great portion, only thing is the shrimp even though it was tossed in butter sauce need more spice. other than that great meal.   Hope you enjoyed the review and helps you pick your meal.  xoxo happy eats."}
{"text":"First off, I have never tried their teppanyaki or dinner because I have heard mixed reviews.  HOWEVER, I have tried their lunch specials. Delicious and worth it. It is usually quite busy because it is near a business-populated area.   I consider going here whenever I feel like a \"cooked\" Japanese meal. I rarely come here for the sushi/sashimi itself. It's the teriyakis and cooked bento boxes that got me coming back for lunch. I love the way they stir-fry (or should I say teppanyaki stir-fry) their vegetables.  Portion of meat + side of vegetables + rice = a solid tasty $10-15 lunch entree."}
{"text":"It's tricky coming here in the winter.  When they seated us the windows were wide open and therefore it was extremely cold.  However, the minute the ignite the cooking surface, it gets very warm.  It turns out the seats by the window are the preferred spots.  Simple menu - choose your meat, seafood and/or the vegetarian option.  As you enjoy your miso soup and japanese salad, sit back and be entertained by the cook.  They are trained to perform tricks for you and tell jokes at the same time.  Talk about multi-tasking!    It's great having your food served directly from the grill.  Fried rice and vegetables are also served with your meat.  It didn't seem like that much food as it arrived in waves, but I was stuffed by the end of the meal.  Oh ya, they include ice cream too - and they have some of my favourite flavours (green tea and mango)."}
{"text":"I tried to think of one good thing at this restaurant but the overall experience was sub par.  First of all, my friend and I came looking for teppanyaki. I'm pretty sure that this is the location of the restaurant but what do you know... No teppanyaki. At least not that we saw. It was hidden. It was my fault for not asking I guess.  Then, we walk in and no one really greets us. It's not like it was busy either.   We sit down in a booth and order, and we get served salad and soup. No silverware. When I ask for them? He looks at me and ASKS if we want spoons and forks. Really?   As I'm eating my food, the rice in my sushi is undercooked.   For the price, I guess food was fairly reasonably portioned but I can't say that I can recommend this place.   I can overlook one or two downfalls but too many mistakes. Especially when the waiter can't even remember who ordered what and mixes up orders."}
{"text":"My friend who came back to Canada for Christmas had never tried teppanyaki, so we decided to come to Iron Chef and give it a try. My two friends ordered a beef teriyaki teppanyaki entree, while I got a salmon teriyaki teppanyaki entree. My friend also ordered agedashi gyoza to start - I can't comment on the taste as I didn't have any, but they looked very crispy!  The lunch entrees claimed to come with miso soup, salad, protein, mixed vegetables, choice of steamed rice or fried rice (for an additional charge), and dessert.  All your orders are cooked with generous portions of oil and garlic butter (with parsley, the chef emphasized).  The chef was very friendly and funny. He threw mushrooms at us, joked about giving us haircuts with the sharp knife, scooped random things on our plates (I got a handful of sesame seeds while my friend got a slab of cold butter). He did the onion volcano without us even asking (my friend was so amused and excited, since it was his first time) and was also very accommodating. I had asked for the teriyaki sauce on the side, and he did so while joking that it'd cost an extra $2.  He kept exclaiming about how the salmon tasted good while squirting a generous portion of lemon juice and slathering it with butter. He then also gave me a free helping of beef teriyaki, claiming that I must try the delicious beef.  Overall, a very entertaining experience. However, the service was slow and lacking - I had to keep asking for refills and calling them over. Also, I was slightly upset that the menu stated there would be ice cream, but none was given at the end. :("}
{"text":"This was not my kind of dining experience at all (though one of the girls in the party said it was her favourite restaurant in the GTA but she's a self proclaimed picky eater, so we have quite different tastes in restaurants.)  Here's my assessment:   The food was good, but pretty generic which it has to be, since they're serving the exact same thing (except for slight meat variations) to every single person.  It probably would've been better with a larger or smaller group - 4 would've been perfect sitting around the corner, but with 6 people it was a bit awkward.  Our meal felt rushed - I couldn't believe we had salad, soup, main course, dessert, and wine in about an hour.   The flare wasn't too special - it was good at first, but since the whole thing went pretty quickly, there wasn't much time for much else.  If others wanted to go back, I wouldn't oppose... but I wouldn't choose to go back on my own or bring others - we (my boyfriend and I) usually have much nicer and longer evenings for a $75 bill.   ***Tip: Order your wine by the glass - it's the best value.  We went with the half liter and only managed 2 and a bit glasses for $15. For $5.50 you get a glass filled to the top. You do the math. :-)***"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on Mother's day. It took a combo of 3 people to lead us in, 3 people to get our food order and 3 people to make things right. What the heck!?! Also, I couldn't get a single conversation going on with my hubby without being disturbed. Very very annoying!  Final words, THE WORST Japanese Teppanyaki Restaurant EVER!!! Expensive with the food quality is worse than food court's. The food's flavour is no where close to Japan. Save your money and go elsewhere.  P.S: The place is Chinese own and do not let the picture fool you."}
{"text":"Waitress who took our order was rude. We decided to go with the teppanyaki. I got food poisoning from the beef teriyaki! The chef was funny and put on a good show. I have to give one star because of the food poisoning!!!"}
{"text":"Our server was great. We ordered off the standard menu where sushi was tasty and fresh.  The special sauce for the lobster roll tasted as though it was mayo and thousand island dressing.  The pad Thai was udon noodle and what we think was bottle sweet and spicy Thai sauce - not at all impressive.  Suporro can was $10.50 each."}
{"text":"I only went for teppanyaki, will have to return to try out their sushi. Saturday night requires a reservation, and if you don't like a show with your food then this really isn't the place (or cuisine for that matter) for you. I wasn't expecting much since there were a number of larger parties there for special occasions, meaning experience weighed more than taste.  The menu is simple, and you can get sushi at the teppanyaki bar as well. The teppanyaki menu is set up as a meat/veggie plus sides set, so miso soup, rice, veggies, and ice cream accompany every choice. The combos will give you two or more choices of meat and fried rice upgrade en lieu of steamed rice. If you're there with a few more people and have no dietary restrictions I recommend getting the entrée sets and requesting the chef to share the main among your party. I went with teriyaki beef, and shared that alongside sirloin, salmon, and scallops.  The chef will put on a bit of a show tossing his tools around, applause applause. Then he will start cooking after lighting some oil and sake on fire, and presenting the classic onion ring volcano. Depending on your chef things will be served in differing order, but very close to each other and the veggies will be done soon to keep you chewing as you enjoy the rest of the show. If anybody ordered fried rice on your side, you get a few extra egg tricks!  The food is all one flavour really, the same spices are thrown on everything. Meats are either garlic butter or teriyaki sauce, but I couldn't really differentiate. The scallops were great and the sirloin was indeed medium rare, but the salmon was over cooked and the teriyaki beef was dry. The veggies are on the salty side, and the bean sprouts are simple. The steamed rice is indeed a bit boring, but the fried rice really didn't feel like it was worth the extra dollars.  Overall I was satisfied with my meal, but it's definitely only an occasional visit for teppanyaki as it wasn't really amazingly delicious and didn't offer much variety. I'll be back to try the sushi, looking forward to less rowdiness that comes along with the teppanyaki show."}
{"text":"Ordered a simple deluxe sashimi lunch for delivery, placed the order in and waited a full hour. Lady on the phone told me to look up how far my house was from the restaurant when I gave them my address. Delivery fee is $5 and it's definitely not worth it. They also charged me $24.60 when the menu said $21.00, plus tax was $33 + tip. Unbelievable. Restaurant dine in service AS WELL as delivery service should both be a priority especially if you make delivery an option for customers. Overall, never got no call back explaining about any issues with delivery, I had to call them. NEVER call for delivery from this place."}
{"text":"Have been here many times in te past and was always happy. Howver went there today with party of six. They were severly disorganized and forgot to prepare two of our entrees. There was no apology and they were not even busy. The entrees that came out were hastily prepared. I will never complain about the quality of their food. However the customer service is non-existant. Will never return"}
{"text":"Its like dinner and a show.  They cook in front of you so you see the talent these people have.  The food is certainly fresh, well prepared and tasty.  Unfortunately we were only here for appetisers as we had another engagement to keep, but I cant wait to come back and sample more items.  This place rocks, but my little taste of what they have to offer wasn't enough.  Saki, Yakitori and spring rolls, what a divine combination.  However if we had more time I think i need to try the Kalbee, the teriyaki salmon and the shrimp with garlic butter.  They seem to have a lot of interesting items just waiting for my next visit."}
{"text":"First time at Japanese teppanyaki, so I was very excited!  Our group was seated fairly quickly and our orders were taken promptly. It did take the chef to come out and prep our meals, but he was very interactive and made it fun. I was kind of surprised to see how short the whole thing was... maybe 15 mins? Which makes sense I guess.   The quality of the food was good, given everything is freshly cooked right in front of you. Although not a great bang for your buck, it's a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"fun atmosphere, chefs were engaging. we went with a large group including kids and everyone had a blast. servers were busy but cheerful. we will return."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Iron Chef with my family Sunday night, and I cannot recommend it more highly. The restaurant is split into two sides - one side serves a traditional menu, and the other side serves a teppanyaki dinner. We had teppanyaki but ordered an assortment of sushi & sashimi to try as well. The fish was incredibly fresh and prepared to perfection.  As for the teppanyaki, our Chef, Tony, was professional and friendly. He started with a fun demonstration that involved flipping his cooking instruments and then created an onion volcano for our entertainment. My mom and I ordered the sirloin & shrimp, and my dad ordered the scallops & shrimp, and everything was delicious. In addition to the meat/seafood options, the teppanyaki comes with rice and veggies for a full meal. We were beyond stuffed and took some leftovers home with us as well.  We experienced fantastic service the entire time we were there, from the door staff to the wait staff to the sushi chef. The staff were respectful, professional, attentive, and friendly.   The space would be great for a larger party, such as for a birthday, engagement, or company event. And the location is conveniently close to the airport and right off the highway. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in the Toronto area."}
{"text":"Came for Christmas dinner with my girlfriend and her family.. Made a reservation for 7, arrived at 6:30 and ordering was still extremely late. (Over an hour) Didn't help that it was colder inside the restaurant then outside in the middle of winter. No heaters provided. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Food is great. and for the cost, it's not bad.   I've come here a few times for the lunch specials. At around $10-13 you can get two types of rolls, a bento box, all with salad and miso soup.   Today we came here for the grill area, but I wasn't impressed at all with the service.  We started at 12pm, and went til 2pm. Sitting in the corner it was hard to get the attention of servers.  When why did finally come to us it was at least 20 mins after we sat down.  Or order took another 20-25 mins. What I don't understand is that none of this stuff is cooked and will get cooked at the table in front of me.   It could be because the 2 chefs were pre-occupied with other tables, but they were done for at least 15 mins before one finally showed up to our table.  He did his tricks, but not as many as the guy next to us. A volcano of steam made out of onion rings. A 'japanese egg roll' where he rolled an egg on the table (no one really got that).  This is no benihana, and the price point reflects that.   I got a $12 scallop dish that comes with veggies, salad and soup and steamed rice but i asked for beef fried fried rice for an extra $3.50. it was worth it.   My tea was never refilled until we asked, and my co worker commented on the tea pot and he spent 5 mins explaining to us how awesome and flawed it was.   The servers are nice, but it took way too long. A wed. lunch should only take an hour."}
{"text":"Our team had Christmas lunch here today. The restaurant is split into two dining experiences - They have an order off menu section, and a teppanyaki section. We sat at the grill and filled one cooking grill (there are four grill tables). I would say 40 people can fit in this area.   The servers take your drink order, bring you salad and miso soup. The chef comes shortly after to start cooking. As we were a large group (and the boss was paying the tab) we also got sushi and sashimi as appetizers. We had two at our table who disliked fish, the chef will respectfully cook the seafood items last for no cross contamination which I thought was good enough to shut them up lol I ordered their steak chicken & shrimp. This choice was $28.50.  There are many options with and without seafood. The chef was entertaining and funny! He made the onion volcano which I always find really neat!! On the grill he cooked veggies (zucchini, onions, peppers & mushrooms) bean sprouts, fried rice and then your choice of meat and finally the seafood. Your steak is cooked to your liking (rare-well done). Everything was cooked well with a sassy chef doing his tricks throughout cooking. Very well seasoned and piping hot to boot, not over salted either which I liked! The knife the chef uses was impressive! I need one in my life!!!   This was a great experience which was entertaining and value was exceptional for the portions served! Will definitely go back again! Great show!"}
{"text":"Alright, to be fair, this place probably warrants 3 stars but I have to give it 1.   Let's recap the evening...  Great location, you can easily spot it from Eglinton and Tomken with their giant sized sign. Parking is a bit tight but there are plenty of it if you are willing to walk...  They have 2 sections of the restaurant, one with regular tables and then the cooking or \"Teppanyaki\" tables where there's a U shape around a flat steel grill.   The orders were taken pretty quickly (and as many reviews have stated, you are very much rushed along). We got our beverages and starters... I had the chicken yakitori. It was good. Grilled nicely and it wasn't heavily sauced, which I appreciated.  For the entree, I had the scallops with fried rice. The entree comes with salad, miso soup (which was quite good but again very standard) along with veggies. The fried rice does cost extra, otherwise you would get plain steamed rice.  The volcano onions was pretty neat but our chef was not the greatest... His egg roll and balancing egg tricks were sorely lacking and quite frankly, he dropped the egg in this first try then abandoned the show for the second egg all together...  So, why the 1 star Li... WHY? Well, I think it has to do with hygiene. Before the chef started and slightly at the beginning of his song and dance, he was on his phone and didn't wash his hands after. The food is placed on plastic trays (the one you find in food courts) and then dumped on the grill...   Finally, I leave with this... I now have the cleanest colon on this side of the world. I know, TMI but you've been warned."}
{"text":"If you`ve never gone to a teppanyaki... you should try it! Iron Chef, food is good, pricing is reasonable, for the experience; The chefs have their show on point; with onion volcanoes erupting, food throwing , and even juggling food; all while cooking your meal for you!"}
{"text":"We came here with a group from work and we sat at one of the cooking tables (Teppan). Hibachi is always a fun experience for me, and I definitely enjoyed my meal here.  I had the Sirloin steak and the vegetable fried rice. They cooked the rice first and I liked it a lot. Then they cooked the steak and I thought it was perfectly cooked and went very well with the rice and side of vegetables. Everything tasted great and I left nothing on my plate!  The staff was very nice. The chef was entertaining and did the usual tricks while cooking."}
{"text":"Had a teppanyaki dinner with a good friend as a late birthday celebration.  We made a reservation online for 6:30 p.m. which was confirmed via e-mail but when we arrived, they didn't seat us at that time - it seems like we had to wait for other guests to arrive to fill up a table, so we were seated just before 7 p.m. The food was plentiful and tasty but not unlike any other teppanyaki dinner I have had elsewhere. That's not a bad thing, it's just not any different or unique. Lots of offerings of appetizers, sushi, etc. The cost for teppanyaki was good but the sushi seemed to be high in price when added to the teppanyaki dinner."}
{"text":"This review can be summarized in five words: You pay for the experience.   I recently took my family here for a small celebration. We had a reservation in the teppanyaki cooking station side of the restaurant. They also offer a standard sit-down experience as well.  The menu for the cooking table is very simple - choose your protein and everything else is standard. They have a wide range of choices including chicken, beef, salmon, shrimp, scallops, and filet mignon, which vary in price from $16-26. With this price, you also get miso soup, garden salad, rice, vegetables, and ice cream.   We also ordered some appetizers as well - soft shell crab, the sashimi platter, and the house seafood spring rolls. The sashimi was the star here, as it was noticeably fresh.   While we ate our appetizers, the chef came by with our raw entrées. He entertained us by performing a variety of tricks with knives before finally firing up the grill with a spectacular onion volcano. He continued to do tricks throughout cooking our food, including cracking an egg with a knife in midair.   Once cooked, he left us to enjoy our entrées, which were good, but not great. It really wasn't anything you couldn't make at home. I had the scallop dish, but found the beef to be the best. In terms of portions, you receive a lot of food, even though you may not notice it because it's served in phases. By the end of it, we were all full.   It's not a place that you would visit often, but is great to visit once in a while for the experience. The sushi isn't bad, either.   Tip: I've heard that Iron Chef has great lunch specials between 11-3pm on weekdays. Check it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"All the other reviews talk write about the steakhouse side; but I always go to the sushi side ( never a wait though) ans service good too. I always get the Sushi combo special ; they have 18 different one; my favourite is the Hiroshima roll combo; shrimp tempura; spicy tuna, avocado and then topped with Tuna again. All the combo comes with soup, salad and 6 pieces of sushi ( yes in addition to the 8 pc roll); getting hungry thinking about it; So why here -simply it's fresh every time = others in area are not as fresh or tasty -- here it is consistently good"}
{"text":"Went there for sushi tonight so I can't comment on the Tappan.  The decor was crisp and modern. The dining room was clean and spacious. The prices on the menu seemed fair.   My friend and I each ordered one of the sushi combos and were both very pleased. The presentation of the meal was lovely and we found the taste to be quite good. The staff were all warm and welcoming. Overall we were both very satisfied and plan to go back again."}
{"text":"We liked this place the food that is, but the service... :(  They have some great options for vegans or vegetarians which is awesome but we went without friends and their children and they forgot one of the kids dishes and they gave him hardly any veggies compared to the rest of the kids. They also ran out of bean sprouts but didn't notify us. We had to ask why we didn't receive any.   Our \"chef\" at the cooking table seemed to not be really in the mood to cook for us. The other chefs did all kinds of cool tricks for the kids and such but ours didn't do any of those things and the kids were super disappointed. We told management but they didn't seem to be too concerned.   The food was tasty but there are lots of other tappionaky places in Mississauga that I personally think are better over all."}
{"text":"I' giving my review 3 1/2 stars. This is my second time coming to Iron Chef, and the experience was mixed. I came here with my in laws for a birthday, making a reservation the person on the phone was very disinterested sounding, just saying ya ya to the info given. Once arriving, we were taking to our room, which is the cold room that was mentioned in previous reviews. The manager apologized and explained that the hearing and a/c was malfunctioning and because of the holidays they had to wait for a repair person. To compensate they had several space heaters.  I appreciated the explanation, but there was another room that had space and it would have been nice to have the chance to move to the warmer room, but we were told no, it was reserved (we never saw anyone there  during our entire meal). The food was good, and the chef, Nova, put on a good show. My husband's steak was cooked to medium as requested, and my salmon and shrimp were well cooked without being rubbery.  They loose points bc of telephone service and they could have offered something to pacify customers who were in the cold room. Perhaps an appetizer to compensate"}
{"text":"As we enter a very small establishment, we are seated to the left in the restaurant to wait for a table. Which is okay, it's Mother's Day and I can understand it being incredibly busy.  We wait about 10 minutes and then we're shown to our table... there's a dirty napkin to my left side, I flick it away with the chopstick. Absolutely disgusting. The male server doesn't smile and doesn't give me half the menu. Quite alright it's Mother's Day and I can understand that the 50 menus he has in his hand is in short supply in a restaurant with about 20 patrons... I look at my fiance's drink menu to order my drinks.  A female waitress approaches the table to take the drink order, she does not smile nor welcome us. Quite alright, it's Mother's Day and I'm sure you're tired. She walks away in the middle of taking my drink order... I've been in your restaurant for 25 minutes and if I was not there for a Mother's Day celebration I would have walked out.  I am served a sad-looking salad, that is fairly common in these establishments... The lettuce is rotting, I pick through it and eat a few pieces and the piece of cucumber. I slide the remaining bowl to my right. The Miso soup is placed in front of me, I don't touch it. My fiance is kind enough to eat it for me, as I try not to waste food. The drinks arrived and it's the wrong order. She's forgotten one of the non-alcoholic drinks , and no water... It's been 40 minutes and you couldn't even get my drink order correct... Maybe if you had listened to the order, and not walked away in the middle of taking my order you would have heard me. The only saving grace of this establishment is the chef (He's brown, which was great to see some diversity). I focus on that through out the meal. His ability to interact with the two-year-old at our table is exceptional, his display work is amazing, the entire show is engaging and fun. The food tastes good. He is the ONLY reason you got three stars, because his welcoming smile, his general pleasant demeanor is the only thing that made this experience worth it. He should look for employment at Benihana, because he's that good and his ability to interact with his customers and make them feel welcomed is impressive, his ability to interact with children is impeccable. He was even aware and well mannered enough to wish the ladies at our table celebrating Mother's Day a Happy Mother's Day. Something not one of your servers nor your Hostess even acknowledged. He truly was your only saving grace during this meal. We order water once more, it arrives 10 minutes after... as he's eating the last of his meal.  There's a lot of room for improvement with the servers. They are the very face of your establishment and they are incredibly disassociated and have a general air of unpleasantness. If you can't even give me a menu, if you can't even listen to my order... then you might as well just have iPads.  Ambiance - 3/5 Cleanliness - 2/5 Entertainment - 5/5 Chef - 5/5 Servers/Waiters- 1/5 - You will get stuff brought to you EVENTUALLY. Lol  Overall verdict - Drinks are overpriced and quite mediocre, but the entertainment and food makes it well worth it. It's quite inexpensive as well. Honestly, focus on the entertainment, because the others aspects of the experience are barely worth noting."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch spot for sushi. The lunch specials are great value and change daily.   I always try something new when I visit and have NOT been disappointed yet.   Sashimi, sushi, teriyaki, hand rolls, tempura - all good here!  Must try!"}
{"text":"Totally decent food here.  If you expect to sit at the teppanyaki, you needed to have made a reservation.  Otherwise, fugghedaboutit.  So we sat at a booth, enjoyed our dinner and went on our merry way.  If I happen to be in the area again, I would make sure to call in advance otherwise, I think next time, I would order their sushi :-)"}
{"text":"I ended up stopping at the Iron Chef Restaurant on Sunday because of it's close location to the Battle Arts Academy. This was my first trip here and I left with kind of mixed feelings. The place itself is very large and offers plenty of seating with a friendly wait staff to help you out. The menu was typical for the type of place it is offering tons of hibachi, sushi, and basic asian fusion. Since the sushi menu didn't have what I was in the mood for I decided to just order the chicken teriyaki which offered miso soup, salad, and ice cream with it (or so it said). I was served the soup and salad right away and both were really good. The soup was very hot (the way it should be) and the salad was made very well. The meal itself was just okay. The rice was hot and fresh but the chicken was barely even warm, which isn't really how chicken should be served. The meal itself filled me up and served it's purpose although some warmer chicken would have been much more enjoyable. Finally the bill was dropped on the table and the ice cream was not offered, which if you know me will always be a huge disappointment. Overall, It wasn't necessarily a terrible overall experience but it wasn't a good enough one to make me want to return."}
{"text":"I was actually pleasantly surprised with my experience here.  I came for a birthday and there was 18 of us.  The birthday girl opted to do the teppanyaki menu, so we were all evenly spread out across two grills in the same room.  I think 18 was a perfect size, so keep this in mind for any large bookings.  Any more bodies and our group probably would have had to been split up into another room or uncomfortably squished.   I've never really had teppanyaki outside of an all inclusive vacation, but I really did not have any exceptions.   Just that the chefs were obvz going to do tricks lol.  Our chef was really nice and friendly.  Do they have classes to learn these tricks??  I wonder.  I was also surprised on how delicious the food was and the AMOUNT.  I couldn't even finish it!  I had to get a takeout box.  They take everyone's separate order.  I got chicken and steak.  Both were cooked to perfection!  Even the steak!  The veggies were delicious and you must get the fried rice.  Pay the extra $3.50.  If you get steamed rice, you'll be super jealous of the fried rice.  My friend was super jealous of mine and admitted he effed up on that lol.  My friend got salmon and steak and his salmon was friggin amazing!  You know why everything tastes so good?  GARLIC BUTTER.  They use garlic butter on evvverything.  Somehow it's not overbearing or too greasy.  For me at least.  Anyways, you also get miso soup, salad and ice cream with your meal.  All those were average, nothing amazing.  Exactly what you'd expect them to taste like.  I do enjoy it's an easy birthday spot.  No fuss ordering and everyone is entertained the whole time.  I would even consider having a birthday here."}
{"text":"Taste 3/5   Sushi were very small. Calamari very expensive for the amount we received.  Customer service 0   Service is a complete zero unfortunately  Asked server a question and he couldn't reply and made you feel like you were dumb. He was not that fluent in english. Which is ok. But he could have ask someone else to assist if he needed to but he didn't. Anyhow when we finished eating, we had to wait long to find a server to bring our bill as the original server was asleep at a table  Was disappointed with the experience was so excited initially"}
{"text":"The total experience completely depends on the Chef you have got for that evening... the first time, our Chef was great!! He gave a really lively performance and the food was great. My wife had Salmon Dinner, she said probably it's the best salmon she had in North America!!! Though our second time experience was not as good as the first one, in terms of Chef's performance and the taste of food both....  we realize, the total experience completely depends on the Chef you have got."}
{"text":"Teppenyaki was alright. In both the experience and food quality. Was it worth the price? Not really.  Food - the meal was good and it was very well cooked, but it honestly could also be something i make at home. I got the salmon set with fried rice, which was just so basic. The fried rice contained only onion and egg, and had WAY too much oil. The salmon was quite good but yet again was numbingly simple with a sear and coat of sauce. The salad was also depressingly just iceberg lettuce and a few drops of dressing.   Experience - chef was friendly, funny, and had a gppd personality. The cooking was fun to watch, but if you see if once you've seen it all. The cooking process was actually really fast.   Overall the food was mediocre for the price."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and delicious. I go here for lunch and dinner. Teppanyaki is great during dinner time, as the chefs will entertain the guests with tricks and jokes. I always have a great time."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekend with my boyfriend and his dad around 7pm. Didn't go for teppanyaki; we sat in the dining section, it was pretty empty for dinner time. We ordered edamame, a sashimi platter and a bento box to share. The quality of the food was average.. Everything was pretty basic. Bill came up to about $75 which was decent but the service was mediocre. We constantly needed to flag our server down for service, and we were never checked on.. Our server looked like he didn't want to be there. There are definitely better sushi places in the area."}
{"text":"We really liked the place. The chef was entertaining, the food was very good and what is very important prices were very reasonable comparing to other places like that. Will definitely come back if are in the area."}
{"text":"The dinner here is amazing!   When I feel like eating fancy sushi I come here with my boyfriend. We've come a few times throughout the years & we have never been disappointed. We've also ordered delivery since my place is within the boundaries.   We always order the Geisha roll. It's cross between a spicy salmon & red dragon roll. It also comes with this Samurai sauce which adds to the flavor. I really like how they have the sauce on the side rather than other places which drizzle it over the roll & then your roll is drowning.   We always order the combination dinners. For the amount you pay & the food you receive, I think it's well worth it. The tempura in these dishes are never oily, soggy or over battered. The portion sizes for the meat no matter what you decide to order - kalbi beer or chicken teriyaki - are always good sizes.   The pricing is comparable to most a la carte sushi places & I think there's a misconception this place is more expensive than others because it's got such a fancy interior. Maki rolls range from $5-$12 depending on what's in them. It's pretty much the same price one would pay at the next a la carte sushi place in Mississauga. I also think you're getting better quality here too.   This is one of the few places that get deep fried desserts right. We always order the deep fried cheesecake & the quality is always consistent.   I can't say much about the service except for it's hit or miss. It's like every other Asian restaurant for service so don't expect too much.   I'd go here again.   Five stars for one of the few a la carte sushi places left in Mississauga that still keep up quality."}
{"text":"Iron Chef, great for birthday, anniversaries basically anything with a big group, I mean why else would you go if it wasn't for the Teppanyaki.   i truly enjoy the experience here and the food is great. I prefer to go with a larger group to share in the experience, but sitting with strangers is not so bad for me either, unless the strangers are uptight (which has happened before).  The chefs are funny and they do an amazing job at keeping everyone entertained. The servers are prompt and quick with the service which is great.  I truly enjoyed this restaurant."}
{"text":"I order from Iron Chef about once a week and I had an unfortunate experience and will no longer be ordering from here anymore. I always order the hot night roll, it's my favourite. I went to go pick up my order which came to $60 and I noticed that on my bill it said I ordered the geisha roll instead of the hot night roll. This is the second time that this has happened except last time I had already brought my order home before I noticed and was not in the mood to bring it back.   I told the server that was cashing me out and her response was that that's not what you said on the phone. I would never order the geisha roll since i love the spicy tuna and that is what I always order. No apology. She just said it would be 10 minutes. After 20 minutes, I asked how much longer it would be. She said another 10 minutes. I asked an older looking man that worked there if I could speak to a manager but he informed me that there was absolutely no one that I could speak to on a Saturday at 7pm because the manager wasn't there. I informed the server that had cashed me out that I didn't make the mistake so I don't know why I am having to wait around. I should have priority since I called ahead for my order. I asked her to let the chefs know the situation and she didn't. I asked for a refund and I won't be returning. I have brought in so many customers to this restaurant and I am completely shocked at how I was treated.   I then went to Masamune on Dixie that is really close by and I will be going there for my weekly sushi. If you check out this article, http://www.insauga.com/mississaugas-top-5-japanese-restaurants Iron Chef is ranked last on their list. I found Masamune's sushi to be much fresher."}
{"text":"I have come to the Iron Chef several times before, but I had to write a review this time.  My boyfriend's birthday was last Friday, and I decided to throw him a surprise party at the Iron Chef, mainly because it is near his house, has amazing food, and is always a fun experience. I called about three weeks in advance and the man I spoke with was extremely helpful. I believe his name was Simon, as we were on the phone for a few minutes as I explained that this would be a surprise party, and he gave my his advice as to what time I should tell people to come and what time the guest should arrive at. Come last Tuesday, I called again to confirm my reservations, and everything was set to go. On Thursday, I got a call once more to confirm their will be 18 people, and if any more or less would be coming. I appreciated that because sometimes people will decide to bring a guest or not come, and the Iron Chef helped make me feel more organized.   Come Friday night, everybody was there by 8:00, and my reservations were for 8:30. Instead of making all the guests wait, they were seated early and had enough time to get settled in, which is great since I didn't want to walk in with my boyfriend while everyone was at the front entrance. Once we got there, I texted my cousin who was helping me organize along the way, and I asked her to ask the host/hostess to say reservations under my name for 2 instead of 18, as not to spoil the surprise (you never know if someone can easily slip up). When we got in, I told the host my name, and right away he said \"yes, reservations for 2, right?\" We walked in to have everyone seated, and my boyfriend was happily surprised! The food, if possible, was even better than the other times, and it is reasonably priced considering it is being cooked right in front of you as a show. Every single guest had an amazing time, finished all their dishes, and there was not one single mix up or error on the staff's part. After we finished our meal, the staff brought out a cake that I had made and everyone sang happy birthday. Although they did not cut the cake, I preferred that as I wanted to cut it myself, and they immediately brought plates and cutlery so no one was waiting. They brought everyone individual their own bill with absolutely no confusion, and even told us that they had already added a 15% gratuity tip, which is common in parties of 8 or more at most restaurants, but I liked how they did that as some people don't notice and end up tipping an extra 15%. I did not feel rushed, and they let us sit for a good half hour even after we had finished eating the cake and were just chitchatting. All in all, an excellent experience, and I cannot wait to go back! Iron Chef, you made planning and throwing a surprise birthday a complete success, and I want to thank you for your excellent food and service!"}
{"text":"This is a top notch Sushi and Tapanaki Japanese  restaurant.   My personal favorite thing is the crunch roll.  The cooking tables are always entertaining, a great choice for a small group celebrating a special occasion."}
{"text":"Terrible. Reserved a table for 8 for my close family, 3 weeks in advance. We arrived 20 minutes early, and they seated us in a FREEZING room. 40 minutes in and we're still freezing cold and hungry. They only had one chef in the room, which was cooking for the other family in front of us.   Not to mention, this is my first time trying a teppanyaki restaurant. I have never been so infuriated, especially during the holidays.   I wish I could've gave this place 0 stars.  Edit: I could not enjoy the food because I was freezing. I sat there for an hour and a half before I finally got up and moved into a warmer room. Why would you seat your customers in a freezing room and after visibly seeing them shivering not move them into a warmer room. Once again, I wish I can give them 0 stars."}
{"text":"I came here for my little nephew's birthday. We all had a great time here. The chef made food used his ninja skills and put on a show for us as he prepared our meals. I ordered the chicken and shrimp and it wasn't bad. I tried the steak from my wife's plate and it tasted great. I was surprised to have great steak at this place. They also give a generous serving which I was not expecting. I would recommend this for a special occasion if you haven't been before."}
{"text":"I feel like this place has a lot of potential but didn't bring its best. The menu had a great selection of Japanese dishes. The best part was a lot of the meals came with apps and dessert. I went with teriyaki chicken, it came with a miso soup and salad. According to the menu, it was also supposed to come with ice cream but we never got that. We didn't have time to discuss it so we paid and left. Over all, the food was decent but could have been better."}
{"text":"Horrible found 2 flies in my water. Waiter just looks confused doesn't even apologize. I had to tell him 3 times there is flies and to get me a coke! Idiots I swear smh. Food is like any other Chinese owned teppanyaki."}
{"text":"Despite the name, you won't find Chairman Kaga waxing glorious fables about foodstuffs here. You will however see talented chefs spin knives, flip vegetables, and grill your dinner with flair (and flames!) right before your eyes. The Teppanyaki table lets diners sit in a large 'U' with other diners around a large flat grill. The performance of dinner preparation is entertaining and amusing, as the chefs prepare your meals while performing ridiculous stunts. If you want to, you can also sit at a \"normal\" table which involves ordering from a menu and not watching someone balance an egg on the edge of a spatula but that sounds LAME. I'd go back soon if this place wasn't in the middle of nowhere, i.e., not walking distance from club district.  Obligatory Title Pun: More like Teppan-WACKY.  Menu Readability: I had trouble with it; could be a lot simpler.  Basically, if you're getting Teppanyaki, you just pick your type of meat and they do the rest.  Need to mention: The windows were wide open in our dining room, and we were freezing. It warmed up once the grilling started, but I'd bring a sweater in the winter.  What this place teaches me about myself: Light a stack of onions on fire and you've won me over, forever."}
{"text":"Surprised at all the super negative reviews, I've been here 3 or 4 times and have never had an issue with service, but it probably all depends on the day you go. Unfortunately this place only gets 3 stars from me, as the food is pretty average, and it's a little overpriced for what you get. I'd still come back once in awhile, but only if I feel like treating myself. Atmosphere is super lovely, but last time I went there was kind of a gross smell."}
{"text":"I feel like I've been twice. Really - first and last at the same time. We had a groupon to ease the price plus based on previous reviews I was eager to see tepanayaki chef in action. We walked in at 5 PM to a completely empty restaurant - a waiter asked if we had reservations ! The menu is a mess - I mean some are missing pages so we shared the more extensive one. We found one seemingly interesting offer - dinner for one at $18.80 : miso soup, salad, 2 spring rolls, choice of chicken or beef teriyaki , tea and ice cream. Groupon was for $30 so we picked two of the above. Our waiter said that it was a tepanayaki part of the restaurant and led us to another part of the restaurant. We were asked to sit elbow to elbow with a family of 6 - I don't particularly enjoy communal meals with strangers unless I travel. The chef was sorta cool - social, experienced. One of our 6 elbow neighbours had  a birthday so he created a fried rice heart for her. Nice touch. Miso and salad came instantly. Followed by a bowl of rice. And spring rolls. Miso, salad were long gone. Rice became cold. Veggies came to start shivering next to cold rice. Finally chicken teriyaki to warm up the cold rice and veggies. Then... nothing. The elbowing family of 6 was asked if they wanted ice cream - vanilla, chocolate or mango. They all chose chocolate. They disputed the bill as the kid was charged adult fare. We kept waiting for the desert. The next set of people - an Asian couple with a small kid and an Indian couple with a kid sat next to us. The next chef on their side was a kid who had no idea what he was doing. He was not socializing, made several mistakes. He left a male of the Asian couple without chicken teriyaki because he either delivered double chicken to the Indian guy or not enough dead chicken was placed on the tray so in the end one guy had to eat his chicken teriyaki on its own. This is while we are waiting for tea and ice cream. As nothing is happening I called one of the waiters wearing glasses to ask about the rest. He said it was not included. I asked him to bring a menu then he disappeared. I went to the another part of the restaurant, found a menu which happened to have all the pages and showed it to the binacled  server. He deferred it to our initial server who said that it was a new menu and no one knew it. I then asked why after the meal no one asked if we wanted tea, coffee, or whatever - no answer. Our server offered a choice of chocolate or mango ice cream (mind you - the family of 6 was offered vanilla, mango or chocolate). I hate vanilla and dislike chocolate - both of us asked for mango. Then the server brought us vanilla ice cream. When I pointed it out to the server he said sorry but did not offer to replace it. When I asked about the manager he sort of stopped understanding English. This about sums it up for my double (1st and last) visit to this chaotic place.  Food wise - it was okay but a bowl of cold rice with cold veggies spoiled it."}
{"text":"One of the better Japanese restaurants in the east end of Mississauga, always busy during the lunch rush but fast, friendly service and a great menu.  Very fresh sushi and sashimi, and a variety of Bento boxes and lunch specials."}
{"text":"I booked a table here for teppenyaki for my brother's birthday for 6:30pm but they didn't start until 7pm when more people arrived at our table/grill which was annoying. I wished they gave times for me to choose from instead of having me choose and then wait. They also charge extra for fried rice ($3.50) which makes sense but just be aware that they don't tell you it's extra. Our chef was great, knew what he was doing and was pretty funny. Great teppenyaki show and the food was super tasty. I got the beef and shrimp combo and both were cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here almost a year ago for the Teppanyaki, some winter night, when we first started dating. The windows weren't opened on our night, unlike other reviewers' nights, so that was gooooddd.  1 appetizer, we shared the entree, 2 drinks. Our bill didn't end up too expensive :)  We ordered the Cherry Blossom Mushrooms for our appetizer, a dish of 3 big mushrooms, stuffed with scallop? (I forgot), plus crab sauce. It was so nicely presented, and the mushrooms were very juicy. I remember I liked it a lot :)  We ordered the chicken, came with fried rice, soup, ice cream? (says the website menu) I don't remember the dessert??? I was SO glad we shared it because there was a LOT of fried rice, and I couldn't finish my share.   The chef! He was sooooo brilliant. He started off with a knives show, then some cutting onions action, FIRE, and then eggs spectacular. He was very good :) but it seemed like this was routine to him, and he seemed bored when he was doing it.  Still a wonderful experience. Food wasn't WOW amazing, but I liked the presentation a loooottt."}
{"text":"Its been a while since I visited, but I had to write as I had another great experience.  Our teppanyaki Chef Nova was great, he interacted with us, made jokes and was a pleasure to have serve us.   Will definitely be back!"}
