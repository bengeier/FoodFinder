{"text":"Well white spot.... Now you've gone and done it. We have been coming to the white spot for years and noticing the service start to tank. It's been three or four times of hour and a half plus meals because of service/not enough staff/no glasses/no cutlery. I honestly feel bad for the staff having to deal with hordes of angry people on a regular basis. Pity, because the food is always good. No more white spot for me, I'll be taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here with some co-workers and ordered myself the Nat's Hearty Breakfast: 2 eggs, 2 strips of bacon, 2 sausages, hashbrowns & a choice of buttermilk pancakes or toast (I got the toast). All were very good. I've been a fan of White Spot breakfasts for years and was not disappointed this time around. Unfortunately, the service was less than stellar."}
{"text":"I know it's not a fine dining place, but since the place calls itself a restaurant my husband and I still expect to be seated at a clean table, get clean cutlery/plates/glasses, and be served decent quality food. Well, at White Spot even that is not guaranteed. We changed tables and requested a complete change of cutlery due to dirty marks and leftover food bits spotted everywhere. They didn't bother to bring napkins, I had to go and fetch those myself. Both coffee mugs were stained with someone else's lipstick.The waitress we had the unluck to get at this last visit was slow, indifferent and absolutely incompetent. She offered a coffee refill and emptied all the dregs and grits into my mug, getting it half full and cheerfully adding that it's all she had at the moment. She seemed genuinely surprised when I asked her to take the whole thing away and bring me a fresh cup, please. The kitchen couldn't get the food out for 40 minutes, and when it finally did my salad was missing half the ingredients it was supposed to have. The manager who handled our complaint was desperately trying to find at least some positive aspects in our experience so that we would still pay at least part of our bill. Couldn't find any: we wasted time, didn't get to eat or drink, and received half an apology at best. Won't set foot in White Spot ever again. Broken Plate (Greek cuisine) in the vicinity is a superb place to eat out on the same budget."}
{"text":"Just went there for the first time...loved the food, tastey  very well crafted..even better we had the niciest server  I think her name was Candace?
we had a blast and we will definitely go back...soon
If you haven't been there..its a nice place for a good lunch you will love it"}
{"text":"Last time we ate at White Spot left an impression on us - my well done steak was burnt to a crisp. Yes, I know it might not be the way to eat steak but my little one was nibbling from my plate so medium-rare was out of the question.

My spouse was a professional cook and he too liked the breakfast, but just shook his head disapprovingly when he tried my steak.

We used to come for breakfast all the time and the food was always very good and the staff were pleasant. I might be tempted to stop for breakfast again but I'll stay away at dinner."}
{"text":"Two burgers, a diet coke and a coffee. 34.50 .add tip and your at almost 40 bucks . The burgers are great but that's unreasonable."}
{"text":"I recently went here for Brunch on a Saturday. It was busy enough but not one of those places you need to wait in line to get a table in. Decor was nice and the washrooms were also very clean - which is important, right?

The service was quick and efficient without being overbearing. They have a pretty good range of breakfast items, although nothing really signature or \"different\". The food was served hot and the coffee was quite good.

The taste of the food was good and it was a great quality. However it was pricey for breakfast - three meals was well over $60. Given the \"chain\" feel I am not sure it needed to be quite that much. Honestly if it was a bit cheaper I probably would have given it 4 stars.

Id go back if I was in the neighbourhood but I wouldn't go out of my way otherwise."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for years.  We especially like the brunch on Saturdays.  If you want a great server, ask for Pam.  She is a true gem!"}
{"text":"I love the food  the service is amazing it is so family friendly and the triple \"O\" sauce is Like nothing I've ever had"}
{"text":"Took old friends from out of town here for lunch . Good service selection of food . All commented on how much they enjoyed their meal. Will return again."}
{"text":"We recently moved to Calgary from Vancouver and the sustained weeks of sub-zero temperatures had me longing for the west coast. It wasn't quite the same as a trip to the coast but a lesser option was to visit Vancouver's own restaurant tradition the White Spot. 

Entering this White Spot was like entering every White Spot in the Lower Mainland - same decor and same menu. We ordered things that we were really familiar with, and they did not disappoint. My BC Chicken burger with yam fries and a spot salad on the side was excellent. The chicken was moist and you can't beat the Triple-O sauce. I almost wish I could temporarily unhinge my jaw so I could take a full bite of the thing as the burger was so tall! My yam fries could have spent another 30 seconds in the fryer to crisp them up but the chipotle dip was tasty. My husband ordered a beef dip and his sandwich was stacked with a lot of meat.

Our server was pleasant and efficient. Overall, a good experience and we will return when in the Willowpark/South Centre area."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's the dreary area where this store is but this Whitespot did it's job of being subpar and satisfying my curiosity that it hasn't really gotten better or worse since the last time I visited it six years ago.

I decided to stop by here for a quick breakfast and figured that for a restaurant, I could get food here quickly. And I was right, there were few people in the restaurant for a Friday morning. I ordered their breakfast chicken burrito. It was warm and staved off that new-winter freeze everyone gets in November but after my first half I struggled with the motivation to finish the other half, it tastes like what Denny's would serve without salt or msg. They also served this weird version of hashbrowns where they took bits of potato and shoved it into a shuriken mold and pressed out shuriken potatoes. Too bad I left my phone on my desk b/c I wanted to take a picture of those ninja cakes. They weren't bad to be honest, but after half of one I felt quite full.

Side note, not to make a first world problem out of it, but when I asked for tobassco sauce they gave me a bottle of half hot sauce and half water-so-we-can-save-money-by-fading-out-our-condiments.

I didn't have shitty or bland enough of an experience to warrant a three star but I feel a four star is being generous. I wouldn't come back here again, at least for another six years when I'll need potato shurikens to fight off the zombies.

{"text":"You want classic, comforting Canadian dining? White Spot is THE PLACE to get it.

They have everything from burgers and shakes to stir-fry and strips. Everything has a consistent, feel good taste and the (delicious) fries are bottomless.

Dawg, don't even GET this ninja started on that triple-O sauce. I doubt there is a Canadian left out there who has not experienced this.

There will always be a spot in my heart for White Spot. The end."}
{"text":"We ate at the White Spot Restaurant after shopping in the Willow Park area on December 23rd.  DH and I ordered items not on their regular menu, but were on a supplemental menu:  the halibut burger with fries and two pieces of halibut with fries.  The food was good and was served promptly by our waiter.  The restaurant was busy, but not overly so.  The noise level was not excessive and there were no line-ups at the door!  The decor was nice and welcoming.  The restaurant was clean and tidy.  Overall it was a good experience and we plan on going back next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Love a good white spot burger. The staff here are great to talk with. Never had a problem here. Food is consistently great, service is quick, and the cleanliness is on par. Great place to go for a decent price."}
{"text":"WTF?!

They completely changed the menu and got rid of all their omelettes????

White Spot, your breakfast offerings are terrible now."}
{"text":"If your looking for a good burger at a very reasonable price, this is the place to go.  AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"This place is in the same category as Boston Pizza or Kelsey's and has a homey feel to it.  The food is fine as has been mentioned but for me, it lacks ambiance some how.  Its just not memorable for some reason and for me that's a let down.  Even if we go to a dive, we're looking for a memory and there just isn't one here."}
{"text":"This is one of the better chains that exists in Western Canada.  The food has always been good and the service excellent on my many visits to this location."}
