{"text":"Decided to start here on our search for the best fish and chips in Mississauga. We're English so we know good fish and chips. I had haddock, OH had halibut. Both were excellent. Even the chips were good. The mushy peas were as good as any I've had."}
{"text":"A quaint little fish and chip joint. The fish and chips are stellar, I've had the halibut on a few occassions and the fish is fresh and batter done absolutely perfectly. The scallops are also good as me and my girlfriend like to split them between us. Not a lot of seats but I've never had to wait either."}
{"text":"Good fish and chips, nice family owned atmosphere, close to beautiful Port Credit.  Awesome halibut and chips"}
{"text":"Having come here for many years, Country Fish & Chips offers some of the best halibut I've had outside of Nova Scotia.  While I'm still not over the fact that they charged me double for a haddock lunch combo a few years back, I contend that they're one of the best fish and chip joints in Mississauga.  The batter is generally crisp and not soggy, the fries are standard quality and the portion sizes are quite good. I'm the type who likes to drown his fish in tartar sauce, so I always appreciate the fact that each table is stocked with packets of tartar. I usually pop 3-4 packets on my fish every time I go. I also love their coleslaw, and almost always end up buying a large container just for myself.  The staff are also very friendly and chatty (at least with me), and it usually isn't packed, meaning you can grab a table easily despite the small dining room.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Cute and cozy little restaurant that my husband and I decided to go to for lunch on a whim.  Literally looked at the map and picked it out.  We are so glad we did!  Small 8 table place that is clean and cutely decorated.  We both had the Greenland halibut.  Phenomenal!! The batter was crispy with nice flavor.  The fish was obviously fresh and perfectly cooked.  The fries were super good too and as another reviewer mentioned, had just the right amount of 'crispy bits'.  I highly recommend!  We will definitely go back when we got the itch for some good fish-n-chips."}
{"text":"This place has been a neighbourhood pillar for decades. Great food with a simple menu and charming decor. The staff are very nice and helpful people.   Their batter on the halibut is big and crispy and cooked to perfection. Tartar is available at the table with no additional charge (packets).  Fries are crispy double fried deliciousness with light salt. White and malt vinegar is available at the table.   If you are in the area for lunch and haven't had fish n chip for ages than country fish n chips is the place to return, over and over again!"}
{"text":"Quaint country style fish and chips.  I liked this place a lot. They do a great halibut dinner. The quality of fish was very nice, and the batter was crisp, not doughy or greasy. The french fries were obviously hand cut and had a nice crisp exterior, but were a little soft (I prefer a firmer chip). The accoutrement (coleslaw, dinner role, tea) were nothing to write home about, but that's easy to overlook when the fish is so good.   The restaurant itself is very small (6 tables, though I believe they offer take-out) and has a nice familial vibe.  With tip, our meal (2 fish dinners, 2 drinks, tip) came to about $25. I'd go back when I'm in the mood for fish & chips again."}
{"text":"I found the food options limited, most of which were fried. On the flipside, the table setup was comfortable and the service was very personal. I would have liked to see a grilled option for the fish (perhaps I overlooked it?), and options for vegetables aside from fries. The name of the restaurant perhaps I didn't take literally enough."}
{"text":"Up there with the best fish and chips I have ever had...  FIsh is fresh. Batter is nothing short  of outstanding. Fries are delicious, obviously hand-cut with just enough small crispy bits. Good value and run by lovely people. What more could you want.  Only thing I missed was a garlic mayo. But the rest was so good, I didn't even miss it.   If you like fish & chips, you need to check this place out!"}
{"text":"We regularly enjoy Country Fish and Chips. They are a fantastic option when you have that craving. Almost always order halibut. Great portions. Really nice owners. Heartily recommended."}
{"text":"classic fish and chips.  the gravy is good.  just like how a fish and chip place should be."}
{"text":"Excellent fish and chips and at a very good price.  Proud to say this is my go to restaurant.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Some of the best fish and chips I've ever had. I actually ordered through skip the dishes and was worried about the travel time (I'm about 15-20 mins away) but the reviews were so good that I decided to take a chance and I'm glad I did. The food was still hot and fish was crispy. The fries were good. Nothing spectacular or different from any of the other fish and chips places but the real star was their fish. The batter is great and so yummy. The portion size for what I paid was more than fair. I just wish my first order code of 10% off worked.   I'll definitely order again and will stop through if im ever in the area."}
{"text":"Classic fish and chips spot. The menu is simple with 3 kinds of fish offered, sides, burgers, sodas, milkshakes. It's a nice spot to stay and eat. The food came quickly. We had the halibut dinner. It was a big beautiful meaty piece of fish, the batter perfectly crisp and golden brown. The fresh cut fries were crisp and fluffy. The coleslaw was heavy on the mayo, but also crunchy and tangy. We also ordered the calamari which is battered popcorn-style and for $6.50, it cannot be beat. It's a rich and greasy meal, but oh so good."}
{"text":"Our Goto fish and chip place. There halibut is amazing... The coleslaw is also a favourite add on. Really nice people and perfect ... Never a bad experience after take out from here many times."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  It a tiny hole in the wall, with super friendly peeps and the BEST fish and chips in town!  Prices reflect the quality of food and the portion sizes.  The place is clean and quaint.  A must visit if you are in Port Credit."}
{"text":"Love it! The only place we go now. Fantastic fish, great service. Decent prices."}
{"text":"It's not a place that's gonna blow you away, but the fish and chips might be the best I ever had. The fries were okay, but nothing out of the ordinary. They do however have some nice side choices."}
{"text":"A cute and cozy fish and chips place in Port Credit.  We usually go to Helen's but decided to try a new place after reading some negative reviews on Yelp.  We got the haddock fish and chips ($10) which comes with medium sized piece of fish and a handful of fries.  Fish was good, not too greasy.  Fries were average, nothing special about 'em.  We would go back if we were in the area but not really worth travelling all the way out to Port Credit for."}
