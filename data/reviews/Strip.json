{"text":"First, let me just preface by saying I really like Strip.  I've always like their food.  I can't remember a bad food experience.  After I write this review, I'll continue to go to Strip.  Let me get straight to my point for this review....the Moscow Mule beverage.  I like this drink.  It's a very unique and refreshing beverage to serve.  But to my dismay last night, my Moscow Mule was not served in the traditional copper mug.  It was served in a glass.  Anybody who's probably ordered one might tell you, it's not a Moscow Mule unless it has the copper mug.  I agree with that statement absolutely!  So when the drink arrived at my table, my server politely told me that they aren't serving in copper mugs because restaurant patrons have stolen these mugs....that's shameful by the way.  I was clearly disappointed, but still accepted the drink, but at the same time told him that they should make it clear to patrons that the drink wouldn't be served in the copper mug, or it should be taken off the menu.  About 10 minutes later, I see another server walking by with a copper mug.  At that time, I stopped her and asked how it was possible I received my drink in a glass, but another patron was getting their drink in a copper mug.  I was told that it was up to the server because they've had so many thefts of the copper mugs.  This was somewhat of a laughable moment and I proceeded to ask myself and then my wife, \"Do I look like a guy that would take the copper mug?\"    So for this reason, and to my annoyance, Strip is getting 2 stars.  By the way, I would have gladly conveyed my experience to a manager, had one stopped by to ask how my dining experience was going.   Word of recommendation, let people know about the Moscow Mule, sans copper mug, if they fit the profile, or put that minor footnote in your menu."}
{"text":"I was very excited to go here for our Anniversary. I knew it was expensive but I have to say not a very good value. The place was nice, clean, waitress was great but for $40 can I at least get a potato and a salad with my steak? Potato was huge but $7 more, salad or soup was an additional $5. So that's about $52 for a steak dinner. Pretty steep for Avon Ohio. Lots of nearby places that have good food a lot less money. I would rate the place/staff 4 stars, value a 2."}
{"text":"For my birthday, my children bought dinner at Strip's.  First time eating here. Loved the interior, the whole staff was very friendly, knowledgeable and fun. The food for me was great. My daughter had a pasta dish that had too much garlic. My son and I had the petite filet. If it wasn't so expensive and everything being ala carte, I would go back. With no alcohol, our bill was $190 with tip for 3.  Good place for special occasions."}
{"text":"Our server was friendly and professional. My husband and I shared a 32oz Australian wagyu which melted in our mouths. The meat was tender and seasoned to perfection. The plate came with homemade seasoned chips which complemented the meat. We got dessert drinks of Port and chocolate amore + a nice decadent caramel espresso cake. It was all worth it!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had!  We stumbled upon The Strip from YELP and a recommendation from the cashier at Old Navy. Cool building, and excellent food. The steak was delicious. If you've never tried a dry-aged steak. It is worth it!!  The Mac and cheese was awesome!"}
{"text":"We went this restaurant last week - looking for a place to eat before a football game.  We had a difficult time finding it - as it is not right on Detroit - but is located in a location back from the main road.  The filets were seriously the best we have had in years - prepared perfectly to order - with an interesting butter or sauce choice.  We both chose the blue cheese butter - heavenly!  The salads were crisp with tangy tasty dressing!  The pasta dishes, however, were heavy and did not really compliment the steak.  The lobster pasta was the better of the ones we tried. The waitress was knowledgeable about the restaurant and the food.  The atmosphere was great - great bar with changing lights below!   We would definitely return for some more of that steak!"}
{"text":"My husband and I dine at steak for all of our big events and it's amazing-EVERY time.  The price is really very fair for the high quality of food you get and we always leave stuffed!  I would recommend this to anyone.    The atmosphere in this restaurant is very trendy and unique.  It has a warm rustic feel with the quality of a very high end place.  Coolest place around here by far!    If you go definitely get the Mac and Cheese as a side, AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"So delicious! My husband and I recently had dinner here and were very pleased with the food and service. We were seated upstairs, which I would recommend, and we ordered the Dinner for Two, which came with the complimentary pretzel sticks, two salads, two sides, two 6oz. filets, and a dessert to share. Our waiter, Joel, was friendly and attentive, and offered many recommendations along the way. The complimentary pretzel sticks were a great start. The salads were ok, hardly any dressing, but it didn't matter, because we were mostly looking forward to the main entree. We ordered the scalloped potatoes and cream corn as sides and they came out in two huge dishes. I mean, massive portions. They were tasty, but nothing above average. The steaks on the other hand - they were to die for! They were both cooked perfectly. The blue cheese sauce that came with mine was good, but the steak itself was so delicious, I ate most of mine without the sauce. By far one of the best steaks I've ever had. Before we were even finished with our meal, we were already talking about coming back. We ordered the Tirassata as dessert, which was nice and light after a heavy meal. Also delicious. We'll definitely be returning, although we both agreed, we'll skip all the extras and just order a nice, juicy steak!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere food and service!  Mike was very knowledgable about the menu.  I highly recommend the filet or the lamb!  We took family for out of town and they were extremely impressed."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I Came to strip for our anniversary and had reservations. When we came in we were sat at a small table in the corner and our waitress did not come to greet us for over 15 minutes, by now we're slightly annoyed being that we drove 40 minutes to come to the restaurant finally she did come but it literally took one hour just to get our food we had the dinner for two so 2 steaks and 2 sides should not take an hour to prepare but we were patient then we ordered a dessert and when the waitress brought it to us the ice cream was completely melted and she apologized for it being \"soft\" needless to say the trip out there was not worth it and we will not be returning"}
{"text":"My waiter asked if I wanted a second glass of wine. I was undecided but I said yes, IF you can bring it right away while I'm still finishing my dinner. It seemed like a clear enough request and though I stalled and stalled taking those last few bites, it didn't happen. Then they put the second glass of wine ($16) on the bill anyway. My steak, a center cut ribeye with spice rub, was decent-- the rub and sauce were really good but the steak itself was tough."}
{"text":"Hands down best steakhouse in the Cleveland area. The dinner is perfection from salad to dessert. The steak is cooked perfectly and I suggest getting the garlic butter as a topper. My husband and I chose the lobster pasta as our side and it had huge chunks of lobster in it, very good. Would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Sooo, I am going to start with the (very) good and then explicate the nonsense of why I give this place a 1 star- gladly would I give it lower but yelp doesn't permit that.  the good: 1) The steaks: PERFECTLY seasoned and cooked to pefection. truly. Thumbs up. 2) The wine list- was pretty good. not as good as the steaks, mind you, but it had a nice balance and variety. 3) The server and floor people were good - see exception below.  now the bad: I will never go here again. You might think I'm crazy given my overall laudatory comments above; however, consider the following:  The music. This is the third time I have been to this place in a few years and each time I am there the music is BLARING. WHAT THE HELL? If I'm going pay premium dollars for food I want to be able to enjoy it along with the conversation. Not have sounds of classic rock blaring. I mean, REALLY, who the hell wants to listen to Pink Floyd's The Wall while eating a steak. I mean, other than the obvious irony... NO! So, Each time I have been here I have asked the waiter to lower it and each time I get the same \"I'll try, but the owner...\". This time I pushed the issue a little further. After some prodding she told me \"we get complaints about the music ALL the time but the owner is a jerk and it is pretty clear he will fire anyone who changes the music\".   WTF? Ok, so let me get this straight, you get complaints all the time about this issue and the owner will punish employees who try to accommodate patrons. If true- in my view- that's a reason not to go. The hubris and arrogance- it reminds me of those a-hole owners who Gordon Ramsey gives the restaurant make-overs on TV. You know the ones who a world-class chef is trying to help and they can't see the forest for the trees and are obstinate jerks.  This leads me to the other point.  So, I ordered an appetizer. Rellano Pepper. What was brought to the table was inedible. From what I can tell It was a microwaved pepper with some kind of strange pancake on top. It was, quite frankly, garbage. The center was hot and the outside was cold to the touch (which is why I think it was microwaved). At any rate, I took two bites (the disk was the size of the entire dish). I sent it back. I could see the waitress in the kitchen having a tense conversation with a pony-tailed male (turns out he's the owner). The waitress comes back and tells me that the owner stated that I ate too much of the dish and I will have to pay for it. I told her to tell him to come out and speak to me directly and I will tell him why the dish is crap. Apparently, that was not a conversation she wanted to get into the middle of. I told her \"look, I'm sorry you are in the middle of this but this is garbage\" she stated \"yes, I know but I'm stuck\". Somehow, she was able to get the item discreetly removed from the bill. Good thing, too.  I spoke with another waiter who I had met before as I was waiting by the front door - for the rest of my party to assemble to leave. He told me a similar story about the owner being not terribly open to criticism or reasonable.  OWNER: Get your mind right. You don't have Michelin Star or some other accolade that justifies any kind of arrogance on your part. It's loud. Period. BTW- the next night I was at Lolita's and it was loud there. you know why? It's packed with people and they talk. But, imagine a crowded \"Strip\" with the Doors blaring in the background. Seriously- the word incongruity doesn't go far enough. And, if someone sends a dish back that is barely touch b/c it's crap and you want to put the waiter in the middle of the customer and yourself - then have the guts to have the damn conversation in reference to the customer.   At any rate... for my money I'd rather go to the many choices in Tremont or downtown."}
{"text":"We went to Red, Strip and Hyde Park within a six week period.  Here are my thoughts:  Went to Strip for Father's day.  It was light years ahead of any steak we have ever had.  We always get filet and recently had the chance to compare fine steak dining.  We ate at Red, the downtown location, about 6 weeks ago and it was nice.  We dined at Hyde Park, Westlake, yesterday and again it was nice.  But they cannot hold a candle to Strip. Strip's meat was well aged, tender beyond belief, and delicious in flavor. The sides were generous, mind-blowing in flavor,  and there were many to choose from.  The mac and cheese was unbelievable; we also loved the spinach. We chose the dinner for two which was two 6 oz. filets served with two house salads or soups of the day, two very large sides, and a huge dessert (homemade cheese cake, so yummy, for $88.  We even took home leftovers. It was a lovely experience.  We now know where to go if we want the best steak available in our area.  Without hesitation it will be Strip."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner here as a party of 4 on a Friday night.  Not too busy but we had already made reservations.  My first reaction was that I loved the atmosphere.  It had a modern swanky atmosphere that was very enjoyable.  The dinner table was dressed lovely with the modern place setting.    We ordered drinks (I didn't care for mine; had the pear vodka with cucumbers and splenda...leave out the splenda and some of the cucumbers...it was gross) and a few appetizers to share.  They were good, and we really enjoyed the crab cakes.    My instinct was to convince my husband to order the \"dinner for 2\" but he insisted that he wanted to try something else.  I ordered a small filet with a blackberry sage sauce along with a salad.  Pretzel bread came to the table and this was great.  The peanut butter - butter was ok, but the pretzel bread tastes good to me as is.    As a table we split two sides; the scalloped potatoes and the highly recommended broccoli and corn dish.  The potatoes were far better than the broccoli.  We also tried the red velvet cheesecake, and it was enjoyable.    At the end of the meal I came to the conclusion that the price was far to high and that I would highly recommend the dinner for 2 because it is a much better price than ordering a la carte.   All in all, it was good, not great and I would recommend it but I would also let people know that it is fairly expensive.  My husband, on the other hand did not agree with me and would not recommend it.  He ordered the \"stripper\" and said it was just ok."}
{"text":"I visited the restaurant to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday back on a Friday in Dec '16. The steak was great and the sides were plentiful. Service was attentive and friendly. They even brought out a complimentary bday cake which was great. Overall, it would have been a great experience except for 2 aspects. I have to deduct some stars based on our overall experience.   The parking situation was poor based on the number of available spots and size of the spots. The lot was also very icy and I had to catch my girlfriend to keep her from slipping and face planting.   Even worse was the table we were seated at. We had a reservation and my girlfriend was asked if a bar top table was okay. That was fine but what didn't sit well was the big pole we had to stare at all dinner. Talk about a feng shui nightmare. We were not forewarned about that pole, the tiny table and the fact that people would be crowding us and staring at us while we ate and they waited to order a drink at the bar. The menus were seriously bigger than the table and we ran out of room quickly. I get that they do a lot of business and are regularly packed but I would be embarrassed to seat someone at that horrible table. Now contrast that location with the spacious lounge chairs and floor table nearby and you have to wonder how they would could waste so much space there and force a tiny table next to the wooden vertical support beam pole.   The pole table either needs to be removed and the space opened for standing bar patrons or, they should remove the stools and just utilize it as a secondary bar counter space only for patrons to stand by and place their drinks on. Also, if the the lounge chairs and coffee table were removed, an additional 2 decent size tables could be placed there instead."}
{"text":"Went here for special occasion. The ambience, in what appears to be a remodeled old barn, is very cool. The food was good and had more options than you'd expect from a higher end steakhouse. Just be aware that the sides feed well over 2 people (which is what the menu claims). This was a bit of annoyance as we ordered way to many for the group and the server didn't warn us. I get it, I used to be a server but a little heads up would have been appreciated. As well the server was generally awkward kind of putting a small damper on the mood but whatevs. Overall, at this price point I would choose Cabin Club or XO over Strip."}
{"text":"Fun date night restaurant. Good steaks. Very nice overall atmosphere! Gluten-free friendly which is a big plus in our book!"}
{"text":"What a gem this place is.  Went for the first time for an anniversary dinner.  Dina, our server, was fabulous.  Food was outstanding.  Decor lovely.  All in all.....my new favorite."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Strip on numerous occasions and I am never disappointed!  The service is always amazing and overly accommodating and of course, the food is outstanding.  I am pretty sure that my husband and I have tried every dish, and always fight over the leftovers!  The portions are great, side dishes are huge and can be shared by 3-4 people.  I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants an amazing dining experience!"}
{"text":"Has got to be one of the best restaurants in Cleveland!!  Perfect food, good service.  We have only had one bad server here in 2 years of going.  The food is always spot on and when it not it is corrected on the spot.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Highly recomend by friends. Worse service I have ever had. Jim our waitermust have thought he was Houdini, keep pulling a disappearing act and would be gone for 10 minutes or longer. When I received my steak it was under cooked and cold. I Emailed Strip on Monday the 18th and have still to get a  response from them.This was for my girlfriends Birthday bad expereince for her birthday. Waiter very off putting."}
{"text":"I'll start with the good stuff and get to the complaining later. I took my girlfriend there for our one year anniversary.When I made the reservation they had an option to have flowers waiting at the table.The flowers were there as promised and beautiful.Our waiter Jo Jo \"the name on the ticket\", was nothing short of top notch.He knew the menu and specials by heart with all the details. The manager, a young lady whose name I can't recall was also very friendly. We were seated upstairs,the decor was nice but relaxed. We both had drinks, mine was a black jack,which was very good.My girlfriend had the striptini it was very strong and she didn't like it much. The black jack was $12.00 the striptini was $11.00. The pretzel bread, courtesy of the house was quite good,especially with the peanut butter. Next we had the pizza what ?. Flatbread pizza with strips of steak and pieces of lobster $8.00. I thought this one was a real bargain, the portion was just right for 2 and worth every penny. We also had the bleu cheese and bacon tater tots $8.00. These were pretty large,about 2 1/2 inches each and 4 of them with a nice mustard dip. We both loved these. Next up were our main courses. I had the barrel cut 12 oz. filet with the bacon bleu cheese compound butter $39.00, and an optional 10 oz. lobster tail $20.00. Both of these were unbelievable. The filet was melt in your mouth, truly one of the best steaks I've ever had. The lobster tail was very sweet. My girlfriend had the catch of the day $26.00. It was sea bass with cranberry and almond I believe, with some nice baby pears that were really tasty. After the pretzels and 2 appetizers she was pretty full by then though and took most of it home, along with most of the lobster pasta we had ordered as a side.OK, now for the complaints. We ordered the tirassata cake $10.00 to go since we were full.This cake was like 50/50 tiramisu and cassata cake. I thought this cake was kind of weird,the filling was good but the cake tasted a bit hard as if it was stale. I really didn't care for it much especially at $10.00. One of my other complaints is the entrance. Our reservation was for 8:30 and it was total dark by then, we actually passed the restaurant because there was no sign near the street. My last complaint is there is no waiting area. We were a few minutes early for our reservation and were told we could wait at the bar. There was nowhere to simply sit and wait for your table without the pressure of buying a drink. Fairly small complaints I would say and I would gladly go back. Though not too often simply because the prices are beyond my regular budget."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that we have been to this restaurant and had a good meal and service, but our service experience this last time was so bad that we will not be back for a long time.  We came for hapy hour on a Friday night, and with it being Lent my wife heard that they have good Lenten specials.  We sat at the bar and ordered a glass of wine for each of us and we had to ask for a menu and then had to ask for the Happy Hour Menu and what the Lenten specials were for the night and the soup of the day. The real issue was when we recevied the bill there was an extra glass of wine on it. I mentioned this to the bartender and she snapped back that the bill was correct and she didn't charge us for an extra glass which she most definitely did.  This was a dishonest act and one that can not be ignored so we will not be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! A very unique barn atmosphere. The mac and cheese is a must try along with any of their CAB prime graded steaks. The patio is fantastic for drinks and appetizers along with full menu availability."}
{"text":"Passing through from Dallas, Texas checked out Yelp for advice on dinner and  what great advice I got!!!  Dinner was wonderful.  The atmosphere was comfortable, the staff was very professional and the food was fantastic... What more can one say!! This is a must if your in the neighborhood.  If I have to share a negative, it would be as others have said .... kinda dark....not romantic dark, just dark.  Ah, who cares it is charming... Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite restaurant!  After moving to Avon from Westlake, we wanted a new steak place closer to home that would rival our usual stops - Hyde Park and Cabin Club - we found that at Strip.  We've never had a bad meal there.  We love the mussels, the filets, and the lobster bisque!  Great patio in the summer!"}
{"text":"Again strip never disappoints! Great food, drinks and service! Like to make a shout out to Charlie! Charlie is the new manager at strip! He always took such great care if us when he was a server there. He stopped at our table last night to chat and was just as nice! So happy he got promoted!"}
{"text":"Frequented this establishment multiple times and have yet to be disappointed. Doesn't matter if it is sit-down, or ponying up to the bar, it is the same service with a smile. Appetizers to dessert are prepared to expectations. Will head back in the future."}
{"text":"This may be one of my new favorites. The interior of this restaurant is wonderful with a very rustic look. The staff was also very friendly and accommodating. The filet was done perfectly and the pretzel bread is very delicious.  Each side order is enough for two.  The dinner for two is a great deal. You will definitely be walking out of this place stuffed with food to go home.  I would recommend this place to anybody who's in the mood for a great meal."}
{"text":"We absolutely love our local steak houses, XO, Hyde Park, and Cabin Club to name a few and have generally had excellent experiences at each of these locations. It is with regret, that I am writing this review as I feel this is an experience that needs to be shared.   An email was sent out to management at the end of June. Here is what was sent to them:  \"Exactly a week ago my wife and I had dinner at your restaurant for the very first time, just wanted to inform you about our experience. My brother and sister in law go your restaurant frequently and have raved about your steak, and fish meals, and happy hour specials. My wife and I decided to get a sitter for the night and try your restaurant. We love the decoration and history behind the building.  We arrived around 6:10pm we were informed that there was an approximately a 45 minute wait for a table, which gave us an opportunity to try out the bar. Before that we noticed there was another set of people checking in behind us. Reasonably, they were told it would be about an hour wait. Upon our surprise, a couple minutes later this same guest returned to the hostess stand and, I am not completely certain what she said, but within moments she was seated outside without a reservation. Confused, we asked the hostess if she knew we didn't mind where we were seated and she replied that they were short staffed with waiters and waitresses. At that point we weren't going to split hairs and let that damper our night. We headed to the bar where we were greeted by, I believe her name was Holly, an excellent bartender! She was fast, personable and friendly. We also noticed she did an excellent job training what appeared to be the new bartender. We did end up waiting over an hour before asking the hostess if our table was ready and she said it would be another 5 minutes or so to get the table ready.  As we were escorted to our table, it was to our unfortunate surprise that we were seated right next to the same woman who cut us in line as she was already finishing up her dinner. Slightly annoyed, but extremely hungry we decided we waited this long and we may as well try the dinner. Within ten minutes of being seated we both ordered steak and my wife ordered I believe the soup of the day, which was some sort of potato soup. Our waiter did not inform us that the kitchen was backed up, we only found out because we overheard the other waitress telling her tables. It was at least another hour before our steaks arrived. My wife asked if the soup was supposed to come out with the steak and was also unfortunately told that he completely forgot to put in the soup order. At that point we were just happy to eat something, finish our meal and be on our way home. The waiter did end up giving us the soup to take home, but we both felt the damage has been done.  I am fairly certain our experience did not warrant a bill of over $125, do you?\"  As a side note, I would have been more flexible with the wait time was on a Friday or during the weekend, but this was on a random Thursday night.   To recap: We were cut in line without explanation, waited over an hour for our table, waited over an hour for our food to arrive, and management was unresponsive after trying to take the right path to alleviate the issues.    To say this dining experience was disappointing is an understatement.  Update: As the dust has settled, we still never received a response from management. If you do have an issue talk to management as trying to settle a dispute via email fell on deaf ears."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. The steak was filled with fat/grizzle. It was dry and overcooked.  I asked for medium and it was charred. The staff is SO rude. The owner Ron, is a complete imbecile. I spoke to him, he began to start yelling loudly, using profanity.  He was yelling in front of other customers! Completely unprofessional. They didn't seem to really care about the customers. They seem to think more about the almighty dollar."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!  That, and I can't believe I waited so long to check this place out. The service was terrific- our server knew her stuff backwards and forewords! Our order was perfect and the presentation was outstanding! I'm a carnivore pure and simple and have lived in Dallas and Atlanta- home to some of the best steakhouses in America and Strip BLOWS them away! Go and enjoy- eat, drink and love all that life has to offer at Strip!"}
{"text":"Birthday dinner(49:(), Ron is a dialed in operator and if you sit where you can see the kitchen it will be no surprise why the steaks are perfect! No sauce needed but are kinda fun to try. Soooo good, Vincent is a great host., nice guy and knows the strip menu inside and out.  Thanks for another fabulous dinner!  Still the best in NEO."}
{"text":"Pretty much the fanciest restaurant I ever been to. Felt like I didn't belong, average Joe like me. Ha! But the waitress treated me like I was at an Applebee's. Guy behind me was loud and talking about the pros and cons of the republican presidential candidates, and the manager never told him to pipe down. A little tricky trying to choke down some lobster cakes with politics in my ears. Gah, can't wait em all I s'pose. Really wished I could've given five stars, because service was fast and steak was stripped and yummy."}
{"text":"Out-of-Towner.  Been a couple years since dining here and had good experiences in the past.  Disappointed on my return.  Great service at the bar for dinner.  The meal (sea bass) was mediocre at best.  Fish placed on top of salad = hot wilted salad. Bottom of bowel swimming with dressing, and fish tasted recently thawed.   I get it... it's a steak restaurant.  Maybe get the fish right... or drop it from the menu.  Recommendation... go for the steak!"}
{"text":"Great meal, outstanding Mac and cheese, filet so tender, and the smore dessert incredible! Wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"We just made our third visit to STRIP on Christmas Eve and we are three for three! :) The staff is amazing and the food is superb!   We always order the dinner for two because we appreciate the price given the choices and portions it comes with. You get your choice of a soup or salad for each of you, two filets, your choice of two sides to share and your choice of a desert to share. Of course we always have to take the desert home! The filets are 6oz, but you can upgrade to a 12oz filet for $14. The filets are always prepared exactly as we've asked and they melt in your mouth - almost literally :)   The pretzel bread is yummy too, especially with the peanut butter butter. One time out of the three times we've been to STRIP, the chef sent out a little something special for us (a sample tasting of chocolate mousse for each of us after we enjoyed our salads and before our meals arrived) and that was a nice touch.   We appreciate the dress code also. You can wear jeans and a nice shirt and feel right at home. There's nothing worse than enjoying a great meal and having to be told you have to wear something that may make you feel uncomfortable.   If you are looking for a romantic/private setting, I would recommend asking for a table upstairs.   Thumbs up to the entire staff at STRIP!! We live in Vermilion and many of our friends have tried talking us into visiting Chez Francois to compare it to STRIP and we just can't bring ourselves to do so. STRIP has delivered a positive experience each and every time!!"}
{"text":"Very good food and atmosphere.  We had the cowboy steak and small filet.  Cooked to requested temp, medium rare and medium- spot on.  There were jam packed when we dined, but the service level was excellent; tipped 22%.    It may be hard to find for the non-west sider but its worth the search.  There are not cert many great options on this side of town for quality dining, so you take what you can get.    Unlike most of the private restaurants out this way, Strip does a quality job, with the right know-how, top of the line ingredients, and a well trained staff.  My only ding is the pricing, but again, they are not in the category of chain eatery garbage.  Pay a fee extra bucks and enjoy the memorable evening."}
{"text":"First visit here.  A little hard to find,  it is set back in a shopping area and I never did see the sign until we were right in front of the building.  Very cozy. Not a very large place.  Server was very knowledgeable and right on mark with all of the items we ordered.  I had the 6 Oz filet,  hubby had the 12 Oz. Side of broccoli was enough for 3-4 people.  Mashed potatoes were probably enough for 3, but had too nub butter, which made them a little runny, but they tasted good. Steak was seasoned and cooked perfectly. Our dinner guests had the strip & pork chop.  Both were delicious and the pork chop was huge! It looked like the Fred Flinstone special!  Dessert was delicious (monkey bread). One complaint I may have is that while our server was informative and attentive,  it seemed to take forever to get our dinner and then dessert. We ended up being there 3 hrs on a slow Thursday night. Plenty of kitchen help there. Not sure what the issue was, but we didn't plan on being there that long.  I would go back, would like to try other menu items.  Huge selection of desserts! Everything sounded amazing! Definately worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Great steak oriented restaurant in an old refurbished barn. Had the grilled Veal chop that came with a side of pierogies! OMG! Service was very good and the wine list was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Service is awesome. Portions are generous. Meals are made to your liking. We like bringing other couples here to dine with us. Will be back!"}
{"text":"In one word.....excellent! From the cocktails to the appetizers and main courses, everything was perfect! Their homemade peanut butter with their pretzel sticks was to die for! Their chicken skewer appetizers was amazing! My wife had the mouthwatering pork chops and I had a tasty steak that melted in my mouth! We were there for my birthday and the cake they brought for the birthday dessert was so big I thought a girl was going to jump out of it!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  Derek and I went here last Sunday night for our anniversary dinner. I would have to agree that the steak, atmosphere, and service were top-notch. The side dishes were okay. But then again, maybe my definition of \"okay\" is someone else's \"amazing.\"  First, the space. It was old-fashioned and modern simultaneously. Very unique. I loved the little area it was tucked away in ... felt like a small town despite being off of Detroit Road in Suburbia, USA.  Our server was knowledgeable and thorough. A tad snarky, though: she called my husband out for \"not listening\" while she was announcing the specials. (To be fair, he WAS being a bit rude by checking the Tigers/Yankees score on his phone, but I'd like to think that I'm the only one irritated by this.)  I ordered a drink that was highly unnecessary, because it didn't really get me buzzed, but just kinda gave me a sugar rush. I forgot the name of it, but it had ginger liqueur, cranberry juice, and lime. Picture a Cosmo with no hard liquor and an undercurrent of ginger. They were out of the 90-minute IPA on draft, so my husband just ordered something out of the bottle.  We decided to get the dinner for two, which consists of 2 six-ounce filets, 2 sides, a soup or salad apiece, and a dessert to share. We ordered the Harvest salads and were very happy with them. The dressing is a little sweet, so be aware -- there's a lot of honey in it. Also, the nut clusters (almonds I think?) seemed to be roasted and coated in a cinnamon-sugar mixture.  The steaks were out of this world. Best I have ever had!  The sides. Okay. We decided to order one \"healthy\" side and one unhealthy side. We got the sauteed spinach, which came with (gag) whole mushrooms). Not my fave. The mac and cheese was the other one. I had such high hopes for it ... but I was not too impressed! First of all, there were way too many breadcrumbs on top. (Or was it parmesan cheese? Either way, too crumby and they weren't baked in enough.) Secondly, the concoction itself was odd. The sauce was waaaay too creamy/cheesy for the size of the pasta, which were basically mini-shells. If that same sauce had been on penne, or bigger shells, or rotini, or something, it would have been much better.  Also, the size of the sides was just obscene. We didn't make a dent in either of them. It was just a waste of food. (We did take some home, but reheated is not the same with spinach or even mac and cheese.)  The dessert (Twizzted) was phenomenal. So odd, but delicious. Cherry twizzler gelato with a hard chocolate shell atop a little chocolate cake with pop rocks around it. Need I say more?  Anyway, I would definitely recommend this place. It is the first steakhouse I've ever been to that has been innovative and modern while simultaneously maintaining traditional aspects of the dining experience. Great for out-of-towners, in-laws, and anyone wanting a great steak in a cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food is very good, service is below par, especially considering price.  The bar area was nice, sat on a couch, however it took 15 minutes to get our drinks after we ordered.   Food order for another table came out, really wasn't that busy.  Our table upstairs was ok, again slow service, plus they were out of two selections we ordered, which just slowed down things more.  The table next to us had some kids, which is just fine (we have kids), but, incredibly to us, the manager offered to distract the kids by turning on the tv and blasting Disney Channel across the floor!  Not sure who the guest were, but they obviously knew the owner (maybe it was the owners family, I don't know)  Don't mind us, the paying folk, but I can stay at home and watch phineus and Ferb with my kids!  What a disappointment"}
{"text":"Strip is the best restaurant in town!  It is my #1 choice for amazing service, food, and atmosphere.    The servers are amazing. They really cater to the customer's needs and make sure everyone's dining experience is special. The food is perfection. I always order the sea bass with Mac 'n' cheese and have never been disappointed.  And don't get me started on the pretzel sticks.... AMAZING!   The ambience is wonderful. Strip always has great music, a lively dining area, and a fantastic layout.  This place is very spacious and comfortable.   If you're looking for a quality restaurant, head to Strip!  But make a reservation first, this place is always booming!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and will continue to come back.  The food is excellent.  The only other steak joint in Cleveland that compares is on the other side of town.  The steaks melt in your mouth.  The sides are served family style and the portions are very big.  They have recently updated their menu and the new options exceeded my expectations, especially the lobster mashed potatoes.    The service is excellent and the servers know the menu inside and out.  They give great suggestions for pairings and menu choices.  I would highly recommend Strip for a birthday, anniversary or any special event."}
{"text":"Place was recommended to me by a friend. Took my girlfriend here for our anniversary and it was amazing. The food was cooked perfect, absolutely delicious. The service was top notch, I've had better, but only at far more expensive restaurants. Our server was a stand-up individual who was on point all night. I would definitely come here again, but because a meal for 2 with run you $150, then I recommend only attending for special occasions...But definitely come here for special occasions, it's perfect.  Side note: it's nearly impossible to find from the road, and not even Google maps tells you where to turn in...But once you find it, its awesome."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to celebrate our \"golden anniversary\" here a few weeks ago, and were very pleased with our meal and the experience.  We sat at an upstairs table and really enjoyed the ambiance and feel of the old, converted Amish barn.  We decided to share their \"Steaks for Two\" dinner special which consists of a pair of 6oz filets, 2 side salads, 2 side dishes and one dessert.  We also had a wonderful bottle of Cab as well.  The meal started off with a basket of piping hot pretzel rolls with your choice of a regular butter or a peanut butter styled butter...both were tasty options and the pretzel rolls were baked perfectly.  My wife ordered the side salad with a house dressing, and i \"upgraded\" to the lobster bisque.  The salad had a nice mix of greens and slices of hard Parmesan cheese on top...quite good!  My bisque was unusual, a fair bit thinner than a typical bisque but loaded with lobster chunks and a very good flavor.  Then came the main dishes...each steak comes with either a butter topper or a side dipping sauce (if you choose).  My wife got the Bearnaise sauce and I selected the horseradish cream sauce...mine was clearly the better of the two, and we scarfed up every last bit of it!  The filets were cooked to the exact temps we ordered, and were juicy and delicious.  Our side dishes included a creamed spinach and also the lobster risotto, but excellent choices and large enough to share with 2-4 other people (I think every table walks out with doggy bags for their leftover sides).  For dessert we decided upon their own version of a S'more...which was quite possibly (no offense to the quality of the steaks) the best part of the meal.  Layers of graham crackers, stacked with the requisite chocolate and marshmallow, with a layer of brownie baked inside.  Holly cow, talk about decadence!!!  I included some pictures for you to drool over as well.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Get reservations.  Eight of my coworkers and I went here to unwind after our work week.  I absolutely loved the place.   The ambiance is unique, a relocated and remodeled old barn. The restaurant features an Open kitchen, nice bar area with a lounge seating area, and sophisticated,  modern decor.    They have a few menu specials which include sides but most do not.   As is typical in a lot of similar restaurants,  the sides are served family style and are said to serve 2. However,  we all shared sides and felt they would more likely serve up to 4 people.    The waitress was amazingly friendly, and she was very timely even considering our party size.   I had a filet,  medium,  and it well-prepared and delicious. In fact every one in my party commented on how great everything was.   If I'm in the area again,  I'm definitely go back."}
{"text":"Tried to make a reservation-had to leave a message. Had to call back after hearing the message only to be greeted by a recording. Finally was able to speak to the host/greeter/whatever that answers the phone at Strip only to be told \"sorry, we are soooo busy you won't ever get seated if added to the list. Rude as fu*k if you ask me and if I could have choked its ass through the phone I would have. Well that's my review-will never be able to comment on the food because I will never call or go here. Didn't want to leave a star but I had to if I wanted to share"}
{"text":"Went here on my birthday. This place is off the chart. Had the prawns, and ribeye with 10 Oz lobster tail. Everything was amazing! I am big advocate of Red steakhouse this is now my new goto steak house."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a few years now and I'm glad we finally got around to going. Friendly, helpful staff and excellent food. Started off with cocktails and had very good tortilla chicken soup. They also brought out pretzel breadsticks with your choice of regular butter or a whipped peanut butter that my girlfriend found odd but I loved. We both had steaks which were perfectly cooked and very flavorful. Even though the sides are noted as being for two we splurged and got a loaded backed potato and pierogis, which we suggested by the waitress as a special. Both were fantastic but were too large to finish as expected. Followed up dinner with a wonderful creme brulee. Definitely enjoyed the experience and the ambiance."}
{"text":"Strip is by far my husband and my favorite restaurant.   This steakhouse is settled in beautiful Avon, in an old barn that has been relocated to its current location. The atmosphere is homey, yet upscale, with artwork hanging that is made by local artists. The owner is also the chef, and is seriously the nicest man.   Out of the 3 different steaks that I have tried, the 'Stripper' is my favorite. The bourbon creamed corn and lobster pasta are delicious side dishes and big enough servings for 2, with leftovers to take home! The last time we were there, our favorite appetizer, the mussels in garlic butter, were no longer on the menu, but the chef made them for us anyway! As for dessert, the crime brûlée is my fave (personally, I would die for it), while, my husband love the Tirasata cake (think Tiramisu and cassata cake).   We have never had a bad meal, a bad drink, OR bad service. Dina is the server that we request when we go, and is the server that we would recommend for anyone. If you want to feel like you are being served by your best friend, who calls you \"love\" the whole time she is serving you, then ask for her.   This is our special occasion place, and we wished it wasn't 2 hours from our home, but it's probably a good thing it IS so far, because we would be broke from eating here so often."}
{"text":"One of the best filets in Cleveland! The gruyère mac & cheese and bourbon creamed corn are guilty splurges so good you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Very good steak in an cool rustic barn setting. Very nice vibe. They do a ton of things extremely well.   This may be more of a concept critique....If you dine downstairs, the kitchen is exposed. Kind of bizarre they allow the cooks in the kitchen to be on their cellphones and so casual (wearing knit winter hats/street clothes/etc) while preparing meals. I just couldn't help but notice due to the open visibility. Wardrobe of staff is similar to that of a Texas Roadhouse, which is not what you would expect with what most perceive as an upscale steakhouse like Strip. At first glance you would think you were looking at a chain restaurants kitchen. Sit upstairs for more of a romantic atmosphere.   The food was prepared very well and service was very, very good. Would definitely recommend and we will be going back. But for those looking for a higher end dining experience, including attention to the finer things and aesthetics, maybe look elsewhere. But all in all, a solid choice if your out in Avon looking for an above average steak."}
{"text":"Strip: Mouthwatering steak, scrumptious side dishes, perfect atmosphere.  Reservations, while not required are definitely suggested for Fridays and Saturdays, dinner is served from 4p-10p, but the bar opens at 3p.  Strip describes its décor as \"primitive elegance\" - it's located inside Olde Avon Village's Ewers Barn which dates back to 1851. Upon entering, you will find a bar located to your left - where you can enjoy a Tickle Me Pink martini (yum!). Upstairs you will find an intimate contemporary dining room. Outside - (which I have yet to enjoy) is a spacious patio complete with waterfall and fire pit.  The \"Dinner for Two\" has been our go-to both times, it comes with two 6 ounce filets, two house salads or soup of the day, two sides, and a dessert - all for $79.  You can get the 12 ounce steak if you wish and any of the salads (all for modest upsize charges).  My personal fave is the Trapped salad (cold lobster salad with cherry tomatoes, carrots, celery, and onion in a mayo-base dressing and layered with fresh guacamole), the 6 ounce filet with Horseradish Cream sauce, and the Gruyère Mac & Cheese as a side.  The menu garners a pretty big selection of \"soups & starters,\" including tator tots (stuffed with bleu cheese and bacon, served with whole grain mustard) and Crab Cakes (three Maryland style cakes with pickled ginger remoulade). When it comes to making selections - you will have plenty of options here at Strip. Even though Strip is a Contemporary Steakhouse - they're also known for their delicious Seafood selections. Not to mention, it's Clam Bake season now and they're running some delicious specials!  Strip is a great experience for a special celebration or a first date (it's fancy but not so fancy that you can't roll in, in some dark jeans and a nice top).  During our last visit our waiter filled us in on the fact that they will be revamping the menu to include some savory Fall dishes - we're looking forward to it and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Strip never disappoints. The atmosphere isn't what you would expect at a steakhouse but I think that's what makes it so unique. The drinks- are amazing and they pour heavy! The pretzel bread is delicious with the peanut butter-butter ( yes you read that right ).  I've only ever had filet the four or gives times I've been but it's always been cooked to perfection. I love that you can choose sauces or butters for your steak as well. The sides are very gracious on serving size my personal favorite is the bourbon creamed corn ( OMMMGGGG ). My husbands is the Mac and cheese we always bring home leftovers and heat them up and they are just as good the next day. The raspberry cobbler dessert is another one of our favorites with the ice cream. The service is always top notch and I like that it's not stuffy for being a very good steakhouse. The area it's located in, is also adorable! Check it out! Also, my parents came with us once and one had a salmon dish and one had the lamb and loved both!"}
{"text":"The building is great!  We had a party of 15 and a single server took care of all of us, which was impressive.   I actually wasn't that impressed by my steak. Perhaps it was because I just got a standard filet. Perhaps it was because it was cool by the time I ate it, but it didn't seem to be anything special. I did enjoy the bourbon creamed corn.  The mixed drinks were also fairly weak.   I'm glad my company paid for dinner. If it had been on my own dime I would probably downgrade to a 2 star rating."}
{"text":"Went there Thursday night with guests who had dietary requirements. What a poor experience . Besides the tattooed waitress telling us \"chef\" won't change anything(really broccoli instead of potatoes!)one of my guests caught her talking about them when he went to the bathroom. My favorite place is no longer and I will cease going there all over service . Didn't matter my food was excellent. ........"}
{"text":"Dinner at Strip last evening was superb!! Contrary to several reviewers, we had polite, attentive and professional service throughout our meal. Our table's main courses (five dinners) were each excellent, prepared as requested. The house salads were dressed with a sublime vinaigrette. The sides were solid yet, I thought, a bit whimsical. The pretzel breadsticks (with homemade peanut \"butter\") were stars in their own right and the two desserts we shared were first-rate. All in all, this is our new brf.  It's too pricey for our regular budget, but we'll use it for many of our \"special\" dinners (and plan to give out a gift certificate to friends that we \"owe\".)"}
{"text":"Never tried Strip before so we stopped in for Dinner on Friday night no reservations, they said 30 mins to be seated, but we didn't wait that long they seated us on the lovely patio section. The wine selection is pretty good, the building itself is a classic barn from Avon long ago remade into a intimate restaurant. The lobster ravioli was delicious we also had the drunken pig pork chop it was tasty the mashed potatoes were ok nothing special. I hear good things about the happy hour here. Definitely will be back in the future. The staff was more then attentive and pleasant. Great atmosphere"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting and everything was great except the steak.  I ordered a strip  medium and it was  just dry with a bad flavor.  The best way I could explain it is it's the way a frozen steak taste sometimes when you cook it.  I'm not saying this is what they do here but I was pretty bummed about the steak.  Everything else was great though."}
{"text":"Strip is our favorite restaurant - but we only save it for special occasions. I've been to Red and Morton's, and Strip is still my top recommendation for steak houses in the area. Can't go wrong with any of the cuts or sides. Service is also always exceptional. Had Mike this past time, and he might have been one of the greatest servers I have ever had in my entire dining experience. He explained everything thoroughly, made sure we were comfortable with every opportunity, and was just pleasant and engaging. Really made the whole experience spectacular. Make sure to ask for Mike!"}
{"text":"Strip is one of my favorite restaurants for a special occasion.    2 suggestions:  1) Get the steak and 2) Know that the sides feed 3 - 4 people."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Avon or on the far west side!  Cool ambiance inside, we dined on the second floor, which was neat.  Everything we had was delicious!  Good special occasion or date night spot.  Portions were nice."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner after my brother's graduation. The atmosphere is wonderful. They have a nice bar downstairs and a relaxing, intimate area upstairs away from the  crowd below. The food was out of this world. The steak was  the best I've ever had and the guyere mac and cheese was big enough to feed two people. Great place for date night or a Girl's night out."}
{"text":"I count my meal as one of the very best I've ever eaten. It began with a blueberry Cucumber martini. The flavors for subtle it wasn't too sweet it wasn't too overpowering. Then came the pretzel bread and the peanut butter.  Heaven. My steak, I got a Jake's steak, was too well done when it came out. I said something to the bartender comma and almost immediately one came out that was perfectly cooked. There was a long wait so I ate at the bar. I had the lobster pasta as a side and again it was perfection. It was a bit pricey....for a drink, a steak and a side it was $50 for just me, but I think it was worth every penny."}
{"text":"This is the most playful steakhouse you will ever eat at.    The words \"playful steakhouse\" may seem a little odd, but when you think about it, most steakhouses have all the creativity of the post office.  You scan their menus to see what they have; \"WE HAVE BEEF!\" they say, pointing proudly to their hangers of well-aged meat.    \"That's cool,\" say I.  \"So what do you do with the beef?\"   \"WE COOK IT,\" they say, looking vaguely baffled, as if merely procuring a twenty-dollar piece of cow and searing it on a grill should be enough.    \"No, I mean, what do you do with sauces?  Side dishes?  Rub-ins and spices?\"   \"WE OFFER LOADED BAKED POTATO!\" they reply, as if the loaded baked potato is some new-fangled craze that they've only recently become aware of.  \"ALSO, BREAD.  WITH BUTTER.  BUT NOT OLIVE OIL, THAT'S CRAZY, \"  When the Big Advance in steak technology is, in fact, sprinkling bleu cheese on it, you know we're in trouble.    But it's true; steakeries tend to be the backwaters of dining experiences, stuffy old places that are so busy talking about the quality of their meat, they've never once investigated anything else they could do with it.  Kind of like John Holmes, but older and deader.  Not so at Strip!  Strip does kooky things, and not just with beef.  They have a peanut-butter-and-Captain-Crunch-encrusted chicken, which they top with pepper jelly.  They call it the PB&J.    They also have a brownie hamburger - just roll that around on your tongue, BROWNIE HAMBURGER - and donut fries that consists of brownie \"burgers\" on poundcake \"buns\" with mint \"lettuce\" and thin-sliced strawberry \"tomatoes.\" The ketchup is actually raspberry sauce, and mustard (if I recall correctly) is mango sauce.    So they're a little nuts there.  And if you want a little more to your Stripper meat, which is excellent, they offer all kinds of sauces (mercifully automatically on the side) and flavored butters to drizzle, as well as upscale side dishes like tater tots stuffed with bleu cheese and bacon.    The servers are garrulous, yet informative, willing to go to great lengths to keep you happy, and the atmosphere is noisy come the evening - it used to be a barn, and has some of the echoiness of rafters in the place, but it's very clean and nice-looking.    In short, if you want to fuse a mildly adventurous dining experience with the joy of dead cow, Strip can't be beat in Cleveland.  Highly, highly recommended."}
{"text":"I' ve never before written a restaurant review but this was so bad I had to create a Yelp ID and do it.  I have been traveling to the Avon area for 7+ years, and hadn't been to this restaurant although I'd heard good thing about it.  A co-worker and I went last night and it was not a good experience.  First of all we were seated at a table next to a wall mounted fireplace picture / heater, which was pouring heat onto my seat,with cold air coming from the other side.  I asked the waitress if she could reseat us but she said she would go in back and have them turn it off, it never happened so eventually I got up and turned it off myself (switch was on unit).  There were plenty of open tables around us all night so no reason not to move us.  Then we got our appetizers, the stuffed peppers and scallops.  They were OK but nothing to write home about.  Stuffed pepper was way to sweet and scallops slightly overcooked but large.  We ordered the filet dinner for 2, with sides of spinach and broccoli and 2 salads.  The salads had so much dressing on them we could not eat them, we mentioned this to our waitress but did not return them (I recommend you order dressing on the side).    Then the entre came.  both steaks were a nice cut, and done medium rare as we had requested.  Unfortunately the steake arrived so cold that the garlic butter put on top of it would not even melt, lukewarm at best.  We started eating them and both looked at each other due to the off flavor we tasted.  Turned out the colored \"sauce\" on the plate under the steaks that was very unpleasantly sweet was simple syrup with food coloring...yecchh!!  Who wants syrup with their steak!!  It was terrible as was the spinach side we ordered (way too sweet).  We didn't send the steaks back as we didn't want to incur extra cost for them, but we did ask for new plates.  By then my steak was so cold I sent it back to be cooked more so it would at least be warm.  In retrospect we should have sent it all back.  The waitress was very apologetic, saying they were \"trying\" the syrup idea and had several complaints (it was not on the menu that this would be there).   By now she was asking what she could do to make our experience better, and my co-worker ordered a glass of wine (we previously had a  bottle) since it was now taking so long.  When the check came nothing was comped, including the glass of  wine, so we asked to speak with the manager.  She left and came, saying the owner didn't want to stop over, but she gave us a $20 gift certificate and no bill deductions.  REALLY!!!  By then there was only 1-2 other tables of people in the restaurant and they were starting to shut things down.  We paid our bill, left the gift certificate with it, and will NEVER go back!!!  If an owner doesn't care enough about a diners bad experience to talk to them and try to make it better, they don't deserve to be in business."}
{"text":"Traveling from out of town and heard this place was good so I thought I'd check it out. The name of the place still had me questioning whether it was males-only and the big wooden doors still had me wondering as I stepped in. Luckily, it was a restaurant. Shew! No awkward moment to talk about!  Since it was just me, I ate at the bar. The bartender was friendly, knew a lot about the area and the service and her drinks were great! I highly recommend  the 6oz petite steak, it was awesome! I also ordered the sauteed spinach - also cooked just right. I think the only thing I'd wish for is that they served single servings of sides - all of them are served for a party of 2 so I had to waste half of it."}
{"text":"Just alittle above average.  Really didn't do anything for me.Didnt understand the pretzel sticks for your bread. Food was just ok."}
{"text":"This is a great place to take a date or wife for a night out. Pair this a great drink selection and you are sure to impress. The bar tenders and wait staff are extremely good at what they do. Their knowledge of food selection is impressive. Definitely a must date night."}
{"text":"3 STRIKES AND STRIP IS OUT  After going to the Strip for several years and having some good experiences, I have unfortunately had one too many bad experiences. The final straw came about a month ago while having dinner there with a friend. Ordered the Cowboy Rib Eye - Medium. After attempting to cut into it I found it to be too fatty and too gristly. I brought this to the attention of our server, who is also a manager, and he asked, \"you don't like the gristle, that's my favorite part.\" View the photo attached - does this look like a good cut of meat? Would you eat it?   Near the end of dinner he asked if I wanted a doggy bag for the ¾ of steak I had remaining on my plate - I told him no, it was not a good cut of meat and I wouldn't eat it at home either. So he took it away.   Never an apology or an offer for another steak or was anything taken off the bill. For us, this was the last trip to Strip."}
{"text":"Got the special bone-in Australian steak. 2lbs. Yes, please! Sigh, was disappointing. For $75, about 2/3 of it was edible. The rest was fat. Was pretty good and had just above average tenderness. I've had much better Australian steaks at XO in Cleveland. Ruth's Chris has better steaks, and they're a chain restaurant. The gruyere mac and cheese was a huge letdown. Not too cheesy and looked like it came from a powdered mix. The filet steaks we all got were about 7/10, compared to XO. And XO has gone downhill in the last few years. Great ambiance and uniqueness with the barn, and great seating outside. However, they need to invest some money in new chairs! My butt still hurt the next day from sitting in those chairs. I'm not a large person by any means (5'9\", 190lbs), and I'm muscular, but the chairs! Oh my, they chairs!!!! They are basically a wood frame with a leather top that you sink down into. And I mean DOWN. At first it feels cool. Then after 1/2 hr, my bones are screaming \"Let me out Get up!\" Made the dining experience unbearable. Will NOT return till they have better chairs! Steaks are not that good that it will override the other problems this restaurant has."}
{"text":"Had dinner for my husband's birthday. While I did not take pictures of anything I must say the we have never ever been disappointed in ANYTHING we've had here. It is on the pricy side but when you taste the food, you'll know why!"}
{"text":"I have dined here twice and both times were phenomenal! The dinner for two is perfectly portioned. I recommend the lobster pasta, scalloped potatoes and s'mores for dessert. The bar makes amazing cocktails, and the atmosphere is stunning. Highly recommended for a fine dining experience."}
{"text":"Cannot overstate what a lovely evening my husband and I had! We popped in without a reservation on a Saturday night around 8:30. Decided to have a drink at the bar while we waited. Ended up ordering dinner there as it was so cozy and the service was great. Food was delicious and the steak was cooked to perfection. Warm pretzel breadsticks and three different butter spreads were divine! Really had a lovely evening and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very expensive- came for a special occasion but I do not eat steak- so I cannot judge that. My husband said his steak was very very good, but was too small. I ordered a chicken and pasta dish- chicken was tempura and decent. The pasta was supposed to have vegetables and mushrooms removed but did not. Kinda disappointed. I will say that the Guyere Mac and Cheese was hands down the best mac n cheese I've ever eaten. I could eat that and the pretzel bread as my whole meal. Overall it was an expensive night but I left with a half full belly. Ambience is interesting- I couldn't decide what it was trying to be, and there were several items on the menu that were no longer being served (i.e. The paprikash risotto balls. ). Our waitress was very good and attentive. I probably would not come again unless I was again invited for a special event."}
{"text":"The BF and I chose Strip as the location for our 3rd Annual pre-Thanksgiving date night!  This tradition started in 2008 when he was living in Florida and I was living in Chicago, and we wouldn't be celebrating the holidays together.  We decided we would treat ourselves to an extravagant date night each year, throwing budgets and diets out the window, so we had a way to celebrate together.  Even though we both live in Cleveland now, we decided to keep the tradition alive :-)  So Tuesday night we got all gussied up and headed 'round the corner to Strip.  I would have written this review earlier, but I just woke up from the food coma this meal put me in!     Now I love me a good steakhouse, but I hate how pretentious and old fashioned they can be.  The minute I stepped into Strip I was immediately won over by the ambiance.  The rustic barn structure combined with modern decor and table settings works wonderfully!  No stuffiness here! We settled into our nice table on the second floor, ordered a very tasty but not wallet breaking bottle of Petite Syrah, and perused the menu.  We had decided on the stuffed tater tots for an appetizer, but once our server mentioned the appetizer special was homemade short rib pierogies, we quickly changed our mind!  And so glad we did be cause they were a.maz.ing!  OMG,  the best pierogie I have ever had!  And the biggest!  Three huge pierogies served with caramelized onions and a dollop of sour cream.  We both had one, with the intent on leaving the third on the plate because we didn't want to fill up too much.  Yeah right!  That last pierogie didn't stand a chance!  Luckily we are mature adults and didn't fight over it.  We split it in half :-) I ordered the 6 oz filet and my BF got the cowboy cut ribeye.  Both steaks were cooked to perfection.  When you order you able to chose from a list of compound butters or sauces to accompany your steak.  The BF went with a simple garlic butter and I chose a blue cheese vin blanc sauce which was wonderful.  Not too bold, just the right amount of flavor to enhance the beautiful piece of meat.  For sides we agreed we would each pick one and share it.  Let me just say, if there was an award for best side dish picker, I would so win!  I chose the lobster pasta; penne and tasty chunks of lobster tossed in a light tomato cream sauce.  Need I say more?  The BF channeled his inner Popeye and picked spinach for his side.  Really dude? Whatever. And just as I suspected it would be, the spinach was pretty underwhelming.  Not bad, not good...just nothing special.  Even the BF agreed he would go with one of the other sides next time. Dessert was declined because we were so full, but promised we would leave room next time because the options looked so tasty! Before the check came we played the \"home much do you think it is?\" game and were shocked when we saw the actual total.  We had both guessed the bill would be about $30 more than it actually was!  Nice! So forget the Cabin Club and definitely forget Hyde Park...Strip has now taken the title as the best steakhouse on the West side!  A tip for those on a budget: Strip offers a nice dinner for two, consisting of 2 6oz filets, 2 salads or soup, 2 sides and 1 dessert for only $80!"}
{"text":"The place meet our expectations.  Big Daddy porterhouse was cooked to order and the cream corn side was excellent.  Will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Very nice place to splurge for special occasions. I reserved a table for New Years Eve with family and friends. The place is small but very well decorated and feels bigger than it is. The food was delicious. The side portions are huge! Some portions are too big for one person as well. I especially loved my martini. The very berry martini. The staff was very pleasant. I would recommend Strip to anyone! Go....spend a lot...enjoy a full belly!"}
{"text":"The steak was amazing  !!  Atmosphere  was excellent  only 4 stars because I thought it was a little overrated"}
{"text":"This is a great place!  It's in an old barn that was transcended into a lay back rustic lounge.  Music is always playing at the perfect sound level.  The servers are very attentive and polite.  Our meal was one of the best, we had a filet and a cowboy steak and they were made to perfection.  The only thing is they are pricey we spent $115 for 2 beers, 2 salads, 6 oz filet, 22 oz strip with bone, shared a baked potato and desert.  I feel it's about 25% on the high side.  Hopefully Avon can support this very nice steak house.  I will definitely return just not as often as I would like to."}
{"text":"I've wanted to treat myself to a nice dinner, so I figured my past birthday was the perfect opportunity to do so. The food and service was outstanding, so much so that I would have given it five stars had our seating arrangement been different.   Both my boyfriend and my steaks were cooked perfectly, and the sides tasty and plentiful in size (garlic mashed redskins were phenom). At the end they surprised us with a whole cake for my birthday which seemed to be home-made. It was such a nice surprise and a kind gesture to top off my celebratory dinner.   The problem that totally put a damper on everything was that we were sat at a hightop, two-top table at the bar. When I called for my reservation, I requested a booth but was told that one wouldn't be available until 8:30 pm which was too late for me. I thought to myself, \"I'll take the hightop at the  bar...how bad could it be?\". Well, it was bad. So bad in fact that three different couples who passed us, or awkwardly stood touching our table while in the bar area apologized for intruding due to lack of space or mentioned the awkwardness of our tables's location. The table was also so small that as the food came up there wasn't any room to place any more plates down so I ended up immediately consolidating items on one plate (quickly shoving my steak on my salad plate, etc) while the server nervously and awkwardly stood there waiting for me to hand him the empty plate because there was nowhere to fit it.   Phew...sorry. That was a lot of talk about a table, but if the owners are listening: abolish that table, or remove the seats and make it a table for people to mingle on as part of the bar. It has no place being sat for a dinner party, and really put a damper on our experience. Secondly, only in my opinion, a suggestion on making better use of the space needs to be revisited: there was a nice seating area with couches that took up most of the main dining room, yet there was two people talking and drinking (not eating) while my boyfriend and I were crunched in the middle of the bar area. The coffee table and couches could be removed and two comfortable four tops could have been placed there.  All in all, a great place for a special occasion, but make sure to request a table with ample room!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding?  This place is one of my favorites!!!  The old barn structure has been relocated from middle Ohio.  It makes the whole experience very unique and memorable.  However, the casual \"barn\" exterior is completly trumped by the elegant interior table setup and design.  We have been twice now and both times have been over-impressed with the quality of our meals.  If you're one who enjoys a great steak, don't hold back... savor the Ribeye!"}
{"text":"The hostess stand is always fumbling around and completely confused. If you're lucky enough actually get through to them you're then told \"we need this table back in exactly two hours.\" Keep in mind this is only for 3 people and the restaurant was dead. The bar tables are always \"reserved\" but there's never anyone seated there. I was (past tense) a regular but no more. Other than the bartender who's awesome the hostess stand is insulting and kills the rest of the experience."}
{"text":"From start to finish... our dinner was amazing.  I had they filet, which was cooked just to my liking.  Our sides were the Risotto, Mac & Cheese, and Mashed Potatoes.  All were FANTASTIC.  My boyfriend was the only one in our party who didn't go for the cow.  Instead, he ordered the pork tenderloin.  I had a sample of that.. and it was also super good.  Will be going back for more for sure!  The only complaint was the dish the soups are served in is a bit awkward.  It's like more like something you would serve soup from.. not eat out of.  The only way to get the last third of the soup out is to either pick it up and drink it.. or tilt the thing to the side.  Other than that.  ZERO complaints!"}
{"text":"Excellent Service, Food, and Atmosphere!!!   I'm actually surprised that I am only the 4th to review Strip. I have been there 3 times now and every time the Food and Service have been superb. Strip is a little pricey, but well worth it.   Every time I went I got a steak, I recommend the Stripper and The Barrel Cut Fillet. Also, The Bread-sticks they give you are amazing, they basically pretzel sticks, which are awesome!!! Trust me they are great!!!   The sides are also great, try the Gruyere Mac and Cheese, Lobster Pasta, Risotto of The Day, and Chef's vegetables. In addition, they give you sauces and flavored butter to compliment your steaks. The Horseradish and Blue Cheese Sauces are excellent.   I took my parents for there 35th Anniversary to Strip and my Father who hates all restaurants, just the way he his, could not even find a reason to complain and is already talking about going back.   Try Strip!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the setting.  I got the special to go.  Braised short ribs.  Didn't like it at all!  The veggies were alright.  Pissed me off that it was $40 and I didn't like it.  It was a nice experience sitting in the bar though."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. Given the price point, though, I expected more refined service from everyone (the hostesses to the server). Don't hand me my steak knife. Make sure I have a glass of wine when my steak is served. Show some level of personality as a server. Serve the right dishes to the right people. It was also just weird that there were 5 high school aged hostesses just hanging out behind the front stand. Overall, we probably won't be back simply due to the mismatch between the price point and the level of service."}
{"text":"So good that a week later my husband and I have been saying \"remember that steak at Strip?\" It was so good\". We chose to go because it was our one year anniversary and we got married in the Clifton Barn located behind it. Our server Sara was the best. The food was amazing (we got the meal for 2 and it was a great deal and so much food it was nuts)   Great atmosphere, I have been recommending it to everyone and can't wait to go back! Literally the only steakhouse I think I have ever said that about, ever."}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience with one of the best services from the staff. We enjoyed the special watermelon salad and seasonal beers with our steak dinner. The desserts were out of this world. We had the raspberry cobbler that was absolutely delicious. The sides serve at least 3 to 4 people. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"My parents wanted to go to Outback Steakhouse and I talked them into this - thank goodness. What a great Avon, Ohio restaurant. I love the shopping square and Strip just stood out. -- The decor and ambiance is really nice. Good for a romantic dinner although a bit too dark, more light would be good (although the bill comes with a light). -- The hostess that greeted us was very friendly and they accommodated a table for 7 (incl 2 kids) nicely. Our server was very friendly and attentive. She articulated the menu and specials nicely and offered great service. She also accomodated my kids nicely.    The beef was very good. The sweet potato fries were awesome. I also liked the Lobster Salad and Macaroni and Cheese.  They didn't add automatic gratuity even with a party of 7 which I find amazing. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"Excellent, everything about this place is awesome. The ambiance is fantastic, service is exceptional and the food, AMAZING!! the Lobster Bisque is quite possibly the best ever (Tree House Bisque) and sides, I cannot say enough about. Steaks, perfection, cooked and flavored to perfection. If I could afford it, I'd eat here once a week!"}
{"text":"What a great place! You walk into an old barn to encounter a very modern foyer, frosted glass doors and neon lighting. Pass through this and voilà you're back in an old barn, very nice.  The food was excellent I can't remember eating a more  flavorful steak, ever. The sides are well prepared and huge. The menu says for two but I think four people could easily split the sides, and yes the lobster bisque is as incredible as advertised. The price is high but the quality is exceptional. For the price I would have liked a little better more attentive service but the quality of the food puts the place firmly in five star territory."}
{"text":"I have dined here once after hearing good things about the food and the Strip lived up to what I heard. Meal was fantastic and service was great. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and had a wonderful evening. Greeted warmly by the staff and Holly was our server. She treated us very well and described the specials well. Love the Filet with sides of a loaded baked and creamed corn. We enjoyed every bite."}
{"text":"Location Note: Strip can be a bit tricky to find as it's located off of the main road and there are no frontage signs to let you know where it is. Look for the sign at the intersection of Detroit and Hale that reads \"The Shoppes of Olde Avon Village\" and turn into the drive. Strip is down the hill and to the left.  We choose a different restaurant each year at which to celebrate our wedding anniversary. This year, as you've probably surmised, we chose Strip. I had a hankerin' for a piece of meat and the menu seemed to offer just enough variation for even those not into cow.  First, the venue. Strip is essentially a giant barn that's been repurposed into a restaurant. There's a downstairs area with bench and table seating, a bar for lounging and an upstairs mezzanine that overlooks the downstairs. A giant steel mobile hangs over the center of the space, a set of bull horns on the wall complete with bras dangling precariously from the ends, and dim lighting is the order of the day. I'd say it's got sort of a swanky, upscale casual vibe to it. Not too uptight not too Coyote Ugly.  Strip is all about the steak and it's their showcase menu item. They offer only USDA prime grade beef that's aged 21 days. The steaks range in price from $28 to $39 for a 24oz porterhouse monster. There's also a nice selection of seafood, chops and salads making it a menu with something for just about everyone.  Our server, Sarah, was absolutely amazing and a prime example of what's in terribly short supply within the service industry. This girl knew the menu backwards and forwards. She was up on every beer I asked her about. And she wasn't just some automaton reciting some script she had dutifully memorized as part of her training. It flowed off her tongue effortlessly and every interaction felt as natural as a friendly conversation. She should be given a raise immediately.  To start, we opted for the Tater Tots. While not what you'd expect with a name like this, they were delicious. More croquette than tot, the quartet of Panko-breaded beauties came with a side of herbed cream sauce for dipping and some blue cheese crumbles. Crispy, golden brown outside and smooth, creamy potato insides, the bacon and blue cheese made these into mini loaded baked potatoes.  Every meal comes with complimentary soft pretzel sticks served with butter and peanut butter butter. Don't knock it 'til you've tried it. The smooth, whipped nutty spread is amazing on the buttery soft pretzels.   For my pre-dinner salad I chose the spinach salad. Baby spinach, sugar walnuts, bacon pieces, and tomato wedges, dressed with a warm bacon vinaigrette. I found this to be a slight misstep. The spinach was a bit overdressed and the large tomato wedges were clunky. I did, however, love the crispy bacon and sugary walnuts.  My wife had the butternut squash soup and while well-seasoned and tasty I found it to be very thick, more puree than soup. Still, it was very smooth and full of rich buttery goodness.  For entrees, I had to go with a steak. Anything else felt like it would just be wrong. My selection, the 10oz center-cut ribeye called the Boilermaker. All of their steaks come with your choice of either a compound butter or a sauce. I went with the jalapeno and cilantro butter and wasn't disappointed. The steak was cooked a perfect medium, was nearly so tender I didn't need a knife, and seasoned with a deft hand. This is what I want when I go out for steak.  I also ordered a side of Milburg Scalloped Potatoes. Comfort food, through and through. Tender sliced potatoes covered in what looked like a pound of cheese. Be careful, this was a large serving. Delicious. Need I say more?  My wife had the Skinny Linguini - house-made garlic parsley linguini, butter roasted vegetable medley with morsels of shrimp, served with a 6 oz. cold water lobster tail, garlic crostini, and seasonal herbs. This dish was enormous, probably enough to feed a family of four. I didn't care for it but she thought it was pretty good. The lobster tail was tender and sweet but the pasta and veggies just felt lackluster.  I'll admit it, I'm a bit pickier when it comes to selecting our anniversary dinner spots and, correspondingly more stringent on my reviews of such places. I just go in expecting more. That being said, Strip didn't disappoint. A unique, classy atmosphere, service that was among the best I've experienced in years, and delicious food that left us stuffed to the gills. We'll definitely remember our visit for years to come."}
{"text":"Strip maybe a transplanted Michigan barn in Avon, but step inside and you will discover a multi-tiered schick modernist eatery. My visit of Strip was for my 5th year wedding anniversary which I mentioned while making the reservation via Opentable via Yelp.   I am not one to casually give a 5 star to an establishment, but 'Strip' really did outshine in every aspect of our visit - ambiance, service, food, and experience.  The ambiance is one of casual, quaint, somewhat darker & formal feel especially in the upper level.  The lower level has a more informal feel with a small bar.  Given the historic architecture of it being a barn,  don't expect it to be naturally lit nor many windows.  What Strip misses out in the natural lighting it does make up in the modernist and airy interior decor.  One can tell, Strip's interior decoration works around the barn rather than hide it.  The service for my visit was of superior quality.  We walked in to be greeted by 3 lovely hostesses one of whom was prompt to greet us with a \"Happy Anniversary\" greeting.  This told me that they are attentive to the reservation notes customers put in.  This is great in my opinion.   We were waited upon by Amanda, a very attentive, prompt, and very courteous member of wait staff.  She took her time in taking us through their menu, and items not on their menu as well as their specials.   In each description of items - she was enthusiastic and I could tell she really knew each dish well.  She helped us pick just the right items per our wants.  Frankly, much because of Amanda, we felt our dinner choices were just right to what we wanted.  This is the mark of an A+ service.  For those who have the unfortunate experience with service, ask for Amanda upon arrival & I am also told the management is now very attentive to customer feedback around their service.  The food - the steak were the highlight of Strip, and they absolutely blow your taste-buds.  Even when cooked medium-well, my steak came with the perfect portion of moist & lightest pink in the center.  I chose my steak with Chipotle Lime butter.  We had Lobster Pasta & Edamame Succotash - Chef Dano's signature take on this dish.  We finished with banana-chocolate Trifle.   Let me say that every single dish came with mouthwatering taste and left me wanting more.   I had their Five-O drink.  This is a not-sweet-not-bitter elixir that goes down easy.  Our experience couldn't be better.  We will surely return.  Thank you Strip for making our visit special."}
{"text":"Beware of anything but steak options. My wife ordered the sea bass which was incredibly disappointing; rubbery, overcooked and unappealing to the eye. The fish was almost certainly frozen prior to the kitchen's massacre of it. I ordered the double pork chop, which had limited flavor and overall was a disappointment as well. But for what it is worth, the complimentary pretzel bread is pretty good.   To Strip's credit, the manager did her best to make up for the situation. Not sure it was enough to get us back in the door with so many other good options nearby."}
{"text":"Excellent meal. The steaks were cooked perfectly. Well worth the price. Our server Deena was fantastic. Very personable but still efficient. Try the blue cheese and bacon stuffed tatter tots. They are phenomenal!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had the dinner for two. As others have said, the lobster bisque was exceptional--easily the best I've ever had. And I cannot recall ever tasting steak with so much flavor on its own. I did not care for the peppercorn sauce but it did not matter--the steak was perfect. Finally, the creme brulé, which so many places get wrong, was exactly right.  And all of this was served to us by a knowledgeable, helpful, and attentive waitress.   The meal was costly, but unlike even more expensive steakhouses in Cleveland (I'm looking at you Red); it was worth every penny."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I found this to be a rather disappointing meal. I ordered the 6oz \"barrel-cut\" filet rare, specifically cold in the center. It came out on the upper end of rare, closer to medium rare and was extremely oversalted. I had to scrape off the char since it was so salty. I'm sure part of the problem was how thin the filet was, but they should know better.  Maybe my expectations are too high since my usual steakhouse is Mastro's in Los Angeles or my home, which I can do on part with Mastro's, but at $29 for 6oz, this place isn't cheap either.  On the plus side, the pretzel bread sticks were really good, albeit a bit greasy."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere with food to match!  When you first see the place, you think dirty strip club. With the name, it being in a barn, and the exterior... It makes you think for a second. But then you remember it is in Avon and you see the fleet of high end German autos out front. Not a \"strip\" club....   Upon entering the building you immediately see what a cool place this is. Imagine a barn with Michael Symon-esq ambiance.  Very trendy but down to earth with all the small touches only a barn can bring.   For starters we were served the hot pretzel sticks. As I am a huge pretzel guy, this made my night. Homemade peanut butter too. The drink menu was good but I did not get anything cool.   Our app was the lavender infused scallops. Very tasty, I was getting a lot more garlic than lavender but the scallops were seared perfectly.   My entree was the Catch of the Day, panko crusted Halibut with pumpkin and sweet tater linguini. It was awesome, great mix of textures and flavors.  The fish was buttery and cooked just right, none of that rubbery over-cooked nonsense here. The sauce was savory and made the duller pumpkin flavors just right.   I have recently become a creme brûlée fan and tonight i indulged in a little. It was cooked perfect, and the vanilla bean bottom was awesome. If it wasn't such a nice place i was about to run my finger along the base of the bowl to get all of that delicious vanilla bean.   Seriously cant complain here. It was great, a little pricy for sure but worth it. I will be back for drinks and maybe a late night dessert in the future. If you are in the area I would really recommend the Strip!"}
{"text":"Joe was amazing! It was my birthday! I do wish they had music at the outdoor patio.  Food was outstanding. So glad we went there!"}
{"text":"We have been searching for a restaurant to host our son and his fiancée's rehearsal dinner.  So, we have been visiting for dinner our short list.  Well, to make a long story short, the four of us had dinner at Strip the other night and my wife put the deposit down the next day.  To start, because we were all coming from different commitments we met on the outdoor patio for drinks.  The patio is incredible having both hard-back chairs and tables, and stuffed furniture and coffee tables.  A very intimate setting that also has subtly illuminated landscaping with a very artistic water feature.  Once we moved inside and settled in at our table our server was prompt, polite, personable and informed.  I was really in the mood for red meat and so ordered the Boilermaker (12oz Ribeye Filet) with the horseradish cream sauce, and the garlic smashed potatoes.  After the first taste, I'm suprised I didn't just stuff my cheeks with the rest of the meal so as to enjoy it over the next several days!  It WAS that good!  And, if there was anything to disappoint, it was that the four of us must have been in the same mood because with the exception of the sides, we all ordered the Boilermaker.  Hence, I did not get to sample other delights on the same night.  But, everyone in our party thoroughly enjoyed their meals having been prepared to the perfection of our individual tastes.  Sorry, but no room for dessert!  I would highly recommend the Strip Steakhouse for a fine dining experience.  The atmosphere is casual in a rustic, exposed beam barn.  We ate in the loft, which was really cool.  The restaurant can be difficult to see from the street (Detroit Ave), because it is set back from the road amongst some large trees and having shared parking with several other businesses.  In a scene right out of that Alstate commercial... When my GPS said to turn right, I pulled on the steering wheel and was in the driveway - Whew!  I look forward not only to having the rehersal dinner there (actually in an adjacent buliding), but hope to go back many more times!  Oh yeah, I'm looking forward to the wedding, as well!"}
{"text":"Went here last night and it was GREAT- wanted to have a special night and was willing to spend the extra $$$.  We never go to Avon, but heard good things about this place and decided to check it out, and venture out to the far Westside burbs.  Strip is celebrating its 3rd Bday- it is in a historic barn that was shipped in from the Columbus, OH area.  We were sat at a corner table on the 2nd floor.  The décor is strangely errie but fun at the same time.  Love the striptease theme!!!  Carol our server was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. She highlighted that Strip was 1 0f 3 restaurants in Cleveland that is a Gold Certified Black Angus restaurant. It serves only prime-graded beef aged over 21 days for its superior flavor and tenderness.   They are still serving their summer menu, which was a bit of a surprise.  We started with \"The Temptation\" ($16) 2- 1/2 lobster tails battered and deep fried- served with drawn butter & a honey mustard wine dip.  I would have preferred less batter but they were tasty.  We split a house salad that had delicious vinaigrette that was not too heavy.  We ordered 2 entrees- Bluewater Toothfish- the sea bass ($28) & the cut of the day which was a 32oz bone in Rib-eye ($60) served on a cedar plank.  Mac'n'cheese side and steak fries.  Dessert- the Twisted, which was cherry gelato with a chocolate hard shell, a white chocolate type sauce and plain pop rocks- yes pop rocks crunched in your mouth, 2nd dessert was a combination tiramisu and cassata cake- which was $10.  Looking forward to the Fall menu coming out soon.  Will go back with a group because there are so many yummy things to share!"}
{"text":"I had the special steak, a bone in wagyu.  Best steak I've ever had.  Huge fan of the homemade pretzel bread & peanut butter spread.  Nice little outdoor space too on a nice night."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for our anniversary.  We were seated promptly as per our reservation and shown to a great table where we weren't sitting on top of other guests.  The converted barn atmosphere is amazing.  We ordered drinks, had the crabby pants appetizer (which was very good).  We had steaks for dinner that were prepared perfectly.  We finished the evening splitting a delicious creme brûlée.  We travelled 45 mins to get here and were very happy with our experience. Our waiter Holden was new but very professional, engaging and did everything a great waiter should do. Even the manager Marissa stopped by to make sure we were happy with our experience. We chatted a bit and let her know that Strip was head and shoulders above Red in our eyes.  We will be back and probably bringing friends next time.  Prices were very reasonable for top notch food on offer.  Couldn't be happier or recommend it move!"}
{"text":"Wanted to give Strip another visit before finally writing a review.  Just like my first visit, I came away thinking that while Strip serves up a pretty good steak in an environment with a cool vibe, the food lags behind the other top steakhouses in the area.  Had dinner at the bar in the seat closest to the open kitchen, which was a pretty cool experience in itself.  I could easily hear the chef barking out orders (including my own) and at one point in the meal the grill cook leaned over and asked me how I liked my steak.  I could even smell my dessert coming well before it was actually brought out to me.  Dinner started out with complimentary pretzel bread served with peanut-butter butter as well as regular butter.  The peanut butter version was better than I thought it would be, with the peanut flavor controlled and offset by the creaminess of the butter.  By way of comparison, though, I highly prefer the pretzel bread served at Hyde Park.  For an appetizer, I found the Pierogies of the Day to be a little bit of a misnomer--texturally more resembling large fried wontons than anything else (though with a thicker, slightly more doughier shell).  For the holiday season, the pierogies came with a pumpkin filling, but not nearly enough filling was put in each piece given the large proportions of each pierogi.  On top of that, it was hard to focus in on the taste of the filling given the traditional sour cream and onion toppings.  I would likely pass on the pierogies in favor of another appetizer or soup on a future visit.  For the main course, I went with a medium rare Cowboy steak--a 22 oz. bone-in ribeye.  It was a decent cut of meat and cooked to the desired temperature, but I think that the steak sat around a little too long in the kitchen.  I'm all for letting a steak sit a little bit to let the juices redistribute, but I'd rather have the bulk of that sitting around done while the steak is on my plate; hitting the peak just after I've made my first couple initial cuts.  Also, you won't find that nice char on the outside of the steak at Strip that you can at some other places.  I am a little wary (disappointed, really) on how Strip does their butter toppings by serving up the steak with a 4 sq. in. heap of butter sitting on top rather than applying melted butter on both sides of the steak in the kitchen.  Serving it up that way does less for the taste of the steak and isn't that aesthetically appetizing either.  I went with the Apple Honey Bacon Butter, but the \"Apple Honey Bacon\" part of the topping really wasn't discernible (meaning, on the steak) until I cut off a little piece and applied it to some bread.  The Au Gratin Potatoes for a side dish were outright bad.  The potatoes were cooked but far from hot, and the cheddar cheese on top was already melted and cooled by the time the dish got to me.  Clearly the dish suffered some sort of timing problem in the kitchen, but I speculate that it really wouldn't have tasted all that great even without those difficulties.  I ended up taking most of the potatoes home and finally dumping them after a day or two in the fridge and absolutely no desire to eat them.  The S'mores for dessert were probably my favorite thing I had that night.  Simple enough, this is a chocolate brownie covered in marshmallow cream in between two graham crackers themselves covered in chocolate and whipped cream, all served up piping hot--I counted 18 seconds between smelling the dish from the kitchen and having it placed in front of me.  I thought that the service was friendly and attentive.  For diners at the bar, I thought the placemat was a nice touch you don't often see, and I liked the specially-sized dish for holding utensils.  The bartender checked in fairly often, and I appreciated the grill cook asking how the steak turned out.  As I mention above, I thought that all the food could and should be brought out faster.  The wine list is significantly more limited at Strip than its peer restaurants, but I did enjoy the higher end reds that they offered by the glass.  As for ambiance, Strip has a cool vibe about it, in contrast to the more traditional steakhouses.  The space being a converted barn is interesting, though I could have done with something other than the odd white tabletops.  All things considered, I think Strip sits at the end of the higher end area steakhouses I've been to (Morton's, Red, Cabin Club, XO, and Hyde Park), but still merits three stars as, on balance, a more positive than negative experience."}
{"text":"Tonight I had Berkshire pork chop bone in with whiskey glaze. Garlic mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. Excellent on all counts. Ask for Mike if you want the best server. Bloody Mary is one of the best I've had. Yes, we will continue to come back."}
{"text":"At this moment in time I cannot think of a better steakhouse experience than the one I had at Strip while out for Galentine's Day (ladies celebrating ladies).   The restaurant has a barn theme to it, but more intimate upscale vibe than your Uncle Vernon's cow barn out in Montana. My friend and I were seated upstairs in a table off to the side that allowed us to have a view of the place while still feeling like it was just us eating dinner and chatting away. Our waitress was excellent - very pleasant and we lacked for nothing (she did recite things fast so I had to ask her to slow down and repeat, but that's super minor). The manager even stopped to ask us how our meal was going.   We decided to do the couples dinner for $88. It includes two 6oz filets with choice of butter/sauce, two soups or house salads, two sides, and one dessert, oh and don't forget the warm pretzel rods with peanut butter. Incredible value! You get a wonderful meal at an affordable price!  We were a bit gluttonous and started with the cheese and shrimp dip with flour nachos appetizer $10. It was slightly sweet but still very good. I wasn't a fan of the peanut butter butter but the soft pretzel stick was good. Side salad was okay, eating some greens made me feel delusionally better about my heavy meal. I got my filet cooked medium with a garlic butter and it was perfect. Like melt in your mouth meat. For sides we got the cheesy scalloped potatoes and the creamed corn. Ooh my so good and enough for four people! We ended our meal with raspberry cobbler that included ice cream and whip cream. I had to be rolled out like Violet from Willy Wonka but it was a glorious meal.   Also, pay attention to the decor, they have hands and other art pieces on the wall that you can slip money into for a great cause. All donations go to Genesis House, a domestic violence center because \"Hands are meant to help, not hurt\". Instantly I loved this place even more for helping others!   I would definitely come back and recommend!"}
{"text":"Everything about our meal was great.  The service, the food - all top notch.  As is expected, you will drop a few bones here, but you will get your money's worth.  I will make special mention of the \"Caveman\" steak I enjoyed, which was a Wagyu Ribeye served on the bone.  One of the better steaks I have had...ever.  Only subpar part of the meal was the crab dip appetizer, but that was easily overlooked by the rest of the experience.  For special occasions, or if you drop $200 on dinner on a frequent basis, this is as good a spot as any."}
{"text":"This is the best steak house I have been to in a while!  It is located in an old barn.  There are two seating areas - one upstairs, one downstairs.  There is a nice bar area downstairs, but I don't have much to comment on because we sat upstairs.  The décor of the restaurant makes the barn feel upscale yet comfortable.  Our service was fantastic.  Angel made us feel so welcome and important.  I ordered the petit filet and a salad for my meal.  The salad was light and fresh, a great accompaniment to my steak.  The filet was so, so good.  It was tender and cooked perfectly.  There are many options to add to your steak (mushrooms, butters, sauces, etc.).  Strip really wants to make their food for you!  It's a great place, and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I celebrated Sweetest Day this evening. Our server Alec or Alex- sorry his name wasn't on the receipt, was amazing! Very personable, didn't crowd us or overwhelm us with information. He asked us what we liked, then based his intro off of that. We both got the special- the bone in Wagu cut ribeye, I got mine with with the lobster tail on top. We also got a side of the scalloped potatoes. Everything was OERFECT!! For the expensive price tag- our experience tonight was perfect and it is highly recommended. We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"Our party of 6 had the absolute BEST experience at Strip last night! The cocktails were exquisite, the food was EXCEPTIONALLY prepared and the decor/ambiance was perfect. The staff was also very pleasant and accommodating, truly a job well done (ha! Steak joke!)!!   We have found our new favorite spot and can't wait to return!!! Thanks, Strip: you totally nailed it!"}
{"text":"This place was very hyped up to us so we've gone twice now.   First experience: dinner for two. Bread and butter was something different and very tasty. Filets were excellent and cooked to perfection. Our two sides of Mac and cheese and potatoes au gratin were nothing special. Overall wasn't that impressed and didn't care to go back.   Then my husband heard about their happy hour so we went again, more recently.   Second experience: cool location by the kitchen so you felt like you were part of the action. I got Thur fish fry and it was nothing special. Their French fries are humongous and also nicely seasoned, the coleslaw was good and the fish was ok. Pretty greasy and soggy for the price ($30).  My husband got the super hyped up burger which was nothing short of disgusting. Bigger isn't always better. It's 1lb of meat that isn't seasoned at all and very chewy on top of a bun half its size. It's a flavorless, impossible to eat, soggy mess.   No third tries for this place"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant.  Not just in Avon, not just in Ohio.  My favorite restaurant period.  The atmosphere is fantastic, set in an old refurbished barn in historic Avon.  Rustic looking on the outside, rugged and modern on the inside.  I'm not the kind of person who really pays attention to that kind of thing, but for some reason I appreciate the decor much more here.  I am, however, the kind of person who pays very close attention to the food.  And here it is delicious.  They start out with some complimentary pretzel breadsticks.  These are so soft and fluffy, paired with butter and a sort of whipped peanut butter spread.  It's a real struggle not to fill up on these before your actual meal comes.  The steaks are great with a wide variety of both basic filets and more extravagant preparations.  What really makes it, though, is the sides.  Each side is fantastic and they seem to have come up with a new amazing option every time I eat there.  The gruyere mac and cheese is the best mac and cheese I've ever had.  The desserts are great too, but admittedly I'm usually too full by that time to order anything."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed!!!!  So let me first off state I hate giving less then 3 stars but unfortunately this fits the bill!  My Husband and I Stopped into Strip last night for the first time with two other couples. We made reservations, were seated promptly and ordered some drinks. My husband and I split a bottle of Prisoner that was fantastic and other drinks seemed pleasant by everyone else. Service was good and attentive but here's where things started to go south.  My first pet peeve - If there is complimentary bread, serve it right away or right after the 1st round of drinks are served not after everyone turns down appetizers. The bread was delivered to the table right as we were already getting our 1st courses (salads, soups ect.)  Now to the food... My husband got the lobster bisque which was super thin and runny with what seemed to be bits or crab meat not lobster (HOW CAN YOU HAVE BAD LOBSTER BISQUE) and ordered a steak that was cooked to his liking he said it was good but nothing to brag about. I however ordered the Market price Fish entrée which was orange roughy with pesto, lobster tail and a vegetable risotto. The lobster tail was soooo over cooked it was inedible! I was super bummed because the only reason I ordered the entrée was for the lobster tail, so when our server came back I let her know the tail was over done.  She said she would let her manager know.  The next thing I know I have a women asking if she could box my meal and asked if I would like the tail added to togo box. (we were all about finished)  I told her no because I wasn't going to eat it...... thinking she would offer to have a new one cooked up but APPARENTLY OFFERING AN DESSERT WAS EQUIVALENT for the mishap.  It wasn't! I ordered a meal... I paid for that meal and that's what I wanted \"THAT MEAL\".  For the amount of money spent we could have had a flawless dinner somewhere else.  I won't be returning and in fact wouldn't recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our 23rd wedding anniversary yesterday. After seeing and hearing about this restaurant on New Day Cleveland we decided to give it a try! After a horrific experience at Redd Steakhouse, I was a little apprehensive! The minute we pulled up, and I saw the building I knew it was going to be awesome! Wow! Was it ever! The hostesses, our waiter (Holden), and Marissa were more than accommodating. The atmosphere, ambiance, and cleanliness blew me away! Our appetizer (crab dip), complimentary pretzel bread with delicious creamy peanut butter, and entrees cooked to satisfaction! We ended the evening sharing a marvelous dessert, creme brûlée.   I can go on and on about our wonderful experience, but I won't. Take my advice and try it yourself. I promise, you will be very satisfied! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love going to strip steakhouse its worth every penny. The steaks are perfectly cook by that young handsome chef who has so much knowledge about all cuts of meat. The side are huge and wonderful enough for 2 people at least. I suggested try the scalloped potatoes that are truly devine. I perfer to seat at the bar where you get the best view of the kitchen and that handsone chef . The bartenders and so hospitable and able to tell you about any wine / spirt and a story behind it."}
{"text":"I always love dining here. They have very good appetizers. The prawns are great. Steaks are good. I usually get the boiler maker ribeye with the tarragon sauce and my wife likes the stripper. The lobster bisque is awesome (which is from a local restaurant). The atmosphere is unique and the waitresses are very helpful. I also love the pretzel bread with the homemade peanut butter and other sauces that comes with the meal.y wife and I tried the waygu ribeye once as well and it was great."}
{"text":"My hubby and I celebrated our 3 year wedding anniversary here.  If you are looking for a good steak place, this is for you.  Intimate setting but you don't need to get all fancy dressed.  A large cocktail and mixed drink menu.  Enjoyed my first cocktail for over a year since I just recently had a baby.  The Mac and cheese side dish is a must!  Plus the dessert (any of them) is totally worth it.  Save room!!"}
{"text":"One of if not the best restaurant in Lorain County. The steak is always cooked perfectly and the sides are huge. The lobster bisque is phenomenal. I would recommend the dinner for 2 special. For $82 you get two salads or soups, two filets, 2 enormous sides along with a dessert to share. Great place for a special occasion or a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"This is the only pace to get a great steak cooked perfectly in north east Ohio! We love this place for dinner and you will too. It's in the Olde Avon Plaza which is a perfect location."}
{"text":"i LOVE a good steak. not your typical girl, i suppose. with that being said, i think the atmosphere of strip is fabulous. i love the upstairs/downstairs seating.  the boyfriend's steak was not prepared as he ordered so he was a little upset, which i agree, when you are paying for an expensive cut of meat, it should be prepared to spec......kapeesh? agee. we shared one of the yummy sides in which i thought were very comparable to any other steakhouse side. good but not over the top amazing good.  i would definitely go again.  i am a fan of any building that screams character and this old barn just has it going on.  i would definitely recommend this to anyone craving some good old fashion red meat! :)"}
{"text":"I'd like to start off by stating I didn't even want to write this review because I don't love giving bad or negative feedback. With that said I do think it is helpful to share my experience for others considering Strip.   After many friends have recommended Strip to me, I decided to take my husband there to branch out from our typical favorite steak restaurant. The exterior of this is probably the best part of our experience, a gorgeous barn and adorable area. After walking in we were greeted with 2 hostesses with in my opinion terrible customer service. Did not seem one bit friendly, had an awful case of RBF (google it if your confused).  We were taken to our seats, brought water fairly quickly, and then our waitress came over. She took drink orders, and then took our starters. We ordered the muscles and a house salad. The muscles were quick to come out, but the salad was no where to be found. We made our waitress very aware of a dairy allergy, she seemed very in educated about food allergies. After taking one bite of our muscles I knew there was butter in the sauce, again after making my dairy allergy known. We mentioned to her and she wasn't even certain if there was and had to check with the kitchen. She comes back apologizing and we had my husband finish them. Thank God I don't go in to anaphylactic after one bite.   Our salad was still no where to be found. It finally comes out, mediocre salad at best. Then another waitress comes out with muscles and we reply yeah we didn't order another, she was confused as were we. Our waitress comes over saying she felt terrible about the butter incident and got us a second order minus the butter. A very kind gesture, but the principle here is the severity of different food allergies.   We wait almost an hour for our entrees. And at that point we're hoping it's worth it. My husband ordered the cowboy, a bone in rib-eye. I ordered the 6 oz filet. Our sides, again very limiting on their menu with a dairy allergy, we ordered the vegetable medley special and the house fries.   After a few bites we both asked how we liked, and both had he same reaction. HIGHLY underwhelming. The steaks were both bland, and my husband said without his topped with garlic butter it would have no flavor.  Our sides were pathetic. The vegetables had 0 flavor, and were steamed. I can literally make better vegetables at home that actually have flavor and taste good. The house fries were on the border of being burned and just a bland disappointment. Again maybe our sides were just bad choices, but they were the only options that were dairy free.  At the end of the meal my husband felt compelled to mention our feelings about being highly underwhelmed and stated we didn't want any discounts and hand outs just that he thought feedback was necessary.   We definitely won't be going back to Strip and all in all were HIGHLY UNDERWHELMED. For the prices this place charges they really should make the entire experience feel worth it. From the greeting to the actual taste of the food.  Oh and don't worry there were no discounts or free bees after my husbands comments lol"}
{"text":"LOVED this place! It is a bit pricey but I felt it was worth every penny...the food and drinks were amazing and the service was fantastic. Portions were good and the atmosphere is cool. It's a great special occasion place though I was disappointed they didn't comp us a drink or dessert for the birthday we were celebrating. I had the skinny linguini and my husband the cowboy steak...both were great! Monkey bread is to die for!!"}
{"text":"The food is great. The one thing I have to say is that their sides have gone downhill in the last 12 months.  We love this place. We even had our rehearsal dinner there. But we were just there for a sweetest day dinner and something really turned me off. I am a Scotch Collector. I know how much they cost. I ordered a drink of a Dalwhinnie 15 which is a retail price of only $60.00 for the whole bottle.  I was so blown away when I got the bill that they charged me $24.00 for this average pour of this Scotch!  That is nearly half of the price of the entire bottle. I travel all around the country and I have NEVER paid even close to this! This is easily only a $12.00 Scotch at a nice restaurant.  The worst part is that when I brought it up the manager didn't even come over to say anything at all to me. All I can say is that I felt taken advantage of and it will be quite some time before I go back there."}
{"text":"Strip was in a quaint little \"village\" that offered shops as well as an ice cream place, pizza place, and some other quick stops to nosh on some food. Strip's atmosphere was really beautiful inside. It was a rustic barn with handmade iron work on the interior, as well as flashes of modern elegance.   We sat upstairs and our waiter, Charlie, was extremely friendly and patient with our group of first timers. The Moscow Mule was a big hit at the table, although they did not have the copper mugs that they are typically served in. The food was above average. I had the lamb chops, which were good, but not great. I ordered them medium rare, however, they were definitely medium. It stated on the menu \"1 pound of Colorado lamb chops\", however, the four lamb chops that I received did not appear to add up to 1 lb (regardless of the weight prior to cooking). They were however enough to fill me up. It came with a copious amount of garlic mashed potatoes and some type of relish on top. Overall it was good, but I wouldn't order it again.   The steaks at the table were fantastic. All were cooked to their liking and the sides were pretty good. The scalloped potatoes are a must (I know, as standard as that sounds... but they really were fantastic and flavorful!). The macaroni and cheese was overrated in my opinion, but decent nevertheless. The creamed corn was okay, and the seasonal vegetables were pears and butternut squash in a brown sugar butter. I didn't care for them, but they weren't bad either.   The desserts were great. The flourless cake had a strong dark chocolate flavor and was wonderful! But the highlight was the homemade monkey bread with vanilla bean ice cream and caramel drizzle on top. Holy hell on wheels was that amazing! Had our server not recommended it to us, there's no way I would have ordered monkey bread. But it was all made from scratch and I was a proud member of the clean plate club as a result!"}
{"text":"This was my first time dining experience at Strip. We received a gift card for Christmas, and my boyfriend and I decided that tonight would be a nice night to try it out. We called ahead and made reservations, but called back about 2 hours before dinner and pushed the reservations back a half hour. Staff was very accommodating to our request since the weather wasn't great outside. We ended up coming at our original reservation time since the roads weren't too bad. No problem! We were seated right away. Our waiter was phenomenal. Took his time explaining the menu. Was very prompt when clearing our table. Now to the food. My boyfriend and I did the \"dinner for two\" option. It was incredible!!! So much food! Honestly the most tender, succulent, delicious steak I have had in my life! Cooked to perfection. Can't wait to go back just for the steak. The sides were phenomenal too. We tried the mac&cheese and pierogis. So happy we had leftovers, highly recommended! Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Just went for our anniversary--had been there one other time. The food, the service, the atmosphere--all of it was exquisite. It is pricey but for a dining experience like this I don't mind paying a little more. Will definitely be one our favorite \"special occasion\" restaurants."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last week with my family. Great ambiance as its theme is a modern barn. Service was very good and the food was of 5 star quality. The only reason I distance give them five stars is because it took them 40 minutes to bring our orders out and it was slightly over priced. Otherwise it's a gem of Avon and I will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"I have been dying to dine at Strip and FINALLY the day had come when my boyfriend treated me to this gem for my birthday.   You can't imagine how excited I was.  From the moment I set eyes on the renovated barn I knew I had picked the perfect place for my 32nd birthday.   Inside was even better.  I felt a little sorry for the diners on the main floor as our hostess guided us upstairs to the main dining area. But the sadness I felt for them was short-lived once we got to our table.  I don't quite know how to describe the ambience...it was romantic yet rustic.  Whoever renovated this old barn did a fabulous job.  They maintained the original look but added modern elements that worked well together.   Now on to the best part....the FOOD!  Our waiter was very knowledgeable and I still don't quite know how he remembered and recited the specials perfectly.  My boyfriend and I started off with the Flip Flop Salad which was a cold lobster salad on top of romaine.  It wasn't too salty or heavy on the mayo, just right.   For our main course I ordered the Cowboy which was a 22 ounce bone in ribeye.  By the way, Strip only serves Gold Certified Black Angus steaks that are prime-graded and aged over 21 days. I believe I heard the waiter say that only two or three  other restaurants in Cleveland can boast this. My Ribeye was juicy, perfectly cooked, and very flavorful...forget the Béarnaise Sauce I chose to go with it...it didn't need it! Even though I couldn't even finish half of it, no worries...I intentionally ordered this huge portion so that I could have leftovers =) Which retained it's deliciousness the next day All of the side dishes they have on the menu is served family style and one could easily feed 4 people.  We ordered the Bourbon Creamed Corn which was also absolutely delicious.... I have no complaints and I was completely satisfied at Strip....I will be back, oh yes....I will be back ( I love Wayne's World)"}
{"text":"Let me start this review by saying I really, really, really  wanted to love Strip. As a BCBG it speaks to me LOL and this was to be my Xanadu - a  reprieve from suburban, bucolic, boring Avon Lake that would remind me of sweet home Chicago......however, after we gave Strip 3 solid chances to deliver (at $150 a pop!)  and they didn't consistently do so on each ocassion I think we're done now.  We kept going back on the premise that we were hoping it would be better b/c there are NO other options on the west side but how great would it be if our food was actually served hot and the steak cooked to order properly???"}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance even better food. Great dinner for business and friends. The sides are plenty for three people. The garlic smashed potatoes, scalloped potatoes... well to be honest they are all excellent. Been here twice in two weeks for business dinners, lovely place."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food was excellent as it always is.  The service was HORRIBLE.  We have been to Strip a dozen times or more and while generally the service is good, this waitress should consider a new profession.  She started to tell us about the specials but got distracted & said she would be right back.  Came back & asked us what we wanted.  We had to request that she finish the \"special\" information (all of which she read verbatim from a typed piece of paper). She gave us more information but I had to prompt her after she finished to share with us the chef's veggie dish.  Beyond that, she forgot one of our salads, forgot drinks that we ordered, auctioned off food at the table and couldn't even remember what she had in her hand let alone who ordered what, didn't bring us knives until we were almost done with our steaks (luckily the butter knife worked well to cut the steaks until we got the steak knives), didn't clear dirty plates, never checked on our table so we had to flag down other waitresses to ask for things.  And finally we asked her to pack up the delicious sides for us to take home and she never brought them back to the table.  We realized this halfway home when we were discussing just how poor the service had been.  Luckily we have been there before and had good service as I said earlier so we will give it another shot, but I will ask not to be seated in this waitress' section ever again."}
{"text":"This is the class of the West side of CLE.  100% our \"adults night out\" dinner spot, especially for special occasions."}
{"text":"I loved the food, service, decor, and ambiance but I really, really, loved the food.  I already said that but had to emphasize it again:)  Am I allowed to say organismic on Yelp? Because that was what my steak was like.  Juicy, soft, perfectly cooked, mouth watering, and delicious.  Probably the best restaurant I've been to in Avon, Ohio.  The prices are high but the portions are large enough for sharing and you may even have left overs to take home.  I suggest making a reservation cause this place gets really busy.  If you need to make a great first impression, check this place out.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant. Pretzel bread was great. Lobster bisque is a must! The meal \"the lil stripper\" was a 16oz steak and 10 oz lobster tail which were cooked to perfection. The only reason why I can't give Strip 5 stars is bc for the quality of the food compared to price. The steaks and lobster were great... But not 5 star great. I was so excited to cut into my steak... Only to discover there was a good 1/2 edge of fat around the whole steak. I had to cut a lot of the fat off before being able to eat. The restaurant also gave me a hard time about switching potatoes while ordering. I don't eat pork and asked to swap the loaded mashed potatoes for regular mashed potatoes and it took them over 15 minutes of my waitress going back and forth. But overall I would def recommend Strip."}
{"text":"This was a horrible experience! The mussels were shriveled up and smelled and tasted rancid. Both of the filets we ordered were way overcooked, and the server did nothing to rectify the situation! What a complete waste of $350.00! PLEASE do yourselves a favor and go to The Cabin Club!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place more, but the food had some strong misses (including an awful gummy lobster pasta). The staff was great though and the outdoor seating was nice."}
{"text":"I have been to Strip multiple times and every time I get the same thing because it is that good. Strip is located inside an old renovated barn and is beautiful. The downstairs is basically the bar, with some comfortable seating and a few tables. The upstairs is intimate and usually pretty quiet. It is rustic, and romantic and one of my favorite restaurants. There is an outside patio area which seems nice, and I have yet to enjoy.  Every time I go, I order the Filet mignon with the peppercorn sauce. It is too delicious not to get. As for sides, they are each a pretty large serving for 2 people. The Redskin Garlic Smashed Potatoes, and the Gruyere Mac and Cheese are solid. The Chef's Choice of Vegetable seems to be hit or miss depending on the season, however on the whole, I am usually not a big fan. I have had the Devonshire Spinach which is so-so and the Broccoli Cheese Rice bake which is awesome (and currently not on the menu unfortunately).  They serve warm soft pretzel sticks pre-entree which come with butter or a peanut butter spread. I tend toward the butter or just simply plain. As for dessert I have had the cheesecake (red velvet I believe) which is good, but not as good as the flourless chocolate cake. And the flourless chocolate cake is not as good as the S'mores which is a brownie caked between two graham crackers, with marshmallow and topped with chocolate ganache.   Go here, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Very good. Had the steak and lobster. Sides are not included but, will feed 2-3 people. Great place for special occasions a bit pricy for everyday dining. Staff is very friendly and well informed on the menu"}
{"text":"Soooo in the past, this was my go to. My go to steak, wine & sexy single spot. The atmosphere is great. The food is amazing. The bar is fun. However. The last time I was here.... with a group of friends from California, after I bragged about Strip, my steak was ordered Medium-Well & came out mooing. Tonight, on a quiet date-night Sunday, my steak came out like I was chewing my napkin on my lap after asking for a TINY bit of pink. Because I was enjoying my wine and my company, we ordered the Peanut Butter pie. Sure enough, the crust wasn't even cooked. Very obvious the bottom layer wasn't baked through. SIGH..... I love this place, but seems to be off the past 2 times."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were looking for someplace new and Strip came highly recommended to us.  First I'll say the location in Olde Avon Village's Ewers Barn was very cool, we sat upstairs looking directly down at the kitchen which was also nice.  We tried the Tater Tots as a appetizer they were not very good, tasted like they were something I could pick up at the local Giant Eagle.  The Soups were ok, nothing great either.  By far the best part of the meal was the Pretzel Bread.  I could literally of had nothing else but those and a Beer and would have been happy.  For our Entrees we ordered the Filet and the Boilermaker.  The Filet was good and cooked perfectly, no complaints there.  The Boilermaker on the other hand was very bland.  It was cooked perfectly but lacked any of the flavors mentioned on the Menu's description.  For sides we ordered the Lobster Pasta and the Broccoli Cheese bake, both were good but again nothing memorable.  The service was good, our waiter was very attentive and polite.  Overall Strip was ok, compared to restaurants in the area with a similar price tag their food really doesn't match up at all."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my 1 year anniversary of kidney transplant. Reserved a table for 5. Have never been here before and I can say that I'm very happy we chose STRIP. Our server and services were on point. Best dinner I have had in in a long time. Made it very memorable for us. The food was OUTSTANDING. Melt in your mouth and VERY good portions. I will definitely be back. Thank you for such a great experience."}
{"text":"Very cool place. Food was good. Steaks are aka carte. I had 6 oz fillet, with Garlic red skin smashed potatoes, which are served family style and enough to feed at least 3 people. They were delicious!! I also had the spinach salad, it was excellent. My son tried the lobster bisque, which he said was very good.  Our server was great, atmosphere is nice. Pretty cool decor on walls. Overall I gave it 4 stars.  Negative points, thought it was a little overpriced. Our bill for 3 people was 172 dollars. With no alcoholic beverages.  It was freezing in there, we sat in bottom dining room. It didn't look busy and I made a reservation. Disappointed in seating. Tables are plastic and too close together.   I would go back but would rather sit upstairs or at bar area."}
{"text":"We went to Strip for our anniversary and couldn't have been more pleased!  It was a wonderful experience from the decor to the service to the beyond outstanding food.  We were seated upstairs which was so charming and cozy.  For an anniversary dinner, it was perfect!  Our server was the nicest woman you could ever ask for and at a high end restaurant, that's not always easy to find.  My husband doesn't like \"stuffy\" fancy restaurants so this woman and this place put him at ease right away!  We started with appetizers - the Texas Dog, which is  corn-battered blacken steak medallions.  I didn't expect to like it (not my thing) but wow - it was really, really good!  I opted for the Tater Tots. Oh my heaven!!  I still dream about them!  They are homemade tater tots stuffed with bleu cheese and bacon.  I seriously thought about ordering a second order of them, which I NEVER do.  I got the fillet mignon and my husband got the Big Daddy, which is a 24 oz porterhouse and I swear, they were the best steaks we ever had.  (And we eat a lot of steak!)  To go along with the excellent customer service, our lovely waitress brought an entire cassata cake to our table for our anniversary!  She even wrote Happy 19th Anniversary on it.  This just speaks to the wonderful service that they provide there.  The extra step to personalize it with the year for us went a long way.  We will be back, for sure!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place...a great higher-end steak house on the west side of Cleveland?  ...it's about time.  Unfortunately, I'd rather drive all the way over to Ruth's Chris near Beachwood.  I have no problem paying $40 for a porterhouse...if it's not tough, full of gristle, and not lacking flavor.  My girlfriend had a medium-rare ribeye, which came out medium-well.  My sister had a medium steak, which came out medium-rare.  The lobster salad was decent, but nothing to write home about.  The scalloped potatoes were tasty.  The decor was confusing... Being in a barn, there was a rustic feeling, with very tacky modern art and even classic boxing photos near the bathroom.  Unfortunately, it wasn't cozy enough to make you feel at home.  Anyways....I will not be spending a couple hundred  dollars on a meal here any time soon."}
{"text":"Tried to go to Hyde Park, but X-Mas tree lighting gave us no parking. A quick search on Yelp showed STRIP as a 5 star joing, so we showed up with reservations at last second and got a seat in bar. Great atmosphere, as bluesy rock filled the room and the food was out of this world. I got the Double Barrel steak and smashed potatoes and my wife got a filet and the mac and cheese. Everything was prepared wonderfully, as was the pretzel sticks that start the meal off and the peanut butter cheesecake we got for dessert. The only thing that was sub par was the Lobster Bisque, which was very watery. Our server was knowlegeable and attentive and we went out the back door there onto a patio filled with lighted trees, benches and a fire pit that about 8 people were sitting around enjoying drinks.   This place is hidden and not in a high traffic area, but should be added to the must visit list on the west side of Cleveland."}
{"text":"First of all our waitress Sarah was the best. Things moved on and off the table with perfect timing. The steaks were perfectly cooked and fantastic. The best steak I've had in a very long time. Desserts were unbelievable. I highly suggest Strip for a great dinner.thanks"}
{"text":"Outstanding food!! Wife surprised me and took me here. Great waitresses, servers and everyone who worked there was awesome!! Loved the soup, steak, pretzel bread. Loved the barn building. ..... want to go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Strip is the place to go for steak, forget about other steakhouses in the Greater Cleveland area.  If you are fortunate to have Michael as your waiter, which we have for three of our six or seven of our visits in the last year, you'll experience the epitome of service.  Eat upstairs, if possible, at least when the beautiful patio is not open, to enjoy your conversation and marvel on the impeccable decor of the barn.  My wife loves the 24 oz. porterhouse with garlic butter, while I eat the delectable 22 oz 'Cowboy' ribeye with bacon blue cheese abundantly laden.  This is the best!"}
{"text":"Best lobster bisque I have ever had. Caveman is a big juicy steak that every man needs to eat once."}
{"text":"Amazing. Service, food, atmosphere, drinks, sides, salad, sauces, EVERYTHING was exceptional. You wouldn't expect highend food and service with the unique mix of modern, artsy, fancy , funny, awesome decor. All inside a barn? Whoever came up with this idea of putting the best of everything, all together in 1 place, is a freaking genious!   I'd just say go, you will not regret it. Hands down best place I've eaten, and I've eaten at a many high end steakhouses."}
{"text":"If you want the best experience, be prepared to spend some money. We had the ribeye and the Wagyu, and in comparison, the Wagyu was well worth the additional cost. The ribeye was an \"OK\" $40 steak, but the Caveman Wagyu was worth every penny of the $70. The service was on point, and the win e selection was excellent. We did the au gratin potato side, and that was to die for. One of the best steak joints in CLE!"}
{"text":"Strip has been my list for a few years now. I used to work at a steak and seafood house in the medina/Brunswick area and the food for the price was great. So I'm always on the hunt to find a great steakhouse closer to Lakewood that isn't priced insanely.   Now strip has $$$ as the price indicator which is true compared to other restaurants but if you are looking right at steakhouses I believe the price is more of a $$. Yes the sides are a la carte but the pricing for a steak is very reasonable. They also have a dinner for two which entails: two 6oz filets, two house salads or soup of the days, two sides and a dessert for $88. That's a great deal. We are going to try that next time.  We sat at the bar as we went on a whim and didn't make a reservation. We waited about 10mins until 2 bar seats opened up and we were served and greeted immediately. Holly the bar manager answered any questions we had as it was our first time. The seats we had at the bar allowed us to watch the cooks do their thing which was fun to watch. The decor was rustic with some modern twists.   The food is absolutely delicious. We started off with the mussels that had a rosemary white wine base and cooked with sausage. I'm not a Fan of mussels but my boyfriend loved them, I loved the base to dip the bread. Next they brought out pretzel bread with butter. Omg amazing. My boyfriend ordered the boilermaker med rare- it came out perfectly crisp on top with the most perfect warm red center. The flavors were to die for. I ordered the 6oz filet prepared med which was flavored and cooked perfectly. We ordered a side of the pierogis as well. They were topped with sour cream and caramelized onions. They were out of this world.   We can't wait to try Strip again!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. I would go here every time I went out to dinner if I could. I'd recommend it for special events as it is a terrific experience.  Every time I go, we get the steak for two. It starts with pretzel bread sticks which are tasty. They are served with butter and peanut butter. I honestly think you could eat them plain, but a little extra butter makes them even more decadent. Im not a big peanut butter fan, so that didn't really do anything for me.   Next, you get your choice of soup or salad. For a small up charge you can get their lobster bisque which my hubby loves or a signature salad.   Next up, 2 filet mignons, 2 sauces or butters and 2 side dishes to split. The side dishes are so large that they could feed a family of 4 easily. Ive tried a couple of the sauces and butters and all are delicious. We've tried a bunch of sides too and my favorites are the bourbon corn and lobster risotto. The mashed potatoes are also pretty good.  Next, you get your choice of dessert to split. We tried the smores brownie which was delicious, but super rich.  Terrific food!  Ambiance is nice too as it is a restored barn with 2 levels of seating. Kitchen is also open so you can watch your meal being cooked.  6/10/16 Had dinner tonight and it was delicious. We started with the seasonal salad that had watermelon, blueberries, greens, pumpkin seeds, goat cheese and a vinaigrette.  Tried the apple bacon and garlic butters and both were great.  For side dishes, we had the garlic smashed potatoes and scalloped potatoes. Both were really good. The scalloped potatoes had a huge layer of cheese and were so good.  For dessert peanut butter pie was really good. It was mousse on top, with a layer like a buckeye on the bottom. Really rich!"}
{"text":"What can I say? From an awesome happy hour menu with 5$ drinks and appetizers at the bar, to the amazing dinners, you can't beat this place. I've been here so many times I lost count. The hostesses are always polite and smiling, the staff has always been great. Everyone is so nice. My husband and I usually get the dinner date for two and a bottle of wine. Our steaks have always been cooked to perfection. And our sides are delicious! We leave with full bellies and a leftover box. This is a great spot for anniversaries, dinner dates, or a sneak to spot for happy hour."}
{"text":"Excellent! The attentive service and cozy atmosphere were awesome, but the food was even better. We had 3 people around 5pm today (a Saturday) and only one table and a few bar seats were still available, so definitely make a reservation if you're on a tight schedule or with a group of people. Our waiter, Michael, recommended the ribeye special, Mac and cheese, and monkey bread dessert among other things and man, was he right! Everything was so good and even with a couple rounds of drinks, the bill was still reasonable - Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I had a pretty bad experience at strip. The service was good but the steak wasn't. I first ordered the wagyu rib-eye and it was supposed to be tender highly marbled and I got something with lots of connective tissue and it was over cooked even when cut near the bone. I sent it back and received a rare filet almost 25 minutes later. It took so long for my meal to come back out that my gf was finished eating for almost 20 minutes before I got my plate. That steak was supposed to be rare to extra rare and I didnt feel like waiting again it was close to rare but the center of a 12 oz thick cut filet was not cool and the steak was not evenly cooked. The meat was very good though and very tender. Sadly dude to this long wait my sides were cold and all I really got was a bit of apology and before that basically the assertion that I don't know how steak should taste, cut, or be cooked. I have had better tasting rib eye cooked at home that I bought at a save a lot grocery. I wasn't offered any sort of concession for my extended wait and poorly cooked meal or having to wait so long for a rare filet. I do have to say the lobster bisque was quite good and the cold sides seemed like they would be good warm but I wasn't trying to eat them without my entree. I hoped I would be offered maybe a complimentary dessert for the inconvenience. I have had ribeyes from the cabin club, Hyde park, Morton's, Mitchell's, Ruth's Chris, Eddie merlots, and many other nice steak houses and this wagyu was by far the most expensive and was the worst I've had."}
{"text":"As other reviews have noted, Strip sits off the Main Street so it wasn't the easiest to see at night. First impression was great - the decor and ambiance is super cool, loved the barn and the lighting! The menu is small, which I have no issues with. It was our anniversary so we wanted to eat some awesome meat. The hubby ordered the pork chops, which was fine but they refuse to accommodate your preference for sides. The chops HAD to come with baby bokchoy, which my hubby hates, they refused to allow even a switch for an up charge. It was just very strange. I mean I get the plates are planned by the chef carefully, but something like bokchoy isn't everyone's cup of tea. Anyway, I wanted to order a streak, and the steaks all come sans sides, so you have to order a side extra. No problem, except the sides are all family style - ughhh! So for two people we have to order a family sized side? Strip is making this too complicated. Long story short, we ordered corn on the cob so the hubby could eat corn and I literally pushed his bokchoy onto my plate (idiotic) and I ended up eating that, along with corn since we had enough to feed five people.  Ok, so rant over. The steak was seriously the best streak I've eaten in my life. Hands down. I'm a Midwest girl too, I know my beef.  The pretzel appetizer/bread they bring out to the table was so damn delicious. I wanted to just eat the butter alone. Seriously worth the calories!  Our waitress was not the best. She seriously neglected the crap out of us. I felt like she assumed we were a young couple that was poor or something so she was writing us off from the get-go. I was kind of irritated as she spent like 10 minutes just BSing with the table next to us as they had ordered dessert and other menu items (bigger bill). I was going to tip appropriately and then some but her attitude sucked royally, plus she was snippy about our kind request to change out that damn bokchoy.  Overall, best steak ever! Service was spotty. Seems like a better place when you have a group of four versus a couple. Knowing what I know now, I'd go back but order differently to avoid some of the menu pitfalls."}
{"text":"So here is the thing with Strip. The food is amazing. If you want a really good steak in a cool hidden little gem- try Strip. They also have great pretzel bread and cool drinks. What bothered me was on two separate occasions I went to have dinner and I showed up at the restaurant about 15 minutes before closing. They sat me down then told me I had MINUTES to order. Literally. Like I believe the one time they gave me exactly 6 minutes. I mean seriously if I'm coming in to eat with my significant other and we are going to spend almost $200 on dinner and drinks- we want to be able to take our time and enjoy ourselves. Not be rushed at all. Even if it's at the end of the night before closing. If they take the table they shouldn't put any time constraints. It just put a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"The food at Strip is incredible! I would give it five stars, however I think it's slightly overpriced for what you get. The steaks are very well cooked and the sides are decedent.   The customer service at Strip is OK. I was with a party of eight and someone thought they found plastic in their dinner. The chef came out and said it was not possible and disagreed with them.   We have never had a bad experience here besides the top one I mentioned and really do like to celebrate our special occasions here!"}
{"text":"This is the best barn you will ever eat in. Seriously. They took a historic barn and transformed it into a two tiered space that is at once rustic, spare and elegant. This would be an excellent spot for a romantic, relaxed date or for a gathering of friends intent on eating some beef.   Yes, the beef was good. It is the reason the place is called strip (as in steak). Sorry guys. With every cut, you get your choice of infused butters or sauces. There were a few traditional choices and a few innovations. I had a peppercorn sauce, a translucent brown gravy that tasted great over my smashed spuds.   They do a lot of other things well, too! The short stack-- cornmeal pancakes with crab gratin-- was rich and mind blowing. The tots with blue cheese and pancetta were cute and tasty. Mon cher chou's Cap'n Crunch crusted chicken was tasty-- but too sweet to eat very much. My daughter's fresh pasta with rosa cream sauce was utterly spectacular-- rich, herbal and savory with strong flavors of fresh tomatoes and sausage over two kinds of Ohio City Pasta.   The service was very friendly, helpful and attentive without being pushy or hovering.   There is no children's menu, but the kitchen served up the pasta with the sauce on the side for my daughter. There are also large side dishes of mac and cheese that might be acceptable. I would only take an older, very well behaved child here-- it's rather quiet, low key and adult."}
{"text":"In a restored century barn is hidden a most excellent restaurant!  It was our first visit and not our last!  Our party of 7 were all impressed with both the meal and the service!  None of us had complaints.  For a special occasion, try The Strip."}
{"text":"Strip is one of the best steakhouses in the area, on par with Cabin Club and better than Hyde Park.  I enjoyed the option to get a dinner for two around $75 where the menu lays out the different steak, salad, side, and dessert options.  My wife and I really enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"Why has it taken me so long to try this place?  Without question the best restaurant in Avon!!  Nice selection of food on the menu but as the name says, steak is a good choice.  I also highly recommend the mac and cheese as one of your sides as it is out of this world.  Our waitress Lee was excellent and did a great job.  A nice touch at the end of the night was the owner Ron Larson visited our table and truly showed interest in us and wanted to make sure we had a good night.    Looks like they have a great patio and will have to come back and have a drink or two out there next time.  You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"What a unique spot. It used to be an old barn. It used to be a house of yarn. :) Loved the decor! Not your typical steakhouse leather and cigar bar.   Our server was amazing. She helped guide us to all the goodies which included:  Hummus appetizer was yummy (hey - even a steakhouse can do good veggies!)  The tater tots, which were larger than I expected AND amazing. I had the Boliermaker which was a center cut ribeye. I was warned It was good but I would get the bone-in next time. Someone else got the Waygu and it was like a dinosaur. Get this if you have a dog...he will LOVE you and you will be more than happy with the cut.  The sided were wonderful too. The gruyere mac n cheese and the lobster pasta. I could not decide which one I loved more. I think we had a vegetable but I cannot remember for the life of me.  Great place if you find yourself in Avon."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the best steakhouse I've been to. The ambient lighting paired with attentive service delights. Best NY strip steak I've ever had. I highly recommend the peppercorn sauce to compliment. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The vibe was fab! The decor was an Eclectic mix of Art and Aspen Ski Lodge. The food was artsy while still being delicious. I definitely would go back. It would be for a treat because it was a bit pricey but worth it I think."}
{"text":"This restaurant was very underwhelming. For starters, the atmosphere and design was odd. If you are looking for a fancy place for a special event such as an anniversary, look further. There is nothing fancy or romantic about this place. As for the food, I ordered a sirloin cooked well done. Let's just say when cutting through the steak my knife came back bloody. Another person at my table had a filet which looked exactly like my sirloin but the waiter insisted I was given the correct steak. When explaining why the sirloin looked like a filet, the waiter made the statement \"We have higher quality steaks that you are not used to.\" Not only is it extremely rude to say, whether a person eats expensive, high quality steaks or not, but it is simply not true. My family and I actually enjoy trying out different high quality steakhouses from all over and know what we are talking about. I had to send the steak back twice in order to get it the correct temperature only to then get it with absolutely no flavor. Again, I have had amazing, flavorful steaks. Some may argue that getting it well done ruins the flavor but trust me as a person who regularly gets it,  it does not. Right when they set the steak down you could tell the color was off. It was very very light as if they did not put seasoning on it. If anything, well done steaks tend to be darker! We ordered sides that also tasted a bit bland. With all of the mistakes on their end, you would think they would have offered a free dessert or maybe taking the steak off the bill. But no. We are not cheap people but it's just a courtesy when the customer is so inconvenienced. All in all, huge pass. I'm just hoping these to-go desserts taste like chocolate rather than the cardboard we had at the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the best steakhouse around! Wayyy better than Nemo's! We had the best waitress Sarah who went the extra mile to make sure our time here was pleasant. The steak melts in your mouth and you can cut it with a spoon! The Mac n cheese is to die for here! I highly recommend 10/10! Ask for Sarah!"}
{"text":"I went to high school with the manager and she does a lovely job of running the place. Beautifully cooked steaks of any temperature and of many kinds! I love getting the Dakota which is a bison steak with polenta and green beans. DELICIOUS. Each steak no matter the type truly cuts and bites like a knob of butter. The soups are equally as delicious. The options are always a soup of the day and a hearty lobster bisque with delicious chunks of it at the bottom.  This type of place is for a truly special occasion type of dinner, but won't frown upon you as a business for being a casual local. Truly a great mix in a great community."}
{"text":"Atmosphere, food and service are an A+!  I love this place!   The atmosphere is a kinda cool lounge, mixed with rustic barn mixed with upscale tablecloth, mixed with modern. Cover everything? I think so.    The food is amazing. The bread are these great pretzel sticks. Appetizers are always amazing (try the flatbread pizza).  Best steaks- I had the filet (but had it cooked like the ribeye with a sugar and spice rub- amazing).  Seriously, the kind of meal where you savor every bite!   I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC! I have been here about 50 times, so I have lots of experience! I could literally write a book on this place. My husband and I have been going here for about 6 years now. We travel often and are always looking for the best of the best for food!!! Strip by far is the best steakhouse I have ever been to, and I have been to steakhouses all over, Chicago, Las Vegas, California. Strip is always better and always cheaper! RON the owner, knows exactly what he is doing. If you go ALWAYS Order a steak or filet. All of the sides are great!! For dessert, get the raspberry cobbler or trifle of the day. If you can get MIKE as your server, do it! He is The BEST of the BEST!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fancy, artistic and dark, great patio, very fancy, high class steak house. The drink selection is really good along with great choices of high end wines. The workers are friendly, great and fun. The food is very good, and the steaks are fantastic, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Short story...get a reservation no matter when you plan on coming.  Long story...this place LOOKS great. When we walked in right at opening it was completely empty. We asked the host for a table for 3 and she looked at us completely confused. She had to go and get someone else to tell us they were almost completely booked with no one there. In the time it took for her to say \"well we are almost all booked today\" 20 times we could have sat down and had our steaks ordered, about 10 minutes. On top of that no one arrived while we were standing there. There are much better steak places in Cleveland that have more than 5 tables.   Try Urban Farmer it is unreal."}
{"text":"I stopped in last night for dinner. I'm on the road for work, so it's dinner for one. The hostess was very kind and seated me right away! The waiter made a recommendation for the cucumber blueberry martini - it was great! I ordered the small filet as well as a cup of the sweet potato minestrone. The soup was very flavorful and different - in a good way! The steak came and I had asked for the honey apple bacon butter composite. Amazing! They also sent out smashed potatoes courtesy of the kitchen! It would have been enough for four people! They were delicious, but I barely touched them because I was so full! Thanks for a great evening!"}
{"text":"Had the broiler maker steak, au gratin potatoes, sautéed spinach and red velvet cheesecake.   Steak was ordered medium rare and came out medium to medium well. :/ I wish the seasoning had more flavor, as it sounded so good on the menu. Has horseradish and blue cheese sauces. Horseradish was really good and made the steak much better but the blue cheese didn't even have the flavor of the potent cheese that I love.   Sides were delicious and had a lot left over from 4 of us sharing.   Red velvet cheesecake might as well have been called cheesecake with Oreo crust because that it what it tasted like.   Meal was decent, but too expensive for what you got."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Everything on the menu is amazing it is a little pricey but well worth it. Good place to go if your celebrating like a birthday, anniversary ect. it's actually cheaper then a hibachi restaurant I have noticed. My boyfriend and I went there for our first time to celebrate our anniversary and we had an appetizer, 2 steak dinners, 2 sides, and a bottle of wine. Our bill with tip was around $170. I thought that was pretty reasonable with what we had. We sat upstairs and the decor was breath taking. Whoever designed this restaurant did an absolutely amazing job. You look downstairs in the bar area and it's cozy and relaxing. The patio/outside area is beautiful as well, they have a fire pit with tons of areas to sit at. We will definitely be back."}
