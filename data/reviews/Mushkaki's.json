{"text":"$12 for combo and burger patty was overcooked tasted like it's wasn't even beef, fries was undercooked 
no wonder this place is dead
Wendy's have better burgers"}
{"text":"I'm surprised this isn't as popular as it should be. Although I've only been here twice, everything I've tried is stellar. So far my husband and I have tasted the beef strips, the mushkaki beef burger and the mushkaki chicken and they were all cooked really well. The portion sizes are HUGE for what you pay so we came back feeling stuffed both times and only spent around $16 total! They also have complementary soup free of charge and it's always something different, but always hearty. We also tried their chocolate milkshake and it is AMAZING. Both times though there was always someone walking in to order a vanilla shake, so I know what I'm trying next time we're here - including the quesedillas!"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu tastes different and unique! I especially love the spicy chicken and alfredo. The wraps are huge and tasteful.  Great value for your money!  Would love to try the desserts next time."}
{"text":"It took 35 mins just to get a strawberry shake it takes too long horrible customer service"}
{"text":"The quality of the restaurant has started to go down.. I work close by, so i used to go there often for lunch with coworkers..the fries have started to become bad,uncooked (same from a few times). I have had chicken sandwich which is on a lunch deal, a pretty good deal, sandwich + fries + pop. The owner is a nice guy with not so help in the kitchen. Hope this place gets better and we start going there again.."}
{"text":"The service is pretty poor, and the hamburger patties in my double beef burger were literally the driest, most overcooked pieces of meat I've ever had. I was very disappointed based on all of the great reviews. Maybe this was a one off occurrence, but as I'm only visiting Toronto, I would have an opportunity to give them another chance, nor would I really want to."}
{"text":"Good service and food is delicious. Been there many times they are so hospitable. The beef is the best"}
{"text":"Quality and meal size have remained consistently great.  Staff is very nice.

A note to have patience when sitting down. The table may not be bussed immediately"}
{"text":"This is the only Somalian restaurant I've ever been too and I must say I really liked the food. For people who are visiting for the first time please try their Mushkaki fries! So Good! :D"}
{"text":"Although this is right down the street from me and apparently been open for 2 years, I had no idea it was there until I came across it on yelp. It is a little family owned place where they buy their food fresh and everything on the menu is homemade! So far I have tried their beef burger, soup and quesadillas.
First off, I am very picky about my burgers but I finally found one I enjoy! The burgers are wonderful..fresh, not too thick (I don't like extremely thick burgers, this is just right) and tasty. The quesadillas were very good as well, filled with chicken, cheese and vegetables but I have to say the winner here is the soup! It is absolutely amazing and was quite a welcome surprise! First of all if you're dining in the soup is complimentary, otherwise it is $3 for a small container that will give you just a little more then half a regular soup bowl but is so worth it! I have gone back every night this past week just to buy 2 orders of the soup. There have been 2 different kinds so far that were very similar but impossible to decide which was better. They were both a vegetable based cream soup of some sort, apparently made by the mother that have been just to die for..perfectly seasoned with just the right thickness. I think I'm addicted..lol. 
Prices are very reasonable and the people friendly. A must try if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"This is an East African restaurant worth trying.  Mush khaki fries are to die for.  Really good serving sizes,  you will definitely need a take home bag.  Chicken Kati Kati is really good too."}
{"text":"I found this hidden gem when I was searching for a restaurant for my birthday lunch with coworkers. 

If you make it to this place you are in for a surprise, the menu is great with variety of choices to indulge on. Everything is made then and is fresh!

Service was exceptional as we walked in with around 10 people and there were plenty of seats. The owner/ cashier at the till was very friendly and patient with us till we figure our what to get as everything on the menu looks good. 

Food-wise people went with burgers, Honey Garlic Chicken, Spicy Chicken, Quesadilla and Pasta w. Roseo Sauce and all the people enjoyed the food as it was fresh and hot. 
I went with Mushkaki Beef Burger which is topped with lettuce, tomato, fried egg, cheese, mushkaki sauce, ketchup, and mayo. I also added one more beef patty on to the burger...and WOW the burger was too good! hot, cooked well and yet juicy and the egg went so well with it. I also choose their spicy fries and they were very good, crispy and with a different taste. 

The portions are really good also expect a bit of a wait as the food comes out fresh. They have a TV in the restaurant for sports fan.

I will definitely come back as there is so much to try especially Mushkaki Fries. Which the owner stated is a meal to itself as it comes with chicken in the fries. 

For my Muslim Folks - This place is Halal friendly and their entire menu is Halal, also stated on their site."}
{"text":"For some reason I ended up in Etobicoke for the afternoon which is quite far from my domain in scarberia. Since I was out here already I'd heard a lot about this place and have t a try. 

I ordered a cheese burger with seasoned fries and a drink. The total case out to 9$ which is an amazing price for the quality and quantity of food I got. The burger was cooked perfectly and the fries were seasoned well and nice and crispy. Would highly recommend to all my friends."}
{"text":"I was skeptical of trying this restaurant at first but I'm glad I did. Their Mushkaki chicken is to die for. Their burgers are perfect. I also tried their chicken steak but didn't like it as much as the mushkaki chicken. 


The price is amazing for the delicious food and portions are HUGE."}
{"text":"This place was highly rated, but honestly its nothing really to special. Nothing more then a regular burger. No real distinctive favour to make it memorable. It wasnt a bad burger but it wasn't great. It's a bit more pricy for a simple burger. Probably not going head back for the reason it is out of my way and it's nothing special."}
{"text":"Saw good reviews, thought I'd try it.  Bad, bad mistake!

Very Slow, indifferent service, it appeared they could care less whether you were in their place or not.  Average quality food, but priced like a Bistro, just plain over-priced for what you get.

Then I tried the food.  Over-cooked burger, burnt outside and dry inside, and my date got undercooked chicken.  I finished eating (half was all I could stomach), before they returned with anew plate, and it was undercooked again (pink inside beside the bones).

We left, they offered no refund, and again appeared they could care less about our experience at their establishment.

Unfortunately you have to give at least one star on Yelp.  They didn't deserve it.

Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"I like it a lot but I try to always make it there before 2pm to catch the lunch special. You get a good amount of tasty food for an excellent price."}
{"text":"What is there not to love about Mushkaki?
It's a hole in the wall with good food at a very reasonable price.

This joint is run by a family and their food is Somali fusion.
T-Bone Steak ($11ish) - Very decent, properly cooked and seasoned

Mushkaki Burger ($5) - Made from real ground beef with an egg on top. Not the best burger ever but it's pretty tasty, also pretty filling for a $5 burger.

Spicy Chicken($11 with side and rice) - Really GOOOD, tastes as delicious as it looks. The rice is also cooked perfectly (dried long rice).

Chicken Kata Kat ($9) - Meh, while it was tasty, it had too much bread and not enough meat.

Mushkaki Fries ($9) - Mind blowing, best thing on their Menu! Cheese curds with their sauce and generous amount of chicken.

Best option for a good meal at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"I couldn't even wait to take a picture ! I just had to dig in. The mushkaki burger is a must have! Love it next time I'll even try the mushkaki fries."}
{"text":"Came here to verify what yelpers are saying about this place. We tried the beef burgers and they were actually tasty but on the dry side. Tasted the charbroiled grill taste of the meat. Fries were also good. We got free soups for that day we went. Place was small but there was enough seats to dine in. Saw a few people order the pasta dishes, maybe we would try some on our next visit:)"}
{"text":"Went there to celebrate my sister's birthday with a few friends...the food options are different for the usual halal places and the prices are amazing! Very cheap and tasty meals...however i am not sure if i over-ate or something was wrong with my specific order (steaks) but i threw up as soon as i got home...however everyone else was fine...so maybe just my meal was not fresh. Will go back again to find out if  throw up again or not."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype...it's a solid 4 out of 10 service was a bit slow. The food lacked flavour and was not very fresh."}
{"text":"Prices are great portion is excellent,

I ordered a muskaki burger and mushkaki fries.

The burger was good, just the meat was a little overcooked and dry, the egg on top was great still ate it no problem.


The mushkaki fries....amazing, I've never tasted anything like it, the portion is so big and the price is great.

I'm a white man and I felt just as welcome as anyone else in the resturaunt, as oppossed to some places that haven't treated me nice because I was not the normal crowd.

I'll definitely be back I would love to try the whole menu haha."}
{"text":"Ordered the Mushkaki fries. Pretty damn good, those sauces really bring the dish to life. 10 min wait in case you are in a rush like I was. Staff was decent enough, nothing extraordinary there."}
{"text":"I drive out here every few weeks for their mushkaki fries, which are the best fries I have ever tasted (close to being as good as the best poutine I had in Quebec). Trust me you have to try the mushkaki fries if you are in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Wonderful homie feel to this small family owned restaurant. Ordered food and came in less than 5 min. Each plate more delicious than the next. I was very impressed by how honest and friendly the staff were. Will defiantly come back for their pasta with Alfredo sauce. They gifted us a small cake with ice-cream on top."}
{"text":"First time visiting a Somalian restaurant. After seeing photos of the Mushkaki fries I knew I had to try it. There is an option to order it with more sauce for an additional dollar however I would argue that it's not necessary at all. It was delicious and every fry was nicely coated in sauce, however next time I would probably ask for a little less sauce as over time the fries got a little soggy. The flavour was fantastic but a little strong.. If I could describe it I would say think along the lines of Buffalo sauce.. the tangy-ness is quite similar. I found myself having to steal some of my boyfriends salad and rice as a refresher for my palate. 

We also ordered the spicy chicken plate which came with a side of rice and salad. The rice was very good and nicely seasoned. The salad and chicken were mediocre and the flavours of the two were not at all unique. The chicken, both flavour and appearance kind of reminded me of sweet and sour chicken. The portion sizes and price were fantastic! 

Overall a pretty good spot for a quick casual meal. Facilities could use an upgrade (especially the bathrooms downstairs!) and it's a little chilly in the winter time however for a quick decent meal on a budget, one can't complain. We will be returning."}
{"text":"Any burger topped with egg seems to catch my attention any given hungry moment and Mushkaki was the nearest place Yelp was directing me to, based on ratings, pics and my current appetite's cravings.

Arrived to a bit of a lineup although quickly geared to high speed as I caught view of the busy kitchen behind the counters working their magic.

That magic was put into their Mushkaki fries. Now the burgers were good but not great, $5 price tag for a legit juicy burger suffices the purpose of a proper burger joint.

Mushkaki fries came at a price tag of $9.99 and the fries portion wasn't as generous as expected with the value. Thank God the unique sweet, tangy and cajuny sauce and chicken pieces drowned any possibility of disappointment.
Not enough for 2 people to enjoy. Seems like a full meal but not quite filling.

All in all, would only return if I was in the area. Maybe place 2 orders of Mushkaki fries next time for sure."}
{"text":"The food is very amazing. I had the rice and chicken steak and the chicken suqar and rice. Both dishes were made with excellent taste and I and a blast eating them. I would recommend this place to my friends any day of the week. Great customer service and great ambience. Also the mango shake was pretty good with the ice cream topping and I also like the strawberry shake as well. If anybody lives in the Rex dale area, stop by this place and order something off their menu, I guarantee you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The service at this halal restaurant is great. The menu has a lot of variety. Everything is freshly made and tasty.

I spent like literally 10 minutes looking at the menu trying to pick 1 thing because I wanted to order like 4 things. They had everything from burgers to pasta to ribs.  There's something for everyone here.

Mushkaki, I learned at the restaurant, is Arabic and East African for \"bbq\" or \"grill\".  The staff were very very friendly and well acquainted with the customers. They were happy to explain menu items with pride and make a suggestion.  

I decided to go for the mushkaki fries. It was fries with barbecue sauce, cheese sauce, green onions and sauteed chunks of chicken. It was very tasty. And very saucy and strong in taste. The BBQ sauce was kind of sweet but very BBQ'y. As an adult I would say that it probably had too much sauce but I think teenagers and kids would like it.  If you are interested in this dish, I would just suggest that you ask them to just drizzle the bbq sauce on the dish.

Everything is freshly made so expect to wait a little bit before you get your meal. You can call ahead and order and pick it up. 

There is a lot of seating and there is a TV that had sports on.

I would say that this place is good for family n friends hang to out for a quick bite.

I will be back and I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Let's just say Mushkaki Fries. Typed in Burgers in the Rexdale area and Mushkaki popped up I've seen it beside the Double Double joint but never knew the name. Finally decided to check it out, because my girlfriend and I were craving some burgers. 

Nice small space, great friendly staff, and an easy to read menu. It's Somalian inspired which they have different types of dishes, which I wanted to try but my goal was a burger that day.

Got 2 Mushkaki burgers which were okay nothing special but an okay burger. BUT THE MUSHKAKI FRIES THO!!!!! The fries were smothered in a sauce and bits of fried chicken chucks which had me going crazy over these fries. 

Not going to lie I had to put these fries really up there on my list. Definitely would go back just for the fries.  And I honestly can't wait!!"}
{"text":"I was expecting better results from the reviews.. honestly.. I'd give it 3 stars personally.. the only reason for the 4 stars is because of the Mango Shake! It's sooooo good! And the beef Makshaki or whatever burger it's called.. is pretty decent, I'd order it again.. Now I got the Makshaki fries and I did Not enjoy it.. if you like Bbq sauce then you will be in Heaven.. I only like Bbq sauce on bbq'd food.. the fries and chicken were DRENCHED in bbq sauce.. that's discusting to me.. it was a little much.. but I'm about to get zoned in approximately 10 minutes.. so I guess my left overs will taste amazing then, hehe. The End. Lololol but I recommend for the burgers definitely and I will get plain fries next time."}
{"text":"It's located next to a gas station, noticed it while pumping gas. I had the Mushkaki fries, which are sweet with pieces of fried chicken being semi hot. I also had the Mushkaki burger which I didn't fancy to much because it comes with a fried egg on the beef patty. The owner is hard working and makes most of the menu from scratch. 
However it is a Somalian restaurant in which the menu is inspired from. Another note the washrooms are bad and are located in the basement of the unit. If your in the area of Kipling and Rexdale, get the fries."}
