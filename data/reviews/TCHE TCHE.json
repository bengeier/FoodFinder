{"text":"What i love most about tche tche is the atmosphere. Its so laid back i feel as if I'm at home relaxing and smoking with friends. The only thing i dislike is the music, but it's not a big deal."}
{"text":"This place is difficult to review due to their inconsistencies. I will break it down. 

Atmosphere - it's almost always great. The lower level is great for grabbing a quick bite and the upper is a very cool lounge with sofas and chairs for shisha smoking. The only times I felt uncomfortable is when they hire random DJs to play shitty hip-hop off his Macbook.

Food - Never tasted bad but always made differently. Its as if they have a new chef and product every time I go. Fires are always great though.

Shisha - This should be the star of the show. Again, I've had both spectacular and completely terrible shishas here. They do provide extra coals but expect you to light and use them yourself.

Overall I'm very conflicted about this place. It has great potential and I will probably go again since they are open very late and no line ups."}

Freshly made

Good service

Waited sometimes but was worth it"}
{"text":"Garbage, I would give no stars if I could. Shisha tastes like they re used the last shisha they served to the last customer. Ordered a shawarma tasted like old Arabic uncle didn't wash his hands making my wrap. I prefer you go somewhere better like shishalicious or fusion."}
{"text":"Didn't enjoy the atmosphere, the staff seems aloof most of the time. You're lucky if you get asked what you'd like to order. Shisha & food was borderline ok and not consistent in quality control. There is so much competition in the Shisha business, management needs to wake up and smell the orange mint."}
{"text":"gave us a broken hose and told us it was \"new\" ... definitely not! mango smoothies were disgusting, we couldn't even drink them.

you have to order at entry, not guaranteed a good seat or food. Atmosphere was rough, burnt tables, terrible speakers. 

service was below par for a shisha place"}
{"text":"This place must be the WORST shisha place in Canada. The service was horrible. We had walked in and asked for 1 shisha and the server, who was completely rude, she had an attitude and was unprofessional , had insisted that we had to buy 2 shishas because there was 4 of us... WHAT?!?! Are you serious?!?! Okay, fine. We got the 2 shishas, and it was the worst shisha ever. The orange mint tasted like Orange Pledge, literally felt like I could blow smoke on my table and wipe it.... And when we asked to see if the shisha was okay, the guy jus smoked it and said \"its orange mist\", great customer service there buddy. So we had to sit there, smoking 2 shishas, one that tasted horrible and the watermelon which was mediocre. Never going there again. I would have been better off driving an hour to Habibiz."}
{"text":"Worst service i've ever had. How are high schoolers even allowed in here. The food we got was terrible and the shisha was even worse. 

You have to pay before hand so they don't care when you get served."}
{"text":"Not the original tche tche that's for sure! They made it look like the real thing on the outside but it definitely doesn't look like it"}
{"text":"Isn't worth your money to be honest lot's of better lounges near by so instead of wasting your money to smoke in cold dingy place invest it somewhere else"}
{"text":"It's a place that lacks originality. One day they have terrible shisha, the next day it's tolerable. They seem stingy in terms of providing you coal and they are rude sometimes if you tell them you're waiting for something. 
This is why this area doesn't take off. Management needs to show a little more humility.
The staff seemed very irresponsible as they were always ignorant of any of our requests but we finally decided to get up and leave."}
{"text":"Wings Plus Things is the halal hangout I wish I had when I was growing up.  Good food, great prices and a pretty awesome venue to hang out with your friends (open until 3am on the weekends).  

The chicken shawarma was really good.  What sets it apart from most other shawarmas is the fact that it was pressed and served in a manner where I felt like I was eating a chicken shawarma panini...different, but in a great way.  

What I liked most about this place was the atmosphere.  They have a very nice lounge located on the second floor.  They have comfy leather sofas, a big screen tv and they servce sheesha which makes for the perfect place to hang out with a the friends on a Friday night.  The food and atmosphere are of great value.  Whether you want a shawarma with pop for $5.99, or if you feel like splurging a bit and having a shawarma, pop and sheesha for $14.99, you will not be dissappointed for what you pay."}
{"text":"I came at 12pm on a tuesday and theyre supposed to open at 10am.
Dont go here so unprofessional and lame and a waste of time i would give them negative stars rating if i could."}
{"text":"The first picture posted here for this business fooled me, gave me the impression that this place is huge & massive, beautiful and spacious patio, must be crazy busy affording all of that, with some great menu selections as they're claiming a franchise name/brand that is very well known in the middle-east for being a leader in this category.

Once you walk in, you get shocked and slapped in the face for a strong reminder not to believe what you see and read online!

The place is literally 5-10 tables max, with a \"second floor\" that's like a private hidden place! For WHAT?! I have no clue!

The place smells beyond unacceptable, it looks and feels so dirty..
I obviously didn't try their food for obvious reasons, but tried a quick hookah for about 30 minutes, and it's nothing different from the whole experience.

Service consists of a teenage girl and an old man who turned out to be the owner of the place!

How can such places exist in the GTA in 2018!? That is beyond me!"}
