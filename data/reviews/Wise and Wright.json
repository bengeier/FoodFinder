{"text":"I love all the healthy choices popping 
 up around town. 
Made a visit to Wise and Wright before a rowing class.
They have lots of options for all kinds of diets, and I like their use of real cutlery, and recyclable to go containers.
It's a bit on the pricier side but you are paying for originality and quality food. 
For the time being, they offer $2 premium coffees from 2:30-6pm Mon to Friday.
Had a pretty smooth and creamy capuccino. There is almond milk available for non dairy drinkers.
Will definitely be going back to try the breakfast/ brunch menu."}
{"text":"My new obsession! LOVE everything about this place.  I've never left a restaurant feeling so good about myself! The menu choices are all interesting, wholesome and unique and their ingredients are SO SO fresh. Perfect portion sizes and reasonable prices. It's only a matter of time before they will be lined up out the door at lunch. HIGHLY recommend the kale and broccoli salad."}
{"text":"??? Did I drop by on a bad day? What is with the hype?? Maybe my taste buds just reject super healthy food so I'm not able to appreciate this place like I should? Either way, I hated it. 

A friend & I stopped in here for lunch on a Friday just before the lunch rush. We ordered the moroccan chicken flatbread with the broccoli kale quinoa salad, a pork loin bowl, and a waffle. The flatbread probably tasted the best, but was a WTF level when it came to cutting it. Honestly it was the worst, either they need to hand out steak knives with the flatbreads or present options for it to be cut up into bite sized pieces. The flatbread comes with a side of salad in a little bowl which we appreciated until we took a few bites & just bleghed at the level of saltiness. Whoever made the salad that day literally seasoned the kale with so much salt I felt dehydrated after having a few bites. The pork bowl was quite boring and the squash was seasoned with a very sour vinegary taste.... whether or not it was on purpose we will never know. The bowl was mostly untouched... we both were just not feeling the bowl that day. The waffle was also disappointing because how can you fuck up a waffle? It wasn't fluffy, it was quite dense & the whip cream it came with had coconut in it... ehhh was neutral on the coconut. 

We also purchased a pressed juice, and an iced tea. The iced tea is literally just maybe slight steeped tea with lemon so it tastes like lemon water. I'm usually a huge fan of pressed beet juices but it was just very bitter and though I did finish it, I only finished it because I convinced myself that it's good for me and I paid $7 for it. 

Bad lunch aside, I did really enjoy the atmosphere of the little shop, and their decor is quite clean, modern, and cute. Little succulents placed here & there with wooden bench tables. Maybe better to just drop by and sip a coffee?"}
{"text":"My experience at Wise and Wright was pretty disappointing. 
My husband and I came here for brunch today. I ordered a cappuccino, and the Spanish breakfast bowl, while he ordered a pour over and the salmon benny. 
He was happy with what he ordered, and when I tried his benny, it was quite delicious. The tartness of the hollandaise sauce was well paired with the smoked salmon. 
My meal wasn't so nice. My cappuccino was actually a latte, with less than 1/8 an inch of foam. My rice was still crunchy, and sitting in a puddle of water. The meatball was cold on the inside. In fact, my whole meal was barely warm. It was pretty flavourless. It was a very lacklustre experience for me.
Take your chances with this place, if you decide to come here. Some dishes seem good, and others, barely edible."}
{"text":"Walking into W&W, a sign on the wall states \"Quality over Quantity\" greets you and you know you're in a good place.

Your three categories to choose from for eats includes flatbreads, salads and wise bowls. I went with the Coconut Chicken Bowl (coconut turmeric brown rice, roasted coconut chicken and veggies in a curry sauce). Not only does it sound delish, it also tasted delish.

They serve your food in compostable containers (yesssss) and you can choose to dine in or take out. I opted to stay and enjoyed my bowl with some refreshing infused water (available free of charge!) and gazed out the window as I ate my lunch. 

It does get busy (aka noisy) in here during the rush, so if you're looking for a quiet place to nourish yourself, I'd suggest to do carry out or come at an off time."}
{"text":"More like Wise & Wrong. I understand what they're trying to do but they need to do it better. I ordered the Spanish Chicken Bowl and it was almost offensive. A couple pieces of mushy zucchini and soggy onion just didn't do it for me. Not to mention the flavorless chicken and abundance of brown rice was enough to make anyone feel like they were eating a backpackers meal in Central America. I would have rather eaten at Jugo Juice.

Would not recommend."}
{"text":"My new spot for coffee and quick lunch. 
there are aslo healthy food option available ."}
{"text":"I bought the $3 Carrot and Cardamon muffin, the flavour was bland and it wasn't bake all the way through.  I can say I've been here, but won't be back.  Prices are expensive."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, after giving Wise & Wright 10 or so chances I am just not impressed. I love the idea of healthy food with superfood ingredients so I keep trying this place hoping it will finally live up to my expectations. I've tried a different item on the menu each time and so far the only thing worth my time was a flatbread. The thyme turkey meatball has no flavour and the rice wasn't fully cooked at all. The spicy vegan pho was possibly one of the worst things I've ever tasted. The spice wasn't flavourful it was just burning my throat and making me cough. Then the pho had plain logs of tofu floating in it. The avocado toast was good but nothing better than I could make at home. The breakfast sandwiches look sooo delicious... then once again they have no flavour and have a watered down sauce dripping out of them. The smoothie I got tasted so bland (at $6!!) it was mostly coconut milk so it tasted like fat and my friend even mentioned it tasted like butter. I'm not sure exactly what's going wrong with this place but I still hope the best for them and hope they revamp their recipes!! Overall, their coffee is delicious and the service is amazing which is what got them 2 stars. I won't be coming back until the food matches the price tag."}
{"text":"Delicious. I ordered the Achilles Heel chicken and quinoa bowl. The order taker was happy to accommodate my need to make a substitution  due to allergies. The food was served wonderfully warm without any of the restaurant industry seasonings and fake ingredients which can mar the taste of good food. Very pleased to discover this place."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for healthy, and equally important taste. Creative, flavorful dishes all around with influences from all over. A great/better alternative to Freshii. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Healthy, great tasting food.  I am in love with their vegan power cookie! I've also tried a few of their bowls and the Thyme Scented Turkey Meatball Bowl gets my vote! Yes, they are a tad pricey (nothing too extravagant) but small details such as using compostable takeout containers and utensils justifies the cost to me.  I've been there three times and service is always good - the servers are more than happy to provide assistance!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here while traveling from Seattle. Loved the look and atmosphere which drew me in to check it out. Their health food options are really great whether your looking for breakfast, something refreshing, lunch or dinner. I had their savory breakfast muffin which tasted really fresh and packed full of healthy ingredients. I also enjoyed their Matcha latte. Check this place out. It's sure to be your next fav. 

p.s - they have fast, reliable internet. :)"}
{"text":"I'm so glad Calgary FINALLY has a place that serves healthy food, a lot of it sourced locally. I love the minimalistic but modern interior. I have been here a couple times now, each time getting great service. The food is delicious and plated beautifully. The prices are pretty reasonable and there's a lot to choose from. 
I had the chicken coconut curry bowl (I don't know if that's the exact name), the portion was a good size, not too heavy but a good amount. 
ALSO they have coffee happy hour after 2pm! How do you even say no to $2 specialty coffees. 
I'm definitely going to be here often when I go downtown!"}
{"text":"Pretty good! I ordered from DoorDash because I am from out of town. I ordered the Jamaican bowl with jerk jackfruit with shrimp and it had good flavor. I also ordered the mushroom bowl either salmon to eat tomorrow. I tried both and they are tasty. Portion size is good too!"}
{"text":"Great new spot open on Stephen Ave, close proximity to my office is appreciated and the healthy options are great. Haven't tried the food yet but they have good coffee options and a great latte deal in the afternoon. The Banana & Walnut Bliss smoothie is like drinking liquid banana bread."}
{"text":"Upon seeing their Instagram account, I was immediately intrigued. Wise and Wright definitely seemed to have a comprehensive menu that included all the trending health foods, such as quinoa, kale, and smoothies among other items. As a person who is quite active and is somewhat conscious of what I eat, I was definitely excited to try it, but unfortunately, it ended up being a huge let down.

The space itself is cozy and cute, tucked right beside the Cactus Club Cafe in the heart of downtown. I ordered the vegetable super bowl with roast chicken, and for a price tag of $14, it was far from \"good value\".

The food was... bland. The roasted vegetables in the dish had a hint of spice, but lacked essential seasoning (salt and pepper) that would've really boosted the flavour. The same could be said for the chicken, which was also incredibly dry. 

The thing that really sealed this 2-star review for me was that they didn't properly debone the chicken and that there were small pieces of bone that I had to remove while I ate.

Wise and Wright, thank you for attempting to provide Calgarians with a healthy alternative for lunch, however, I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I decided to try their Omega 3 Superfood - has salmon, Cajun shrimp, curried lentils and chickpeas, flax seeds, cut-up celery and onions, - all in a shallow curried, slightly spicy broth.  No carbs which suits me fine.  High in Omega 3 and lots of fibre.  

Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars...LOVE this place! Everything I have eaten there  (magic mush bowl, coconut chicken bowl, ahi tuna poke salad, poached eggs) has been delicious!!! We even opted to have them cater our Xmas lunch this and all 17 people loved their food. Had the Turmeric Latte which I enjoted greatly as well...even the bits of fresh ginger that I had to spit out! 
It can be busy which is why the app is great so you can order ahead and pick up. However...the app needs some work still...not everything is on it. Hence the 4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the matcha late with almond milk.  They have lots of healthy eats. I haven't tried them but a lot of people order them. They also have happy hour from 2:30 pm to 6 pm on weekdays for $2 a coffee (small size only)."}
{"text":"Fantastic concept. Quality fast service place, delicious healthy and creative options AND to top it all off a serious coffee programme that's brought a completely new-to-Calgary roaster (LA's Portola) to town. This morning I had a \"brunch bowl\" that had brown rice, yellow beets, a poached egg, and they \"yogurt hollandaise.\" This could've been a disaster in so many ways- the rice could've been mush, the beets over- or under-cooked or over/underseasoned, the egg a too-hard nightmare, the hollandaise a mistake, and the portion tiny. Nope on all counts- it was delicious! Nicely nutty well-cooked brown rice, beautifully cooked beets just on the cusp of crisp and with a judicious amount of salt, a perfect poached egg, and a yogurt based sauce that added just the right note of sour and richness. Minced chives too. Finally the portion was ample, a really good deal at just $8!"}
{"text":"One of my go-tos for ordering vegan lunch at the office! Love the food, especially the breakfast bowl, I ordered today (couldn't wait for lunch - I was hungry!) I thought it was awesome that there was no plastic bag when it was delivered, but there was a straw (I didn't order a drink), and full cutlery. A fork would've been great, but the other stuff is kind of a waste and totally unnecessary, especially when we're working on phasing out plastic straws in our city! Just a suggestion, going forward -"}
{"text":"I was so happy to find a healthy yet delicious spot in downtown Calgary for a quick lunch in the middle of the workday. Wise & Wright has delicious bowls and salads (with some options for breakfast as well) that are served up quickly but taste incredible. I got the coconut chicken rice bowl that was perfect for a chilly day, and it was ready in less than 5 minutes. The portions don't look huge, but I filled up completely off my bowl - didn't even have room for the delicious vegan power cookies that I had my eyes on! 

Only wish the space was a little bigger. I felt rushed eating my meal as the place got busier, and it was a little chaotic trying to navigate around the tables to pick up my order, grab silverware, etc."}
{"text":"I came into Wise and Wright with high expectations. It looks like a healthy alternative to the other options in downtown and the interior is clean and modern. Unfortunately, I left disappointed.

I ordered the Banana & Walnut Bliss smoothie ($7) with the Thyme Scented Meat Ball Bowl ($12). The person I ordered from said the bowl was great and would be enough food for two days! Unfortunately, there was no bliss in the bland tasting Banana & Walnut smoothie... a Jugo Juice smoothie has 100x more taste. Then my Meat Ball Bowl came... true to the description it was indeed one, fairly large, meat ball with a lonely piece of thyme on top. Unfortunately, the meat ball was dry and served on top of a small serving of rice. Apparently they forgot to include thyme or any other spice in the meat ball to make it taste as good as it sounded on the menu.

Maybe they were just having an off day but I left after spending $20, hungry and without enough food for two days."}
{"text":"I foresee this being my new spot downtown. Wise and Wright make their mark by being Calgary's newest spot emphasizing on local, healthy eats and are doing an AMAZING job at it as well. Their menu is fresh, the service is quick and they all around have a very lively vibe. Above it all, I find the prices to be actually pretty reasonable compared to other healthy places. For $10 you can get a side salad (or soup) and one of their flatbreads, the chipotle squash one is delicious! I also recommend you try their cashew cup, great treat for later! Most of their menu is vegetarian (and possibly could be made vegan?) and you have the option of adding chicken to their dishes if you like (and they don't skimp out on it either!)

Like any place downtown, it can get pretty busy during the lunch rush and sitting fills up quite quickly just as a heads up. It's a small joint so it can feel a little cramped at times. Overall, I love the place so far and can't wait to try out more items."}
{"text":"This place is so much more than coffee and snacks. I have been here 2 days in a row for lunch and it is healthy yet delicious!! The flatbread and salad is a great value ($10) as I often prefer more than 1 item for lunch. The kale, quinoa and broccoli salad is my new addiction. The ingredients are super fresh and everything is made to order. They also have brunch and loaded toast which is what I'm going for next time. The cashew cup is to die for! It's like a fancy Reese's peanut butter cup but with cashew and real chocolate. This is definitely my new lunch spot!"}
