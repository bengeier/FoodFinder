{"text":"These cats got it all going for them. Taste, price and coolness. If your all into the scene and need to be catered to, like your paris hilton, don't bother. It also has a great market selection, mine being the deserts and sweets. The plates have some good choice, I go the way of a main kabob, rice (mmmm), hummus and fries. They also lay on the pita bread, so its all good here. Oh, and be sure to bring someone you can converse with or something to read, its not fast food, so relax."}
{"text":"I have to say that this is our favorite arabic (lebanese style) restaurant in the scottsdale/tempe area.  Food is consistently good - in the several times we've eaten here were were only ever disappointed by a single lentil soup that we ordered and they took it back with no questions.  All of the grilled meat is good as is the baba ganoush and hummus. Falafel is also really excellent."}
{"text":"Found out about Princess Deli at the Gilbert Farmers Market, so glad we did! I love Mediterranean food and this place was a find!! Best Falafel in the valley.  We ordered the Princess combo so we could get a taste of a little of everything. It was so good, each piece of meat was full of flavor and very tender. The serving sizes are very generous. The waitress was having a bad day so I won't judge the service this time.  It's located in a strange place but well worth the drive. They also have a grocery attached and I was able to purchase a fresh made container of Falafel to make a home. One of my new favorites!"}
{"text":"Falafel.  Often mispronounced, misunderstood and mocked.  Why is it so hard to find good falafel in these parts?  Who knows?  We are after all, living in a desert.  Princess Market knows how to do falafel just right.  Not too dark.  Inside still moist.  Perfect balance of seasoning.  Dollop of hummus, lettuce, tomato. And don't get me started on those special little pickles.  I didn't even know until a couple of years ago that they were supposed to even be there!  Lovely.  So run, do not walk, to Princess Market for all the middle eastern treats you crave.  Whether it's stocked on their shelves or served up in the cafe, you will not be disappointed.  And by all means, don't forget your smoked herring from good old Brooklyn, NY.  Bonus!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are regulars here. I prefer it over haji baba hands down. What's not to love - the hummus is amazing (just like I have had in the Middle East) and haven't had a bad meal yet. Everything is fresh and tasty. We love the staff and the family that owns the restaurant. They are always friendly and happy to see us.   We also come to shop here for anything Middle Eastern. If like Lebne you can buy it in the refrigerator section). We also come and just buy a pound of the hummus. It's so much better then the junk you can buy at the grocery store."}
{"text":"Everything that I have eaten here is seriously amazing. I've ordered through postmates about 7 times now. Ah maz ing! Yummy Just ordered again today. There lentil soup is  so yummy!  So happy this place is so close to my work. I couldnt live without"}
{"text":"Service is all over the place.  Inconsistent.  Aloof.  Partial treatment.  One of the young waitresses caters to regulars.  For example, the other day she went out of her way to hand plastic cups to her group of friends and offered to individually pour them water.  Why not treat  all of your customers that way?  I felt like I was in high school again: extremely cliquey.   I've also observed that one of the male workers gave free desserts to a family and a big block of feta cheese to a couple next to us.  Perhaps they were good friends.  But that's irrelevant.  Again, why not hand out free desserts & blocks of feta cheese to all of your customers?  Inconsistent quality of food.  One day my falafel sandwich was amazing - a mind-blowing experience.  But then a month later my falafel sandwich was a dismal disappointment.  There was no plump, well-cooked warm falafel inside of my pita sandwich.  Instead there were tiny bits of cold leftover crumbles of falafel thrown inside a soggy, almost inedible rubbery pita.  I complained to the waitress expecting a brand new falafel wrap to be made.  Instead she came back and handed me a plate of four disproportionately sized falafel; not a single one was in the nice shape of a medium-sized ball - one looked like an elongated, stretched out elephant turd, the other was in the form of a tiny black dot.  Plus it was overly cooked (crispy & burnt).  I'm guessing this was left over scraps from a burnt stove.  She told me to just \"throw it in\" my wrap as she quickly walked away.    What's the point in eating \"good tasting\" food if you're preoccupied with horrible customer service?  You cannot enjoy the food much less digest it properly.  Also, the establishment seems to exude a certain element of Arabic/Lebanese elitism.  Which probably explains the partial treatment of their \"favorite\" customers.  FYI: I strongly encourage you to go to Haji Baba.  Consistent, excellent quality of food and most importantly: impartial treatment & welcoming/friendly customer service."}
{"text":"Ordered the #2chicken shwarma plate and the #9kofta plate to go. Shwarma: perfectly seasoned chicken and rice with garlic sauce, hummus, salad and pita $8.00. Great price and tasted so good. Kofta: meat was cooked to perfection, moist not dry, seasoned nicely. Came with rice, hummus and pita, substituted arab salad for the garden salad. $8.00.   They have great prices, you can eat in the market or take it home. Gyro, fries and soda special for $5.99 and a buffet on Fridays for $9.99.  Yay Amera (Princess)! Ramadan Kareem!"}
{"text":"Awesome gyros! I visited this place and came back for more two times more in about 1 1/2 weeks. The gyros are very good and at $4 you can buy 2. The fries are also very good. I'm bummed that I moved to san tan valley b/c I cannot drive to mesa regularly due to gas prices. But if I lived close by , I would be at Princess every week getting a gyro."}
{"text":"My roommates and I eat here frequently. It's close to home, it tastes good, and it's extremely reasonably priced. Most of their sandwich combos are $6.50 for the sandwich, fries, and a drink. The staff is on top of things. There's nothing to complain about here."}
{"text":"Very clean, inside and outside seating is great. Service very nice and quick . Food looks and tastes really good"}
{"text":"Amazing! The best Mediterranean food I've ever had. I got a gyro plate and my husband had falafel. So good! We loved it. The humus and tabouleh were also excellent. This is going to be our new go to place."}
{"text":"Very good food. Nice service. Their falafel sandwitch is good and their meat shawarma is good too."}
{"text":"This place is best place  to be as adinner Special if you have a family  Because of the variety food they serving And the crew are working there for years They have the experience to get you happy   And your family at the end Iknow the family for year they starving to  Improve the Mediterranean food culture into  The society  Iwould like to thank them for the great food they offering"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat gyros! So delicious, and a really good deal. It's $6.00 for a Gyro, fries, and a drink, and it taste really good.   If you are getting your food to go, make sure you open the fry box, or else the fries will not be crispy when you get home."}
{"text":"Forgot to mention the Prices are great & just had the baklava yummm to die for delicious !"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here a few times and each time the service, and quality food have been excellent.  So far I've had the chicken shawarma and the chicken kabob, both very flavorful.  The hummus and tabouli are also top notch.  I highly recommend this spot.  Almost forgot to mention the baklava was delicious as well."}
{"text":"I came here with some of my family yesterday. This is going to be my new go to for any Mediterranean food or cooking needs. Not only was the food some of the best that I have had in all of AZ the markets selection was amazing. Lots of tea and coffee selections to be had as well as better prices than most grocery stores. Also for the hookah inclined those looking for the best go no further. From Khalil Mamoon's the best hookahs money can buy to AF Shisha. This is going to be a one stop shop for my needs in the valley. Also the owner is very nice and willing to help with any questions from making Turkish Coffee this place has true passion for customer service."}
{"text":"Tried this place out on a whim....and was never disappointed once!! The waitress that served us was extremely attentive and had good conversation. It's been a while since I have been to a Mediterranean restaurant (my favorite was out-of-state) and this is now my favorite above all else in the area!! They were extremely friendly and were very welcoming while celebrating Ramadan. I've already picked out my next selection and can't wait to check out the market section on my next visit!!"}
{"text":"The food is always amazing and service is fast! We love the gyro plate with the hummus (best I've ever had!)"}
{"text":"I must say I was a little skeptical at first. Howevever... They have great food and their garlic sauce is awesome.   Quick pro tip: Instead of the side salad substitute for fries and you won't regret it. I typically stick to the gyro meal or dinner for two and have yet to have a bad experience."}
{"text":"Some of the best middle eastern food in the valley. I'm from Detroit, city with the largest middle eastern community outside the middle east itself so I should know! Yum!  Super sweet peeps running the place too : )"}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food in the area with great service. I have Celiacs and can eat here! Their Lentil soup and Greek salad is delicious. Their coffee is a heavenly treat. My favorite lunch place in the valley!"}
{"text":"Great prices and tasty food! Definitely a go-to for lunch at work. Love the grocery side too."}
{"text":"Best place ever. Best falafel and hummus you will ever find they are super awesome friendly and nice. Love this place my new to go spot."}
{"text":"Food here is great, had the chicken schwarma with salad and rice. My partner had the same with hummus, I heavily endorse eating here. I'm coming back that's for sure. Also they have lovely baklava."}
{"text":"It's not easy finding really good falafel, but Princess nails it! I've yet to find one that is better. The veggie options are comparable to those you find at most middle eastern places (hummus, baba ghanoush, dolmades, etc. - all are very delicious!), but, yes, their falafel is the bomb. The only complaint is that the restaurant portion of the market is a bit lacking in atmosphere, but that doesn't really matter when the food is this good. The servers are friendly too! I've since tried other middle eastern places in Tempe, but they don't compare to Princess!"}
{"text":"So friendly, and a huge selection. You can grocery shop and find unique spices and treats while you wait for your food from the restaurant! Best place for middle eastern supply. Not really any fresh produce, only shelf and frozen, but the quality of the hummus and garlic and falafel, etc. is the absolute best. And they're just so nice! The boys are cute, too! ;)"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy best hummus and kabobs around. Priced excellently for the quality, quantity of products you get there, consistently!"}
{"text":"I'm incredibly impressed by this deli. THE best Mediterranean food I've had in Tempe. The hummus was light, fluffy and scrumptious, and their beef, lamb and chicken platters are my go-to college dinners (and they're healthy!!) Do not hesitate to try their baklava, for it will be one one of the greatest decisions of your day!  The staff is always happy to see me, and have a casual conversation. The store also has a wide variety of groceries to buy! Could spend a good hour or two browsing."}
{"text":"Very good food! love the chiken shawarma..my friend and I came in here for lunch.I even used the yelp offer of free drink and baklava. This place is also a grocery store. I had fun browsing the aisles and ended up buying stuff I wasn't planning on."}
{"text":"When I was attending the Conservatory of Recording Arts at the Tempe campus I would often run next door to Princess during a break to grab a sandwich. These people rock. Super friendly staff, great food, reasonable prices. Highly recommended!! The chicken kabob sandwich is my personal favorite."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!! Great service!! Good prices! My favorite restaurant!!"}
{"text":"The Princess combo for 2 is where it's at, with it's delicious assortment of meats and your choice of perfectly complimentary sides."}
{"text":"I love princess market! The food is always amazing and we have been going here for 4 years and it's still The best arabic food around! My whole family loves their gyros and spicy chicken wings, I personally love the chicken shawarma plate. Their hummus is the best in the valley!! I also love the fact that we can buy some of the unique foods from their market after we finish dinner :)  They have such friendly service and are super quick after u order."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Very authentic cuisine. All homemade and fresh. Falafel amazing. Chicken kabobs delicious. Rice is gluten free!!!  Truly wonderful service. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Always good. One of my favorite places in the area. Online ordering makes it simple and the chicken shawarma or beef shawarma with hummus & pita is solid as are the full dinner entrees with salad, rice & hummus. Kabobs are good. Dina & her crew are friendly and fast! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Quite good food.  Everything was tasty, and I had a full belly when I left,  for about $8."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service! I usually order either the chicken schwarma or the falafel. Both are excellent: very flavorful and never dry. I haven't eaten at the restaurant, I always order take out and they are incredibly quick."}
{"text":"Yesterday we came here and it was buffet day because they are celebrating Ramadan these days. I forgot to take a photo but their soup, meat (chicken, lamb and meat pie), salad and dessert were really delicious. Of course their service is always nice."}
{"text":"Absolutely pleasant.  What a nice quaint restaurant.  Tasty food. The owner is very dedicated to his work and goes out of his way to make sure you're satisfied."}
{"text":"Best food, great service, you can't go wrong with anything you order, plenty of food. The freshly made baklava is to die for! Would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for fresh authentic delicious Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Falafel sandwich, but the Greek salad was ok I've had better. The market has some great spices that I picked up. Will definitely be back. Never would have found without Yelp!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken combo plate which is chicken swarma and a chicken kabob. I usually shy away from kabobs due to the risk of dryness.  This kabob was right on the money. Good flavor.  Babba G was good too.  Nice people.   I think the buffet is popular for $11.99 and starts at noon. I will be back to try the buffet."}
{"text":"Excellent food, felt authentic and the set up was very cool. It was nice to look around the market after a delicious meal. Only reason I'm not giving five stars is because I wish the kabob plate came with more meat for $9."}
{"text":"Iv been coming here on and off for a couple of years so that should tell you what kind of a restaurant it is, you wouldn't come out of your way to come here but if you happen to be closer by and are craving some Arabic/med/greek food then this place is pretty good. Portions are a bit on the small side, which is unusual for the kind of restaurant that it is. What pisses me off is that the don't have unlimited lamb shanks in their buffet anymore, which kinda defeats the purpose of a buffet. Now you can only get one per buffet, and it was the only thing that you could convince your brain to cough up 10 something bucks for the other things are ehh. You're better off ordering something from their menu, the things on there are actually good."}
{"text":"This place is a nice place if you are looking for comfort food. My favorite dish to order is lamb shank in that restaurant. It is always well cooked and tasty. I tried their other dishes too I was never disappointed with any of them."}
{"text":"Oh, this place is fantastic! I love LOVE it! They have the best Friday buffet and the staff is always kind and friendly. Their rice is outstanding, as well as their lamb shank, beef kebab, and baba ghannouge. I keep coming back, and I tell all my friends and family. The market attached to the restaurant is pretty cool, too. We love the miswak (natural Islamic toothbrush) and the halal corned beef. Seriously, wow."}
{"text":"I was really hoping to be a fan of this place. I love that they have a market and a restaurant tethered together. I figured that because of this, there'd be a good chance that their menu items would be fresher than most other places.   I came here once before (for a to-go order) and wasn't all that impressed with the food or service. I figured it may have been an off day and I told myself I'd give them a second chance. Well, as luck would have it, Amazon Restaurants sent me a $20 gift card so I decided to give it another go. All I can say is that I'm glad the meal was practically free.   The chicken was skimpy. The tabouli had hard particles in it which I about cracked a tooth on. There was a spoonful of hummus (like 2 bites worth) and the rice, which was most of the meal, was not edible. The only way I can describe it is that the rice had the same flavor that Subway sandwiches have when they throw them on that black mat in the oven to heat up...you know that pungent chemically scent that tastes as bad as it smells.  I really didn't eat much of anything other than pita bread and tzatziki sauce. The worst part was that I was excited to let my youngest taste baklava for the 1st time. I ordered 4 pieces and got nothing...nada...zero...zilch.   I don't operate on the three strikes rule and there are plenty of Mediterranean joints around the valley to choose from that have better food for the same price."}
{"text":"Delicious and consistently good. The best part is it is very affordable. Falafel sandwich with a side of taziki is my favorite. Workers are super polite and food comes out fast."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years and there is no other place to go for delicious Mediterranean food. I've tried just about every plate they have and they are all on point. When my wife and I come home from a long day of work on Friday nights it is fantastic to pick up some Princess, crack open a bottle of wine and watch a movie.  The spices in the grocery are great too--picked up some sesame seeds tonight for a fifth of the price you would get at a grocery store."}
{"text":"Best falafel in town!  I have been here twice and I really enjoyed it.  Both times, we were given menus promptly and the food arrived quickly.  We tried the falafel entree and the vegetarian combo- the rice, hummus, and baba ghanoush were tasty, but the falafel wins first prize.  They don't use a box mix- they grind the garbanzos and other ingredients fresh- it is evident in the taste.  They also roll the falafel in sesame seeds, which I have never seen before but really loved.  The prices are low and the manager (owner?) is really friendly."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Hands down they have the best falafel in Arizona! This place is super authentic and they serve great food!!!"}
{"text":"This is pretty much the same as Haji Baba. 2/3rds market, 1/3 restaurant. It's not super nice. I'd kinda of relate it to a hole in the wall type of place (which I tend to think have the best food). The service is prompt and nice. The food came right away. I love how they left us alone to talk and didn't rush us out the door. (but they did refill the water and pick up the plates). The gyro plate was good. Not the best I've had, the slices were really thin and not very juicy. The hummus was nice and my friend really enjoyed the falafel. I think it was a little more expensive than haji baba but I was happy :)"}
{"text":"Great Tasting Gyro! And nice family owned place. They have a great kitchen with a nice simple menu. Try there Bbq chicken too. Great food for catering a party, which I have done multiple times. I also love the variety of sweets that are offered. simply a great place to try out, u always have a chance to post ur own reviews, so why not try it out urself."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good not bad in price either. I purchased a gyro sandwich and it was pretty good. Good flavors, a bit dry on the meat and pita. I would come back for another.  Staff: was nice  Store: was interesting to check out a different culture of foods and shopping. Clean place."}
{"text":"Hummus and shwarma both very good...super reasonably priced...good service"}
{"text":"It's hard to please a Lebanese person when it comes to eating this kind of Food because we always compare it to our mom's cooking. This said, sorry mom, but this place is legit! The chicken kabab is great, perfectly marinated and cooked. Tabouli is well balanced. Hummus and Baba are just right. Eat here and you'll be pleased."}
{"text":"I'll admit I'm new to this type of food.  I've ordered the chicken shawarma w tabouleh, rice, hummus and pita five times in a row.  I'm not adventurous enough to switch... yet.   Well, I did try the Arabic salad instead of tabouleh, and it was very good, too.  My daughters love the baklava, but it's not my thing so I can't comment on the taste.  The hummus and pita are just so good.  It seems like a very authentic place, not that I know what authentic is.  :)     The market is very interesting for someone like me who is clueless as to this type of food."}
{"text":"I have been to Princess deli several times because it is really consistent Lebanese food and this restaurant had a groupon for a while. The falafel is really good crispy on the outside and green and soft on the inside. The hummus and lentil soup are both creamy and quite delish."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time today. The chicken shawarma and beef shawarma were excellent, as were the hummus, Arabic salad, rice, and sauces. Our server was very friendly and helpful, and gave us a sample of the pistachio baklava. Everything is made fresh in-house, and everything we had was delicious. The prices are very reasonable. We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I love great Mediterranean food! So, one lazy and boring sunday afternoon I was home alone, with no food in the fridge. I decided to check grub hub to see what delivered in my area (recently moved back in with parents and grubhub / doordash wasn't a thing before I left their place) I got a falafel, Grape leaves, and a Gyro, it was really cheap and at the house within 45minutes. I loved it all. Dragged my entire family to try it out the following day. When we got there I hadn't realized it was a market as well, was able to get some Maltz for desert ^_^ been back about 4 times now service is good, food is excellent always try something new."}
{"text":"I got the chicken shawarma  plate and yup it tastes so good !!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken and beef shawarma. It came with rice, hummus, pita bread, and tabbouleh. The serving size was hearty considering the price. The beef was full of flavor and was juicy. However, I cannot say the same for the chicken. The tabbouleh was so fresh!! It was my favorite part of the dish. The service was awesome...definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Love the princess market! The food is good in the restaurant but I mostly go for the market. Very cheap food! Their prices are amazing and they sell halal meat."}
{"text":"It's very good food ,, I love it and I will come back here every time I come to AZ .. Ppl work here very nice too"}
{"text":"Food was amazing!  I didn't realize there was a separate sit down area and a to go deli part. Ordered at the counter, got food in a styrofoam box and bag. I ended up not eating in the restaurant part.  Nonetheless, the flavors and textures of the food were like nothing I've had before, and I've had Mediterranean and Middle Eastern food before.  The market was nice too. Lots of exotic items I'm not familiar with.  Throughout my time there, all the employees were really friendly!"}
{"text":"Friendly service.  Really good and huge wings. Highly recommend. They charge for ranch. Lol Beef shwarama plate is okay nothing special and I've had better. I think they could improve their portions however. Prices are decent. The lamb kabob was good! Their fries are good. The pistachio baklava is good. Pay at the register."}
{"text":"Great food and service from hyatt! I had the kabob platter. The beef, chicken, and kofta kabobs were all tender and tasty. Sides of hummus and baba ganoush were perfect complements. I didn't have time to check out the market but seems like there are plenty of things to take home as well."}
{"text":"Just ordered from here. A drink was not delivered with our order(but this was just the start of the problems).The food was bland and mediocre. We ordered two sides of pita bread which ended up being two pieces of pita bread cut into 8 and covered in foil. Next we also ordered hummus which is stated to come with pita bread which it did not. Then my \"gyro entree\" came with rice, meat and hummus but no pita bread. Honestly pita bread is one of the cheapest things to make next to rice. What they saved in pita bread will cost them in customers. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great find. I love Mediterranean food and seek it out whenever I can. In town on business and found this on Yelp. I was surprised to find this place as a store and restaurant. But the biggest shocker was the food. OMG was it ever phenomenal. I got the Kabob combo, comes with chicken, beef and Kofta, rice, hummus and salad....all for only $13. The beef blew me away because it was so full of flavor and tender as a filet. I'm happy to put this on one of my all time favorites. Don't let the location or store deter you from experiencing an amazing meal. The staff was very friendly and service was good as well. Go there and enjoy."}
{"text":"I just love mom and pop shops this one is like no other.  I love the food and they accommodate vegan, vegetarian, they also have coconut water I love this little hidden gem.     Also they have authentic desserts that are going to have your mouth watering"}
{"text":"Great food, EXCELLENT service. Gyro - WINNER, Shawarma - WINNER, Pistachio Baklava - Mouth Watering WINNER! And I love that I keep finding delicious, new gluten-free, dairy-free treats!"}
{"text":"Felt like I was back in Jordan. So good. If I lived here I would eat here at least once a week!  Ordered the chicken schwarma. Very tasty. Had fries and the drink with it. Fries were plentiful and hot with good seasoning. Drinks have free refills. Finished with a piece of homemade walnut baklava. Little small but very good. Only a $1.  Service was very nice and attentive. Whole meal was under $10 for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, I am always impressed with the rich flavors and consistent quality of ingredients. I always go with the chicken shawarma plate but they have lots of other good options. I come here 1-2 times a week and I always leave feeling happy and satisfied. Princess Market is close to the top in my list of the best places to eat in Arizona, come try it out"}
{"text":"We went here a couple of weeks ago for lunch, I was hoping to try the lunch buffet.  But it was Ramadan, so the buffet is only available after sunset.  Husband and I shared the Princess Combo ($19),  we picked rice, hummus, and Arabic salad for our sides.  The meat was really good.  The Arabic salad is superb, hummus was good, rice got its color from turmeric instead of saffron.  Other people at the table had the beef kabob combo, and the chicken shawarma.   OMG!  the garlic yogurt sauce was so delicious, I think it only comes with the chicken shawarma.  I can just drink it up  Desserts are $1 each, bite size.  Which is a great way to try all of them! :-)"}
{"text":"This is the BEST Mediterranean food I have had in the Valley!! The grocery store too is awesome and it is a very nice restaurant and very reasonable. The Mixed kabab dinner is amazing! The shwarma and salads and hummus to die for and very very reasonable. You can order a 1/2 order of the $5 salads and they are still big! If you like chai tea try the karak their homemade version ! Open from 9 am-8 pm (store open until 9 pm) so you can try breakfast too! AMAZING really! I lived in the Middle East and not often impressed here with this cuisine like at this place. People here too very nice and accommodating and friendly and glad to explain the more unusual menu items. During Ramadan they (early June-July dates change yearly this year June6-July 5) there is a buffet for a break fast from 7:30-8:30 and is $13 just like the 12-3pm weekly Friday lunch buffet."}
{"text":"I have been coming to princess for about 5 years.. The food is good and fast and affordable and fills you up! I can't see myself eating here though. The setting is odd and I get a weird, \"if you aren't Arabic, go away\" vibe. I am sure this is less then intentional and there is little that can be done about that sort of thing, but i never get that feeling at Haji Baba or any other Arabic restaurant around here... I will continue to pick up from here though - make your menu more concise so you know what  I am talking about when I call in plz."}
{"text":"My bf and I come here frequently. Food is always delicious and they cater to our vegan diets. Neat little market, friendly service and great pricing."}
{"text":"A neighborhood gem! Casual ambience with culinary flair. My husband & I found this place by accident, and we ended up enjoying a memorable meal we hope to repeat soon. We ordered the Princess Combo for two, and everything was scrumptious, perfectly spiced and balanced. Almost nothing remained of the large platter of salad, shawarmas, kabobs and hummus by the time we pushed away from the table. Service was fast and efficient, and the food is well-priced and plentiful. The adjacent market was a great place to walk off some of our dinner while finding hard-to-find Mediterranean/Middle Eastern ingredients for our pantry."}
{"text":"I just happened to stumble upon this place, My first time here. OMG what a hidden gem!  I'm from back east and I haven't been able to find a true middleastern cuisine in quite some time.  Well look no further. This place has it from Real Tahiti sauce to kabobs to hummus and even the salad dressing."}
{"text":"I had the chicken shawarma sandwich along with some saffron rice. They were both excellent.  The flavor of the rice is enhanced by that spice that they sprinkle on it( can't think of the name of it)."}
{"text":"I had their chicken kabob meal and their chicken schwarma meal. I thought that the meat was a little dry but tasty.  I did enjoy the rice, which was quite flavorful. The food was salty overall. I was suppose to have the tabouli with my meal, but they gave me the salad instead."}
{"text":"Found this place on Groupon, was disappointed the groupon wasn't good for lunch AND dinner, but ate there anyway. DELICIOUS! The falafel & hummus are amazing, and the market sells the falafel mix to take home and do it yourself. It's a very very casual place, more of a market than a restaurant, but after eating there you want to go buy groceries and make your own Mediterranean food at home! I bought some cold brew lemon & lime tea that is to die for. Anyway, back to the restaurant- the meat was seasoned and cooked to perfection (they sell the seasoning too) and the rice was - oh heck everything was great! Just go there and try the sampler dinners so you get a little taste of everything!"}
{"text":"Husband and j went for lunch, ordered the princess platter.  It was more than enough food for the both of us, even took some home. Great food and great service. Best Middle Eastern food in Phoenix by far!  Only criticism I have is their Pita was not very fresh, but still good and served warm. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We had the combination plate, along with a couple ordures and more that enough for four people. Hard to choose between the the three meats and two chicken, they were all excellent. The humus, Greek salad and rice were a great compliment to a great dinner. The wait staff were all very pleasant and more than willing to help us amateurs at ordering Greek food. The decor was about average, but the service and food was excellent, we certainly will add this to our restaurant choices, especially when we want some different flavors."}
{"text":"I dig this place.  I have been here SO many times for falafel.  The employees are really friendly (sometimes flirty lol) and the food is so filling!  Great prices and great food.  They even sell henna here!  They regularly cater meetings/events at my school.  This was actually the first restaurant I frequented in the Tempe area.  Their yellow rice, hummus and guava juice are mmm mmm good!"}
{"text":"Haji Baba has competition!   A cozy family run Arabic grocery store attached to a restaurant. There's nothing more motivating for me to go grocery shopping than delicious food that reminds me of home.   The grocery market has everything someone from the middle east might need - bread, drinks, chocolates, spices, clothes etc. Nothing breaks the bank or makes the wallet cry.   The chicken shawarma and the falafel sandwich here are the best I've ever had in Arizona. I'd been on a quest to find a shawarma that tasted close to the mouth-watering ones I used to feast on in the UAE as a child. I'd met my match. It was love at first bite. The shawarma wasn't too runny and it had the right amount of meat and sauces and other fillings. The bread was actual arabic bread and not pita break (never acceptable). The falafel was prepared to perfection.   I promise you that you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food... the employees are SO friendly & welcoming... true, genuine mediterranean meals. The atmosphere is wonderful, as well. Service is consistently great. I would definitely recommend Princess to anyone!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to Phoenix from the Chicago area.  I looked for authentic Mediterranean food that lived up to a high standard set by the many options of the Chicago area.   I discovered Princess, and I now eat lunch here at least twice a month.  Not only is it the best Mediterranean food in the Phoenix area but it has a great environment with lots of character and the owner is personally aware of customer service.  The restaurant is alway clean and the food is excellent.   I read the previous unfavorable review by Sue C. and wondered where this person was eating because the review was complete untrue.  I as well as many of my friends frequent Princess and you should consider that review as invalid.  If you are looking for good affordable Mediterranean food there is no better place to go."}
{"text":"This is an interesting little Mediterranean restaurants / market. The decor is very simple. The market takes up about 2/3rds of the space the remainder for the restaurant. It is rarely very busy so getting a table at lunch is easy. I used to get the Chicken Shawarma but since the buffet was put in I just stick with that. All the meats are halal if that is important to you.   The lunch buffet on Friday and Saturdays is a must, the chicken has some kind of spice that just rocks. I always eat way to much of the chicken. Everyone I have brought here just raves about it.  The buffet is simple with hummus, chopped salad, lamb (I don't eat lamb), chicken, rice, and a couple of other dishes that get rotated. They will also bring hot pita bread upon request.   The only down comment is that the service is kind of slow with drink refills. On numerous occasions I have had to get up and go to the counter to get a refill of water. No fresh brewed iced tea, booo! There is always one guy (the same guy) waiting tables. The food makes up for this."}
{"text":"First time here.  Here's what I think:  Hummus: 5 Babaganoush:   5 Tabouleh:       4.5 Falafel: 5 Grape leaves:  4    (I don't usually eat these but I ate these) Arabic Salad:   4 Kofta Kebab: 5  just delicious with a charry taste    Pita:     3     (can't open them because they are too thin and stick together)  Environment:    3.5 Cleanliness:  5 Service: 5   All of these made for an AMAZING lunch.  I will definitely go back again and again."}
{"text":"Everything I've eaten here has been amazing. It's the best mediterranean food I've had in the valley. Simple ingredients freshly prepared result in rich flavors. The chicken kabob is really good, especially with their garlic/potato sauce. I also ordered the vegetarian combo which is an assortment of the side dishes, nothing was disappointing. The service and prices are also hard to beat.  Dinner for two was under $25 and I left without room in my stomach for anything else."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, the food selection is awesome and the prices are very affordable.  The owners have consistently greeted us with open arms and a great dining experience.  The princess combo for two, was a steal, easily filling up 2 people. The market has a nice variety of international foods as well. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"When I originally moved to Mesa this is the first place I ate at (as it was the first halal restaurant I could find).  The food was delicious.  And the prices were extremely reasonable.  I haven't had the chance to go back but I noticed that they recently started delivering via grub hub, so I may have to check them out again soon!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't find this little gem for years while living nearby.  I assumed they just had a few tables inside the grocery store but there is an adjacent dining room with soft lighting, tables and spacious booth.  Our food was very tasty and fresh and we will definitely return for more meals and perhaps some grocery items."}
{"text":"Very tasty food and massive portions...they were a little backed up so they gave us a complimentary cup of soup...very friendly folks...we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wanting Shawarma for sometime now.  Decided to go to this Market for lunch. Small clean place with a restaurant attached.  Greeted by a young man, who didn't know how to handle a talkative older woman. Full of questions and  needing answers. Went to the back counter and there was the same young man waiting to take my order. He must have flown by me. I didn't see him leave the front counter.  I ordered a Chicken Shawarma and Lentil Soup to go. He made a face of disbelief when I ordered soup. He doesn't know my daughter apartment is like a popsicle.   Got back to my daughter apartment  and the sandwich and soup was okay. It's not memorable and I would go back if I can not find another  Mediterranean restaurant. However,  the store as unique items. That when I am  in Mesa, Arizona. I will go back for spice and Kosher products."}
{"text":"Awesome food, amazing service, sweet hospitable management and employees. Just all around great. Deena and her brothers do an amazing job"}
{"text":"Princess is great if you're in the area and are looking for a quick, really cheap middle-eastern bite. It's a small grocery store with a small counter in the back where you can order snacks, pita sandwiches and cheese and olives. It's also a great place to go for spices, teas and other middle eastern cooking supplies. I come for the Al-Wazah tea, which my Saudi friend always used to make. Also, for lunch (it's not too far from my work) I like getting a mix of grape leaves, falafel and hummus. Their hummus is OK but the baba ganoush is actually pretty good.  They have a lunch buffet, too, but I haven't been adventurous enough to try it, especially since I'm a vegetarian and most of the food seems meaty...  The place is also stocked with hookahs and other things, like calling cards and Quran-alarm clocks."}
{"text":"This is a part grocery store/take out deli/sit down restaurant. They do a really good job of having both a grocery store and a restaurant. They have the space kind of split down the middle with a wall between the grocery store part and kitchen and the sit down area and there's a walk way area where the two intersect. The restaurant side has dimmer lighting, decor and nicer walls. The grocery/take out side is more brightly lit and not decorated. I always come here and order a falafel sandwich to go and it's so so good! They have really friendly staff and are nice about substitutions if you don't like something on a combo platter. Super easy to order vegan here, the falafel sandwich, veggie combo, lentil soup and of course fries are my go to's. They also have yummy olives and in the grocery store they have nut mixes and dates by the lb. Very reasonable prices and authentic food. Mediterranean food is one of my favorite cuisines and this is my favorite spot in the Phoenix area to get mediterranean food. Growing up my mom used to get sheets of baklava here for parties and occasions. I still come here to this day."}
{"text":"This place is excellent every time we come. The food is tasty and the owners have really updated a lot in the restaurant area of the market. The hummus is absolutely my favorite hummus anywhere and the falafel is a must-try. You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Help wanted! Although they don't seem to realize it :( Here's what really matters: the food - always hot, flavorful, consistent. But the service seems to get worse and worse with every visit. We waited almost 30 minutes for our meals with no apologies or explanations; in fact, we appeared to remain invisible at our table after ordering, and again once the food finally arrived. Well ok, that's not entirely true - we were offered soda refills but never received them. This place is definitely worth the trip for good, affordable food in a casual environment, but not if you're in a hurry or are expecting anyone to seem to care about your experience until after you've already eaten. If you're looking for a job as a waiter, however, stop by an apply. Maybe then they'll get the hint!"}
{"text":"Place was awesome, amazing shawarma and they had this garlic sauce that was amazing. This place is also a grocery stores, those are usually the best."}
{"text":"Loved my delicious kofta plate! I will definitely be back and the employees were all very nice and personable!!"}
{"text":"I've now been to a few Mediterranean places that are like this: market on one side and restaurant on the other, and Princess Mediterranean Market & Deli has been my favorite so far! We were greeted when we walked in and every single one of the staff members was really friendly the entire time we were there.  For dinner I got the chicken shawarma entree which is typically what I get at Mediterranean restaurants. The cost for the plate was $9 which included the chicken shawarma, garlic dipping sauce, a choice of three side (either garden salad, rice, arabic salad, hummus, baba ghannouge, tabouleh, or fries), and also pita bread. I chose the garden salad, rice, and hummus. My date got the gyro entree ($8) that came with tzatziki and chose the arabic salad, rice, and hummus.  We both really liked the hummus with pita bread, the rice, and thought both the salads were really good too. I was unable to eat the whole plate of food, but my date helped me out. The price was definitely really fair for what we got. I meant to grab baklava, but forgot. It was only $1 for a piece though ... We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best baclava ever, the staff are great, the food is outstanding."}
{"text":"You're new to this populated desert, left 24 hour fitness and have a huge urge to eat Mediterranean food....Yelp to the rescue!   I didn't really know what to expect from the place. It was 20 minutes before closing and the place is pretty much closing.   Food:  Ordered the Kabob combo to try a mixture of items.  Chicken kabob: Dry chicken because they use chicken breast but packed with flavor. I would suggest chicken thigh meat.  Kofta - Not the best I've had, but no complaints either. Right soft bouncy texture with enough flavor.  Steak - The best one! Came medium rare. Soft and flavorful (same spices as the chicken kabob).  Hummus - Smooth texture.   Service:  They took my order and money with a smile. Not much service necessary at a place like this.   Environment:  Order in a grocery store type counter and pay for it in an actual grocery store counter. You can eat it in the grocery store if you want....awkward Asian guy sitting in the store....no thanks.   Price:  $11.50 for quite a bit of food. I thought it was fairly priced.   Food: 4 Service: 3 Environment: 3  Price: 4"}
{"text":"Completely love everything about Princess Mediterranean Market & Deli from their dine in options to the baklava/namura desserts to take home from the deli area. The lamb shank, falafel, and kabobs were all great meal options. Fortunately our table of 4 got a little bit of everything so we could taste a collection of options offered by Princess. Each platter also came with some very good quality hummus. Their baklava came in 3 varieties in three distinct shapes: pistachio, walnut, and cashew. At $1/piece or $9.99/lb (minimum 12 pieces), I took home a little bit of everything. When I say \"take home,\" I took it all the way back to the Bay Area since I've never seen cashew baklava before. The pistachio baklava seemed the sweetest so I guess it just depends on your personal preference which one to get. When in doubt, just get them all like I did. I don't know how to explain what the namura was exactly like ($1 each or $6.99/lb), but it was a soft slightly sweet pastry with a little bit of coconut flakes inside. I liked the baklava better but the namura was definitely homemade and very unique. Since I've never had namura a before, it's hard to say exactly where it ranks within the namura ladder of quality. All the workers here are very kind and nice people. I will be returning next time I'm in Mesa."}
{"text":"Chicken shwarma, kofta kabob, chicken kabob, spinach pies and light fluffy hummus round out this take out dinner. It held and rewarmed delightfully. We love this place and wish we could go more often."}
{"text":"Found another hidden pocket of goodness- to make you sleep within 7 minutes of finishing your meal!! No kidding! If you're having problems sleeping at night make sure to check this place out for dinner! ;) Your taste buds will enjoy the food and your brain will enjoy its \"powers\" to put you to sleep (like a food coma). But really- the dishes were delectable.   This is in the NE corner if 101-N and Broadway. With the outside sign a bit tattered, this little market still boasts a dining experience to talk about. Staff immediately greeted and asked whether it was dining in or ordering to go and chose to dine in. To the right there were several tables and booths to choose from. Immediately was given menus and asked if ready to order. Waitress was attentive. Chicken shawarma sandwich was around $4 and the kabob combo (kabobs of chicken, beef, and lamb) with rice, salad, hummus and warm pita was about $12. When asking the waitress what kinds if meat was in the combo she said she doesn't know- and just works there. That was odd because I would have thought that if she wasn't knowledgable about what was on the plate that she could have at least asked the other staff. A skilled worker should at least be knowledgable about those basic popular dishes. Maybe in time. Minus that part everything was exceptional. Baklava was super sweet and delicious. Ended up buying a few more baklava to go! Once you're done just check out with the pleasant cashier at the front, and off to get some powerful coffee or to that comfy bed awaiting. ;)"}
{"text":"This place has the greatest chicken kabobs ever, they are never burnt and always super juicy. The marinade is delicious! They say it takes 15 min because they are cooked to order, but I swear I have never waited more than 8 min for it to arrive. A plate comes with 3 sides and is usually always choose tabouli, hummus and baba. It's always served with just enough pita and the plate is filling for $9. It's really hard not to come here every day for lunch.  I crave the tabouli, they make it the best, just a little bit of bulgar wheat and lots of lemon juice and the onions and tomatoes are expertly diced. The service is unbelievably friendly and parking is adequate. The place is super close to asu and mcc so it's a great spot for lunch or study break food. I notice you can also call ahead and order pick up. They grocery also has great products and some fun frozen foods to try. Now if only I could just eat more I'd order the princess platter all for myself!"}
{"text":"This place is our splurge and we definitely place orders a few times a month. Food is nicely priced, and we love being able to come grab our order ourselves and relax on friday nights with a movie or TV show binge with what Princess Market now defines as our comfort food. The falafel meal is our favorite and I can't get enough of Princess's baklava, especially the pistachio. We always order extra pita bread and garlic sauce too. The hummus and rice are near perfection. Honestly we have no complaints, ever, about this place, only praises.   My advice for newcomers, always order yourself the garlic sauce. It's too good to pass up."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  We had a catered order and all our guests raved. We were from out of town and use Yelp for help.  Thanks"}
{"text":"Our meal was fantastic! Stopped in on a recommendation and they did not disappoint!  We sat down and ordered the gyro plate and the chix combo (shawarma & kabab).   The gryo meat was tender, juicy and well seasoned. I love taziki on any gryo I get and here it was very good, but the meat was so good, I caught myself eating it plain or just a touch of taziki. Pita bread was quartered, which may be off-putting to some yet, for us no biggie at all. Salad, rice and hummus were also very good. The chix combo plate scored a thumbs up too. Shawarma was awesome - cooked just right and plenty of flavor. Kabab flavor was spot on however, just a bit over-cooked.  Finally, we took home 2 pieces of walnut baklava - wow! Sweet and crazy good. Portion was on the small side but, get two per person and enjoy!  Service was fast and friendly as well - we are definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Mediterranean restaurant in Tempe. Food is awesome and price is reasonable. Have been coming for a few times and loved the food all the time. Their fries are like best ever! Kebabs are good too."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is amazing, great food, and great service from Ricardo and staff. Noor is cool too!"}
{"text":"So delicious and very affordable! its a market with the kitchen and dinning area located towards the back. Very sweet staff."}
{"text":"I really like this place... the food has been great both times I've been there. The hummus is homemade, the falafel is the BEST that I've EveR had. We tried the chicken wings barbeque, spicy style and they were amawing! Looks like they're building a buffet... will definitely be back to try it!"}
{"text":"Good food and good service. I typically enjoy the chicken shawarma or vegetarian platter. No atmosphere or decor to speak of. Just consistently good food and service at a fair price. Great baklava as well! Many Middle Eastern patrons every time I am there. So, the fair must be authentic as well."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Middle Eastern restaurant. I love the chicken shawarma and the beef kebab. Their platters have a lot of food on them."}
{"text":"I'm a bit of  a Princess when it comes to food...you know...I don't do the greasy man-cave type stuff; fatty meats, etc. So, the first thing that stood out to me here was the Gyro Meat. It's lean, flavorful, and has a nice texture- unlike other places I've dined, even in Scottsdale. They're generous with the Kalamata Olives :) The grilled chicken is amazing...as well as the Shawarma, both beef and chicken. You will have to just let your taste buds experience them. Finally, the Baklava....!!!!  Drumroll please!  Not only do they offer this wonderful treat - but they actually have 3, yes 3 kinds of it! One is even a Lady Finger Style, they are all delish. To top it all, the service is very warm and friendly. Come check them out and bring a friend or two, amazing specials each week."}
{"text":"The best mediterranean restaurant I've ever been to!   It's been only 2 weeks since I moved from LA to Mesa and I'm very happy I found this place close to me. I've been eating there almost every day.   The food is always delicious! It tastes fresh and homemade. Aside from serving great tasting food, the people who work there are always very nice and friendly, making this place my number one choice of restaurant to go to."}
{"text":"We had a special event tonight for an outdoor movie viewing. We were in such a rush we didn't know where to go for a quick bite to eat. We decided to come here to get their chicken and beef Shawarma plates. On our way to the event we called to place a to go order, by the time we got there we only had to wait five minutes to get our order. The food was warm and delicious. It was the perfect addition for movie night, I ended up getting chicken Shawarma with french fries instead of the usual rice because I had my little doggie Patches with me, he ate the fries and enjoyed every last one of them. The chicken Shwarma also came with hummus and tabuli on it.   Update: 3/12/18   I had the beef kabab sandwich. It was delicious! I switched the tahini sauce with taziki sauce instead. Was a great choice!"}
{"text":"Always delicious, fresh, healthy tasting food. The best falafel I've ever had. Very nice staff. Not a super fancy place or upscale experience but it's affordable, delicious and clean."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic middle eastern food! The falafel plate was amazing and the little market is so charming and fun to shop in. The waitress was so funny and genuine. Great little hole in the wall market/restaurant that's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Princess has been a staple of mine since I started at ASU and got tired of what was available on campus. Now, working just a quarter mile away, I eat here for lunch at least once a week.  This place has incredibly fresh, delicious food. I always order the chicken shawarma plate, and have never been disappointed. They use high quality cuts of chicken for the shawarma which is much appreciated! No grisly fat pieces to ruin your plate. Ordering ahead of time via Yelp is also great, but it turns out the pricing is a little higher if you order through Yelp rather than calling the restaurant directly.  We also have used Princess for large catering orders here in the office. In the past, you had to contact the restaurant directly to complete a catering order, which wasn't the most organized, but they have since started catering through EZ-Cater which is awesome and allows for online catering orders."}
{"text":"This is not a \"cute\" and eclectic grocery store the trendy crowd will venture to. It's a very unassuming nuts and bolts Middle Eastern grocery store. This is certainly not a date place. This place is simply for those who want the best falafel in the city. I've been searching all over the valley for an authentic falafel with the green batter. There were two people who ran the store and they barely spoke a word. Despite being quiet, they were polite and friendly. There was plenty of room to sit with many tables. I would not recommend this place for those who are not familiar with Middle Eastern cuisine as this is not really a \"date\" place. However, if you are someone like me and are sick of the faux Middle Eastern/Greek clones and desire the real thing that you would find in a place like Michigan or New York, go here!"}
{"text":"I live in Prescott and was craving Lebanese food. I googled and found Princess market deli, made the drive, it was well worth it! The food was excellent the service outstanding, it most definitely satisfied my craving. I also bought items from their market, great selection at reasonable prices. From now on when I'm in the area this will be my number one selection for Lebanese food."}
{"text":"The food was great. The hummus was so smooth and creamy and along with the chicken was some of the best mid-eastern food I've had in a long time. Plus, we were able to get a coupon on Groupon which gave us $6 worth of food (that's two gyro sandwiches) for the price of $3! I don't care what else you have to say about the restaurant, you can't find even mediocre food for $3 anywhere! As far as looks of the restaurant are concerned, it is very clean. It's very casual and they didn't focus too much on the decor because, yes, it is a supermarket first and foremost. If that is too much of a problem for you, I suggest take out. All I know is, it's good, clean, and worth the trip out there."}
{"text":"This place is great! Small family owned half restaurant half market that has a warm welcoming atmosphere.   Lots of fun flavors, bright colors, and super tasty! I recommend the Princess Combo with rice, tabouleh and hummus. I always mix the rice and tabouleh and eat half the plate then take the other half home.   Don't forget to get some homemade baklava to top it all off, I'm partial to the walnut but they're all great."}
{"text":"I was visiting Tempe and in the mood for Mediterranean food. I chose this spot because of the great prices I saw online. And wow was the food good! This was honestly the best Mediterranean food I've had and it's such a great deal. I ordered a vegetarian play that came with falafel, hummus, tabouleh and baba ganoush. I've never been a big fan of tabouleh but I absolutely loved theirs! And the baklava/other pastries are also amazing. If I'm ever back in Tempe, I will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"I am disappointed to say that the customer is not first nor right at Princess. They have forgotten who keeps them in business, it is paying customers. The buffet last night was horrible...picked over, nothing left and the staff (family) on duty could care less, because THEY ate first!!! When I asked for it to be replenished, their response was, \"Kitchen's closed, sorry. \" This was at 8:15 pm, the buffet started at 7:30!!! I am sorry to say, I will no longer be making the 20 min drive and giving my business to this once great family owned business. Unfortunately the service has diminished greatly with the passing of the owner. He would be ashamed how his staff (family) treated their guests. This has been the 2nd time in as many weeks. Sad...because I really enjoyed the food. I hope they figure it out quickly, because at this pace, they won't be around to carry on the family business."}
{"text":"The worst part about this place is that it's literally at the other end of town from me.  The food is fantastic and incredibly inexpensive."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for lunch. We sat ourselves in a booth. Waitress came by and immediately served us.  Menu prices are awesome, most average around $10 or less per person. I ordered the gyro plate- came with a substantial amount of meat, tzaztki sauce, basmati rice, hummus, salad, and pita bread. While I had a large amount of gyro meat, it was more on the dry side. Would have preferred for it to be a little less dry. Everything else on the plate was delicious! The hummus and the rice were the stars of my lunch. Hummus was creamy and well seasoned. Rice was nice and fluffy, the cucumber salad was excellent as well.  Overall- I would love to try this place out again. The meat was dry, but definitely not inedible as I ate the whole damn thing! It has been at least nine years since I last been here and after today, I plan on returning more frequently."}
{"text":"This place came up in my Yelp feed. I love Mediterranean so we tried it out today.   It is a tiny market with a nice small restaurant area. The restaurant takes up about a third of the space with 8 booths and about 9 scattered tables.   A pleasant young woman greeted us and invited us to sit anywhere. Arabic music played overhead at a reasonable volume, easy to hear but not interfere with conversation. The place was very clean and open.   We had hummus with chicken shawarma, lentil soup, Arabic salad, and Kafta. Everything was fresh and delicious. Prices are excellent.   I finished with Turkish coffee served in a small copper urn with a tiny cup and saucer. Very good."}
{"text":"Princess serves up the tastiest pistachio baklava ever. The phillo pastry is flaky for hours after baking. They use delicious honey and a lovely nut filling that I am not allergic to. Thank you for delivering a baklava that I could enjoy. Warning: Do not over indulge too quickly. Savor the bites because the richness will hit you hard. Being pre-diabetic, I have to watch out that I don't scarf them down. You can purchase one of these tasty morsels for $1.00 each or be a greedy girl like me and take home a minimum of 12 at $9.99 per pound. i carefully shared these precious, golden desserts with my loved ones.  Note: The gyros sandwich wasn't bad, but paled in comparison with the baklava which is worth the hour's drive."}
{"text":"Ordered some shwarma and kabobs to go. The plates were well balanced and tasty. Definitely will eat here again."}
{"text":"Tiny portions and very bland, under seasoned food. Pita was stale and chewy, barely edible."}
{"text":"I was very dissatisfied with service and food as of 4/19/2018 Ordered a gyro! NO sauce, ordered without tomato/lettuce and got it with tomato/lettuce. Sent back and WALKED OUT! Husband didnt get any silverware with his meal! how do you eat rice without fork? Totally dissatisfied with everything!!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and awesome staff! We were curious about trying a different cultural food... and this place was not disappointing. A must try at least once. Gyro sandwich is delicious! Prices are reasonable and portions are good. Try the coconut dessert!"}
{"text":"Classic kebabs, decent shawarma. Hummus great, just needs a little spice. Add some sriracha and you're good to go."}
{"text":"Honestly the best Mediterranean in all of AZ and this is not written flippantly as I've had a lot all over the valley! The food is amazing, the portions are perfect, and the prices are more than fair! Also.... SHOUT OUT TO DEENA!!! This wonderful young woman is an absolute angle and will take great care of you! Great service!!!"}
{"text":"I tried the Friday buffet here with fellow yelpers Rand, Mike, and Robyn. There are just a little over a dozen items but all were really good, and the grilled chicken deserves special mention - it was fantastic, like no other grilled chicken I've tried anywhere else. The other items were mostly standard dishes found in other Mediterranean restaurants, but prepared very well here. Also, each person who partakes of the buffet is served a tender, very nicely seasoned lamb shank - that alone would already justify the price of the whole buffet!  In all it was a really delicious meal, and a really great deal at 10 bucks."}
{"text":"After trying a number of other Mediterranean places and being somewhat disappointed at every turn, I finally managed to find myself in the vicinity of Princess for a weekend lunch. As with many of the best restaurants in the area, the exterior doesn't look like much, but our fortunes changed once we got inside. The waitstaff was courteous and patient with my questions, and although the food took a while to come, it was absolutely worth the wait. I split a side of falafel and the Princess combo with a friend, and both were excellent. One recommendation for those who order platters here: you can switch around the default sides, for example, having tabbouleh instead of garden salad, or baba ganoush instead of rice, and I recommend this. You get a free baklava (or drink) for checking in, and I love the pistachio. When we went, the owner gave us not only this, but a piece of almond baklava, and another dessert to try. Have some turkish coffee to wash it down with, and you're set. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"If you are hungry, this is the place to go, reasonable prices, great sized portions, and the garlic sauce is yummy. Family oriented place. The buffet on friday is quite exceptional. The dinner menu consists shawarmas, kabobs, amazing fresh hummus, falafel and much much more. I would highly recommend coming to eat here whether it be breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Princess market definitely got my vote!"}
{"text":"MMM MMM MMM Thats what i feel about this place. I mean COME ON this is one of the best Arab Food restaurants i think in the WHOLE USA. I know that might be going a bit over board but of all the restaurants i have been to this is the best. I love the Kabob Combo and gyros from there but the best part of the experience is the customer service. Owner is a really nice man and i think his whole family helps out with the shop. :)"}
{"text":"First time having Middle Eastern food, I ordered the veggie platter, which consisted of about 5 different sides. My favorite was the falafel which was crunchy and still warm. The hummus was fresh, along with the Pitas. I also got to try the Asian salad which was really good! For my taste some of the food was a bit too tangy or sour, but other than that it was delicious! The service was good only have two workers not including the cook, so it was a bit slow but they were all nice and courteous.   Ps. If you have a sweet tooth the pistachio Baklava was My favorite thing on the menu!"}
{"text":"You know how when you crave something so badly (in this case shawarma) but then the place you're supposed to get it from takes so long to get it to you that you lose your appetite? Well that's exactly what happened...  Walked in and sat in a nearly empty restaurant with my baby on a Friday night. We ordered drinks -- coke & water -- and by the time our waitress was back with our drinks we knew what we wanted to order, the Princess Combo (chicken & beef kabob, chicken & beef shawarma, rice, salad, and hummus).   Then... we waited, and waited, and waited some more. I even joked and said our waitress forgot to place our order... my man assured me they didn't. After waiting for 30 minutes, we got restless. We almost walked out without even getting our food, but my man asked the waitress, who said \"they were working on it\". Umm. Were they just now running around to catch the chickens in the back? Counting the pieces of rice? What on earth could possibly take so long?!   We told the waitress to just make our order to-go at this point; we were so hungry but we lost our appetite. She finally brought our food out and we were on our way home -- starving and disappointed.   Once we arrived home, we opened up the food -- which in all honesty smelled delicious. The taste? Okay. Nothing spectacular. My man's cooking is way better, more flavorful, and for the $30 we spent at Princess Mediterranean, we could've eaten for a whole week. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I was curious what the hype was all about. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed with the dry chicken shawarma plate which took 30 minutes to show up on my table after the order was placed. The waitress was kind enough to give me some baklava for free to make up for the long wait! but I would seriously re-consider returning to this restaurant during peak hours."}
{"text":"Princess is great! I'm a semi-regular (always take-out) and have tried quite a few things here. Falafel, gyros, tabbouleh and grape leaves are absolutely fantastic. The only complaint I have is in regards to the hummus! I've always found it to be a little bit bland. Some more lemon juice or more spices in general would make it so much better. Regardless, I will be back to this place. It's definitely one of my favorite places to eat in the area."}
{"text":"Yummy!!!  I love good Mediterranean food, and have been looking for a new favorite place since my last one closed.  Have tried many around the east valley, and most of them end up being more of the fast food variety.    This place, however, is fantastic!!!  We got take-out for us last weekend, and it was superb!   The gyro meat was seasoned well and very tender, and the tzatziki sauce was perfect.  The greek salad was fresh and the dressing was tangy and delicious.  They didn't skimp on the kalamata olives or feta, either.  My husband had the beef shawarma, and said it was tender and well flavored.  The baklava was melt-in-your-mouth good, and they have several different flavors, not just your standard walnut.  We had the pistachio.    We are going for round two tonight!"}
{"text":"Still great food... Prices have gone up a bit. Princess combo for 2 is $28 and beef shawarma is up to $5 but still fresh and they know exactly how to make my low carb order- hold the rice and pita and hook it up with extra salad, chopped cucumbers and hummus!!"}
{"text":"I've been living in AZ for 3 years and been looking for good, authentic middle eastern food. I'm from Chicago so my standards are pretty high and this place exceeded them. I had the kabob combo and Labne; they were amazing and the portions were huge! It is very reasonably priced and it was good quality food. I'm so happy I found a place that makes authentic middle eastern food and doesn't bland it down. I will be eating here regularly."}
{"text":"This restaurant is SO good! The people are always so friendly and welcoming. They always help me to decide what to eat and help me because I'm so picky! The chicken shwarma is amazing."}
{"text":"They know their beef. Beef shawarma and kafta kabob were delicious. Hummus was perfectly creamy and flavorful, rice was fluffy. Fries were also seasoned and yummy. Service is great. Very pleasant waitress. Get the princess combo to get a taste of everything!"}
{"text":"Yes! Great food in Tempe! I was super impressed. The hummus is good and so was the gyro I had. Staff was friendly and food came quickly (we were REALLY hungry). I will definitely be begging my friends to take me here the next time I'm in Tempe."}
{"text":"Great food! Had the lamb plate and would order it again. The Turkish coffee was so good I tool a pound home to make for myself. I sure defeats the upscale Scottsdale restaurants that charge too much for the same product. I would frequent this place. The quality and price are could not be beat anywhere else."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! I shared a princess platter with my mother and it was huge And delicious!"}
{"text":"We had a birthday celebration at this place and the food was delicious. We ordered the Princess Combo."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful traditional middle eastern grocery and deli.  The only thing better than the food was our waitress. Beautiful in spirit, compassion, and looks.  Trying to figure out how to fit another visit before we leave on Thursday."}
{"text":"This is definitely my go-to place in the area for shawarma (chicken and beef are both great). The employees are always so nice and welcoming. When picking up the food to-go, I always love to grab something from the little market inside. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This place is the BEST! They have the best & most affordable menu... There is no wrong choice. The hummus & pita bread is always more than an appetizer amount and always perfect. Their entree portions are generous and full of flavor- you can't beat the service, price & quality of the food. And the bonus is the market to purchase whatever you fancy to take home & make. They remember you by name and always have the most timely & generous service."}
{"text":"Wanted Mediterranean...it was late, about 10 min to 8 (when they were scheduled to close). I didn't want to force them to reopen the kitchen, but they insisted we stay...AWESOME start.  The hummus was very creamy and the gyro was loaded and deliciously flavorful. The falafel was overcooked, but the salad (marinated tomatoes) was excellent as was the basmati rice. The waitresses were attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. Overall good first experience."}
{"text":"So it's been awhile since I have been to one of my favorite Mediterranean restaurants but decided to go tonight with a friend. It made me realize why I love love this place! The meat is always cooked to perfection, the flavors are so delicious and the presentation have even gotten prettier with their new plates. We even wandered over to the store they have attached and picked up some groceries. They have amazing prices for everything. Do not leave without trying their pistachio baklava! I had the beef shawarma and my friend the lamb shank...:mmmm"}
{"text":"A very unique and very tasty experience! I ordered the gyro combo for a very affordable 7.50. They gave generous portions of meat, salad, rice, and hummus. What really made this plate \"pop\" was how well everything was seasoned. You can tell that they put great care into everything they cook. Add a friendly waitress and nice, appropriate music music for the perfect atmosphere, and you've got a repeat customer."}
{"text":"How did I not know this place was here?  It reminded me quite a bit of Haji Baba's and I still prefer Haji Baba's.  However, the service was wonderful and the food was good.  My kids ordered a second plate of stuffed grape leaves they liked them so much!"}
{"text":"I've made a handful or more visits there -- it's close to home, the staff are always pleasant (Hamdulila : ) )food always fresh and tasty...mmm shawerma --on my way to pick up my order in a few minutes."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Sooo good. Love the hummus and chicken. And the baba ghanoush. OMG.  Decent service. Nothing over the top, but as expected for a small casual place like this. Personally, I find the booths a bit uncomfortable. If I lived closer I'd definitely just get the food to go instead."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I stuffed myself silly and the kiddos loved it, too! One of the best Mediterranean places in the valley. The market is well stocked, and worth a browse, too!"}
{"text":"Greek salad with chicken was delicious and filled with flavor! The employees are also super friendly and nice and the baklava is AMAZING! So glad I found this spot. :)"}
{"text":"Best food ever!! The falafel is the best in town, crispy outside and nice and moist inside. I also had the chicken shawarma entree, super yummy!! Everything is fresh, great customer service. It's family owned. You can't go wrong with this place at all, a must try!!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the vegetarian entrees (great falafel, hummus, and Arabic salad) and my boyfriend loves both the chicken and beef shawarma. You MUST try the cashew baklava... it is so incredibly good. Goes great with their Turkish coffee.   We have sat in the restaurant and it has always been a great experience.   But seriously, if you get one thing, get the cashew baklava."}
{"text":"Went in for the Princess Platter with my wife and very much enjoyed the meal.  Service was good, we would certainly return"}
{"text":"Been here a few times since. The chicken shawarma is as good as it gets. I like it with french fries, a shawarma isn't complete without fries in my eyes. The fries are awesome on their own - possibly the best I've ever had. There's this red seasoning on them, I don't know if it's seasoning salt or a special in-house seasoning but it makes them even more special."}
{"text":"Friend recommend this place for lunch and I was not disappointed! Got the princess lamb and it was fabulous! Highly recommend the baba ganoush!"}
{"text":"Authentic family ran medi food.  This place is good and has great healthy options.  The hummus is fresh!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this place, and I must say, I was very impressed with the food, both quality and quantity. I tried the gyro deluxe sandwich, the 6 piece falafel plate, and the pistacchio baklava (as recommended by another Yelper in the comments section), and I was not disappointed. The food is just outright delicious! The meat was perfectly cooked, the falafel was amazing, and the baklava just melts inside the mouth. I don't know why I haven't tried out this place before! I will definitely be back to try some other items on their menu. They close pretty early in the evening though (last call for food is around 8:00 PM is what they told me), otherwise I would've planned on dining-in sometime. However, I would definitely recommend this place if you enjoy Mediterranean food (I haven't met anyone who doesn't) :-)"}
{"text":"This place is delicious and so economical! Stuffed grape leaves, falafel, lentil soup, hummus, tea, it's all amazing! We've been here 3 times in the last month!"}
{"text":"In honesty, I feel a little bad about only being able to give Princess three stars.  But this is a perfect example of the fact that to be considered a 'good resturant', even if it is a basic resturant and not fine dining, they can't just throw good food at you and expect return business.  Ambiance and service are important pieces of that overall recipe.  So I'll start with the food.  This place serves the best, most authentic Mediterranean and Arabic food I've ever had.  The food is fantastic.  I'd say that's a pretty across-the-board statement... everything I've tried here is good.  The ambiance:  Flat out poor.  It is a combo ethnic grocery store and restaurant, so that is a pretty big handicap to overcome from the outset.  No real separation from the grocery store,  Seating area is crowded even though there is only seating for about 20 total.  The seating is primarily booths (that wobble and aren't bolted down) that look like they are from a 1980's McDonalds.  There are some cafe-style bar-height tables for two scattered about in addition.  During lunch it will get full enough that there will be poeple standing around, eating wherever they can find a bit of space ( a testament to the good food).  Cleanliness of eating area was marginal.  Service:  Only marginally better than the ambiance.  The servers, although they can handle orders in English, they clearly prefer taking orders in Arabic.  They have at most two people working tables, and often one.  The server is also responsible for running the grocery store cash register, so if 3-4 customers try to check out at the same time from the grocery side during lunch, they'll spend the rest of the meal trying to catch up.  You'll likely have to chase them down for anything except ordering the base meal and getting that brought to the table (and that might require proactive nagging as well).  Cost:  Very affordable for the quality of the food ($9-$12/person).  Runs on par with Spices and other Mediterrean places in the area.  Net:  Not a good place for families, groups, or dates.  Great place for foodies that want cheap, good authentic food."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and really enjoy their chicken shawarma. I'm absolutely in love with their garlic sauce! I ordered the baklava and was really looking forward to it unfortunately, it was very soggy. I'll give it a pass as it was the end of the day and I can't expect pastry to stay crisp after being doused in syrup and sitting for hours. The people working here are always very friendly and polite. I love that it is a store as well and all the items are decently priced. I would go back for sure!"}
{"text":"service for us was very pleasant when she was there which was very little BUT the food is excellent baba ganouch  excellent hummus a little pasty falafal the best gyro perfect dolmathes  yummy as well"}
{"text":"Service poor.. Waited forgot about my drink and when asked her again she acted like I never talked to her. Rice was not good very gritty had better for sure... Meat was good... But over not good experience"}
{"text":"Was very pleased to shop at Princess. Found pretty much everything I was looking for and more. They also assisted me in carrying my stuff to the car which was very kind. Didn't get the chance to eat there and try their food but will definitely give it a shot next time. Definitely recommend the place for Middle Eastern Grocery shopping! And btw, although it says here that their timings are until 8 everyday it's not. It's actually till 9 now everyday except Sunday where they close at 8."}
{"text":"Reminds me of my childhood! The kibbe (balls not patty) is the best I've had in Arizona, I've been to just about every Arab restaurant you can think of out here. I recommend the chicken shawarma, this place made me fall in love with chicken shawarma. The Combo is also unbeatable (two types of a shawarma). I have to say the tabouleh is out of control! Absolutely great spot, with a cool market attached that has an array of hookahs and Arab candy and groceries."}
{"text":"Different; different is good. Set up as a convenience store with a restaurant in the back. Try the Princess Combo; good variety, nice meats. The separate gyro was salty and oddly prepared. Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"Really great food an awesome value because they pack everything I could want from a Mediterranean meal. I have been there three times in the past month. They are honestly the  first restaurant I can recommend to anyone in the past 6 months of living in the valley.   My first tip would be to try the gyro entree with a nice arabic salad, taboulleh (or baba ganoush), and definitely the hummus. Always great food. If you are looking for something less expensive the wraps are amazing."}
{"text":"This place was transplanted directly from the Mediterranean to Mesa! Came during a weekday lunch rush. Staff was extremely warm and helpful. I ordered the fish entree. Food was prepared in about 10 minutes and was extremely tasty and authentic.  It s busy, yet not chaotic or loud. There is plenty of seating space and it is shared with their supermarket. The crowd was a mix of Mediterranean natives and other, giving this place native cred."}
{"text":"The girl that works there is super nice.  Food is pretty good.  :)"}
{"text":"Awesome food, the best I've had of this type for sure.. reasonable price, friendly and helpful staff!"}
{"text":"Found this today. I was in the area looked on yelp for a good place to eat this place came up read most of the reviews saw that everybody loved it went to eat here with my girlfriend. I have to say the food was actually very delicious.   We started with tabouli, stuffed grape leaves, and hummus. They were fabulous.   I had the kebab trio plate with rice Greek salad and hummus it was very good portions are large ended up having to take food home.    My girlfriend had steak kebab with salad and hummus she loved it all.  We ended the lunch with a Turkish coffee if you want a good jolt better than Starbucks end your meal with a Turkish coffee."}
{"text":"This is exactly what I wanted. The people are absolutely lovely."}
{"text":"The best Mediterranean food I have had in Az. The falafel is awesome and the platter can feed 2 or more. The dining space isn't the largest and it is in a grocery store but it's not all about the ambiance especially if the food is done right."}
{"text":"Love this place. Bring a friend or two and share the combo for two (definitely enough for three!) With several meats (beef, lamb, chicken two ways), hummus and a choice of two other sides. Killer!!! We come here often for work lunches."}
{"text":"Have yet to order anything here that didn't exceed my expectations.  Easily the best baklava I've ever had."}
{"text":"It's about time i got this review posted considering I have been eating lunch here at least once a week since I was told how close to work this was.  The food here is really good and fresh. I am a huge fan of middle eastern cuisine and I was surprised they had one of my favorites, kafta, on the menu. The kofta here is great it gets a nice light char from the grill on the outside but is still juicy and tender on the inside. I love it. The fact that the platter is only $8 and comes with rice, hummus and salad is a deal I can't pass up.  Those who know me know that I am picky on what hummus I enjoy since i have been making my own for almost 20 years. The hummus here is the rare exception to my normal rule that I don't like the super smooth and creamy hummus. I am not sure what exactly it is but I like it here.  For lunch I usually get the tabouli instead of the salad as my second side. It's really fresh and has a nice bite to it. I usually mix it with some hummus and apply to pita bread as the flavors work well together.  As for other things on the menu I have sampled most of their range of baklava thanks to the great yelp check in deal they had. I really liked the walnut but usually I will just look into the case and point at whatever looks good. That plan hasn't left me disappointed yet so I think I will stick with it. For entree's the chicken shwarma is my second favorite, the garlic sauce really makes this dish; the beef shawarma is pretty tasty but I have a hard time passing over the chicken for this one.  The staff is friendly and I can't find a negative thing to say about this place. Check it out and you will be happy you did."}
{"text":"Only gave it 4 stars NOT because of the food because it was 'incredible'Just wish it was nicer inside broken floor tiles ect . Staff was very friendly place seemed to be clean. As I sad food was great ."}
{"text":"Before I get to the food, etc. I made an observation here that was quite disturbing from an infection control perspective. The young woman wiping down the tables was using the same rag to wipe both table tops and seats without even rinsing the rag between surfaces. Ideally, she should have two separate rags--one for table tops and one for seats. The thought of smearing e. coli from the seats onto the eating surface was creepy.   This is a hybrid grocery store and sit-down restaurant. The decor is sparse and be careful when walking in the dining area for unlevel surfaces (a mix of vinyl and ceramic tile making for different height walking surfaces). When I entered I was told to sit anywhere. The only two booths that were open had crumbs and food debris on both the table and seat (but once I saw how these surfaces are cleaned, I was just as happy to not have these surfaces \"cleaned\").  I had the chicken kabob sandwich ($4.50) and it had plenty of grilled chicken, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and tahini sauce in a soft pita. It was tasty. I also got some very good walnut baklava to go ($7.99 per pound). The server drops the check at your table and you pay at the cash register as you leave. A single cash register handles both the grocery and restaurant portions of the business.  Parking is very tight and the parking lot is laid out weird, so careful backing up. Would I go here again? The food was tasty and reasonably priced (4 stars), but I don't think I can handle the thought of eating off a surface that been \"cleaned\" with the same rag used to clean the places where people park their buttocks (minus 2 stars)."}
{"text":"We discovered Princess Mediterranean via Groupon, and became devoted fans from our first dinner experience. PM is a combo restaurant-grocery, and there is plenty for everyone to go around.  First, the restaurant. Bring a friend or two and on your first visit try the Princess Combo, which could easily satisfy three hungry diners. It comes with delicious chicken kabab, beef kabab, kofta kabab, chicken shawarma, and beef shawarma -- all of which you can order off the menu, as well. The toughest part is selecting your sides. The Arabic salad is my favorite, but the hummus and other options are delicious too. The service is super-friendly and if you go more than once, you're likely to be remembered. If there is any room for improvement, the iced tea (another addiction of ours) could use a little work -- but the food is so incredibly delicious (emphasis on INCREDIBLE!), it's a minor afterthought.  As for the grocery, there are countless treats to be found here, from spices to candies to foodstuffs guaranteed to make your mouth water. However, before you go pay your bill at the register, a MUST-DO is the baklava and namura (coconut cake) counter in the back. It's just about the very best I've ever, ever tasted -- and these sweet treats alone might keep you coming back again and again and again.  If Yelp allowed a 6-star rating, PM would get it from me. Go. Go now. You deserve it!"}
{"text":"Food is great! Service is awesome! Got the princess combo for 2 soooo yum... I ll be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I feel that the reviews on here are overrated. \"Best falafel in town\" my *ss!   First, let's talk food. I'm not new to Mediterranean food. However, this was my first attempt at eating falafel. Here it's horrible. Tasteless even with the sauce. Burnt on the edges. I have since had falafel elsewhere convinced it was good because I understand the Greeks and Hebrews eat it like popcorn and I have found places with great falafel, just not here as the other rave reviews would suggest. BUT they have great Adas soup. It was really spicy in a good way and nice and creamy. So I can't explain the falafel failure. Overpriced for what you get. I had to eat off my husband's plate to get full. They do bring OK pita bread out to you.   As far as atmosphere goes, it's lacking a bit. This place is (as somebody wrote) 2/3 market, 1/3 restaurant. They have a sign in the window that says \"Allah\" and \"Mohammed\", which I don't think is a good idea. There is definitely NOT outdoor seating as the stats indicate. The tables are the cheap fold-up kind and so are the chairs. The tables are chipped. The waiters serve in a timely manner but don't smile like they would at a chain. They do have a big screen TV that was playing a soccer game but at least the volume was low.   I can't recommend this place for a date or for families. It's just mediocre."}
{"text":"The food is great and you can't beat the price!  The service was out of this world.  If you are looking for medeteranian food this is the place to go!  Don't bother with the big box stores it's not the same as a restaurant in the back of a grocery store."}
{"text":"First time customer. I have driven past for many years, and I have to admit, I've been missing out.   I just grabbed a gyro for lunch, and I must say, this is one delicious gyro. I'd definitely put this one in a tie for the top 3 I've had. I've been to various places around the valley, my ex-wife was greek, and you may think a gyro is a gyro is a gyro, but that's not true.   I won't say that other places \"disappointed\" me, but there was nothing special about them. This gyro, that I'm actually eating while typing this, is a gyro done well and done right.   The flavor profile is great, all of the ingredients really shine together and the taste comes alive in your mouth.  As I said, first time here, haven't tried anything else so I can't speak on that, but if you want a gyro, a good gyro, one where you won't just be like, \"well, it was good but blah, nothing special\", get a gyro here.  If the other food is at the same level as this gyro, and I have no reason to think otherwise, this place is a real gem.  Don't make the same mistake I have done and keep driving by, make an intentional effort to stop in, and you will not be disappointed.  My compliments to the chef."}
{"text":"The shawarma is great but I really went for the fries they're gorgeous and delicious."}
{"text":"The food here is phenomenal, and the people are friendly and cool. My favorite is the chicken shawarma plate...the rice is so flavorful (and I don't even eat rice!) and they have this garlic sauce...to die for!!! It takes a few minutes to get your food to go because it does have a restaurant side, and they make it fresh as you order it, but it's totally worth it! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I have been in this town for a short time this has become my place for Gyros and other meals also, the food is great and the service is fantastic very little wait time."}
{"text":"I love this place! Family owned, service is great. The food here is genuine mediterranean. The hummus is the best I've found here in the Valley!"}
{"text":"This place is freaking awesome! I have tried just about everything on the menu and it's all very yum. I normally get the beef kabob plate with rice and hummus. The beef is perfectly seasoned and, with just a little hint of pink in the middle, it is perfectly cooked as well.   Besides the food being amazing the service is exceptional. You can tell that the owner works his butt off and it shows.  Oh and the falafel is amazing too!"}
{"text":"Decent food.  Great prices.  I ordered the baba ghannouge (eggplant dip) and lamb shank.  Decent offerings."}
{"text":"The food at this place is amazing.  There is no reason they shouldn't have 5 stars.   This is the best middle eastern food I've ever eaten.   I strongly recommend giving this place a try.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Almost easy to miss, in a strip mall right before the 101 freeway.  Dining area is clean, staff is very friendly. We ordered the princess combo which comes with chicken shawerma, beef shawerma, chicken and beef kabob, rice, hummus and salad. All the meat was very good, cooked to perfection and seasoned perfectly. Hummus was excellent. We also tried the falafel which I loved, perfect recipe and cooked perfectly. There's a market inside so you can shop after you eat. All in all, it was a great lunch experience."}
{"text":"Amazing food I highly recommend it to anyone. The staff is super nice and the service is great.  Try the beef shawarma"}
{"text":"Good Prices, Good Food and Tasty Baclava!  $4.50 Shawarma sandwiches and 9.99 baklava trays make this an awesome new find for tasty and affordable eating!  Easy parking and easy location right off the 101 freeway and just east on broadway road make for simple transportation!  This will be a new favorite for sure!"}
{"text":"Amazing Mediterranean food in an understated building. Great hummus and pita and chicken shawarma. Definitely go here!"}
{"text":"My roommate introduced me to this restaurant and I'm so glad that she did! I get the meat combo every time I go. {however I have it modified and ask for two steak and one chicken skewer, because the steak one is my fav :)} I love the Arabic Salad and even their regular garden salad is super yummy and fresh. The desserts are great too! I would highly recommended it, even if its not your usual place just give it a try. It for sure wasn't my usual place but thanks to my roommate I tried it and now love it. Very friendly staff as well!  OH GREAT pita bread!"}
{"text":"I love Lebanese food and this is a very good place!  I ordered the Chicken Kebab plate with Tabouli and all was delicious.  The chicken came out in large chunks and was moist and very tasty, seasoned perfectly. It was charred slightly and juicy inside.  The rice was perfect too.  It was cooked to perfection (light and fluffy) and seasoned slightly with Turmeric which was wonderful.  The tabouli was spot on and did not have to much bulgur wheat in it.  It was a huge portion and loaded with all the right ingredients.  The staff here are very friendly and make sure you enjoy your experience and it shows due to the Yelp reviews!  Check them out if your are in the mood for great Lebanese food, or just want to give it a try for the first time, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Amazing food.  I had the chicken shawarma platter and two pistachio baklava for desert.  Thank you to Mario for introducing me to this fantastic family run restaurant!"}
{"text":"Awesome, authentic, and not pricey! I always go here for the falafel pita... Bomb! Their pistachio baklava is easily the best in Phoenix. A must try!"}
{"text":"This place is attached to a deli and the atmosphere is comfortable. The place was slow when I was there but I arrived on an off night and fairly late. The service was good. I asked for a change from the regular menu and they gladly accommodated.   Overall the food was very good. The chicken kabob was well cooked and not too dry. The hummus is fairly high in tahini and it is very creamy. The salad and dressing were crisp with no sign of spoilage in the lettuce. The tabbouleh was good but was probably much better earlier in the day. The pita was the weakest item I had but I don't eat much bread so that was fine.   Prices were very reasonable. I marked them down one star for the pita and slightly wilting tabbouleh but I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"After following this place on Instagram and drooling over falafel pics I decided to finally make the trip to Mesa to Princess Mediterranean Market. I am sure glad I did! This place was a little tough to find, you can't see it from the street and Google maps definitely steered me wrong haha. But it wasn't too bad! It almost seems like a gas station type place when you walk in, there was like no one there when we went! The little market area seemed cool and I hope to go back to pick out some new ingredients to try! The restaurant part was nice! Empty on a Friday night. We were helped right away. There was a lot of options on the menu, good vegetarian ones too! And the best part was that prices are low. Very few places you can go and get great authentic food for such reasonable prices. For my meal I ended up getting the falafel entree with rice, pita, hummus, and Arabic(I think?) salad. They have good options for sides too! The falafel was some of the best falafel I've had. The spices were perfect and it was nice and crunchy without being too dry or too oily. The hummus was delicious as well. The salad part was surprisingly awesome as well, it was a simple salad, but it was very good with all of the other food on my plate. It was a lot of food for $8 and kept me full for sure! I look forward to coming back and getting more tasty falafel."}
{"text":"Been here many times. I have not been disappointed yet. I also love the fact that I can get a half pound of olives while I eat my meal. I've always been treated well there."}
{"text":"No. Im sorry but this was pretty bad. Located in a shopping center and its in the back of the store( not a bad thing, just giving backdrop). The food was cold. Salad was horrible rice was hard and the dressing was gross."}
{"text":"This place has affordable and very delicious meats and food! Their service is fast and very honest people that work here. I love their lamb shanks!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on a friends recommendation.  Delicious food!  We split the hummus with gyro and the Arabic salad.  We also samples all three baklava flavors.  I will be back to try more menu items!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty alright, taste wise. We ordered dolmades, a gyro entree, a gyro wrap combo, hummus deluxe, and two extra sides of pita bread through DoorDash. I did not receive the drink that was supposed to come with my combo- not sure if this was Door Dashes fault or the restaurants. Also when someone orders hummus, you'd usually expect it to come with pita like the website says it does. We got maybe 8 quartered pita slices, so like 2 whole pita breads, which is pretty disappointing when you're trying to eat hummus both with the gyro entree (meat and hummus) and an entire appetizer of hummus between 2 people. I spent 40+$ on this meal but it was worth more like 20$ because of the overall \"meh\" factor."}
{"text":"You will love this place, best food ever. They have a lot of options, including a buffet; so basically anything you are in the mood for you will find,"}
{"text":"the husband got me take out from Princess.  I ordered the chicken shawarma platter - the chicken was well seasoned, the garlic sauce was really great, but wish i had more! The hummus was good, BUT they forgot my pita.  Hard to enjoy hummus with nothing to eat it with.   I also tried the pistachio baklava... it was alright. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Buffet only on Friday!! And today is Wednesday :*(  I went based on other yelp reviews, and it was pretty good.  Not gourmet or anything, and it is a grocery store, but I tend to like this sort of thing and feel more at home, like you're at someone's house at the table in the kitchen.  I got the gyro plate with a few salads on the side.  It's reasonably priced and they serve it with warm pita bread.  Next time I will ask for more salads and less meat (just my personal preference), but everything was tasty. And the tsatziki sauce was yum yum yum.  I'll come back on Friday and check out the buffet.  (Only 12-4!)"}
{"text":"Friday's they have a buffet!!! It was amazing!!! Love this place! So fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Very tasty, perfect portions, and reasonable prices  Next time I'll order ahead and not wait Will be coming back soon for my falafel sandwich!! Yum!"}
{"text":"An absolute gem in the desert. Very friendly staff, great food and an awesome marker where you can get all sorts of tasty food. The had the beef shawarma and it came with hummus, rice and Tabbouleh, a garden salad or an Arabic salad... Every thing was awesome. Will go back very soon"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for kebabs. All of them are good, even the kofta (ground beef) because they're usually dry. But here they manage to make it moist and all of the kebabs have a perfect smoky char. The rice is delicious, the mediterranean salad (mix of small-diced tomatoes, onion, I think cucumber, etc. in a light dressing with herbs) is perfect with it. Their baba ghanoush is my favorite I've ever had, fresh and slightly smoky.  It's a relatively small seating area, around 15 tables and booths, in the same space as a middle eastern market, so don't expect glamor. But that's not why you come to a place like this. When I want kebabs, this is the place I think to pay a visit."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and found the food really good, but today not so much.  The Pita bread was dried out and cracked on both of our Gyros and the chicken wrap was not as good as I remembered.  Sad face."}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was younger with my family and it has always been a treat. Cheap, affordable Mediterranean food that tastes great! Any meat option is fantastic, though the schwarma and beef kabobs are definitely standouts. The market is also a great place to buy foreign items."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Princess platter tastes amazing and is a great deal. First time going here and I can say for sure I'll be coming back. Best part was the service. They were so friendly and treated us like royalty. Desert on the house, pistachio baklava; which was to die for. I enjoyed my baklava with some Turkish coffee, great combo. Yum. The market place was fun too, I bought some henna, can't wait to try it out. This place is definitely a new hidden gem of mine."}
{"text":"If you like great food and great prices, you'll love this place.  It would be hard to recommend one dish because I've eaten here enough to sample just about everything on the menu and it's all good. Not sure what it is about the combination of foods, but I feel satisfied for hours after a combo plate with hummus, rice and tabouli.  Go - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the spot! It's become difficult to drive down the 101 without stopping off for a quick gyro and hummus to go! Everything tastes so fresh and is made with the kind of authentic home-cooked middle eastern taste that I've learned to expect. The \"main guy\" running the shop isn't much of a talker but his honesty is refreshing. And as long as the food keeps tasting amazing at the price remains so reasonable, I'm a patron for life. OOooo and don't forget to try the freshly made baklava! I took a tray into my office last week because I was so excited to share my newfound discovery."}
{"text":"Husband and I absolutely love the food here. The meats are tender and well-flavored and the hummus and baba ganoush are always amazing.   Don't forget to try their baklava! My favorites are the cashew and the pistachio. SO GOOD. We always make it a point to bring friends from out of town here. Love that they have a small market with lots of international sweets and food available.   They also have a buffet lunch on Fridays ($11)!"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend because he dragged me to. At first I wasn't looking forward to this because I am not a meat lover and I do not like change.  I ordered the beef and lamb gyro and was nervous about if I was going to like it. Come to find out.., it was the best gyro I have ever had. The pita and hummus were fresh and tasted delicious as well. The gyro was well cooked with tons of yummy flavors and was so fresh. Maybe I will start trusting my boyfriend more ;)"}
{"text":"Been going here for 10 years, I mostly stick with the chicken shawarma combo and its always great.  The hummus is good too.  Prices are good and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"We stopped in after seeing the sign on the road about Princess Mediterranean, Gyro etc.   We circled the parking lot twice to see if anyone was in there.  This is not our area of town, we were there shopping nearby.  Anyway, you walk into a nice market, then turn right and there is a good size area for full service dining.  We ordered the chicken shwarma and another meat sandwich (boyfriend ordered it, can't remember the name).  They were both delicious.  The service was incredibly friendly and welcoming.  You think it's just a store at first then turn right and it's full service dining.  We got a free baklava which tasted sooo soo good. It was fun to shop around after eating as well, many spices and new things to see.  I would eat there again for sure.  Our waitress was super nice and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"This place is great!! If you want a very casual, friendly atmosphere, this is the place for you! If you loved your meal, and wish you could bring some of their fantastic hummus, salad dressing, or other Mediterranean delight, you can purchase it at the Deli! There is also a small Market, that is wonderful! Authentic music and atmosphere! A++"}
{"text":"The hummus was delicious and the pistachio balaclava as well. The chicken kebab was ok but a little on the dry side. There was enough food for 3 people, the portions were huge! Overall, I would come back again."}
{"text":"Ordered thru Yelp for pickup and it was all ready to go 10 minutes after I ordered. Very friendly staff. As for the food, very good authentic dishes. I try all kinds of hummus and theirs had great texture and flavor! Also had the fatoosh salad which was excellent. Definitely recommend and will be returning plenty of times."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. The food is always fresh and full of flavor. You can find a lot of great food items in their store. Olives and feta cheese are always fresh!"}
{"text":"Everything was yummy and fresh. If you are a middle eastern food fan it compares well to Middle Eastern bakery and some of the other local places. I really liked the fresh flavors of everything that we had. My wife and I ordered a platter and a hummus plate, more than enough food for two for dinner with leftovers for the next day.   This was a good 25 min drive from my house but I would definitely do it again."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome chicken kabob sandwich they have here! Was on my way to work, ordered pickup beforehand but decided to enjoy my lunch at the seating they had outside. Friendly staff and food is amazingly delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious Mid-East cuisine inside of a ethnic grocery/market. Smelled amazing and tasted even better. Got the chicken and beef shawarma combo that included rice, hummus, and pita bread with a small Greek salad. Also ordered a side of beef sambusa. The sambusa were made more like egg rolls with a slight spicey note and they came with a yoghurt dipping sauce. Everything was delicious! The only thing is I wish there was more pita included - we had two full shawarma orders that had the hummus but only got maybe 2-3 pitas - and it wasn't cut inside triangles. I would definitely come back in and/or get take-out."}
{"text":"I enjoy eating here every time. I love the kabob combo and the salad is so delicious!"}
{"text":"This place has superb food at great prices. I highly recommend - over most restaurants in the valley. You can't go wrong here.  Although very casual (set amongst grocery and deli) it's worth trying.  When I'm super busy, this is my go-to take out place."}
{"text":"This is the best Mediterranean food in Arizona hands down. I'm very open about eating places and trying new things but I've given up on trying Mediterranean food anywhere else because it's always simply just not as good as Princess. I usually order the falafel plate with tabouleh, rice, and hummus. It comes out with pita bread. I also order lentil soup (always with lemon!!!). And then I end my perfect meal with a pistachio baklava and a Turkish coffee. I love this place. Definitely recommend. One of my favorite restaurants here. The good is consistently delicious."}
{"text":"First visit today for an early dinner with the wife.Had the falafel and the babaganoosh for an app,and chicken swarma plate for an entree.The wife had the kofta plate for dinner.The swarma w/garlic sauce was fantastic and the falafel was the best I've had anywhere.A nice quiet place to eat with a nice market.Thanks to Sam for making our visit very enjoyable."}
{"text":"I've been familiar with Princess for a while now and have tried their food at various events throughout the years but today was the first time I dined in. My brother comes here on a frequent basis so I decided to meet him for lunch. There was plenty of parking when I came around noon and several open tables. I knew I wanted to order the chicken shawarma wrap since that's my standard when I go to Middle Eastern restaurants.   The sandwich was only $4.50 and it was flavorful, I asked for Sriracha sauce and that added a nice spicy kick to it. Service was quick and friendly and the grocery store sells a variety of items as well. I'd definitely come back and try their plates and desserts when I have more time."}
{"text":"For restaurant 1. Food = 4 (food is fresh and good quality). Not a fan of lunch buffet. 2. Service = 4 3. Atmosphere = 3 4. Cleanliness = 3.5 (quite ok considering the rush and crowd they are handling) 5. Pricing = 4 (Looking at the taste, variety and service; the items are well priced)  For grocery 1. Good collection of middle eastern stuff. 2. Halal meat is available too.  Overall a good local restaurant"}
{"text":"We had an awesome first experience. Not knowing how everything works here (it's both a grocery store and restaurant) we went to the counter and placed our order. The guy taking our order recommended the shawarma s we ordered the gyro and beef shawarma plates. We got so much food and all was amazing. The meat was delicious and super flavorful, and the rice was well cooked and really light. The fresh hummus was the best part by far however.   The workers were very attentive to us and made sure we were having a good experience. They even brought out a little baklava dessert for both of us (seems like they do that a lot), but it was great and a nice touch.  We walked through the market afterwards and found some cool things to take home and try! We will be coming back and trying more of the menu in the future for sure!"}
{"text":"I have a lot to say about this place but I will keep it short. I guess I like princesses. I liked the food that tastes very fresh. I loved the chicken shawarma which was all white meat with a great light citrus flavor. I loved the ice cold can of diet coke. The perfectly warmed pita bread. The fact that plates come with a choice of three sides. The market had a very wide variety of interesting things I want to try. I even enjoyed the music. But the best was the sweat Mexican waitress who made sure everything was perfect. Very impressive first experience."}
{"text":"Given its close proximity to Haji Baba, I don't see any circumstances where I would go here instead. Their menu basically looks identical to Haji Baba's, just with an additional dollar tacked on to every item. In fact, it might even be under the same management. I even think Haji Baba's food tastes better, but that may just be a mental thing because it's a better value to me as it is cheaper.   Moral of the story is, if you want middle eastern food, this is a good spot, but Haji Baba is not far away and it's better and you won't spend as much money."}
{"text":"The review is for the restaurant only. We went there couple of times, and the place was reasonably crowded. We ate Kabob combo, Greek fries and Pistachio Baklava. Everything was great! We really enjoyed eating and made it our go-to place for Kabobs. Recommended!!"}
{"text":"Great beef kabob, kibbi, beef shwarma, and chicken shwarma.  Rice had nice flavor, and Arabic salad was excellent. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I liked the taste though the amount of the food, and their service weren't as expected! They also charged us for extra bread beside rice which was weird to me."}
{"text":"It was our first time here and the food was amazing!  The fact that the restaurant only uses halal meat is a big part of that!  We had the Princess platter and the beef shawarma was outstanding! The people who work there are super friendly and are willing to help you figure out what to have.  We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"So after going to Flaming Kabob multiple times and having to wait 2 hours for lunch service..and trying Raina's and there food being alright...we figured a new place was in order.   Very happy with what we got there.  It was a little different as it is set up as a market, however they directed us to sit at tables and eat.  Arlano was our server and he was very nice.  I got the chicken schwarma plate with hummus, rice and salad.  All was delicious.  My friend got the chicken schwarma salad and loved the way the meat was seasoned.    Altogether food and service were great and Arlano even took the time to introduce himself to us and get our names on the way out!  Very personable service.   Will return and probably not hit up the other places anymore."}
{"text":"We stopped here after some business in Mesa.  We were looking for a snack, Yelped it, and boom.  Mediterranean it was.  Had falafel sandwiches which were AWESOME.  Fresh, crispy falafel (not warmed over) in homemade pita bread. Perfect size.  I eyed the buffet and other offerings.  It all looked and smelled great.  Awesome specialty grocery items.  Don't be intimidated or put off by the looks.  It's a DELI not a high dining experience.  And it is a great deli.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I've been to another restaurant similar to this is the same part of town and had been a little let down. So when I found out about Princess I knew I had to try it and GOSH was it amazing!  I ordered the shwarma platter with rice, hummus, & baba ganoush and every but was amazing. Nothing was dry and it was all full of flavor.   The guy that assisted me was really friendly & genuine. I picked up some baklava to go since the other yelpers have raved about it. Based on everything else i'm sure they'll be delicious. I made plans to come back with some friends before I even paid my bill. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love little spots like this! They have delicious authentic Mediterranean food. The staff is very attentive and friendly. They also have a little market inside where you can do some shopping. I've been here before and will continue to come when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent middle eastern food! Have had a quick lunch there and also had food ordered for a party - excellent always!  The chicken shawarma is really the best bet! Tabouli is great! While the set up is a grocery store with a restaurant, I think it serves my purpose really well. I place the order and while it's being made ready, I stock up on the International groceries that I need  Multitasking at its best"}
{"text":"This is one my favorite restaurants in Maricopa County.  The staff is always friendly, the food isn't overpriced, and we keep coming back."}
{"text":"All their food is awesome, I typically get the Chicken Shawarma plate with hummus, Arabic salad, and tabbouleh. They portions are more than plenty as I usually eat half for lunch and then half as an afternoon snack. All the staff is polite and courteous. As far as dining in they could use a little help but when it comes to the food it is top notch."}
{"text":"Best hummus in town, hands down.  Plus I think the owner is extremely handsome ;)...................."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, and cool environment. They had all my favorites: chai, shawarma, Turkish coffee, and baklava! Would definitely go back again and can't wait to do so. Also, the grocery store has so much authentic Arabic foods, spices, and drinks!"}
{"text":"Our family is obsessed with their hummus.  It wins \"best of\" awards, and one taste of it and you'll know why.  I've tasted hummus around the world, and nothing beats this.  When my sons come home from college with their huge appetites, they want at least one meal from Princess Market.  I often call them to cater events.  They offer dine-in, take-out and delivery.  We live close by and enjoy walking here and eating in.  Our favorite meals are grilled chicken, chicken shawarma plates and the gyros plate or salad.  It's fun to browse and shop while waiting, and they're always friendly.  The owners are really good people.  Food is healthy, fresh, carefully-made and always delicious.  You can't beat the prices, either!  Hands-down, our favorite local restaurant."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mediterranean food. Gyro plate was delicious!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time the other day and tried the gyro plate my son ordered the beef shawarma. Everything was good and the staff was very friendly and even gave us a sample of baklava. They give you a lot of food for cheap prices. I will be back."}
{"text":"The buffet was really delicious, lots of different tasty meats.  The guava juice and baklava were also delicious.  A good meal at a good price.  For the buffet, make sure you get there early since it gets busy quick!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Great customer service and even better food! Very authentic and delicious. Best falafel I have ever had, hands down.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Love princess market for their food and market. Love the sandwiches and my husband and I often get the princess combo for two and always have leftovers for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"The food here is incredibly good & you cannot beat the price. I can't believe that we just found this place! They have been in business for over 13 years & somehow we just kept missing it. But now that we have found it we are in falafel heaven!!!"}
{"text":"Deserve more than 5-stars. My regular place to have my food. Still very delicious!!! (But please don't increase the prices)"}
{"text":"The food here is great, and a very reasonable price. The service is fast and everything tastes relatively fresh. I love getting the chicken shawarma and/or the gyro meat! Yum."}
{"text":"This is a hole-in-the-wall type restaurant. Its part of a market/grocery store as everyone else has already noted. Its a little hidden, and I think that hurts this place a little bit.  Anyways, the food is VERY good. The chicken shawarma is probably some of the best I have ever had. Hummus, yellow rice, and couscous also go very well with the food. There is the garlic-butter sauce that comes with the shawarma and kabobs, and that REALLY makes the food that much better. Gyro plate is also very commendable, but its hard to get this wrong since the gyro comes on a huge slab and rotates on a rotisserie. Yet, a lot of places do get the gyro plate wrong. I think this place does a good job of heating up the gyro meat on the rotisserie and then the grill.  Baklava also deserves a mention. Its damn good. You can get some exotic mediterranean stuff like olives and feta cheese by the pound, i love that stuff.  The pricing of this place along with the good quality food makes this place a hidden gem. Its like $8 for almost any plate you'd want. Its plenty of food per plate, and for under $20 for 2 people, its worth a visit. Its very easy to compare this stuff to haji baba, its a tough pick. However, I think the hummus here tastes much better, it doesn't taste like its straight out of a can. The plates here I think are a better deal. If you just want a gyro sandwich, then go to haji baba."}
{"text":"Princess Mediterranean Market offers food fit for a princess (Or a group of 6 hungry food adventurers)! I had a lovely evening with some super cool buddies including the awesome Hieyam A. and Grace O. The setup is similar to Haji Baba in that half the business is a market while the other half has a sit down restaurant.  We started with the kibbe as an appetizer. It was a little different than other versions of kibbe I've had in the past but still quite good. Instead of a cube or rectangle of bulgur wheat and beef mixed together, this was more like a samosa with bulgur wheat outer crust with beef inside. It was fried to a light crisp and I enjoyed the flavors and the different textures. I had the veggie combo as an entree which included tabbouli, hummus, baba ganoush, falafel, and grape leaves, served with pita bread. My favorites in the combo were the falafel and the hummus. The hummus was so smooth and creamy with a perfect melding of flavors. The falafel was excellent as well, lightly crispy on the outside, tender soft filling, and a wonderfully balanced blend of seasoning and spice. The tabbouli was the only element I wasn't as thrilled about since it had too much lemon juice for my tastes, but I did also enjoy the baba ganoush which had a smooth light texture and smoked flavor. The grape leaves were decent.   We finished our meal with some delectable baklava. I usually find baklava a little too sweet, or too dry but the ones we had were a nice balance of flakiness and sweetness. We shared a little bit of each type they had: the pistachio, cashew, and walnut.   Service was superb and our server was friendly and sweet.  The restaurant closes a little early (8 PM, 7 PM on Sunday) so I do wish they were open a little later but the market is open until 9 PM most days.  The meals we had were very reasonably priced. Mine was $8 and it was a hefty portion that left me pleasantly full afterwards.  Thanks for a great meal. I will definitely be back for more delicious dishes and to check out the market. I especially want to go back to try the Friday afternoon buffet!  4.5/5."}
{"text":"This place is really great. They don't take to long in making orders and their buffet is really tasty. Their customer service is ok. Sometimes it feels like they are just trying to get through the day but other than that there is no problem I would recommend their beef shawarma to anyone!"}
{"text":"I noticed that for most of the reviews this was their first exposure to Mediterranean food.  We love Mediterranean and have enjoyed it all over the world.  Princess is not one of the finer examples.  We ordered the Chicken Swarma Platters.  The hummus and pita were good but the Chicken was dry and flavorless.  The garlic sauce was not creamy and had a bitter aftertaste.  I honestly can't recommend this one, there has to be better Mediterranean in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh hummus and chicken shawarma...habit forming! my once a week stop. Great selection of spices and rice."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago, I had big expectations the first time I went into Princess Market. Chicago is known for its food, and for a good reason. We have it all there, and it's good! Not only did Princess Market meet my expectations, it exceeded them in every way! The food is amazing!! I'm not sure who can say otherwise...perhaps they don't know good Mediterranean food? Because I've had plenty  and this is some of the best I've ever had-if not the best. Everybody who works there is so nice, they work hard, and always make every experience pleasant. The family who owns Princess are the nicest people ever! I can't say enough good things about this place, it's quickly become my daughters' and my favorite spot in the valley :) It's our home away from home now!"}
{"text":"We came here around 7:15p tonih we walked in and read the sign that said to seat yourself and we did. The man behind the to go order counter area clearly saw us walk in... we waited,  and waited. For about ten minutes we waited for something... anything,  we got nothing... completely ignored. We left, I wonder if the people who went in as we were leaving got the same treatment?"}
{"text":"Great food , great taste especially appetizers are really delicious . They might have the best tabbouleh in town ."}
{"text":"Food is tasty! It's not the best shank I had but successful! Having side dish options is awesome. Ambiance is not up to the mark because it's half restaurant and half market. Rest room is really clean ( I was not expecting this ) We purchased some food from the market section and found some internationally well known brands. Paying $ 8-11 for person is affordable for a meal."}
{"text":"Princess is my Go To for Kebab plates, hummus and sandwiches.  Be sure to check out their tabouli, baba ghanouj as well as the steak and chicken kebab.   There is also a super selection of groceries, tea, gifts and various dry goods availale for sale in their in-store market.  Love coming here. Nour, Dina and staff always make me feel at home. Great Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. Very fresh and very refreshing to eat. If you like baklava there's is outstanding and it's only a dollar. Definitely put this restaurant on your must try list for Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Tried the Chicken Shawarma combo price was nice and food was amazing! Hummus is so good. The lady who also took my order was friendly. Will definitely return. They also have Mediterranean groceries and candy it was a nice place to tryout new things."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's so fresh and good and the people there are always friendly. I started coming here as a student at ASU, and have never stopped coming over the years. I love Mediterranean food, and Princess always satisfies my craving for this kind of cuisine.  Tons of healthy selections, but the baklava is divine if you're in the mood to treat yourself.   I'm a very discerning and critical diner, and I highly suggest Princess Market!"}
{"text":"This is a good restaurant.  The food is very good and prices reasonable.  I especially liked the \"fool adamos\" (sp?) appetizer.     Also their olives are good, and much less expensive than whole foods."}
{"text":"I came here with a reservation for a group of 12, and the restaurant did a great job arranging everything before we all got there. Given the chaos of taking orders for 12 people, each with an individual check, our waitress gets an A+ for being able to handle everything so well.    I ordered the gyro, which was so yummy and the perfect amount of food. The platters that everyone else ordered looked so good, and the portions were definitely on the larger side. We also ordered sides of hummus with pita bread, and the hummus was so creamy and definitely something you have to order when coming here. The only con was waiting for the food...it took almost 40 minutes for the food to come out. I thought the wait was pretty long but I also understand that they wanted to bring out all our food around the same time.   The little market next to the restaurant carries a lot of speciality items and could definitely be a fun place to peruse while waiting for your food. The pricing of our food was amazing...cannot be beat! For the price and the portions, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I like the idea of all-you-can-eat hummus so much, that Princess earned almost all its stars for that. The lunch buffet consists of this, about Pita Jungle quality-hummus, which most seem to dig unquestioningly, plus a bunch of meat, a delicious chopped salad and rice and soup. I was a vegan at the time I visited, and had no problem stuffing my face with loads of hummus and rice on naan, with a bit of Sriracha hot sauce and loads of the pre-dressed salad. I think the meat is usually lamb (perhaps chicken, as well). Both times I've gone, my companions have been disappointed in this meat. One said it was too dry, the other that it lacked the proper seasoning (my dad's big on seasonings). I'd believe it, but I'd still go back."}
{"text":"The food here was amazingly good,  and prices were very fair for the portion of food offered. The gyro sandwich was very large and flavorful.  The meat was extremely tender and well spiced.  This was probably the best gyro I'v eaten in a long time. Also ordered the combo kabob platter.  The grilled meat tasted very authentic and the hummus was very good as well."}
{"text":"So happy i found this place. A few tables set up in a corner of a grocery store that had almost every seat taken. Everone was speaking arabic, so i knew i was in the right place. Great food, authentic, and cheap. No hippy gyro shop here. Will be back soon"}
{"text":"Don't come here with me if you're embarrassed by people stuffing their faces. Fair warning!  I don't know how fast I scarfed down my grilled chicken, hummus, baba ganouj and tabbouleh, but I may have set some type of record. The chicken was so tender and juicy! And I'm kind of like the Goldilocks of hummus, (This hummus is too gritty! This hummus is too lemony!) but theirs was perfectly balanced.  I loooove baklava, but theirs is lacking, so I knocked off a point for that, and because their beverage game is weak, but as long as I can get my food fix, I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Princess Mediterranean is both a middle eastern grocery and a restaurant.  This review is for the restaurant, but the grocery is not bad either.  The menu at Princess is just about what you would expect for the genre - kabobs, shwarma, falafel, served in plates with rice, houmous, and salad, or in wraps.  They also have the usual appetizers.  But the food is well above average - mainly.  The chicken shwarma is tasty and free of odd pieces of skin or cartilage; the rice is also tasty and fluffy.  But the houmous was bland and totally lacked lemon.  The Arabian (chopped) salad made up for that, however, being so overwhelmingly lemony that it was hard to eat.  But if you mixed the two, it was perfect.  My wife liked her falafel wrap, and I thought the Kibbee appetizer was far better than what I have come to expect.  The Princess is clean, bright, and in good repair (well -- not quite perfect; our booth had torn vinyl).  The service is fine, and the prices are really quite low.  Most plates are around $10, and the wraps around $5.  This could well be a regular for me if only it were closer to my normal haunts."}
{"text":"My friend and I went there for lunch today. Service was prompt and we had a seat outdoors. The server was helpful in describing the details of the food to two middle eastern food newbies. Princess Platter had a little of everything. The food was delicious! My favorite was the chicken kabobs with the garlic sauce. The hummus was excellent. I'm looking forward to their Friday lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"I love this place- never judge a book by its cover.  Unique little place- grocery store/restaurant.  I ordered the chicken Schwarma (choose 3 sides) hummus,  table,  and garden salad- all really good.  Husband ordered chicken kabob with baba, hummus and arabic salad- again awesome!  Super laid back,  very friendly service. My new go to place.  Also found pickled veggies at the market,  so yummy!"}
{"text":"Have ventured out and tried many hole in the wall Mediterranean delis in Tempe and Chandler area. So far none compare to Princess for falafel, arabic salad, hummus, babaganoush, kibbeh and pistachio baklava.   Falafel in other places are pretty good but Princess are lighter, come with tahini and always crispy.  The baba and hummus are well blended and whipped light in texture which is my preference."}
{"text":"Like many people who work or live in the western part of Mesa near the 101 I have driven by this place 2-4 times a day for the past 13 years.  I don't want to add up how many times that is but 2000 might be reasonable. I have to admit that the location is a bit weird, its a strange little mall tucked away from the street.  The sign has letters I don't understand.    I went there because one of my techs was called to work on one of their refrigerated cases and told me how nice it was.   I went in there and did not tell them anything about my guys working there.  They were so incredibly nice and helpful I could not believe it.  When I told them that is was my first time there they patiently explained everything on the menu to me and even brought me samples of some items I had not had before.    The shwarma is my favorite for the meats (both chicken and beef) but everything I have tried is fresh and flavorful.  Their kabobs use good quality meat that isn't too chewy.  I am a total hummus snob and make my own frequently.  Theirs is made fresh every day and tastes as good as my home made if not better.  In fact my wife bought some at Costco today and it was so bad in comparison that it made me remember I had to give these people a good review.   You can buy the same ingredients in the attached store and if you ask they will tell you which ones are best.   The have great pita bread in the freezer you can warm up and is better than any other pita bread around here.  Their prices in both the restaurant and deli are very reasonable for the quality of the food.  Another reviewer mentioned wiping the tables with the same rag as they wiped the tables.  I have seen multiple restaurants do this and as long as the rag has proper disinfectant I do not see anything wrong with it. In fact -- think about it -- you almost always put your hands down on a booth when  you slide in, then you eat with them!  I am GLAD they wipe down the booths with disinfectant.    I like this place because it is clean, you can see back into the kitchen and see how they keep it.  I don't think giving such a low rating for what seems to be a standard practice is very fair.   Yes, the different tiles in the dining room a a bit weird, but it is only like 1/4\" difference.  The location is a little different as is the layout.  In the first of this review I mentioned I had driven buy it literally thousands of times over the last 13 years. It seemed a little odd and I missed out all that time by not exploring it.  If you don't like exploring a little different cultures go to McDonald's.  These are hard working people who make the best food they know how, make it fresh and are incredibly nice.  They have some very beautiful women working there who are also very nice and helpful.  The whole place is maybe a little different than we are used to in Mesa but if you want interesting and flavorful experience stop there and give them a try."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing here!! Beef Shwarma and chicken Shwarma are two of the best items on the menu. Their Turkish coffee is also delicious!"}
{"text":"The best Lebanese/Arabic food I've had in the metro Phoenix area yet!"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst food experiences I have ever had! EVER! After we ordered, it took us an hour to get our food. Everyone who came after us, got their food first. We finally got our food and our Chicken Kebab was burned to a crisp. It could have been mistaken for coal. Then, to apologize, they gave us free baklava. Which was mushy and flavorless. I will NEVER return. Not worth my time or money."}
{"text":"I'm on the trail to find the best Baba ganoush! Tasted good.  7 out of 10 stars.   The lentil soup was good. The baklava was good but I like mine sweeter. (No biggie just a personal preference) Inconsistent between each piece if that matters to you. One was sweeter than the other one, and one was more \"buttery\" tasting than the other.  The lemon served with the lentil soup was fresh like they had just picked it which I really appreciate. (Most places don't realize that sometimes it's the littlest of things which people notice)  Very friendly staff. Prompt and courteous service.  Definitely would eat there again."}
{"text":"Having had skipped lunch I ordered the Princess Combo ($20, for two but who's counting?) for take out. When I got home, all I could say was \"Wow, amazing hummus... Wow, this rice... Mmm, the lamb/chicken kabobs... The shwarma was really tasty and the pita bread emitted a plume of fresh baked-smell when I opened the package. I still have the ground beef patty to eat later, and overall highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"First time there my girlfriend and I were looking for a quick bite to eat, didn't want to be too pricey either but still get filled up. Got there and sat down anywhere, waiter came over to us and gave us menus quick, took or drink order and returned within 5 minutes. I order the chicken shawarma pita combo with fries and a drink, my girlfriend got the salmon plate. It took a little longer than I expected to get our food. Once the food came out, it was very good. Fries had a great seasoning on them and crispy, personally how I like them. The pita was very good with added taziki sauce. The salmon was a large plate with salad, rice, and another small bowl of something didn't know what it was but it was good. Total was only $22 and we were both full and happy. On our way out we noticed that the waiter was also behind the kitchen doing multiple things. Overall very good and after the first thought of, what is this going to be like, we will be going back."}
{"text":"Seriously the best food in town. The chicken shwarma is amazing and the portion is huge. They also have the best hummus I've ever had. The owner and wait staff are helpful and the service is quick. Princess is a must try!"}
{"text":"These guys are awesome.  Super cool little ethnic grocery store inside as well as a great restaurant.  We've enjoyed several items on the menu and visited many times.  Service and food has always been great!"}
{"text":"This place is like a hidden gem. Princess is the best Arabic food I've had in Arizona by a long shot. The meat is prepared perfectly every time, flavor and juicy. The falafel is also very good.   The only thing that I would change is the bread, it doesn't seem like they make their bread, and if they did it would make this much better. I am not taking off a star because I don't believe there's somewhere nearby that compares."}
{"text":"This little market has a nice selection of Mid East grocery, but.... it's the little restaurant that stand out. Incredibly delicious food, plenty of it! Well planned out combo plates and great service! Can't say enough good about this place. Everything's delicious... Kafta, Falafel, Hummus, salads... you can't go wrong! Great service as well."}
{"text":"I use to love this place but I noticed the prices started to go up but i still went because is was close to home and pretty decent for a Vegan meal. However yesterday I ordered lentil soup that had chicken it. I called and they offered me a free soup. No big deal right? I wasn't too upset I know it happenss. When I went to pick it up they acted like I was lying and gave me watered down soup. Really? I spend 15-20$ in there every other week why would I need to lie about a 4$ cup of soup. Never again will I go back there. I found a better place right up the street with better prices and better food so I should thank them! Its called Haji baba!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Mediterranean place I have tried out my lunch at Valley- Very caring staff as well . I would love to visit it again. Ketan"}
{"text":"I came here first as a business venture to repair a computer, and was invited back to try the food by the owner's brother. I am SO glad I came back. The Gyro sandwich was the best one I've ever had; it was delicious, and not greasy, nor was it dry. It was just perfect. And the hummus, which is home made, was fantastic. Beats the pants off what I got for twice the cost at Pita Jungle. The baklava? The walnut was good, but the pistachio was divine!   The prices here are amazing, and the service is excellent. Sadi, the gentleman that invited me back, is a great representation of what excellent customer service is about. He's made me feel like more than just a customer; he made me feel like family here. The store is undergoing some changes (it's been here for over 10 years!) but Sadi is marketing the business out and the food will speak for itself.  They have a Gyro Combo: Gyro, fries, and a fountain drink for $4.95. Come give it a try, get some shisha for your hookah (they're also a middle eastern grocery store), and bring a friend! It's worth it!"}
{"text":"We've come to princess for yrs, know the family well & have always been teated & served well here. However not today. The restaurant was not very busy but we waited a very long time to be served, had to ask for menus & ordered items that were  not served. Not sure we will be back anytime soon. Very disappointing. If we're going to pay over $10 per plate for our meal the service should reflect that. Its the service that brings you back. I can get great Mediterranean food anywhere."}
{"text":"Best food ever and reasonably priced! Can't go wrong with princess plate and baklava. Also spinach pies are delicious."}
{"text":"This place is off the book delicious.  I'm not a big fan of buffets, but from 12 -  4 on Fridays, its on.  Amazing chicken curry, kofta and tabouli, rice and assorted deliciousness."}
{"text":"Best falafel pita I ever ate! all vegan too! it was very fast and very good price 4.86$ you can beat that it going to be my number one for falafel from now!"}
{"text":"Incredibly tasty and worth every star!!! Had a delicious meal two nights in a row from here. The baklava was to die for-- don't miss it."}
{"text":"Best midetterianian food Great kabab Great hommus Great service Cons: it took long time"}
{"text":"I'm a skeptic when it comes to middle eastern food, usually thinking that most restaurants cook similarly and everyone's shawarma/kabobs/hummus/etc taste the same.  WRONG! All I can say is...wow. The flavor of the beef and chicken shawarma was magical. I wasn't that hungry and thought I'd only take a couple of bites of my combo plate and save the rest for later; instead, I ate most of it and saved just a couple of bites for later.  The baba ganoush was the best baba ganoush I've ever had. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for chicken shawarma and gyros.  You can get a sandwich shawarma for only $4.50 and you can make it into a combo.  You can also get a plate as well for $9.99  The chicken and gyro always has so much flavor along with the delicious garlic sauce!   The staff is always nice and attentive.  The baklava is mouth watering delicious here! They make them fresh. The pistachio is my favorite and the cashew.  You can get a whole to go box for $10 which is about 12 pieces."}
{"text":"Fantastic!   It's a grocery store and has a diner in area as well.  We had the Princess Platter and its $22. It's a bit pricey but that fed both of us and had us pretty content. Not an insane amount of food for $22 but enough and will be a solid meal.  We also had some white cream cheese dip appetizer that we didn't love. It needs something else like a ground hot beef or gyro meat on top. It's a bit tart.  They gave us a little $1 Baklava to try for free. It's about 2 bites but also delicious.  So the big question everyone would have that is into middle eastern food is how does it stack up to Haji Baba. Well, it's better in all ways except for the Shawarma and the Garlic Mayo. I'm still not sure why no one else makes their shwarma and garlic mayo like Haji!!! Drives me nuts.  The beef at this place and Gyro is def better than Haji. The beef Shawrma was fantastic. Haji has horrible beef in pretty much most forms it comes.  Great spot!"}
{"text":"One pit stop spot! They have all you need from  hookah supplies to groceries, and not to forget their great authentic Mediterranean food, I recommend their shawerma combo! Their customers service is also on point and the staff is really friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered from here off of UberEats and was very impressed! A gentleman at my job always mentions Princess and how delicious it is so I decided to give it a try! I got the falafel sandwich and fries, which were moderately priced and really tasty! It came with a lot of food and didn't leave me disgusted and full. I will definitely be eating here again!"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service. All the food served was delicious but my favorite was the yogurt cucumber salad"}
{"text":"The food is so amazinggg! Love coming here. Got the combo plate today, meat was perfectly done & was filling."}
{"text":"I would say one of my top three Mediterranean spots in the valley. I have known the family for YEARS and they never fail to have excellent customer service and take out. My family and will order dinner on sunday nights when we don't feel like cooking and it is pretty affordable for the quality and quantity. It was really convenient when I forgot about a potluck and was able to order and get my food for 15 in 20 mins. The food is always fresh and well done. not a rice person, but I will always eat the rice here... definitely amazing. Slowly trying to convince my brother to have them cater his wedding just because I want another excuse to eat their kafte and hummus! If you are a vegitarian, their Felafel is amzing!"}
{"text":"I haven't had Mediterranean food that good in a long time. I will definitely be back. Great food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I love Middle Eastern food, and this place did not disappoint!  Great food, amazing prices, and wonderful selection. The market area is a little bit lacking in terms of ambiance (looks like it could use a serious remodel), but the restaurant area is just fine.  Awesome place to get some authentic and delicious eats!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place!  Best grape leaves I have ever had.  The staff is fun and friendly.  We have started having our meetings here. I would give more stars if I could."}
{"text":"Yum! This place is awesome - affordable and tasty. I ordered the chicken shawarma plate w/ rice, tabouleh, hummus and pita. Tons of food and beyond delicious. And for less than $10! Got some pistachio baklava to go, tried some in the car on the way home, and seriously think it's some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Updating with another five! Why might you ask? I love this place that much, of course! We always get fantastic service, the food is AMAZING, and it's a nice cozy little place. Plus, grocery shopping afterwards! I honestly recommend this place to anyone who wants great Mediterranean food. For those of the vegetarian persuasion such as I, they are great at separation. I have not once had an issue of cross contamination and have not once gotten sick here. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Love this place. Really amazing food. I strongly encourage you to try the princess combo. My only wish is that they'd stay open later! There were dozens of times this year when we wanted to go, but they were already closed for the day!"}
{"text":"What can I say...Love this place. The food is definitely the best mediterranean I've had in the valley. Chicken Shawarma and lamb shank are where it's at. The hummus is thick and delicious too. Go in not expecting much but awesome food at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"So my classmates family owns this place but by no means is this review biased...the food really is good! Just look at all the reviews!  Stopped by here recently on my way to Ikea. My favorite items are the chicken shwarma, hummus, baba ganoush, gyros, and falafel and sambusas. I need to try their lamb stew next time, it looks amazing. Definitely check out the market itself, I always pick up some spices, tea, and pita, but they also have some cooking utensils and frozen foods. The only thing I wish they had was halal meat but no butcher shop here :/ The food is worth the trip from Glendale!"}
{"text":"I went to the Princess Mediterranean Market & Deli tonight with my girlfriend on a whim and it turned out to be my new favorite restaurant in this area.  The food is so amazing it made me sad I'm not Palestinian so I could eat that food on the regular :) - The owner and our waitress were super friendly.  I've had kabobs and kafta before, but this was hands down the best I've ever had!  I will be eating here again and I suggest you do the same!  I'm not a big fan of hummus and I even enjoyed that!"}
{"text":"I ordered steak kabob platter to go.  Substituted baba ganoush for the rice, everything was superb.  There is some outdoor seating so we took advantage of that.   Baba ganoush was perfect, slightly smokey from roasting the eggplants before blending.  Other establishments may.skip this.step, but.it does make a difference.  Enjoyed listening to Amir Diab  & soaking in the sun.  Steak kabobs were tender and juicy."}
{"text":"The food was really good also the service. The kibbis out of this world and the special hummus with beef amazing! Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"LOOOOOOOOOOOOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE this place!   I have enjoyed every single thing I have eaten here and it is totally worth the drive for me from Central Phoenix.  My absolute favorite thing to order is the chicken shawarma plate with the baba ganoush, tabouleh and the grape leaves appetizer. The chicken is amazingly moist and tender and comes with a side of the blow-your-face-off amazing garlic sauce. The b.g. is defintely some of the best I have had in the valley. The grape leaves are perfectly flavored and lemony fresh.   Oh man, now I think I talked myself into heading over there for dinner right about now...."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for Friday lunch buffet. Seriously, a lot of buffet lunches are nothing to write home about, but this food is excellent. And be sure to ask for the Lamb Shank, which is included with the buffet but will be brought to your table. Falling off the bone - delicious!"}
{"text":"Wow, my condolences to the people living in the Phoenix area for having such limited access to great Middle Eastern restaurants.  I live in Dallas, Texas, where there's an abundance and highly competitive market for Middle Eastern food, and my in-laws are from Chicago where Middle Eastern, particularly Palestinian, cuisine is on par with the quality from overseas.  Also, my family owns a well known restaurant in Dallas so I have been trained and learned the appropriate way to treat customers.  Therefore, please keep in mind while reading this review the type of customer service and food quality that I am used to.     We made a reservation blindly; we had no idea what this restaurant looked like (i.e. how small, dark, and old it looked) or even where it was located.  Because it's Ramadan, we made the reservation for their iftar buffet, which promptly starts at 7:30 p.m.  We get there about 15 minutes late (which in Dallas and anywhere else, I believe, is not an issue) and notify a young man, I'm assuming an assistant manager/manager due to his demeanor, that we had a reservation.  We were hoping that he would warmly greet us and then guide us to our reserved table.  Instead, we were met with callousness when he proceeded to curtly tell us that because we are late, our table was given away (he didn't even visually scan the seating area to confirm this), we should have been there at exactly 7:30, we have no place to sit, and we were warned about this when making the reservation, which we weren't.  He was pretty much telling us that we were shit out of luck and bye!  My family and I stood there completely shocked by his answer and demeanor; it was unapologetic, confrontational, and unsympathetic.  He seemed stressed out.  Maybe their restaurant is not used to having a full house, which in this case is about only 30 people... Luckily, an assertive young lady came to our rescue by bypassing this young man and said, \"Hey, table 1 is empty (most likely our reserved table), let them sit there!\" The young man looked annoyed that his authority was undermined, rolled his eyes, and, without moving from his place, pointed us to table one.  I don't know what his role at this restaurant is, but he utterly failed in the customer relations department.  Almost everyone who works here is very young and there didn't seem to be an experienced restauranteur around to guide them.  Customer service 1 out 5!  Food was meh.  Their selection was incredibly limited.  I believe they had about 12 items (which includes fruit and salad) in their buffet?  All of the Middle Eastern restaurants in Dallas (Afrah, Sababa, Jasmine, Sultan, and Sanabel's) offers at least 30 items.  But hey, that's the largest buffet stand they have so they do what they can.  The food was not memorable.  As I write this review, I can't even remember what I had from there. I only remember the really bad taste in my mouth from dealing with that young man.   Basically, I understand why locals rate this place 4 stars or higher; they don't have access to better Middle Eastern food!  Because Dallas is a highly competitive food market, the managers/owners will treat everyone with respect and tries their hardest to win over customers through their service and quality of food.  For example, during Ramadan, Afrah's owner, who was featured on Food Network's Guy Fieri's show, is there every night greeting customers and making sure that everyone is treated well.  His restaurant can occupy 250, I believe.  You can imagine how hectic the restaurant gets during Ramadan, but one day my husband and I show up without a reservation and the place is completely packed, but he tells us, \"Don't worry, I'll look for a table for you and make it happen!\"  He knows that we are tired and hungry from fasting, and behold, he arranges an empty table for us among a sea of people.  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the standard for good customer service and an example of an owner who is dedicated to building a loyal customer base.    So to the people of Arizona, if you ever come to Dallas, Texas, try out one or as many of the Middle Eastern restaurants I mentioned and you will be in awe of their food and at the same time angered by the realization of the subpar service and food you all endure."}
{"text":"This place has the best wraps! They're falafel is actually not too dry and their Hummus is also pretty good. Overall I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I used to be regular at this restaurant.  Over the course of time I have unfortunately seen the quality of this place slip.  I used to really enjoy this place.  The Princess Combo was good.    I went to Princess last night with my wife.  We ordered the Princess Combo.  The following are some of the observations noted:  1) The cleanliness of the place has slipped.  Please clean your booths and tables (the tables and the floors).  It was nearly impossible to find a clean table.  Cleanliness is something that my wife and I do not compromise on.  We have been to the developing world, and even with that, we still find restaurants in the developing world much cleaner.    2) Some of the dishes need to be cleaned better.  I had a water glass that was stained, and asked for a new glass.  Please pay attention to this.    3) My wife found the beef or lamb kabab, in the Princess Combo (do not know which one it was) as being very chewy (inedible).  We enjoy kababs but it was just too chewy.  We could not determine if it was beef or lamb.  It was just too chewy.  Either it was overcooked, or undercooked (I am guessing overcooked...it was not red or raw).  My wife and I have experienced Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food and we love it.  We have been to that part of the world, and have many friends who are from that part of the world.    Also, a lot of my colleagues where I work know that I tend to find restaurants that are \"diamonds in the rough\".  I used to think that Princess was one of them.  I am questioning this now.    Many of my colleagues are former military, and politics aside, they have been deployed in the Middle East, and they remember that corner cafe or related in Saudi, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Turkey, etc.  They acquired that taste while serving there.  They often ask me about places I recommend for Middle Eastern food.  I used to recommend this place.  I am questioning whether to recommend this place now.    Please take a long and hard look at your place:  1) Clean it up 2) Figure out what has changed (for the worse), and fix it as far as food  I trust that you have a good people who mean well.  Perhaps a little training may be all that is needed.    You have a good \"product\" or \"service\", you just need to burnish your image a little bit in order to \"return\" to what I would call a 5 star rating.    I recommend you do it soon so that the reputation of the place is not tarnished.  I want this place to do well, but you need to re-double your efforts and go back to the basics."}
{"text":"I ended up here after checking my Yelp app during a doctor's appointment in the area. I am SO GLAD I found it! I love ethnic grocery stores. I can get sucked in and explore for hours. They had a lot of Middle Eastern foods, with American items in the mix, too.  The staff is great! I was greeted as soon as I walked in.  I got the beef gyro plate, which came with your choice of 3 sides. I got the hummus, baba ghanoush, and tabbouleh. They also offer fries, but why the heck would I get fries at a Mediterranean deli? Crazy talk! The meat was sliced thinly, super tender, and had the right amount of grease. Hey, if you're gonna eat meat, you gotta have some grease, right? RIGHT? The sides were great, too. They were drizzled with olive oil, which always tells me I'm at a place that knows how to make the food they are advertising. I have the leftovers in the fridge, and can't wait to eat it! I will definitely be back. Again. And again. And again."}
{"text":"Found this place when looking for a new Mediterranean restaurant to try in town. Tried the Chicken Shawarma and the Beef Kafta Plates, which came with rice, pita and hummus, and your choice of salad. Both entrees were really good, the beef kafta had a savory seasoning that is unique to this Mediterranean restaurant. The salads were great, the tabouleh had a refreshing mint taste to it, and held a sour aftertaste. Overall, the place is exactly what I wanted from a Mediterranean and Arabic restaurant."}
{"text":"I have lived one block from this place for 7 years and never knew it was there so what i'm saying is you could easily miss it driving by. If you do drive by it i am pleased to say this place is definately worth the U-Turn. It's also a mediteranean market so if you like trying drinks, snacks, whatever you have never had before you can also do that. We had lunch there and the food was awesome. We will be going there every week now!"}
{"text":"I read one of the reviews below, and I would have to agree with the getting sick to the stomach part. It was not fun, thus, the 3 stars. But then again maybe it has something to do with trying out a different cuisine? Me and my buddy at work would come here at least once a week for lunch for the past couple of months now and I got sick to my stomach maybe twice or three times....But because the food is good, I blame that to being adventurous on foods....  Anyway, I had chicken shawarma sandwich it was only $3.99 and I would say a really great value. To me it's better than the beef shawarma. It always tastes goooood. I often have it with garlic paste. Leaves your mouth pungent tasting and dry but  just chew gum when you go back to work or eat fruits."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty amazing. The service, not so much, is very slow. I might not go here for lunch anymore unless it was take out. But the food alone keeps me a fan! Then you can stock up on whatever Mediterranean items you need in the attached market!"}
{"text":"We ordered food from here using a third party food delivery service.  I got the schwarma plate with both beef and chicken, the gyro plate, and the Greek salad.  Each of the plates came with a tiny side \"salad\" (really just lettuce) and a small side of hummus.  Their hummus was really good!  The pita it came with wasn't my favorite because I like the fluffier pita bread.  The meat in each of the plates was good, flavorful and tender.  The Greek salad was also good, but HUGE.  And unfortunately they had pre-mixed the dressing in and since I could not finish the salad all in one meal it turned out to be too soggy and I had to throw the rest away.  Next time I'll be sure to request dressing on the side... although usually whenever you order delivery the dressing is packaged on the side!  Overall, we would order from here again - especially the hummus."}
{"text":"Awesome first time! Food was really fresh and nice :) I had an awesome time eating there, it was super nice and the ambiance was refreshing"}
{"text":"I heard about Princess and their good reviews for a couple of years.  Finally tried it with a friend Aug 1, 2017.  I love lamb and ordered the lamb shank for $12.  It comes dry (they said they steam it) with no sauce.  I wanted a bowl of juice or gravy, for which they did not tell me, costs 50 cents extra.  I later saw on my bill, after I got home and looked at my bill to reference it for this review.  My friend said her Greek salad did not have enough dressing and wanted more salad dressing.   When I got  home, I found another extra charge for the small container of dressing on my bill, too, another 50 cents.  I wish they would tell me first, that our request costs 50 cents each, so we could make a choice.  I did not  think to look at the details of the bill before I paid it.  So I took off one star for not being informed about the extra charges.  My server Emily did tell me there is extra charge for MORE lamb juices when I was leaving and asked if I could have more juice to take home to eat with my leftovers, but I thought the charge was for a second request for more juice,   I turned the gravy that costs, down.  At that time, I didn't know I was charged for even my first request for salad dressing and lamb gravy.  She did not tell us of extra charge for the small container of extra salad dressing when we asked for it and when she brought it to our table.  I eat out several times a week, and do not recall ever being charged in my long life (I am a senior) for more salad dressing when you feel there is not enough on your salad in the first place.  They just bring you more.  My friend did love her Greek salad though, said it did not wilt when she had the leftovers the next day, but that is because she did not add the extra dressing when she boxed it to go at the restaurant.    I liked my lamb shank but it was not any different from other restaurants lamb shank i had at Habbouz Tunisian, Persian Room, Haji Baba, Mijana and other Mediterranean places.  Without the gravy side, it would have been quite boring and dry.  I take the meat off the bone and mash into the juices, and that is what made it delicious. So I would pay 50 cents in the future for the juices on the side (no juice or sauce is included with your entree, just a dry lamb shank), but I didn't appreciate not being told that a first request incurs a charge, which I think was the fault of the man at the counter where I placed my order.    We also tried both the beef and chicken shawarma, but as expected, the chicken was very hard and dry and even the beef was very dry.  That is why I never order chicken when I go out to eat, most places cook it like formed sawdust.  Only Khyber Halal did a marvelous job of grilling chicken cubes, so tender and moist and charbroiled flavor.  So the second star deduction is for the hard and dry chicken and beef shawarmas.    The hummus and baba ganoush was really good 8 of 10 stars, but for lamb shank, I think the best lamb shank is the box of 2 I buy from Costco, because it COMES already soaked in DELICIOUS gravy.      I give our server, blond lady named Emily 4 stars, because she came 2 times to check if we needed anything more, but I woulda given her 5 stars if she disclosed that the extra salad dressing would be another 50 cents added to our bill, which again I only discovered when I am looking at my check from 4 days ago, to write this review.  Interior atmosphere was too dark for my liking, even by the window, and my booth seat had a long rip in it, not taped, but I sat anyhow, in more to avoid the rip.    I might come back here to try the baklava and gyros, since several of my Yelp Eliter Friends raved about those items.  My friend wants to order the lamb shank."}
{"text":"We had the princess combo and it was awesome. The beef, lamb and chicken was very good. The combo is for two people and its served with Pita bread, Rice and Salad. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"First, we were served by the most enthusiastic, nicest, friendliest waitress Lauren. She could not rave enough about the food and she was right. We loved the lentil soup, the labne, the falafel sandwich (spectacular), the lamb shank entree (order 2 of them!) and even the rice is worth coming back for. Our only complaint is that we wish we lived closer but I wouldn't rule out us driving 2 hours for this authentic middle eastern cuisine."}
{"text":"We were visiting the Phoenix area to celebrate my husband's birthday.  He wanted to have a Mediterranean meal. We got the plate for two.  The food was delicious and service was great."}
{"text":"The food is so good here! And one time I went shopping to make my own stuff at home I had no idea what I was looking for or where and when I got home what id be doing the staff there were so helpful and informative the whole experience was grand!"}
{"text":"My first time trying Mediterranean and I loved it! Hyatt was one of the best servers I've ever had and she was SUPER helpful with recommending what to get. If you have the chance, I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food is always bomb here so the wait is well worth it. It's such a hidden gem.   It's usually packed and there is only one or two people working the tables so expect delays. My favorite items are the stuffed grape leaves and the hummus."}
{"text":"I literally eat here every day because I work across the street. My company is moving office buildings, and I'm mostly sad to be moving away from Princess. I call everyday and order the same damn thing, it's almost embarrassing.  Everyone there is really cool, friendly, and pleasant every day.  The falafel sandwich is THE best falafel I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great food!  They have a wonderful option of dishes to choose from.  Family owned local business with great service and excellent desserts!"}
{"text":"Someone thought it would be funny to draw an inverted pentagram on my ticket just because it number..   Didn't appreciate this and when I called I offered to email a picture to the manager and he denies that his employees had any part in this.  Won't ever be coming back to this place given the act and the resolution.  Food was okay, shawarma wasn't shaved it seemed like carne asada."}
{"text":"What a hidden little surprise this is! I can't believe it's been here for 9 years! Thank you yelp for discoveries like this!   This is a very nice Mediterranean little market, they even sell huge bottles of avocado oil for $10! The cheapest I could ever find before this has been $20, so I'm pretty excited about that!   The deli is great!! The Gyro meat is thicker cut and not dry at all (and it didn't give me heartburn, woo hoo!) I brought a friend and she just loved her gyro wrap. The hummus is fresh, homemade tasting, served with a nice drizzle of olive oil on top.... Mmmm super good...   Service is super friendly and helpful. I'm so glad to have found this little gem! I haven't tried the buffet yet, but I'm definitely looking forward to trying it out in the future."}
