{"text":"Very authentic! I was kind of scared to go in because it looks out of place where it is but i was very impressed with the food.  The pupusas are huge for only 1.75"}
{"text":"The food was good but he staff is incredibly rude. Just left and I didn't even finish my food. I was there with my autistic nephew and the waiter and waitress were so inconsiderate. Like they have never seen an child like him. That just made me so angry."}
{"text":"Was craving pupusas for a while now!! And finally decided to go and definitely one of my favorite place. 
Recently moved here and tried different pupusas places haven't found one as tasty. Definitely going back and I recommend it. I've came here twice already and haven't been disappointed, I always get them to go and the wait isn't bad they are busy so I don't mind waiting a little because they are very tasty. The price was very reasonable to $2 per pupusas!!!!"}
{"text":"Best pupusas in Las Vegas!!!! You notice the quality and taste. Been to other restaurants and nothing compared to this place or any of their locations. Family owned and great people!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service try the main dish las pupusas delivers with homemade food and touch of culture. Size enough for a medium size group. The service friendly with a smile."}
{"text":"The biggest pupusas I've ever seen! Great flavors and loads of cheese. Plenty of cabbage, just wish they had a salsa besides the traditional vinegar sauce. The menu is huge. Only other thing I tried were the plantain empenadas which were sweet and delicious.  Awesome location as well."}
{"text":"I just loved the Pupusas... the combination in the best, order it well done, and ignore the cole slaw which is bland and boring (add some sugar and vinegar and it will be fine)."}
{"text":"Didn't get to try because the girl was so rude. She was counting money, didn't acknowledge us and then when we said something she gave us a really mean look and said to hold on. When she was finally done, she says \"yes?\" Like we are bothering her. This place will not get my business!"}
{"text":"Was recommended this place by a friend when I asked about good tasting popusas! Walked in and placed an order to go and wait was about 10 minutes which is great timing when your starving. Food was very good & prices are great for food portions."}
{"text":"This place is clearly small, and busy with a steady stream of takeout orders so don't be surprised if there's a little bit of a wait - but it is worth it. The food is excellent, and good value as well. We tried the onion steak, platanos plate, rice and beans, and pupusas with cheese, zucchini and loroco. Loved the curtido that comes with the pupusas. The steak was very tender and came in a good sized portion with rice, beans and salad. The pupusas are perfectly cooked - nice, moist and fluffy, with just enough color on them. The service was friendly, and they checked in with us several times to refill drinks and see how we were doing. It was a great experience overall and we will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Shrimp cocktail was good, but the carne asada tacos were a little bland, but great price per taco. Had the pupusa they were ok, but than again I only have had a pupusa one other time so I don't have much to compare too. I tried the Revueltos and the Loroco.  Cute little place tucked in the corner.  Staff was the waitress,  cashier, and cook :) very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I work close by and pass by everyday, so today was the day to try them out. Very glad I did. Smiling faces, looked like some mothers in the kitchen preparing a meal. Yeah, my kind of place. The pupusas was great and they can even cook a mean burger. Definitely becoming a regular. Want a quick home cooked meal head on in you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best pupusas in town. price is reasonable.  They make the pupusas fresh and you can watch them while they make it.  You can also order other El Salvadoranean foods. Tried their chicken tamales and it was delicious, would like to have more chicken than the masa though.  The place is located near the outlet mall and they have pretty good parking space."}
{"text":"Always wondered what this Pupusas restaurant was. Finally decided to go in side to find out. Not what I had expected the inside to look like, it was not a bad gloomy place. Business professionals were inside eating. So I decided to order some food. I had ordered cheese enchiladas, a burrito, pork tamel, and of course bean and  cheese pupusas. Ok, so this is Salvadoran food and not Mexican. Tamel was delicious (soft and wrapped in a banana leaf). Pupusas are just like gorditas. I loved them. They make them fresh. And the best part, they aren't expensive."}
{"text":"Love this place. 
Grew up in L.A and had home made pupusas @ my BF house. 
It's just as good but it would hit the spot.."}
{"text":"This location is the first & the one I first went to- until moving closer to the Craig rd location ( which is smaller but the food is identical)

This place is big & open with many tables- the server was super nice & I think they have a Busser or whoever he was was very jovial y attentive.

The menu pictures w numbers that make u want everything & the tiny prices are on one page by number behind the pictures..
Any who I like the  papusas revueltas (w everything) or just cheese are really good & filling but the Tamales are another level the masa is amazing & though there is not too much meat or vege inside the flavor is something I regularly crave  - no offense but traditional mexican tamales are dry where salvi ones (wrapped in banana leafs)are mega moist!! Chicken or pork you can't go wrong .. 
I wish there was jaritos tamarindo here bcz they hv fresa & maybe pi√±a but not a big deal.
Don't forget the #14 is amazing & super nachos should not be passes up no matter how full u get.."}
{"text":"The food is okay but the service is TERRIBLE I even had to get up and get my own refill after waiting 20 minutes!!! It wasn't busy we were there when they opened so it was just my party of three and some other person in there so there was no excuses for the AWFUL service. STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"wait time is not as long as the other Las Pupusas chains.  and i love the ceiling fans, feels like i'm in a tropical country.  food is good as usual."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a few Salvadoran restaurants, and this one is great. Walking inside, the atmosphere is friendly and cute, plenty of flat screen tvs playing the soccer game, \"GOAL!\" I only ordered a carne Asada burrito to-go. The burrito was delicious! I only wish I had ordered more food, \"Que Rico!!!\" I grew up eating papusas, next time I'm ordering some, along with some platanos fritos con frijoles y crema. Thank goodness I live close to this lovely gem. I'll be coming back to dine-in next time. The prices are VERY affordable. Salvadorian food is the window to my  heart."}
{"text":"Muy rica la comida pero muy mal servicio las meseras tardan en servir las bebidas y te tratan con una cara de fuchi se les olvida que uno paga lo que consume"}
{"text":"The pupusas were not freshly made, they were microwaved and stale. The flan had a weird consistency . Food was terrible."}
{"text":"I love their pupusas. I haven't tried anything other then that. The place is spacious for a group so I may have to bring people in. The lady behind the counter is nice too."}
{"text":"This is going to be short - I really love the papusas here! I have tried them all and I love them all! Get a couple of papusas, top them with cabbage salad and some spicy sauce and enjoy a quick dinner with Horchata. Sometimes I have three when I am a bit more hungry. 

P.S. I have read some negative reviews regarding service - I do not expect five star service for $2 papusas. The order takes time and I am fine with that."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! This is a regular go to for my husband and I!
Anytime we have family or friends in town we make sure we take them here. They are never disappointed.
 Dine in or out. It's all good. I've never had an order messed up and you always get your moneys worth."}
{"text":"Good papusas! Had fried platanos and empanadas - papusas are a very good size and very tasty!"}
{"text":"Since the last time I've been here they really redecorated. Doesn't look like a hole in the wall anymore and the floors are clean :) 
I always get plantanos and papusas and it's always good. My daughter is allergic to everything and loves that they have yucca fries here.
I see why people complain about how long it takes or servers not speaking good English. It feels like they make everything from scratch when you order it. Also when they served our food they mixed up our papusas. And didn't even announce what's the last plate she put down was so my husband an I had ours switched which is really irritating because I hate beans."}
{"text":"WHATCH OUT! 
The workers that are hear pretended to not understand English and take your money horrible service I hope no one gives them service or there time and money you will be taken advantage for not speaking Spanish and no get the right amount of money back because they steal .
I would just like everyone who gives them business to be aware ."}
{"text":"the food is great i lovee it but the service and the waitress there is one idont know her name but she gives u dirty looks looks miserable like she doesnt want to be there thats the only reason i only go once in a wile i could love the food but if the service is garbage i wont go anymore"}
{"text":"Surprised I had forgotten to write a review before now. Las Pupusas has become a favorite lunch spot. Can't beat $1.75 Pupusas and tacos. I prefer those delicous pancake like treats filled with queso. Made even better with fresh slaw and tomato sauce. Calling in orders often means mystery items, rarely is the order accurate, but nothing has ever been bad. Dining in has avoided any problems."}
{"text":"I had someone give me homemade pupusas before and I liked it. At Las Pupusas, the pupusas were definitely fresh and piping hot, just how I like my food. I mainly tasted the cheese, which they put a ton of inside, and couldn't taste the pork. The service was OK, not overly friendly or rude. I think it's mainly because of the language barrier. Don't know for sure if I'd go back, though."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place. Granted I did not have the actual Pupusas because I was afraid they all came with cheese (I should have asked, I know) 

I had the fajitas with just vegetables  and no meat, they had no problems not doing it, even though some of the cooks gave me a funny look, that's expected by now...

I ordered a side of rice, and a side of fried yuka. I had to negotiate on them making me a side of JUST YUKA. They have a portion which is a plate and the cost of an entre√©. I spoke to the manager or owner that was present and she was so kind and polite and she agreed on charging me a tad more than a side of fries for the Yuka. They really should add Fried Yuka as a side, it's much tastier than french fries. 

The vegetables were seasoned perfectly. Everything about it was wonderful, it was fully seasoned and cooked to perfection, not raw like you get in most American restaurants, and not soggy like you get in Chinese restaurants. Perfect tenderness!  

The rice was tasty and the fried yuka to die for! 

The people that were there were so friendly that it really makes it feel like a place one can become a local at. 

My compliments to the chef and to the people who run the place. I had a great experience and will certainly return!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service and an amazing experience. The pious as are high quality with great taste. The \"empanadas de pl√°tano con leche\" are amazing. Very happy with my experience. Will definitely be a go to place in Vegas."}
{"text":"Lol got lost in vegas and found the best place to eat pupusas. who would thought that Las Vegas had the best salvodore√±ian food in town. I loved their seafood soup or as they call it caldo de siete mares.. workers are friendly and attentive..prices aren't that bad either."}
{"text":"Pupusas are cheap and very very good will definitely be back! Love the wide array of menu items too :-)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat pupusas! People is really nice and the food is great! Love it!"}
{"text":"Drove all the way across town to try this place.... made it 15 mins before closing and they already had doors closed although they had people inside... the lady saw me standing there and purposely ignored me. Super rude and unprofessional. Stick to your hours or change them."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent, and the prices are very reasonable, but know this:

Pupusas cook slowly, so it takes a while to get your order. The chicken tacos are fantastic and will come out quicker. The tacos are very healthy portions!

Despite the long waits the food is good and the place is nice.  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Great authentic food all fresh to order. Family environment with some big screen tv if you like
Soccer. First time here and not the last."}
{"text":"This place has some really good pupusas but the customer service can sometime be great and other times be horrible but the food food makes up for it!!"}
{"text":"My sister and I ate here and the food is classically Salvadoran. Yummy, low cost and authentic. We ordered: chicken papus, pork papusa, chicken tamale, seafood cocktail, sweet plantains, chicken taco and a cola champagne. Everything was tasty and we left totally stuffed. The bill was $21."}
{"text":"Worst no flavor food ever. I bought 2 steak tacos they had zero flavor to them amd really dry. Waste of $9dollars"}
{"text":"Very casual place. Good food for good prices. This is a place to take the whole family and not break the bank. Camarones empanizados and a pilsener beer is my favorite! And I always take some pupusas to go. Service is also very good"}
{"text":"I like going here because it's near Hobby Lobby and across from the Galleria Mall. The pupusas are delicious, hand-made as soon as you order. The price is very reasonable and everything on the menu looks very good. I've been here a couple of times and the service is good, a little slow on the order, but it's hand-made to order. Either way, this place is a winner. Good food, good service. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! If you have never had a pupusas you are missing out! Fantastic service and really good food. A great secret of Las Vegas"}
{"text":"My favorite.

Even in California; I still crave for this specific location. Friendly, and the food is bomb !"}
{"text":"Service was blah and the beans were burnt. If you like pupusas, this place is great. Don't confuse this place with Mexican fare.  Again the pupusas were awesome!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I honestly found my new quick snack fix in Henderson!  Only $1.75 for a hot, delicious pupusa?! Seriously?  I'm there any day of the week!  Stop by here if you need a homemade, cheesy meal.  Oh and try their take out, it might be quicker"}
{"text":"Amazing,authentic, El Salvadorean pupusas and tamales. Our family LOVES when I bring these home!"}
{"text":"Good pupusas are always found in seedy-looking areas, but the interior here is surprisingly well-appointed. Pricing is super-low, $2/ea is a bargain for the size of the 'pusas here- they're filling, cheesy, and served with the perfect coleslaw and tomato sauce.

Added on an order of yucca frita, not realizing it was an entr√©e plate including chicharrones but the order was good- I prefer my yucca super salty and garlicky, and this wasn't quite that, but it was still a good portion size and very crispy.

Service is friendly- don't be afraid to make a phone in order, even if they answer in spanish the phone is quickly passed to someone who can take your order and fill it correctly."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars was because the food is delicious, but the waitresses are so rude no type of personality, we said please and thank you after everything GB we asked for,  and she responded with just a I don't care look on her face,  the food is good but I just rather go to the other location,  no tip for this lady!"}
{"text":"Love the good but it always takes so long and if you wanna call ahead to pick up good luck cause the phone is always busy"}
{"text":"Pretty good Pupusas! I ordered 3 bean/cheese and 3 cheese. I normally enjoy the bean/cheese the best but from here the cheese was bomb. They were super fresh but a little on the greasy side. The ladies were very nice and friendly. Prices were good about $2"}
{"text":"I would have gave the place a solid 2.5 stars if they didn't screw up my order and leave two $10.99 Chili relleno meals out when they gave it to me. I decided to try this place since its new in my neighborhood, all I can say is I tried it once and that is good enough for me. The food was okay, but the pupusas were really oily or greasy and made with flour instead of corn.    The staff was okay, they did their job except for the screwed up order. The restaurant was clean since it was new. Overall I cant recommend them if my family or friends asked about the place."}
{"text":"Don't let the name or outside appearance keep you from trying this place. My Puerto Rican friend introduced this place to me and I was not disappointed. I like to try new foods and cuisine. I tried the pupusas and it was delish. Why was I not aware that this existed. I tried the chicken and cheese and it dripped with flavors especially when paired with the cabbage slaw. I also tried their carne asada tacos and they were da bomb. I will definitely visit this place again. Give it a try and you won't be disappointed. I will be coming here more often and less often to Robertos."}
{"text":"The food here is really good. I usually get the steak dinner and it is awesome. The pupusas are to die for and they're very filling. I also like the sauce that you can put on them. It's nice having a meal here and drinking a beer with it. We don't eat here in the summer though because they don't have air conditioning. It's a small restaurant and the grill takes up a huge part of it and it gets hot! We usually eat there in the winter time. That's why I took off two stars. Also they're reasonably priced just wait till it cools off."}
{"text":"Something about this place wasnt quite right on this visit. And neither is my stomach at the moment.   The pupusas I ordered were fine, but the tamales I had tasted  different and felt stale and also had a funny odor to it. I only took a few bites and left the rest. Since I was sitting right by the window where you can view the employees make pupusas, the area I saw did not seem as clean as before, lots of dried bits of masa all over the board and Im not sure if food left on the boards are stored at proper temps.  (ie has that tub of masa been sitting there all day?) .. Noted different employees working also. Service is still the same  My server was friendly."}
{"text":"I tried one calabasa/cheese pupusa and one  bean/cheese pupusa.  The calabasa pupusas was pretty good, the beans had no flavor, nor did the curtido and salsa.  Nothing had any spice to it and the curtido tasted like it did not have any vinegar in it at all, and there was not any evidence of crushed rep peppers or sliced jalapenos, both necessary for authentic and tasty curtido.

I am now in the mid-west and was looking forward to some good pupusas.  Sigh!"}
{"text":"Location is a little hidden but food was delicious. We shared the shredded beef plate, al pastor tacos, and carne asada tacos. Beans, rice and salsa that accompanied the beef plate were very satisfying too. Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"food is on point and i love hispanic food. extremely authentic. you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Horario de servicio...\"9am hasta las 9:30 pm.\" (Supuestamente)
   Vine a comer mi postre favorito(flan casero riqu√≠simo) @8:45 pm y resulta que estaba cerrado y no me dejaron entrar. 
 Que pasa con el horario?"}
{"text":"First time I visited this place last week and never had a pupusa but it was an outstanding experience.  The waitress was wondering why I was ordering so much food because I had no idea how large a Pupusa was which is about the size of a pancake personally I would stick with trying the Revuelta if it's your first time then the chicken if you still have room."}
{"text":"We ordered 20 pupusas 12 mixed and the rest cheese. I felt like there was way too little filling. We usually go to the one Desert Inn and they load theirs with filling. This is our second visit here and on the first visit were really good."}
{"text":"I tried the pupusas, how did they get the meat and cheese in there?! They were delicious! I can't believe I've never had them before. The restaurant was very clean and the service was great. You can watch the cook make the food too."}
{"text":"Las pupusas Stan bien y el resto d la comida no sta tan mal. Pero el servicio es pura \"MIERDA\" como decimos los Salvadore√±os. Cuando llegas al restaurante miras las mesas llenas, pero de puros platos sucios. Las meseras tienen una actitud muy repugnante y son muy pasmadas. Es una lastima q la due√±a no tome cartas en el asunto para mejorar el servicio tan \"KULERO\" y \"MIERDA\" q dan. Tantito mas el curtido est√° muy deshabrido, o sea del asco. Due√±a del local no sea coda, e invierta un pokito m√°s en vinagre para darle sabor al curtido y la salsa ni se diga ya mejor den agua en vez d salsa est√° terrible tambi√©n. Y d q sirve q tengan tantas pantallas si est√°n apagadas todas yo me pregunto si ser√°n d adorno. Vale pa' pura \"VERGA\"!!!!!!!!.....,"}
{"text":"Excellent pupusas. Great prices and friendly service. You can even see into the kitchen to see them making the pupusas."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place after my daughters soccer practice. It's a little very traditional Latin restaurant. We were served right away and I ordered pupusas which are very cheap and filling( I only ate one I was too full) my daughter ordered a cheeseburger! She loved it. So for the price it was great, and I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Recently I placed a phone order with Viviana.  I ordered a chilaquiles and a taco. When my son came back home from picking up the order, we discovered that he had been given tilapia and a taco.  My son took the order back and explained to Viviana that we had ordered the Chilaquiles, not the tilapia.  Viviana checked the tab, spoke to the other girl in the restaurant, and told my son that he had ordered the tilapia and that is what she gave him.  Viviana didn't admit she was wrong, did not offer to replace the order, just stared at my son so he left.
When I called to question Viviana, she admitted finally that she got the order wrong, and to bring the order back, but the damage was done.  Insinuating that your customers are liars is not good business practice!"}
{"text":"Not even a good morning --- employees not even engaging with customer - left 17 minutes away just fine a good place"}
{"text":"Food is amazing here. Fair prices, and really friendly staff even if there was a language barrier (i dont speak spanish). Great place overall, and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The pupusas are the best in Las Vegas. I've been a customer for years, and no other place makes them as delicious as they do. The reason why I'm giving them 4 stars is because the service is dissatisfying because they took 45 minutes to make me 3 pupusas.
Order a pick up, visiting and ordering there takes a while."}
{"text":"While I agree with others that maybe some special spices and salt could enhance the flavors a little better our overall experience was a good one. I tried a chicken pupusa ams a mixed one. The mixed was by far the better tasting one, my wife got a tamale amd she liked it just fine, although we have a guy that passes by our door selling tamales and those are way better lol. Overall, we will be back if we want pupusas."}
{"text":"Went here and ordered their chicken burrito, pork and cheese Pupusas, and their al pastor taco. All were good. I added cheese and sour cream on my burrito. Burrito was my favorite by far. The chicken was crunchy and tasty. And not dry. Followed by the Pupusas and the taco. Definitely above average food and although it is a Mexican restaurant per se, it satisfied my Mexican food craving."}
{"text":"Apparently Yelp hides reviews written in Spanish or sends them to the bottom.  Being that this restaurant is a Latin restaurant where most clients speak Spanish, I wrote my review in Spanish but here's my review in English.

THREE TIMES, I have received bad food!  I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone for Salvadorean food.

I tried to give the place a chance but after three times of the same bad food, I just decided its best to let go.

The chicken or fish dinner plates are horrible.  The meat itself is dry and it seems they are not fresh.  When these complaints are brought to the staffs and subsequently to the owners attention they simply are indifferent and do nothing to resolve the problem.

The last time, I ordered to go and was so angry after I got home and discovered a poorly cooked and tasting fried fish. Gross. I immediately called and over the phone the owner offered to refund the money or another replacement dinner the following day as they were closing for the night. So I was without dinner that night and had to put something simple and quick at home. 

The next day and the following days after, nobody wanted to do good on their word of giving me a replacement dinner, even though the owner claimed he would leave a note to inform his staff in charge.  i didn't even want my money but after a few days i demanded a refund, and it was then that they offered to replaced the fish, the fish ONLY because they felt that was the only thing that was not to par.  seriously?lol i laughed at their lack of professionalism.  who buys a dinner plate just for one of the items? a dinner plate is made up of all the items on it to provide you with a delicious eating experience. that means the salad, the rice as well.  so that day they only gave me a fish! LOL i felt that i was transported to El Salvador, a third world country.  Certainly thats the only place where they would think this to be good business practice.

They're a joke! The food is horrible. The chicken and fish is not fresh. Even the second fish was in the same condition.  One of the waitresses even made a comment that's how they do things. She even suggested ordering pupusas as they tend to have less issues with that, some times.  

Only because you are a Latin restaurant that doesn't mean you have to provide a substandard service.  There are many other Latin restaurants that do a great job.  This place needs to take notes from them."}
{"text":"Overpriced! Their online website has the menu with prices but they said the Las Vegas Blvd location prices are more expensive than what they show on the menu. Scammers!!!"}
{"text":"Great hospitality and comfort food goodness! This was my first experience with Salvadoran food and pupusas.

Pupusas are delicious grilled hot pockets. Our cashier recommended the mixed but Yelp reviews clued us into the cheese. We also ordered two tamales: chicken and pork. We also got the fried yucca and pork.

The pupusas were amazing. Savory goodness gooey in the bread. The mixed pupusas is a must try. We adored the cheese pupusas. The cheese pulls gorgeously! When you eat it with the homemade tomato sauce, it was like a grilled cheese and tomato soup combination.

The fried yucca was so flavorful and crispy on the outside. The fried pork was also super crispy. They also give you a cabbage salad that is lightly drizzled with vinaigrette.

The tamales were steamed with a small sheet of banana leaf. The corn was steamed on the soft and wetter side. The chicken filling was super tasty. The pork was alright. 

Finally, the Salvadoran horchata was so different from Mexican horchata. Less sweet with a smoky bitter note from the toasted cocoa! I liked it!

Our meal felt like eating food prepared from  grandma's recipes. I felt like eating food in someone's home."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant on yelp while in Vegas. I have to tell you that if you are looking for great salvadoran food, look no further!  The best yucca con chiccarone I've had in 25 years. The papusas were extraordinary. The plantains were perfection!  
Prices are great, servers friendly. Las Papusas is the real deal!  Can't wait to visit again!!"}
{"text":"Love this place so much! So tasty, a little fills you up, and very cheap. Really you can't go wrong. I hope they get more business now they have moved to the corner of Whitney and Sunset."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. The pupusas are fresh made with cabbage and homemade sauce. Super ONO!"}
{"text":"Food was bland. Horchata was really spicy.
I would recommend going to a different pupusa place."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT! I was looking for a small local and delicious restaurant with different menu items than the \"regular food\" I can get anywhere else. This place hit the spot! The staff was friendly the place was clean. I got there around 1015 and it only took about 5 minutes for my food to be done. I even ordered some to go and took it to my boyfriend! YUMYUMYUM! You gotta eat here (: oh and they make their own bread. Who could ask for more?!"}
{"text":"I come here JUST for the pupusas. For $1.75 on chicken, revuelta, chicharron, cheese etc. I only need two because it fills me up quick.

I usually order over the phone and it's quick & convenient. 

Short review. Bottom line: just order the pupusas."}
{"text":"Great food and location. Clean and nicely decorated . friendly staff . Affordable just priced right . Missing the Pilseners but will be back."}
{"text":"I hate leaving this review, but these were arguably the worst pupusas I've ever eaten. 

I ordered a loroco, a cheese, and a pork. I could easily identify the pork and the cheese, but the loroco had zero filling. I think they forgot to fill it, because if was just masa. It was so greasy it fell apart and was inedible. It tasted like old grease that wasn't hot enough. The escebeche and sauce were both in little ziplock bags which was a car disaster waiting to happen, so I returned those to the counter before even leaving the restaurant. 

The cheese was burned on one side, and it was also extremely oily. 

The pork pupusa was the best; it wasn't oily like the others, and was lightly charred on one side which created a nice texture. 

The restaurant space was huge, lots of stone finishes - it was attractive and lots of seating. The staff was very friendly and if 2/3 pupusas hadn't been inedible, this could have easily been a 4 star experience."}
{"text":"The food was great but the service didn't match. The guy who took our order, i had to repeat myself several times what i wanted. He acted like he heard me the first time then goes, \"im sorry. What?\" Then, after he brought the food, i asked if they had any limes. He looked at me and paused and said \"let me go ask\" he said he asked and came back and said they didnt have any. I went up to the counter myself and asked if they had any and they gave me some limes. Dont lie to me and act like you did ask if you didnt. If i had to go up and ask myself and they gave me some, you obviously didnt do it yourself."}
{"text":"While I've only had the papusas, this is a really nice place! Friendly staff! I will be back for sure to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"my co-worker finally talked me into going here for lunch at work. got a steak torta which was the best torta ive had ever! and then for the first time i tried a pupusas i got the mixed one. it was good. and i will try them again, and get some other ones next time."}
{"text":"This place is tasty! 

I had a chicharron and a bean & cheese papusa. They were delicious. At $1.75 per papusa, they're a bargain.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I like to come here to eat pupusas. The price is cheap and food is very good.  Must try."}
{"text":"This place has delicious pupusas!  I've been to both locations and both seem to have comparable quality. 

The menu is large, but it's honestly very difficult to order anything but the scrumptious pupusas. An old friend introduced me to this Salvadoran food, and it is safe to say that I have finally found an acceptable option for when his mom isn't cooking up a giant batch to share with friends and family. 

My only complaint is that they do not give enough of the cabbage when you order to go or carry out. Good homey vibes and an inexpensive, filling meal every time!"}
{"text":"Today I wanted some Mexican food before I flew out of Las Vegas so I used this app to find a near by location. I was very happy that a restaurant was near by. So we all entered ( my family ) and we order our foos from the counter. Well I ordered the steak fajita platter. Well our dish finally arrived after waiting almost 40 minutes and there were only 8 customers inside the place. 
Well I was not a very good camper because the ratings were high and the food or my food especially was not looking good at all. The meat was very stuff the vegetables were soggy the beans were runnie and the rice looked and tasted like it came out of a box. I was pisst and to top it off I became sick immediately after we left the place. I had to pull off the road and I had to open my drivers door and I let it all out. 
So word from the wise you may enter at your own risk I will never refer anyone to this place."}
{"text":"Let me paint you a picture.....a mental picutre; I'm not Bob Ross (no matter how much I wish).  We had around and hour before we had to leave for a show just off the strip.  My wife picked La Pupusas.  I was worried it would be fairly packed cause it was around lunch time. I was wrong.  There was 1 other group in the resteraunt and we got our order in  right away.  They make the pupusas fresh to order.  I got the bean and cheese, and cheese and herb.  I loved the bean and cheese.  My wife enjoyed her chicken and cheese.  They're also pretty cheap.  Great place for cheap delicious meal.

One tip.  You just go in and sit where ever you want.  Then they'll serve you.  We didn't know this, so we looked like tourist talking to the lady at the counter ordering and looking around like a couple of goofs."}
{"text":"Prices are a little higher but it is on strip for me it's convenient because it's close to home food was just as good as other location service needs a little improvement but it is a kid taking orders so. Called in my order in was fast and easy to pick up"}
{"text":"Love this place. when you come inside the Decour reminds you of El Salvador . The service is great we sat down and the waitress came right away we took our food to go. The pupusas are nice and hot not to greasy because some pupusas are greasy it comes with the sauce and the cabbage to  put on top. Always come here"}
{"text":"*Before any of you complain about the Horchata (as someone complained below), realize that it is EL SALVADORIAN horchata. COMPLETELY different.*
     I hadn't had El Salvadorian food in such a long time and we had accidentally ended up at this place. The prices were fantastic, the Pupusas, Yucca frita and the plantains were all phenomenal. Everything that we ordered that was El Salvadorian was great. The waitress was kind and the place was nice. The only reason I am not giving it five stars is because the Mexican food there was pretty good, but not their specialty. If you are in the neighborhood for some fantastic Central American fare, stop by this place for enough food to feed a family of five for about 40 bucks... as long as you choose wisely, of course ;-)"}
{"text":"Amazing food, authentic and so delicious. Made Fresh. 
The Staff are so friendly and so eager to serve. 
Great parking and a huge selection of food to pick from.."}
{"text":"Delicious. =) I had the pupusa with the beans and cheese and the hot wings and I thoroughly enjoyed it all. The staff was friendly as well. =)"}
{"text":"This restaurant was clean there was plenty of parking there's plenty of seating and the waitress was very friendly and the staff was very professional the price is very reasonable I had a taco which was ok tasting there was a plenty of it for a dollar 95 and it was fresh cooked my friend had the breakfast spicy eggs and ham and she said the taste was very good there was a large portion for the money I ordered two pupusas the bean cheese and chicken and the bean and cheese for the money there was a lot of food there but there was very little meat beans and cheese mostly tortilla and they were very greasy in my opinion this is a restaurant that offers a lot of carbohydrates for a very reasonable price so if you're hungry and broke this would be the place to go if you're looking for more substance and protein choose another restaurant"}
{"text":"If I could give this location zero stars I would do so exuberantly. 

We came to this restaurant in hopes that we could finally have a wonderful little pupusa joint near home to go to frequently and left utterly shattered of that hopeful dream. 

The pupusas were 90% dough and 10% filling. We could discern the entire circumference 3/4s of an inch in was pure dough. The dough was so thick however that heat struggled to penetrate it and left it rather raw.
They were NOT the stable, thoroughly stuffed, warm delicacies I've loved for years. And at $2.25 a pupusa, I'm sorry, but we didn't pay to fill up on nearly uncooked dough.

On top of that, the house 'hot sauce' tasted quite literally like watery remnants of a store bought Pace salsa. And lastly, the horchata? Tasted burnt. How do you burn horchata? :( 

All in all: 0/5
We won't be returning and will gladly drive half an hour to our usual hole in the wall for quality food."}
{"text":"Las Pupusas is actually in the corner of Valley View Blvd. and Desert Inn.This has always been one of my favorite Salvadorian/Mexican restaus here in town. Workers are so nice, I like the way they help customers whenever. Food was so delicious! Came in with an empty stomach and left with a fatty one. Hahaha. My boyfriend and I usually comes here all the time. Patience is a must cause it kinda takes a little time for you to get your order but it's all worth it, you got the good stuff, big portion. Fried chicken with all the veggies stuff is bomb, it wasn't spicy and salty. Mi novio got the breakfast one, everything was so good!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food at a great price. Had never heard of Pupusas until this week and ended up going for lunch twice. However, lack of servers make for an extremely slow dining experience so be prepared to have a long lunch."}
{"text":"First of all the Pupusas were very good. Fresh. The Calamari was good as well, breaded and fried just right. The pork chop however was over cooked to the point of being dry, hard and with no seasoning. I wanted to see how it would be served ( with grilled vegetables ). I guess next time I'll stick to Pupusas."}
{"text":"I've only been there once, so far.  I ordered the Chicken burrito and for my taste, it's the best I've had on this side of town.  I'll be going back, for sure.  

Nice people as well.

Great Job!"}
{"text":"Food is good, prices are great, but nothing to write home about. Keep an eye out for the $0.99 charge for every card transaction though. Blech."}
{"text":"I haven't been to too many Salvadorian restaurant, so I can't really compare this one. What I do know is that I love this place. I get the pupusas from here and lick my fingers every time. It is a treat having this restaurant so close to my house. The staff is friendly, their menu is both in English and Spanish, the place is always clean and, of course, the food is delicious. If your ever on this side of town or staying at a casino near by, venture out to Las Pupusas and have authentic Salvadorian food."}
{"text":"I normally never give poor reviews. But this place was horrible. 

First when you walk in you expect it to be more of a hole in the wall than a nice dining room experience so I won't elaborate on the dirty tables and floors and lack of having a health department grade posted.
But even if it was a complete dive, the food should be decent or at least edible.

I tried this place out because of a recommendation from a Hispanic friend. I was anticipating great mexican food, but got a healthy dose of stingy, chewy carne asada and uncooked (raw ) round disks of dough ( which apparently are supposed to be tortillas.) the meat had no flavor and was full of grissle and tendons, the refered beans were more like refries bean soup and the rice was bland and lack luster. My fresh tomato on my plate had the sticker from the grocery store still on it ( gross.) I was completely appalled when I took my to go order back to work on my lunch break to find all This. So depressing since I spent 9 bucks on something I couldn't eat. 

Let's say I will NEVER go back and will NEVER recommend this Resteraunt to anyone! Ever."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for years. I recently discovered a new location opening near my castle, so I had to check it out. The restaurant has two entrances, one on the east side and one on the west side which is where I entered, \"because, you and I know it's tha best side.\" -2pac lol 

To my surprise the owner Luis was in the building. He was courteous, polite and inviting, glad we had the chance to chit chat. The rest of the staff were also kind and all had smiling faces, obviously, happy to be working there. 

I decided on a traditional Salvadorian breakfast, pupusas and some nachos native to the country. All the food was piping hot and delicious. The fried plantains on the breakfast dish were outstanding. It was also the first time I had nachos served without cheese which is how they're traditionally served in El Salvador. The chips tasted like they had just come out the fryer, light, crispy and crunchy. 

I'm definitely looking forward to exploring the Mexican menu on my next visit as well as the Salvadorian desserts. This place is worth checking out and don't even think about not ordering at least one order of pupusas. Rock on!"}
{"text":"These had to have been the best pupusas I've ever tasted - and the largest!  We got two pupusas each for an appetizer and a meal.  The pupusas were enormous and the platter (pollo asado) was piled high.  I can't wait to go back and try the corn tamales.  

The prices are very reasonable; the staff was so friendly and most importantly the food was so delicious.  I can't wait to go back !"}
{"text":"Yummy pupuas. A clean and very welcoming place to eat at. Another favorite place to eat at and the pupuas are a very good size and priced very good."}
{"text":"Best Carne Asada burrito in town. The Pupusas are all made to order and are of excellent quality. The prices are reasonable as well. I took off one star for bad service I have received a few times when placing take out orders but the food itself makes up for it."}
{"text":"I haven't had a Pupusa in a good long time, about 7 years. I saw it on my way to get some fast food on an all too quick lunch break. I figured, lets go for some variety. I went for the mixed pupusa, for $2 you get a really filling meal of the pupusa (kind of like a huge corn tortilla that is filled with your choice of fillings. The mixed is cheese, beans and pork) with a side of sliced cabbage and a vineagar dressing.  
Totally filling, totally a bargain. I have gone back twice now, for the exact same thing. I suspect I will do this for a while until I tire of this one dish and try the tamal or Yucca tamal (looks so much like a pastele from PR)

Ambiance is ok, very fast food. The girl behind the counter is friendly enough. Bathroom is clean. So far, so good."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum, I love pupusas!

I came here with my mom and sister. We all ordered pupusas revueltas (cheese,beans,pork) and I also got a side of plantains, beans, and cream. They gave us a bowl of curtido (cabbage slaw w/ chiles and vinegar) and a bottle of tomato salsa to share. The pupusas came out very nice and hot. They were so hot that I had to wait a few minutes to dig in (that's how you know they're fresh). I always tend to drown my pupusas in the tomato salsa because it's soo good, but I noticed that no one else really does that. The waitress kept on checking on us to make sure we were always well stocked. We ended up getting 2 bowls of the curtido because we were all eating big forkfuls of it (so fresh and tasty). I actually got 3 pupusas which was two too many. They're very filling, so I suggest you just get one or two, especially if you're going to get beans or whatever else on the side. The fried plantains were just how my parents make them at home. Perfectly cooked, soft, not overly sweet, and delicious with the cream and beans. 

Pros:
*Very fresh pupusas
*Yummy curtido and tomato salsa
*Fast, friendly service
*Large menu (they also have tacos, burritos, burgers, fries, etc)
*Authentic food
*Cheap prices (we spent less than $25 for 3 people)

Cons:
*The location is kind of in the middle of nowhere, but that makes this more of a \"locals\" joint, which is a good thing!

Tips
*Don't order revueltas if you're not big on cheese. I gave my boyfriend one and he said it was too cheesy. Stick to just pork or beans
*Try the fried plantains with the cream and beans!
*Ask the waitress for more time to look at the menu. She tends to come by kind of fast and you want to make sure you go through the whole menu before ordering."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating a pupusa.  I had the revueltos pupusa - pork, beans, and cheese - and a chicken tamale.  Lisa L. got two pupusas - chicken and cheese/herbs.  I liked the tomato sauce and vinegar-based slaw that came with it.  I would return to try other dishes.  The place is new so it is clean."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast!! They moved! They are now on sunset and Whitney ranch. GREAT FOOD!!"}
{"text":"It's overhyped. I loved Esmeralda's before they shut it down. Ordered pork and cheese pupusas. Cheese was tasty but the pork had no taste. Even the tomato salsa and curtido were just ok. Pretty disappointed but what should I expect taking advice from Mexicans and Asians who don't have a tongue for salvadorean food. If your full Salvi like me don't buy into the hype. This place is just OK."}
{"text":"Loved their Squash with cheese pupusas! Honesty when it come down to authentic salvadorian food you must try them here! Beside they are huge and I easily get stuffed with 2! Try them and to drink make sure to try their kolachampan (salvadorian soda) I so recommend for you guys to try them out!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness.  I have never had pupusas before, so now I don't have a basis for comparison, but now I wonder what I have been waiting for.  I ordered take out and my order came out quickly.  The staff members were both friendly.  I ordered two mixed pupusas (I asked the server what her favorite kind was) and an el pastor taco.  The total was less than $6... perfect for a student on a budget!  The taco was just ok in my opinion, but I am admittedly a bit stuck up when it comes to my tacos.  One thing I can say about the taco was that it was definitely packed and there was no skimping on the ingredients.  The pupusas are the way to go - I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I moved out here from New York and have missed my mom's cooking for the longest time. I have gone to many different places to try their pupusas and tamales, sopas you name it. Nothing comes close to this place. Their tamales are literally some of the best I've had, takes me back to my childhood. That good. It's not perfect some hiccups here and there but still a great place, and great food."}
{"text":"Used to be a good spot about 2 years ago but quality is very hit or miss now. Sometimes I get amazing pupusas, but more often than not I get completely dry, empty pancakes. Their horchata isn't as great anymore either. 

Also, twice in a row I've caught them inflating my tab (charged double tax first time and second time my check was somehow $5 more) and withholding my receipt, so be very careful when paying and make sure you get a receipt. I think from now on I'll drive a little more to not get ripped off."}
{"text":"I love their food here. They prep the food fest and the place is very clean and neat inside. The staff is very friendly and charming."}
{"text":"Delicious!! The service was ehh but I don't really expect amazing service from places that aren't specialized in American food. Very inexpensive and delicious!"}
{"text":"For a a year now, my Salvadorian friend has been teasing me about going out for pupusas.  The day finally came.  We were at a convention not too far from Las Pupusas, and he said today was the day.  Naturally I was pretty excited.  This day was a year in the making.  My buddy told me that the pupusas here are good and pretty much the same stuff he grew up on.

We got in around 2pm.  First thing I noticed was that the restaurant was pretty big.  Lots of seating.  Dove into the menu and I started asking questions.  His go to is the standard cheese pupusa.  But I felt adventurous so I got a loroco (herbs and cheese) and a revuleto (beans, chichorron, and cheese).  And got an order of pork pasteles (deep fried dumpling with shredded pork filling).  I found out very quickly that the Salvadorian version of chichorron is not the same as the mexican way.  The Salvadorian version is actually pork meat, not the pork skins.  The service was good, the waitresses spoke Spanish and perfect English.  I had no problems ordering my food.  

So, the pupusas come with curtido (pickled cabbage) and salsa roja (tomato sauce condiment).  I piled the curtido on top of my pupusas, drowned them in salsa roja, and a heavy helping of tapatio hot sauce.  First up was the loroco.  The dough is nice and thick.  It soaks up all the salsa roja and does not disintegrate, holds up very well.  I don't know what kind of herb the loroco is, but it is a bit floral and quite tasty.  The cheese was ooey and gooey, melted to perfection.  The curtido adds a nice crunch and very complimentary to the soft and doughy pupusa.  The revuleto was mostly cheesy with shreds of pork here and there.  I could really taste the frijoles, which is a good thing as I'm not a huge fan of them.  Or maybe I just drowned them out with the curtido and salsa roja.  The chicharron added some taste and texture to the pupusa, although the pupusas aren't overstuffed, you definitely taste the meat.  Both pupusas were very tasty in their own right.  But that curtido and salsa roja really put them over the top for me.  Really liking this dish.

Time for the pasteles.  These shredded pork filled dumplings reminded me of Indian samosas. They both have a similar bite and texture to them, although the filling is quite different.  According to my buddy, these pasteles are some of the best he has ever had.  Being that this was my first time eating them, all I can say is they were delicious!  

One of the best parts of the meal was the bill.  at $2 a pupusas, you really can't go wrong.  I ordered 2 pupusas and a order of pasteles (3 large pieces), I was overstuffed, I could only eat 2 of the pasteles.  

My pro tip would be to order 2 pupusas and share an order of pasteles.  For the really big appetite, 3 pupusas and share some pasteles.  if you go for 4 pupusas, you'll be super full and need someone to roll you out in a wheel barrel."}
{"text":"If it wasn't because the food is good at this location i would of given this place a 1 star. i just called to order take out and the lady who answer (ines or irma) wasn't very nice. i was ordering pupusas and placing 3 different orders. i asked for the amount for each order i placed and she told me that each pupusa was 2 dollars. i asked her for the total and she told me she was busy. ummm i asked her to be nice...and she said that she had a line of customers and she didn't have time plus she was the only one in the restaurant. (even though i wanted to hang up and be rude i just said have a good day and cancel my order.) she was probably having a bad day"}
{"text":"Called earlier for an order, we get here and the order hasn't been placed! Why accept calls for orders when we have to wait 20 more mins?!?!?! Makes no sense.  anyone knows another cheap place for pupusas? This place just stakes too long for an order."}
{"text":"Nice looking place but the service sucks. Every order in my party was screwed up multiple times. I might go back but it will be a while I had high hopes. Total let down lol."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go to for a quick yet delicious bite with either family or on my own. I've been going to their many locations all over Vegas for over 5 years and this one on Valley View is by far my favorite. They've got a great atmosphere going and awesome customer service. I was first introduced to this place by my stepfamily and haven't stopped going ever since because it's just that great. So if you're ever nearby I encourage you to stop by and check them out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"If You Want Some Good Salvadorian Pupusas This Is The Place To Go To The Waitress Was Nice And The Food Was Delicious"}
{"text":"I come here at least a couple times a month and absolutely love the revuelta pupusas and the pork pasteles.  The curtido that's served with the pupusas is delicously crunchy with just a slight kick.  At first I didn't like the red sauce that is also served on the side (I found that it wasn't spicy enough for me) but I've come to really enjoy it and my pupusas aren't complete if I don't have the sauce drizzled (okay, dumped) all over it.

Food always comes out quickly and hot--I have always gotten take out and by the time I get back to work the foil-wrapped pupusas are still piping hot.  By the way, I love when the cheese spills out while on the grill...it's like a bonus, that crispy crunchy grilled cheese, yum!

I've only eaten in the restaurant once.  Service was adequate.  Their version of the horchata isn't the same as Mexican horchata though; I wasn't a fan.  Perhaps someday I'll venture away from the pupusas and pasteles and try some of the other items on their menu but for now, I still haven't gotten sick of them.  (Yay!)"}
{"text":"I had their pupusas, which were good and cheap. It does take a long time for them to cook the food, but they make it fresh. The pupusas are so big, I ordered three and was only able to finish too. If you're looking to be full for cheap and don't mind the grease, then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good pupusas. Either the pupusas are bad or the curtido. These are so good and so is the curtido! I go every time I'm in Las Vegas. 

They are so cheap! You honestly could feed a family of 5 with $20."}
{"text":"The pupusas were amazing and we also ordered buffalo strips which were not half bad. The only reason I'm giving this a three star is because the waitress lacked good customer service. We must have been sitting there fifteen minutes after we had asked her for refills, instead she decided to help other customers and eat at the counter. We were literally watching her eat and drink a nice refreshing iced tea while we waited for refills. That was very annoying. We will definitely be going back.. But this time we will order out."}
{"text":"I love good fresh pupusas and you will find them  here!

 We ordered the chicken, pork, and bean and cheese. I was partial to the pork and rice and cheese and can't  wait to sample more. It is fun  to watch them being freshly made in the window while you eat. Word to the wise, if it is summer, you may want to stay away from the glass because it is warm. Hats off to the pupusas maker!

It is a real inexpensive deal, $2 and eating even one it is filling, two you are stuffed!  When I went the tables were clean and they kept themclean with a high turnover during that time. It is Salvadorean fast food, not the Strip! 

Enjoy your trip to South America! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food, especially the pupusas. Pretty big place with friendly workers and fair prices, definitely will be coming back for more in the near future!"}
{"text":"When it comes to pupusas, this is the place to go to. Very basic flavors but sooo authentic. So reasonable priced! The place is not that fine but it was alright. I always go for take out anyway so it doesnt matter to me. I would highly recommend this place to friends and family!"}
{"text":"Yummy.. Wanted to wait till I finished my last mixta pupusa... Nice staff here. Small hidden place next to Target... There made fresh.. They come with salsa and shredded cabbage. Ofcourse I asked for extra. Had enough for breakfast next day. Next trip out to Henderson I will stop by to this hidden gem... There a mix of Mexican and Salvadorian..."}
{"text":"I spent the past 3 decades finding hidden gems in LA. Now, I have opportunities to explore Henderson / Las Vegas. Looking for a good substitute for that urge for Salvi food. 

The place had tinted Windows,  so don't be fooled, they're open. It's a small, cute spot that can fit 16 tables of 4. Best feature abt this place is the Window into the kitchen that overlooks the tortilla grill (center of restaurant).

I ordered the Ensalada drink (a lightly flavored Apple juice with bits of chopped apples swimming in the drink), their Platanos plate that comes with frijoles & the part that saved the dish,  the Salvadorian creme. You can taste the plantains weren't ripe & had to be overcooked in order to get the right texture. If the plantains were ripe & sweet, that would MAKE the dish complete. And a couple of pupusas reveltas. Big plus was the fressness with the masa (dough), but lacked flavor in my opinion. I had to add salt to get more flavor other than the masa.

Service: to justify, my experience was all around average. They were properly staffed. The atmosphere was welcoming and clean. Nothing too overly done since it's simple. No bathroom visit. 

Will likely return, but not my spot... Just yet."}
{"text":"stopped in today for some salvadorian food :) we wanted to get home in time for the game so we ordered to go.  the restaurant is very small and it was busy around 2pm on sunday. there were 10+ parties and a couple other parties waiting for to-go food. we ordered 5 pork and cheese pupusas and 2 orders of chicharrones w/fried yucca (all to go). the lady at the counter said it was going to be a little bit of a wait and asked if she could bring us one pupusa while we waited.  i thought that was really considerate and we took her up on her offer.  pupusa was served hot w/just a little crunch to the masa.  the cabbage slaw that it comes with was good enough, although it couldve been a little more 'tangy' for my taste.  

overall good eatin and good service! place was clean and people were nice."}
{"text":"After looking at pictures from my trip to Costa Rica, I was craving plantains. I was thinking about hitting up a Cuban spot near my house but, my boyfriend suggested a pupusas place. I've never had pupusas so, I was intrigued.

We entered and it was like a big warehouse type restaurant with lots of tables. We ordered the mixed/combination (cheese, beans, meat) pupusas and plantains. Also, had horchata. My portion was less than $5 so, MAJOR score.

It came with some kinda of slaw and hot sauce. I tried the slaw on my pupusa but, didn't like it too much. Hot sauce, on the other hand, I loved on everything including my plantains.

Anyways, I finished my 1 pupusa and half of my plantains. And I was stuffed. And such a happy lady =)
Everytime I'm in the area, I try to stop in because they're open early and definately a cheap eat!"}
{"text":"We were really craving some good papusas and I wanted to introduce something new to my sister who had never tried them before. We were really happy with our food, but our experience would have been better with some suggestions- 
1) Having a server who speaks english would be great! I love, love, love El Salvadorian food, but it was hard to communicate our needs with our server because she didn't speak english very well- I wish I spoke Spanish, I really do, but I don't! 
2) Stuff for the kids would have been nice- crayons, etc. 
3) A bit overpriced for what I am used to paying for papusas, but I guess it's because it's Vegas and everything is a little more expensive than I am used to. 
4) I didn't get everything I ordered.. my hubby and I ordered one of the same papusas and he got one but I didn't. 

Other good stuff- the restaurant is very nice and clean on the inside- plenty of seating. Also the menu has lots of options to choose from."}
{"text":"La mejor pupuseria que eh probado hasta ahora y la mejor locaci√≥n, se ve limpio... Ser√≠a m√°s que perfecto si las pupusas no las cocinaran tan grasosas porque est√°n ricas y son grandes."}
{"text":"Good pupusas, nice and cheesy. Some say they are too greasy, I think they are just right, curtido has right amount of acidity."}
{"text":"I had the seafood soup and it was good.  Wife had the breaded beef and it was good but not great.  Service was great.  Pork and cheese pupusas were the great (5 out of 5 stars).  I liked that they made them within eye shot.  The Regio lager imported beer was very good too.  Pupusas + imported Salvadorian beer + service earned it four stars."}
{"text":"We ordered the mixed chicken and revueltas (pork, beans, cheese) pupusas. YUM! I especially loved the pork ones.  We loaded them up with the slaw and sauce that came with, and they were awesome!  Two loaded pupusas had me more than full.  We ordered ours to go, and there was plenty of slaw and sauce. We didn't have to ask for more.  Definitely a fan of pupusas!!"}
{"text":"First of all really great papusas!  Found this place on Yelp and it is a sit down restaurant but I got food to go.

Nice little vibe to the place with good service.  Really great food.  Got to try the papusas.  That was our favorite thing that we had on the menu."}
{"text":"Okay, so I am a little biased because I prefer Chinaco 100x over however, since we were in Vegas and were wanting something a little different than buffet, we opted for salvadorean/mexican. 
This place is kinda big, casual - super casual seating. The service is not so good, but the food is just ok. 
I ordered two pupusas, revuelta (pork, cheese and beans) and a calabasa (squash and cheese). I highly reccomend the calabasa as it has a lot of tiny little cubed pieces of squash, seasoning and cheese. 
I didn't like the fact that the salsas were a light pink super transparent watery mess. They tasted like boiled, watered down tomato juice and a hint of oregano."}
{"text":"The prices are great! I would recommend the #12, it has yummy food and comes with tortillas. It's incredibly spacious and the staff is pretty attentive. I went on a Sunday and they have futbol playing on three diferente screens.  My waitress had a little bit of an attitude but overall, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"I noticed how close I was to a milestone 600th review a few days ago. Since then, I've actually been stressing about it somewhat. Should it be another cool non-food destination like #500 (well, actually #499 after a stub-like review removal)? Should it be a hot new restaurant? Should it be a high-end restaurant that I haven't been to?

I guess Yelp may have spoiled the reveal by now... it was none of the above. Instead, I went to an oft-overlooked restaurant in my own neighborhood. Although I have seldom heard about friends' experiences with this restaurant or with pupusas in general, they have all been positive. I decided to act today for lunch.

Las Pupusas is located in the gigantic plaza on Stephanie and Sunset. It is one of several businesses between Hobby Lobby and Ross, and it could qualify as a hole in the wall. It's a little dim inside and the decor seems to try to bring back the feel of El Salvador. The facade-of-sorts over the back area is Mission-style, there are paintings about the old country, and the TV was broadcasting CentroamericaTV. I can make an educated guess that a lot of the patrons are from that part of the world too.

Before I get into the food, I should state that this isn't a place for a quick lunch. It was still slammed after 1pm, with dirty dishes on tables owing to the lack of a busboy. That's right, there was only one employee running the whole front of house. This helps me somewhat mitigate the regret over the missed opportunities for lunch with friends, although we perhaps could have still ordered to-go to fit a visit here into the constraints of a lunch hour.

I'd already browsed the menu, which is available in PDF with prices on their web site, but I had plenty of time to go through it again anyway. To get a feel for the variety of the restaurant, I decided to get a bunch of smaller items. Each of which was conveniently $1.95, which was generally a bargain for what I got. You can build a solid lunch out of 3-4 of these, but I ordered 5.

First, the pupusas. Move over, arepas. While these bad boys aren't as big and there are significant differences, I'll take two of them over one of the arepas from most or all local restaurants when I'm craving something with a thick corn-based container and hot meat and cheese. These pupusas are sealed then cooked, and they have a disc-like shape, resembling a smashed sphere of dough or a flattened hockey puck. They're served with a refreshing, mild slaw on the side, but they don't have any plantains, and the mild tomato sauce is much less interesting than the green sauce that's served with arepas. Regardless, they're delicious.

The revuelta was filled with refried beans, cheese, and \"chicharron,\" a pork that is not at all the same as the fried pork rinds of Mexican cuisine. I actually couldn't decide whether I preferred this to the second pupusa, which was simply chicken with cheese (note: my order could have been less than absolutely specific, but I guess they don't offer a \"revuelta\" with chicken substitution). The corn flavor shined a bit more on the latter, and I couldn't really get much out of the refried beans anyway.

I also tried their take on a pork tamale. Stop me if you know what I'm talking about when I say it bears a small resemblance to a Vietnamese food known as banh chung. While the fluffy corn masa is a far cry from the somewhat sticky rice and mung bean, the chunks of pork and the flavor from the banana leaf wrapping are definitely similar. I'm not sure whether dousing a tamale in that same tomato sauce is typical, and I didn't need more moisture, but an elderly woman who arrived later did just that. Be forewarned that the pork is concentrated in the middle half, so the edges are just corn dough if you decide to eat directionally instead of cutting it apart and evening out the meat and masa.

Finally, I got to the two tacos that I'd ordered. They're not exactly the same fare that you'll get from most popular taco joints. They do start off with two corn tortillas per taco, but the diced tomatoes and shredded lettuce (with traces of onion) are a far cry from the typical cilantro and onion topping. They also lack a variety of salsas, instead providing a side of some ridiculously hot concoction that I'm sure would challenge even the spicy-tolerant.

They're not bad for what they are though. The meat portions are huge, with cube-shaped pieces spilling out when I tried to eat them by hand instead of utensil. Both the carne asada and the al pastor are seasoned well and flavorful. Unfortunately, the carne asada was overcooked and dry (albeit not inedibly chewy), and the al pastor can't compare to some local taquerias. But that's because the latter are marvelous, not because the meat is bad here.

Phew! I'm glad #600 was an overall success. I'll definitely come back to Las Pupusas for their namesake food and perhaps a tamale. I would even consider the entrees, burritos, or tortas, but I just won't expect a fast dine-in meal."}
{"text":"I come here once a month or so! So delicious! The pupusas can be ordered with pork, beans, cheese, or mixed. They also come with curtido lightly pickled cabbage salad, and delicious salsa (a think slightly spicy red sauce). I always order mine mixed with a side of rice. 

Each are made to order and I love how each pupusa is $1.50. The restaurant also features some other Salvadorian and Mexican dishes as well, though it's hard for me to pass of a good pupusa! ;)"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times. Twice now we arrive to dirty tables and NO service. We sit for over 6 minites and no on acknowledges we are even there. And they see us. We make eye contact REALLY??? So we left and went to pupusas 503 on rainbow Blvd and Oakley. Sooooo much better. Just found out new spot!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!!  The service is good and the food is yummy and extremely inexpensive.  I had never had pupusas before my experince here, and it was definitely something i enjoyed!"}
{"text":"This was my first run at Las Pupusas. I had no idea what to expect. I have a friend from El Salvador who recommended it highly. The staff of friendly and will help you through the menu if you need it.

We ordered an assortment of Pupusas. Cheese, bean, and pork. When they arrived I missed which were which and they all look the same until you cut into them. 

No doubt about it, they are tasty, but they are heavy and will sit as such in your stomach. Plan a nap spot afterwards, as you may easily slide into a food coma.

I will head back to explore more of the menu soon!"}
{"text":"I always eat here when I want a good Salvadorian meal..and the service always friendly. I have family who are vegetarians. I suggest the spinach and cheese papusas. Actually all the pupusas are great! Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Best pupusas in town. Very casual dine-in, or take-out is available. Great prices too."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I often order take out for lunch. Today was my turn to pick it up. To my surprise, besides great food, the restaurant was very clean, my order was ready at the scheduled time, and the customer service was good. My favorite is rebuelta pupusa (with everything) and a \"salad\" drink. I would have given 5 stars if they delivered."}
{"text":"Overall compared to many of the go to places, the prices and quality here are very wack.  Expensive and nowhere near as good as a homecooked meal.  It's relatively nice.  Clean, bright, lively employees but there are many other places you can spend your money and time, alone or with friends."}
{"text":"Food was really fresh! Pupusas were really good! The prices are fair. The fried bananas were really good to, I took my food to go so they forgot the cream, but the food was Delish! Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I felt like i was treated like the ugly adopted child here. First they got my order wrong and didn't do anything about it. The horchata had a nasty burnt after taste. Pupusas were mehh... Then they took foreverrrrr to bring our desert. Seriously forever, my testicles were beginning to collect dust. And to top it off one of the flan deserts was burnt. Its not over ladies and gentlemen... Then our check was wrong too. I won't ever be coming back here for sure."}
{"text":"First time around I was short-changed. Second time around they tipped themselves off my debit card when I already tipped in cash. Second time was my fault as I shouldn't have given the place a second chance. Watch your transaction or skip this place entirely!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend the papusas de rebuelto (the mix one). The papusas were good but I like the other locations better. Their papusas are made with with dough. Every bite you take you can barely taste the meat and cheese. Instead you'll get a chunk of flower."}
{"text":"If you've never had pupusas, you're kinda missing out. They're a really simple dish, yet they're so good and so filling! Plus, they're one of the few foods that hasn't gotten big time, like gourmet tacos or burgers. So they're still a relative bargain.

I came to this restaurant with a lady, and we ordered a few pupusas revueltas with some sodas and some strange chocolate-y drink. I've got to admit, the pupusas were good. They were hot, and they seemed like they were made just then. I don't know that they actually were, but still. They were good enough that I will return to this place, despite some of my issues, just for the pupusas. 

The service was slow. Really, really slow. Slow enough that when I wanted to order more food, I had to go out and find someone to help me (the place was empty, btw). Also, they never refilled my water. It took us forever to get more soda (Cola Champan) when the brown mystery drink was put aside.

It sucks that the service here was slow. This place has a lot of potential to step their game up by just upping the service quotient, and it'd definitely be a four-star place... easy."}
{"text":"Presentation is not always pretty but the flavor is great. I recommend having at least 2 or 3 pupusas and the shredded beef plate. It's tender and flavorful with its tomato sauce base and saut√©ed vegetables."}
{"text":"Called to make an order for pick up ... the lady on the phone told me my food would be ready I told her I would be there less than 5 minutes so I headed their way. Just for the girl to try and convince me that I called the wrong location.. then hearing the cool tell her in Spanish that she told her the order wrong & they not knowing I'm fluent in Spanish the lady still try to convince me that I was at fault when calling the wrong location .. and then I still have to tell her that I was still going to order food .. that now I've been waiting 10 minutes for .. which I wouldn't be complaining if she hadn't told me that my order would be ready when I got here . And I even read back the number I called which was the right location and she continued to play it off as if they had no clue ."}
{"text":"I love the pupusas here. Its really the only place we go to have them. The food here is very cheap but descent for the price. My husband likes the horchata & breakfast platter that comes with eggs, beans & yummy plantains. Ive also had the carne asada & al pastor tacos. They aren't the best but they're alright when you're really hungry. The service could be better. I've had a waitress who was attentive & very kind, but when shes not there the service takes pretty long. Also sitting near the restroom you smelly a weird stench which is never pleasant while eating your food. In all if you're looking for a place for some good inexpensive pupusas come to this place."}
{"text":"Wow   el cervicio q dan aqu√≠ en las pupusas es de lo m√°s despacio q puede ver ai 6 personas trabajando avian 3  personas en la caja y ninguna se movi√≥ para atender espere y despu√©s de 15 minutos asta q al fin llego alguien a tomar la orden no tienen nada de amabilidad   pos wowwww  no  en tiendo q esta pasando en este lugar  luego  ped√≠ una or chata  y parec√≠a  chocolate  y  sin sabor  y se queda atorada en la garganta porq no la cuelan.  Ped√≠ una han Burger  sin queso y me la trajeron con queso."}
{"text":"BS +++

Located on S Las Vegas BLVD by the Mall area.  This place is a gem! El Salvadorian, Colombian, and Peruvian food to me are hands down the best.  Their choices are simple and FXCKING AMAZING! Their grilled or fried and just hits home.  Your soul is warm and your stomach is full after coming to visit.  They serve the main dishes with a cup of white rice, a flat bread, refried beans, and a little salad.  I had the grilled chicken! Boy let me tell you if you are dying for healthy dining don't sleep on this spot.  It's next to some hipster Pinoy restaurant.  I  love Pinoy food but hell I would eat this first.  Take it from this foodie.  This spot is legit! Order EVERYTHING!

Food is BOMB
Selection was ON POINT and NOT TOO OVERWHELMING
Restrooms are CLEAN and even has a ladder just in case you're short!
Tables are LUNCH ROOM STANDARDS
Table wait time PLACE WAS EMPTY
Take out wait time is QUICK

{"text":"This place is really good . Came in on a Saturday with the fam . We got to try a little bit of every thing   . Food was good . I like the pupsusa the most . It was really chessely . I got to try the Rellenitos de crema . It was missing the sugar all over it . The horchata was to water down . The service was okay . They would come and check on us all late ."}
{"text":"So yes this place has pupusas but let me tell you.. They have the best yes i said the best carne asada quesadilla! The meat is seasoned and cooked well and i know meat! Lol deff worth a try next time you go, its big so you can split it with someone"}
{"text":"If you are looking for good Pupusas this is the place in the area.
They were done perfect and the price is reasonable.
It is not a fancy place just some tables and chairs but it is all about the food."}
{"text":"Really good pupusas! They're made to order so they are nice and hot when you get them. Yum! I've never tried any of the other menu items since I can't choose anything over a pupusa. At least not in a Salvadorean restaurant... 

My new favorite pupusa is the revuelta (pork, cheese and beans). Their curtido (slaw-type topping) and sauce is really good and goes perfectly on top. 

While it's not my absolute favorite pupusa restaurant in town, it's still pretty tasty. It's closer to home, so when we're too lazy to drive to our favorite place, Las Pupusas does the trick."}
{"text":"The 5 stars is for the pupusas because that's pretty much all we've tried there. They are so delicious and worth the cost and wait because sometimes the wait is a bit long. But overall will keep going there for them!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place after hearing about pupusas. I never had one and wanted to see what they were all about. 

All I can say is \"where have they been all my life?\"

I had the pork carnitas and the GF had the cheese.

Its a small no frills restaurant.

Service was good and prompt.

To those who have never had them, you must try!"}
{"text":"Not Authentic Salvadoran food! They serve Mexican, American, etc. Pupusas do not taste good, a mixed pupusa is just cheese."}
{"text":"Really good Salvadorean flavors, basic menu and friendly enough service.  Wish they'd add a few more items to the menu.  Their Horchata is traditional Central American flavor and fantastic!"}
{"text":"The revuelta pupusa is my favorite from here. They have so much flavor. I also get the platanos plate which has sweet, pan fried plantains, refried beans and sour cream. A very tasty combination! 

We have never dined on, it's always been take out. The service is good but tends to run 5 minutes behind what they quote. No big deal."}
{"text":"This was my 1st time eating salvadorean. I ordered a plate that had scrambled eggs, beans mixed with rice, crema and fried plantains. I'd never had those before so that was a must try for me. I loved it. I cleaned my plate with the exception of the crema. (sour cream type creama) I'm glad it covered 1/4 of my plate b/c thats calories saved - It was really good = The only reason they lost a star was b/c the waitress kept giving me ugly looks. I'm sorry I'm not fluent in spanish so I pointed to what I wanted on the menu and said' i wanted the #12 - and again she looked at me like an alien had just landed in her restaurant and i was retarded for even ordering it. I'm not sure if she was offended that I didnt speak spanish or if she thought that dish wasnt very good? Either way I didnt like it but she did that everytime she spk to me.. maybe thats just the way she looks but then my bf said that she heard a lil girl go to the counter & ask her for sweet & low/splenda and the waitress told her no we dont have that... 
Then... her mother asked for her & explained (in spanish) that it is sugar but not really - and she handed her what she asked for and told her that her daughter didnt know how to ask properly thats why she didnt know what she meant. wth!!! i'm glad I wasnt witnessing this and had been in the ladies during this episode b/c I would have just been a lil pissed off. Minus this waitress the food alone would have gotten 4 stars... I'd go back and just pray that waitress is not there..
ps. note: 
the owner seemed very nice.. as did the male host - it was his 1st day so he was bright eyed and precious looking and very polite.. unlike his co-worker."}
{"text":"We had the 3 pupusas: chicken, mixed and cheese. All 3 were yummy. Liked the chicken one best. Also got an order of the sweet empanadas. They were huge! All made fresh to order so it takes a little while,  but well worth it."}
{"text":"Was looking for something unique and off the beaten path in Vegas and came across this place while searching through yelp. I'm excited to try some Salvadorian food. Some of the reviews are right, the temp inside is not much different than the temp outside, but it is not enough of a distraction to not give it a try. 

Order the Reveltas and a couple other flavors, and it was D-liscious!!!  The tamales were very good and fresh, would've liked a little more meat, but still very tasty!!

Would come back just for the pupusas!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious but the service was lacking. We had to service ourselves half the time. I had to get up and get utensils, clean my own table, get sugar, get pepper, get togo box and seek someone to give me my bill."}
{"text":"Great authentic Salvadorean food. Great service n friendly staff. My kids love their yuca con chicharron dish with extra chicharron. Their Pupusas are large and packed with cheese. I love them. I also like placing my order of Pupusas over the phone and I pick them up on my way home from work. The food here is delicious!"}
{"text":"Love the pupusas but the customer service is not the greatest. Best thing to do is Take out; however, make sure that you check your order before you leave. I always get the wrong pupusas."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!!!!! If you're hungry DON'T come here unless you want to wait AN HOUR for your food. I was here about a month ago with Some friends, we ordered our drinks and food, drinks took 20 minutes to arrive at our table. 20 minutes tater we ask about our food and it STILL WAS NOT READY, needless to say we left. Today 6/8/15 I decided to give this place another chance, I ordered over the phone for pick up at 7:35pm. I was told 20 minutes for the food to be ready, I arrived at 8:00 pm and guess what..... THE FOOD WAS NOT READY, finally at 8:25 the bring out the food. Trust me DONT COME HERE, you've been warned. Terrible este lugar."}
{"text":"Large basic restaurant, big selection on menu, but all I got were a couple pupusas to go. They were excellent!"}
{"text":"Hands down..THE BEST PAPUSAS IN LAS VEGAS AND HENDERSON..the great thing about Las Pupusas is that no matter which location you go to around town, the food is consistent and so tasty. I get queso and chicharron con queso with extra cabbage. The pupusas are made fresh to oder so it takes some time to get your order, well worth it. The fried yuca is good, as well as the platanos con sour cream."}
{"text":"I loved the service, they took the time to explain to me what was the difference between the salvadorian horchata and the Mexican one, I really liked this one, has more of a herbal flavor than sugar. I loved the Pupusas, even though I don't know the \"original\" ones but the flavor and freshness was on point."}
{"text":"Good food haven't had anything I didn't like.
Reasonable prices good amount of food.
There always a wait but then again it's made to order and worth the wait."}
{"text":"The people's that worked here are really nice but that's where it ends. The food itself the pupusas looked sloppy. I cut into it first time I've seen oil like stuff come out of it. The hochata was super watered down could of used some more sugar. The lettuce had minimal flavor at best. The tomato sauce was really watered down too. My family is from Central America and I've eaten food from the area all my life. This was disappointing"}
{"text":"Price:
I've been to both locations. Walked in &I noticed the prices at this location are more expensive. The pupils as here were $2.25. Almost a whole dollar more each!!

Ordering:
The guy was kinda rude... I understand that he couldn't hear me well but you don't have to be rude about it. He's like \"ummm, I can't hear you\". What he said wasn't terrible but he had a big attitude from the jump.

Time:
Don't believe the waiting time that they tell you. Ordered over the phone. Guy said it would be done in 5-10min. He must have meant once I GET there cause I got there writhing 5min &I they hadn't even started them. I paid at the register & sat down. Waited another 20min until finally she started making them. They weren't even busy...literally 5 other people in here.
I've been to the other location so I know it takes a while to make the food. However don't tell someone it'll be done in a certain amount of time if it's not...the whole point of pick up is to not wait for the food lol. If that was the case I would've just ate at the restaurant.

The food:
One side of my pupusa was good &I the other half was greasy lmao. The taste okay though. Comparable to the other location."}
{"text":"Great salvadorian food pupusas are good   and not expensive .... don't expect a 5 stars restaurant but the food worth  the money"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place. I was hangry but nothing sounded good until my husband suggested pupusas. I couldn't wait to get them pupusas in my belly stat! I went with my husband and friend. Right off the bat we told the waitress we wanted separate checks and she was cool with that. 

 I ordered horchata, pupusa de frijol, pupusa de pollo con queso and a flan. My husband ordered 2 pupusas de loroco and a pupusa revuelta. 

My horchata tastes horrible. It left a weird burnt aftertaste in my mouth but they let me exchange it for another drink. Why an horchata would taste like that is beyond me. When the food came out the waitress forgot our silverware. Not a big deal. She brought them after we let her know. My pupusas were good, I liked the beans better than the chicken one. My husband got 3 loroco and no revuelta. We informed the waitress of the mistake and she seemed to have a hard time understanding the problem. The conversation went something like this: (it was in Spanish so I'm translating to English)

\"I ordered 2 loroco and one revuelta and I got all 3 loroco\"
\"What did you order?\"
\"I ordered 2 loroco and 1 revuelta\"
\"And what did you get?\"
\"I got all 3 loroco\"
\"So what is the problem, I'm not understanding\"
(At this point we all start chiming in \"it's not what he ordered, you gave him the wrong thing)
\"It's not what I ordered\"
\"So what do you want me to do\"
\"I want you to fix it\"
\"So do you want to buy another pupusa?\"
\"You know what, forget it. It's fine\"
\"It's ok I'll just get you another pupusa\"

She did not return until 30 min after we finished our meal and only because we called her over. She did not bring the pupusa and she forgot about the flan. I should mention the place was pretty empty so she was not overwhelmingly busy. We asked for the flan and our check and reminded her we wanted separate checks. So she asked us to tell her exactly what we each ordered again so we did. 

The flan I got was slightly burnt. The flan my friend got was delicious. :/ and of course my husband never got his pupusa revuelta. When she came back with the check she told me, \"I charged you for your friends flan\" umm...Ok. When it was time to sign she just stood there waiting while I calculated the tip and signed. It was so awkward having her stare at me while I did this. Needless to say I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars. This place combines Mexican and Salvadoran food. After a long flight to Las Vegas we decided to check out this spot.

The food was amazing. I ordered one chicken taco and a pupusa pollo con queso which is basically a thick corn tortilla filled with cheese and chicken.
This was my time trying Salvadoran food and I was really impressed. One taco may not sound like a lot but the pupusa itself was quite filling. It came with a side of cabbage salad (some kind of coleslaw) which had a kick to it.
My friend ordered the steak nachos and boy were they good. Not only was the steak very tasty but what I loved the most was the homemade tortilla chips. If you love spicy food, one thing to try is their homemade hot sauce.

The prices are reasonable about $2 for pupusas which is pretty cheap for the amount of food served. The service was not that great. It took an average of 20 minutes to get our waters refilled. Another thing, that bothered me was a $2 \"miscellaneous\" charge added to our check. We didn't notice it until we left the restaurant, so please check your receipt before leaving.

The food at this restaurant is good despite the 2 negatives things that I mentioned. I would probably go back whenever I return to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I was there today for my typical platanos con frijol y crema! I was truly disappointed I come here for lunch often & I take my meal to-go. Well today I sat down to eat my dish at work and I saw what seemed to be a facial hair in my crema! It grossed me out I was halfway through my meal and honestly I dont plan to go here ever again. Not sure what sanitary precautions they take but it doesnt seem like they take any. Facial Hair?? Ewww gross!"}
{"text":"Having stopped by the bank next door, my girlfriend Yelped this place.  

I am SO glad she did!

We were only in town 3 mornings and we ate here EVERY morning. The pupusas were amazing. Neither of us had ever had them before but we are both big fans of them now.  If you've never had them, try them, they are like pockets of deliciousness!"}
{"text":"for about ten years this place has been my family favorite restaurant, every time they change something is for the better, love the food!, you can find the most of the Salvadorian plates! .....try the corn milk in winter time is so delicious! ...I love the new look inside the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Very good food! I eat there a few times a month and have never had a bad meal or experience! The staff is great also and very helpful."}
{"text":"Es muy buena comida y barata a comparaci√≥n de los bufetts deshabridos y sin sabor, con 10 d√≥lares te hartas bien"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some take out. Super nice people. The food was good and they were very super in helping me decide what to order. Very basic place, no guacamole and you don't get extra condiments like lime wedge or salsa with your tacos. But the meats were well cooked and tacos tasted like what I got in Mexico. DH had a veggie burrito. It's not on the menu, but they accommodated my request. Place was pretty busy for a sunday afternoon. Lots of locals and natives which is always a good sign."}
{"text":"Pupusas are always good here, I can't complain about that. We always pay around $13 for 5 pupusas and 2 sodas. Can't beat the price. The tv is always set to soccer which I don't mind because l don't go out to watch television. A lot of their customers are always watching it and cheering on so its nice that they show sports. The waitresses are another story. They're pretty emotionless and seem uninterested in what you want. Every time I come with my boyfriend they hardly pay any attention to me and usually only ask him the questions. It's quite odd. It's actually rude. Thankfully I don't care too much about their service to stop coming here."}
{"text":"When we walked in the door it was not what we expected. We were expecting restaurant style seating but it's more of a fast food little hole in the wall joint. I am as a say those hole in the wall joints are absolutely fabulous. Authentic Salvadori and food with a lot of flavor and generous portions.  Give them a try."}
{"text":"First time eating Pupusas and let me say, this restaurant did not disappoint. We ordered the nachos, homemade chips were amazing! The Pupusas were so flavorful and the service was spot on! I'd recommend the mixed Pupusas with the house made sauce, not spicy, but so flavorful..."}
{"text":"I had to knock off a star...now that I'm more familiar with salvadorian food, this place does not cut it anymore."}
{"text":"if i could give this place -5 stars, i would. i'll make this as simple as possible.
1. the cashier couldn't properly take down my order
2. the cashier wasn't sure what a CHEESE ENCHILADA was, so instead, he punched me in for a medium drink
3. i even placed my order in both english AND spanish, and he still didn't understand me
4. he wasn't sure of the menu items at all, had to keep asking the cooks if this/that was able to be made.... which was yes at the register but 10 mins into waiting for my food, i was told couldn't come that way.. 
5. i almost forgot to mention, he forgot to give me my change until i put my hand out and even then i don't think he gave me the correct amount of change
6. the pupusas were dry and greasy, the meat wasn't seasoned at all
7. tomato juice and cabbage came in ZIP LOCK bags!! what am i suppose to do with the tomato juice?! pour it into a different container? poke a hole and squeeze it out?! dip my pupusa in the bag?! disgusting and inconvenient!
8. i still don't know what their cheese enchilada taste like because I NEVER GOT ONE!

i'm not coming back here, don't waste your time. they clearly don't know what they're doing or how to speak english nor spanish."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. Delicious papusas for so cheap. We eat here on the reg. Very friendly staff and great food. Don't waste your time on the appetizers though - they are mediocre at best."}
{"text":"This is authentic El Salvadorian food don't let appearances fool you. Their pupusas are amazing and definitely worth the short drive off the strip."}
{"text":"I have never had Salvadoran food, but this is really good! I had a to try a little of everything. I must say I was not disappointed!"}
{"text":"good pupusas!!!!!! 1st time trying pupusas and i am a fan! its nice to kno there are still types of food out there i havnt discovered yet!!!!!!!!

if you are reading this review and havnt tried pupusas go get it!!!

its like a round thick corn tortilla (the ones they use for south american food) stuffed with cheese and shredded pork. you eat it with an orange sauce and hot sauce if you like...

you are supposed to eat it with pickled cabbage, but i preffer not to. i like to taste the full effect of cheese and shredded pork and hot sauce!

good shit! LOL"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place one more time. No one to greet us except for a strong fishy smell. We had the chicken, cheese and bean pupusas. The food was ok, but nothing special. Our server did not come by and offer to refill drinks. Overall cleanliness was okay. We were not impressed, so we won't return here for awhile."}
{"text":"Just finished trying this place and I do have to say it's not too bad at all! It could've used more spice and maybe salt, I know salt is provided and all but still.

My girlfriend and I ordered the cheese and chicken pupusas. First off they make it fresh so it's not like it sits on the side or in a pan. They have a lady there that makes them and you can tell it's with love. They serve you a bowl of cabbage (seasoned) and a bottle of homemade tomato sauce, not too bad. There is a slight wait but it's due to the fresh pupusas being made. 

When you receive the pupusas, they come out nice and warm and it's good! I would recommend this place to anyone craving pupusas and I will be back to try the other Salvadorian food I saw on the menu! 

Oh and he horchata isn't your normal horchata it's a Salvadorian horchata!"}
{"text":"Bad service.  My food was sitting wrapped up on a counter for five minutes while I stood there watching it being ignored.  I won't go back.  The food was just ok, pretty greasy."}
{"text":"Tried a pupusa here for my first time and was pleasantly surprised at just how much I liked them! I had the chicken pupusa and a bean pupusa and I loved how they are served with the refreshing pickled coleslaw and red sauce. The flavors paired together so well and I can't believe I had never tried one before. We also tried the corn tamale which had delicious shredded beef inside but the outer consistency was just a bit soggy for me, unfortunately. I still give this restaurant 5 stars for delicious pupusas and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Salvadorian Food I've had yet! Reasonably priced and good service. The orders got messed up but they still quickly corrected it so there's no reason to rate less than 5."}
{"text":"I've only ever had the papusas, but considering the name of the restaurant I'm not sure why I'd bother to order anything else. The bean and cheese ate my favorite. Each papusa is made to order so prepare to wait 15-20 min for your meal. The customer service isn't particularly friendly but the restaurant is clean and the food fresh."}
{"text":"Saw this place when I was going to the outlet mall. The Pupusas are wonderful. I had the mixed and cheese and was not disappointed!  Both were great. I will definitely be visiting this place for lunch or dinner again before I return home."}
{"text":"Hands down still my favorite place to come for pupusas in town. This location has recently remodeled inside and it gives it a nice friendly face lift. 

The pupusas are always so hot and fresh and always cooked perfectly. Not oily, or too much masa and not enough filling. The curtido here is always crunchy and delicious. Never too salty or vinegary. 

I also love the variety of fillings they have at this location for pupusas. Chicharrones and cheese is one my favorites but the calabasas and cheese is definitely in my rotation now. 

I recently had the yucca and fried chicharrone and while it was not as delicious as my pupusas, it was good. The fried pork was definitely fried as it was super crispy and once I added some salt and tomato sauce it was good eats. The yucca was perfect. Soft and creamy on the inside and a nice bite on the outside.

Helpful Hint: Call your order in ahead of time if you don't want to wait long for your food.  Also know that they charge $1.00 to use your debit."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times before but today they were extremely rude. After checking my receipt I noticed they charged me for an extra item, i asked them to credit as it was incorrect. The waitress was extremely rude stating there was no way to get refunded (even though I hadn't received my food) and REFUSED to refund the trans. She should not shift the blame on the customer, rather avoid any confusion by repeating the order. I love going to all locations but this recent visit will probably be my last. I have never had such rude waitress. Keep in mind that not everyone that comes in to your location is a tourist. I am a local from the SW and I will make sure to inform everyone to avoid this location"}
{"text":"Awesome place!!! They have wonderful pupusas. I always like to try Salvadorian restaurants everywhere I go and by far this is the best I've had here in Vegas! The staff is so friendly and helpful when ordering. The prices are great too! Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"We asked for refills for our sodas and 15 minutes and no refills, I had to walk to the front and bring the cups. That wasn't too much a problem since the food tasty food but afterwards we all had to run to the restroom because of the runs and me throat was hurting."}
{"text":"I usually like my pupusas thinner yet still this place is a true winner.  

I took a friend to this place for as a farewell lunch prior to his retirement and we usually make habit of trying out new cuisine.  This one was a great success.  The pupusas were very tasty as was the onion steak and the tamales.  The tamales had a texture that was different then the Mexican tamales I've had but different in a good way because it enhanced the flavor."}
