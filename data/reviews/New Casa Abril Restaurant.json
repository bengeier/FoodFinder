{"text":"Everything was VERY SALTY and pre frozen. The mushrooms were canned, steak was pre frozen, salad had watered down dressing that was sitting for probably an hour, appies was frozen and the service was horrible. Embarrassing to Portuguese cuisine. Strongly recommend to look elsewhere. Not even worth 1 star!!"}
{"text":"Missing floor boards missing lights out of date location food is bland and terrible . Rude staff rude waiters 
Terrible location in the middle of the ghetto 
I would never recommend this place to  anyone that has eyes and a tongue"}
{"text":"Great food and service, would highly recommend for people wanting to try an authentic Portuguese restaurant. Olives, bread and fresh Portuguese cheese are served to you while you wait to make your order. Food is delicious, great cod fish dishes and steak. Nice atmosphere and friendly servers."}
{"text":"Lots of parking, great food, reasonably fast service, great wines, friendly staff and live music on Saturdays. Recommend, don't stress and get a parking ticket elsewhere"}
{"text":"Great place to eat on a weeknight but fantastic on a Friday to Sunday. There is a resident musician who ads to the ambiance. If you want a great romantic getaway on a weeknight or a weekend this is your place. I will be back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the main place my hubbies family has their occassions.  The place is trying to look upscale, but falls slightly short and looks more like an overdressed cafeteria with nice dishes in display cases and visible wine racks.  The food, however, is incredible, with portion sizes that usually mean I'm bringing a lot home for later.  Whenever we go here, we have the same thing.  Shrimp soup to start and the Filet Mignon for entree and a bottle of wine. Of course, you get your complimentary bread/olives/cheese basket while waiting.  For 2 of us, the bill is usually $125, before tip, so this is an occassion-only type of place, but we LOVE it.  Sometimes, the steak doesn't have bacon and sometimes they do substitutions without telling you.  We don't mind.  They have entertainers on weekends.  They give you that karaoke feel, but it fits their quaint other-worldly feel.  They have an upstairs and downstairs for private parties and the main dining area is on the main floor.  Kids are welcome.
