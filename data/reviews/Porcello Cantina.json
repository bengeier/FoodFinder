{"text":"Great atmosphere and extremely friendly staff.  Pasta was top notch and flavourful. Bar tender was able to make an amazing old fashion."}
{"text":"I had the absolute best salad I've ever eaten in my lifetime (and I eat a lot of salads) ...try the \"Spinach & Barley\" with chicken! Phenomenal! I've lost count on the number of times I've eaten here, Always delicious & freshly cooked! If you love a casual atmosphere where the staff are friendly then this is the place to go!! I may be going back daily for the spinach salad. :)"}
{"text":"Great porchetta, fantastic desert and amazing staff! Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"So so good! I've been here about 5 times in the past month. Their pizza slices are super fresh and gourmet for the same price as a slice from a run of the mill pizza chain. Had the gnocchi last time and it was really light for something made of potato. Melts in your mouth. Great choice of sauces too. My boyfriend and I love the porchetta sandwiches too. We had the sandwich with all the extra toppings at our first visit and looooooved it. Which is a big deal for me because I don't really care for pork. But that sandwich won me over! Had a Nutella filled bombe my last visit and damn near lost my mind. They fill it on the spot. This place is gonna ruin my waist line lol! I always get the same girl at cash. I think her name is Angelica. Very sweet and give us great recommendations when we go. I think the cook in the back is one on the owners. Super nice guy. You can tell he really cares about getting the product right. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this little gem. The atmosphere is casual and fun. The service was outstanding. The bar manager made me a drink and all I told him was vodka and not sweet. It was a twist on a cosmo and was super good! I had the fettuccine with mushroom and truffle oil....it was outstanding. The pasta was cooked to perfection. I will be back next week and already have my heart set on the pizza (it looked great) and a salad."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved this place. I never write reviews but definitely get the calamari fritti. It is exceptional! Our service was fantastic as well. We visited Ontario from Arizona and really enjoyed the food and wine here! A++"}
{"text":"I visited Porcello Cantina for my sister's birthday recently, we were a party of 7, and there were 2 other large parties there, as well as a table of 4 at the same time. We ordered the daily arancini (mushroom), which were amazing, as well as lamb spiducci and grilled calamari, which were also well-liked, to start. I shared the pizza with proscuitto & burrata, and had the fettucine with wild mushroom sauce. The pizza was delicious, but the pasta was phenomenal. I really loved the sauce. 2 guests enjoyed the Meat of the day (Short Ribs...the were HUGE), 2 enjoyed the rigatoni dish, and 2 enjoyed the pappardelle with wild boar ragu. Everyone was super happy with their meals.   The only \"complaint\" we could have had would be that the food took a bit long to arrive at our table, but our server repeatedly apologized for the delay and explained that they were very short staffed in the kitchen that evening. At the end of the meal, the chef (I think?) came out to talk to us about the meal and thank us for our patience, which I think was a really nice gesture, and the server also comped one of the drinks, which again, was a really nice thing of her to do.  TL,DR: This place is great, and I can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"Service is very slow. The waiter is slow and so is the kitchen. The menu is tiny, there are not many options to choose from. The food is decent."}
{"text":"Food: 3.5/5  Service: 4.5/5  I ordered a mushroom pizza, it was quite filling. The crust was cooked to perfection. Cheesy and flavourful. However, I wish they had more varieties of mushrooms. My coworker enjoyed his venison ragu. Good service and atmosphere. There was nothing major to complain about."}
{"text":"My friend and I went for dinner, after working out in the gym next door.  The server is super friendly and made us feel at home.  The house wine is good and good value too.  We had the papparadelle with wild boar and the casarecce with sausage.  Both delicious!  We would definitely return."}
{"text":"Porcello Cantina has changed from its initial counter-style casual, to casual sit-down restaurant - and I think it's for the better.   Overall, it's still really solid. The best thing about this place is that they are trying to do their own, modern thing in Woodbridge. It's not a family style Italian restaurant, it's not some generic chain place. It's a place in an otherwise non-descript parking lot where you can come get a drink and some decent food in a nicely decorated, welcoming restaurant. It brings some much needed style to the food scene in Woodbridge which, save for exceptions like Ciao Roma, is staid and boring. While we were there, some older gentleman came in and had an espresso at the bar, another family came in and got a takeout salad, while we had cocktails and pizza. It's that kind of place.   I still think the food could be slightly better. It's not bad at all! I just wish it were amazing rather than merely good. But that's nitpicking because I want this place to survive and thrive. Woodbridge is better for having it around."}
{"text":"Great porchetta, pizza, pasta and staff! Oh, and the lighting fixtures are out of this world."}
{"text":"I was so excited when this place opened! Finally got the chance to try it today for lunch. Walking in, the restaurant looked very clean and I loved the wooden vibe. There was about 3 other tables sitting down and we were advised to take a seat by the hostess. It took awhile for someone to come, but I just figured it was cause there was only one server and one hostess I guess? We ordered the burrata to start which was tasty and definitely fresh. Next we both ordered the original porchetta sandwich. When it came it looked amazing! Although, I was surprised the meat was cut into cubes, every other porchetta sandwiches I've had, the meat was shredded, but it wasn't really an issue until I took my first bite, this is where I noticed that majority of the meat was just cubes of fat, and it kinda turned me off to be honest. At this point, we also just received our drinks! Our server was very nice but clearly having difficulty working basically alone during lunch service. Everything was just okay, might come back and try something else off the menu."}
{"text":"I like this place. Cosy ambience, well lit (not too bright). I can bring my wife on a date or family. They have a decent collection of wine (they can improve for sure but I like the inclusion of not just Italian regulars but good Niagara selection, they can improve for sure). The food is excellent- we had truffle fries, the huge meat ball, gnochi, parpadelle with ragu, and finished off with a dessert. Most importantly- the staff and host are awesome! Make u feel very comfortable which is very important to me for a complete dining experience. We are actually going back tonight."}
{"text":"This is the most amazing resto! The food is out of this world!! The pizza, the gnocchi and can I mention the dessert??!! Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I love my lunch experience at Porcello Cantina!  The set up is casual but with some table service if you do decide to eat in. You ordered the food at the counter and your food would be served to your table. You paid when you ready to leave.   I love the rustic decor of the interior. There are also a small section at the side where you can pick up some Italian grocery: pasta, sauce, cheese and more.  We shared:  Porchetta Sandwich uses Berkshire Pig from Western Ontario ($8.50) Fresh Cavatelli with Pancetta ($15) House Red Wine ($5) and Caffe Latte ($4) Nutella Bomboloni ($4)  Everything tasted so fresh, delicious and perfectly prepared. This is one of those places I would opt for a glass of wine instead of a latte?   Since most of the items are made to order, so if you are in a rush during lunch, sandwich and pizza slices with a salad might be a better option.  Staff is friendly and checked on us frequently during our meal. Our waitress was really cheerful and has great personality!!  Highly recommend Porcello Cantina if you are looking for a casual and authentic Italian experience!"}
{"text":"Been here twice with my office and am still loving it. Great food, beautiful decor, ample seating, and wonderful staff. I adore the massive parmigiano-reggiano on the front counter and the golden porchetta sitting behind a glass display on a chopping block. Besides their pizza and sandwiches, I also tried their gnocchi which was delicious!"}
