{"text":"Jillian's offered great football viewing for those of us with allegiances to teams outside the Midwest.  good bar entertainment options, not so great food...or service...or beer/wine selection.    but none of this matters much, as they have CLOSED due to the emergence of downtown Champaign as the nightspot of choice (to paraphrase the News-Gazette article that announced the closure)."}
{"text":"This place has killer nachos, and usually pretty good servers.  Lots of eye candy abounds.  My usual place to watch sports.  Former Coke bottling plant building in town, tastefully redone."}
{"text":"This was one of the best concert venues in Las Vegas. I miss Jillian's. Just like someone else said. Its kinda like Dave and Busters. Hope something else opens up just like Jillians."}
{"text":"Three large rooms, one has pool tables, the other video games, and the last is a nice upscale bar with a private banquet room off to the side.  I would never, ever even think of going to a place like this.  But for a Yelp event, I'll make exceptions.  It seems like a fun playground for twenty somethings or corporate events.  It offers a lot of ways for people to break the ice.  I have to admit I was eyeballing the air hockey table and some of the shooter games but I wasn't there long and didn't get to take the plunge.  I'm sure it gets slammed on Friday and Saturday nights which is great for them.  But small details inevitably fall by the wayside at places like this.  Elbows stick to the bar countertop, shoes stick to the floor, the food is Applebee's-meets-Dairy Queen...  Of course they serve booze which is 90% of the point of it all here.     But hey, it's a unique kind of ambience for the patrons who love it.  The servers were very helpful and attentive during our visit.  So all three stars are for them."}
{"text":"Jillian's is pretty much the only place in the hunk of junk known as Neonopolis to ever have anyone in it, and it's easy to see why.  Its appeal is pretty universal.  It's a restaurant, giant arcade, bowling alley, bar, music venue and dance club all rolled in to one - however, everything in one place doesn't always mean it's awesome.  I've had some good times at Jillian's, but if I'm hanging out downtown it's not my top choice of places to go.  I ate here once with my ex-husband, and although he left the bad taste in my mouth, the food was pretty good.  It's your typical, American, Apostrophe S restaurant cuisine.  The arcade is fun, but it's no measure to Dave and Buster's (why don't we have one of THOSE?  jeez!).  The bowling is fun, that's for sure.  It's a little more expensive than other alternatives like Sam's Town or the Gold Coast, but they have groovy balls and blacklit lanes all the time and I'm a nerd for things like that.  Also, my friend Ryan fell asleep on one of the bowling benches and they let him sleep there.  (I guess that's a plus if it's a tired friend, not so much if it's one of the transient population of downtown.)  The bar is a bit pricey and doesn't have much in the way of pizazz and the DJ and dance floor are notoriously lame.  Lots of local bands and some touring acts play here from time to time.  I've never gone to one of those shows and, frankly, I'm kinda baffled as to where they set them up.  One of my ex-boyfriends once tried to get frisky in one of the banquet rooms.  I'm not that kind of a girl and it smelled like salad dressing, so I passed.  But if that's your bag, there's always that possibility."}
{"text":"A place to drink, eat, and play that virtual motorcycle game with three of your closest friends, plus tons of billiard tables.  Just a little north of campus.  It's a large place, so it's a good destination for drinks after work, or other large gatherings - they do events as well.  The sandwiches and burgers are very heavy and caloric.  Beer and wine selection are not huge."}
{"text":"I participated on a panel at the Amplify Music Festival, and this is where it took place.  Jillian's is recognizable as a variety of the \"Dave and Buster's\" genre- video games with booze, you know?    I'm not an afficianado of he genre- skee ball is for kids, aight?  But I did spend an enjoyable Vegas afternoon here on their indoor bowling alley.  They manufactured a decent white russian; while the pizza and nachos we ordered were TERRIBLE!!!  They also have a live music venue downstairs- that is probably what sets Jillian's apart from other Dave and Buster's type places.  I didn't actually go to a show there, so I can't review that aspect.  The video games looked like a tossed off after thought- nothing that looked interesting- except for the white water rafting game(?!?) that looked interesting  The decor is reminscent of your standard TGIF."}
{"text":"I must say I have to agree with EVERYTHING Janelle said. I actually went to Jillians for a social event put on by Bank of America as part of the intervewing process. It was definitely a chill time. I spent my time beating people in ping pong, air hockey, and pool. The appetizers were amazing...like they were really good.....we had buffalo chicken tenders, some bomb seasoned fries, pizza, and burgers. Everything was really tasty..I even took some back to my hotel in a doggy bag. The waiters were very attentive and were always willing to get us whatever drinks we needed. It was good times....I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"If you're looking for something different to do, I'd hit up Jillian's one night. This arcade for grownups has tons of billiards and video games. My boyfriend and I stopped there one Friday night to play some Ski Ball. It was fun, but then the cigarette smoke started to choke us and we left. It seems like a good place to hold large events because there's plenty of space and plenty of things for people to do there."}
{"text":"Jillian's is a lot of fun. It sometimes feels a little like a college bar, but otherwise, it's a safe bet for a good time. There's lots of different stuff to do, from pool to that air hockey game that men seem to love to the inevitable Charlottean pingpong table. It's hard to get bored, even if you don't drink!  The food is also pretty good. It's standard bar fare (Nachos, burgers, fries, etc.), but it's done well. The place is huge, so it's often the first place people think of for special events. If you're ever trying to get a big group together, and if you'd like to stay in one place instead of barhopping, Jillian's is a great option."}
{"text":"This is a great time for people of all ages, there are a ton of games, beer, and quality appetizers.  I can spend hours killing time here and enjoying myself.  They have a lot of great first person shooter arcade games that you can just keep playing and playing with the swipe of a card.    I always see a lot of business parties being held here, and I think that it is a nice choice.  Too many business outings are held in quiet fancy restaurants and it just gets boring sitting around talking about work over wine.  I would much rather come here and shoot some hoops with my co-workers.  The only downside is the dent that it puts in your wallet, there is a lot of entertainment and it is easy to get carried away."}
{"text":"oh! what to do in a city where there's so MUCH to do? where do most of the locals in Vegas hang out?  Skee Ball and hot dudes offering to teach you how to handle a ball. Pool tables for you to reach over ever so sexily to hit that cue.   i love Jillian's in Seattle. my local buddies and my crew from LA attending someone's birthday party. this location is pretty average. the scene is pretty laid back- but the local men here are completely prowling for fresh meat. you can almost feel the desperation."}
{"text":"I can't believe it's really over. I was reluctant to believe Phillip C. but when I saw it with my own 2 eyes it nearly brought me to tears. Other than the 99 cent deep fried twinkies & oreos at Mermaids there really was no other reason to go downtown except Jillian's-IT will be missed. Especially the concerts."}
{"text":"Not much has changed since the last time I was at Jillian's.  It's still huge.  As I mentioned to E.F. during the first unofficial Charlotte Yelp gathering, I seem to recall that the small section next to the dining area had hibachi grills (like you'll see at Kabuto's).  Does anyone else remember that?  Not a big deal - just want to think I'm not going completely insane.  As to Jillian's itself, there isn't much to say that hasn't already been said: It's big.  It's good for events.  When we were there, a fight was getting ready to happen.  Not a fight like you might find at your lower-class places between patrons, but on the big-screens, of which there are probably 16.  Unfortunately, they are the older projection type that are perennially out-of-focus or losing brightness.  Though it would cost, they should invest in some LCD or Plasma screens.  It would really help.  Other than that, you'll find a small cozy area (where I recall the hibachi grills were), a larger open area for eating, adjacent to the bar, another area behind that for pool and ping-pong, which can get somewhat smoky, an \"arcade for adults\", which isn't that much different from an arcade for kids except you have to go through the smoke and there is a bar in the middle and some small televisions around, and then a cigar bar in back (I don't smoke, so I can't speak to that, but you can smell it if you're nearby).  What I don't really get is that if this is an \"arcade for adults\", why do they have tickets that you get at the games so you can get stupid little stuffed animals like at Chuck E. Cheese's, and only then after waiting for a while for a staff member to show?  Yes, you can get your game fix by pre-loading credits onto cards, rather than tokens, but beware - those credits expire, so use 'em or lose 'em.  The other part that stinks about it is that (apparently) private parties can book certain areas - the dining section or the pool/ping-pong, for example - meaning if you go, expecting to be able to use them, they can be completely closed off to the public, which makes it good for the group, but bad for the public.  Nice access to the light rail again makes it good for the public, but potentially shuttering areas of the place means you could be hit with a bad surprise.  Just be ready.  I know this is getting long, but about the food: It is pretty standard bar fare.  Nothing outstanding here, but it's not bad either, and let's face it - you aren't really going for the food, are you?"}
{"text":"I do like the variety in live music every weekend and the beer buffet, good memories. But overall there are better ways to have fun off the Strip. Saw Arch Enemy and Machine Head here last September....someone really screwed up in booking the venue because the downstairs \"ballroom\" definitely isn't built for metal. The sound was so bad, openers Throwdown had to cut out after 4 songs so they could fix the \"staticky\" PA in time for the headliners. That definitely soured things for me, as it was my first time seeing Machine Head live and I was impressed at their professionalism at delivering the goods, even with the substandard accomodations. Reggae and local punk is great here...but steer clear if the bill involves downtuning and a lot of double bass. I was cursing a lot that night. And I was neither drunk. Nor a sailor."}
{"text":"Jillian's is where your office goes to have a big event on the cheap w/ alcohol, some fun and some games (e.g. pool, expensive video games, air hockey).   Atmosphere - Warehouse-ish, dark, woody, open, big, Concord Mill-ish, dated.  Did I say big yet?   Service - Friendly, confused, helpful.  The staff here is very friendly and helpful (gave me a tip on coming in early to watch the fight on the cheap).  They are confused, as two told me the pool table area was open while three told me it was reserved.  I guess it was open reserved?  This kind of stunk, as pool was the reason we went here.  Food - Like Chad said, \"you aren't really going for the food, are you?\"  This place is all about appetizers and booze, but appetizers do not make a meal.  So I chose the booze.  The mixed drink @ $5.75 was not bad, star added!!    Overall - Jillian's is best if your company invites you, you are with a group of 10 + or if there is some special sporting event being televised.  Other than that, this is not the best game in town."}
{"text":"We went to Jillian's on the night of the BCS National Championship with a group of 12 people. I was shocked to see how empty the place was.   They allow you to reserve different portions of the restaurant. We reserved the shuffle board, ping pong and pool tables (Billiard's East). The group enjoyed it and our server was quick with getting the orders.  The disappointing thing was we had to go looking for the pool balls and the wax for the shuffleboard table. We made the reservation so everything would be setup for us so that was kind of disappointing.  I was surprised to see so many of the video games where out of order.   I'd use Jillian's again but I wonder how long the place is going to last if they do not get bigger crowds or keeping the games working."}
{"text":"Closed! Finally!  Bad beer, always slow and old games. Let's hope something good goes in."}
{"text":"Oh Jillians...  what an experience.  As we were winding down from our big day on the strip we decided to check out Fremont Street....wow....what a change in pace ad scenery.   Jillian's is similar to (but not as cool as) a Dave & Busters.  We bowled under a black light and drank cocktails which was pretty cool."}
{"text":"Very nice and relaxed off campus bar. They have a huge room with pool tables, darts and of course very big TV's. If you can't make it to a football game or want to watch the Illini basketball team win this is the place to go. The food is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Low-key place that's good for drinks or a meal. Half the place is taken up with pool tables, and there is a pretty expansive arcade room with at least 10 different games, as well as TV's everywhere. 1/3 of the building has the bar and restaurant seating - the seating is a 50 foot row of huge booths (good for 8-10 people) across from the equally long bar. Both the booths and bar are deep mahogany, the ceiling is black, and there are only very dim lights over each booth, so it's a rather dark, relaxing atmosphere. Bartender and servers are late-20s age and very charming. None of that rushed, overzealous high school service.  My partner and I have gone twice at odd times - 1:45 and 3:30pm - so I think we saw the lunch menu both times, which was basic bar food with a couple extra options. Burgers, chicken and fried fish sandwiches, salads, and some appetizers - all ranging $6-8. However, they do have excellent Chicago style hotdogs, which is actually a (weekly?) lunch special. Also have a white pizza with olive oil, mozzarella, fresh garlic and fresh roma tomatoes that's pretty decent - a soft flavor that accentuates the tomatoes more than anything (personally, I love a strong garlic taste, but this was OK). It's even better with grilled chicken, which, by the way, is not some 1/4 inch thick, pinky-long piece of meat. My grilled chicken sandwich was a good couple inches wide and had no trouble covering their generous-sized buns. That goes for all dishes, actually. Huge portions. The turkey club is a 4-inch stack of turkey, bacon and toast with 4 handfuls of fries; carrot cake is a 4-layer, 1/5 of the cake slab of moist cake layered with cream cheese icing and perfectly roasted pecans, carrots, and coconut (good for 4 people). The white chicken chili is another \"extra\" offering that is not spicy, but chocked full of beans, chicken and tomatoes served with sour cream and shredded cheese. The beans were almost crunchy, which signaled they were not cooked long enough, but the soup was still unique and served as a good meal starter.  Basically, relaxed and charming atmosphere with lots of entertainment options for college students, or perfect ambiance for quiet conversation and an American meal. Tons of food for the money. The parking lot is riddled with deep pot holes, though, and the place itself is tricky to enter from Neil St the first time you try to find it."}
