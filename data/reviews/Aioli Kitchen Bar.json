{"text":"Ate there last night, Service was great! 

The food... well my small plate was the size of my main, I wish I had to have been told that earlier....It was good all the same. 

My boyfriend liked his meal (Lamb) the side was so so so good. I had lobster gnocchi, and it was Ok at best. 

Only because of the proximity to my house and the service we visit again."}
{"text":"I romantic summers evening, thinking hey lets try Aioli for dessert and coffee....big mistake. Firstly the place was empty...number one clue, so we decided to take a seat on their patio. We ordered two Monte Cristo's and the Italian cheesecake. The waitress stated that it would take several minutes to brew a pot of coffee for our Monte Cristo's. Wait a minute we're in an a Mediterranean restaurant and you're not making a  pressed coffee, ok, I can get past this, lets hope the brewed stuff is good. Several minutes later two speciality coffees are served and they are hugely watered down and COLD. Let's hope the dessert wow's us.  Sprinkled graham wafer crumbs on a plate with globs of whipped cream cheese and some orange filling from a can.  And the reason I knew it was from a can, was the clear distinct taste of metal. Wow what a huge disappointment to what was suppose to be the end of a romantic night. This place won't last and we definitely will not be returning. If I could of  given a zero rating that is what I would have give this place."}
{"text":"This is a newer edition to Calgary's NW foodie scene and I feel like it is a bastion of greatness amongst the many average restaurants that exist in this part of the city.  

Aioli is a fusion of Western European comfort foods: Italian, Greek, Portuguese, French, and Spanish. The owner has spent quite a bit of time travelling throughout Europe looking for ideas and experiences to bring back to his restaurant (and is more than happy to chat about his travels). 

I have never once ever had a bad experience here... and the food is always fantastic. Do yourself a favour and bypass the Chiantis down the street and head over to Aioli for a change."}
{"text":"Most unfortunately, this restaurant appears closed permanently ... at least I got to bring my wife here before then, and she agreed: The food was excellent. Sorry to see you go, Aioli."}
{"text":"Aioli Kitchen is in the old location of Broken Plate. I sure liked broken plate so I had high expectations since the food and service was good there.

Started off with some wine and reviewed the menu. A good variety of items.

To start we had the beef carpaccio.  I wouldnt say it was the best I had but it was tasty and no complaints. For dinner we  had the lobster gnocchi and chicken flat bread. Both were great since we shared.  I sure wished there was more of the the lobster gnocchi since the portion was quiet small. 

The service was good and so was the food/bevies. A bit pricey but the atmosphere was nice and people were friendly."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a lovely dinner at Aioli this past Saturday. We were in the neighborhood and thought we would check it out based on the good things we have heard instead of driving downtown as we often would. 

We found Aioli welcoming with warm and friendly service. It was a hot evening so we ordered a red wine sangria right away and it was easily one of the best sangrias I've ever had. I am a bit of a sangria snob since I lived in Spain for a while and when done right it is a wonderful summer drink. I highly recommend Aioli sangria, so good! 

For dinner we shared the lobster gnocchi and the ribs and both were great - flavorful and delicious. Lots of fresh lobster in the gnocchi to my delight! 

My husband holds dessert near and dear to his heart so we always order one and share it. We tried the Portuguese pudding and it was also pretty awesome as well as on a lighter side which I loved. 

We both felt that for the quality of food and our hand crafted drinks the price point was very friendly. Much more so than places we go to downtown where a bottle of wine often costs what our entire bill did for this dinner. We really liked Aioli with its Mediterranean inspired food/drinks and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's got the vibe and tapas to match similar places on 17th ave which is nice to find in the NW. The community table is a really great idea. Had the gluten free Camembert, piri piri chicken, potatas bravas and mixed vegetables. Very good flavors and spices. Everything was cooked spot on. I also really like how the menu samples many favorites from top European countries. Neat idea! Great service and wine selection make this a new local fave."}
{"text":"This was the second time we have been here. Got to say I had high hopes for aioli, but alas it was just average. Nothing was terrible, but nothing outstanding either. Mussels were a disappointment, as at least 3 of the shells were broken and I ended up with chunks of shell in my mouth. The pork belly and beans was fine, but a little bland. Would be nice to have a bit more unique selections for appetizers and sharing plates. Calamari wasn't very good. And I really think calamari has run its course. Does every place need to have calamari ? No imagination.  
Not to many places in the NW to go, and im on the fence if to come back. The atmosphere is good, but the food and menu needs some work if there is any hope of keeping people from traveling to the core for much better offerings."}
{"text":"Calgary's deeper NW has a serious lack of finer end dining and for that reason I really wanted to like Aioli when we saw it replaced Broken Plate.   Unfortunately,   Aioli isn't a strong contended compared to like establishments closer to the core.

On the positive side:

Wonderful cocktails
Great service

On the forgettable side:

Everything else. 

For food,  I ordered Risotto and market veggies.  Hubs ordered Pork Belly.  Chocolate cake for dessert. 

The risotto was the biggest miss of the night.  It was pretty enough (although the room is dark and you don't get the full effect of the nice plating) but the food was flat, boring and confused.   It came out smelling strongly of mushrooms/truffle and set the expectation for a strong umami dish with the rich creamy texture a risotto should have but the dish was neither.  The dish was too lite and had an overwhelming lemon flavor.   The fat of the cheese should have cut the acid and I'd almost say it was missing cheese completely but I could see strings of cheese so it did make a cameo.   I asked for salt (a first of mine in finer dining) to make it edible and even then it wasn't great.   I can't imagine anyone tasted that before it left the kitchen because it was basically an expensive gruel.  

The market vegetables were OK but honestly could have been a side dish at a midrange Chinese food joint.  I generally LOVE market vegetable dishes from great chiefs and I cried a little bit on the inside to think they served that for $8.   

The pork belly was good but overdone in parts and probably the best of the dishes technically but yet still just not bad.  

The truffle chocolate cake was what got me sold on Aoili for dinner tonight in the first place and yet I finished my entree and suggested we skip dessert or get froyo.  Hubs convinced me to let Aoili try to redeem themselves with chocolate so we did order dessert.  Unfortunately the cake followed the trend of the evening.  It looked wonderful and I even liked the components separately but together I wasn't impressed.  The \"cake\" was more like a thin chocolate truffle square (yummy although I wouldn't describe it as cake) covered in a lemon foam (which in itself was wonderful but there was far too much and really worked against the rich chocolate).  There was a large heap of berry compote which was a bit tart for the dish and I just left it.   Probably my favorite thing next to the cocktails but it was still a little underwhelming.  

Ultimately Aoili was a miss and there are so many other things I would have rather done with the $100 it cost the two of us."}
{"text":"Took my wife out for a nice Saturday night dinner and we decided on Aioli. I'm glad we went. The food was fantastic. The manager sold me on the rib-eye. Now I'm not usually much for rib-eyes, however, this one was done souve and it was delicious. My wife had the wild mushroom rissoto and we had started out with the baked camembert. Both were excellent! To finish the night off, we had the peach crumble and it was a nice cap to the evening. Great selection of import beer & wines. The NW is starving for places that serve great food and this place fits in nicely!"}
{"text":"Aioli Kitchen & Bar is a new Mediterranean restaurant in Ranchlands .  The restaurant is recently renovated and used to be the old Broken Plate.  I think the owners are still the same.  

We decided to give it a try.  We ordered:
1) El Reys Flatbread - chokeful of meat on a flatbread - really tasty!
2) Beef Dip with salad - tender pieces of beef and great dipping sauce; salad was very light & refreshing.  Love the little carrot bits!
3) Lobster Gnocchi - Delicious  & creamy - just wished there was more. 
5) Kleftiko - Really well done lamb shank with a dark red sauce made with cherry tomatoes, parsnip mash.  That sauce was so rich!

A little on the pricey side but well done dishes."}
