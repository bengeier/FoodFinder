{"text":"The food at this restaurant is the truth!! Was very impressed! Had the veg platter & added meat & chick peas on the side and it was enough for 4 people and we even had some left overs!!"}

{"text":"A favourite hang-out among local Eritreans-Ethiopians.  Very well decorated and the atmosphere was great.  I ordered take-out and they offered me in house (traditional) coffee while I waited.  The food is very well priced and having spent a fair bit amount of time in Ethiopia, I have to say this is the best Ethiopian-Eritrean food i've had in Calgary!   They also have a pool table tucked in the corner"}
{"text":"Wow! First time eating Ethiopian food. Can't wait to go back to Hdmona.  Wonderful lunch."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new dining experience and I found an amazing on with this little restaurant in Calgary! The restaurant is in a non-descript location, upon entering the place we didn't think it was a restaurant because we were greeted by a pool table and a bar. There were some tables and chairs but the place was almost empty when we got there (shortly after 5PM). We almost walked out because we thought we were in the wrong restaurant; a lady came running after us. Thankfully she did.  They have a very small menu but it was well worth it. A young lady came to assist us with our order. She made some good recommendations and we all enjoyed the dishes. We had a mutton dish that reminded me of butter chicken; another was a beef and kale dish and the third one was a chicken and egg dish. All came served in a huge platter with loads of injera.  The food was tasty and very well spiced. Loved it! What would have made the experience so much better was a little cultural education (clearly we had never eaten Eritrean cuisine before). Nevertheless it was an awesome gastronomic experience and one that I wouldn't mind experiencing again.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Lots of men playing pool drinking beer. The waitress is young and pretty. She helped us order our food. The food was ok."}
{"text":"A colleague recommended this place, as I was looking for some different food. I have to say I was not disappointed at all, the food was delicious!!.. And very exotic!!.. The place is not fancy, so I just order to go. But this food was definitely great!!.. I recommend it 100%."}
